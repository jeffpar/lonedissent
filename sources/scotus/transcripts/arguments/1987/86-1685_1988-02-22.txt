ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES T. COLLETTE, ESQ.

6

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. COLLETTE:

8

9

We'll hear argument now in

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
What this case is is simply the Norris non­

10

11

retroactive liability holding revisited five years later.

12

this case deals solely with the relief aspect of Norris.

13

does not deal with the Norris liability holding.

14

And
It

In this regard, our contention is that what this

15

Court said about remedies in Norris, i.e., that pension plans

16

would not be liable under Title VII for the payment of benefits

17

attributable to pre-August 1, 1983 contributions, even though

18

such benefits were calculated using sex distinct mortality

19

tables.

20

That what this Court said in Norris bars the award of

21

relief herein because respondents before this Court are all

22

pre-August 1, 1983 retirees whose benefits are therefore

23

completely attributable to pre-August 1, 1983 contributions.

24

In. short, we are not proposing that a new rule of law be laid

25

down in this case.

Rather, we are simply asking that the

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

Norris relief rule be most emphatically underscored herein.

2

That prior to August 1, 1983, there will be no liability.

3

that subsequent to August 1, 1983, there will be and is

4

liability if sex distinct mortality tables continue in the use

5

of benefit calculation.

But

6

By way of a brief road map to my argument, I intend

7

principally, and possibly exclusively, to address this Norris

8

non-retroactive, this Norris relief issue.

9

cover the first and second alternative arguments in our Brief

10

for Petitioners unless of course the Court has any questions.

11

Those arguments deal with, respectively, whether in any event

12

Manhart and Norris bar the award of relief to the pre-Manhart

13

retirees in this case, and whether proration, at least under an

14

accrued benefit methodology should have been applied to the

15

award of relief to the post-Manhart retirees herein.

I do not intend to

16

If there remains time, I may briefly address our

17

third alternative argument on the Title VII exhaustion and

18

class scope limitation issues.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Collette, as a preliminary matter,

20

would you explain to me the mechanics of the plan that led to

21

males receiving lower monthly benefits than females?

22

the application of a sex-based table would not yield that

23

result.

24
25

MR. COLLETTE:

Normally,

Your Honor, it is the result of the

mechanics of a defined benefit pension plan.

The primary

benefit under a defined benefit plan, such as the FRS, is

2

calculated pursuant to a formula.

3

4

females.

5

mortality tables are used.

6

single life benefit to a present dollar value, when sex

7

distinct tables were used prior to August 1, 1983, the woman of

8

course had a greater primary single life value because she was

9

expected to live longer.

That produces an equal

When you go to joint annuitant options, then
And to reduce the future expected

Therefore, when you went to a joint

10

annuitant option, it resulted in her receiving a greater

11

monthly benefit in her joint annuitant than a similarly

12

situated male and his joint annuitant.

13

There's a good brief explanation in the 1983 Law

14

Review article by Hager and Zempleman, and also in the

15

Department of Labor's 1983 Cost Study.

16

The basic facts with respect to this central issue

17

are these.

pension plan with over 1100 plus Florida local governmental

19

employers participating there.

21

of several earlier Florida retirement plans.

22

The FRS, as I mentioned, is a defined benefit

its primary life benefit and as mentioned, it has had three

6

their joint annuitants, in response to your question, receiving

a lesser monthly joint annuitant benefit than similarly

From its inception in 1970 to present, in addition to

Prior to August 1, 1983, the FRS

However, effective August 1, 1983, and because of

10

this Court's Norris decision, the FRS converted to unisex

11

mortality tables for the calculation of its three joint

12

annuitant benefits.

13

situated males and females retiring since that time receiving

14

the same monthly retirement benefit.

15

And this has resulted in similarly

It should also be noted that all retirees under the

16

FRS obtain a vested contractual right to the full amount of

17

their retirement benefits which vested contractual right arises

18

as of the effective date of retirement and which vested

19

contractual right prevents the State from thereafter ever

20

subsequently reducing that retiree's benefits.

21

QUESTION:

May I ask at that point, is one of the

22

options available, at least pre-August 1, 1983, a lump sum

23

settlement?

24

MR. COLLETTE:

25

changed since creation.

No, Your Honor.

The options have not

QUESTION:

2

There was no lump sum.

If there had been, just to clarify the

3

question Justice O'Connor raised, if there had been a lump sum,

4

it would have meant that the female would have gotten a larger

5

lump sum?

6

MR. COLLETTE:

7

QUESTION:

That is absolutely right.

Because it's calculated backwards from

8

life expectancy at a fixed rate where they both get the same

9

amount.

10

MR. COLLETTE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. COLLETTE:

Yes, sir.

I see.
I think it is also important to

13

remember that there is no question that the award in this case

14

were it to be implemented, will be paid by the FRS for its 1100

15

plus FRS participating Florida Governmental employers through

16

increased contribution rates.

17

In short, as of January 1983, the FRS was in exactly

18

the same situation as 45 percent of defined benefit and 74

19

percent of defined contribution plans in this country.

20

plans, as the Department of Labor pointed out in its 1983 cost

21

study, had not yet as of such date converted to unisex

22

mortality tables for benefit calculation.

23

Which

Moreover, and when Norris came down, Florida promptly

24

complied therewith as mentioned by converting to unisex tables

25

for its benefit calculation.

On these facts, the District Court, disagreeing with

In essence, what this case boils down to is simply

whether Norris bars the award of retroactive relief in the form

of both prospective and retrospective adjustment of pension

Plaintiffs, as said, argue Norris has no

applicability and that Manhart clearly put pension plans such

3

as the FRS on notice that it could not use sex distinct tables

4

to calculate monthly benefits.

5

Zempleman pointed out in their 1983 Drake Law Review article,

6

Manhart created confusion and uncertainty in the pension

7

industry as to whether sex distinct mortality tables could

8

continue to be used in benefit calculations.

confusion and uncertainty was only finally resolved by this

quote, "reasonably could have assumed that it was lawful to

11

by insurance companies on the open market."

12

Moreover, the facts belie that the pension industry

13

viewed Manhart as requiring a wholesale conversion to unisex

14

tables for benefit calculation.

15

publications of the National Actuarial firms in the period

16

after Manhart stated to the effect that Manhart created more

17

problems than it resolved, and that the pension industry should

18

take a wait and see position.

19

For one thing, the

For another thing, and as previously mentioned, as of

20

January 1983, 45 percent of defined benefit and 74 percent of

21

defined contribution plans in this country had not yet

22

converted to sex neutral tables for benefit calculation.

23

In any event, Norris was not a narrow decision

24

limited on its facts solely to the issue of the Manhart open

25

market exception and third party insurers.

Rather, it is

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11
1

manifestly clear that the Norris non-retroactive liability

2

holding was meant to apply to all pension plans throughout this

3

country including the FRS.

4

clear that in Norris this Court intended to wipe the slate

5

clean as of August 1, 1983, for all pension plans in this

6

country.

7

if sex distinct mortality tables had been used in benefit

8

calculation, but that subsequent to August 1, 1983, there would

9

be liability if such tables continued in benefit calculation.

In other words, it is manifestly

That prior to that line, there would be no liability

10

The primary concern for the Norris non-retroactive

11

majority's denial of retroactive relief was its concern with

12

the impact a retroactive holding could have on pension plans

13

throughout this country, both private and public.

14

concern was not misplaced, given the percentages of plans which

15

the Department of Labor found in its cost study had not, as of

16

January '83, yet converted to sex neutral tables.

17

And that

Moreover, I think the fact that this Court took a

18

highly unusual action in Norris by delaying its judgment three

19

weeks underscores that the Norris decision was intended to

20

apply to all pension plans throughout this country.

21

there was no reason to provide a grace period for the Arizona

22

plan at issue in Norris because by the time that plan reached

23

this Court, its objected to provisions had been eliminated.

24

The key is that that grace period was effectively

2

That grace period was also effectively utilized by the New York

3

State Teachers' Retirement System in Hannahs v. New York State

4

Teachers' Retirement System and no doubt that grace period was

5

effectively utilized by thousands of pension plans throughout

6

this country.

7

In short, Norris announced a broad rule of relief

8

founded on policy and clearly intended to prevent a regime of

9

discretion which rule is applicable to all pension plans

10

throughout this country, both defined benefit and defined

11

contribution.

12

plans could continue to pay their retirement benefits to pre-

13

August 1, 1983 retirees even though those benefits had been

14

calculated using sex distinct mortality tables.

15

Which rule allows those plans and says those

Because of this, and because respondents before this

No.

Actually, the prospective award
It's been stayed in this

Yes, but all I'm saying is that no one who

received a benefit check prior to August 1, 1983 had that check

That is not entirely correct.

The

8

post-Manhart retirees had that check adjusted back to the

9

October 1 Manhart effective date in this case.

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

Right.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I don't want to add to the confusion

12

but supposing that someone retired say before 1978, received

13

retirement checks before the effective date of Manhart.

14

does this decree augment any of the payments that person got

15

for that period of time before '78?

16

MR. COLLETTE:

No, Your Honor.

Now

That person as of

17

April 30, 1986, it would augment his payments from that date.

18

But the funding and the actuarial evaluation it requires a

19

funding, that prospective award requires a funding of liability

20

that was not anticipated by the retirement system at the time

21

the individual retired.

Unless there are any further questions, I will

anomaly that it is the male here who has brought the claim and

2

who is receiving the lower benefit.

3

explained perhaps by pointing out that the familiar phenomenon

4

of an assumed longer life expectancy for the female which would

5

require in typical circumstances that a fixed amount of benefit

6

be extended over a longer assumed life time is precisely the

7

same type of impact that produces the illegal result here.

8

9

That can be simply

It's a bit disguised for the simple reason that it
arose in this case as a consequence of the choice made by the

10

men to elect a spousal protection option under which not the

11

single lifetime of the retired employee is considered but the

12

combined lifetimes of the two.

13

instance — and you can just work this out with a piece of

14

paper should you care to, and I'll assume figures to make it

15

simple —■ if you assume a 65 year old male retires and his life

16

expectancy is 70, then that person has a five-year life

17

assumption.

18

As a consequence of that, for

But if he's designating the protection of a slightly

19

younger female age 60, who would have a 75-year life

20

expectancy, her life expectancy is some additional 15 years.

21

The system simply looks at the longer of the two.

22

it doesn't add them, just looks at the longer of the two.

23

That's a 15 year payout.

24
25

Of course,

If you reverse that and you assume that you have a 65
year old retiring female who, with a 75 year life expectancy

Heritage

1

expects to live ten more years, and you add to that picture the

2

identical other facts, i.e., that she designates the protection

3

of a male spouse and give the male spouse the same age, 60,

4

with his lower life expectancy of 70, he's expected to live ten

5

years.

6

years.

7

Both the male and the female are expected to live ten

Those are comparable, identically comparable opposite

8

relationships between the male and the female retiring

9

employee, but because of the 15 year payout that's assumed for

10

the life expectancy that's extended by reason of sex, there

11

results the familiar downgrading of the pension benefit.

12

disguised in that it takes place in the male paycheck.

13

It is

The members of this class are not exclusively males.

14

They are males and they are also the surviving joint annuitants

15

of the males so in many instances, we have widows who are

16

participating in this class.

17

If I may mention another thing that has come up in

18

the argument that I think requires some clarification, counsel

19

has placed some considerable emphasis and twice cited to this

20

Court, a statistic by which he advises you that I think some 45

21

percent of the pension plans in this country are defined

22

benefit plans that as of 1983 when you decided the Norris case

23

had not yet converted to unisex.

24
25

He doesn't also advise this Court, so I shall, that
he's using a statistic which by his own admission doesn't

Heritage

19
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20

1

discriminate between employer operated plans and employer

2

sponsored plans.

3

throughout this country, even after Manhart, there were a huge

4

number of defined benefit plans employer operated, we must

5

assume if it's to be relevant to our case, which did not make

6

the switch to unisex until 1983, inferring to you the enormity

7

of a national impact.

8

9

So he's citing it to you to infer that

But the statistic on which he relies specifically
says that there has been no attempt to distinguish between an

10

employer operated plan and an employer sponsored plan in

11

developing that statistic.

12

33rd page of the State's brief, footnote 27, where they explain

13

that in detail, stating, and I quote:

14

And I invite you to look at the

"We'd quickly reveal that it covers all state, local

15

government and private defined benefit and defined contribution

16

pension plans with no distinction as to whether employer

17

operated or employer sponsored."

18
19
20

So the inference urged by counsel is not supported by
the statistic on which he relies.
Counsel has also made an argument in his oral

21

presentation to the Court that's not in the briefs and has

22

never been made before in any of the earlier judicial

23

proceedings affecting Florida v. Long.

24

the first time that the State of Florida occupies a position

25

analogous to that of a third party insurer because after all

Heritage

He says to us today for

21
1

the State of Florida is an umbrella or parent governmental unit

2

having enormous sub-tiers of other governmental units within

3

the State of Florida.
Clearly, this is something that's occurred to counsel

4
5

just recently in preparing his argument.

I would remind him,

6

and I respectfully point out to this Court that a stipulation

7

that they entered into, which appears in the Appendix, page 36,

8

completely belies any argument that would be predicated upon

9

it, and it's unfortunate that he has made that argument to you

10

11

of the Appendix, expressly says the following:

12

Stipulation No. 4, and I'm reading from the 39th page

"The State of Florida for the purposes of Title VII

13

14

authorized and charged under Florida statutes with the duty and

15

responsibility of lawfully administering the FRS.

16

party unrelated to the State of Florida is authorized to or

17

does administer the FRS."

No third

So counsel's argument, while it may have some appeal
to him, has been placed to rest deep in —

the Eleventh Circuit, was not argued to the trial judge below.

10

And I think the reason it never was is that the stipulation to

11

which I've just referred does appear to have precluded it.
The central theme of the argument that counsel has

12

13

made in effect is that in 1983, this Court laid down a rule of

14

amnesty with respect to pension plans.

15

said that a pardon is given with respect to Title VII

16

violations through the use of a sex based mortality table for

17

all kinds of plans, even those plans that had five years before

that been the subject of an earlier ruling of this Court in

Manhart.

Are we dealing with that?
In effect, you are dealing with the

the question cannot be isolated in that fashion as is evidenced

are the retired employees themselves who are making this

application on behalf of themselves and their joint annuitants,

QUESTION:

2

MR. MELVIN:

3
4

But that's different from Manhart.
Yes.

Yes, that question is different

from Manhart.
I would suggest to this Court that that type of

5

problem is not unlike two of the other questions that were

6

raised in Norris, decided in Norris, and yet were not thought

7

to be such a new and unforeseeable resolution of a rule of law

8

as would have invoked concerns about retroactivity or would

9

have led to discussions of proration.

10

In the Norris decision, the Court looked backward at

11

Manhart and found that there were two other questions in

12

Manhart that had not been addressed and answered.

13

Manhart of course dealt with the inequality in the

14

required contributions in the pension system.

15

as we do here, and as Norris did in 1983, with discrimination

16

at the payout stage in the monthly benefit check.

17

deal specifically with the question of whether an otherwise

18

liable employer for a violation of the Act could justify the

19

practice by offering a non-discriminatory option in combination

20

with the discriminatory option.

21

It did not deal,

Nor did it

When we read Manhart, we don't find answers to those

22

questions either, necessarily.

But when those questions were

23

addressed five years later in Norris, this Court disposed of

24

them without struggling over those questions as it did struggle

25

and split on the question of whether to extend the liability on
24
Heritage * Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25
1

an employer operated plan to the employer sponsored plan, which

2

were the facts before it in Norris.

3

The Court said with respect to the issue of

4

discrimination in the pay-in contribution stage versus

5

discrimination in the payout stage, "we have no hesitation at

6

holding, as have all but one of the other lower Courts ..."

7

and it went on to say that that type of new question could be

8

answered rather forthrightly in the negative.

9

Similarly, the Court said, "it is likewise irrelevant

10

that the Arizona plan includes two options."

11

dispose of that question.

12

It was illegal.

And went ahead to

If this is a question which the Court would address,

13

I think it would address it and come to the conclusion that

14

liability still attaches.

15

the consideration that this body undertakes that when it

16

reaches the conclusion, which I would submit should be that

17

liability still attaches, that this Court will not conclude

18

that it has announced a new and unforeseeable rule of law.

And I would suggest that if that is

19

Consequently, this Court would not conclude that to

20

impose that conclusion upon the State of Florida at this time

21

would lead to non-retroactivity considerations.

22

Now, if I may, what's being argued here essentially

23

is a per se rule of law.

24

there is a per se rule of defense beginning in 1983 as to which

25

all prior possible liabilities for a Title VII pension

this area.

And where there are

The primary distinction between what occurred as our

case came up through the court system and out of the Eleventh

8

9

this.

The Ninth read Norris, and we say misread Norris, to

10

establish a per se rule of defense for all pension cases

11

regardless of the type of fund that was involved, regardless of

12

how much money the pension fund might have, regardless of

13

whether the pension fund had an excess cash surplus, regardless

14

of whether it was a defined benefit plan or defined

15

contribution plan.

In other words, a blanket rule.

We submit to the Court that the imposition of a

judicial result.

I submit to you that in looking in broad terms at

2

which is the better result, that of the Eleventh or that of the

3

Ninth, we should come to the conclusion that the benefit of

4

taking the approach suggested by the Eleventh Circuit is simply

5

that it does permit a case by case individual pension plan by

pension plan analysis of impact, of the arguments in support of

proration, and any other matter which may on behalf of an

employer constitute a basis for an alleged defense.

announced a general rule of liability that what had been

illegal since 1978 in Manhart for an employer operated plan was

20

to now be extended to and similarly become illegal for an

21

employer sponsored plan, as was the case in Norris.

22

And then in Norris, the Court dealt with one of the

very important aspects of that case which differ from ours.

some clear implications of that type of plan.

Mr. Melvin, one sentence in the Court of

Appeals opinion in this case, when it's dealing with

retroactive relief says, "the. District Court's refusal to

14

I gather then some evidence was offered to kind of

make this a case by case thing and the district court didn't

kind of national concern on how many other possible plans

generically similar to this one might be impacted by an outcome

in this case.

4

for instance, it overlooks the inferences that this Court in

guarantees no claimant damages, guarantees no claimant any

particular outcome.

8

9

I think that that's a wrong approach in that it,

It grants to the Federal trial judge, the discretion
to fashion such relief as the circumstances may require, and

10

within his discretion, that might be merely declaratory, merely

11

injunctive in certain respects.

13

this flexibility is the desirable thing.

It may or may not in his
And

And I think when we look at the facts of the case

that were tried in Florida, we see why that was so desirable.

And if I may, I'd like to turn to some of those facts because

17

this fact unique case, when we look at some of those features,

18

I think it becomes clear to us as to why the Federal trial

19

judge was not convinced.

20

Remember the difference between the Eleventh and the

21

Ninth is that the Ninth reads Norris as giving a rule of law

22

about the defense.

23

the Eleventh Circuit itself took the approach that there is no

24

absolute rule but that there are these defenses of which you

25

can avail yourself if you can prove the adequate facts.

The trial judge in the Eleventh Circuit and

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

These

30

people were unable to prove those adequate facts.
The first thing that we put in proof below, which I

2
3

think was especially convincing, was a memorandum written by

4

the State Retirement Actuary two years before you decided the

5

Manhart case.

prophetic memorandum written by the State Retirement Actuary,

7

it's a statutory position in Florida.

8

And in that memorandum, it's an absolutely

His job is what it

13

as the one that was in Florida, could not lawfully use sex

14

based mortality tables.

15

recommended that before the year 1977 began that they abolish

16

them.

17

And he came back from that

And since he didn't think so, he

And in that memorandum, he said, just briefly, that

18

there was a general thrust taken by the Equal Employment

19

Opportunity Commission by which their — and I'm quoting —

20

"now is a very strong possibility that actuaries will no longer

21

be permitted to use mortality standards which provide for the

22

use of differentiation in the rate of mortality by sex."

23

And I think it's interesting because when Manhart

24

came up about 24 months later, this Court divided on the

25

liability questions.

And some of the Justices in the minority

Heritage

30

on liability expressed some concerns about the validity of

2

unisex actuarial tables, the availability of them to various

3

employers, the general practicality of proceeding to require

4

the use of unisex tables.

5

In the facts of the Florida case, it's clear that

6

those expressed concerns were not a problem for the Florida

7

facts and this State Retirement Actuary explains.

8

mortality rates on a single unisex basis has been found quite

practical for non-insured plans which have been shifting over

He went on to explain exactly what the probable

13
14

illegality of the plan would be.

15

that when actuarial tables are sex segregated, this frequently

16

results in the payment of different periodic pension benefits

17

to males and females under the guise of actuarial equivalence.

18

He specifically said, this will violate the 1964 Civil Rights

19

Act.

And in the last page of his memorandum, his

recommendation to his boss was, "in light of the strong

24

add the evidence was that he got no reply to that memo — when

3

the Manhart decision came down, he wrote another memorandum.

4

This one is dated May 19, 1978, and it was very short.

said, I am attaching some option factors that we can use to

straighten out the sex based tables in Florida.

because if they had made that switch in 1978 when they knew

14

they should have, you simply adopt a unisex table which is an

15

averaged result of the higher male rate and the lower female

16

rate or the reverse of that if you apply it here.

17

an aggregation of the two and since you're dealing with

18

nonvested rights, you simply reduce one class and increase the

19

second class, and you strike a unisex level of benefit for both

20

sexes.

21

Anyway, it's

And they're talking about that as a no-cost approach.
And they said,

"Mr. McMillian identified the reason

22

for not developing a no-cost unisex approach before 1983.

23

reason was because the no cost approach would result in a

24

reduction of benefits to over one-half of the membership, i.e.,

25

women.

That

The Court then went on to say, in its conclusions,

"the State simply did not want to make the politically

4

unpopular decision to reduce female benefits.

5

to maintain the discriminatory status quo."

The State chose

13

and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed him for doing it, permitted a

The trial judge quite correctly,

better for the Ninth Circuit at the trial level to have had a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES T. COLLETTE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MR. COLLETTE:

9

Just one point.

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
The stipulation petition appendix,

11

page A-106, paragraph 4, was simply made for the purposes of

12

Title VII to recognize the use of the word, employer, as it's

13

used in the definitional section of Title VII, which the law

14

recognizes is quite broad, covers agents, etcetera.
It resolved the issue that the only entity needed to

15
16

be sued in this case was Title VII; that is all.

you argue in the lower courts that the State was in the posture

No.

there are over 1100 and we kept reemphasizing that point

factually that there are over 1100 plus local governmental
