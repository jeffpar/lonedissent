ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. LINTON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF
MR. LINTON:

7
8

South Carolina invoked the original jurisdiction of

10

this Court to protect its sovereign right to borrow money.

11

South Carolina seeks to issue its general obligation bonds

12

which pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the

13

State without intrusion by the National Government.

14

the future of State revenues are pledged to retire the debt

15

represented by the bond, the power to borrow here is

16

inextricably linked with the obligation to tax to retire that

17

debt.

Because

Twenty-two States have joined South Carolina as

18
19

amicus and the National Governors Association has sought to

20

intervene as a plaintiff.

21

}

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

1

Mr. Linton, you may proceed

Congress, by TEFRA Section 310(b) asserts the right

22

to tax the general obligations of the State of South Carolina.

23

Thus, Congress claims the right to tax the State revenue.

24

claims the right to interfere with the State of South Carolina

25

2

registration requirement interfere with the States' right to

3

borrow and it operates as a tax upon the tax revenues.

4

I would like to point out a few findings of the

5

Master which I believe are critical to the correct disposition.

6

The Master found that the loss of the tax exemption threatened

7

is a penalty of such severity that the States have no choice.

8

The Master pointed out that prior to TEFRA, every State issued

9

its bonds in bearer form and that since the Statute has been

10

passed, no State has issued its bonds in bearer form.

11

have all surrendered the right to issue their instruments

12

because of the sanction that's been imposed.
QUESTION:

13

)

The sanction and the

They

Yes, but Mr. Linton, the Master also found

14

that there was very little economic loss to the States as a

15

result of that choice, didn't he?
MR. LINTON:

16

The Master did find that, Your Honor.

17

And I'll turn to one other finding of the Master that I think

18

that is adverse to us that is of interest to the Court.

19

Master said that the interest of the States in bearer bonds

20

goes to the form and not to the substance.

21

finding.

22

The

We except to that

It's incorrect.
The issue on the registration requirement and the

23

matter in which the States issue its bonds is the right of the

24

States to determine what conditions in their bond instruments

25

the State feels would appeal to the marketplace.

It's the same

interest expressed by this Court in Bland v. Free in dealing

2

with the savings bonds of the United States.

3

that if the States could interfere with a survivor ability

clause in that instance, it would threaten the right of the

5

United States and its ability to borrow money.

6

right that we are asserting here.

7

QUESTION:

This Court held

That's the same

But is it a purely dignitary kind of

8

interest, that is, do you concede that there's no economic harm

9

to the State of South Carolina that results from the TEFRA

10

Section 310?

11

MR. LINTON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LINTON:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.
What then is the economic harm?
Well, first of all, the Master found

14

that in certain circumstances there would be economic harm.

15

The Master found that 76 percent of the bonds issued in this

16

country are under $10 million and that registration requirement

17

would cause extra expense to the State.

18

We don't measure the issue here, Your Honor, though

19

by the cost in the registration.

20

sought original jurisdiction here because the sanction

21

threatens the right of the States in an impermissible way and

22

in an impermissible area.

23

QUESTION:

It's the sanction.

And we

You know, a long time ago, Chief Justice

24

Marshall and I think it was the M'Culloch against Maryland,

25

said the power to tax is the power to destroy, and Justice

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Holmes came along a hundred years later and said, the power to

2

tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.

3

seems to me you're making an argument that probably would have

4

appealed a great deal to Chief Justice Marshall but perhaps

5

hasn't weathered too well in later opinions of the Court.
MR. LINTON:

6

And it

Your Honor, we think it has weathered

7

well, and if I may point out one other finding of the Special

8

Master, he noted the significance in the State constitutions

9

when it comes to the issuance of State bonds pledging general

10

obligations.

And the Master said, the power of taxation and

11

spending associated with that right to raise funds through debt

12

issuance are essential to the exercise of sovereignty.
Now, Your Honor, I'll turn to the New York decision

13
14

because I recognize that in both Massachusetts and New York,

15

you have discarded the rhetoric of the power to tax is the

16

power to destroy.

17

New York was that if you have a commercial enterprise that you

18

may tax the State there and we're not just going to have a

There seems to be some disagreement on that

MR. LINTON:

We believe the proper

threatening the imposition of an unconstitutional sanction?

14
I

Mr. Linton, do we look at this as a tax or

MR. LINTON:

That is at the core of it, Your Honor.

15

And the other aspect of it is that part of the right of the

16

States recognized in this immunity from taxation by the

17

National Government as to debt which is backed up by its

18

general obligation taxing power is to tailor that instrument in

19

a manner in which the State feels is most appropriate to

20

market.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what if we accept all of the

22

Master's findings of fact, which, as the Chief Justice

23

suggests, indicate basically that in this particular instance,

24

it's not a terrible burden economically on the States.

25

what if we accept that?

3

You want us to rely primarily on the old Pollock case
and intergovernmental tax immunity, is that right?
MR. LINTON:

Well, we ask you to rely on the Pollock

4

case to the extent that it is still the law of this Court.

5

we also point to the Massachusetts case in which what the Court

6

said is that we're not going to get caught up in a question of

the taxing power.
QUESTION:

Well, at bottom what does it rest on

textually in the Constitution do you think?
MR. LINTON:

The tax immunity doctrine, Your Honor?

14

The tax immunity doctrine is bottomed on not only the Tenth

15

Amendment but the nature of the compact.

16

agreement whereby the National Government and the States were

17

to maintain sovereignty.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

There was an

Can States today tax the interest income

on Federal government issuances of securities?
MR. LINTON:

No.

The answer is, no, and under the

21

Rockford case, I think the issue that was decided by this Court

22

last June so long as the interest on those bonds is a pledge of

23

the United States, we would not be able to tax those revenues.

24
25

QUESTION:

So you take the position that all these

State municipal bonds pledge the credit of the States or the

8

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

municipalities?

2

MR. LINTON:

The issue that we invoke the

3

jurisdiction on is a general obligation bond which pledges the

4

full faith credit and taxing power of the State of South

5

Carolina.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Linton, are you saying that any

7

Federal regulation of the States' authority to raise money by

8

issuing bonds is unconstitutional?
MR. LINTON:

9

A regulation that interferes with the

10

right of the State to borrow.

11

QUESTION:

And you're saying interfering with the

12

right of the State to borrow here even though only tiny

13

economic consequences may flow.

14

MR. LINTON:

Of course, the issue is not the economic

15

consequences.

The issue, as far as the registration goes, is

16

the invasion of the right of the State to determine the terms

17

of the debt instrument.

18

Bland v. Free as applied to the United States was incidental to

19

the right to borrow, and not to be interfered with by the

20

States.
QUESTION:

21

And that's, this Court recognized in

Yes, but of course the United States and

22

the States do not operate on a totally two-way street in our

23

system.

24
25

MR. LINTON:

Your Honor, we recognize that.

But what

this Court said in New York was there's an irreducible core of

1

federalism.

2

concerned with the rights of the States when you're dealing

3

with taxation.

4

are unique characteristics of the States.

6

happens to tax the States as States.

sought to be imposed here.

9

And there, Justice Frankfurter was particularly

formally, the tax is not laid upon the States.

I mean,

If we had a

10

statute that says, any issuer of debt securities shall pay a

11

tax of X dollars, then we would have a tax on the State.

12

is a tax upon the receipt of income by an individual, so it's

13

one step removed from a formal tax on the State, and therefore

14

it seems to me the only way you can get at it is to say, well,

15

it's not formally a tax on the State, but it's effect is such

16

that -- and then you get into discussions about indeed how

17

severe is the effect, and it's acknowledged that it's pretty

18

negligible.

19

MR. LINTON:

This

Your Honor, you're correct in one sense,

20

that you said that it's a tax on the bond proceeds of the

21

owner, but from the standpoint of the way this Court deals with

22

that, you have held that it is a tax on the State and it is an

23

interference with the right of the State to borrow.

24
25

That's not just going back to Pollock.

Last June,

this Court decided the Rockford Life case, the test that you

10

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

used for a debt instrument that was guaranteed by the United

2

States was as far as the interest payments, you said that would

3

be on the United States.

4

resolve the issue adverse to the United States because it was

5

not the issuer, it was only the guarantor.
QUESTION:

6

Now, in that case, you did not

What about a sales tax, the burden of

7

which is borne by the purchaser.

8

individual who is purchasing something with the income that he

9

has received from a State bond cannot be charged that sales tax

Would you say that an

10

because after all, the only purpose of getting the money from

11

the State bond is to spend it, and if you tax that spending,

12

you trace it back to the money coming from the State, you're

13

burdening the State.

14

Would you say that?

15

MR. LINTON:

No, sir.

And the Court's rejected that

16

argument, but the Court has accepted the proposition that when

17

you interfere with the right of the State to borrow, you

18

interfere impermissibly with the State.

19

QUESTION:

Why doesn't that interfere with the right

20

to borrow?

21

right to borrow.

22

State money is to get the interest.

23

the interest is to spend it.

24

right to spend it.

25

That's what I'm saying.

That interferes with the

We're saying the only reason you loan the

The only reason you want

The Court makes the distinction between

the attenuated effect on the sales tax example, or on the tax

2

of employees versus the States obligation to tax in the future.

3

The States, that effects on the bond aspect, when you're

4

dealing with general obligations, is the obligation of the

5

State to tax its citizens to retire that debt, it interferes

6

with the power of the State to borrow.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask you, supposing Congress passed a

8

statute that said all bonds in issues over over $2 or $3

9

million, something like that, must be registered.

That would

10

impose the same burden on the State that you have here, only in

11

a different way.

12

13
14
15
16

MR. LINTON:

It would be unconstitutional because it

invades the right -QUESTION:

Insofar as it was enforced against the

State, it would be unconstitutional?
MR. LINTON:

Yes, sir.

It would be unconstitutional

17

because it invades the right of the State to determine the form

18

of its instrument and to tailor it to the marketplace.

19

But in this case of course, it's unconstitutional as

20

well because of the sanction that it seeks to impose, it robs

21

the States of any meaningful alternative.

22

Master found.

23

That's what the

The United States is not excepted to it.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Linton, what if Congress said in

24

their commerce power that no one who buys one of these bonds

25

may transfer it without registration, and the practical effect

Heritage

12
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of that is to also make the States have to register their

2

bonds.
MR. LINTON:

3
4

its commerce power here.
QUESTION:

5
6

Your Honor, Congress was not exercising

Well, I'm saying, what if.

Can Congress

do that?

7

MR. LINTON:

We think that a different test applies

8

under the taxing power.

9

commerce power if it had the effect of regulating the States

If Congress did that under the

10

where there was no meaningful choice, I think we would be back

11

to the issue that was addressed in the dissent in New York by

12

Justice Douglas that these tax regulations have a tremendous

13

regulatory effect and they would rob the States of the ability

14

to govern their own citizens.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I understood even your intervenor,

16

National Governors' Association, thought Congress could do what

17

I suggested.

MR. LINTON:

18
19

But you take issue with them?
I think you introduced a predicate that

if it was so coercive that they had absolutely no choice.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I said the practical effect of it is

21

going to be that States are going to have to register their

22

bonds.

23

MR. LINTON:

Well, Congress could do, perhaps under

24

the Commerce Clause without invading the sovereignty of the

25

States, because then the States would have chosen to go into an

area that is regulated under the Constitution, interstate

commerce is regulated exclusively by Congress.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS B. KADEN, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF-IN-INTERVENTION

13
14

MR. KADEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The National Governors' Association does not think it

15
16

necessary to reach the tax immunity issue which Mr. Linton

17

argued.

18

in this case is whether Congress can enlist the State

19

legislatures to its service in order to achieve a national

20

goal.

21

Rather, we submit that the question squarely presented

That principle, the principle that Congress may not

22

so enlist the State legislature has survived through all the

23

twists and turns of federalism jurisprudence in this Court, and

24

has been most recently reaffirmed in the case of FERC v.

25

Mississippi.

The principle is a simple one: whatever else

1

Congress may do pursuant to the delegated powers, it may not

2

reach out into the circle of authority reserved to the States

3

and conscript the State legislative machinery and put it to use

4

to advance a national goal.

5
6

QUESTION:

You will come to how this conscription has

been effected?

7

MR. KADEN:

8

When Congress in this case said to the States, you

9

Yes, indeed.

must register your bonds by December 31, 1982, the consequence

10

of that was that each State had to adjust the agenda of its

11

legislative and regulatory bodies in order to accommodate its

12

laws to this new requirement.

13

And the record shows, for example, that in Kansas, 47

14

statutes had to be amended.

15

adjustment of their statutes to the registration requirement

16

had to be put on a special agenda of the legislature, and then

17

the legislature had to come back to make a further adjustment.

QUESTION:

Well, the States could fully not register

declined to adopt the 55 mile speed limit, and the only

consequence would have been their loss of highway funds.

The only consequences would be tax consequences to

MR. KADEN:

I think the difference in the measure of

9

coercion is significant here.

10

QUESTION:

11
12

You're talking about the degree of

coercion, that's the —
MR. KADEN:

That's right.

And that coercion is

13

reflected, as I indicated, in the fact that the legislative

14

history indicates no intent to raise money and no effect of

15

raising revenue.

16

said in Kahriqer means it's not a tax.

17

The combination of the two, as this Court

Further and pursuant to that Congressional finding,

18

the parties stipulated before the trial that this was a

19

requirement, and the Master so found and the Solicitor General

20

agrees that that's the better way to view it.

21

Now, viewing it as a requirement —

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KADEN:

24

QUESTION:

25

May I just interrupt for a second?
Yes.
You said degree of coercion.

Wouldn't the

amount of money lost in highway funds exceed in monetary value

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

the economic loss of the cost of registration?
MR. KADEN:

No, I think far from it.

The penalty in

3

the South Dakota case, if I remember correctly, was five

4

percent of available highway funds.

5

if the States failed to register an issued taxable bond would

6

be 28 to 32 percent of their total borrowing cost, billions of

7

dollars a year.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

Here, the increase in cost

No, but I thought the Master found that

the economic cost of compliance was really rather trivial.
MR. KADEN:

Exactly.

The economic cost of compliance

11

was trivial, but the economic effect of the sanction was

12

enormous and the coercive effect comes from that.

13
14
15
16

But in addition to the coercive effect, you have the
finding and the stipulation.
QUESTION:

You can coerce them but not effectively,

that's the principle?

17

MR. KADEN:

18

QUESTION:

Here the effect was complete.
I mean, that's a strange constitutional

19

principle, isn't it.

I mean, it's okay to apply the coercion

20

but not enough to be effective.

21

MR. KADEN:

No, I don't think so.

Here, the coercion

22

was completely effective.

to help them out with, you have the same kind of a problem.

2

The States have to crank up their machinery and do something

3

about it.

4

MR. KADEN:

You don't have the compulsion to pass

5

laws.

In circumstances where the State has attached a

With great respect to learned counsel from South

seek to move us away from arguments having their roots in

refinements unrelated to affairs.

As I've indicated, the United States will make no

that was your premise, you would still I think not have cause

2

for worry because, as the Special Master found -- and his

3

findings are entirely consistent with the intentions of

4

Congress -- the Special Master found that this form of tax in

5

no way, in no way burdened the ability of the States to raise

6

revenues through borrowing, and indeed in no way affected how

7

they borrowed, what form they borrowed, except in that holy

8

question begging sense that of course they could no longer

9

borrow in bearer form.
But as far as their ability to enter the market, the

10
11

terms on which they entered the market, whether long term or

12

short term and at what interest rates and for what purposes

13

they borrowed, the Special Master found that this simply had no

14

effect whatsoever.

15

And that being so, I don't see why these —
You don't think the means selected should

Is there no other way the government could have

MR. FRIED:

There are other ways, certainly.
Sure.
But there is nothing improper about this

means.

The reason there is nothing improper about this means

22

even on your premise which you offer on a hypothetical basis

23

because the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity,

whatever its present status, is not some kind of a taboo; it's

a principle.

And if in actuality the ability of the States to

way affected, then surely that has some bearing on how one

considers the matter.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Fried, if I understand your argument,

it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a statute that

change which the municipal market would have gone to of its own
