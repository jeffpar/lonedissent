ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES FRIED,ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In this case the Plaintiff Respondents were
terminated from the Social Security disability roles and

10

subsequently their disability benefits were restored either

11

through the appeals process or by new application, and they

12

were restored retroactively either through the appeals process

13

or in compliance with the 1984 Reform Act.

14

Separately, they brought this Bivens action against

15

the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Commission of

16

Social Security; and the head of the state agency charging that

17

their due process rights, their constitutional rights, had been

18

violated in that those three individuals had caused them to be

19

subject to advertently inaccurate and legally unwarranted

20

determination which resulted in the loss of their benefits in

21

the first instance.

22

Our contention is that whether or not there was a due

23

process violation here, and whether or not ultimately the three

24

individual defendants are found to be qualifiedly immune, this

25

cause of action is precluded for three reasons:

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

it is

1

precluded by the statute itself; it is precluded because the

2

statute occupies the field and is a comprehensive scheme so-

3

occupying the field; and it is precluded because there are here

4

special factors counselling hesitation.
Taking the statutory preclusion first, 405(g)

5
6

provides an unusually capacious system for raising any kind of

7

claim, statutory or constitutional, and allows a wide variety

8

of relief:

9

constitutional as well as statutory claims to be read.

class action relief; injunctive relief, and allows

10

405(h) says that this scheme is to be the exclusive

11

scheme for raising issues regarding social security benefits,

12

and the third sentence, the second sentence — one might say,

13

says what you must do — which is to have recourse to 405(g)

14

scheme; and the third sentence, what you may not do.

15

What you may not do is try an end-run around the

16

405(g) scheme by having recourse to Section 1331 General

17

Federal Question jurisdiction, which is precisely what the

18

Respondents did in this case.

19

The second reason that this cause of action is

20

precluded is that there is here an unusually comprehensive and

21

complex scheme, which over — which occupies the field.

22

it's a scheme which is not only complex, but is continuously

23

fine-tuned by Congress, so that Congress has, as it were, not

24

only laterally, but over time, occupied this field, so that it

25

quite inappropriate to overlay that scheme with a personal

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And

1

action for damages against high government officials out of

2

their own pockets.

3

4
5

And finally, there are special factors counselling,
hesitation.
Now, these three bases for preclusion are each of

6

them in our view quite sufficient to dispose of the claim.

7

in fact they converge and work together.

8

scheme precludes a Bivens action here because the scheme is so

9

comprehensive.

10
11

12

The 405(g) and (h)

And the scheme is so comprehensive because of

the special factors which counsel hesitation.
Congress was surely aware how contentious it was to
deal with and to take away or to deny social security benefits,

3

and the numbers of cases in which these contentious issues

4

would arise.

5

So these three reasons are separately, but they work

6

together jointly as well, and together they make quite clear

7

that this is not a case in which the Bivens action is

8

appropriate.

9

I would suggest that after a certain amount of

20

oscillation, this Court came to rest in Bush v. Lucas on the

21

proper role of the Bivens action.

22

in which the argument proceeded.

23

But

There were two extreme poles

One pole would have had -- and no member of this

24

Court I believe ever took up a position there -- one pole would

25

have said that there must be constitutional damages where there

1

is a constitutional right, and that damages are specified by

2

the Constitution itself.

3

clause carry with it a constitutional damage remedy in the way

4

that this Court in the First English case last term, said that

5

the 'just compensation" clause is a constitutionally-mandated

6

damage remedy.

7

That would make every constitutional

The other way, the opposite pole, was taken up by

8

Justice Black in his dissent in Bivens, which said,

9

the Congress has specifically authorized the Court to grant a

10
11

'only if

damage remedy, should there be one.
Where Bush v. Lucas came to rest is to see that there

12

is here an interpretive partnership between the Court and

13

Congress, a partnership which, in the end, should leave the

14

area of law with a scheme that makes sense.

15

partnership in which Congress is necessarily the senior

16

partner; it is the senior partner because it's been recognized

17

that Congress can preclude a damage remedy; and Congress can

18

act in such a way — and this is where I think Bush

19

contributed, can act in such a way that it no longer makes

20

sense to imply that damage remedy which otherwise the Court

21

under 1331 would have the power to do.

22

But it is a

Now, this case seems to us to be just like Bush.

23

There is one and only one point of departure, and that is the

24

obvious fact that persons who are terminated from social

25

security benefits are often likely to suffer greater hardship

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

than those who have been fired from federal jobs.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. FRIED:

4

QUESTION:

5

And there are many of them.
There have been many of them, yes.
However, the initial determination has

been upset.
MR. FRIED:

6

There have been many of them.

We have

7

set out in our brief the finding from the Senate Report

8

explaining why those initial determinations are likely to have

9

been upset.

New evidence comes in at later stages; the ALJ

10

stage is the first stage at which there is a personal

11

confrontation with a decisionmaker, so I don't think it would

12

be appropriate to lay all the incorrect decisions at the door

13

of callousness or malice.

14

The hardship is greater, but it is a kind of hardship

15

which this Court specifically confronted in Mathews v.

16

Eldridge, and there held that post-termination restoration of

17

benefits were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due

18

process.

19

Working in the opposite direction, this case seems to

20

us clearer than Bush, because the fine tuning which Congress

21

has engaged in, is a fine tuning which has occurred frequently.

22

Congress has revisited this problem time and time again, and

23

has in fact addressed many of the complaints which are raised

24

in this case.

25

And most importantly, unlike Bush, the constitutional

7

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

violations, if they occur, occur in the course of an

2

administrative, adjudicative process, such that the process

3

itself carries with it a means for redress.

4

The crucial point in our view is that the Respondents

5

are profoundly wrong in saying that it is necessary to imply a

6

Bivens remedy, lest the Respondents here are left voiceless in

7

respect to their constitutional claims, lest their

8

constitutional wrongs remain voiceless, because we have in

9

405(g) a remedy which this Court, together with Congress, and I

10

think this Court particularly, has made particularly receptive

11

to all kinds of claims, and most recently in the City of New

12

York case.

13

in the City of New York case, we had precisely the

14

same complaints that are being raised here in this case.

15

the Court found a way to make 405(g) perfectly adequate to

16

respond to those claims.

17

And

So those claims, whether constitutional or statutory,

18

whether factual or legal, can be raised and can be raised

19

within what has been described as the unusually protective

20

scheme of 405(g).
QUESTION:

21

What the Respondents are saying, General

22

Fried, is that's a remedy, but a remedy for a different wrong;

23

that they're not complaining here about the denial of benefits.

24

Those sections will indeed allow us to remedy the denial of

25

benefits.

Heritage

8
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

But what they're complaining about is not the denial,

2

but the denial of due process that led to the denial, and

3

that's what they want a remedy for.

4

MR. FRIED:

They are, of course, complaining of the

5

denial of benefits, but they add adverbs to that complaint:

6

they say we were denied benefits and we were done so illegally,

7

unconstitutionally.

8

9

They complain that 405(g) gives them a remedy for
everything but the adverbs.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FRIED:

Now it seems --

What damages are they seeking here
They are seeking damages for emotional

12

distress and the Complaints states that they are seeking

13

damages for loss of the food, medicine, and other necessities

14

which they were deprived of.

15

Now, there is a certain puzzle about that, because

16

there is, of course, they received the financial award with

17

which they would have purchased that.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. FRIED:

They did get benefits retroactively?
They did.

All three of them.

Chilicky

20

got them, not as a result of the administrative process, but in

21

compliance with the 1940 and 1984 Act, but all three have

22

received retroactive benefits, so that the Complaint must be

23

for what we must describe as consequential damages:

24

distress; and the loss that comes about from not having had

25

that money when you wanted it; and where obviously, you could

6

have used it; and perhaps when you desperately needed it.
QUESTION:

General Fried, is their claim comparable

to the claim the Court sustained in First English?
MR. FRIED:

I don't believe so, because the First

English case dealt with a Fifth Amendment taking violation.
QUESTION:

I understand the legal theory is

7

different, but they, in effect, are saying it's not enough to

8

give us our property back after all the litigation is over.

9

10
11

And that's what the Court said with respect to the
interference with the use of property in that context.
MR. FRIED:

The Court certainly did.

But the reason

12

that the Court came to that conclusion, and it focused its

13

conclusion on the point was that the Constitution itself in so

14

many words, requires "just compensation."

15

So the damage remedy awarded in First English was a

16

damage remedy which was itself required by the Constitution.

17

And that is how the Court in, may I say, rejecting a suggestion

18

of the Solicitor-General, decided that case.

19

20

QUESTION:

In adhering to a precedent that had been

decided some fifty years before, you might also say.

MR. FRIED:

It was an exciting case.

of circumstances; a constitutional provision which carried with

2

it its own damage -- a constitutional remedy -- and which was

3

focused quite specifically on traditional kinds of property,

4

which this Court has several times held social security

5

benefits are not.

6

QUESTION:

I'm not sure the plain language is quite

7

as persuasive as you make it, because the clause says,

8

property shall be taken without just compensation."

9

doesn't say there shall be just compensation; they went ahead

And it also says, "No person shall be deprived of
property without due process of law."

the negative.

MR. FRIED:

QUESTION:

No.
And that, I think, is — thereby hangs

that particular tale, I would suggest.
QUESTION:

You would say that you remedy the one by

22

providing the "just compensation" that was not provided; and

23

you remedy the other by providing the "due process" not

provided, I presume?

25

MR. FRIED:

Well, that, I would say that the

process."

This Court has said -QUESTION:

no constitutional requirement that you do so.
And yet, Respondents argue as if there were a
constitutional requirement that you do so.
QUESTION:
when it's too late?

Well, how do you supply the "due process"
Do we do that in damages?

How do we do

that?
MR. FRIED::

Well, you supply the "due process" by

applying due process, and that means in this case, you give
that which, if you have taken away that which the law says you
should not take away, you think again and you said,

"No, we

were wrong;" and you give it to the person.
Now, there is no additional requirement that you also
pay something extra for having gotten it wrong the first time.
QUESTION:

Is there a requirement that you give

retroactive benefits?
MR. FRIED:

There is a statutory requirement that you

do so.
QUESTION:

Is there a constitutional requirement?

For the purposes of our determining whether or not there is a
Bivens action?

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. FRIED:

1

The fact that there are retroactive

2

benefits, I should think, would help mightily in determining

3

whether what 405(g) has done here is sufficient to displace a

Bivens action.

5

constitutional requirement that you give retroactive benefits.

6

After all, if a person has been incorrectly imprisoned and is

then released because a constitutional error has been made, the

complete, at constitutionally complete, answer is he is now a

9

free man.

I don't believe that, absent Bivens, there is a

There is no constitutional requirement that he

somehow be compensated from what might be years of unjust

11

incarceration.

QUESTION:

But you would say that, in determining

whether there should be a Bivens action here,

of the compensation is highly relevant?

MR. FRIED:

It is certainly relevant.

It is relevant

16

just as it was in the Bush case, where the compensation was

precisely what it is here in this case.

I should say that Bush being fired is indeed

stigmatizing.

unwarranted stretch.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The Respondents in this case spent their working

6

lives paying into Title II's disability insurance program, and

7

they have no quarrel with its comprehensive design, the one

8

that the Solicitor-General praises,

9

benefits; how errors are reviewed and corrected; how

for deciding who gets what

10

mistakenly-withheld benefits are to be recovered from the

11

Government.

12

recovered, and they don't really complain about where Congress

13

chose to locate what the Solicitor-General in his reply brief,

14

calls the "ballast of the social security system;" how tight a

15

ship Congress chose to run.

16

As he correctly points out, the benefits were

Their point is, they didn't fall overboard; they

17

allege that they were pushed.

18

individual Petitioners in this case deliberately abused this

19

well-designed machine; and abused their power by setting

20

arbitrary quotas.

21

"adverbs" of constitutional import, even if one doesn't agree

22

to the exciting First English decision.

And their complaint is that the

And these, we think, are not simply

23

part of Justice Stevens' dissent that suggests that when there

2

3

That's a

And it has been quite traditional for courts to

4

recognize intentional abuse of process as a tort quite distinct

5

from any benefits lost and recovered along the way according to

6

the exclusive government system for recovering those benefits.

7

I think Judge Friendly was the first to see it in the

8

Title II context in the Second Circuit in 1981 in Ellis v.

9

Blum, when he held that abusive termination of Title II

10

benefits, which are later restored retroactively, give rise to

11

a Bivens action under 1331 for emotional distress and

12

consequential damages.

13

Actually, he may not have been the first, although

14

the context was a bit different.

15

Pierce, in the Ninth Circuit, held that, when state officials

16

deliberately and for unconstitutional reasons, interfere with

17

the attempt of a licensed applicant to obtain the license, the

18

fact that the license is ultimately obtained according to the

19

normal course of the normal process does not prevent the 1983

20

action seeking consequential damages and damages for emotional

21

distress for the deliberate abuse of the process putting them

22

through the ringer, when they ought not to have been put

23

through it.

false picture when he says --

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice:

they claim in

the Complaint, and the case arose on the dismissal of that

7

Complaint -- they had arbitrary quotas saying a fixed number of

Of course, they haven't had the chance through

discovery to prove it.

19

entitled to absolute, but only qualified, immunity.

And they want a chance to prove it, not as the

21

Solicitor-General suggests, by somehow reconstructing this

22

comprehensive machine that Congress has ably developed for

23

getting back the benefits that were wrongfully withheld; or

24

mistakenly withheld; you don't have to show any wrong; it's an

25

honest mistake -- to get the benefits back.

altogether;

provisions as a navigation chart using the historic,

traditional, common law remedies as a compass; and it is that

it is a system that this Court began to construct

As to the individual benefit denials -- if

a particular respondent felt that he had been "tossed off"

because deliberately they were paying no attention, he could

have challenged that in court, could he not, under the Social

12

Security Act?

3

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, as the Solicitor-

4

General calls them, "generous provisions of 405," he could have

5

run immediately to court, and that is what it appears, the

6

Solicitor-General counsels, that the best solution is not

damages which might deter this misconduct, but judicial

interference without even exhausting remedies, he suggests,

immediate declaratory and injunctive relief.

The reason that this case is not here under 405(g) and

Heritage

18
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

as I can -- that 405(g) and (h) are fine provisions designing a

2

limited waiver of sovereign immunity for getting something from

3

the Government.

4

When 405(g) and (h) were written in 1939, it would

5

have been quite impossible, as the Solicitor-General points out

6

in his brief, to preclude Bivens remedies -- impossible,

7

indeed, because it was to be three decades until a right of

8

action under Bivens for this kind of abuse was recognized by

9

the Court.

10

But the fact is that that limited exposure of the

11

federal treasury under 405(g), and the Court called it "a

12

limited waiver of sovereign immunity" under City of New York v.

13

Bowen, does not, as the Solicitor-General suggests, purport to

14

provide, as he put it in his words, an "exclusive scheme for

15

raising all issues regarding social security benefits."

16

The fact that social security benefits exist in the

17

background did not prevent Judge Friendly from seeing in Ellis

18

v. Blum that these claims arise under the Constitution, and not

19

under the Act.

Mr. Tribe, could I ask you:

suppose there

hadn't been any constitutional violation and simply a denial of

23

it was wrongfully denied.

same kind of damages that you ask us to give to your clients

Now, surely the people who were

for here.

They too, could have been deprived of their

residences; evicted; or whatever else.

They could have had all

those consequential damages; but Congress has chosen to give,
as relief, only the amount of money that should have been paid,
even though the same consequential damages would have been
fair.
Now, don't you think that that may be some indication
of what Congress wants to be done with respect to any Bivens
claims that there are?
MR. TRIBE::

Well, there are several answers, I think,

Justice Scalia.
First of all, the fact is that here, unlike the Civil
Service area, Congress did not calibrate what it wants to be
done to the existence of any abuse.

Congress simply provided a

way of getting these benefits delivered to the right people.
QUESTION:

But why not the consequential damages

along with those benefits, which would follow?
MR. TRIBE:

It seems to me that, to answer the

question of what Congress sort of had in mind in this area as
it revisited it over and over," as the Solicitor-General says
it did in the '80s, it is important to understand what was
going on in Congress during the period when this fine-tuning
occurred.
Late last week, in Bowen v. Galbreath, this Court
pointed out that, when it fine-tuned one of the titles; that

20

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

is, when it passed Title XVI of the Act, Congress, in a telling

2

omission, did not include certain language that had appeared in

3

Title II.
And that led me to inquire over the weekend what

4
5

proposals did Congress have before it that might bear on this

6

question, during the period of the 1980s when it was fine-

7

tuning the delivery system?
And the fact is that in December 1981, ten months

8
9

after the Second Circuit had applied Bivens to the abusive

10

termination of Title II beneficiaries, Secretary Schweiker, the

11

Petitioner in this case, joined several other Cabinet members

12

in officially urging Congress to pass S.1775, which would have

13

ended Bivens liability for most federal officers, including

14

most particularly, officials of Health and Human Services, when

15

plaintiffs allege what Secretary Schweiker called

16

"constitutional torts" in the denial or termination of

17

benefits.

18

this Court took note of in Carlson.

19

That law had some predecessors in the late '70s that

1775 would have actually given liability damages from

20

the U.S. Treasury from the people who were cut off as for

21

others who were denied Bivens remedies.

22

on really two grounds; first that it was not sufficiently

23

protective of victims; and second, that it wouldn't deter

24

future abuses well enough.

25

And yet it was opposed

In the end it died in committee.

And Majority Leader

21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Baker in January 1984, said on the Senate floor, that Bivens

2

reforms of that kind had proved too controversial to press as

3

part of any other kind of reform.

4

Later that year, unanimously, Congress passed the

5

Social Security Reform Act of 1984.

Now, to take from history,

6

where Congress is adjusting and fine-tuning the system for

7

returning benefits withheld by honest mistake, to take from

8

that the lesson in this partnership between Congress and the

9

Court, that Congress has implied a negative with respect to

10

Bivens actions, for abusive termination, seems to me to take

11

the possibility of employing implied repeal of the Bivens

12

background much further than is justifiable.

13

I don't think you can read either in what Congress

14

did in 1939, before anyone dreamed of Bivens, when it was

15

really enacting a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, for

16

what it did do in the 1980s as somehow suggesting that it

17

wouldn't make sense for this Court to do here what it did in

18

such cases as Bivens and Davis and Carlson.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

This case seems a lot closer to Bush

against Lucas than any of those, I must say.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice O'Connor, the principal

22

reason that is given by the Solicitor-General that this is a

23

lot like Bush against Lucas in his brief, is that the social

24

security system is too big; too complex; and the remedies are

25

too comprehensive.

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

The remedies, as I have just tried to indicate, are

2

remedies against the system for failing to deliver what it

3

promised, not for those who deliberately abused the system.

4

But the suggestion that it's vast; and that its size

5

is somehow the criterion that should make it rather like Bush,

6

the elaborate civil service system, we think is not defensible.

7

In Bush, and indeed later in Chappell and in Stanley,

8

the special factors were all quantitative;

they related not

9

to size, but to subject matter, like the commitment of federal

10

personnel policy, or the incidence of military status to the

11

political branches.

12

Size; complexity, I don't think provide a judicially-

13

manageable line.

14

is too big and too complex; then why not the federal law

15

enforcement administration?

16

In any event, if the social security system

That is, Bivens itself imposed damages remedies in a

17

context where there are tens of thousands of law enforcement

18

officers; why not prison administration?

19

20

Mr. Tribe, of course there you have the

same complex remedial system in the law enforcement area.

21

MR. TRIBE:

22

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia asked you about -- you may have the same kind of

24

damage from statutory violations.

I wonder if you could not

23

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

violations; arbitrary quotas; the same things you allege here;

2

but as the result of carelessness and poor staffing and all the

3

rest rather than as a result of deliberateness?
My question is, is your emphasis of deliberate

4
5

wrongdoing because you think that's a part of the

6

constitutional violation, or you think as a matter of prudence,

7

the remedy should be so-limited?
MR. TRIBE:

8

We think, Justice Stevens, after Daniels

9

and Davidson, that it's part of the constitutional violation.

10

From the point of view of the poor person who can't

11

buy food and medicine, whether the deprivation is the result of

12

some arbitrary quota or some honest mistake, may be a matter of

13

only academic interest that he couldn't really care much about.

14

But this Court, I think, made a point, of which I

15

know that in those cases you were not in full accord, that the

16

ordinary concept of constitutional command draws a line between

17

deliberate abuse of power and honest mistakes; the kind of

18

thing that, in First English could happen as the regulatory

19

process drags on.
And we do not think we could make out a procedural

20
21

due-process, or an equal protection violation, for mere honest

22

error.

23

this notion of abuse of process as a constitutional tort, is

24

that the abuse be knowing, intentional and deliberate; and

25

that's what we seek to be able to prove at trial.

We think that, therefore, the fundamental predicate of

1

So there would be a defense in this case

if the Secretary put on evidence that he got bad staff advice;

3

a complete difference?
MR. TRIBE:

5

Well, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Court

8

thought he was complying, it was constitutional.
QUESTION:

9

There may well be in

the two, sometimes, though not always -- certainly not in

14

Stanley — sometimes coalesce.
But the concern that officials not move with great

15
16

trepidation, fearing that every error of judgment in running a

17

massive bureaucracy may expose them to liability, is quite

18

well-dealt with by Harlow v. Fitzgerald immunity.
QUESTION:

19
20

And is emotional distress recovery lie at

the core of this violation that you posit?
MR. TRIBE:

21

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think emotional

22

distress and other kinds of consequential damages lie at the

23

core.

24

separately, judicially, cognizable if provable.

25

Certainly in Carey v. Piphus, emotional distress is

And in the Flores case in the Ninth Circuit, that was

25

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

at the heart of it.
But let me return for a moment, if I might, to

2
3

Justice O'Connor's question about Bush v. Lucas, because I

4

think there is a deeper irony here, in that making the

5

magnitude of the system, its complexity a special factor

6

counselling hesitation under Bush, if you go back to the

7

majority opinion in Bivens and the Justice Harlan's

8

concurrence, both of those opinions stressed that damage

9

liability is especially appropriate for federal officers

10

because of how much power they can wield; how many people they

11

can hurt.

12

It inverts, I think, the logic in Bivens to say that

13

the more people an official can hurt, the less a court should

14

worry about ordinary garden-variety compensation and

15

deterrence.

16

The fact is that Petitioners in this case were in a

17

position to inflict more injury without ever getting out from

18

behind their desks, than the agents in Bivens could inflict by

19

breaking into Bivens' home.

20

You don't have to send agents to grab the social

MR. TRIBE:

No, Chief Justice Rhenquist.

My

17

suggestion is that, if they deliberately set out to send that

18

kind of message to people without regard to whether they really

19

are disabled, then in that case it is plausible to say that

20

this is not just an "adverb" of constitutional import; it is a

21

deliberately-inflicted stigma.

22

QUESTION:

Well, but to say it's deliberately

23

inflicted would be right; but to say it's a stigma is something

24

else, I think, because I thought our cases used the word,

perhaps as a badge of obloquy or something like that.
And I just don't think that a determination that
you're no longer disabled carries that connotation.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, some might regard it as good news

5

to be told that you are no longer disabled, but others might

6

say that if they spent their working lives putting into a

7

system, and are then told that they're lying about their

8

disability, which is what this message is, it might be

9

stigmatizing.

11

But I'm not sure this bears on the question whether
there should be a Bivens action.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure it bears on a question of

if that's what it is, is the same whether it was done

Once again, the obloquy,

Well, of course the ALJ —

the same; your client is lying in this hospital bed; he gets

exactly the same news; and you're telling us that in the one

consequential damages; whereas under the statute, where the

That may be quite true, but then you

it's been a deliberate violation of the Constitution.

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, if I am understood as

suggesting that stigma retroactively colors the existence of a

violation, I don't mean to be suggesting that.

18

And it's somewhat premature to talk here, I think,

threshold -- and answer one way or the other to the question

withheld as a result of a deliberate violation, then in

calculating the damage, the lost health — which will have

that this had no relationship to particular evidence in the

had to have it in their heads that this Court in 1994 in the

8

Hertado case said that such arbitrary action violates the

9

Constitution, I'm not sure.

10

I suspect that, in order to be liable of deliberate

11

constitutional abuses of this kind, officials do not have to

12

couch their improper intent in constitutional terms; but they

13

would surely, though I'm sure that this is somewhat of a

14

different issue, the Harlow v. Fitzgerald defense, if they

QUESTION:

"No action against the United States, the

gave that less than a literal reading in Bowan against Michigan

Academy?

MR. FRIED:

The Michigan Academy case is very

important on that point because the Court recognized that it

2

had -- that it was rowing uphill; but that it was willing to do

3

so because, had there not been a remedy that was implied under

4

1331, there would have been no way for those particular claims

5

to be brought before any court whatsoever.

6

And that, this Court said, was weighing powerfully in

7

their interpretation; second, it found a little bit of leeway

8

because in any event, I believe the Court said, in any event,

9

we are not operating directly under 405(h) in the third

10

sentence; but only by its incorporation through Section 1395,

11

that was a Part B of Medicare case.

12

That would seem to me to suggest that, if you were

13

square in the middle of 405(h), rather than in one of those

14

peripheral applications dragged in by reference that you would

15

not have had the same conclusion.

16

The attempt to do in rungs around the third sentence

17

goes back to Weinberger against Saifi, the attempt to say,

18

well, this is a declaratory judgment; well, this is procedural;

19

this is prospective-only.

20

Each time the Court has said, look, what you are

21

doing is something which has to do with getting benefits.

22

These people didn't slip and fall on the steps of the Social

23

Security office and bring an action for that reason; they are

24

bringing an action because something that happened in respect

25

to the granting of benefits.

So I think 1331 -- I think that 405(h) is quite clear

on this point; I do think that it's important to have a little

perspective on this case, particularly given the very powerful

presentation of the factual context.
First, the respondents at page 6 of their brief say

that there are perhaps 200,000 people whose benefits were

unjustly terminated and then later reinstated.

In times of economic dislocation in the late '70s and

18

early '80s, when most of these cases arose, were such times,

19

there is tremendous pressure on the system and on Congress to

How to respond to those pressures is a serious
