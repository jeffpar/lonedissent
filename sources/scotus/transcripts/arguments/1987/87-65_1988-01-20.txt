Mr. Parrillo, you may

proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. PARRILLO, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PARRILLO:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

The issue presented by this matter is whether the

10

Respondents should be held in criminal contempt for publishing

11

materials in violation of a temporary restraining order where

12

no attempt was made for judicial relief of that order.

13

On November 8th, 1985, Mr. Raymond J. Patriarca

14

brought suit against the Providence Journal Company, a Rhode

15

Island newspaper, as well as a Rhode Island television station,

16

WJAR-TV,

the Justice Department and the FBI.
Mr. Patriarca at the same time filed an injunction

17
18

motion seeking to enjoin dissemination of information which was

19

about him, which had been obtained as a result of illegal

20

electronic surveillance by the FBI.

21

That dated back to 1962 to 1965, when the FBI quite

22

illegally entered into Mr. Patriarca's father's business, and

23

they planted electronic bugging devices.

24

recordings made of those conversations over those several

25

years.

There were tape

Those tape recordings have since been destroyed, but
3

1

logs and memoranda regarding them have been retained.

2

Some years ago, back in the seventies,

the Providence

3

Journal sought to obtain those FBI materials and litigation

4

regarding that was unsuccessful.

5

prevail in that after the matter was decided at the 1st Circuit

6

level.

7

They did not ultimately

After Raymond L.S. Patriarca, that's Raymond J.

8

Patriarca's father, when the senior Patriarca died,

thereafter,

9

the Journal renewed its attempts to obtain the FBI materials,

10

and those renewed attempts were successful arid they obtained at

11

least some materials from the FBI regarding these illegally-

12

obtained conversations.

13

Shortly after the complaint was filed, there was a

14

temporary restraining order conference where the Chief Judge of

15

the Rhode Island District Court, Judge Boyle, Chief Judge

16

Boyle, had counsel gather.

17

as well as the WJAR-TV were present in arguing that any kind of

18

restraint would be a prior restraint and would be illegal.

Counsel for the Providence Journal

The Government defendants likewise represented by the
U.S. Attorney's Office.
The Judge was apparently very concerned that there

22

were paramount 1st Amendment rights which may be or which would

23

be impinged if you were to enter any kind of order.

24

he set the matter down for hearing or intended to set the

25

matter down for hearing the next day and issue a temporary

MR. PARRILLO:

No, Your Honor.

The temporary

restraining order conference was on a Wednesday at about 12:30.

QUESTION:

I see.

I wonder if you could offer

19

anything to indicate to us that perhaps it was proper for the

20

Judge to have entered it.

21

and I wondered if you had.

22

MR. PARRILLO:

I confess I couldn't find anything,

Well, Your Honor, it's true that the

23

1st Amendment -- any order impinging is going to be

24

presumptively invalid.

25

No question about that.

But, here, Mr. Patriarca had filed a motion and an

MR. PARRILLO:

The Journal, in and of itself, could

9

instantaneously at that point.

10

The Judge, however, was not certain about that
In fact, Your Honor, within six

days, he vacated his order.
But at the time that it was issued, he was concerned

11
12

with what, to him at least, seemed to be a novel issue

13

concerning an asserted constitutional right by Mr. Patriarca,

14

and irreparable harm would befall Mr. Patriarca, and he had

15

just come recently, I guess, within the last few weeks from a

16

1st Circuit conference where this entire area had been

17

discussed.

18

There was, as I say, the litigation having to do with

19

the prior attempts by the Journal to obtain this material, and

20

the 1st Circuit at least suggested that Congress had made it

21

clear, as clear as possible,

22

illegal electronic surveillance was an insidious invasion of

23

privacy, and that --

12

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. PARRILLO:

11

All of the people?

Once we start doing that, we are going to

get into some trouble.
QUESTION:

14

Here's my problem, Mr. Parrillo.

If you

15

say that you're not covered by the statute somehow because

16

you're not really the United States or you're the United States

17

in a different sense, in this class of suit, then what happens

when,

25

At that point, Your Honor,

would.

628-4888

yes,

QUESTION:

1

Can the United States Attorney petition

2

for certiorari even though the Solicitor General and the

3

Attorney General don't want it?

4

MR. PARRILLO:

No, he couldn't, because that would

5

become an executive function once the Justice Department

6

accepted it.
QUESTION:

7
8

But it's the same suit; it's the very same

prosecution.

9

MR. PARRILLO:
QUESTION:

10

Well, —

I take it that the Solicitor General

11

doesn't believe his authorization was necessary for you to come

12

here.

13
14

MR. PARRILLO:

He does not, Your Honor.

He's

confirmed that.

15

QUESTION:

Footnote 2 of his brief indicates that.

16

MR. PARRILLO:

He does, Your Honor, and later in his

17

memorandum regarding the motion to dismiss, he says the same

18

thing again.

19

appreciate that.

20

It's certainly a difficult question.

QUESTION:

I

Does that answer mean that you think if

21

anybody walks in off the street and tries to bring an appeal to

22

this Court in a federal case, so long as the Attorney General

23

says it's okay, it's proper for us to entertain it?

24
25

MR. PARRILLO:

Well, that statute says that if the

Attorney General authorizes it first and then it's all right

I still say it's important for us to know who we bill.

us to be here or it does not.

Young didn't speak to what happens in this Court.

22

It doesn't apply to the Court of Appeals and to the District

23

Courts. So, Young didn't speak to this.

2

you'll address some of your remarks to the question on whieh

3

this Court voted to grant certiorari.

4

MR. PARRILLO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

What happened at this conference was critical, at the

6

temporary restraining order conference, because the Judge

7

indicated that he would hear the matter tomorrow,

8

morning, presumably because it was of such constitutional

9

proper tions.

10

the next

In response to that invitation, the Journal lawyers

11

and the media lawyers said, no, we cannot go forward tomorrow,

12

we need more time to prepare. In response to that, the case was

13

put over another day. The request for postponement was granted,

14

and then the violation occurred in the interim.

15

Before the violation occurred,

there are several

16

things of extreme importance that did not occur, and that is

17

that the Journal did not go back to the trial judge to seek to

18

vacate or to stay the order.

19

had so much problem with it that they had to violate it,

20

it was such a sense of urgency that they couldn't live with it.

21

They didn't indicate that they
that

They did not go to the Court of Appeals to seek to

22

vacate it or stay it.

They did not seek an emergency appeal at

23

the Court of Appeals level, although that right is available to

24

them in these sorts of situations.

They did not apply, as Mr. Justice Brennan asserted, to the

judge.

They did nothing, except violate.
The publication was the next day of the matters that

2
3

they ought not to have published, and the basis of our argument

4

on the merits is that courts are the only body that are

5

empowered by the power of this country to determine cases.

6

Private litigants are simply not authorized to do so.
The Respondents in this case seized Article III

power.

12

went ahead.

They made themselves the court and not just made

They

The basis of our being here on the merits is that we

14

suggest that lawful review is required and that Walker v. The

15

City of Birmingham requires that where there are facially

16

available procedures for judicial review, you must try to take

17

them, and if, at that point, you're denied meaningful

18

opportunity,

19

can later contest the merits on a collateral attack at the

20

contempt proceedings.

21

then that's a different story and perhaps then you

But in this case, there is no excuse or no attempt at

22

all to proceed.

The explanation perhaps may be that the

23

Journal considered any question or any answer by any court to

24

be beyond their belief in that they would not be beholden to

25

any court that might restrain them.

MR.

It has to be a lawful order before

there could be any punishment for contempt of it,

7

QUESTION:

yes.

And do you think that any temporary

10

MR.

PARRILLO:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

12

is probably the best example, where the Court said that

jurisdiction, and in that interim period of time when they're

mulling it over, brief time, granted, but in that span of time,

they have the authority to hold matters in status quo in order

17

to make these determinations.

The United States is interested in this ease in any

ordinary use of that word, at least. There's no question but

3

that Mr. ParriJlo is not the Attorney General or the Solicitor

4

General, and not only does not have their authority but was

5

explicitly denied that authority in a letter from Solicitor

6

General Fried annexed to his brier Tiled in this Court.

7

Solicitor General Fried wrote in a letter of July 2,

8

1987, "To the extent that such authorisation is necessary,

9

however, I decline to authorize such a filing or appearance in

it's still up to the Solicitor General and Attorney General to

13

decide whether review would be proper?

14

MR. ABRAMS:

Justjce Stevens,

It has been continued through the years

QUESTION:

I understand the plain language argument,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

but do you think if Congress had asked itself the question, do

2

we want the Attorney General to decide in the case in which he

3

is interested as an individual, as opposed to the United

4

States, is he able to control review, do you think Congress

5

would have said yes, we still want him to do it?
MR, ABRAMS:

6

Yes, I think Congress would have said we

7

want one place to go out of which the position of the United

8

States of America comes to the Supreme Court of the United

9

States, and that to the extent that there is self-interest,

10

there will always be self-interest by some branch of government

11

about some course of conduct, and that the Congress, having

12

decided to put the power in the executive branch, said that is

13

where it should repose.

14

Now, an argument has been made, Justice Stevens,

15

which is at least quasi-constitutional in nature.

16

the Solicitor General's brief, and it is a separation of powers

17

argument.

18

goes along the lines that, I don't think I'm being unfair to

it, that Congress cannot put the power there because this is

20

instinct in the judicial power.

I think one of the places the Court might look or

think about looking there is a case not cited in our brief

25

question of whether the President could pardon someone

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

convicted of contempt of court for violating a judge's order,

2

and Chief Justice Taft, writing for this entire Court,

unanimous court, held that while it was possible that a

4

President could everyone convicted of contempt of court, and

5

thus effectively destroy the judicial power to protect itself

service of protecting the institution of the judiciary.

It seems to me —

9

QUESTION:

10

Of course,

that's a constitutional

12

decision interpreting the power of the President rather than

12

the statutory interpretation question of what Congress might

13

have intended in a situation like this.
MR. ABRAMS:

14

Absolutely, Your Honor, except insofar

15

as the argument made against us is the separation of powers

16

argument that Congress could not provide the executive branch

17

with this power and it is to that that I am responding.
QUESTION:

18
19

Would there be any problem here if the

special prosecutor had headed the case up differently?
MR. ABRAMS:

20

21

I'm not basing this on the special prosecutor using the words

22

"United States".

Turning to the merits of the case, I would start
first with the proposition that although my brother here does

Heritage Reporting Corporation

not concede error of the trial court, he necessarily comes

2

awfully close, and I would urge upon that beyond error, we have

3

a case here which, in the words of Chief Justice Vinson in the

4

Uni Led Mine Workers case, any claim to jurisdiction was

5

frivolous and not substantial.

6

In that case, and in other cases, this Court has made

7

clear that judges do not have carte blanche to enter any

orders, even when counsel first come into judicial chambers and

9

seek temporary relief.

Mr. Abrams, if we were to adopt that point

of view, we would not be following the judgment or the

get as far here as saying the trial court had jurisdiction to

enter the TRO?

18

MR. ABRAMS:

No, Your Honor. I mean, that is the

19

first question and my answer to that question is he did not

20

have jurisdiction to enter the TRO because the claim to

jurisdiction itself was so frivolous.

5

6

that the Court would not be, and in United States v.

Nonetheless,

this Court has made clear through the

7

years, at least as I read the UMW case,

8

some category of case as to which the claim to jurisdiction is

9

so weak, so previously decided, so lacking in any viability at

that there is at least

10

all, that there is no jurisdiction, so to speak, to decide

11

jurisdiction in a binding fashion.

12

Suppose, for example, counsel in this case had simply

13

come in on the Freedom of Information Act, no reference to the

14

4th Amendment, no reference at all to Title III, and this case,

15

this Court had previously decided in Chrysler v. Brown,

16

there is no jurisdiction, the word the Court used, no

17

jurisdiction for a reverse Freedom of Information Act, the

18

case, it seems to me, Your Honor, that that is not only binding

19

authority but, for purposes of the later contempt action, just

20

the sort of authority which should lead the Court to say the

alleged contemptor should not be liable for violating that

order.

At least that's the way I read the UMW.

the easiest case, it would be hard to see any circumstance

19

under which an order of this Court could, even in the most

optimistic moments of counsel, be deemed transparently invalid,

21

and, so, that would fail. I mean, there are some arguments one

simply cannot make, and I think, that would be such an argument.

So, to the extent one focuses on transparent

invalidity or some such notion, frivolous pretense to validity,

MR, ABRAMS:

I think

15

the answer to the Court of Appeals is yes,

16

I think what the Court of Appeals meant to leave open is a

17

situation where you had no decision from the Court of Appeals.

18

After all, it was the Court of Appeals which, in its ruling,

19

speaking about itself, said that it was left with no clear

conviction that an answer could have been had.

QUESTION:

You could have found a judge within that,

couldn't you?

That's right.

That's right.

think that that's what they were speaking to, really.

I have only a final word to add on the last of our

arguments.

QUESTION:
one question?

6

MR. ABRAMS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
One of the elements that your opponent

8

stresses is the fact that at that conference, counsel for the

9

newspaper seemed more or less acquiescent to a two-day delay,

10

partly because the questions were novel and he might have

11

needed time and so forth, so there was a little bit of an

12

element of almost a consent order.

13

tha t.

It isn't.

What if it had been, though?

14

I understand

What if the lawyer had

15

nut understood the time pressures on his client and had said

16

expressly, I'll stipulate to the entry of this order which

17

enjoins us for forty-eight hours?

18

that he really pulled a boner.

19

violated it and it was transparently true that lie could not

20

have entered such an order. Would that be enforceable in your

21

view?

Before you get to that, may I just ask you

He got back and lie found out

And then they went ahead and

It's a prior restraint.
MR. ABRAMS:

If counsel quite literally stipulated to

23

the entry of a prior restraint, and if there was jurisdiction

24

in the court, —

QUESTION:

Correct.

MR. ABRAMS:

— assuming that for the
Lhe moment, I think

2

he'd probably be bound by it.

QUESTION:

But this —

What if, just to take it a little step

4

closer, what if he said, I have no objection to that order,

Your Honor?

went through it and said that certainly seems reasonable, I

7

need time myself anyway, this is pretty close to that.

The other asked for it.

MR, ABRAMS:

He said, you know, he

I really don't think it is, Justice

Stevens, and this is a case in which counsel, and the record, I

10

think, is clear on this, opposed and only opposed the entry of

11

the prior restraint.

12

of opposing counsel, which is in the record, the testimony of

13

Mr. Patriarca's counsel is there, and he testified that there

14

was never any agreement or any acquiescence at all in the

15

order.

Ho never acquiesced in it.

The testimony

What counsel said is that it violates the 1st

Amendment.

18

a mistake when the Court — what happened was that counsel of

19

Patriarca, when the judge said I'll hear you tomorrow, counsel

20

for Patriarca said, well, T have something else, but I think I

21

can get out of it, I'll call Judge so and so and make

22

arrangements, counsel for the newspaper then said, well, I'd

23

like another day to prepare.

Counsel then made a mistake.

It’s not a venal sin.

No question. He made

came in and demanded, so to speak, expeditious consideration

10

from this Court and the Court treated it, so to speak, as a

waiver.
That is not what happened. Jt is much more similar to

the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and

the 9 tii Circuit excused counsel for having said that in the

So, Your Honor, it is really not acquiescence in the

order, and I urge upon you that the testimony of counsel and
