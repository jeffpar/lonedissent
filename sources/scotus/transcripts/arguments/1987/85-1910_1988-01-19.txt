ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY V. MCGOWAN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETIUONER

8
MR. MCGOWAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This antitrust case arises under Section 1 of the

11

%

We'll hear argument next in

12

Sherman Act, and involves an allegation of vertical price

13

fixing.

14

who bought calculators from Sharp Electronics Corporation, and

15

resold those calculators to their customers.

16

It concerns two independent dealers in Houston, Texas,

The jury below found an agreement between Sharp and

17

Hartwell, Hartwell being one of the dealers in Houston, to

18

terminate the petitioner, Business Electronics, the other

19

dealer in Houston, for the purpose of eliminating price

20

cutting, an agreement to eliminate price cutting.

21

On appeal, Sharp did not contest the sufficiency of

22

the evidence supporting that jury finding, but instead the

23

issue in this appeal is whether an agreement to stop price

24

cutting by terminating the price cutter is a per se violation

25

of the Sherman Act.

The Fifth Circuit below held that such an

agreement did not constitute price fixing. The Court said that

i

a finding of price fixing required literally an agreement to

charge resale prices at some level.
The decision below, which carves out conspiracies to

3
4

eliminate price cutting from the definition of resale price

fixing.

suppliers and dealers who wish to achieve adherence to resale

prices could simply collude to terminate dealers who refuse to

13

charge those prices.

Instead of agreeing on price directly,

Second, a conspiracy to terminate dealers who don't

14
15

comply with the suggested resale prices is clearly a form of

16

resale price maintenance under the decisions of this Court.

17

This Court has never limited the definition of vertical price

18

fixing to direct agreements on price.

In Parke, Davis and

the Court said that resale price

maintenance need not take the form of an actual agreement on

It's enough for the plaintiff to show collusion to

difference between a direct agreement on price and a conspiracy

to terminate dealers because they charge lower prices.

would only charge list price all the time, and that the price

cutter was always cutting below list.

4

was it?

5

Was it established here that the non-terminated dealer

MR. MCGOWAN:

That wasn't established,

It was established here, Your Honor,

6

that the terminated dealer was continually discounting and it

7

was established that the non-terminated dealer wanted to avoid

8

that discounting.

9

QUESTION:

But sometimes discounted himself.

He

10

wasn't always selling at the manufacturer's suggested retail

11

price, was he?

12
13
14

MR. MCGOWAN:

There is evidence that he sometimes

discounted himself, Your Honor, but -QUESTION:

So you really can't say for sure that by

15

terminating the other one for discounting, what you were

16

establishing is in effect the manufacturer's suggested retail

17

price, or at least we don't know that for certain.

______________ ______ ___________

18

MR. MCGOWAN:

"

5

What we can say for certain is that a

19

price cutter, a firm that was clearly charging lower than the

20

manufacturer's suggested resale prices was taken out of the

21

marketplace in order to get rid of that price cutting.

22

a form of an agreement on price, because it's in effect an

23

agreement which says these lower prices should not be charged

24

by that dealer.

QUESTION:

This is

agreement to eliminate a price cutter reflect an agreement to

presale promotional practices, instead?
MR. MCGOWAN:

3

Well, Your Honor, that contention was

raised in this case,

and the so-called free riding concern,

In this case, the evidence showed that in

fact, the plaintiff, Business Electronics, was not a free

10

There was never any complaint from Sharp that he wasn't

QUESTION:

The complaint from Sharp was that he

Well, the facts may show that, but it

11

would seem to me that it speaks to whether there should be the

application of a per se rule, or not.

MR. MCGOWAN:

25

QUESTION:

As to price

Well, I don't think you've, at least not

to my satisfaction, completely answered Justice O'Connor's

1

question.

You say that the free rider consideration shouldn't

2

be taken into account here, but why shouldn't they.

3

we're talking about economic utility and that sort of thing,

4

why shouldn't that consideration along with many others be

5

taken into account?
MR. MCGOWAN:

I mean, if

certain level of minimum promotional services, there are far

9

less restrictive alternatives than vertical price fixing, which

10

can be used to remedy free riding to the extent it's a problem.
QUESTION:

11

Free rider means a failure to provide a

12

restrictive alternative in a statutory case, and it's not a

Because free riding is a ready label

QUESTION:

1

Then your argument is not how much that it

2

doesn't deserve consideration and evaluation of the legal

3

principles, but just that whatever consideration it should get

4

shouldn't apply here because this really wasn't a case of free

5

riding?
MR. MCGOWAN:

6

This wasn't really a case of free

7

riding, and as to vertical price restraints as opposed to non­

8

price restraints, free riding should not be a rationale for

9

undermining the per se rule itself.

Now, where you're talking

10

about something that amounts to price fixing, these free rider

11

concerns should not be used to justify price fixing?

12

QUESTION:

But why not?

13

MR. MCGOWAN:

If you look in the literature, Your

14

Honor, on the subject of free riding, you can look high and low

15

in that literature, and there is almost no empirical basis for

16

it.

17

phenomenon is something that is pervasive in our economy, or is

18

something that should be used to justify —

There is no basis for assuming that this free rider

19

QUESTION:

You know, some of us — I dare say all of

20

us -- have had some experience of going to some very full line

21

dealer and you know, getting the stuff demonstrated and that

22

sort of thing, and then you go to some discount house and buy

23

it there.

24
25

MR. MCGOWAN:

Your Honor, another problem with free

riding is that it prevents consumers from exercising their
freedom of choice.

A consumer may choose to buy a product at a
8

Corporation

1

lower price, even with less service.

2

be cases of the so-called free riding you've described, those

3

cases are probably so narrow and so unusual, that they do not

4

justify applying a broad based rule that would undercut the per

5

se rule.
QUESTION:

6

And even though there may

Well, doesn't the manufacturer have an

7

interest in protecting, to a certain extent, dealers that do

8

provide full service and provide advertising and that sort of

9

thing?

10

MR. MCGOWAN:

The manufacturer can achieve that

11

interest through contractually requiring those dealers to

12

provide a minimum level of service, to provide a minimum number

13

of salesmen, to provide a minimum showroom floor, and he can

14

terminate those dealers for refusing to comply with those

15

contractual requirements.

16

The manufacturer can also impose non-price vertical

17

restrictions subject to the rule of reason.

18

territories and customers, for example.

concern in our economy.

I am proposing a broad rule if he's being

MR. MCGOWAN:

6

But your principle is you can never

Your Honor, the rationale for the per

7

se rule is based on a judgment that certain practices are

8

likely to be predominantly anticompetitive.

9

an agreement to eliminate price cutting -- that's what the jury

And we submit that

10

found here, and that's what the evidence supported -- an

11

agreement to eliminate price cutting is predominantly

12

anticompetitive.

13

Now, when you apply the per se rule, the per se rule

14

is applied for the sake of litigation efficiency, and business

15

certainty.

16

where the per se rule catches conduct that doesn't have a

17

terribly anticompetitive effect, but for the sake of litigation

18

efficiency and business certainty, the per se rule was applied.

19

There may be cases, there may be individual cases

Here, I think it can be generally said that an

20

agreement to stop price cutting by terminating price cutters is

21

predominantly anticompetitive.

22

It deserves the per se rule for that reason.

23

QUESTION:

It's clearly a price restraint.

Why would the manufacturer want to cause

24

his products to be sold at a higher price, unless he had

25

something to gain such as better promotion and all of these
other things that eliminate the free rider prospect?

MR. MCGOWAN:

1

For at least two reasons, Your Honor.

2

The first reason being, as Justice Powell recognized in the

3

Sylvania opinion, it may facilitate cartelizing, cartelization

4

of the industry.

5

that Sharp's motive in imposing resale price restrictions on

6

its dealers was pursuant to a promise that it made to its

7

competitors not to enter into a meaningless price cutting war.

8

Sharp would serve as an example for the industry.

9

reason.

For example, we have evidence in this case

That's one

The second reason, and I think a more obvious reason,

10
11

is that rigorous price competition at the retail level is

12

eventually going to put back pressure on the manufacturer's

3

wholesale prices.

4

watch retail prices continue to go down without eventually

5

lowering his own prices.
QUESTION:

6
7

The manufacturer cannot stand there and

I have the impression you expected that

question.

8

MR. MCGOWAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

9

Now, the Court below said that there was no price

20

fixing here because Hartwell remained free to charge any price

21

he wanted.

22

distinction.

23

dealer will use his freedom to do anything other than raise

24

prices or increase margins.

25

the agreement here was to eliminate price cutting.

Now, this theoretical freedom is an artificial
It's unrealistic to suppose that the remaining

I mean, after all, the purpose of

And focusing on the remaining dealer's supposed
11

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

freedom ignores the reality of the agreement.

It's purpose and

2

effect was to destroy Business Electronics' freedom to lower

3

prices.
The narrow definition of price fixing adopted by the

4
5

Court below not only runs against this Court's precedent and

6

logic, it also violates the antitrust policy laid down by

7

Congress.

8

response to the Justice Department's vertical restraints

9

guidelines.

The best proof of this can be seen in Congressional

In 1985, Congress passed legislation condemning

10

those guidelines as an effort to "dilute or trivialize" the per

11

se rule.

12

And Congress even condemned a statement in the

13

guidelines which comes very close to the holding in this case.

14

And I'll quote briefly.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MCGOWAN:

17
18

Petitioner's Brief.

"Whereas, such policy guidelines --

Where are you reading from, Mr. McGowan?
I'm reading now from page 37 of the

The quote at the bottom.

"Whereas such policy guidelines are inconsistent with

19

established antitrust law as reflected in Supreme Court

20

decisions and statements of Congressional intent in stating

21

that vertical restraints that have an impact upon prices that

22

are subject to the per se rule of illegality only if there is

23

an explicit agreement as to specific prices."

24
25

That was one of the things that they specifically
condemned in the Justice Department's guidelines.
QUESTION:

This was a sense of Congress resolution?
12

Heritage

1

3

MR. MCGOWAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And it was actually-

passed and signed by the President.
In addition, using its power over appropriations,

4

Congress even went so far as to prohibit the Justice Department

5

from attempting to alter or amend the per se rule, again

6

demonstrating Congressional belief that the per se rule should

7

be broadly applied in the area of vertical price fixing.

8

9

QUESTION:

Just what weight ought this Court to give,

I mean, this isn't the Congress that enacted the Sherman Act,

10

or enacted the Clayton Act or any of the basic Acts upon which,

11

you know, the various per se rules have been based.

12

MR. MCGOWAN:

Your Honor, in Sylvania in

13

distinguishing price from non-price restraints, and in

14

reaffirming the application of the per se rule to price

15

restraints, Justice Powell took pains to note that among other

16

things, Congress had expressly approved the per se rule

17

repeatedly over the years.

18

Congressional intent has occurred since 1975.

19

given great —

And most of that indication of

20

QUESTION:

21

resolutions such as this one?

22

So it should be

And was he referring to sense of Congress

MR. MCGOWAN:

He was referring to repeal of the

23

Miller-Tydings Act, he was referring to Congress as in the

24

Square D case, Congress having enacted legislation in the

25

antitrust field without being aware of the per se rule, without
altering the per se rule, for example.

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

There should be no fear here that reversal of the

2

Fifth Circuit's narrow definition of price fixing would erode

3

the Sylvania decision.

4

restraints usually reduce both interbrand and intrabrand price

5

competition, that price restraints facilitate cartelizing and

6

that Congress approved the per se rule.

7

The Court made clear there that price

We are not dealing here, as Sharp contends, with a

8

mere exclusive distributorship.

This is not a mere agreement

9

to terminate a dealer who happened to be a discounter.

An

10

exclusive distributorship is defined as an agreement between a

11

supplier and a distributor, whereby the supplier agrees not to

12

appoint any other dealer in a defined territory.

13

a non-price restraint, it says nothing about pricing.

14

It's clearly

Here, we have a conspiracy aimed specifically at

15

ending price cutting by a dealer, by the only means left

16

available to those who wanted higher prices, and that is

17

termination of the price cutter.

18

to look at effect.

19

exclusive distributorship or the agreement at issue here.

20

Sharp says, well, you've got

The effect is the same whether you have an

But a bona fide exclusive distributorship may or may

21

not have an adverse effect on interbrand competition.

For

22

example, if Sharp had appointed Business Electronics as its

23

exclusive distributor, a price cutter would have remained in

24

the market and would have represented price competition viz a

25

viz interbrand competition.

And even if an exclusive

distributorship had the same effect on competition as the
14

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

agreement here, the availability of lawful means to achieve the

2

same result, the same anticompetitive result, does not excuse

3

the use of conspiracies to eliminate price cutters and unlawful

4

means.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. McGowan, what do you expect a

6

manufacturer to do when he's confronted with this situation.

7

One of his distributors comes and says, look, I'm a full

8

service distributor, I do a lot of advertising.

9

this is true.

Let's assume

I know you say, this is not the situation here.

But let's assume one distributor whose a good guy, he has a

MR. MCGOWAN:

QUESTION:

1

Mr. McGowan, is there any evidence in

2

this case that the manufacturer, Sharp, did request your client

3

to add additional salesmen or additional services or anything

4

else as a condition of retaining his dealership?
MR. MCGOWAN:

5

There is no evidence that they

6

complained to him about failure to provide requisite number of

7

services.

8

Hartwell was appointed as a dealer, and didn't have as many

9

salesmen as Hartwell.

My client did lose a number of salesmen well before

And there are memos in the file saying,

10

he's working to build back up his sales force.

But there's no

11

evidence that they ever came to my client and said, if you

12

don't have more salesmen, we're going to terminate you.

Or if

3

you don't provide more advertising, we're going to terminate

4

you.
There's not a shred of evidence to support the notion

5
6

that Sharp cared about the level of advertising.
QUESTION:

7

Is the dealership agreement in the record?

8

Are there conditions like that in the standard -- do they use a

9

standard agreement, the same agreement with both of the two

20

dealers?
MR. MCGOWAN:

21

There is no dealership agreement in the

22

record for Hartwell, I don't believe, and I don't think there's

23

a dealership agreement in the record for Business Electronics,

24

either.

25

It's irrelevant to the case.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Tyler.

16

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD R. TYLER, JR., ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TYLER:

18
19
20

Thank you, Mr. McGowan.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
I think listening to the argument of petitioner here,

21

it is well for us to make very clear at the outset that Sharp

22

is not contending that terminating a discounting dealer, such

23

as has occurred here in June of '73, is always permissible.

24

What we're arguing is that such a decision to terminate a

25

dealer is not necessarily legal, that is to say, it is not per
se legal, and should be open to inquiry in the courts as to
22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

just what were the circumstances that led to that termination.

2

What was going on in the marketplace.

3

functions, etcetera, that the various dealers hired in the

4

marketing system of the manufacturer and supplier, were doing

5

best so as to be as competitive as possible in the interbrand

6

marketplace.

7

What services,

In other words, we're arguing that this Court and the

8

lower courts should not presume conclusively that terminating

9

dealers is always anticompetitive.

In many instances, as this

10

Court has already recognized in Sylvania and Monsanto, there

11

can be circumstances where this kind of termination for price

12

cutting is not anticompetitive but procompetitive, particularly

13

when you measure what is going on not only interbrand but

14

intrabrand.

15

Now, let me suggest that one of the difficulties with

16

the rule apparently argued for by petitioner is that without

17

really doing anymore than using the phraseology, the petitioner

18

seems to assume that terminating a discounter is so obviously

19

and exclusively and constantly pernicious that it can be

20

assumed in each case to be anticompetitive.

I'm adverting to here is

that once Hartwell was the surviving dealer, he became an

exclusive dealer in the Houston area.
The Courts say you can do this.

I would argue that

once you say, hey, fellow, you're an exclusive in Houston,

14

that's a lot more devastating and stark to any discounter who

The other thing is the argument, apparently, as I

eliminate intra-brand competition are permissible.

1

Let me make one other point, and that is this:

one

2

of the curious things about petitioner's argument here is that

3

normally it would seem from an economic and practical point of

4

view that if I were a supplier of a calculator and I liked to

5

sell calculators particularly in a big city like Houston, and

6

if as I think the marketplace truly was in the early 70s, you

7

know, calculators were still coming along and weren't quite as

8

popular as they are today, but very competitive.

9

really hesitate to think that any sensible supplier would just

I would

10

say willy nilly, okay, other dealer, you come in and say, I get

rid of the price cutter.

12

I want to think about that a bit.

Why should I throw

13

out the fellow who might sell the most calculators in Houston

14

unless there were powerful reasons in terms of what I was

15

trying to achieve across the board that I'd want somebody that

16

doesn't discount as much.

12

the one the Bloomingdales in the pattern, and that

You suggest there's no distinction between

MR. TYLER:

It is a lot of nonsense in this sense.

No, no.
Which is exactly what the Judge, that was

what the Judge asked the jury to decide.

7

MR. TYLER:

The trouble with this is, once you've

8

used labels like, conspiracy and agreement, they can be

9

freighted with more meaning than the law or common sense should

10

allow.

QUESTION:

12

MR. TYLER:

Congress picked the words.
I don't mind saying to you, Justice

13

Stevens, that there was an agreement in a sense here.

What

14

else could there be?

been mumbling and fumbling around and complaining for some

16

time, Sharp had been saying, oh, no, no, we can't do this, we

17

can't terminate these guys.

18

It's either us or them.

In runs Hartwell, who by the way, had

Finally, there's an ultimatum.

The decision is made, them.

You can call that agreement, but that's not an

20

agreement which is rendered illegal by Section 1 standing

alone.

that hey, we deserve a medal, we are seeking from you, Justice

23

Stevens, a ruling that once this kind of thing happens, it is

24

deemed legal, per se.

25

that what happened here is illegal per se without more.

That's our point.

QUESTION:

You see, we're not in here arguing

We're saying that they shouldn't argue

Because it's settled as a matter of jury

MR. TYLER:

I don't think there's any real difference

between us.

20

you and Justice Scalia are posing, the real point is here there

would have to be some proof that -- and the petitioner here,

the terminated dealer, I assume would bear the burden of proof

-- to show that the agreement was not just to terminate, but

there had to be more, as you say.

A good illustration is in this --

QUESTION:

You've been telling us that that can

exist.

I mean, part of your earlier presentation was look, if

a manufacturer wants to go with a person whose going to charge

a higher price and have a more guality product and more

services and what not, he ought to be able to do it.

7

you're telling me he really can't be sure that he's getting

somebody whose going to charge the higher price.
MR. TYLER:

9

QUESTION:

10

But now

No, no.
It can't even be part of his understanding

11

that the non-terminated dealer will at least charge more than

12

the discounter was charging.

MR. TYLER:

before, I missed it.

That can't even be part of it.

Well, I'm sorry.

If you put it that way

This is a fast ball and not just an

What you're saying now is quite

Let me repeat.

What Judge Clark and the Court below

19

tried to say is all we're trying to say.

There has to be some

20

proof that once the terminated dealer is told be gone, because

21

you discounted and you did this and you didn't do that, then

22

the law permits this so long as the discounted dealer whose

23

terminated can't come in and show that there was truly a

24

conspiracy in addition, or an agreement to pick up on the

25

colloquy between me and Justice Stevens, what you will maybe an

2

law doesn't permit.

3

QUESTION:

Let me be clear what your position is.

4

You say it would be enough the Judge could instruct the jury,

5

it is enough, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find

6

that when Sharp terminated B.E., it was the understanding

7

between Sharp and Hartwell that Hartwell whatever other prices

8

he might charge, would at least not charge prices as low as

9

B.E.?
If you find that there was even that minimal

10
11

understanding regarding price, then you can find for the

12

plaintiff.

13

MR. TYLER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Now, that raises another problem.
Well, is that the instruction you want, or

isn't it?
MR. TYLER:

No.

I would like to be free, I would

17

like I say, Sharp would like to be free of this kind of

18

instruction.

QUESTION:

Is the minimal assurance that I just gave

you, would that be enough?

The only thing I ask from you

Hartwell, is that you not charge prices as low as B.E.

QUESTION:

10
11

Well, —
You can answer that question, yes, or no,

can't you, Mr. Tyler.
MR. TYLER:

If you're asking the point or raising the

12

point again which we don't like, let me take it this way.

13

would say to you that it should not be sufficient, as the Court

14

of Appeals apparently thinks would be, although it's unclear,

15

to simply go in and among other things, have the charger of the

16

rules of law applicable to this to say look, the mere fact that

17

everybody seems to agree that, a) there was a termination of

18

discounter, and a remaining dealer who picks up his work, that

19

may be enough, jury, for you to infer an illegal agreement to

20

maintain retail prices at some level.

between Sharp and Hartwell that Hartwell would not charge

under the antitrust laws?

4

Would you accept that instruction?

MR. TYLER:

I'd prefer to phrase it a little better,

if I may say so, but I'll accept it.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Tyler.

MR. MCGOWAN:

I think we first of all need to be

15

clear on the full instructions given by Judge Seals below.

If

16

you read the instructions in their entirety, he made it clear

17

to the jury that the jury had to find a conspiracy to eliminate

18

price cutting.

19

where the Judge said, "Sharp, on the other hand, contends that

20

it terminated Business Electronics unilaterally, not as a

21

result of any agreement or understanding with Hartwell, but

22

because of Business Electronics' sales performance.

23

find that Sharp did not terminate Business Electronics pursuant

24

to an agreement or understanding with Hartwell to eliminate

25

price cutting by business electronics, then you should answer,

And I'm quoting now from Joint Appendix 19,

no, to question number one."

Mr. McGowan, can I ask you the question

Justice Scalia and I were asking your opponent.

How do you

interpret Judge Clark's opinion?

11

have to prove merely that there was some restraint, as I

I can agree with you that I'm getting rid of this

2

discounter, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm not

3

going to allow you to charge as low prices, if in the course of

4

your business, you find you can charge that low a price and

5

still make a good business for yourself.

6

you might be able to find that.

7

MR. MCGOWAN:

Maybe ten years hence

But if the jury is instructed that in

8

order to find a conspiracy, they have to find a mutual purpose

9

to achieve an unlawful objective, and the jury finds that there

10

was a mutual purpose, a conspiracy to eliminate price cutting,

11

that is a purpose shared by both the supplier and the dealer,

12

and the evidence supports that finding, then it has to be a

13

form of vertical price fixing.

14

there's no reason to have that purpose other than to eliminate

price cutting.
