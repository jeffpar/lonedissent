Ms. Hair, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PENDA D. HAIR, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. HAIR:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
We seek reversal of two rulings concerning the scope

11

and application of Title 42 United States Code Section 1981.

12

Section 1981 guarantees to all persons within the jurisdiction

13

of the United States the same right to make and enforce

14

contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.

15

The first issue presented is whether an employer that

16

intentionally subjects a black worker on account of her race to

17

onerous and discriminatory terms and conditions of employment

18

violates Section 1981.

19

The second issue is whether a black employee who

20

establishes that she was denied a promotion because of her race

21

must additionally affirmatively prove that she was more

22

qualified than the white worker who received the promotion in

23

order to hold her employer liable for promotion discrimination

24

under Section 1981.

25

In this case, unlike many cases of employment

discrimination, the plaintiff presented extensive direct

2

evidence that her employer engaged in blatant intentional

3

discrimination on the basis of race.

4

evidence, the President and General Manager of McLean Credit

5

workers.

7

worker because they cause problems.

8

According to the

And he stated that he did not want to hire a black

And there were numerous instances of racial remarks

9

and race-based conduct that were introduced into the record

10

including an admission by one of the Company witnesses that

11

policy of the President was not to hire black workers.

12

Brenda Patterson was at first the only black worker

13

at McLean Credit Union and later one of only two black workers

14

and she was the victim of racial discrimination during her ten

15

years of employment under the management of the president and

16

general manager, Robert Stevenson.

17

charging the credit union with intentional discrimination in

18

the terms and conditions of her employment and with promotion

19

discrimination.

Patterson filed suit

20

The District Court dismissed the claim of

21

discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment, and

22

the Court of Appeals affirmed.

23

that Section 1981 prohibits discrimination only with respect to

24

hiring, firing and promotion.

25

District Court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had the

Heritage

The Fourth Circuit concluded

On the promotion claim, the

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

burden of proving both that she was denied the promotion

2

because of her race, and that she was more qualified than the

3

white employee who received the promotion.

4
5

And the Court of Appeals affirmed this jury
instruction.

6

With regard to the scope of Section 1981, under the

7

rule of law adopted by the Fourth Circuit, protection under

8

Section 1981 is afforded only against refusals to enter into a

9

contract or continue in a contractual relationship.

Under that

10

rule of law, a black worker can get a job but the black worker

11

can be forced to pay a very high price for that job in loss of

12

dignity.

13

The employer can say to that worker, we'll hire you

14

but only if you submit to conditions of employment in which you

15

are humiliated and demeaned because of your race.

16

It is our position that that type of condition of

17

employment is exactly the badge of inferiority that the

18

Thirteenth Amendment and Section 1981 were designed to

19

prohibit.

20

to pay the price of stigma and humiliation in order to be able

21

to perform the contract that she has a right to enter into has

22

not been afforded the same right to make and enforce a

23

contract.

25

It seems obvious that a black worker who is forced

The black worker's exercise of her right to make and
enforce a contract has been burdened because of her race.

QUESTION:

1

Well, I don't think that's crystal clear

2

Ms. Hair, that the consequences like you're talking about, bad

3

as they may be, necessarily implicate the right to make or

4

enforce a contract.

5

MS. HAIR:

That certainly isn't an inclusive term.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would submit that

6

the right to make and enforce a contract has to include the

7

right to perform that contract free from racial discrimination.

8

If the right to make and enforce a contract is going to have

9

any meaning, it must include the right not to be burdened in

10

the exercise of your right to make and enforce a contract -QUESTION:

11

And so you suggest then that there could

12

have been a suit by the employee in a State court to enforce

13

the employment contract and get an injunction against this sort

14

of harassment based on the contract?
MS. HAIR:

15
16
17
18

No, Justice White.

That is not my

position.
My position is that it doesn't matter whether the
employee, the worker who is racially harassed --

19

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that suit would fail?

20

MS. HAIR:

In North Carolina, I believe that Mrs.

21

Patterson would not have been able to stop the harassment in

22

State Court under State contract law.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Because it was not a provision of the

contract, I take it?
MS. HAIR:

That's right.

Because she was an at-will

She could be terminated under North Carolina law for

2

any reason whatsoever including the bad faith reason.
QUESTION:

3

Well, now that would be a problem with

both whites and blacks, I suppose.

5

protected against racial harassment based on the contract, why

is 1981 violated?

employer hires a black person for $50,000 and the black person

later comes in and says, well, if I'd been white, they would

23

have paid me $55,000, so they violated 1981.

under 1981?

It's

intentional racial discrimination in pay.
QUESTION:

3
4

Yes, I do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

So 1981 really covers everything that

Title VII does?
MS. HAIR:

5

Practically I think that's probably

6

correct because Section 1981 guarantees the same right to make

7

and enforce a contract.

8

exercise of that right is burdened by racial discrimination,

9

the same right has not been afforded.
QUESTION:

10
11

In this case is it discrimination in the

making of the contract that you're complaining about?
MS. HAIR:

12

13

And my position is that when the

I believe that it's discrimination in the

making of the contract and in the enforcing of the contract.

14

QUESTION:

In what respect?

15

MS. HAIR:

In the making of the contract because Mrs.

16

Patterson is an at-will employee under North Carolina law and

17

everyday that she goes to work, she makes a new contract.

18

in order to make that contract, she has to endure conditions of

19

employment that are not required of a white worker.

20

same as if the employer told her at the time that she showed up

21

to apply for a job, we won't give you a job unless you stand in

22

front of our factory for an hour holding a sign saying, I am

23

inferior.

It's the

I suppose you'd make the same

argument if that was a contract for six months, an employment

MS. HAIR:

I think ultimately it doesn't make any

difference.

7

contract so that she was not making a new contract everyday,

8

and I would still suggest that because her right to perform the

9

contract is burdened, that she does not have the same right to

10

make and enforce the contract as the white worker, because she

11

is being encouraged not to enforce her contract and receive the

12

benefits of her contract, but to cancel the contract.

13

what the racial discrimination in terms and conditions does.

14
15

In that case, if there were a fixed term of

That's

It encourages cancelling the contract and not
obtaining the benefits of the contract.

16

QUESTION:

Well,

I mean, that's a question of proof,

17

I would suppose, isn't it?

18

you had to prove that the racial discrimination was of such

19

force and effect as to make it impossible for her to perform

20

her job, thereby causing her to break the contract.
No.

I mean, you're not asserting that

21

MS. HAIR:

It is not our position that she must

22

prove constructive discharge.

23

conduct that's intentional and that's on the basis of race will

24

affect that employee as to whether they want to continue on the

25

job.

It's our position that any

It may not be so bad that they actually quit, but it

Heritage

9
Reporting Corporation

certainly is burdening the exercise of their right.
QUESTION:

2

What right?

It has to burden the right to

3

either make or enforce a contract, right?

4

enforce.

5

really accurate.

Either make or

Now, your example of the person with the sign is not
That isn't what happened here.

6

If you said, before I will give you a job, you must

7

stand outside in front for an hour with a sign that says, I'm

8

inferior, there you are burdening the making of a contract.

9

But what happens here is, you give the person the job and after

10

the job, you are making the person hold a sign that says, I am

11

inferior.

12

Now, if that is so burdensome as to cause the worker

13

to be unable to perform and therefore cause the worker to break

14

the contract, then you're interfering with the right to enforce

15

it, I suppose.

16

level, I don't see how it burdens her right to either make or

17

to enforce the contract.

18

But I don't see how, if it doesn't rise to that

MS. HAIR:

Well, with Mrs. Patterson, because she is

19

an at-will employee and she makes the contract every day, I

20

would contend that she is in exactly the same position as the

21

person who is told to hold the sign for an hour before they

22

will be hired.

23

But even assuming that we're dealing with a person

24

that had a fixed contract, because it has the impact on that

25

person of treating them differently and discouraging them,

making them think about whether they want to continue, it

2

doesn't actually have to cause them to quit the job.

discourages them in enforcing the contract and therefore they

4

have not been afforded the same right to enforce their

contract.

It's just a violation of the same right to
She has not been afforded the same right

10

to carry out that contract, enforce the contract, and enjoy the

benefits of that contract as the white worker.

12

QUESTION:

Ms. Hair, I take it the Solicitor General

13

supports reversal here, but makes an effort to link the theory

14

to the language of Section 1981 in referring, as has been

15

suggested by other Justices this morning, the the making and

16

enforcement.

17

And as I understand it, the SG would say if there's

18

an implied covenant under State law of good faith and fair

19

dealing, that can be relied upon to show that somehow she was

20

prevented or hindered in her performance under the contract,

21

that that would support reversal.

22

MS. HAIR:

The Solicitor General, as I understand his

23

position, comes to the conclusion, as does the Fourth Circuit,

24

that Section 1981 directly protects only the right to enter

25

into a contract, regardless of the conditions of employment

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

after the contract.

2

QUESTION:

Well, I didn't understand it that way,

3

since they refer and rely on the implied obligation of good

4

faith and fair dealing in the enforcement of it.

5

MS. HAIR:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

When I said,

6

directly, I meant without looking at State law.

7

General then says, we can look at State law and if State law

8

gives a breach of contract remedy to a person like Mrs.

9

Patterson, that would be read into and enforceable --

The Solicitor

10

QUESTION:

And express or implied.

11

MS. HAIR:

Express or implied, that would be read

12

into and enforceable under Section 1981.

13

the Solicitor General focuses on the wrong issue.

14

agree that it's appropriate to look to common law to decide

15

what is a contract.

16

protects the same right to make and enforce a contract.

17

the Solicitor General, by limiting that right only to terms

18

that are read into the contract under State law, does not give

19

effect to the Federal principle of equality that's set out in

20

that language, same right to make enforce.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

AGain,

I believe that
I would

But we have a Federal statute that
And

Well, it does see, though, to at least

address itself more to the context and language of the Statute.
MS. HAIR:

Well, when you say the context of the

24

Statute, what the Solicitor General's approach would do if it

25

had been accepted in 1866 is that it would have incorporated

12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

the black codes into the contracts of black workers.

2

is no indication that Congress when it was acting in 1866

3

wanted to limit the coverage of Section 1981 to what State law

4

provided.

5

Congress was expressly concerned with overruling the black

6

codes which limited and put onerous conditions on the black

7

worker's ability to enter into contracts.

In fact, the indication is to the contrary that

8

And if there's any doubt about --

9

QUESTION:

10
11

And there

I don't understand why that follows from

the Solicitor's position.
You were saying that if a State has a law that

12

impacts explicitly on racial minorities that this law can be

13

incorporated into the contract without violating 1981?

14

MS. HAIR:

What the Solicitor General said, as I

15

understand it, is that you look to State law to determine what

16

rights are protected under Section 1981.

17

that you look to Federal law.

18

an equality statute, and that Congress explicitly did not want

19

to look to State law when it enacted Section 1981; it wanted to

20

overturn the black codes.

21

QUESTION:

And my position is

That this is a Federal statute,

Well, there's a difference, isn't there,

22

between State laws that differentially impact on racial

23

minorities and those that are neutral.

24

faith is a neutral term.

25

MS. HAIR:

The covenant of good

That's true but there is absolutely no

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

indication that Congress wanted State law to govern the scope

2

of Section 1981.
And let me say with respect to the covenant of fair

3
4

dealing, that concept really doesn't provide any additional

5

protection beyond what the Fourth Circuit would have provided

6

in covering absolute refusals to enter into contracts.

7

in North Carolina, and in all but four States in the United

8

States, where there is at-will employment, the covenant of good

9

faith and fair dealing simply does not apply to the worker.

Because

10

The employer has the right to fire the worker, except

11

in four States, for any reason whatsoever, including bad faith,

12

and therefore that employer has the right to harass that worker

13

until she quits.

14

the Solicitor General's theory would apply is a situation where

15

the worker could quit and claim constructive discharge, but

16

does not quit, stays on the job and instead sues under Section

17

1981.

18
19
20

And the only possible situation under which

QUESTION:

That would be protected by Title VII,

wouldn't she?
MS. HAIR:

The worker would be protected by Title

21

VII, if Title VII covers her employer.

22

Johnson v. Railway Express made very clear that the fact that

23

Title VII provides a remedy does not mean that Congress wanted

24

to undo any of the remedies that were provided by earlier Civil

25

Rights Acts.

Heritage

But the Court in

14

(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

That's perfectly true but the fact that

2

Title VII covers a lot of this perhaps would suggest to us that

3

we not strain to develop an independent body of Federal

4

contract law governing the terms of contracts.

5

MS. HAIR:

I would suggest that it's not an

6

independent body of Federal contract law.

It's a Federal

7

equality law, a Federal antidiscrimination law, and in this

8

case, the type of conduct that Mrs. Patterson complains of,

9

while actionable under Title VII, Title VII would not provide

10

an adequate remedy because Title VII does not provide

11

compensatory damages or punitive damages.

12

employee quits her job, unless the conduct is so severe that

13

she quits her job, she's not going to have a significant back

14

pay claim because she's still on the job.

And unless the

Section 1981.

And the remedies that Congress wanted to make

QUESTION:

Ms. Hair, I don't see how you can run away

21

from State law and say it's just a matter of Federal law.

22

mean, you have a statute that says a black person shall have

equal right to make and enforce contracts.

saying that we're going to develop a Federal law of contracts,

Now, doesn't that put us right in the middle of

3
4

deciding what the State law is concerning contracts?
MS. HAIR:

5

I do not believe it does, Justice Scalia.

6

I believe that what the court is asked to do under Section 1981

7

in this situation, as in all other situations where it enforces

8

Section 1981, is to develop a Federal law of what constitutes

discrimination.

It's not discrimination in

It's discrimination in one field.

Now, don't you think that this has -- it either

14
15

refers to a Federal contract law or to State law of contracts.

16

And you think it's a Federal contract law that we have to

17

develop?
MS. HAIR:

18

No, I don't think that you have to develop

19

a Federal law that tells you what is in a contract.

20

position is that regardless of what is written in the contract,

21

what are the terms of the contract, if the plaintiff is

22

burdened in performing that contract because of her race, that

23

she has not been afforded the same right to make and enforce a

24

contract.

25

My

And I think the Court's cases make clear that Section

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1981 and the parallel provision, Section 1982, go beyond merely

2

guaranteeing an absolute right to enter into a contract.

3

In the case of Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven, under

4

Section 1982, the Court ruled in that case, and again, it did

5

not rest its decision on State property law.

6

involved the right to purchase and hold property under Section

7

1982, and the right to join a swimming pool association was not

8

a right that was protected under State law.

And furthermore, the right to

swimming pool association and the membership in the swimming

pool association could not be conveyed along with the ownership

16

of the house.

17

membership in the swimming pool association was a benefit that

18

became associated with home ownership because a third party

voluntarily made it available to persons in the area, and that

the persons who were making it available could not make it

jury instruction.
In this case, Mrs. Patterson was required to prove

13
14

both that she was denied a promotion on account of race and

15

that she was more qualified.

16

The question is whether she was denied the promotion on the

17

basis of race.

And that simply is not the law.

There are a number of circumstances in which a person

19

can be denied a promotion on the basis of race, without

20

necessarily being more qualified than the person who received

the job.

The most obvious example is where the two candidates

MS. HAIR:

I think that there was certainly

conclude, if properly instructed, that the decision was made on

the basis of race.
If there are no further questions, I would reserve

This case presents the first opportunity that I'm

1
2

aware of for the Court to differentiate between the rights

3

available under Title VII as opposed to the rights available

4

under Section 1981.
The petitioner's case in the first instance is a case

adverse working conditions on several pieces of evidence of

cognizable claim under Section 1981.

obvious that the terms conditions and privileges of employment

language which is in Title VII would cover alleged racial

harassment, adverse working conditions.

I believe that it's

The language in Section 1981, however,is a different

18
19

kind of language. The language there is to make and enforce

20

contracts.

21

I hope that this Court will take the opportunity to define and

22

differentiate the various rights available under each of the

23

two statutes.

24
25

And I believe that they're two different things, so

Part of the problem in understanding what rights are
available in the statutes is the fact that many of the lower

courts have used the term, discrimination, synonymous with

various things.

QUESTION:

1

Well, is it your position that once the

2

contract is made, there is no conduct of the employer that's so

3

onerous that it's not actionable under 1981 if it's racially

4

motivated?
MR. DAVIS:

5

I think any conduct of the employer which

6

is racially motivated which impacts on the right to make and

7

enforce contracts is actionable.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, assume that a contract is made in

good faith and in non-discriminatory terms, but once its

10

performance begins, highly onerous conditions are imposed.

there no conditions that are so onerous that 1981 would not be

QUESTION:

Yes, there are.
If the employment contract becomes

frustrated of its purpose by reason of racial discrimination,
is 1981 applicable?
MR. DAVIS:

I don't think a constructive discharge

case is actionable, if that's what you're getting to.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS::

Why?
Excuse me.

A constructive discharge case

would be actionable if the employee terminated.
QUESTION:

Because that is the denial of the right to

make a contract or to enforce it?
MR. DAVIS:

Enforce the contract, because the level

of opprobrious conduct became so great, if the evidence
supports that, that the employee could no longer continue the
employment.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Davis, what about the SG's

argument that if under State law, there's an implied obligation
or duty of good faith and fair dealing that 1981 can be
implemented?
MR. DAVIS;:

If that is correct and if that is true,

then I believe that an employee would have a cause of action in
State court
QUESTION:

Well, this case wasn't analyzed on that

theory so presumably it would be appropriate then to send it
back and let the Court make that kind of analysis if we agreed

with the SG?

MR. DAVIS:

There was no claim for relief.

There was

QUESTION:

5

I think that your colleague on the other

6

side indicated there would be no cause of action under North

7

MR. DAVIS:

8

9

Well, I think there is a cause of action

for a breach of the contract of fair dealing.

Now, whether

10

such a case has been found cognizable for racial conduct, for

11

hostile working environment of racial conduct, I don't know of

12

any North Carolina case that would uphold that.

13

no reason why they shouldn't if it in fact meets the elements

of that cause of action under North Carolina law.
QUESTION:

interpret enforce as covering the situation where a contract is

question.
QUESTION:

Do you interpret, enforce, in the statute

to cover a situation where there is a frustration of the

contract's purpose by reason of racial animus?

MR. DAVIS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

taking it to Court but how else do you enforce a contract?

is the competence and the capacity to take your case to Court.

this Court, rather than to adopt lower court cases.

2

MR. DAVIS:

Yes, sir.

3

I believe that Section 1981 primarily grants

4

competence and capacity to make and enforce the contracts.

5

Title VII grants a cause of action for racial harassment, for

hostile working environment, and it is under that Section that

7

this plaintiff, this petitioner could have brought her claim.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, I suppose you would agree that if an

employer puts a condition- on contracting with a black that he

10

doesn't insist on with a white, that there's a 1981 cause of

11

action?

12

MR. DAVIS:

13

QUESTION:

If he puts a condition -I will, sure, I'll hire you if so and so.

14

And it's a condition that he just doesn't insist on with

whites.

I think that's in the making of the

MR. DAVIS:

If there are no other questions with regard to the

11
12

harassment claim, I'd like to go into the promotion claim

13

briefly.

14

The petitioner has written a magnificent brief

15

concerning all of the ways that you can support your claim for

16

punishing discrimination, none of which are applicable to this

17

case.

18

three years ago, this Company gave a promotion to somebody else

19

who was working in an entirely different job responsibility,

20

had entirely different functions and you promoted her from

21

account junior to account intermediate.

22

that job.

23

In this case, the petitioner came into Court and said

And I should have had

Faced with that evidence, the articulated reason for

24

giving that promotion was well, this lady's been performing her

gave her a pay increase.
Under the McDonnell-Douglas proof scheme, after the

5

that was our responsibility, that was our burden of persuasion.

6

The petitioner —
QUESTION:

7
8
9

You're arguing now about the instruction,

right?
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, sir. And the correct law with regard

10

to the burden or the burden of proof of the petitioner after we

11

have articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for our decision,

12

our nondiscriminatory reason being, number one, the petitioner

13

was not qualified for this job.

14

This was an accountant bookkeeper position.

15

QUESTION:

She was a clerk, a file clerk.

Well, what if your client, the Credit

16

Union, promoted exclusively by seniority and wasn't

17

particularly interested in qualifications, just whoever had

18

been in line longest would be enabled to have the promotion.

19

Now, an instruction like this wouldn't be warranted in that

20

case, would it?

21

MR. DAVIS:

No, sir, I don't think it would.

But

22

there's absolutely no evidence that seniority, education or any

23

other thing was a criteria in this particular promotion.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, was it conceded by the petitioner in

this case that qualification or performance was the only

whatsoever.
After the respondent, the credit union, had

11
12

articulated this nondiscriminatory reason for their decision,

13

that is, the qualifications of the lady doing the job, the

14

petitioner offered no further evidence, but simply relied on

15

these various allegations of this ten year course of conduct of

hostile working conditions to say that the decision by the

QUESTION:

3

MR. DAVIS:

I know, but what was the instruction on?
The instruction was that in order for the

petitioner to prevail, she must show that she was more

5

qualified than the lady who received the promotion.
QUESTION:

6
7

she wasn't qualified for the job.
MR. DAVIS:

8
9
10

But the reason the employer gave was that

In the first instance, she wasn't

qualified and in the second instance, her qualifications did
not meet the qualifications of the lady who had the job.
QUESTION:

11

Well, and so you think that the

12

instruction was nevertheless proper that she had to prove she

13

was more qualified?
MR. DAVIS:

14

After we had met our burden of persuasion

15

of showing that relative qualifications were the reason for our

16

decision, I believe under Burdine, if we have the right to

17

choose between equally qualified candidates, then it then is

18

her burden to show that she is more qualified.
QUESTION:

19

Yes, but may I ask, do you think you have

20

the right to choose between equally qualified candidates on the

21

basis of race?

22

MR. DAVIS:

The right to choose between equally

23

qualified candidates absent any evidence of any other illegal

24

motive.

QUESTION:

That's one of four factors.

The third

factor was also that she was more qualified.
MR. DAVIS:

And the reason for that is because the

evidence which we presented in rebuttal of the prima facie case
was that qualifications were the reason, and the petitioner
offered no evidence to rebut that to show that, no, the
decision was based on race.
QUESTION:

But the lack of evidence, it seems to me

is a reason for never sending the case to the jury, not a
reason for sending it to the jury with the wrong instruction.
It may well be that there was no evidence that the two of them
had equal qualifications and race was the reason for choosing
between two people with equal qualifications.
But in that case, the remedy was that it should never
have been sent to the jury, and you should have appealed on
that ground if the jury verdict wasn't set aside.

But you're

You're asking for the giving of erroneous

instruction, instead.
MR. DAVIS:

I agree this case should never have gone

to the jury on that issue.

It went to the jury, I think, under

the facts of this case where the only evidence for the decision
was promotion.
QUESTION:

But that's what your brief boils down to.

You say, there wasn't evidence.

That may well be, but that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PENDA D. HAIR, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

17

MS. HAIR:

May it please the Court.

18

In my initial argument, I did not reach the

19

legislative history of Section 1981.

20

about the language of the Statute, the legislative history

21

makes it overwhelmingly clear that what Congress was concerned

22

about was onerous treatment, onerous conditions of employment

23

that former slave owners were putting on former slaves and

24

other black workers including whipping them, stopping talking

25

on the job, all the way from things that might be considered

Heritage

If there's any doubt

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

miner such as talking on the job to whipping, were the types of

2

treatment that Congress was concerned about.

3

With regard to your question, Justice Scalia, about

4

whether Section 1981 guarantees an equal right to perform a

5

contract, I believed that the Court reached that conclusion in

6

footnote 78 of the Jones v. Mayer, although Jones was a Section

7

1982 case, footnote 78 discussed Section 1981, and it held

8

where a group of whites terrorized blacks in order to stop them

9

from performing their contract, that those whites had violated

10

the rights of blacks under Section 1981 to dispose of their

11

labor by contract.

12

With regard to the jury instruction, this is not a

13

case where

there were no facts to support the conclusion that

14

the reason

given was a sham and that the real reason was racial

15

discrimination.

16

Justice Marshall referred to two racial statements. I

17

counted nine different racial statements made by the President

18

of the company.

19

And Justice Scalia, you asked whether Mrs. Patterson

20

complained

21

another employee did complain about the statements and not only

22

statements, he complained about discrimination and refusal to

23

hire a black computer operator.

24
25

about those statements.

The record shows that

And that employee was fired.

The District Court found that there was sufficient
evidence to submit the promotion claim to the jury and

Heritage

41
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

particularly the District Court relied on the fact that Mrs.

2

Patterson introduced evidence to suggest that Susan Williamson

3

was trained for the job for a period of time before she was

4

actually promoted, and she was put into training for that job

5

at a time when she had failed in her training for a computer

6

operator job, and was brought back over, put into a new job.

7

There was a vacancy that somebody else was filling, and then

8

after she received the training, she was actually promoted into

9

that job.
And given the direct evidence in this case, given the

10

11

evidence of training, it's simply not true that the jury

12

instruction was harmless, which is essentially what Mr. Davis'

13

argument boils down to.
If there are no further questions, I have nothing

14
15

further.

16

Thank you very much.
