CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

No. 86-714, Rodney P. Westfall versus William T. Erwin.
Mr. Ayer, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. AYER:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

10

The issue in this case is whether the Court of

11

Appeals erred in denying immunity to three supervisors at a

12

military supply depot in a negligence action against them for

13

employment-related injuries suffered to an employee at the

14

depot.

15

There is substantial agreement, as indicated in the

16

briefs, among the parties concerning a number of points.

17

the parties agree that there is a thing called absolute

18

immunity that exists under the Federal common law and does

19

protect a significant category of Federal activities, that is,

20

the activities of Federal employees against personal liability

21

of those employees from State tort law actions.

22

QUESTION:

First

This is the Barr against Matteo and Howard

23

against Lyons line of cases?

24

MR. AYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayer, what's the source of that

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

immunity do you suppose?
»

2
3

5

6

MR. AYER:

Apart from this Court's cases, you mean,

going back?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you detect any source for finding

that immunity?
MR. AYER:

Well, the source, I think, is the priority

7

of protecting the ability of the Federal government to function

8

and perform the duties and tasks that it has ultimately under

9

the Constitution.

I think one could ask the question, is it a

10

matter of supremacy and are we invoking the supremacy clause.

11

And I would say I guess my answer to that would be, sort of.

12

And I'll explain that by saying that technically in

13

this case we are talking about an application of State law that

14

has been made applicable in the context of exclusive

15

jurisdiction Federal enclaves as a matter of Congressional

16

action, a blanket enactment of State law.

17

But the concern remains very real.

So that the "sort

18

of" is explained by the fact that there is not a technical

19

conflict that does not involve an act of Congress triggering

20

the application of State law.

21

between the application of evolving State tort law concepts and

22

the priority of the Federal government being able to perform

23

its functions through its employees.

24
25

QUESTION:
though, right.

There is nonetheless the tension

This is not a constitutional principle,

I mean, Congress could I presume pass a statute

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

5

1

saying there is no immunity whatever for Federal?

2

MR. AYER:

That is certainly true, yes.

3

QUESTION:

So it's sort of like a negative commerce

4

clause kind of?
MR. AYER:

5

Well, I think what we're talking about is

6

maybe a sort of an assumption or a presumption that it is

7

intended that the Federal government be able, intended in the

8

Constitution, absent some action by Congress indicating

9

otherwise, that it be able to go forward with its activities as

10

authorized by Congress, and the disruption that would result by

11

the regular interaction of State law principles interfering

12

with the performance of those functions I think is what it's

13

designed to protect.

14

intend to have these Federal authorizations override State law.
QUESTION:

15
16

Congress could of course say we do not

So you are proposing a sort of dormant

commerce clause analysis in effect?

17

MR. AYER:

I think that's correct, Justice O'Connor.

18

QUESTION:

Our cases have never discussed the theory,

19

have they?

20

liable?

In fact, the Barr case arose out of what was it, a

21

MR. AYER:

That's right.

22

QUESTION:

Action and was discussed in terms of

23
24
25

privilege, not immunity at all.
MR. AYER:

Well, it was clearly discussed by

reference to the decision in Greqoire v. Biddle and the need to

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

6
1

protect the Federal functioning.

2

I think, that went well beyond the implications of the

3

defamation character of the action that was involved there.
QUESTION:

4
5

It was discussed in language,

Federal instrumentalities from State

taxes, what's the basis of that immunity?
MR. AYER:

6

It may well be somewhat analogous to this

7

situation.

8

pointed out, that Congress could override it if it chose to.

9

If it chose to define Federal priorities in a way that allowed

10

11

It's analogous in the sense, as Justice Scalia has

the State law to override, it certainly could do so.
But we're dealing with a situation here where there

12

has been no such overriding, and we're trying to focus on what

13

the proper rule ought to be in the situation where Congress

14

presumably intends to have its activities carried out in a way

15

that has evolved both under statutes and regulations.

16

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there some analogy here to

17

Clearfield Trust?

It seems to me there's as much analogy to

18

that kind of Federal common law as there is to the negative

19

commerce clause.

20

in checks, we need to know when these things or what rule

21

they're going to be governed by, they're in all fifty States,

22

so we don't follow the State rule in every single case.

23

a matter of necessarily some at least explicit Constitutional

24

doctrine, but just as I suppose you say, if Congress had

25

thought about it, or the Court will think about it for

Where in effect you know the Government deals

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

Not as

7

1

Congress, that's the sort of rule there ought to be.
MR. AYER:

2

I will agree with that as well, Your

3

Honor.

I mean, I would prefer to characterize it in the terms

4

that the Court has put it in, and that is, in terms of the need

5

to protect the functioning of the Federal government and to

6

analyze it that way.
And we think that when analyzed that way, there are a

7
8

number of policy considerations upon which the doctrine has

9

rested.

10

Before I get to that, I'd like to indicate precisely

11

what it is we are seeking to argue here today, and what we've

12

argued in our briefs.

13

employees are properly immune from State tort law actions for

14

all acts that they take within the scope of their employment,

15

our principal submission both in our briefs, and today is that

16

they are immune for that conduct within the outer perimeter at

17

least when they are in the exercise of some activity that does

18

involve a component of discretion.

Although we believe that Federal

19

That is, in the words of this Court's decision in

20

Davis v. Scherer, they exercise discretion whenever the law

21

"fails to specify the precise action that the official must

22

take in each instance."

23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ayer, if what we are trying to

24

do is to determine what Congress would do if it had thought

25

about it, should we analogize then to the Federal Tort Claims

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

8

1

Act for our guidance in determining discretionary acts for

2

which there might be immunity?

3

MR. AYER:

I think not, Justice O'Connor.

And

4

there's a couple of reasons for that.

One is that, maybe the

5

most practical, although I think not the most significant one,

6

is that the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Discretionary

7

Function exception of that Statute really doesn't provide us

8

with much of a practical solution when one goes to it and tries

9

to identify the precise level of discretion.

This Court's

10

decisions in Varig do indeed suggest that a fairly low level of

11

discretion should be the cut off under the Tort Claims Act at

12

least where you're dealing with regulatory sorts of activities.

13

But much beyond that there is, I think we have to

14

say, some significant amount of confusion as to exactly where

15

the line is drawn in various situations.

16

QUESTION:

But —

Well, nonetheless, that's a line Congress

17

has drawn, and wouldn't most Tort claimants be suing both the

18

employee and the Federal Government if they had a State tort

19

action, so you would be determining that question anyway,

20

wouldn't we?

21

MR. AYER:

Well, that's possible that they would be.

22

But I'd like to give the second reason, which is really the

23

primary reason why it's not an appropriate thing to do.

24

that is that the Tort Claims Act and personal immunity are

25

really dealing with very different things, and have very

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

And

9
1

different consequences.

The principle that the government will

2

be liable for its conduct and essentially that the burdens of

3

harm resulting from its conduct in certain defined situations

4

defined in the Statute, primarily defined to include sort of

5

run of the mill negligence in the performance of duties is a

6

principle that amounts to a reallocation of that burden.

7

not an action that will necessarily at all have the impact of

8

shaping the conduct of the Federal government.

9

government has to engage in many activities that will

It is

The Federal

10

unavoidably have some harmful affects, and the conclusion is

11

drawn as to at least some of those that the government should

12

nonetheless should pay for those things while going on doing

13

them in many instances.

14

With regard to personal liability, you're dealing

15

with a very different animal which will have very different

16

consequences.

17

clearly have a direct effect in shaping his or her conduct.

Imposing the liability on the individual will

QUESTION:

18

Mr. Ayer, is there anything in the Federal

19

Tort Claims Act that substitutes the liability of the United

20

States for the liability of the individual actor as a

21

defendant?

22

MR. AYER:

Yes, there is.

There are a couple of

23

answers to that, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

24

there is an award under the Federal Tort Claims Act, you may

25

not proceed further or proceed at all against an individual.

Heritage

Reporting

One is that when

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

10
1

And our understanding of that and our sense of what that meant

2

was that Congress wanted to be very careful to create a clear

3

line substituting liability once an action had been brought.

4

We do not read that at all as indicating its understanding that

5

individual employees would otherwise be liable.
The law at the time the Tort Claims Act was enacted

6

7

we are fra"nk to say was less than completely clear.

We think

8

that when one reads Spaulding v. Vilas, one comes up with a

9

principle of absolute immunity without regard to malice
applicable at least at the level of a sub-cabinet officer.

10

Barr v. Matteo was taken by this Court and was

11
12

decided on a vote of 4-1-4 with the one vote obviously going in

13

favor of the immunity but for reasons that didn't join in the

14

majority opinion because the law at that time was not a hundred

15

percent clear.

16

perfect sense for Congress to enact the provision that it did,

17

setting a bright line rule and a defense for an individual

18

should the government actually be held liable.
Now, there's two other examples, two other sets of

19
20

In that state of unclarity of the law, it made

'

statutes that are also I think responsive to Your Honor's

21

question.

22

other I think is known as the Rodriguez Act.

23

second one deals with the liability of doctors.

24
25

One of those is known as the Drivers' Act, and the
In any event, the

Taking the second one first, in the early 1970s,
there developed some case law including the District of

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

1

Columbia Circuit's decision in Henderson v. Bluemink finding

2

Federal doctors liable for their actions simply acting as

3

doctors.

4

applicable to various categories of Federal doctors, Congress

5

enacted legislation saying those doctors aren't liable,

6

substituting in essence the United States as a party.

And in response to that, in a rather direct response

They did not at that time take action with regard to

7
8

other categories of Federal employees.

We believe that they

9

didn't do that because they were acting directly in response to

10

a particular problem that had arisen.

11

arisen as to the other categories of employees at that time.
QUESTION:

12

The problem had not

Well, why doesn't the plaintiff in a case

13

like that just sue the United States under the Federal Tort

14

Claims Act?
MR. AYER:

15

In this case, they cannot sue the United

16

States because they have a remedy under the Federal Employees

17

Compensation Act.
QUESTION:

18

So it's like when you're covered by

19

Workmen's Compensation, a private employee, you try to find

20

some other person to sue so that you can get a tort recovery

21

rather than a Workmen's Compensation?

22

MR. AYER:

Well, I would think many plaintiffs do do

23

that.

And I also think it is noteworthy that under the laws of

24

many States, and I think it's actually a substantial majority

25

of States, it is not allowed to sue a co-employee, once you

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

12

have recovered a Worker's Compensation recovery.
The second statute, in answer to your question, is

2

the Drivers Act, which in 1961 —
QUESTION:

4

May I, before you leave the other?

Is it

5

therefore true that the Federal Employee Compensation Act omits

6

a provision that's found in many other compensation statutes,

7

and maybe that should be the remedy?
o

MR. AYER:

8
9

does not state whether or not an employee who recovers may sue

10

a co-employee.

11

silence.

12

The Federal Employees Compensation Act

And we think that that silence is just that,

QUESTION:

And most other compensation schemes do

13

have such an express provision, or has it been read into some

14

of those statutes?

15

What I'm really probing for, is it possible that one

16

could give you the relief you seek by saying that's how that

17

statute should have been interpreted if that's really what the

18

problem is?

19

MR. AYER:

Well, I think it is clearly not, and this

20

is something that we certainly looked into in preparing our

21

briefs in this case.

22

say, that's the way that statute should have been interpreted.

23

And the reason it's not is at the time the FECA statute was

24

enacted, the state of affairs in the States was not as I've

25

just described it.

I think it is certainly not that we can

I think it is now 47 States that have a

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13
1

provision in some form or other that more or less denies a co­

2

employee recovery once you have a Workers' Comp recovery.
QUESTION:

3

Why isn't it reasonable to assume that if

4

Congress promptly reacted to the medical malpractice situation

5

the way they did and also reacted to the drivers' liability the

6

way they did, seeing a problem there, that they would do

7

precisely the same thing here, if there's such a simple-

8

solution?

9
10

11

Who should do the lawmaking here at the bottom of
this case that we're all troubled by?
MR. AYER:

Well, I think there is a very good

12

argument to be made for the Court's continuing to do the

13

lawmaking which rests initially on the fact that the this Court

14

has been doing the lawmaking in this area for a very long time.

15

QUESTION:

And apparently, when they did the

16

lawmaking, the found a basis for liability against doctors and

17

a basis for liability who would — I mean, Congress would have

18

thought there would have been liability against drivers, why

19

not against people who store whatever this product was in a

20

negligent manner?

21

MR. AYER:

Well, as to the doctors, I think there is

22

serious doubt as to whether anybody thought that that was an

23

appropriate thing to have happen.

24
25

With regard to the drivers, I think indeed you can
make a reasonable argument that driving, that the rules of the

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

14

1

road that everybody has to obey including Federal mail delivery

2

people and other Federal employees.

3

set of rules or we're all going to be running into each other.

4

And the idea that a court would have concluded that Federal

5

employees must play by the same rules including the liability

6

rules is not surprising as to drivers.

7

Somebody's got to have a

I think it would be quite surprising with regard to

8

virtually every other category of Federal employee and Federal

9

activity that you can imagine.

10

QUESTION:

Well, supposing a maintenance worker on

11

this building, why should he be under different rules than

12

maintenance workers on a district building?

13

MR. AYER:

Well, two answers, I guess.

One is that I

14

think one has to look very carefully at the actual rules that

15

govern in a particular situation whether it be private or

16

whether it be a State employee.

17

situations you are dealing with a rule of immunity which is

18

somewhat less protective and they do vary all over the lot.

19

But you are also dealing with in almost every State, at least

20

the vast majority, an indemnification provision which

21

indemnifies for almost any liability that they might suffer.

22

QUESTION:

In most State governmental

No, I'm not thinking of it from the point

23

of view of the defendant, but the plaintiff.

24

make a difference whether a bucket of paint is dropped by a

25

worker on a public building or a private building?

Heritage

Reporting

Why should it

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

Anybody

15

1

should be careful with buckets of paint.
MR. AYER:

2

I think you have to look at the defendant

3

in order to answer that question.

And the answer is that the

4

United States Government is charged with the responsibility of

5

governing.

6

includes a whole range of activities.

7

for the United States Government to govern.

8

substantial burden and a substantial disruption of that ability

to be held liable when they take a step that involves any

11

judgment at all on their part and they may personally be held

the traffic rules.

17

that govern normal conduct that imposes risks?

18

MR. AYER:

I don't understand why that's different
You say the Federal employees have to obey
Why don't they have to obey other rules

I think the best answer to that is the

19

answer that was given both by Judge Learned Hand and by this

20

Court in Barr v. Matteo, which is that if we could know in

21

advance which individual government employees were acting

22

improperly before a suit was brought, and we could single them

23

out and say we're going to allow actions but only against the

24

bad guys, only against the ones that do something wrong because

25

we want those people to be accountable and we want them to stop

7

Stevens, I think is different because of the nature of the

8

rules and the relationship.

9

you're talking about people using the common roads.

10
11

12

QUESTION:

When you're talking about driving,

Negligent driving, there's a difference

between negligent driving and negligent workmanship?
MR. AYER:

I think there is.

I think the difference

13

is that the rules of the road must govern everyone or they

14

don't work.

15

or whatever it is I don't think you can say that about.

16

think you have a balance when you have the Federal Government

17

acting, you necessarily have a balance of that Federal

18

governmental function against the loss of a right of action of

19

an individual.

20

The rules of liability for dropping paint buckets
I

And the rule that's been laid down by this Court in

21

Barr v. Matteo and to a less explicit extent in the

22

Constitutional cases dealing with qualified immunity is a rule

23

that says there-'s a trade off and to this degree, we're going

24

to make it in favor of protecting the governmental functioning.

QUESTION:

When they're engaged in activities like

10

MR. AYER:

Well, because the reasons I would give you

are that it's going to inhibit in a general way and in a very

specific way, it's going to inhibit employees from wanting to

MR. AYER:

Heritage

(202)

21

1

Justice Brennan, is whether the policy and planning rule that

2

was enunciated by the Eleventh Circuit, not in this specific

3

case but in a later case as their Circuit's rule, whether that

4

is what should govern.

And it's our view very strongly —

5

QUESTION:

Their rule is a limiting rule?

6

MR. AYER:

Very limiting rule.

7

And we think that

there's two things wrong with it.

QUESTION:

They went to high policy makers did they?

MR. AYER:

They called it policy and planning.

10

QUESTION:

Policy and planning makers.

You would go

11

further and say any one who has discretion on how to do his

12

job?
MR. AYER:

13

I want to make two points about that:

14

number one, we do very strongly believe that an absolute

15

immunity is appropriate whenever a Federal employee acts within

16

the scope of his duty, within the outer perimeter of his

17

duties.

We are here in this case —

18

QUESTION:

Has that ever been held?

19

MR. AYER:

Well, I think that's a reasonable reading.

20

QUESTION:

Of what?

21

MR. AYER:

Of the Court's decisions in Barr and the

22

Court's decision in- Spalding.

23

QUESTION:

I don't think I thought so in Barr, did I?

24

MR. AYER:

I don't think you did.

25

QUESTION:

No.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

MR. AYER:

1

But in response to that, I'd just like to

2

say that there is a discussion in Barr in the plurality opinion

3

relating to the exercise of discretion.

4

discretion, if one reads it carefully I think is fairly

5

understood to define the outer limits, the outer perimeter of

6

authority and is not a requirement of discretion.

7

QUESTION:

That discussion of

Mr. Ayer, focusing on the facts of this

8

case, where is the discretion exercised, and what is it?

9

way the soda ash was piled?

10

MR. AYER:

The

Well, we are applying the discretion test

11

which is in footnote 14 of this Court's decision in Davis v.

12

Scherer that says that when a particular task is not

13

specifically defined, when it isn't prescribed what an employee

14

must do, he is exercising discretion, and the discretion that

15

is involved here is in the performance that three defendants

16

are supervisors at this Army depot, and they oversee the work

17

of the depot which includes the letting off of materiel, the

18

repackaging, the moving around and sending out of materiel, and

19

the storage.

20

QUESTION:

My next question is, aren't they going to

21

do exactly the same thing whether we have a rule of immunity or

22

not?

23

MR. AYER:

I think if we don't have a rule of

24

immunity there is a significant for any job that involves risks

25

that someone may be hurt and therefore may want to sue, we're

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23
1

creating a situation where the cost of doing that job increases

2

to the government, where individual employees if they have any

3

discretion are likely to shade that discretion and make

4

decisions in a way that is not necessarily in the interest of

5

the Federal Government.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Discretion here in the way the bags of

soda ash were piled?
MR. AYER:

In the way the work was done, in where

they were put when they were brought in, in who was assigned to

10

do it and whether safety equipment was used, if any was

11

necessary, in how the job was done.

12

are clearly discretionary decisions within the meaning of this

13

Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer.

14

QUESTION:

And we think that those

My only point is that the fact of

15

discretion as you have defined it is certainly going to be

16

carried out whether there is a rule of immunity or not, and

17

therefore one of the reasons for Barr v. Matteo is inapplicable

18

to the fact situation here.

19

MR. AYER:

I think there is a real question in any

20

case where there's any discretion how that discretion's going

21

to be exercised, and which way, how are we going to do the job.

22

And the question is whether we want that judgment to be shaded

23

by concern about liability.

If I may do so, I'd like to save the remainder of my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CLAY ALSPAUGH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

5
6

MR. ALSPAUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease

the Court.

7

The position of respondents here is simply that Barr

8

and its progeny set out applicable rules, we feel, to apply

9

immunity involving common law or State tort actions.

There is

10

a distinct difference between an activity that is within the

11

outer perimeters of a job of a government employee, and an

12

activity that is discretionary within that outer perimeter.

13

A question was put earlier as to whether or not that

14

outer perimeter in and of itself would establish liability and

were there any cases on that. Doe v. McMillan speaks directly

to that point.

on that very point.

15

QUESTION:

Well, how would the sufficiency of the

Federal Workers' Compensation provision preclude or not

QUESTION:

But I thought your argument was based on

2

the idea that here the workmen's compensation award was somehow

3

inadequate and if it had been more adequate, then perhaps the

4

suit against the co-employee would be barred.

5

there's much ground for making that distinction, is there?

6

MR. ALSPAUGH:

No, sir.

I don't think

I did not mean to imply

7

that. I'm saying that there would be some argument that there

8

was a justification for extending immunity in those

9

circumstances, though I do not think it is a valid argument.

For a Court extending immunity?

No, sir.

17

instance.

Primary example of that is the

And we submit that that would be the proper matter
and way in which to present and face this particular issue.
What is discretion?

Discretion I don't believe means

21

the right to make a decision one way or another necessarily.

22

Discretion is whether or not the act was a judgment or a

23

decision which it is necessary that the Government official be

24

able to make without fear of suit, that is, something that

25

effects governing, something that effects the extension of

Heritage

Corporation

27

governing, of policy making, not policy application.
The analogy that applies in this instance is the

2
3

FTCA.

Clearly State law applies in an instance that happens

4

within a State under the FTCA.

5

QUESTION:

I understand that.

We only want fearless

6

policy makers, we do not want fearless implementors of policy,

7

is that it?

8

MR. ALSPAUGH:

9

QUESTION:

No, sir.

We want to be sure we have really terrific

10

impartial Federal policies but we don't really care how they're

11

implemented, is that it?
MR. ALSPAUGH:

12

Yes, sir.

I think that there could be

13

and these cases hold generally that you have to look at each

nature of the policy involved, what is the nature of the

MR. ALSPAUGH:

Yes, sir.

In my judgment, you need to

5

use the same analysis as was used in the Davis case.

6

you looked at the State activities.

7

since the State Officials are subject to 1983, we're going to

8

make the Federal officials subject to 1983, looking at their

activities.

10

That is,

They said, in Davis, that

I think you could look the same way at the General

11

Motors question, you can look at the activities that are

12

analogous to the activities involved, and make a decision as to

13

whether or not that is governing or simply ministerially

14

carrying out the activities at the time.

QUESTION:

So it has to be the type of activity that

MR. ALSPAUGH:

That's the old proprietary governmental

The objective reasonableness in light of existing law is where

That is somewhat

It could qualify if you applied the

As I understand the facts in this

I think FTCA and I said in my brief is

In closing, I think that the law is clear that there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER, ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

22

MR. AYER:

The point I'd like to emphasize more than

23

any other is that immunity only has any useful effect if there

24

is some measure of certainty for the employees who are

25

protected by it.

And the rule that's been announced here, a

rule of policy and planning discretion is a rule that has no
