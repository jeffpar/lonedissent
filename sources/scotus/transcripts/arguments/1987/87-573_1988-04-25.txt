ORAL ARGUMENT BY EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether a

10

district court may properly dismiss an indictment with

11

prejudice when it finds a minor violation of the time limits

12

contained in the Speedy Trial Act of 1974.

13

The Speedy Trial Act provides, in general, that a

14

federal criminal prosecution, the trial in such a prosecution

15

must commence within 70 days of the returning and making public

16

of the indictment or information, or within 70 days of the

17

defendant's first appearance of a judicial officer of the

18

district, whichever occurs later.

19

The act, of course, contains certain exclusions from

20

the running of the 70-day time period, some of which were

21

applied in this case for such things as other proceedings

22

relating to the defendant, delay attributable to the removal or

23

transportation of a defendant from another district, and

24

continuances of the trial for situations in which the court

25

finds that the ends of justice would warrant such a

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

continuance.
Now, if the defendant is not brought to trial within

3

70 days, taking account of any exclusions, the statute provides

4

that the indictment or information shall be dismissed, but the

5

act does not provide that such an indictment must be with

6

prejudice, thereby forever closing the government from

7

prosecuting the defendant for the conduct underlying the

8

indictment or information.

9

Congress considered such a proposal and also a

10

proposal that would have created at least a presumption in

11

favor of a prohibition against reprosecution, but Congress

12

rejected that and instead adopted what is now in Section

13

3162(a)(2) of Title 18 dealing with the dismissal sanction.

14

There Congress provides that a balancing test must be

15

applied in determining whether the indictment should be

16

dismissed with our without prejudice.

17

specifically provided that the district court, in making that

18

determination, shall consider, among other things, each of

19

three separate factors.

20

And Congress

The first is the seriousness of the offense.

The

21

second is the facts and circumstances of the case that led to

22

the dismissal.

23

on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on the

24

adminstration of criminal justice.

25

And the third is the impact of a reprosecution

In this case, the Court of Appeals affirming the

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

district court found a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, a

2

total of 14 days by which the 70-day time limit was exceeded.

3

The Court of Appeals then affirmed the district court's

4

decision dismissing that indictment with prejudice despite the

5

existence of what, in our view, are a host of factors, all of

6

which weigh decidedly against that severe sanction.

7

For example --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler.
Yes.

What is the standard on appellate review?

Is it abuse of discretion?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That is the standard the courts have

13

applied, and we don't dispute that as the legal test.

14

is important to bear in mind several things along those lines.

15

This is not a situation in which the district court's

16

discretion is entirely unfettered.

17

But it

Congress prescribed the statutory standards that are

18

to be applied, the ones that I just recited.

19

essential for the Court of Appeals to evaluate the district

20

court's decision to see whether those factors were in fact

21

taken into account; whether all the subsidiary considerations,

22

for example, bearing on the administration of justice were

23

considered.

24

made a clear error in weighing the various considerations.

25

So it is

And then in addition, whether the district court

In this case, we believe that in fact the district

5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

court erred in both respects by not giving full consideration

2

to the relevant factors, and by committing a clear error in the

3

balancing to the extent it did consider them.
QUESTION:

4

You don't bring to us the question whether

5

or not the clock should have been restarted for the full 70

6

days?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

rejected that argument.
QUESTION:

9

11

The Court of Appeals

You did argue it below?

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

We do not.

We did argue that in the Court of

Appeals.
In fact, we do not dispute that there was a violation

12

13

of the Speedy Trial Act here.

14

doubt.

15

of justice continuances were calculated in this case led to the

16

scheduling of the trial on what the district court found to be

17

the 69th day of the 70-day period.

18

That conclusion is not free from

For example, the way in which the continuance, the end

As we point out in a footnote in our brief, however,

19

the premise of that was erroneous, and we disagree with the

20

court's failure to exclude six days of the time limit that we

21

explained at Pages 23 to 25 in our brief.

22

But as we present the case here, we assume that there

23

was a violation, as we counted it, of eight days.

24

are presenting the case on the question of remedy, not on

25

whether there was a violation, although I do think that

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And so we

1

certainly the length of the delay and the question of whether

2

it was a close question as to whether the act was even violated

3

would properly bear on the question of whether the indictment

4

should be dismissed with or without prejudice.

5

So to that extent, the various arguments in which

6

the -- whether the clock should be restarted would be relevant

7

on the question of remedy.

8

9

The various factors that we believe in this case
weight heaving against dismissing the indictment with prejudice

10

were, first, that the — as both courts below conceded, and as

11

Respondent does not contest, the offenses in this case,

12

narcotic offenses, both conspiracy and a possession count were

13

serious, carrying potential for imprisonment up to --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

What section of the criminal rules is it

17

that speaks of dismissal of indictments with prejudice or

18

without prejudice?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Rule 48 prior to the passage of

20

the Speedy Trial Act, Rule 48 of the criminal rules provided

21

for dismissal of cases basically for want of prosecution, and

22

then that was -- then when the Speedy Trial Clause of the

23

Constitution was given particular force in Barker v. Wingo,

24

that and the Speedy Trial Act have to some extend Rule 48 and

25

importance, but it would be Rule 48.

1

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

Well, for instance, supposingly we were

2

dealing with a violation of other than the Speedy Trial Act,

3

would a district court have authority to dismiss an indictment

4

with prejudice?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Ordinarily not.

A dismissal for want

6

of prosecution under Rule 48 I think would ordinarily be

7

without prejudice.

8

in at some point and bar reprosecution but --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Now the statute of limitations might kick

But here the Speedy Trial Act itself

authorizes dismissal with prejudice.
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

It's only because of

12

the -- under the Speedy Trial Act, it's because the Speedy

13

Trial Act authorizes the dismissal in that form.

14

to the district court a weighty responsibility to decide

15

whether the dismissal should be with or without prejudice,

16

because after all, a dismissal with prejudice results in the

17

freeing of a defendant without an adjudication of his guilt or

18

innocence, and it's generally regarded to be in the public

19

interest for criminal charges to be adjudicated on the merits,

20

and not dismissed for no reason -- not no reason at all, but

21

unless there are substantial reasons for doing so.

22

But it gives

And also, Congress specifically charged the courts

23

under the Speedy Trial Act with trying to draw the line between

24

the serious and less serious violations of the act.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, in deciding whether there

8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

was an abusive discretion in dismissing with prejudice rather

2

than without prejudice, do you think it's proper for us to take

3

into account that there was a subsisting charge which was not

4

dismissed and for which the judge imposed the maximum penalty,

5

which he might not have done had the other count not been

6

dismissed?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

other offense?

He got five years for what, what was the

I forget.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Well, I don't think it's —

For the failure to appear.

For not showing up a trial, right; failure

to appear.
MR. KNEEDLER:

We don't think that should play a

14

substantial role here.

15

sanctions for these offenses, and the narcotic offenses here

16

are serious, and carry more serious consequences.

17

Congress prescribed separate criminal

And at the time the indictment was dismissed here,

18

the district court had not yet imposed that sanction.

19

defendant had not yet pleaded guilty.

20

Congress, in the Speedy Trial Act, requires the court to focus

21

on the particular charges in the indictment.

22

reluctant to say that's altogether irrelevant, but we don't

23

think that given what Congress was focusing on, the charges in

24

the indictment and factors bearing on those charges in the

25

weighing process, that that factor should play a substantial

So in terms of —

And I am

9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The

1

role.
It's quite possible that if the Defendant was

2
3

convicted, that he could get a sentence considerably more than

4

the five years that he got on the failure to appear charge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, the statute was passed in

order to get prompt prosecutions, right?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

10

prosecutor.

13
14
15

And one way to do that is to prod the

If we say that all you can do is to dismiss

without prejudice, how would that prod the prosecutor?
MR. KNEEDLER:

11
12

Yes.

Well, first of all, we're not

saying -QUESTION:

If the only thing that will be done is to

say, oops, you shouldn't have done that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, first of all, we are not saying

16

that this Court should say that a court can never — the

17

district court can never dismiss with prejudice.

18

is that what the district courts are obligated to do is to try

19

to locate the case on a spectrum between the least serious

20

technical violations and the most serious.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Our position

And write that out.
Well, and the court should at least

23

focus on that question and dismiss only when there has been a

24

serious violation of the statutory standards.

25

QUESTION:

Do you want that in writing?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Pardon me?

Do you want that in writing?
From this Court?

No, from the trial court.
Yes.

I think that —

Is that what you are insisting on?
Well, the court -- it's not possible,

8

and I think this case is a good example of that.

A Court of

9

Appeals is somewhat at a loss if the district court declines to

10

address all of the relevant factors that Congress has made

11

relevant in the statute that must be weighed by the district

12

court.

13

QUESTION:

Did the government ask him for that?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't know that the government went

15

back and asked for more.

16

district court considered, for example, with respect to the

17

second and third factors under the statutory test, the second

18

being the facts and circumstances of the case leading to

19

dismissal, and the other being on the administration of the

20

act; all the court focused on was what it termed a

21

lackadaisical attitude of the marshall service in returning the

22

Defendant form California to Washington.

23

fled to California, and the marshall service was taking him

24

back.

But there are other consideration that are relevant

11

both to the facts and circumstances of the case and to the

2

administration of justice.

3

address those other considerations.

4

QUESTION:

Frankly, what worries me is if we are

going to have to take every one of these cases.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

And the district court did not

No, what we would hope is —

I would hope not.
And we would hope not to have to

present the Court with an occasion in the future.
What we would help is that the Court would make clear

11

that the district courts in this case really should apply two

12

principles that we think would give a lot of guidance to the

13

lower courts.

14

The first one is the one that I just mentioned, and

15

that is that the court must consider all of the factors that

16

Congress made relevant for the purpose of making the ultimate

17

determination.

18

in favor of dismissal with prejudice against those that weigh

19

against, the net circumstances of the case are sufficiently

20

aggravated that dismissal with prejudice is an appropriate

21

remedy after offsetting one against the other.

22

And that is whether offsetting those that weigh

And the other principle that we think would provide

23

useful guidance to the lower courts, in fact, it's generally

24

applied by the Courts of Appeals now, is that where you have a

25

serious offense as it's conceded here, an indictment should not

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

be dismissed with prejudice absent a correspondingly serious

2

violation or delay past the 70-day period, especially where,

3

again as here, there is no prejudice to the defendant resulting

4

from that delay.
QUESTION:

5
6

disregarded that principle?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

12

Yes, we do, because in the --

But not the first.
The district court conceded that this

was a serious violation of the act.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but your first principle, consider

all of the circumstances.
MR. KNEEDLER:

13

We think the district court violated

14

that too, because under the second and third factors in this

15

case, the district court, as I said, only focused on what it

16

termed the lackadaisical attitude of the marshall service which

17

we think is in fact a considerably overdrawn view, but it did

18

not consider the other circumstances under the second and third

19

factor.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, are you saying that we

21

should send the case back and ask him to reconsider all the

22

facts and write a more elaborate opinion before he comes to the

23

conclusion, or are we to decide that the —

24
25

#

Do you think the district court

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I think this Court can properly

reverse outright, and that's --

13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

We can weigh those facts and say it's

2

perfectly clear that the five-year sentence shouldn't have been

3

taken into consideration and all the rest of it, and evaluate

4

this history of events and say --

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

On your first point, the district

court did not rely on the five-year sentence.

7

QUESTION:

Well, maybe he did and maybe he didn't.

8

He didn't put it in the opinion, but I wonder if in the back of

9

the district judge's mind wasn't the fact that I know this man

10

is guilty of what happened in this courtroom and I'll slug it

11

to him on that, because five years is a pretty severe sentence

12

for that.

I take it that's not the guideline sentence, is it?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

15

But say he did in fact take that in, you

say that would be impermissible for him to take -MR. KNEEDLER:

16
17

That I don't know, Justice Stevens.

No, I didn't say it was impermissible.

I just don't think it was a substantial -QUESTION:

18

Well, if he writes an opinion and he

19

says, if he had pleaded guilty to the narcotics offense, I

20

think I would have given him five years based on guidelines or

21

other considerations, and I think I can give this man adequate

22

punishment by giving him five years for the flight, and I also

23

can clean up a problem in the marshall's office if I enter this

24

remedy.

25

Would that be an impermissible exercise of his

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

discretion?
MR. KNEEDLER:

2

Yes, I think that would be, because

3

again the escape was a separate offense, separately provided

4

for by Congress, and —
QUESTION:

5

But in some of your filings I think you

6

rely on the escape as something that justifies on the other

7

side of the coin, don't you?
MR. KNEEDLER:

8
9

to the second and third parts of the balance of test.
QUESTION:

10
11

12

Well, but it does factor in directly

Even though he got adequately punished for

it.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but it also goes directly --

13

yes, yes, definitely, because it goes directly to, for example,

14

the facts and circumstances of this case.

15

scheduled on the 69th day.

16

but within the 70-day period, and it was Respondent who didn't

17

show up, and thereby undermined, seriously undermined the

18

purposes of the Speedy Trial Act.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

The trial here was

In fact, probably even the 69th,

But does that go to the question of

whether there was a violation of the clock?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, they also go, in our view, to the

22

question of whether the indictment should be dismissed with

23

prejudice, because one of the factors is the facts and

24

circumstances of the case leading to dismissal.

25

event here was the Respondent not showing up for his trial.

15
Heritage Reporting Corporation

The triggering
It

1

was a "but for" cause and he precipitated the occasion for the

2

subsequent violation.
QUESTION:

3

In any event, the real thrust of your

4

argument is not that he should take another look at all the

5

facts that you describe.

6

clear that we can examine the record and decide --

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

-- as a matter of law in this case it had

to be without prejudice.
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

11

But rather, that the facts are so

Right, and there are two reasons why I

think that would be proper.

12

First, the question of whether the district court's

13

discretion was abused under the standard of review that I was

4

describing as a question of law.
And, second, we think, in partial response to Justice

5
16

Marshall's question, that it would provide useful guidance for

7

this Court, to the lower courts to describe this case as one

8

that was outside of, in our view, any reasonable ambit of

9

discretion the district court would have in a situation like

20
21

this .
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, suppose I agree with you on

22

that that it is beyond the bounds of discretion, and suppose I

23

also agree with you that it would have been improper for the

24

court to make up for one mistake by making a second mistake,

25

giving too high a sentence on the flight charge, where does

6
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that leave me?
That means I can correct one mistake, but leave the

2

3

other mistake there.

4

well, gee, if this thing isn't going to be dismissed with

5

prejudice and he's going to get some time on this drug charge,

6

I really wouldn't have given him five years.
MR. KNEEDLER:

7
8

11

There are two responses to that, at

least.
The first is we don't know that it was a mistake, or

9
0

I mean what if the district judge knew,

that the judge would have responded differently.

But the

second --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

But the second point is that if the judge feels

15

We don't know it wasn't either, though.
No, that's true.

that's true, the judge -- all we're talking about is

6

reinstating the -- or allowing the reindictment.

If the

7

respondent is convicted, the district judge could make the sort

8

of adjustment you are talking about in imposing a sentence on

9

the narcotics offenses.

So it's not now or never in terms of

20

taking into account any possible interplay between the two

21

offenses.

22

QUESTION:

Do we know it will be the same judge?

23

won't be the same judge.

24

be in a different court now, won't it?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

It

It will be in a different -- it will

No, the escape and substantive

7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

offenses were both — were both in the Western District of
Washington.

Ordinarily it would go back to the same judge.

But anyway there would be that occasion for making an
adjustment if the district court imposed a sentence on an
erroneous premise.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, when the trial judge

considered this matter, did she take testimony for the marshall
service?
MR. KNEEDLER:
affidavits.

No, the finding was based on

There was an affidavit submitted by a DEA agent

explaining the basis for the transportation delay.

There were

actually three periods of delay that the court found in terms
of finding of violation.
In terms of the remedy, the district court -- the
record doesn't indicate the district court considered anything
beyond that.

And I think what you bring up I think raises

another important point.

And that is that the statute

3162(a)(2) specifically provides that the defendant bears the
burden on a motion to dismiss.
And in the Melguizo case, which is pending on
certiorari here, the Court of Appeals in that case said that
that includes the burden of showing that there is a systemic
problem in the government's handling of prisoners or bringing
cases to trial that warrants some sort of didactic sanction.
And the defendant in that case came forward with no evidence

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

showing that there was some general problem in the

2

administration of the Speedy Trial Act.
Similarly here, the Respondent didn't come forward

3
4

with any general evidence, or at least the record doesn't

5

indicate that there was a problem with the marshall service

6

transporting prisoners.
QUESTION:

7

Well, the judge was obviously disturbed

8

about something the government said or did in order to make the

9

finding that the government had a lackadaisical attitude.
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Well, all the district court said was

11

that, and in fact that is —

12

QUESTION:

13

But there is no evidence in the record to

support that; is that your position?
MR. KNEEDLER:

14

Well, all the — no, all the district

15

court relied on was the sequence of events in California before

16

Respondent was returned to Washington State.
QUESTION:

17

There was an affidavit from DEA.

No

18

affidavit from the marshall, affidavit from the United States

19

Attorney?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

On this point, no.

And there was a

21

declaration by Respondent's counsel.

22

think it was just the two affidavits from the DEA agent and I

23

guess two declarations from Respondent's counsel.

24
25

QUESTION:

But on this question I

I thought it was in the record that the

reason for the delay in sending him back up to Washington was

19

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the marshall was waiting to get together a bunch of prisoners

2

so that the cost of transporting them would be less.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, that appears --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

goes to one of the three periods.

7

statute provides a rebuttable presumption that anything in

8

excess of 10 days is unreasonable.

That's in the record, isn't it?
That appears in the affidavit.
It took 14 days.

That

The

Here the affidavit stated that the -- that four of

9
10

the days were while the marshall was waiting to assembly a

11

group of prisoners to take up to Washington and Oregon in order

12

to save money.
Another period of the delay in this case are the six

13

14

days that we say shouldn't have been included at all was the

15

six days between February 22nd, when the federal case in which

16

Respondent was to testify was over, and February 28th, when the

17

state charges in California in which Respondent was being held

18

was dismissed.
Well, during that period the marshall service was

19
20

under no responsibility to take Respondent back to Washington

21

because the state charges were still pending, and in fact he

22

was being held in a state jail in San Francisco.

23

that six-day period there wasn't even a violation at all, in

24

our view.

25

So during

The remaining time is the period from March 1 of '85

20
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

*

1

to March 6th of '85, the time between when the marshall/service

2

was told that the state charges against Respondent were

3

dismissed and Respondent's first appearance before a magistrate

4

for a removal hearing under Rule 40(e).

5

period certainly doesn't warrant dismissal on an indictment

6

with prejudice.

7

For one thing, as soon as Respondent had his initial

8

appearance, there were then three continuances, all either

9

agreed to or asked for by his counsel to keep him in California

10

for another month.

11

back, so far as the record shows, and these transcripts -- let

me add that, Justice Kennedy.

not challenging that, yes; there were eight days beyond the 70

days .

Well, don't you agree that there was eight

QUESTION:

I don't understand what you're talking

about.
MR. KNEEDLER:

There were only eight days past the

70-day period, and in our view that is so minimal that it

cannot

QUESTION:

Eight days is minimal?

3

tried in jail for eight days?
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

Have you ever

Well, Respondent was held during the

5

relevant period in custody on the bench warrant for his failure

6

to appear at trial in Washington when it was scheduled, and

7

there was not Speedy Trial Act problem with that, and he was

8

held in custody because he had escaped, or had fled to

9

California.
So there was no prejudice relevant for purposes of

10

11

this case by virtue of the fact that he was held in custody

12

during that period.

13

QUESTION:

4
15

Well, are you asking us to announce the

general rule that any delay of less than two days, five days,
0 days shall not give rise to a dismissal with prejudice?
MR. KNEEDLER:

6

Well, I don't think that there is a

17

magical point, but the courts have generally, and we state some

18

of these cases in our brief.
QUESTION:

9

We should superimpose a secondary line in

20

addition to the 70-day deadline, we have sort of a second

21

deadline where you are eligible for dismissal with prejudice?
MR. KNEEDLER:

22

Well, not an absolute deadline

23

because, again, it might well depend on the circumstances of

24

the case.

Would it be permissible in your view for

a trial judge to say, this is the fifth time I have had a 72-

is very much, but the U.S. Attorney has done it three times in

I think I will dismiss this with prejudice to let him

8

Well, I would be reluctant to say on a

72-day one, but some period -QUESTION:

9

Well, say 10, 10 72-day ones.

Say the

10

internal procedures in the U.S. Attorney's Office just seemed

11

regularly to not meet the 70-day one, but they always got in

12

within 75 days.

13

I'll dismiss it?

Could the judge sooner or later say I think

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

At some point, yes, I think --

And he can rely on what happened in other

cases as a basis for doing that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

17

At some point, I think the court

18

probably could.

19

look to see what the nature of the failing in the individual

20

cases was.

21

that wouldn't lend themselves to a systemic solution.

22

But again, I think the court would want to

It may be that they all had individual explanations

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question that doesn't seem

23

to be covered by the briefs, and I'm not sure that there is

24

anything -- The states also have equivalent requirements of

25

prompt trial within a fixed number of days, at least a number

23
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

of states do.
Do you know if the normal remedy that applies in the
states is dismissal with prejudice or without prejudice?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't know the current status.

There was some discussion of the comparable state laws at the
time the '74 act was passed.

And my recollection is that

California was cited as the leading example, and California had
dismissal without prejudice.
Now I don't know what the general state of the law -but, of course, here Congress prescribed the bottom line.
QUESTION:
anyway.

I understand.

It wouldn't be controlling

My recollection of Illinois was the other way around;

that it was a flat prohibition -MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and there might have been

variation. In fact, the ABA had recommended that in 1974, but
Congress declined to adopt it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, if you should prevail here,

is there any statute of limitations problem for the government
that exists with all of the additional passage of time when MR. KNEEDLER:
term.

No, not if the case is decided this

I believe the statute of limitations would be -- the

offenses were charged in December of 1983.

So if the case is

disposed of this term, there would be time for a reindictment
prior to December of 1988.
QUESTION:

I take it you don't defend the position of

24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

the marshall service that they were waiting to get a bus for a
group of prisoners, that they had the absolute duty to
transport this one prisoner immediately; is that your
understanding?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we don't believe that they have a

duty to do it immediately.

The statute in fact sets up a

rebuttable presumption that any time in excess of 10 days is
unreasonable.

We don't say that —

QUESTION:

Is there a provision in the statute which

allows delays for transportation purposes?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, there is an exclusion under the

Speedy Trial Act, Paragraph H, which excludes time involved in
the transportation of the defendant from one district to
another, and that exclusion establishes a rebuttable
presumption that any time in excess of 10 days is unreasonable
I think the import of that is that just because it's
over 10 days doesn't mean that it's automatically unreasonable
and the assembling of prisoners to transport prisoners ip an
economical fashion is certainly a permissible goal.
We just aren't raising here -- we aren't challenging
the finding below that that was a violation in the
circumstances of this case, because we think the remedy
question is of broader importance.
If there are no further questions at this point, I
would like to reserve the balance of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

2

We will hear now from you, Mr. Loveseth.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT BY IAN G. LOVESETH, ESQ.

4
5
6

Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LOVESETH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the members of the Court:

7

In this case there was a series of delays in handling

8

a person who had initially escaped from custody and was brought

9

back into the system.

Now that particular situation was

10

brought to the attention of Congress at the time that the

11

Speedy Trial Act was passed.

12

their attention that in that situation the way the Congress had

13

orchestrated the act, it was going to require that people in

14

this situation, post-indictment fugitives who are caught

15

subsequent to their flight, were going to have to be given

16

priority because they were not going to restart the clock.

17

They were going to only give them, in terms of the Speedy Trial

18

Act, as much time as was remaining on that speedy trial clock

19

at the time that they failed to appear.

20

And it was actually brought to

This was something that was considered.

This was a

21

duty, an affirmative duty that the court, the trial court found

22

that the United States Attorney failed.

23

She felt that with this duty it was his obligation to

24

show prosecutorial initiative, make sure the marshals did it

25

correctly, make sure the marshals were aware that there was a

26
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

short amount of time left.
Now there is no reason why the Speedy Trial Act

2
3

should be violated because a person does what Mr. Taylor did in

4

this case.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Loveseth, do you think that the trial

6

court though has a duty to consider any prejudice to the

7

defendant in making a decision whether to dismiss with

8

prejudice to the state?

9

MR. LOVESETH:

I think it is permissible for the

10

trial court to consider prejudice.

11

mandatory.

12

QUESTION:

I don't think it's

Do you think the trial court should be

required to consider them?
MR. LOVESETH:

Not when she finds that the -- I don't

15

think she would be required to consider it, or give it as much

16

weight, particularly in a situation whereas here.

17

culpable conduct on the part of the government.

18

QUESTION:

She found

Well, in this case, I gather the Defendant

19

would have to remain in jail in any event because of the new

20

charge of leaving before the trial and so forth?

21

MR. LOVESETH:

Well, I would like to think maybe I

22

could get him bail, but I would agree that it would

23

substantially increase, and I think in all probability he would

24

have stayed in.

25

But there is an additional prejudice here that I'm

A person, any person who

As I calculated both is trips up and down, he was in
12 different institutions.

QUESTION:

He came in.

Well, I guess none of this would have

10

happened if he hadn't fled the scene in the first place, would

11

it?
MR. LOVESETH:

12

Well, I think that may be true, except

13

that Congress intended that a person who flees would not

14

restart the clock, and that that would be taken care of by

15

excluding the time.

His flight did not contribute to the violation of the

17

QUESTION:

5

MR. LOVESETH:

No, not at all.

All right.
I don't think it's -- it didn't lead

6

to the dismissal.

So I don't think it's considerable under the

7

second required statutory fact, or the facts and circumstances

8

that led to the dismissal.
It is clearly something that the Court can take into

I've got to make sure the

But I am going to give him five on

That really is imputing an extraordinary

29
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

amount of discretion to the district court to say that sort of

2

shifting back and forth is permissible, it seems to me.
MR. LOVESETH:

3

Well, I think that one of the aims of

4

this Speedy Trial Act was to give the court a lot of discretion

5

to deal with the act and its application in their district.

6

And there as a systemic problem that was recognized back in --

7

I mean it's in the legislative history about marshals trying to

8

assemble prisoners and move them in an economical fashion.
And I'll point out that when the writ of habeas

9
10

corpus ad testificandum that was served on him. after he had

11

begun his journey back to Seattle was served on him, they had

12

him down here in a couple of days, three, four days.
I mean when they want to move fast, they can move

13
14
15

f ast.
QUESTION:

You say there was a systemic problem, but

16

you say that was what Congress -- you are not saying that Judge

17

Rothstein thought there was a systemic problem in the marshall

18

service here.

19

indicate she did.

20

What I read of what she wrote, it does not

MR. LOVESETH:

Well, she felt that -- she felt that

21

the marshall was going to do what it normally did, and that is

22

wait until prisoners get -- wait until they get a substantial

23

number of prisons and then move them along.

24
25

She felt that the prosecutor, the United State
Attorney's Office was lackadaisical in not making sure that

30

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

they understood that if they took longer than 10 days, I mean

2

the act gives them 10 days to make the move.
QUESTION:

3

Well, it gives them 10 days, and then it

4

creates a rebuttable presumption after that.

5

them a flat 10 days with everything cut off after that.
MR. LOVESETH:

6

It doesn't give

I understand that, but the government

7

had an opportunity to rebut that presumption, had an

8

opportunity to come in and talk about the marshall's problems,

9

and they didn't do it.

There was no particular problem here.

10

And I think it's shown by the fact that they moved them down in

11

four days when they wanted him back down here for a trial.

12

The marshall moves at the reguest of other agencies.

13

You know, if left to their own devices, they'll take their own

14

time.

15

Attorney wanted someone transported, and they chartered a plane

16

and moved him in two hours.

But I've had cases involved where the United States

QUESTION:

17

Well, Mr. Loveseth, it is, after all,

18

somewhat of a burden for the state if the case is dismissed

19

without prejudice.

20

So it isn't as though there isn't some penalty being imposed by

21

virtue of just dismissing it without prejudice; isn't that

22

right?

23

It reguires them to start all over again.

MR. LOVESETH:

I would agree that it is a burden on

24

the state to proceed again.

I think that what this court did

25

was remove that burden by taking the total conduct of the

31
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

a»

1

Defendant, both his flight and what could be attributed to the

2

drug case, assuming he was guilty; figured that she could cover

3

all of that conduct with a five-year sentence, based on the

4

fact that the co-defendant got three.

5

important to send a message to the marshal^, send a message to

6

the United States Attorney that just because a guy runs away

7

does not mean that he loses all of his speedy trial rights, and

8

that the system itself needed to be shaken a little bit to make

9

sure that they were going to fulfill their responsibilities.

10

♦

In future cases when you represent the

11

defendant in sentencing, will you concede the fact that -- that

12

the fact and circumstance that an indictment has been dismissed

13

without prejudice should be considered adversely to your client

14

on the remaining charges?

15

MR. LOVESETH:

I argued that at the time of the

16

sentencing for Mr. Taylor.

17

for him to live in custody, and he was going to do time on the

18

bail jump, with the knowledge that this case might result in a

19

reversal and he might face additional time, or not know whether

20

he was going to face additional time, and I argued to the court

21

that she should sentence him for the total conduct so that he

22

would know, even if it got reversed, that he was not going to

23

have to spend a bunch of time.

24

QUESTION:

But she felt it was

I told the judge at that time that

I mean he

account in terms of the parole the fact -- they assumed the

2

underlying offense was there, and that he was guilty of it, and

3

so his guidelines were adjusted upward, and he served a

4

substantial amount of the time that he was sentenced to.

5

think he served three and a half to four years, which would be

much more than a normal person would on a five-year sentence,

with no essential criminal history.

34
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

He knew there

was only one day left of the speedy trial time, and yet he did
nothing to make the system work a little faster, and that was a
concept that was discussed in the legislative history.

It was

brought to the attention of Congress by Mr. Snead from the U.S.
Attorney's Office.

And he says, we're going to have to give

these guys priority if you don't restart the clock.
Now, I will agree that maybe Congress ought to change
that, and restart the clock and give it a little extra time,
but they didn't.

The statutory scheme is as it is, and the

duty was -- the duty was on the prosecutor to make sure that
the system responded quickly and gave this guy a chance to get
back up before the Speedy Trial Act was violated.
And then in terms of the remedy, she did exactly what
the statute told her to do.

She said, look, it's a serious

offense, but, too, I believe it was the government's conduct
that led to the dismissal and that requires a stern response.
And that if I'm going to administer the act and justice in this
court and in this district, I have to respond sternly;
otherwise the Speedy Trial Act is just a hollow guarantee and
it doesn't really mean anything.
She had enough time to make it -- I mean this is not
a miscarriage of justice.

This man got five years in a

situation where had it just been the bail jump, I don't think
she would have even considered giving him that much.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

There

are several points I would like to make.
First, Respondent is wrong that his flight did not
contribute, or was not one of the facts and circumstances
leading to the dismissal in this case.
As the record makes completely clear, trial was
scheduled on November 19, 1984, and if Respondent had shown up
like he was supposed to, the trial would have been held within
the Speedy Trial Act 70-day period and there would have been no
occasion for a violation at all.
And secondly, Respondent contributed by virtue of the
fact that the delays found by the district court here were all
involved in returning Respondent from the place to which he had
fled back to the place in which he was supposed to be tried.
So Respondent cannot avoid all culpability for the
Speedy Trial Act violation simply by saying he was separately
prosecuted for the failure to show up.

His flight directly

ties in to one of the statutory purposes on the remedy, and
that is the effect of a reprosecution on the administration of
the Speedy Trial Act.

Respondent undermined the purposes of

the Speedy Trial Act and a reprosecution of Respondent would
demonstrate that a defendant who deliberately flouts that act
will not get away with it, and will be -- and the charges that

37

(202) 628-4888

he sought to to avoid will in fact be prosecuted.
The second point I would like to say is that counsel
says that the marshall service ignored an order of February
20th requiring the marshall to return Respondent to state
custody.

In fact, that order, which appears at the excerpt of

record on page 20, is directed to the sheriff of San Francisco
County, not to the marshall service.

And there was no doubt

that if the San Mateo Court had wanted Respondent for an
appearance, it could have gotten him from the sheriff.

There

is no indication in fact that the marshall service was aware of
that order.
The third point is that as the record shows the
Assistant U.S. Attorney in fact believed the clock restarted
when Respondent was brought back to Washington.

And far from

being recalcitrant, he was operating on a misunderstanding of
what the act requires.
And the fourth point I wanted to make is that
although the district court —
QUESTION:

Is that in the record, Mr. Kneedler?

MR. KNEEDLER:

There is a district court brief filed

by the Assistant United States Attorney and the brief in the
Court of Appeals he argued that the entire period was — or the
clock restarted.
The last point I wanted to make is that although the
district court recited the second and third facts, the facts

conduct.

4

and the effect on the adminstration of justice that weigh

5

strongly against dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.

She didn't focus on the other facts and circumstances

9

other ones?

10

Is it appropriate for a trial judge to increase the

That's appropriate, isn't it?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't know that it's prohibitive,

11

but that should not -- I mean if it was a totally unrelated

12

charge, should that entitle a district court to dismiss an

13

indictment with prejudice?

14

We think not.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's what I'm asking you.
We think not.

The court, in deciding

17

whether to dismiss the indictment, should focus on the charges

18

in that indictment and the government's conduct with respect to

19

those charges, not on some unrelated offense, a state offense

20

or some unrelated federal offense.

21

Here it happened to be related, but we don't think

22

that that has any bearing on the court's requirement to focus

23

on the seriousness of the charges carrying 15 years offenses,

24

narcotics offenses, and the fact that the Defendant's flight

25

undermined the purposes of the act.
