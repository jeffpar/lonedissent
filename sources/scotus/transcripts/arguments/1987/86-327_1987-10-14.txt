ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK E. SOLOMONS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

7

MR. SOLOMONS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court, the Black Lung Benefits Act is a federally based

9

workers compensation program which provides benefits on account

10

of total disability or death of a coalminer due to black lung

11

disease.

12

billions of dollars in benefits in this program by proving

13

their entitlement to these benefits under a regulation which

14

is called the interim presumption.

15

Hundreds of thousands of claimants have been awarded

Since its inception 15 years ago, the two agencies

16

which promulgated and have administered this presumption, the

17

Social Security Administration, and after them the Department

18

of Labor, have required proof of an indication of fact by a

19

preponderance of the relevant evidence.

20

The Fourth Circuit in its divided opinion below

21

strikes down the preponderance rule for invocation of this

22

presumption and replaces it with a new rule which requires

23

invocation on virtually any evidence at all in isolation

24

from the record and whether or not that evidence is reliable

25

and accurate.

The Fourth Circuit's rule is, we think, unprecedented

2

in the context presented.

3

dants of the right to answer critical evidence where it is most

4

significant in the analysis of the case.

5

for the proposition that one party's proof in an important poin

6

in the case is simply better than another's.

7

It effectively strips claim defen­

We think it stands

The question that is presented here for this Court

8

is whether in the invocation of this presumption the claimant

9

must establish invocation by a preponderance of the evidence.

10

We think that he must, and we think so for two reasons.

11

because the Secretary of Labor has consistently and over a

12

long period of time required claimants through the Secretary's

13

interpretation of its regulation to establish indication by

14

a preponderance of the evidence,

15

more importantly, because we think Congress has spoken on this

16

issue as well through the Administrative Procedure Act,and

17

through the Administrative Procedure Act

18

holding that the invocation . of a presumption of this sort can

19

only be established in an APA proceeding by a preponderance of

20

the evidence.

21

QUESTION:

First,

and secondly, and perhaps

has compelled a

Mr. Solomons, I am a little unclear how

22

this argument you are making squares with what the SG tells us

23

is the true doubt rule that is applied in these cases, and I

24

would like you to tell me whether you are suggesting in effect

25

or implicitly asking us

to say there isn't any such thing as
4

1

a true doubt.

Or would that be the effect of agreeing on this

2

burden of proof question, which seems to me a little different

3

from the question of what the trier of fact should consider

4

in the way of evidence.

5

MR. SOLOMONS:

Aren't you going beyond that?
Well, I think we are going just a

6

little bit beyond the true doubt rule.

I think it is impor­

7

tant for the Court to recognize that the true doubt rule is a

8

rule which is very rarely applied in these cases.

9

applied, and I think largely without contest, in a case where

It has been

10

there — in the invocation analysis there are two absolutely

11

equal pieces of evidence, and the Administrative Law Judge at

12

that point has been permitted in the past to say, I will

13

resolve these doubts in favor of the claimant.

14

The precise meaning of the true doubt rule, and that

15

is not a troubling rule, we do not think that the rule is pre­

16

cisely in accord with the Administraive Procedure Act, because

17

we think under the Administrative Procedure Act the claimant

18

is required to prove, at least in the invocation analysis, that

19

invocation of this presumption is a very easy task, that his

20

evidence is just a tiny bit better, and establish —

21

QUESTION:

Well, do we even have to decide in this

22

case whether there is such a thing as a true doubt rule and

23

the burden of persuasion issue that you are discussing?

24
25

MR. SOLOMONS:

Well, I don't think the Court has to

decide whether there is a true doubt rule.

by the fact that after all when all else fails you have the

20
21

22

I think that there are arguments pro and con on the

These argu­

I am not prepared to say that the true doubt rule
is absolutely wrong.
I think it is important in understanding how this

23

presumption works to look at its mechanics just briefly.

24

award of benefits under this program requires the presence of

25

three statutory elements.

First, the claimant must have
6

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

An

Pneumoconiosis is a statutory term which is

1

pneumoconiosis.

2

defined somewhat more broadly than the medical term is defined.

3

This pneumoconiosis or this disease must be occupationally

4

caused.

5

total disability or death of the coalminer.

6

And the disease must in addition to that result in the

Now, when you take this in the context of the interim

7

presumption, what we find is that the invocation of the pre­

8

sumption presumes that all three of the statutory elements are

9

present, but invocation facts generally

10
11

do not prove that any

one of the basic elements of entitlement are present.
Now, there is one exception to that where an invo­

12

cation fact may prove but one element but there is no invoca-

13

fact that proves two.

14

The plain language of the regulation, lookinq- both

15

at the invocation and rebuttal provisions, I think clearly

16

demonstrates that there is a mismatch between the invocation

17

facts and rebuttal facts.

18

Evidence of the type which is required to establish invocation

19

of the presumption typically and generally cannot prove

20

rebuttal, but even: more important, invocation facts are not

21

rebuttal facts.

They are simply not the same.

22

The claimant could establish invocation in the sorts

23

of cases that are presented here by proving but one of several

24

simple medical facts, that he has an x-ray, a biopsy which is

25

indicative of some clinical lung disease, or that he has
7

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

ventilatory studies or arterial blood gas test data which when

2

looking simply at the raw data is indicative of a chronic

3

impairment of respiratory function, or that there is physician

4

opinion evidence that the individual is totally disabled by a

5

respiratory or pulmonary impairment.
Looking at these three, these four presumption

6
7

invocation facts, it should be clear that perhaps with the

8

possible exception of the x-ray fact, which could be estab­

9

lished, that we are not talking about the basic fundamental

10

elements of entitlement.

11

invocation facts are different.

12

presumption.

13

come back in the rebuttal phase and say that claimant's invo­

14

cation evidence, his blood gas evidence or his ventilatory

15

study evidence is completely false or invalid because it proves

16

nothing.

17

Those are what is presumed.

The

the rebuttal phase.

You decide invocation

You decide rebuttal facts in

There is very little interplay between
8

1

the two.

But all we are looking for here, and what we have

2

had for 15 years prior to the Fourth Circuit's decision is

3

the right to participate in the whole case.

4

have the opportunity to cross examine and litigate, not only

5

with respect to the rebuttal, but with respect to the invoca­

6

tion of the presumption as well.

We would like to

We think it is only fair.

What the Fourth Circuit's rule overlooks is this

7
8

fundamental mismatch between the invocation and rebuttal

9

facts.

And in so doing it permits evidence which we can prove

10

to be undeniably false to in many cases to control the outcome

11

of the case.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

When we rose, Mr.

4

Solomons, I believe Justice Scalia was in the process of

5

putting a question to you.

6

QUESTION: You were making the point that we had to

7

adopt the position you were urging because otherwise you would

8

have an opportunity to rebut the data under Subsection (a).

9

But it occurs to me that even if we adopt the position that

10

you espouse, which is essentially the position that the

11

government takes following the agency's interpretation of its

12

rule, you won't necessarily

13

evidence that is brought forward under (a).

14

have a chance to rebut all the

For example, under (a)2 the presumption is estab­

15

lished if ventilatory studies establish the presence of a

16

chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease.

17

the way the agency applies the statute it will allow as

18

rebuttal under (a) only studies of the same sort, so only

19

ventilatory studies that refute the presence of a chronic

20

respiratory or pulmonary disease would be allowed in.

agency's position.

Now, am I wrong about their position?

If I am right about their position, then your

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - RESUMED
MR. SOLOMONS:

5

Well, you are right about their posi­

6

tion, I am relatively sure, and we agree with it completely.

7

All we are asking for in connection with the invocation

8

inquiry is the opportunity to have like kind evidence, whether

9

it is x-rays or ventilatory studies, considered with other

10

x-rays and ventilatory studies.
QUESTION:

11

Okay, but then you are bound to acknow­

12

ledge that even under your position the statute doesn't make

13

a whole lot of sense, that there

14

are never going to be able to use to refute other evidence,

15

right?

16

MR. SOLOMONS:

is

some evidence that you

Well, our position is that once you

17

get to the rebuttal inquiry, the evidence that we could be --

18

that is properly considered in the invocation inquiry doesn't

19

have much of a place once you finally get to rebuttal.

20

doesn't have much meaning.

21

or irrelevant, but it certainly does not assist in proving a

22

rebuttal fact.

23

It

It is not totally insignificant

And I think what is most important here is to look

24

at the recent Fourth Circuit decisions in their efforts to

25

apply their own rule.

In those decisions, which we have cited
12

Acme Reporting Company

in our reply brief, it is perfectly clear that the Fourth

2

Circuit is simply not considering ventilatory studies or blood

disease in the context of the rebuttal inquiry.

8

tory evidence has a place to be considered.

And so under the Fourth Circuit's rule as they have

QUESTION:

9

They refuse

Under your rule it is just a lesser

10

amount of contradictory evidence that has no place, but you

will have to admit that there is some contradictory evidence

that will have no place, even under your rule.

13

shows contrary to a ventilatory study, that there is no

14

respiratory or pulmonary disease, where do you get that in

15

under your position?
MR. SOLOMONS:

16

An autopsy that

Well, the autopsy is considered in

17

part of the invocation analysis where you determine whether

18

the autopsy by itself or the autopsy in conjunction with other

19

autopsy reports invokes the presumption.

Right.

Acme Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Well, why is that?

2

MR. SOLOMONS:

That makes no sense.

What you can do with an autopsy

3

study arguably is use it in the first instance to determine

4

under the first section of the invocation provision whether

5

the individual has coalworkers' pneumoconiosis.

6

place where that kind of evidence is listed and where that

7

kind of evidence ought to be considered.

8

orderly pattern where like kind evidence is considered with

9

other like kind evidence in a reasonably logical fashion under

10

the government's rule and under the rule that we are espousing

11

here.

12
13
14

That is the

It is a logical and

We are not suggesting that evidence which is in mis­
match ought to be considered together.

What we are suqaesting

is, and the original argument, I think, where this line of

15

questioning began is that the invocation facts which have to

16

be proven by the claimant and the rebuttal facts which we are

17

required to prove create an essential mismatch, and since there

18

is no bursting bubble, once we get past the invocation phase

19

and this logical and orderly consideration of the facts which

20

need to be proven in a burden-shifting presumption, that we

21

reach the point where the evidence makes sense, or the consi­

22

deration of the evidence makes sense.

23

The preponderance standard for consideration of

24

invocation evidence that has been adopted by the government

25

is the traditional rule for application in a burden-shifting
14

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

626-4886

presumption.

2

well for many years and there has been no reason to change it.

3

Indeed, we think the Fourth Circuit had no reason to change

4

it.

5

has found no reason to comment on the agency's apprqach.

6

It is logical and it is fair.

It has worked

It simply requires valid

We think that the preferable methodo­

10

logy for the resolution of the questions that are presented

11

here is the Administrative Procedure Act.

12

I say that because it is in the Administrative Pro­

13

cedure Act that Congress has spoken on the issue that is

presented in this case.

We think that this is an appropriate place for

Looking specifically at the invocation provisions,
in Steadman versus the Securities and Exchange Commission,
15

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

this Court held after a comprehensive review of the lecrisla-

2

tive history of the APA that the proponent of a sanction is

3

required to prove the facts necessary to support it by sub­

4

stantial, that is, by a preponderance of the evidence.

So says the

Steadman also holds that where the quantum of proof
required to prove a fact is not specified in the underlying

10

statutes, that is where the Administrative Procedure Act

11

steps in in a program in which it is applicable to supply the

12

preponderance standard.

13

This holding in Steadman with no great leap of logic

14

reasonably and naturally extends to invocation of a burden-

15

shifting presumption like the interim presumption.

16

and rebuttal under the interim presumption are separate and

17

distinct fact inquiries.

What the statute does specify is that the APA

21

applies, and we think, as in Steadman, that the APA supplies

22

the preponderance rule for invocation as well as for rebuttal

23

of this presumption.

24
25

QUESTION:

What do you do about what the government

points out in Footnote 30 of its brief, which is that the APA
16

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

626-4886

1

is excluded in cases where it is otherwise provided by regula­

2

tions of the secretary?

3

MR. SOLOMONS:

Well, the reliance placed there is

4

on Section 422(a) of the Black Lung Act.

Section 422(a)

5

authorized the Secretary to write regulations which deviate

6

from the Longshore Act.

7

claim — and it has been rejected by every circuit, and it

8

has been rejected by Congress.

9

exemption from the APA in the Black Lung Program they have

I do not think that the Secretary's

When they really need an

10

gone to Congress to get it.

11

strongly they believe that in fact Section 422(a) provides

12

them with the exemption that they request.
QUESTION:

13
14

And so obviously I wonder how

It does say that, except as otherwise

provided by regulations, et cetera.
MR. SOLOMONS:

15

It says the Longshore Act applies

16

except as otherwise provided by regulations of the Secretary.

17

I don't know that that necessarily would give the Secretary

18

the carte blanche to pick and choose from among the APA rules

19

that he would like to apply and those which he would not

20

like to apply.
Looking at the decisions of this Court, I think

21
22

that that claim for supersedure would go far beyond any holding

23

that this Court or, for that matter, the circuits have ever

24

reached.

25

It is just too broad.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time

7

the Court, under the regulations at issue here, a miner with

8

ten or more years of coal mine experience need only establish

9

one of four basic facts in order to create a presumption of

10

compensable disability.

11

For example, he can prove the existence of pneumo­

12

coniosis by virtue of certain x-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evi~

13

dence, or he can prove a disabling pulmonary impairment by

14

virtue of certain test evidence.

15

basic fact in question, the burden then shifts to the mine

16

owner or the director to rebut the presumption of compensable

17

disability.

18

Once he establishes the

The regulations only permit the mine owner to rebut

19

the presumption by establishing either that the miner is not

20

disabled or that he does not suffer from pneumoconiosis or

21

that his condition is not caused by coal mine employment.

22

The word "establish" in the rebuttal provisions has

23

been universally interpreted at the director's urging to mean

24

proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

25

The question presented here is what the burden of
18

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

1

proof is on the miner at the initial invocation stage.

The

2

regulations there also state that he must establish the basic

3

fact in question, and the director has interepreted the word

4

"established" there to mean the same thing it means in the

5

rebuttal portion of the regulations.

6

the fact in question by a preponderance of the evidence.

That is, he must prove

7

The regulations on this point are not ambiguous, but

8

what I hope to show is that only the director's interpretation

9

can ultimately be squared with the language of the regulations.

10
11
12
13
14
15

I would like to deal straightaway with what appears
to be the greatest problem for the director's interpretation,
and that is the first invocation category, which permits the
presumption to be invoked upon proof that a chest x-rav,
biopsy or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.
Viewed in isolation, the singular there, the reference

16

to a chest x-ray might seem to support the Court of Appeals'

17

view of the regulations.

18

strongly supports the director's interpretation.

19

of that invocation category is taken directly verbatim from

20

the 1972 regulations of the Social Security Administration

21

dealing with black lung claims filed prior to July of 1973.

22

In fact, seen in context, the language
The language

The consistent interpretation of that exact same

23

language is that the miner must prove the facts in question

24

by a preponderance of all the evidence in that category.
.

25

reason for that is that the regulation requires that the
19

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

The

1

claimant establish the fact in question, and requires that he

2

establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, and that suggests

3

a process of weighing the evidence, of weighing all the like

4

kind evidence and evaluating it.
The regulation may be inartfully drafted to make that

5

6

point, but with six years of consistent interpretation requir­

7

ing proof by a preponderance of the evidence, the reincorpora­

8

tion of precisely the same language in the new regulations

9

should have the same effect as that language in the old regu­

10

lations .

11

The reference to a chest x-ray —

12

QUESTION:

It also is hard to say it more accurately,

13

isn't it?

If you use the plural, the implication would be

14

that even if you showed it by a preponderance, that prepon­

15

derance would have to consist of more than one chest x-ray.
MR. KELLOGG:

16

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

The

17

use of the singular makes clear that a chest x-ray may be

18

sufficient to invoke the presumption, but not that it must be

19

in the face of countervailing more persuasive evidence of the

20

same kind.

21

QUESTION:

NOw, does the agency interpret the plural

22

when it is used in the other sections, such as studies, venti­

23

latory studies, does the preponderance there have to be a

24

preponderance that is composed of more than one study?

25

MR. KELLOGG:

No.

2

QUESTION:

3

That is very unfortunate, because that

is just not consistent with what you have just been saying.
MR. KELLOGG:

4

Well, it is consistent insofar as the

5

reference to studies clearly indicates that all existing

6

studies are to be considered and weighed in the process of

7

determining whether, for example, under Category (b)2 the

8

person has established the existence of a pulmonary impair­

9

ment, or under category (b)3 whether the studies have demon­

10

strated a respiratory disease, and the reference there clearly

11

indicates that there is to be a weighing process, and that more

12

than one study can be relevant, but it has been the consistent

13

interpretation of the director that a single study will

14

suffice in the absence of countervailing studies proving the

15

contrary.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Kellogg, does the true doubt rule

13

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't the doctor's opinion be

14

admissible at the preliminary stage to show that the studies

15

do not in fact establish the conclusion because doctors don't

interpret them that way, just as in reading x-rays the distinc­

17

tion between.the x-ray and the intepretation of the x-ray.

18

The x-ray doesn't establish it unless the sum opinion of all

19

those wholook ed at it, at least the preponderance of that

20

view, supports that conclusion.

21

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, because the (a)2 invocation

22

category relies on specific values.

The tests are given

23

specific values, and if a miner meets those values in a

24

reliable test, then the category is invoked provided there

25

are not other tests of the same sort which preclude

MR. LOWE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

deference.

12

the administrative interpretation be given substantial

interpretation of the regulation found that the agency's inter­

21

who shows that he has been employed in coal mining employment

22

for ten years will have the benefit of the presumption that

24

from that disease if he shows a chest x-ray and a recent

medical opinion under (a)l and (a)4.

granting or ordering x-rays.

the time of the hearing the coal operator will come in and

4

have sent that x-*ray to ten or twelve different doctors and

5

have ten or twelve negative readings.

6

It is not necessary.

But at

So at that time when they are looking to see

7

under (a)1 who wins, it does not become who has the best

11

of evidence then takes the burden off of the coal miner to

12

produce all this substantial amount of evidence.

13

the burden upon the coal operator or the director to rebut

14

those presumptions, and at that point, as the Fourth Circuit

15

had ruled in reviewing all the relevant evidence, then the

16

Court looks at everything that the coal company has put in,

17

and using the director's position, where they say that all

18

like kind evidence will be looked at at (a)l in the invocation

in that the rebuttal was superfluous.

Now, the basic reason that

of the legislative history.

I don't believe it is a conflict

that this is an unusual piece of legislation.

MR. LOWE:

It means one study, Justice, but—

I thought you were urging — it seems to

me that the foundation of your argument is the literal

20

language of the statute that says a chest roentgenogram

22

tory studies.

23

Now, if you are going to be literal, ventilatory

24

studies means more than one.

25

MR. LOWE:

Well, but under the context of the
31

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4688

1

regulation it takes three studies to make one.

You have to --

2

it is a complicated process. Apparently they put them through

3

three tests and you have to submit the results of the three

4

tests and the tracings from the three tests or it will not be

5

accepted.

That is one ventilatory study.
So the Fourth Circuit, and I would agree, saying

6
7

studies just means that you have three studies but that only —

8

that only makes up one ventilatory studies under the regula­

9

tions.

The same thing for blood gas studies.

If you have

10

ever seen a blood gas study, it just has — it has values and

11

numbers, just probably 15 or 20 that all combine to make up

12

that one blood gas study that you apply under the charts under

13

(a)2 and (a)3 to see if you invoke the oresumption.

14

In conclusion —

15

QUESTION:

If the claimant fails to invoke the pre­

interpretation that the minimal amount of evidence you would

have to prove is so low that I believe if you could not even

prove that that your claim would not go any further, because

4

you would not have any evidence at all.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well, isn't there any other way to prove

you have got the disease?

MR. LOWE:

Not under 203(a).

8

QUESTION:

Well, that just goes to whether the

9

MR. LOWE:

10

But under 203 those are the only things

11

that you can offer to prove that you suffer from pneumoconio­

12

sis and that you

are disabled.

QUESTION:

13

I was just reading the government's

14

Footnote 3. "If a claimant is unable to invoke the presumption

15

or the presumption is invoked and rebutted, the claimant may

16

17

two other ways." Then it goes on to tell what it is.
But you suggest that really this is the whole ball

18
19
20

game.
MR. LOWE:

There are other regulations you can turn

21

to, but if you cant' get it here I don't think in reality you

22

are going to get it at all.

23

the Administrative Law Judges' opinions say, we have considered

6

has givena co mmon sense reading to 20 CFR 727.203(a) and (b),

Even if there are ten other x-rays that

support the contrary conclusion?
MR. LOWE:

Supports the contrary, it is our

24

position that your presumption is invoked and then, unlike

25

the director in not being able to look at any other x-ray, we

You

are saying that the one isolated piece of evidence establishes

a presumption that there is the disease.

Yes.

And in addition establishes the presumptio n

MR. LOWE:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

So that it performs two functions under

13

your view.

Under their view it performs only the second

14

function, because you have proved the fact in order to be

15

entitled to the presumption.

That's correct.

MR. LOWE:

And you think the word "establish"

I have difficulty with that.

I am just

That is all I am doing right now.

I would think "establish" means "prove,"

21

and does not set forth a burden of proof of preponderance of

22

the evidence as the director thinks it established.

23

QUESTION:

But do you agree with your opponent's

24

reading of the word "establish" when you are talking about

rebuttal?

No, I do not agree.

QUESTION:

You mean they win with just some

evidence then?

MR. LOWE:

203(b) says in adjudicating a claim

under this subpart, all relevant evidence shall be considered,

7

and I think under (b) that is where the preponderance of the

evidence is established in the head of that subpart.

evidence in the record.

MR. SOLOMONS:

Although it is not terribly relevant

18

to the case, I would like to clear up one misconception about

19

mine operators overwhelming the record with evidence in these

20

cases.

21

In order to generate evidence you have to produce

22

the claimant.

23

take as many examinations or chest x-rays or tests as we want

24

him to.

25

Administrative Law Judges can certainly protect them from

The claimant is not required to do that, and the

MR. SOLOMONS:

Yes, that's right.

They can do that*

Without the claimant's consent.
The claimant can do the same thing,

wins, then we pay for it.

I think that the — with respect to the discussion

I think the critical question lies

For example, the reference to an x-ray is not an

inaccurate reference if that x-ray is the most credible and

reliable piece of evidence or x-ray evidence in the record.

That certainly can establish if the claimant has pneumoconiosis
