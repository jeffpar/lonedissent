CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument this

Mr. Brender, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ART BRENDER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BRENDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question that this case presents is whether or

11
12

not Clara Watson can test her employer's subjective employment

13

practices by disparate impact theory.

14
15
16

We ask the Court to reverse the decision of the 5th
Circuit.
I'd like to discuss some of the pertinent facts and

17

then discuss the five main points or our reasons for asking the

18

Court to reverse this case.

19

Those reasons in summary are that the Griggs v. Duke

20

Power that announced the doctrine of disparate impact did not

21

carve out an exception for subjective practices, that the

22

legislative history of the 1972 amendments to Title VII also

23

endorsed both disparate impact and the prior case law.

24
25

Furthermore, that the EEOC guidelines have applied
disparate impact to subjective practices since at least 1970,
3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

that there is no bright line between objective and subjective

2

practices that the Respondent would have this Court adopt, and,

3

lastly,

4

employers or at least foster employers more use of subjective

5

practices.

that the adoption of this exception would urge

Clara Watson, after having nine years experience as a

6

7

cashier at a Montgomery Wards, applied in 1973 to Fort Worth

8

National Bank as a teller.

9

before she was hired.

She applied actually several times

When she was hired, she was hired not as

10

a teller but as a proof operator.

11

four black employees, none of them in positions that were

12

visible to the public, and the proof operators and the two

13

proof -- I mean printing employees were in the basement and

14

there was a cafeteria employee and a porter.

15

The bank had at that time

After three years on the job, she was made a teller

16

at the bank and then, after seven years on the job, in 1980,

17

she first applied for a position,

for a supervisory position

18

and actually,

there were two supervisory

19

positions that were available; one as the supervisor of the

20

lobby tellers and the other as supervisory of the motor bank

21

tellers.

22

in February of

'80,

She applied for each and in each case, she was

23

refused the job and a white male in one instance, white female

24

in another instance, was selected.

25

two positions became available and she sought both of those

One year later, the same

positions again with the same result.

2

selected for the lobby supervisor and a white male for the

3

motor bank supervisor.

4

A white female was

In 1984, even long after the 1981 refusal, she —

5

there were still no black directors, officers or supervisors at

6

the Fort Worth Bank and Trust, despite the fact that the bank

7

is within a few miles of the two main areas of concentration of

8

the black population in Fort Worth, a city that has about a

9

twenty-two percent black population.

10

The bank system of both hiring and assigning persons

.11

to jobs within the bank was one that relied on the decisions of

12

the supervisors, department supervisors, with very little

13

interference from the upper management.

14

were, of course, all white.

15

Those supervisors

The compensation system that the bank used was a

16

series of — they used evaluations for both supervisory

17

personnel and for line personnel, but those evaluations were

18

filled out by the same supervisors and, once again, all were

19

reviewed by a salary review committee.

20

committee rarely changed or affected the decision of those

21

supervisors.

22

The salary review

The — both the District Court and the Court of

23

Appeals found that this limited group of white department heads

24

made virtually all the hiring and promotion decisions as well

25

as evaluations used to compute compensation and that the upper
5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

management routinely approved those decisions.

2

Clara Watson, at trial, based on a stipulated data

3

base, presented a very comprehensive statistical study which

4

showed that in the area of hiring, blacks were hired at a rate

5

of 3.5 percent while whites were hired at a rate of 14.8

6

percent, almost four times greater, and that figure was

7

disputed somewhat by the bank, who claimed that they only hired

8

people — we used all the applications and all the persons who

9

were hired, they disputed that and said we only hire people

10

whose applications were on file for two weeks.
So, during trial,

11

12

were able to show that that really wasn't true because --

13
14

that was also analyzed, although we

QUESTION:

Well, we don't have a hiring case anymore,

do we?

15

MR. BRENDER:

No, but the same supervisors that were

16

making those hiring decisions were also making the promotion

17

decisions.

18
19

QUESTION:

I mean, all that's left now is the

promotion aspect for an individual plaintiff?
MR. BRENDER:

20

That's correct, although the hiring

21

case actually has been remanded to the District Court where

22

it's still pending.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, but we're not concerned with that

here?
MR. BRENDER:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Brender,

I assume that the proof

2

offered at trial,

3

evidence that would be offered either under a disparate

4

treatment or a disparate impact case.

the statistical evidence,

MR. BRENDER:

5

is exactly the same

I think that's correct, Justice

6

O'Connor. We -- it could be used either way, and I think this

7

Court's footnote in Teamsters says that the matter of proof may

8

be applied to either theory.
QUESTION:

9

And if it were remanded, you wouldn't have

10

different proof, it would still be the same statistical

11

evidence?

12

MR. BRENDER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe so.

So, what is really at stake here?

Does it

14

turn on the different burden of proof aspects under the two

15

types of cases?

16

to rebut the statistics,

17

bottom line?

Does it turn on what the defendant's burden is

MR. BRENDER:

18

in effect?

Is that how you see the

Probably both.

As I see it, to apply

19

statistical evidence under a disparate treatment theory or

20

pattern of practice theory, that the level of proof is greater.

21

This Court has said —

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BRENDER:

24
25

Well, we haven't said that, have we?
Not exactly.

I may be interpreting

that.
QUESTION:

And I'm just wondering if there's any
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

1

difference at all in the initial burden of proof under the two

2

types of cases.

3

MR. BRENDER:

Well, I think there is in this sense,

4

because at least under Castenada v. Partida, where the Court

5

addressed the two or three standard deviation argument on

6

applying an intent theory,

7

Griggs, where you could show under the eighty percent rule, the

8

three-fourths rule, you wouldn't necessarily have to have

9

statistical significance.

10

In other words,

that would be greater than under

two or three standard deviations is

11

either .05 or .01 statistical significance, but the eighty

12

percent rule wouldn't have to come to that level.

13

there would be a difference in terms of statistics.

14

Now,

So,

I think

in fact, our statistics were basically statistic

15

significant.

16

statistically.

17

that in a pattern and practice case,

18

class action because they refuse -- the majority at least

19

refuse to review this under a disparate treatment pattern and

20

practice theory.

21

So, — but I do think there is that difference
The other thing,

in the 5th Circuit held this,
they held it had to be a

There certainly are some cases, and I believe Judge

22

Goldberg cites those in his dissent, where courts have held the

23

statistics are not sufficient in and of themselves to show

24

disparate treatment.

25

QUESTION:

So, the courts below, although you have
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the statistical evidence, decline to even treat it as a pattern

2

and practice case --

3

MR. BRENDER:

4

QUESTION:

5

The —

— because the class was discharged, she

wasn't representative of the class?
MR. BRENDER:

6

I believe that's what they did because

7

they just simply said this was not a — we had disbanded the

8

class or we have upheld the District Court's feeling to that

9

extent, and, but it really wasn't analyzed at all nor, of

10

course, would they allow us to analyze it under the disparate

11

impact.

12

We also —

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Suppose the Court had allowed you, what

would you have done?
MR. BRENDER:

Well, of course, we attempted in the

16

District Court to prove it. We were pointing in that direction,

17

but I don't think we would have — I don't know that we would

18

have done anything different with the statistical evidence.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what would you have done?

You said

20

the court wouldn't let you analyze it under disparate impact.

21

What if it had said okay, go ahead, what would you have done?

22

23

MR. BRENDER:
proof is there.

Oh, okay.

I think the disparate impact

I mean, I think we did present —

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BRENDER:

What would you have said?
Maybe I'm not understanding your

1

question, Justice White, but I
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, how would you — how could you have

won the case?
MR. BRENDER:

4

Oh.

Well, I think it would have then

5

been up to the employer to come forward and justify on business

6

necessity their practices, which they didn't do.

7

attempt to prove business necessity or validation of their

8

processes.
QUESTION:

9
10

So that in disparate impact case, you

really don't need to prove intent, do you?
MR. BRENDER:

11
12

No, no.

You wouldn't have to prove

intent.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRENDER:

15

They did not

And in disparate treatment, you do?
That's correct.

And in this case, they

did not present a statistical case or a statistical expert.
QUESTION:

16

In the disparate impact, is the bottom

17

line, nevertheless, intent in the sense that the employer must

18

justify as in Griggs or what do you conclude, intent or —
MR. BRENDER:

19
20

intent.

21

devoid of intent.

22

I don't believe they have to prove

I think that a disparate impact case can be totally

QUESTION:

But under a pattern and practice case, you

23

don't directly prove intent.

24

of -- from which the trier of fact could infer.

25

MR. BRENDER:

You offer statistics as evidence

Could infer intent.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR, BRENDER:

3

QUESTION:

4

Right?
That's correct.

And in actuality, the proof is much the

same from the plaintiff's side, isn't it?
MR. BRENDER:

5

Well,

I think proof can be used both

6

ways, but I think the disparate impact probably hones in more

7

on the group discrimination, whereas, you know, -QUESTION:

8
9

My impression is that the plaintiff's

initial proof would be exactly the same and what you might be

10

quibbling about is what the defendant's burden then is under

11

the two types, and I guess we haven't spoken to that, really.
MR. BRENDER:

12

No.

The only disagreement I have with

13

that is a lot of the language in the disparate -- in the

14

pattern and practice cases talks about a pervasive all invasive

15

system of discrimination and so forth that's intent, and I

16

interpret that to mean you've got to basically show statistical

17

evidence of intent at every stage of the process; whereas,

18

think under disparate impact, you can simply show that the

19

overall result is disproportionate and then the employer must

20

come in and justify those.
QUESTION:

21

22

And he justifies it by showing job-

related .

23

MR. BRENDER:

24

QUESTION:

25

I

That's correct.

So, he doesn't rebut any notion of intent

directly.
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. BRENDER:

1

No, no.

He could rebut the case by

2

trying to show that there is no impact.

3

could come in and try to -QUESTION:

4

In other words, he

Or he could show, as I understand it, that

5

even if there is an impact, there is a job-related reason for

6

giving it.
MR. BRENDER:

7X

That's right. Either by validating it

8

under the procedures set out in the EEO guidelines or by simply

9

showing that it's necessary to the efficient operation of the

10

11

business.
QUESTION:

And if he fails to do that, he's liable

12

not because he intends anything, but because as the law is

13

interpreted, intended to give relief —

14

MR. BRENDER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRENDER:

That's right.

Griggs, I guess.
That's Griggs, Your Honor.

Griggs says

17

that by the effect of the impact, he must then come in and

18

justify those practices.

19

practices, then he's liable.

20

with the practice and he's not liable despite the impact.

21

QUESTION:

If he's unable to justify those
If he is, then he can continue on

Mr. Brender, may I just -- I'm not

22

entirely clear on what you think the employer has to show in a

23

case in which the practice being challenged is the practice of

24

using subjective discretionary approach by the supervisors at

25

each branch office.
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

You say you proved statistically that this has

resulted in discriminatory impact.

3

justify that?

4

necessary for him to use discretionary —

Does he have to prove that he must, that it's

MR. BRENDER:

5

How can the employer

Justice Stevens, I think he can do it

6

several ways.

I think that — and the courts have addressed

7

those.

8

of course, we have cited and talked about the brief of the APA

9

which shows that contrary to what is being argued by the

First, he can validate under the EEOC guidelines and,

10

Respondent, subjective procedures are validated.

11

legitimate ways in which you can validate those type of

12

criteria.

13

The other way —

14

QUESTION:

There are

By that, do you mean you validate each

15

factor that the local manager uses or validate the practice of

16

using multi-factor discretion?

17

MR. BRENDER:

I'm a little puzzled.

I think one problem with the facts of

18

this case is that the subjective -- I don't know whether it's

19

subjective process being used, but there was really no criteria

20

that was out there for which the supervisors were supposed to

21

make decisions.

22

But I think — so, that system that they were using,

23

I think, is kind of far out from where a general subjective

24

hiring practice decision may be or promotion practice,

25

whatever, but I think that — for instance, the practice that
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

2

they had, which was kind of a gut-level system, I want to —
QUESTION:

The people who were familiar with the

3

employees in the best position to make a judgment as to which

4

would be the best supervisor, and there's really no way to

5

prove that that's a necessary way to hire people, is it?

6

MR. BRENDER:

Well, I think there is, but I think you

7

could also validate it.

In other words, you could simply take

8

-- for instance, one way you could validate this system would

9

simply be to take upper management and say okay, give us a

10

series of fact situations that you would want your supervisor

11

--- the supervisors would handle, from routine things, like a

12

social security check doesn't get credited, to things like, for

13

instance, attempted forgery.

14

how a successful supervisor would deal with those in a way that

15

we can rate those things in terms of knowledge of the job,

16

knowledge of the bank procedures, knowledge of maybe the law in

17

some instances, the speed with which they resolve them, and

18

those sorts of things.

19

Give us those situations, tell us

And then what you do is you simply take the two

20

groups, you have the group —

21

QUESTION:

It seems to me you're saying don't do it

22

on a subjective basis, that you must have a series of objective

23

criteria that can be reviewed.

24
25

MR. BRENDER:

Only to validate, only to validate. In

other words, if you go through that processs, you take and you
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

test the people who are the successful people,

the supervisors,

2

and then you test those who are the applicants but did not

3

succeed, and you find that there is a statistical difference on

4

the side of those who are selected.
In other words, you find that they are -- they were,

5
6

in fact, selected properly, then you. could continue on with

7

your gut-level system.

In other words, that only applies --

8

QUESTION:

9

why, then, you're in trouble.

10

And if you find they made a few mistakes,

MR. BRENDER:

If you made some mistakes, you're going

11

to have to either find an alternative process or put in some

12

criteria in this case that would —
QUESTION:

13
14

mistakes?

15

this.

And these are all by hypotheses innocent

I mean there is no racial animus motivating any of

16

MR. BRENDER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

There wouldn't have to be,

Well,

I mean,

if you can prove racial

animus, you don't need any of this theory.
MR. BRENDER:

Well,

if you don't — as I see

20

disparate impact, you could have racial animus.

21

imply intent or lack of intent.

22

QUESTION:

That doesn't

Mr, Brender, the sort of system that you

23

suggest for validating in response to Justice Stevens' question

24

may be find for a company like the Fort Worth Bank, and Trust

25

Company that has a number of employees.

How about an employer

15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

who employs just a minimum number that's subject to Title VIX?

2

Is he supposed to go through all of that, too?

3

MR, BRENDER:

4

QUESTION:

5

First of all, --

What is it, fifteen people or twenty

people?
MR. BRENDER:

6

First of all, Your Honor, I think the

7

thing we've got to realize is that you have to be able to show

8

impact first, and I do think in smaller employers, it's going

9

to be difficult to show an impact simply because of the number

10

of decisions would not be sufficient to show statistically that

11

there's an impact.
But assuming that you could do it, there are other

12
13

ways to validate.

That would not be the only way.

You could

14

QUESTION:

15

What would a small employer of twenty

16

people, how could he validate, you know, that sort of

17

subjective system that I think most of those employers probably

18

use?

19

MR. BRENDER:

I think, first of all, there are the

20

transportability provisions to the guidelines.

21

things that say — for instance, a bank teller's job is not

22

that much different than a bank teller's job anywhere else.

23

You can take studies that have already been done.

24
25

QUESTION:

Those are

But even an employer of twenty people

would have to go to studies and that sort of thing.
16

3

MR. BRENDER:

Only if, only if they have a disparate

impact.
QUESTION:

Of course, he doesn't know at any given

4

time whether his practices may be shown to have a disparate

5

impact or not.

6

I take it that doesn't depend on intent.

MR. BRENDER:

Well, it doesn't depend on intent, but

7

he is under the guidelines required to be looking at his

3

practices and aware of his practices under the provisions of

9

self-help provisions of the guidelines, where an employer is

10

encouraged to try to eliminate racial bias or racial effects in

1 1

his employment practices.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Brender, isn't there something

13

short of this so-called validation that would suffice to

14

determine or establish that a particular employer's system of

15

evaluating or promoting employees is generally fair and

16

uniformly applied?

17
18

19

It seems to me there is a body of case law out there
to that effect.
MR. BRENDER:

There is, and we have cited some of

20

those cases in our reply brief, where courts have simply held

21

that on different sorts of things, one of them that comes to

22

mind is the Zahorik v. Cornel] University, where their process

23

of assessing people for tenure was found to be — to satisfy

24

business necessity.

25

QUESTION:

I mean, you would concede, I suppose, that
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

for supervisory and managerial positions,

2

possible to always use subjective standards in hiring,

3

there will almost always be a subjective component in hiring

4

and promotional decisions for that kind of job.

5

MR. BRENDER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BRENDER:

it probably isn't
that

Well, T think there's —

Isn't that right?
I think, that's true.

I think

8

however. I do think that you can narrow subjective things.

9

don't think there's a fine line between subjective and

10

I

objective.

11

For instance, by their definition, a test would be

12

objective, but an essay test could be very, very subjective.

13

By the same token, things like personal appearance, which were

14

on the rating form that they used and they had what they termed

15

was a professionally-developed form which they just simply

16

didn't use for promotions, but that can be very, very

17

objectively determined.

18

what this case addressed in -- this Court addressed in

19

Albemarle, that if the criteria are set out and they are

20

specific,

21

think attempts -- some of the case law simply attempts to try

22

to get at narrower and more objective standards, have been held

23

to be justified by business necessity, and the same thing with

regard to the other factor that the Respondent raises about

cost studies.

If the criteria are set out, that's

it really narrows subjectivity considerably, and I

that certain things in the interview are really relevant,

they're looked at and those relevant factors are applicable in

18

the job requirements, and then design the application or the

interview form so that it goes to those behaviors, and that's

not terribly costly to do one of those type studies.

have to be incurred

after there's an impact, after there's an adverse impact shown.

Much of Petitioner's account of this case today is

or methods of proof that the Petitioner seeks today are quite

9

clear and have a dramatic effect on this case.

10

On the one hand,

the case was tried under the

11

disparate treatment method, which is the McDonnell Douglas,

12

Furnco, Burdine method of proof. The court, applying 5th

13

Circuit precedent, applied those tests and determined that the

14

Petitioner had made a prima facie case of her claim of racial

15

discrimination, but that the bank had articulated a reasonable

16

legitimate excuse, a reason for its actions --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. McGEE:

What was that?
They described four different reasons for

19

the non-selection.

20

court determined that the bank chose Mr. Burt over Ms. Watson

21

because of considerations of his experience, his previous

22

supervisory experience, his close working relationship with Mr.

23

Shipp, who was the bank's operation officer at that time.

24

Also, his greater or better qualifications than Ms. Watson.

25

With the case of the first selection,

With regard to the second decision,

that being the

27

(202} 628-4888

the

1

one where Ms. Cullar was chosen as the motor hank supervisor,

2

the same types of considerations were made.

3

concluded that Mr. Burt had a greater opinion of Ms. Cullar's

4

qualifications than those of Ms. Watson and that those reasons

5

were not pretext for discrimination.

The court

Likewise, with the other two selections, the same

type of considerations were made and the same type of

8

determinations was made.

9

in each case, but they were similar. They were all these

The qualifications were not identical

That highlights the distinction between the disparate

14

treatment, no proof of intent or motivation, but would rather

15

require only that the Petitioner here show that there was a

16

disproportionate representation of blacks in the bank's work

17

force.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. McGee,

it seems to me the

19

initial proof would be the same under the statistics, under

20

either theory.

21

MR. McGEE:

(202)

628-4888

I mean, I'm

1

has to show in these cases under the two theories.
MR. McGEE:

2

As I read Griggs and those that follow,

3

there is a requirement that the Petitioner or that the

4

Plaintiff point out a specific facially-neutral arbitrary-type

5

of standard or requirement that causes the impacts complained

6

of.

That's not been done here.

7

So, under my theory or my view of this case, the

8

Petitioner would still lose because she has never made her

9

prima facie case, but the trial court could and very well

10

likely would conclude that they had and then would put us to

11

validating our entire selection process without ever having

12

been pointed to the one specific point in that selection

13

process that caused the impact.

14

I don't think that that validation can be done.

What

15

the APA talks about as validation are really objective-cation

16

of a subjective system, which is quite a long ways from

17

validating the bank's selection system.

18

The trial court found that the bank was absolutely

19

free of any racial discriminatory intent or motivation.

20

selects — it uses and has selected a process which it believes

21

best serves its needs, its legitimate business needs, as an

22

employer, and there was —

23

QUESTION:

Well, not necessarily.

It

It may be wrong.

24

I mean, isn't the big difference between validation under the

25

impact test and what you

urge be applied here, isn't the big
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

difference that the employer,

2

under Griggs, he has to be right?

3

the reason he failed to hire this individual has to be not

4

merely something that has nothing to do with racial

5

discrimination or any other unlawful discrimination, but it has

6

to be correct.

7

MR. McGEE:

8

QUESTION:

9

if he's using an objective test
He has to be not merely —

That is correct.
Whereas, under your theory, this bank

would be entirely entitled to put the wrong people in the

10

position, so long as they didn't pick the wrong people because

11

of racial animus or sex animus.
MR. McGEE:

12
13

Obviously, errors can occur and we would

submit that we have the right to make those errors.
QUESTION:

14

You're not asserting that you established

15

below or that the Court thought you established below that, in

16

fact, your system's a good one, that you're picking the best

17

people?

18

but whatever is terrible about it had nothing to do with racial

19

or sexual animus.

20
21

All the Court really found is that it may be terrible,

MR. McGEE:

That's correct. The system was not on

trial at the District Court.

defense?
MR. McGEE:

Well, the difference is, Justice Stevens,

10

that with the facially-neutral objective re uirements, there is

11

a uniform or automatic dis ualification of certain people.

12

It's applied across the board. But in our — my client's

13

employment system, each selection, each of these four

14

selections that are involved in this case, were done on an

15

individua1 basis.
The criteria differed to some extent in each case.

There was no automatic dis ualification.

MR. McGEE:

This Court has provided an ade uate

(202)

method for challenging that type of result.

2

practice tests that are referred to in McDonnell Douglas and

3

Justice Powell's opinion make clear that an individual can show

4

that the employer's procedure or practices in carrying on its

5

business are evidence of racial intent itself, and if they are

6

sufficiently great of the type you described, I feel certain

7

that the Plaintiff would be able to obtain a finding that, in

8

fact, any reasons offered by the Defendant were, in fact, a

9

pretext for his racially-discriminatory intention.

10

The pattern and

If my client is found wrong here today, even though

11

he’s not -- he's been found not to have any racial intention or

12

any discriminatory intention or motivation, the result will not

13

be that he — that it switches to an objective system for

14

making its promotional decisions.

15

objective tests because we don't believe that any tests exist

16

today which will give my client the type of decisions they

17

choose and we don't believe that they can be formulated or

18

devised in any time in the foreseeable future at a cost that

19

would be acceptable to my client.

20

It will, instead, not go to

But what my client will continue to do is to make the

21

subjective decisions that it has in the past because it

22

believes this is the best and most fair way to satisfy its

23

legitimate business need to supply itself with employers and

24

supervisors, rather, who are the best qualified.

25

But what it will be forced to do to protect itself in
33

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

the future is to overlay on that subjective system a numerical

2

quota system, and I do not believe that this is what the

3

Congress intended when it enacted Title VII.
The subjective system that is challenged sounds, on

4
5

the basis of the briefs on the Petitioner's side, to be maybe a

6

little bit sloppy and somewhat inferior, and particularly when

7

you have thrown up on the other side the concept of objective

8

tests, which have the sound of being scientific and fair, but,

9

really, the decisions that are being made at my client's place

of business are the types of decisions that are made all over

this country by employers of all sizes, particularly those that
are smaller,

like my client, but all employers.

his judgments on promotion based upon his view of what is most

important to him, who best typifies those criteria and those

traits which he thinks are most important to his business

decisions.

9

The experience that the employer has with dealing

20

with these people who are applicants for promotion puts him in

21

the best position to determine who has the characteristics,

I've heard argument in other cases bemoaning the difficulty of

validating an objective test and what many employers in that

is more or less balanced by race, by sex, and so forth.

9

had a history of drug use, Teale that dealt with a written

But opposed to those type of cases are the McDonnell

11

12

Douglas, the Furnco, the Aikens and the Burdine cases, which

13

recognize a different set of proof and a different set of

fac ts.

15

The situation in McDonnellDouglas was an individual

16

who complained that he was not hired because of his

17

participation -- was not hired because of his race.

18

articulated by the employer was that he was not hired or not

19

rehired because of his participation in illegal activities.

20

The reason

The Court held and pointed out the distinction

21

between that type of an articulated reason that is subjective

22

and inherently unique to the employer as opposed to those which

23

were present in Griggs which had the effect of disqualifying

24

large groups of people automatically, and I think that's the

25

key to the distinction between McDonnellDouglas and Griggs, is
37

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(205)

628-4888

1

that, on the one hand, you have these objective artificial

2

rules which disqualify large groups of people, regardless of

3

consideration of their individual qualifications, where, with

4

McDonnellDouglas, you have a consideration of qualifications.

5

Here,

in my case, the bank recognized that Clara

6

Watson was fully qualified for the job she sought or at least

7

possessed the minimum qualifications as well as did others.

Some of the selections that were involved here today, there

QUESTION:

17

MR. McGEE:

Well,

it shouldn't be too long.

In 1978, when the uniform guidelines were

adopted, they had the view that subjective selection processes,

19

such as present here, might not be verifiable or validateable

and,

21

which comments to the uniform guidelines suggest would be under

the disparate treatment theory as announced in McDonnell

QUESTION:

MR. McGEE:

Objective and subjective.

Yes, sir.

And

4

the '78 guidelines were seen as a response to the complaints of

5

the APA and other professionals that they were basically

6

unachievable goals and objectives and put the defendant, the

7

employer, in the position of basically being out of compliance

8

automatically, and that is the reason for the '78 guidelines

9

and why the EEOC supports our position here today.

10

The -- one other thing that I'd like to point out in

11

response to a question to Mr. Brender, the numbers in this case

12

do not make disparate impact an appropriate method of proof.

You know, one time I had a case where they

MR. McGEE:

I think all of the positions, including the position that you

The subjective selections that my client uses are not

the Petitioner.

They are no different than the type of

selection process that Justice Stevens referred to with his law

clerks.

24

If, for instance, Justice Stevens determined that he

42

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

wanted to choose among the law clerks he had which one that he

2

would retain for that second term, he's going to necessarily

3

rely upon his intuitive subjective judgment as to which one is

4

the best qualified, will most fulfill his needs as a law clerk,

5

and I think it's just ludicrous to suggest that Justice Stevens

6

should have to hire an industrial psychologist to devise some

7

form of test so that his decisions can be validated so as he

8

can avoid a claim of discriminatory impact.

Actually,

that's a bad example.

That

would be easy to validate. You would pick the masochist, I

think.

No. I was going to say if I did that,

maybe I'd have better law clerks.

MR. McGEE:

That's important.

QUESTION:

We won't quote you.

Company for subjective hiring and promotion practices under the

Their guidelines for eighteen years have required

3

that subjective practices be treated under the disparate impact

4

theory and the questions and answers that are supposed to guide

5

employers in applying the guidelines state that, too, and we

have that in our reply brief.
There's no difference between the provisions that the

Respondent cites for subjective procedures and the ones for
