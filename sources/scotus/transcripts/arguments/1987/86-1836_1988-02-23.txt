ORAL ARGUMENT BY ALAN MANSFIELD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR.' MANSFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

11

the Court, this case presents a classic conflict between

12

competing American values, the fundamental ricrh't of our

13

citizens to associate, elect who their friends will be in

14

places which are private social settings and the state's

IS

interest in providing equal opportunities for people in places

16

which are public.

17

To foster equal opportunity, places like New York

18

City and other jurisdictions throughout the countrv have

19

enacted public accommodations laws.

20

again which are truly public prohibit discrimination, but to

21

secure the personal liberties which are basic to our society

22

and which permit social clubs to exist in the first instance,

23

New York City's lav/, like many other jurisdictions, exempts

24

private clubs from the definition of place of public

25

accommodation.

These laws in places

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This exemption strikes a fair balance between the

2

coirroetincr values to associate on one hand and the state's

3

interest in antidiscrimination orinciples on the other.

Law 63 is an amendment to New York City's public accommodations

14

opponent in the case savs that it doesn't create an

15

irrebuttable presumption but rather a presumption that then

16

has the effect of, I guess, shifting the burden of proof but

17

leaving it open to the clubs to nonetheless show by any means

18

that they are indeed private.

19

MR. MANSFIELD:

I notice that is what you are

Certainlv your

^he Corporation Counsel's brief

20

in fact takes that position now for the first time.

21

at the Court of Appeals decision itself, however, I think,

22

makes auite clear that for purposes of a club which is claiming

23

a right to private association, that club is bound by an

24

irrebuttable presumption.

25

Looking

The context in which the Court of Appeals was

writing was NYSCA's challenge under the state constitutional

were inconsistent with the general law of the State of New

provision which is also a public accommodation statute, and

6

it has a distinctly private exemption, just like the old

7

New York City law did.

8

Mew York State has a statute which is a statewide

had construed that exemption.

NYSCA argued below that the

14

factors, and since they were permissive, then another juris­

15

diction would be free to pass consistent provisions, and the

16

Court of Appeals held that the three pronas were consistent.

17

The critical point here, though, is that or

18

purposes of determining that a club is not distinctly

19

private, a trier of fact sitting in the City Human Rights

20

Commission is entitled to look at as many factors as he

21

or she wishes.

22

once a club meets the three prongs, it is deemed to be not

23

entitled to the distinctly private exemption.

25

To that extent indeed it is permissive, but

the language of the statute could not be more clear.

The

So the effect of the ordinance is

that case by case determination of constitutionality in

10

MR. MANSFIELD:

It is precluded.

Once-a cldb

12

city law if it discriminates in any fashion.

13

The purpose again of the private club exemption

14

was to strike that fair balance between competing American

values.

16

based on these three factors.

Local Law 63 is in fact an irrebuttable presumption

QUESTION:

17

When you say irrebuttable presumption

18

you really mean that the law means what it says, I guess,

19

that when these three factors are present the law shall be

20

such and such.

21

MR. MANSFIELD:

That is exactly correct.

like that.

The

i

all kinds, and some will be impacted by it, some won't.,

2

point here, however, is that the analytical framework for a

3

club's exercise of its freedom of association has set forth

4

in two of the decisions of this Court, first in Roberts and

5

later in Rotary, just last term, this Court without dissent

6

set forth the proper analytical framework, and that framework

7

said that a club should be able to demonstrate and a trier of

8

fact should carefully assess all of the objective character­

9

istics which would be relevant to determine whether a club is

10

or is not private.

11

The Court went on in both of those decisions to

12

identify the kinds of factors which should be considered.

13

Those factors included the purpose of a club.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But neither of those opinions purported

to be drafting manuals for statutes.
MR. MANSFIELD:

However, I

think that both of those opinions were settinq forth a

constitutional framework.

20

freedom to associate can attach, and the fact that a private

21

club may under some circumstances be entitled to exercise

22

that freedom to associate, that members of that club have

the right to choose who their friends will be free of

24

government regulation, free of government scrutinv of the

membership policies and operations of the club.

Because in any single case — there

is no case you can imaqine where this law could be

MR. MANSFIELD:

It, too, would be a relevant

factor.
QUESTION:

Can you imagine no case in which those

13

three relevant factors would combine to result in a non­

14

private status for a club?

15

MR. MANSFIELD: Well, it is conceivable that there

16

is a class of cases in which a club, for example, like the

17

Rotaries or the JCs under any test, even if one employs a

18

fundamentally wrong premise, would have the same result,

19

that doesn't make the test any more constitutional, much

20

like in the Court's decisions in Munson and Schaumburg.

21

In Munson and Schaumburg,, it is conceivable there would have

22

been those out there trying to solicit funds who were

23

encraged in fraudulent charitable activities , so the over­

24

broad lav; as applied to that class of indivdiuals would have

the same result as if the law were more narrowly fashioned.

QUESTION:

Thei~e are ——

We are assuming no overbreadth here.

3

mean, that's — I thought this whole discussion was on the

4

assumption of no overbreadth principle applicable.

5

MR. MANSFIELD:

I

The Court has used overbreadth in

6

two distinct contexts, as Justice Brockman pointed out in the

7

Munson case, both that the law is unconstitutional with

8

respect to the facts that are set forth by the plaintiff and

9

also in the classic sense of overbreadth where even if the

10

law properly regulates the conduct of plaintiff, nevertheless

11

there are others whose rights will be chilled.

12

And indeed we make the challenge to this law on

13

both grounds, but with respect to the class of clubs repre­

14

sented bv the

wing of the freedom to associate is the freedom for expressive

together, of political organizations to get together which are

clearly protected under the expressive association cases,

MR. MANSFIELD:

I think the Court has in the oast

talked about the freedom of association protecting not only

17

the direct advancement of beliefs but in Coats versus City

18

of Cincinnati the Court mentioned that social expression was

eoually protected.

or any nationwide organization with

We never talk about intimate association as far as
political belief is concerned', do we?
MR. MANSFIELD:

Well, that is correct, Your Honor.

19

There are two prongs of the freedom of association.

20

Roberts and in Rotary, both of those clubs were analvzed under

21

both prongs, the first, the right to private association, a

22

right which derives out of the liberty clause of the

23

Constitution; the second was a right of expressive association,

24

which finds its roots more directly in First Amendment cases.

that is a construction of this ordinance, isn't it?

MR. MANSFIELD:

Now,

I believe it is not a construction

of the ordinance.

sistent with the Roberts analysis for determining that a club

MR. MANSFIELD:

The Court of Appeals said that

MR. ZIMROTH:

concede that the opinion is not crystal clear about that, but

this was after all a facial attack, and what the Court had

criteria that is directly related to what this Court had

previously said in the JC case and in the Rotary case.

It looked at the City of New York.

It had very

16

extensive hearings about the nature of these clubs that had

17

very, very substantial business operations.

18

the University Club estimated that more than half of the income

19

from that fund came from nonmembers. We are talking about

20

clubs that have millions and millions of dollars of income

21

from nonmembers, clubs that actually advertise to its members

saying, please use this club more for business purposes.

there are certainly plenty of clubs to which this law could

MR. ZIMROTH:

You could still say that, well,

I think that's correct. That is what

I am trying to say, that is, if you look at the real life
