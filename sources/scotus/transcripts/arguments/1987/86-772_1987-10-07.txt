ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. WILSON

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. WILSON:

Thank you.

This proceeding, brought

10

under Section 1983, involves the imposition of municipal

11

liability upon the Petitioner for the single isolated act of a

12

city official who lacked general authority in the area and

13

whose action was contrary to the policy of the city.

14

This is a Monell type case. In Monell, this Court

15

indicated that it was going to leave to future decisions the

16

full contours of municipal liability.

17

respect to single incidents that this Court has shaped those

18

contours in its decisions in cases such as Owens, Tuttle, and

19

particularly the recent Pembaur decision.

20

proceeding calls for is an application of those principles to

21

the facts herein.

22

It is our position in

The facts are largely undisputed.

And what this

The Plaintiff was

23

a civil service employee of the City of St. Louis.

24

planner for our community development commission.

25

he became embroiled in a dispute with his supervisor. This led

He was a
Around 1980,

to a 15-day suspension for violation of the secondary

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

employment rule.

He appealed to our Civil Service Commission

2

which reduced that to a reprimand.
In April 1981, because of a change of

3

4

administrations, the new mayor appointed a Defendant Frank

5

Hamsher as the head of the community development agency.

6

Approximately one year later, Mr. Hamsher, as director of that

7

agency, transferred the Plaintiff to another City department.

8

He filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission.

9

Civil Service Commission declined that appeal on the basis that

10

no injury was done to him at that time since this was a lateral

11

transfer.

The

Subsequent to that, the Plaintiff filed a 1983 action

12
13

naming three City officials and the City as Defendants.

14

Defendant Hamsher was one of those named.
The Plaintiff was subsequently laid off from his

15
16

position some 17 months after the transfer.

He took an appeal

17

from that layoff and that appeal has been deferred awaiting the

18

outcome of this proceeding.

19

We believe the question is whether or not the acts of

20

the Defendant Hamsher in transferring the Plaintiff fall within

21

the language of Monell which imposes liability for acts which

22

can be said to fairly represent governmental policy.

23

Now, the court below, the trial court rendered

24

through a jury verdict a judgment against the City of

25

St. Louis.

It exonerated the three individual defendants. The

Court of Appeals in its opinion determined that the jury had

Heritage

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

found that the act of transfer was a retaliatory act on the

2

part of Defendant Hamsher and he was impermissibly motivated

3

and caused constitutional injury to the Plaintiff who had been

4

exercising his right of First Amendment by appealing to the

5

Civil Service Commission.

6

The Eighth Circuit determined that the Defendant

7

Hamsher was a policy maker and his action, therefore, in

8

transferring the Plaintiff bound the City of St. Louis so that

9

Monell type liability was imposed upon the City as a policy

10

11

maker.
It is our position that the crux of this matter

12

involves the distinction between a City official who has the

13

discretion to act. In this case, the discretion to hire and

14

fire and transfer employees as opposed to the authority of a

15

policy maker.

16

employment policy for the City of St. Louis.

17

In this case, it would be the authority to set

Clearly, the Defendant Hamsher had the former:

the

18

discretionary power to hire, fire and transfer employees.

19

nowhere in the record is there presented any evidence that the

20

Defendant Hamsher was a policy maker for purposes of setting

21

the employment policy of the City of St. Louis.

22

The Court of appeals misconstrued Pembaur.

But

They

23

adopted in their opinion what has been labeled the final

24

authority test, which the court said was a two-pronged test to

25

determine Monell liability.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wilson, may I ask you a question

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

before you get into the more details?

2

MR. WILSON:

3

QUESTION:

yes.
Is it your view that the question whether

4

a particular agent of the City is a policy making official is a

5

question of fact or a question of law?

6

MR. WILSON:

7

QUESTION:

Clearly, a question of law.
So, then it doesn't — and you point is

8

that regardless of what the evidence was, since he didn't — I

9

mean it was with regard to a particular transaction, he Could

10
11
12
13

not qualify?
MR. WILSON:

Yes, that would be correct.

The record

does not support any imposition of liability upon the City.
QUESTION:

And the judge shouldn't have even given

14

the jury the instruction, "If you find him to be a policy

15

making official."

16

MR. WILSON:

That is correct.

17

reached that point.

18

was made under these facts.

19

QUESTION:

They should have never

We do not believe that a submissible case

Well, Mr. Wilson, the jury was instructed

20

that they could determine in effect whether the named

defendants were policy makers; were they not?

MR. WILSON:

That was part of

MR. WILSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. WILSON:

Yes, that's correct.

But now you say that was wrong?
Yes.

The instructions were totally

4

inadequate, but what we are presenting here and what we have

5

preserved is the error in overruling our motions for directed

6

verdicts which we made at each critical stage in respect to the

7

sufficiency of the evidence to impose under any proper standard

8

liability —

9

QUESTION:

Was there evidence in the record from

10

which the jury might have concluded that the mayor or a member

11

of the mayor's cabinet or council had approved the transfer

12

knowing that it was in retaliation for —

13

MR. WILSON:

Well, the jury would have had to follow

14

the instructions, I think.

15

instruction only named the three defendants, Hamsher and two

16

other supervisors.

17

And the verdict directing

It did not name the mayor —

QUESTION:

Well, I asked you whether there was

18

evidence in the record from which a jury might have concluded

19

that the mayor or member of his council or cabinet had approved

20

the transfer knowing it was in retaliation?

21

MR. WILSON:

There is nothing in -— my interpretation

22

of the record, there is nothing in there that would support

23

that inference. There is some allusions to the mayor.

24

there is an allusion that the mayor knew that there was a

25

transfer of functions from one department to another, but that

I think

was different than having knowledge particularly of this

1

Plaintiff. So, our answer would be no, although the mayor was

2

never named in a verdict director by the Plaintiff in this

3

particular instance.
We believe that the test of the final — the final

4
5

authority test at the Eighth Circuit placed in its opinion is

6

erroneous.

7

to act, I think may be categorized as discretion.

8

Court made clear in Pembaur in Part 2(b) that discretion is not

9

enough to impose liability.

10
11
12

It is contrary to Pembaur.

The delegated authority
And this

If I may quote:

"The official must be responsible for establishing
final government policy respecting such activity."
Aside from the being contrary to Pembaur, the test

13

promoted by the Eighth Circuit in its opinion is unreasonable.

14

The question of delegating out authority is one that runs

15

throughout all of City officialdom in employment.

16

conduct business without delegating out discretion to employees

17

all the way down the line.

18

We could not

Also, the second part of the test, the lack of

apparatus to provide review.

25

There are Countless

There would have

We believe the test is totally unreasonably, but the
main point is that it is contrary to the opinions -— most of

identification of a policy maker.

And the policy maker

Here I believe you have a contrast in Pembaur between

7

the official who was held liable and the Defendant Hamsher, who

we assert should not have been considered to be a policy maker.

Mr. Wilson, as the case comes to us, I

21

gather that the argument that there is a policy maker here is

that it is Hamsher?

Yes.

construed the jury verdict to be:

MR. WILSON:

No.

The Respondent has abandoned the

12

Eighth Circuit decision in respect to the test, the final

13

authority test.

14

the Eighth Circuit determination and what the jury did was find

15

that Frank Hamsher made an impermissibly motivated

unconstitutional act by reason of retaliatory transfer.

believe anticipated exactly the fact situation we have there.

The Court in that opinion hypothesized a county sheriff, a

hypothetical county sheriff who, while being the chief law

20

enforcement officer, received rules and regulations in respect

21

to employment from the County Board of Commissioners.

22

hypothetical, that county sheriff, if he committed an

23

unconstitutional act in respect to his employees, it would not

24

impose liability upon the county; although, if he acted in

respect to his function as chief law enforcement officer,
liability would be imposed.

Who was the policy maker in your view in

The Civil Service Commission.
They set the rules of the game about

hiring and firing and transferring?

MR. WILSON:

Yes.

We have a charter amendment that

been recognized —

And people like Hamsher are just — are

supposed to take acts consistent with that policy?

MR. WILSON:

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Mr. Wilson, if your view is correct, why

16

wouldn't it be in the interest of every municipality to confer

17

all policy making authority for everything upon one individual,

18

say, the mayor.

19

certainly.

20

really making policy; but he doesn't know what those policies

21

are in fact.

22

So, then there would be no municipal policy on any of these

23

things established by the only person authorized by law to

24

establish them and there would never be any 1983 liability.

25

Isn't that what everybody ought to do?

And he can't possibly execute it all,

So, de facto, a lot of people beneath the mayor are

14

then I think there is a third type of liability which I would

call single incident liability.

Now, we are separating out the types of Monell

And

Under Pembaur, I think the threshold question is who

is a policy maker and that, we would believe, is purely a

question of law.

20

issues for a jury.

Liability would exist whether or not the policy

I think that is an open question. And I

think the Fifth Circuit, which rendered an opinion on this
13

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

particular issue felt that constructive knowledge was enough in

2

that instance to impose liability, constructive knowledge on

3

the part, even though the Fifth Circuit is clearly in conflict

4

with our present decision from the Eighth Circuit because they

5

abandoned what we categorize as the final authority test.
I think the key here is, unlike the prosecutor in

6

7

Pembaur, Hamsher had substantive constraints upon the scope of

8

his employment decisions.

The dissent in the Eighth Circuit I

«

9

think captured the significance of these restraints in our

10

appendix to our petition.

11

the Civil Service rules permit appointing authorities

12

discretion in making personnel decisions, but do not grant them

13

the power to set personnel policy.

MR. WILSON:

The judge stated, Judge Ross stated

but that's all right.

13

MR. WILSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WILSON:

You are just not accepting my hypothesis,

If I may, Justice White?
Go ahead.
If there was a delegation of authority,

16

if it was a lawful delegation, I think you are going to have

17

difficulty finding lawful delegations of authority.

18

assuming there was lawful delegation from the policy maker to

19

another city official, then that city official would take on

20

the responsibilities of a policy maker under Monell.

21

QUESTION:

But,

Well, what if a lower ranking city

22

official assumes the responsibility for making decisions that

23

could be interpreted as policy decisions?

24

circumstances in which the city could be found liable for the

25

exercise of those decisions?

Now, are there

For example, if higher authority

knows or should have known about those actions of lower ranking

employees?
MR. WILSON:

I think in respect to single incidents,

3

we would say, no, unless the Civil Service Commission in this

4

instance would have had actual knowledge that the transfer was

5

impermissibly motivated.

6

QUESTION:

Or constructive knowledge?

7

MR. WILSON:

We would say that there would be

8

clearly, no liability in that particular case.

Now, if you get

9

into a widespread practice over a passage of time that is open

10

and notorious, there we have the question that I think I

11

attempted to answer with Judge Scalia, their constructive

12

knowledge could operate to impose municipal liability, but not

13

in respect to a single incident, unless the policy maker —

14

QUESTION:

What if what is open and notorious is not

15

the particular policy that has been adopted by the delegee, the

16

de facto delegee?

17

fact of delegation.

18

Commission is not making the policies, that it is allowing

19

people out there to establish their own policies.

20

is open and notorious?

21

the fact that the mayor or the Civil Service Commission is not

22

running the show.

23

But what is open and notorious is merely the

MR. WILSON:

Merely the fact that the Civil Service

Not the nature of each policy, but just

If, again, we're in the second category,

24

25

acquiesence by the policy maker.
QUESTION:

In the mere

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

delegation, not in the particular policies adopted.
MR. WILSON:

2

In the mere delegation?

No.

We would

3

say not. We would say, again, you would have to look at the

4

state law.

5

satisfy what we understand the test of Pembaur, the plurality,

6

to indicate.

7

10
11

That you have to look to the authority that has

If there were an unlawful delegation, that would not

9

If there is an unlawful delegation, that would not

transfer on to the delegee the ability to impose municipal
liability.
QUESTION:

So the mayor can leave it to somebody and

12

so long as that person does not act consistently enough to

13

establish a policy that becomes open and notorious, there can

14

be no municipal liability.

Is that an accurate statement?

15

MR. WILSON:

That is our position, yes.

16

The concurring opinions in Pembaur by Justice White

17

and joined in by Justice O'Connor indicate and they are at

18

variance with the plurality, although I think if applied here

19

would reach the same result, which would be reversal, would

20

indicate that where the law has placed limits on the city

21

official and he acts contrary to and outside those limits, that

22

his acts cannot be considered to be policies of the

23

governmental entity.

24
25

Applied here, clearly there was criteria through our
Civil Service system and parameters on the Defendant Hamsher.
The Civil Service system has specifically provided in its
17

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

charter amendment that the system is to be run on merit and

2

fitness based upon service ratings.

There is a right of appeal

3

that has been specifically granted.

I think that right of

4

For example, Petitioner argues that Hamsher was

solely responsible for the transfer of Praprotnik from a secure

position in the CDA to an insecure position at Heritage and

22

23

Now, let me explain that situation.

Praprotnik had

had about 19 or 20 years of service at CDA.

There were three

or four people in his same position underneath him.

That's part of the evidence.

The other

evidence is that Mr. Hamsher testified in his testimony that he

Mr. Oldham, may I inquire of your position

whether — if there is a policy making person or body of the

hiring, transfers and discharge, and,' if a lower ranking

decides for wholly improper reasons to make a retaliatory

Yes.
Only on what we would consider

appropriate circumstances where the higher officials or the

25

constructive notice of what happened and permitted it to go on.

MR. OLDHAM:

In this situation, which

involved the transfer, the right to make transfers was

delegated by the Civil Service Commission to Mr. Hamsher, the

Director of Personnel, Mr. Duffe and the receiving official,

Mr. Jackson.

MR. OLDHAM:

For certain services it is a policy

QUESTION:

The right to make transfers is what you

say they delegated is not necessarily the right to establish

policy for transfers.

20

MR. OLDHAM:

Where do you assert that that resided?
All right.

The policy for transfers was

21

established in this case by the action of the mayor, the board

22

of ENA and with the knowledge of the Civil Service Commission.

23

QUESTION:

I am not saying in this case. I am saying

I think it is a mixed question of law,

But I think the jury in this case

the policy maker and whether or not these high officials

13

represented the actions of the City.
They were also told that the City can only be liable

14
15

if it was part of a policy that was knowingly followed by the

16

City so that this was what was submitted to the jury in this

17

case.

And the jury then found the City responsible.

that the Court of Appeals proceeded on the wrong legal basis in

doing what it did, shouldn't it have a chance to redo its

appellate job based on the right rule of law?

15

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, Your Honor, of course that is one

16

of the options available to the Court.

17

can also look at the basic case and say the decision of the

18

Court of Appeals was right, but some of their reasoning was not

correct and you could give the correct reasoning and go ahead

Instead, they reprimanded him for what he had originally been

in his personnel file.

There were other things that happened.

Mr. Spaid

12

called him in and they reduced his pay a couple of pay steps

13

right after they had recommended him for a two-step increase.

14

And this happened right after the Civil Service hearing. After

15

that, his responsibilities were reduced.

16

in, they had the incident with the Seraph sculpture and after

17

that things went really downhill and he was reduced further in

18

responsibilities.

19

When Mr. Hamsher came

Much of his work was taken away from him.

QUESTION:

But you don't give any other instances

20

where any of these things was done to anyone else. So, if there

21

is a policy that, as opposed to a single incident that you are

22

complaining about, it really is a "Get Praprotnik policy."

23

that the policy you are complaining about here?

24

MR. OLDHAM:

That is about what happened, Judge,

MR. OLDHAM:

That if you

I think that is within the meaning of

1983.

If you have a single isolated incident, that is one

thing. That is something that happens within a relatively short

period of time to one individual. But when you have a number of

11

incidents and it is clear over a period of three years directed

12

at that individual, I think you have a "Get Praprotnik" policy.

13

And I remember that the case of Parlow v. Fitzgerald where

14

there was a "Get Fitzgerald" policy and it is somewhat similar.

Because the mayor made the decision1to

are relying on your motion for a directed verdict at the close

of his case.

14

MR. WILSON:

Yes, that's correct.
Which, it seems to me, allows your

might not have been referred to in the instructions?

MR. WILSON:

Yes, that is correct.

out, though, his theory of the case in no way is directed to

the mayor as a policy maker.
