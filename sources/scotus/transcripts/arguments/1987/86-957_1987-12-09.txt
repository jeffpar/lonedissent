ORAL ARGUMENT BY H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. FARR:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is a decision of the Fifth

11

Circuit holding that a litigant can undo all prior rulings of a

12

judge, even final judgments, merely by showing after the fact

13

an appearance of impropriety.

14

Our disagreement with this broad rule rests upon two

15

principal points.

16

drastic remedy of retroactive relief simply should not be

17

awarded for claims based on appearances of impropriety.

18

appearance of impropriety justifies prospective relief under

19

the statute, but not the invalidation of prior orders.

20

Second, and more specifically, we think that

First, and foremost, we think that the

An

21

retroactive relief is particular inappropriate in the case

22

where the judge did not know of the grounds for possible

23

recusal at the time of his rulings.

24

no possibility of actual prejudice infecting the judgment.

25

In such a case, there is

Now, before turning to these points in more detail, I

(202) 628-4888

1

would like to note briefly the precise grounds on which the

2

court below invalidated the judgment.

3

accepted the fact that Judge Collins, who is a trustee of

4

Loyola University, did not know when he ruled that Petitioner

5

was one of several possible purchasers of Loyola University

6

land.

7

The Court of Appeals

By the way, I should point out that in Judge Collins'

8

opinion on the merits, there is a discussion at some length of

mentioned at all in the case.

That is not the land

That particular land was not

The appearance in this case, therefore, was based

12
13

wholly on the notion that Judge Collins should have known about

14

this because the matter had come up several times at Loyola

15

Board meetings.
QUESTION:

16
17

He testified that he did not know; didn't

he, at the time?
MR. FARR:

He did.

QUESTION:

How could that be?

MR. FARR:

That he would not know about this

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

24

MR. FARR:

I think that is actually not so

25

surprising, Your Honor.

As he testified, he had something like

a matter that came up a few times at the Board meetings.

was in January of 1980.

there was no discussion about this whatsoever.

6

area in which he took any particular interest, as he testified.

And, indeed, Cannon Five of the Code of Judicial Ethics, which

8

was not enacted into the statute, affirmatively prohibits a

judge from giving investment advice to a University or a

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, how large is the Board of

It is quite substantial.

If you look at

14

the membership, I don't know the exact number, but I think it

15

is 30-35 members or something like that.

22

QUESTION:

And is it divided into small committees

with particular responsibilities?
MR. FARR:

Typically for operations, Your Honor,

that's what happens.
QUESTION:

And what sort of committee handled this

piece of real estate?
MR. FARR:

There was a real estate committee which

23

handled matters like this and Judge Collins was not on the real

24

estate committee.

25

was on a presidential search committee.

He was on a student affairs committee.

Heritage

He

But he was not on a

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

committee that had anything to do with the University and its

2

investments.
QUESTION:

3
4

And how often did the committee report to

the full Board?
MR. FARR:

5

I believe it just reported as it had need

6

to.

7

Honor, there are indications of certain reports that they had

8

made.

minutes in there, but there are usually one or two paragraphs

out of 10 or 11 pages worth of minutes.
QUESTION:

What is the difference that he didn't

12

remember the actual occurrence when he was on the Board.

13

knew he was on the Board.

He

14

MR. FARR:

He knew he was on the Board.

15

QUESTION:

And he knew that the case he was trying

16

was a case against an organization that he was a member of the

17

Board of Trustees.

18

MR. FARR:

Let me clarify that.

QUESTION:

He knew that; didn't he?

MR. FARR:

Let me clarify.

QUESTION:

Well, I am sure -- I just can't understand

how he didn't remember.
MR. FARR:

Well, I think that that is a finding that

Judge Schwartz made, looking at the particular history of the

10

minutes, looking at his role, he said that he accepted Judge

11

Collins' testimony which, of course, he made under oath, that

12

he did not know about this particular interest.

13

QUESTION:

But he did know that he was on the Board.

14

MR. FARR:

Oh, of course, he knew he was on the

Board, Your Honor.

It wasn't prepared — nobody -- there

QUESTION:

1

But in all of the argument, I just want

2

to warn you, that it appears that what you are saying is that

3

he didn't know about it.

4

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

And he couldn't have known about it and he

6

shouldn't have known about it.
MR. FARR:

7

I am saying that he did not know about it.

8

There was nothing about the case, itself, that would have

9

alerted it to us.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, then, it wasn't important to the

case; was it?

12

MR. FARR:

In the particular situation --

13

QUESTION:

It was or it wasn't?

14

MR. FARR:

The Court of Appeals found that this was

15

an interest of Loyola's that would have been -- that Loyola had

16

an interest that would have been affected by the outcome of the

17

case.

18

have alerted the presiding judge, which was Judge Collins, to

19

that fact.

But there was nothing about the case, itself, that would

20

The piece of information he needed to alert him to

21

possible grounds for recusal had come out of Board meetings.

22

Some of which he had attended and some of which he hadn't and

23

from the minutes of those Board meetings.

24
25

And Judge Schwartz, a separate district judge in
Louisiana made an express finding that he accepted that Judge
8

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

1

Collins did not actually know at the time he was presiding in

2

this case and making his rulings that Loyola had any interest

3

whatsoever.
What the Court of Appeals did then was to say, "We

4
5

accept the finding that he had no knowledge.

But because he

6

could have had knowledge, we are going to set the judgment

7

aside anyway."

8

QUESTION::

And should have.

9

MR. FARR::

And should have in that particular case.

10

That's correct.
QUESTION::

11

It certainly is hard for a colleague to

12

sit on this kind of a case involving another colleague's word;

13

isn't it?

14

MR. FARR::

Justice Blackmun, I think it obviously is

15

an awkward matter.

But let me point out several things.

16

of all, there is nothing uncommon about judges passing on the

17

actual conduct of another judge.

18

QUESTION::

Of a colleague?

19

MR. FARR::

Excuse me?

20

QUESTION:

Of a colleague?

21

MR. FARR:

Of course.

First

Under Section 372 of Title 28,

22

Congress has set up a process for investigating disciplinary

23

complaints against judges.

24

complaints are referred to the chief judge of the district.

25

They are reviewed by judges in the circuit of that district.

Heritage

And that precisely depends -- the

9
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

So, Congress clearly has an expectation through that statute,

2

if none other, that when it is necessary, judges can and should

3

pass on the conduct of their colleagues.

4

And in this particular case, I might just point out

5

there are seven different judges who have said that they

6

accepted Judge Collins' explanation as being true.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Farr, did the judgment below

8

rest on the premise that he could have known and should have

9

known or on the premise that in any event, there was an

10

appearance of bias.

11

MR. FARR:

Well, in a sense, it rests on both,

12

Justice Brennan.

13

rationale is, as I understand it, is that because he should

14

have known, someone looking at the case from outside and no

15

knowing or not accepting that he didn't remember would have

16

expected that he would remember.

17

linked, I think in the Court of Appeals.

18

What he said, what the Court of Appeals'

QUESTION:

Well, I think they are essential; aren't

19

they?

20

is if he should have known.

The only reason the appearance would have been the case,

MR. FARR:

21

So, the two are in some sense

Well, in fact, my belief, Justice White,

22

is the only way there is an appearance is actually if he did

23

know.

24

QUESTION:

I know that is your position.

25

MR. FARR:

But, at least, if the Court of Appeals'
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

decision, by its own terms, does at least involve the idea that

2

he should have known that there is at least negligence involved

3

here.

4

QUESTION:

May I ask:

How is the property described?

5

I can imagine my sitting in a case that involves the real

6

estate that my house is on.

7

and bounds or something, I have no idea what the meets and

8

bounds are.

9

MR. FARR:

If it is only described by meets

It was described as the Monroe tract.

10

That is the term that is used.

11

QUESTION:

12

So, it is something well enough known in

the community that he would know what the Monroe tract was?
MR. FARR:

13

Well, I don't think it is a household

14

word, Justice Scalia.

I think it is just something that that

15

was the term that was used.
This is not property, I should point out, that is

16
17

connected to Loyola University.

18

lot of universities have that was given to the university.
QUESTION:

19

This is just property like a

What I am suggesting is that there are two

20

elements involved in the "should have known" part of the

21

inquiry.

22

University had an interest in this particular trace.

23

Element 1 is that he should have known that the

And Element 2 is that he should have known that that

24

tract which the University had an interest in was also the

25

tract that was under discussion in the case.

Is it conceded

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that the identification of the two is self-evident.

And that

2

anybody who had sat in on the University proceedings would know

3

that this is the same tract?

4

MR. FARR:

I think from that question I have failed

5

to make one thing clear.

The tract that was discussed in the

6

case was not the tract that Loyola University owned.

7

only thing that came up in the case that would have triggered

8

the memory of Judge Collins would have been the mention of

9

St. Jude Corporation, which was one of the potential buyers of

And the

10

the Monroe tract.

But at the time that the case was going on,

11

the tract that was being discussed in the case was some other

12

tract that was bought by Hospital Corporation of American.

13

had nothing to do with Loyola University at all.

14

nothing about that tract or the discussion of that in the case

15

that would give him any hint that Loyola University --

It

So, there is

16

QUESTION:

How did the other tract come into this?

17

MR. FARR:

What essentially happened, as a practical

18

matter, is that Liljeberg, the Petitioner, thought he was going

19

to have an agreement with HCA.

20

the Loyola tract, a tract having nothing to do with Loyola.

21

And HCA had bought a tract, not

When that agreement fell apart, when HCA said, "We're

22

not going to enter into any agreement with you, then Liljeberg

23

resumed negotiations with Loyola looking to some other tract.

24

But that had nothing to do with what was in front of

25

Judge Collins.
12

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

Well, how, again, did the lower courts

reason that he should have disqualified himself in this case?
MR. FARR:

3

Well, in fact, there is no way that he

4

could have, as a practical matter, disqualified himself because

5

of something he didn't know about.

6

saying is that he should have known about it because St. Jude

7

Corporation had been mentioned a couple of times at Board

8

meetings at Loyola University as one of several possible

9

purchasers of a Loyola tract of land.

10

So, what they are really

And, also,

Mr. Liljeberg had been mentioned once several years before.
What they are saying is:

11

That should have

12

essentially put him on notice that when a corporation named St.

13

Jude appeared in front of him and there was a debate over

14

ownership of this corporation and who would have the rights to

15

construct a hospital pursuant to a certificate of need, that

16

should have triggered in his mind the memories of what happened

17

at the Board meeting so that then he would have recognized it

18

and recused himself.
And Judge Collins said,

19

"If I had remembered this, if

20

anything had triggered in my mind, I would have recused

21

myself."

22
23
24
25

But that just simply didn't happen.
QUESTION:

Because of this, he should not have sat in

a case in which St. Jude was a litigant.
MR. FARR:

Is that the idea?

He said that had he known that St. Jude —

had made the connection between the St. Jude that was a
13

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

litigant or the corporation that was in the case and the

2

potential purchaser of land from Loyola and, since he wanted to

3

build a hospital on it, winning the case was something that had

4

an effect on whether he bought the land from Loyola.

5

If he had made that connection, which he simply

6

didn't, he would have recused himself.

7

testified to.

8

9

QUESTION:

And that is what he

Well, Mr. Farr, what effect does Section

455(c) have here, if indeed this is something that the judge

10

properly should have informed himself about?

If we get that

11

far, if it fits, what effect does that sub-section have?

12

MR. FARR:

Well, I think there are two questions

13

about that, Justice O'Connor.

14

in fact, this is an interest that a judge had an absolute

15

obligation to know about under sub-section (c) --

First of all, if a judge -- if,

16

QUESTION:

If he is covered by sub-section (c) here.

17

MR. FARR:

Just assuming that for moment, which I

18

don't think is true, as I will explain in a second, then the

19

question would be:

20

proper remedy essentially to enforce his failure to know

21

something that he should have known?

22

punishment essentially for his negligence, facing the fact that

23

it doesn't really fall on Judge Collins.

24

litigant who has prevailed in the case.

25

QUESTION:

Is retroactive relief still is that a

Is that a proper

It falls on the

But in the long run, do you think it

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

conceivably would be better for judges to have a "should have

2

known" rule applied to them than to go into the actuality of

3

their knowledge and have it tried in each instance?

4

kind of tough.
MR. FARR:

5

That's

That brings me to the second point which

6

is that, to some extent, this is exactly what Congress faced

7

and the Ethics Committee faced

in drafting the code and the

8

rules.

of things.

9

didn't put "known" or "should have known" in Section (b)(4),

10

where they specifically used the term, "knows" and there are

11

several other provisions in Section (b)(5) where they could

12

have very easily said, "knows"

or "should know" andthey didn't

13

do it.

is Congress that has put

14

knowledge into play at least in the cases arising before.

And there are a couple

So, to some extent, it

First of all, they

15

QUESTION:

But they also enacted sub-section (c).

16

MR. FARR:

But sub-section (c), even if read at its

17

strictest, would only impose a duty of absolute knowledge in a

18

couple of instances:

19

financial interest.

20

for example, regarding the interests of a spouse, a reasonable

21

efforts clause regarding the interests of a minor child and

22

doesn't have any requirement for anybody else.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

personal financial interest and fiduciary
It has only a reasonable efforts clause,

Well, is this a fiduciary financial

interest; do you think?
MR. FARR:

It is not as the code intends it.

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And

1

think this is what is important.

2

QUESTION:

Why?

3

MR. FARR:

If you look at Section 5 of the Judicial

4

Code, which is not incorporated in the statute, to begin with,

5

that has a specific section which is headed,

6

Interest," and speaks of the very strict limitations on a

7

sitting judge serving as a private fiduciary.

like that.
Cannon Five also makes distinctions between private

11
12

trusts and charitable organizations, universities, religious

13

organizations.

14

statute pulls this in at least in part in sub-section (d) to

15

try to give judges broader latitude to serve as public

16

trustees.

17
18
19

And it is specifically intended and I think the

It simply does not fit that scheme.
QUESTION:

Well, you think we are not bound by the

language of Section 455 in defining financial interests, then?
MR. FARR:

No.

I mean I think that you are bound to

20

interpret the language in 455.

22

context with section (b)(4) which talks of specific kinds of

23

interest on which you are automatically recused in connection

24

with the legislative history and in connection with the Cannon.

25

I am not suggesting that it is

All I am saying is that it should be read in

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't an interest in real estate

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

qualify as something other than securities, for example?
MR. FARR:

Well, I think it is not -- this is

3

something that, unfortunately, the legislative history is not

4

entirely clear on.

5

there are economic interests that aren't financial interests.

6

I think it is quite clear if you take it all together that

7

investments other than, let's say, a very narrow definition of

8

securities, stocks and bonds, which are owned by a university

9

are not in any way the kinds of things that Congress intended

10

There are financial interests and then

that a judge have to keep track of --

11

QUESTION:

No, but maybe real estate is.

12

MR. FARR:

Well, that is a subject that is not

13

specifically spoken to.

14

universities own literally hundreds of parcels of real estate

15

that are left to them in wills, that are given to them by

16

donors, and to say that a judge who sat on a case had to know

17

every single real estate holding of a university and how it

18

would be effected, and that would be the absolute duty under

19

Section 455(c), because that basically says you have to know.

20

It doesn't say you should know or anything like that.

21

you have to.

22

I would point out that many

It says

If that was true, then judges simply would not

23

realistically be able to sit as trustees of those organizations

24

and that is exactly the reverse of what Congress and the

25

drafters of the code had in mind.

Your position is that although the Congress didn't say so that

I think that clearly

Whether there is some case where

the involvement of the judge in whatever it is is so serious
that it raises the same concerns that you would have under due
process or perhaps under (b), I suppose there might be latitude
for that.
QUESTION:

For example, would there be latitude if,

say, the day after he released his findings, they discovered
the alleged conflict -- the disqualifying fact.

And they had

gone in right away on a motion for a new trial and motion to
disqualify and have another judge taken another look?

Would

you take the same view that it is just simply too late?
MR. FARR:

The view to me is not that it is too late.

It is simply that that is not enough to invalidate everything
that went before.

much as it is those particular grounds.

14

QUESTION:

Isn't it possible, Mr. Farr, that even if

there are questions at what particular point this is raised.

Certainly, our argument, quite frankly, is that whenever this

had been raised, had it been the day after or had it been

during appeal or, as it was here, a year and a half after the

QUESTION:

That is correct.
