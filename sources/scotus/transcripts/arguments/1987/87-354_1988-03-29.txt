ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE M. FERG, ESQUIRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FERG:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

10

The issue before the Court in this case is the proper

11

scope of application of the per se exclusionary rule of Edwards

12

v. Arizona, namely, that the police may not initiate further

13

interrogation of an arrestee who has stated a desire to speak

14

with counsel.

15

More specifically, should, as has been done in some

16

Arizona State cases, the scope of application of Edwards be

17

extended to reach beyond its facts to situations where there is

18

more than one investigation going on, or kept basically as the

19

facts of Edwards were with a single investigation where there

20

were renewed attempts to interrogate on that same

21

investigation, or possibly should Edwards itself be

22

reconsidered.

23

Now, the facts which bring this case before the Court

24

at this time are relatively simple.

25

Roberson was arrested in the course of a burglary.

Heritage

On April 6,

1985, Ronald
The

arresting officer, Perez, gave him his Miranda warnings, and he
said that he wanted a lawyer before answering any questions.
However, moments later when Roberson was approached
by another officer who was unaware of this indication of
rights, who asked whether he'd be willing to make a statement,
he indicated that he would, and as a result of this, he was
thereafter questioned several different times by a number of
different officers.
QUESTION:

What if he had been aware that he had

exercised his right to counsel with respect to another crime
being investigated?
MR. FERG:

The other crime was not in the picture at

all at this stage.
QUESTION:

I know, but what if the second officer

knew that he had invoked his right to counsel at an earlier
time?
MR. FERG:

Our position would be if in fact there

were a separate investigation as arose in this case, it would
be appropriate to ask.
QUESTION:

So you'd be making the same argument?

MR. FERG:

Yes, sir.

So the situation -QUESTION:

Why shouldn't there be a separate warning?

MR. FERG:

There were in fact separate warnings

given.

QUESTION:

2

MR. FERG:

Yes, each time.

3

QUESTION:

That second one was a separate warning?

4

MR. FERG:

Yes, sir.

5

Each time that Mr. Roberson was

approached, he was rewarned.

6

QUESTION:

He was rewarned?

7

MR. FERG:

Yes, sir.

8

QUESTION:

So that they admitted that there were

9

separate proceedings?

10

MR. FERG:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

Otherwise, they wouldn't have given the

12

separate warnings?

13

MR. FERG:

I believe not.

14

QUESTION:

But they if they knew there were separate

15

proceedings, why didn't they abide by the Miranda rule which

16

says, once you want a lawyer and make it clear the questioning

17

stops?

18

MR. FERG:

Well, neither in Miranda nor in Edwards

19

was there a multiple investigation situation going on.

20

Court has not really addressed very specifically what happens

21

when you have multiple investigations except in two situations.

22

The

One was Westover which was a companion case to

23

Miranda, and the second one was in Michigan v. Mosley and in

24

both of those cases, the Court included language which

25

indicated that if there were --

MR. FERG:

Westover was very well argued.

MR. FERG:

And I believe that the Court resolved

5

QUESTION:

I argued it.

6

MR. FERG:

The point of Westover though is, and it's

7

connection with Mosley was the indication that if in fact there

8

were a separate investigation that proper warnings were given

9

so that the people in the succeeding investigation were not

10

simply taking advantage of whatever badgering or wearing down

11

had occurred in the first investigation, that that second

12

investigation should be treated separately.

shouldn't be an automatic or per se exclusion.

MR. FERG:

That is the approach that they've taken,

20

about.

21

but again, it's the State of Arizona's position that what

22

actually happened was an undue extension of Miranda and Edwards

23

beyond their facts.

24

legitimate police investigative needs, particularly for

25

example, the language in Moran v. Burbine pointing out that it

The Court recognized that there in fact

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation

is not interrogation or admission per se which are deemed
unfavorably by this Court, but rather the abuse of that
process.
And that therefore Miranda itself drew a very subtle
balance -QUESTION:

Is the State's position the same if the

interrogator were to see an individual in both interrogations?
MR. FERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So it makes no difference even though that

might influence the defendant that perhaps it's a continuation
of the first interrogation.
In fact, here wasn't the detective in the last
interview also present at the first interview, one of them?
MR. FERG:

Detective Quinn was a common element, but

he was not present at the time that Mr. Roberson actually said
that he wanted a lawyer.

The only person present at that time

was the arresting officer, Perez.

Quinn showed up some time

later, and -QUESTION:

But Quinn knew about it, didn't he?

MR. FERG:

No, he did not.

The defense counsel below

stipulated that none of the officers besides -QUESTION:

I know they stipulated, but why wouldn't

he be aware of it?
MR. FERG:

No one told him, including Mr. Roberson.

At no point did Mr. Roberson ever indicate any reluctance at

Reporting Corporation

all to speak to any of the succeeding officers, and in fact, he
was volunteering information which was part of the reason why
there were so many other instances of police talking to him.
He was indicating that he had information that he was
willing to give about drug dealers and about robberies
committed by other people.

So they were not there badgering

him about his offense in which he'd been effectively caught
red-handed.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that in a large and

efficiently operated police department, a request for a lawyer
ought to be regarded as known to every interrogator, successive
or otherwise.
MR. FERG:

Well, the difficulty is that in a fast

breaking situation, even in the best of departments, that
doesn't always work.

We had one officer here who was on the

He was aware of that indication.
QUESTION:

Well, the fast breaking aspect is one of

the difficulties that you face, I think.
MR. FERG:

So, we have this situation where in fact

none of the succeeding officers was aware that any indication
for counsel had taken place.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferg, as I understood your answer to

Justice White, that really doesn't make any difference to your
legal position.

MR. FERG:

What we are suggesting is that, as was

I have been unable to come up with any

single factor which would properly distinguish all cases, and

23

that's why it seems to be appropriate to indicate that the

25

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that the per se rule

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

1

doesn't apply if it's a separate investigation whatever that

2

means.

3

MR. FERG:

Correct.

4

QUESTION:

But you would continue to look at the

5

confession to see whether in fact it was coerced?

6

MR. FERG:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

Which could take into account all of these

8

other factors that you're concerned about.

9

MR. FERG:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

You would absolutely eliminate the per se

11

rule so long as it's a separate investigation?

12

MR. FERG:

Yes.

13

No, no, excuse me.

14

QUESTION:

No. Well, then I don't understand you.

15

MR. FERG:

Assuming that this Court intends to

16

maintain Edwards in some form, what Arizona is arguing for is

17

that it not be applied beyond Edwards facts, namely, in a

18

situation where you have more than one investigation going on.

19

So the result of that would be if you have the man,

20

he's questioned the first time, he invokes his right to

21

counsel, the second situation comes up, separate investigation,

22

come in and all that you can do is ask him can we in fact talk

23

to you about this second investigation, and if he says, no, I

still want to talk to my lawyer, then you leave him alone.

QUESTION:

But he was still under prison, he was

MR. FERG:

The reason why Arizona is advocating this particular
approach can be based on two types of grounds.
precedent.

First is

As I've already indicated, neither Miranda itself,

nor Edwards deals with a multi-investigation type of situation
The only cases that do deal with those are Westover and Mosley
and they both indicate that with proper facts, such that there
is a reasonable separation of the one investigation from the
other, that in fact that kind of a statement which is preceded
by another appropriate rights warning ought to be admitted.
QUESTION:

What happens under your theory if in the

second interrogation which is lawful, he admits to something
that pertains to the first investigation?

Is that admissible?

MR. FERG:

I would argue that it would be.

QUESTION:

I thought so.

MR. FERG:

Because the police have in that instance

done nothing inappropriate.

The fact that he felt moved to

talk about something which was really not germane to the thing
that he was being interrogated about at that stage, as Miranda
says, things which are volunteered are always admissible.
So we have effectively precedent, a situation which

14
Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

permits or suggests that separate investigations ought to
indeed be treated differently.
Policy question.

This Court has made it very clear

that exclusionary rules which is effectively what the rule of
Edwards is ought not lightly to be extended.

And that this

kind of resistance to extension is particularly true in the
Miranda type of area.
Chief Justice Rehnquist's in Chambers opinion in Fare
v. Michael C. summarizes a number of cases like that.

Since,

as was indicated in Moran v. Burbine admissions are in fact
favored by the law, it says there that they are more than
merely desirable but essential to society's compelling interest
in finding convicting and punishing those who violate the law,
then there needs to be a weight against that interest what
exactly is going to happen.
To exclude a properly warned totally voluntary
statement which comes out of the separate investigation simply
is not a reasonable drawing or weighing of those competing
interests.

And because the situation with a multi­

investigation case is such that there is not likely to be the
kind of badgering which were the very reasons for Miranda and
Edwards being announced in the first place, it is the State's
position that the only appropriate drawing of the line or
weighing of the interests is that in a truly separate case or
separate investigation, then the police ought to be permitted

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

to at least approach the man and ask him about that separate
investigation.
And I'll reserve the rest of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Ferg.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Larkin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR., ESQUIRE
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court.
It's not uncommon for a suspect to be implicated in
two or more crimes that are being separately investigated by
different law enforcement officers or even entirely different
law enforcement agencies.

And I'd therefore like to use an

example to help illustrate our position in this case.
The Tucson, Arizona police arrest a suspect for the
hold-up of a package store.

At the same time, the FBI may have

reason to believe that this person has been involved in an
unrelated armed bank robbery, a crime occurring at a different
time and in a different location.
If the suspect invokes his right to silence, then
under Mosley, the FBI would be able to approach the suspect to
see if he is willing to talk with them about the bank
robberies.

If the suspect invokes his right to counsel, but is

later released, then the FBI can approach the suspect about the
armed bank robberies.

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Now, it's our position that the FBI should not be
forbidden from approaching the suspect to ask him if he wants
to talk about the bank robberies simply because the suspect has
invoked his right to counsel, and even though the suspect has
not yet been released from police custody.

That submission, we

believe, is consistent with the Edwards case.
Edwards was concerned with the potential for
badgering when the police are allowed repeatedly to interrogate
a suspect who has asked for a lawyer.

When there are truly

independent investigations that are underway, that risk we
believe is far less likely to be present.

That's true whether

you look at the problem from the suspect's point of view or
from the police point of view.
First, when the officers approach the suspect, if
they make clear at the outset either before or after giving
Miranda warnings, that they are interested in an entirely
different matter, the suspect is not likely to believe that his
request for counsel has been fictional.

He's likely to believe

instead that he can control what is out of bounds.
QUESTION:

About the request for counsel being a

fiction, is that true if three or four days go by and no lawyer
ever shows up?

Isn't he going to think it's a fiction then?

QUESTION:
interval?

And that's what happened here, a three-day

Heritage

if three days have gone by and none arrives?

2

And as I understand it, they never really do provide

3

counsel.

4

them until he gets arraigned and so forth.

5

They say it's available but they just don't provide

MR. LARKIN:

But that isn't likely to be something

7

instance, the FBI when they come into to talk to him.

MR. LARKIN:

Because he has invoked his right to

counsel with respect to what's there.
QUESTION:

But you were making the point the fact

15

there was a different interrogator he would still feel quite

16

confident that his right to counsel was not merely a fiction.

17

But I suggest to you that he would think quite the

18

contrary if no lawyer had been appointed when the police said,

19

all you have to do is ask for a lawyer and you'll get one

20

before there's any further questioning.

21

around and question him again without providing him a lawyer.

22

MR. LARKIN:

If he has asked

knows that by asking for a lawyer, the police are no longer
going to badger him or question him.
And if the new officers come in and tell him at the
outset that they want to talk about a different matter -QUESTION:

And they say again, we will provide you a

lawyer if you want one, he'll take that at face value even
though that same thing that was said three days earlier and he
never got a lawyer.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, he may not take it at literal face

value, but what he will realize is this: he'll realize that
these police have told him they're going to talk about a
different matter.

He knows then that his request for a lawyer

has at least allowed him to avoid questioning about the first
matter.

He's likely to believe therefore that he can control

the subject of the questioning.
Because he hasn't been questioned beforehand, if he
doesn't want to be questioned this time, he's likely to believe
he just has to say, I don't want to talk, or I want a lawyer,
and then in our submission, that questioning would have to
cease.

So by fictional, I mean in a sense of just ignoring it

right then and there and just going ahead with questioning.
QUESTION:

I'm a little confused.

The first question was by a state officer, right?
MR. LARKIN:
QUESTION:

A local police officer, Your Honor, yes.

MR. LARKIN:

In my hypothetical, not in this case.

QUESTION:

Oh.

QUESTION:

Would you say that in the second

interrogation, it would be appropriate for the FBI in your
hypothetical to advise him that they cannot question him about
the first crime because he's asked for counsel?
MR. LARKIN::

It would certainly be an appropriate

thing for the FBI to do.
QUESTION:
MR. LARKIN::

Should we require that?
Whether you're going to require an

additional warning -QUESTION:
MR. LARKIN::

Yes .
-- of that type I think would be

inappropriate
QUESTION:

Why, if this is what he thinks.

You said that he knows that he can't be questioned or
he can reasonably assume he can't be questioned about the first
crime.
What's wrong with making a rule that the FBI has to
tell him that.
MR. LARKIN::

Because I think it would probably become

as soon as he starts asking a question.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's apparent then what's the

harm?
MR. LARKIN::

The harm may simply be that adding an

additional type of rule into this circumstance may perhaps
complicate the matter unnecessarily.
I mean, take this case for example.
QUESTION:

Let's take this case, Mr. Larkin, your

assumption unfortunately that he knows that he can't be
questioned about the first crime doesn't fit very well into the
facts of this particular case.

Because despite his request for

counsel at the time of the investigation of the first crime, he
was indeed approached, what, three or four times, before the
second investigation approached him.
MR, LARKIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
So this particular defendant had no reason

to believe that they indeed kept their promise that when he
asked for counsel that he wouldn't be bothered further.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, he -- that's because of the

peculiarities of this particular case.
QUESTION:

Well unfortunately that's the case we're

deciding.
MR. LARKIN:

But what we're asking the Court to do is

recognize that this general rule should apply.

We don't think

that the facts of this case should preclude the Court from
adopting it, and we also don't think the facts of this case
counsel against it.
For example, in this case, the reason he was
approached during this interim was he also said at the very

the April 16th burglary.
QUESTION:

And you think the repeated violations of

his rights are irrelevant as to the second crime?
MR. LARKIN:

It's relevant only if you take into

13

account the possibility that his waiver has been overcome

14

because he's been badgered by the police.

15

we're not saying that these factors can't be taken into account

16

in deciding whether the suspect has validly waived his rights.

17

In that respect,

Our position is simply that the officer who is

18

conducting the independent investigation should be entitled to

19

approach the person to find out if he is willing to discuss the

20

new subject matter.

he should be allowed to approach him is he may not be aware of

MR. LARKIN:

9

How do you formulate your rule?
What the second investigation has to be

10

independent of is the episode that led to the suspect's arrest.

11

It is independent in the hypo you gave in the sense that the

12

crime he's being questioned about the second time is a

13

different crime, but it may be as the Court refines this rule

14

in those circumstances that it decides what it would be

appropriate is to see whether or not the police knew at the

time they made the first arrest that he had committed several

We maybe have some sloppy recordkeeping, but -MR. BARRASSO:

Your Honor, it's my position that four

times, he was questioned four different times, that we can
presume that if it happened in this case, it's going to happen
again.

One mistake, certainly that would be negligence, but he

was questioned again and again, and I've certainly argued that
we are going to put a premium on ignorance if we adopt the rule
as set for at least in part in the petitioner's brief, and in
this case, I think we have seen that all the police officers
basically stayed ignorant, and in spite of the clear law that
suggests that they should have told each other that this man
only wanted to speak through counsel.

He only asked the first one for counsel.

It isn't that all of them stayed ignorant.

It's just that the

He asked for counsel the first time, and never

then he is questioned again the next day.

The Officer's not

important.
And then two days later, Officer Quinn who was
present two days earlier, and another officer, questioned him
about a separate investigation.

I think these facts are very

important because the fact that Mr. Roberson requested an
attorney before answering any questions has to be given a broad
interpretation.
We have to put ourselves in the common sense position
of a person under arrest, told that he has the right to a
lawyer before answering any questions -QUESTION:

What was he being held under?

MR. BARRASSO:
QUESTION:

MR. BARRASSO:

MR. BARRASSO:

The Colorado v. Spring case looked at this same issue

No, he was not arraigned.

How long can you hold somebody in Arizona?
More than three days.

7

from the other point of view.

There a defendant waived his

8

right to silence, clear waiver of his right to silence, and the

9

police went on to investigate not just crime one, but crime

10

two.

The defendant in that case tried to argue before this

11

Court that his waiver was only a waiver for the purpose of

12

crime one.

13

he waived it for all purposes, therefore it was okay for the

14

police to ask him questions about different crimes.

15

This Court said, no.

When you say any questions,

It seems like just the opposite is being argued now.

16

They are arguing that we impose on the defendant some narrow

17

vision of the word, any, so that when he says he wants a

18

lawyer, what he is really saying is, I only want a lawyer for

19

this case.

20

presume that he did that.

21

There is no reason in fact, there is no reason to

The reading of his rights was broad, referred to any

22

questions, and his statement that he wanted a lawyer before

23

answering any questions clearly in his mind concerned all

24

subject matters.

25

QUESTION:

Why is that necessarily true?

Heritage

28
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

You know, it seems to me if I were picked up for a
crime that I was guilty of, I would not want to answer any
questions without a lawyer.

But if I was charged with another

crime that I was not guilty of and that I had absolutely easy
proof that I was not guilty of, I might well want to talk
without lawyer, and get this thing off the books right away.
It doesn't seem to me that you have people out there
walking around, some of whom never want to talk without a
lawyer, and others of whom always want to talk without a
lawyer.

It seems to me much more likely that individuals

decide case by case whether they want to talk or not, depending
probably upon whether they're guilty or not, or how likely they
think they are to incriminate themselves.
MR. BARRASSO:

Your Honor, my focus, or I think I'm

not showing that to say what was in his mind in deciding that
he wanted a lawyer, but how he interpreted their statement.
They made a representation to him and that is he
could have a lawyer before answering any question.

When he's

requestioned whether it be number one or number two, in this
defendant's mind, any questions, here's another question,
where's my lawyer.

It doesn't matter to him that it's subject

argument is, why exclude very probative relevant testimony that

It seems

The statements made by the police whether in good
faith or not appeared to him to be an outright lie so that when
they come in again and repeat these Miranda warnings with
smiles on their faces, I've heard that before, is what's going
on in his mind.

They've said before.

And it's going to give

him the perception that perhaps they're going through the
motions and in the meantime putting together the case.
So I just do not see how after these repeated
questionings, he would still feel like he had the right to
exercise that.
QUESTION:

If there had been no repeated

questionings, and if there were the preface to the questioning
on the second charge that Justice Kennedy suggested, you would
have no problem?
MR. BARRASSO:

I would have a problem because perhaps

if we had one more hypothetical,

I would have no problem, and

that is, the original warnings did not use the broad terms.
But the original warnings clearly used broad terms: you have
the right to remain silent, you have the right to the presence
of a lawyer before any questioning.
Now, if for some reason, the original officer said
before any questioning on just this case, we could interpret,
it would be fair to assume that Mr. Roberson did not think that
it was a broad right.
QUESTION:

I see.

Heritage

So you would want to change the

MR. BARRASSO:

2

And that has been explicitly rejected

3

by this Court in Colorado v. Spring.

They do not want to

4

impose the burden on law enforcement officers to elicit what it

5

is exactly that they are going to question.

6

And in the Colorado v. Spring case, the defendant

7

tried to argue that when they went to subject number two, I

8

should have been informed of the Miranda rights and of my

9

subsequent waiver.

10

And the Colorado v. Spring Court said, no,

we don't have to inform him of everything.
It's very -- just look at the language -- he has the

right to silence, in that case, before answering any questions,

police officers.

We have all State

Unlike the Michigan Mosley case where the

original Mirandas had to do with robberies that occurred and
that the subsequent investigation was about murder in Michigan
v. Mosley, notes these are so separate that his right to
silence was scrupulously honored in both cases.
We don't have that separateness here.

He was

continually questioned about a series of robberies or of
burglaries that took place over a short period of time, often
times by common actors in the two separate investigations.

I

don't think he perceived enough separateness to make this case
the distinguishing case that the Solicitor General has argued.
This Court in Michigan v. Mosley found that Miranda
needed some explaining.

The reason for that is that it found

that the language about silence could be interpreted too
broadly, could be interpreted to mean that if a defendant says
he wants to be silent, he could be silent forever through the
judicial process.

That's bad, the Court said in Michigan v.

Mosley for two reasons; it deprives the defendant himself of
the right to inquire to find out facts about his own case; and
it thwarts police investigation.

helpful to you.

Indeed, you'd be better off waiting a. day or

two and finding this out through your court appointed lawyer.
This Court has both made some rulings that have
limited the Miranda holding and expanded the Miranda holding.
Since the language of Miranda, the Court has made it clear that
Miranda is a prophylactic rule.

necessarily lead to coercion but it is designed to protect
against coercion in the custodial environment.
The State has argued that this Court should
reconsider the Edwards part of the prophylactic rule because

MR. BARRASSO:

No, that is, it is stipulated that

General that we will put too heavy a burden on the subsequent

So you say you just don't need a

MR. BARRASSO:

No.

I think the knowledge of the

I think the earlier examples by

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE M. FERG, ESQUIRE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

3

MR. FERG:

Thank you, sir.

4

QUESTION:

-- arraigning in your State?

5

MR. FERG:

In Arizona, and this is one of the points

6

I wanted to make, the individual must be brought before a

7

magistrate for his initial appearance within 24 hours.

8

time, he --

9
10

QUESTION:

At that

Well, was this man brought before a

magistrate.

11

MR. FERG:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

Did the magistrate ask him about a lawyer?

13

MR. FERG:

He was informed at that stage that he had

14

the right to a lawyer, and as an indigent, the exact

15

proceedings --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And the magistrate could have appointed a

lawyer for him?
MR. FERG:

My understanding is that if they did

19

things as they were supposed to have done, the initial

20

appearance was not transcribed, but if they followed the rules,

21

he was told that he has the right to a lawyer --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But in this case, he wasn't carried before

a magistrate.
MR. FERG:

He was taken before a magistrate, as far

as we know.

QUESTION:

Is that in the record?

2

MR. FERG:

In the record which I believe is before

3

this Court, it shows his initial appearance on the 17th, the

4

day after his -- and under the Arizona rules, that initial

5

appearance includes being asked whether he has a counsel.

6

QUESTION:

And you give us your word that it's in the

8

MR. FERG:

I believe that it is, yes, sir.

9

QUESTION:

You believe it is.

10

QUESTION:

But there's no transcript of what

11

happened, is there?

12

MR. FERG:

At a simple initial appearance, no.

13

QUESTION:

But ordinarily he would be asked if he

7

14

record?

wants a lawyer?

15

MR. FERG:

He would be informed of his right to

16

counsel and told that if he didn't have one, that the public

17

defender would in fact —

18

QUESTION:

Represent him.

19

MR. FERG:

-- represent him and someone would be at

20

the jail within a couple of days to see him.

25

QUESTION:

So we don't know whether that transpired

MR. FERG:

I've no reason to believe that it did not

or not?

because that's what the rules stipulate must happen.
QUESTION:

Well, do you suppose the officers who did

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

1

the questioning the second time, knew?

2

that he had gone before a magistrate and know that he'd been

3

offered a lawyer?

4

was representing him at that time?

5

MR. FERG:

Shouldn't they assume

And for all they knew, the public defender

They might well have assumed that, but

6

again, that is talking essentially in Sixth Amendment terms

7

rather than in Miranda Fifth Amendment terms.

8
9

If we are in fact going to talk Sixth Amendment right
to counsel, he was not arraigned or even arrested because

10

nobody knew about the separate offense at that time, and so

11

there'd be no Sixth Amendment right to preclude any

12

interrogation.

13

QUESTION:

About that second one.

14

MR. FERG:

That's correct.

15

Now, one other point that I wanted to make about the

16

facts of this case is that we are dealing here with someone who

17

is volunteering information and that is the reason why he was

18

repeatedly questioned, not because there was any need to go

19

back and badger him about the offense in which he was caught

20

red-handed.

21

He was talking about his drug contacts, about people

22

who were involved in other burglaries and robberies, and that

23

is the sole reason that the other officers were going back on

24

these other occasions to question him, was to find out about

25

material that he was volunteering, not to badger him.

He could not have invoked his rights to a crime

investigation at that stage.

Otherwise, you are saying that

Edwards effectively immunizes a man to the point where he could
say, I don't want to talk bout anything, and 25 years down the
line, -QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question.

Supposing at that preliminary hearing, they did in
fact appoint a lawyer for the first offense and he just was
representing him on the first offense, -MR. FERG:

Yes?

QUESTION:

-- would you think that if the police knew

he had a lawyer for the first offense, they could go ahead and
question him on the second offense without giving notice to his
lawyer that they were going to do so?
MR. FERG:

I would argue that they could.

QUESTION:

They could.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Ferg.
