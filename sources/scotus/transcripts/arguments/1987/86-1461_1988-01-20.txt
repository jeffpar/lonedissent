ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

The facts in this case are simple and not in dispute.

10

High's, a building contractor, was engaged by Wilson's, a

11

retailer, to build a department store.

12

was to be located on a shopping center owned by DeBartolo.

13

The department store

The union had a dispute with High's because it

14

allegedly paid non-union or sub-standard wages.

15

not have a dispute with Wilson's.

16

with DeBartolo, and it did not have a dispute with any of the

17

tenant stores, approximately eighty-five tenant stores, that

18

were located on the shopping center.

19
20

21

The union did

It did not have a dispute

Neither DeBartolo nor the tenant stores had any
relationship whatsoever with High's.
Now, the union had many ways to express its message,

22

but it did not -- its message as to High's allegedly sub­

23

standard wages. It did not, however, picket or place any

24

economic pressure whatsoever on High.

25

place any economic pressure on Wilson's.

It did not boycott or
It did not merely

3

Heritage

Corporation

1

publicize to the public the fact that High paid sub-standard

2

wages.

3

Instead, the union took a different tack.

For three

4

weeks during the Christmas season, busiest time of the year,

5

the union placed hand billers at all the entrances to the

6

interior mall of the shopping center and urged a total consumer

7

boycott of all the tenants of the shopping center.

8

stopped when it was enjoined after the Florida courts found

9

irrevocable injury.

It only

In 1983, this Court heard the case and unanimously

10

11

concluded that the hand billing was not protected by the

12

publicity proviso of Section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor

13

Relations Act, that the required producer-distributor

14

relationship of that section had not been met.

15

The proviso, the Court indicated, was not intended to

16

preclude all types of peaceful, truthful hand billing, only

17

hand billing that met the terms of the proviso, the three terms

18

of the proviso was to be protected.

19

remanded.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COHEN:

The case was then

Why?
For two reasons.

It was remanded to

22

determine if there was coercion within the meaning of Section

23

8(b)(4).

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. COHEN:

Whether this hand billing was coercive?

Correct, and, if so, whether it was

protected by the 1st Amendment.

2

The Labor Board -- first, there was no dispute, of

3

course,

4

tenants were neutral employers.

The only question, of course,

5

was whether there was coercion.

The Board found there was

6

coercion because the purpose of the union hand billing was to

7

impose substantial economic harm on the tenant stores, and it

8

concluded that was not unconstitutional.

that the union's objective was forbidden and that those

The 11th Circuit, however, refused to enforce the

9
10

Board's order.

11

on the form of the union's conduct.

12

picketing could be coercive within the meaning of Section

13

8(b)(4), and that every other form, hand billing or any other

14

form of publicity, would not be in any way coercive or

15

prohibited by Section 8(b)(4).

16

It held that only picketing focused exclusively
It held that only

The decision, we submit, is contrary to the specific

17

language of the Act itself.

18

about hand billing -- I mean, about picketing, the Act talks

19

about any action that threatens, coerces or restrains a neutral

20

employer.

21

A threat,

The Act itself does not only talk

for example, to engage in conduct to shut

22

down the business of a secondary or to impose substantial

23

economic harm on them, however that threat is communicated,

24

would be prohibited by the Act.

25

Similarly, coercion, as this Court indicated in Tree
5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

Fruits, whether by picketing or otherwise, is forbidden by

2

Section 8(b)(4), and coercion, as this Court has defined it in

3

both Safeco and Allied International, is any conduct which

4

predictably encourages customers to boycott a secondary

5

business or which reasonably can be expected to threaten

6

neutral employers with ruin or substantial loss.

7
8

That's certainly what happened here, and that's what
the Board found.

9

The only type of coercive conduct that's exempted

10

from the statute is that which meets the three specific terms

11

of the proviso; it has to be truthful, it has to involve a

12

producer-distributor relationship, and it cannot induce a work

13

stoppage.

14

is coercive within the meaning of the Act and prohibited by the

15

Act.

16

If it doesn't meet the terms of the proviso, then it

The union here did not, let me repeat, did not just

17

try and express its message.

18

could have said in any way it wanted to that High did not pay

19

sub-standard wages. What it did impermissibly here was go a

20

step further and add to that message the fact of trying to

21

impose pressure, economic pressure, on the neutral tenant

22

stores.

That, it was permitted to do. It

That's where the union violated the Act.

23

Prior to the decision in this case, that's been the

24

decision of not only all the lower courts and the Labor Board

25

itself consistently from the thirty years since those

amendments to the statute were passed.
The court below disregarded that history and it

disregarded that language.

as the 7th Circuit said in Boxhorn, as simply so much blab.

5

The publicity proviso served no useful purpose.

because if the publicity proviso, as the union now argues, was

analysis, by any conduct, whether it be picketing, leafleting,

The House said, we think it

The Senate did not agree. The Senate had no

restrictions on secondary consumer boycotts.

there was a compromise, and that compromise is embodied in the

That's the parameters of

Mr. Cohen, can I ask you this question?

13

Assume that the union wanted to disseminate precisely the same

14

message by using some trucks and outside the shopping center,

15

maybe radio ads or newspaper ads, which would, of course, not

16

be picketing, would that have been prohibited by the statute?
MR. COHEN:

If the intention is to cause substantial

harm to the secondary —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. COHEN:

21

QUESTION:

Well,

it's the same intention here.

That is correct.
That's precisely the same because they

22

don't want people to be going to the shopping center and buy in

23

these stores until High gets its wages up.
QUESTION:

24
25

Well,

it still has to be objectively

coercive.
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. COHEN:

1

That's correct.

It has a trivial effect,

2

for example, if it's an advertisement placed in some distant

3

location that's -QUESTION:

4

No, no.

I'm assuming the audience is the

5

same.

It's beamed at the people who regularly shop there by

6

sound or something, but it's not right on the — at the — that

7

still would be coercion.
MR. COHEN:

predictably encourages a secondary boycott, and that's the test
of coercion as this Court has set it in Safeco and Allied.
QUESTION:

12

In our opinion, yes, because that

Would it matter in this case if nobody

ever paid any attention to the hand billing?

13

MR. COHEN:

14

of the hand billing.

15

the Labor Board, of course,

16

that what the union is doing has the foreseeable consequences

17

of causing loss of business to the secondary,

18

foreseeable consequence, if that's the likelihood, and that was

19

proven at the course of the hearing, an injunction or unfair

20

labor practice, then that would be a coercive conduct and

21

forbidden.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. COHEN:

The question would come up at the outset
If the Labor Board could conclude, and
is the expert tribunal, conclude

if that's a

1

counter-evidence the Labor Board would have to assess.
QUESTION:

2

3

Were there findings in this case as to

what the consequences of the hand billing were?
MR. COHEN:

4

The finding of the Board was that the

5

union's conduct would cause substantial loss to secondary

6

employers.

7

and, by process, then, of course, also DeBartolo.

8

9

Secondary employers being the neutral tenant stores

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cohen, suppose we think the

statute was intended to reach this kind of activity, how do you

10

deal with Organization for a Better Austin, that case, that

11

says even coercive hand billing is entitled to 1st Amendment

12

protection, and what standard do we then apply?

13

MR. COHEN:

The difference is this case arises under

14

the Labor Act, where you have a delicate balance, to use

15

Justice Blackmun's phrase, between the public interests, public

16

interests in precluding this threat of labor discord on one

17

side, public interest, as opposed to the interest in

18

communicating the message.

19

In Better Austin, the opposite was not a public

20

interest, it was a private interest of an individual business

21

man to be free from embarrassment and ridicule.

22

Secondly, in Austin, what you see —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. COHEN:

25

The language was very broad.
That's correct, but it wasn't done by a

labor organization which, here, has many ways to express its
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

message.

2

its message that High did not pay sub-standard wages.

3

communicate that coercively,

4

or boycotting Wilson's.

5

The union here was entitled to go out and communicate
It could

if it wanted to, by picketing High

In Citizens for Better Austin,

there was a blanket

6

injunction which prohibited anyway of communicating that

7

message throughout the whole town that was involved where the

8

real estate broker had his residence.

9

injunction that precluded any spread of the message.

It was a blanket
It was a

10

situation where the only counter-balance to communicating the

11

message was a private message on the part of the broker as

12

opposed to the public interests we have here, which is the

13

public interest of Section 8(b)(4), which is not to enmesh

14

neutral employers in labor disputes of others.

15

That's the counter-balance here.

16

QUESTION:

17
18

And what tests do we employ?

Do we look

for a compelling state interest or what?
MR. COHEN:

We look to the test of whether we're

19

regulating this type of conduct, is there a strong government

20

interest, does the statute directly advance that strong

21

government interest, and does it advance it no further than

22

necessary --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. COHEN:

25

That's correct.

Some commercial speech standard.
It's akin to the commercial speech.

It's analogous to the commercial speech cases.
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

2

Is that a standard applied in the

picketing?

3

MR. COHEN:

It's a standard that was applied in

4

Safeco, we believe, and it's the standard that was applied in

5

Allied, which was not a picketing case.
QUESTION:

6

7

Were there five on that constitutional

holding?
MR. COHEN:

8

9

Allied International.

In Safeco, there were six members of the

Court that reached the constitutional issue.
QUESTION:

0

MR. COHEN:

11
2

QUESTION:

3

MR. COHEN:

And —
And found that that was constitutional.
— that was constitutional.
That's correct.

There were three

4

dissents who did not reach that question because they found it

5

was not covered by the statutes.

6

The key in the constitutional argument in our point,

7

in our opinion,

is that since at least

940,

this Court has

8

said that Congress can set the permissible contact, the limits

9

of permissible contact, that's open to industrial combatants.

20

Where conduct is designed not to coerce and not to communicate,

21

that has always been held to be consistently conduct which this

22

Court can regulate -- which the Government can regulate

23

consistent with the

24
25

st Amendment.

In Safeco, the situation was precisely that we have
here.

The union was attempting to communicate to consumers a
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

message, don't shop or don't do business with the particular

2

employer.

3

The only difference between the two cases is that

4

case involved communication by picketing, this case involves

5

communication by hand billing.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. COHEN, ESQ.

12

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER
MR. COHEN:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

15

What the union is claiming in this case is that it

16

has a constitutional right to do exactly what Congress has

17

forbidden,

18

agree with it.

19

if enough shoppers in the East Lake Square Mall

Congress said thou shall not coerce the neutral

20

businesses in the mall into helping in the dispute with High's,

21

and the union's core claim is that it is constitutionally

22

entitled to put that prohibition to a sort of shoppers'

23

referendum, to issue an explicit call for a secondary boycott

24

and ask the shoppers to decide that the neutral businesses

25

should be coerced after all.
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Some calls for boycott, of course, receive the

2

highest constitutional protection.

3

Citizens for a Better Austin are leading examples.

4

Court has said repeatedly, including in Claiborne Hardware,

5

that the tactics used by the combatants in a particular labor

6

dispute are not entitled to that level of protection.

7

Claiborne Hardware and
But the

In particular, the Court said in Claiborne Hardware,

8

secondary boycotts by labor unions may be prohibited in the

9

interests of preventing the coerced participation of neutrals

10

11

in industrial strife.
Professor Cox put it this way in his comment on

12

Safeco, he said, "requests for immediate assistance in putting

13

economic pressure upon one with whom the speaker is engaged in

14

driving a private business bargain are readily distinguishable

15

from words looking forward to political action."

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Who is being coerced in this case by the

hand billing?
MR. COHEN:

The objects of the coercion in this case

19

are the other stores in the mall who have no relation to any of

20

the parties, either of the parties to the dispute, but who the

21

union felt would be in a position to bring pressure on the mall

22

owner, to bring pressure on their co-tenant, Wilson's, to bring

23

pressure on its contractor, High's,

24

conditions to its employees.

25

QUESTION:

to offer better wages and

That's the coercion the Board identified?
15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR, COHEN:

1

2

It is the coercion of the neutral stores

in the mall, yes.
QUESTION:

3

But how does that coerce in the ordinary

4

sense of the word, other than by the persuasive power of the

5

idea?

6

MR. COHEN:

The coercion takes the form of asking

7

shoppers not to patronize the neutral stores so that the

8

neutral stores will be afraid that they will lose business,

9

unless they become involved in somebody else's dispute and

10

11

enter that dispute on the union's side.
QUESTION:

So, even though the message to the

12

shoppers from the hand bills is not coercive, the result on the

13

neutral stores could be coercive?

14

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

There isn't any requirement of an

15

additional level of coercion.

16

people who are willing supporters of the union, who are merely

17

waiting for the union to give them a signal by the hand bills

18

or picket signs as to what they can do to help.

19

Indeed,

the shoppers may be

What the statute says is that the help that the union

20

may not ask of them is help bringing innocent bystanders, who

21

are merely subject to economic pressure,

22

help the union win it.

23

QUESTION:

into the dispute to

That's the same kind of coercion that

24

would be involved in picketing.

25

MR. COHEN:

It is exactly, we think,
16

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

the same kind of

1

coercion as would be involved in picketing.

QUESTION:

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

5

the shopper,

I think that the —
It's just a difference in the message to

I suppose.

MR. COHEN:

6

In the same degree as well.

I think that the effectiveness of the

7

delivery of the message can vary in a picketing case and can

8

vary in a hand billing case.

9

distribution continuously over a three-week period during the

10

Here, you had a hand bill

Christmas season at all four entrances to a shopping mall.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Cohen,

I asked your Petitioner's

12

counsel whether the issue would be the same as a matter of

13

statutory construction if the communication was in a different

14

form, say a radio or sound truck or something like that, and he

15

said it would be the same statutory issue.

16

Do you agree it would be the same constitutional

17

issue,

18

it's still equally coercive if it is not at the front of the

19

door but, rather, at the front of the shopping mall, as I say,

20

by sound rather than by hand billing or a newspaper ad,

21

something like that?

22

MR. COHEN:

that it would still violate the command of Congress and

We think it is the same constitutional

23

issue.

There are differences between hand billing and other

24

methods of distribution and picketing, but this case doesn't

25

differ in any constitutional-irrelevant respect from,
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

for

1

example, Safeco.
QUESTION:

2

So, you would say it's correct to judge

3

this case as really a pure speech case in which the prohibition

4

is justified entirely on the basis of the message and the

5

audience that's involved?
MR. COHEN:

6

I think it is a case of regulation of

7

tactics which are, by their nature, expressive tactics in a

8

labor dispute.

9

the,

I think the? question is whether this is one of

to quote the Court going all the way back to Thornhill,

10

"one of the permissible limits on the conduct of the disputants

11

in a particular labor dispute".

12

QUESTION:

And you say it's proper for us to judge

13

the case, even though there's absolutely no element of physical

14

concern by the people receiving the hand billing?

15

that there are very large individuals who strike fear into the

16

heart of those.

17

same as if it were very small harmless-looking people doing it?

MR. COHEN:

I think it should be judged on the

19

assumption that this was an effective communication with a

20

message.

I think in that respect, it doesn't differ from

21

Safeco.

Picketing does present some problems that warrant

22

regulation, but the Court has made it very clear more than once

23

that regulation of picketing as such must be content-neutral.

24

If it's constitutional to regulate particular
picketing, solely because it conveys a message, do not shop at

2

labor dispute, that's got to be because it's constitutional to

3

regulate that message however it is effectively delivered.
QUESTION:

4
5

The picketers usually carry the message

anyway.

6

MR. COHEN:

7

QUESTION:

The picketer carries a message.
I mean, something that you can read, not

8

just his conduct carrying the message, but there's signs and

9

manners and -- I suppose.
MR. COHEN:

10

Yes.

One difference is that the message,

11

do not shop, may not be on the picket sign.

The presence of

12

the picketer may imply that message, but, of course, that

13

message was explicit here.
Let me put it a different way in terms of Safeco.

14

I

15

think Safeco would have been easy on the statutory question and

16

it wouldn't have divided this Court six to three on that

17

question if there had been disorder or if there had been a

18

violation of a neutral time, place and manner restriction or if

19

there had been physical or psychological barring of the doors

20

or, indeed, if there had been signalling to other union

21

members'.

22

The Court found the conduct of the Safeco pickets

23

unlawful because, and I'm quoting the Court, "they were trying

24

to persuade the customers of the secondary employer to cease

25

trading with him".

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, GOLD:

7

please the Court:
I wish to begin by recharacterizing what the union's

8
9
10

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

message is in this case from what DeBartolo's counsel said it
was.
The union's message is set out in full in the

12

appendix to the red brief, and the message is not simply that

13

High's, the construction company, pays sub-standard wages; it

14

is that there are a series of relations here between the

15

tenants, the mall owner, Wilson's Department Store, and High's.

16

The relationships are set out, and then the union argues that

17

those relationships, insofar as they support giving business to

18

High's to do the construction, is contrary to some important

19

social interests, buying power of people, community interests

20

in adequate demand along Keansian lines, although there's no

21

citation of that in the hand bill, and argues that given this

22

set of relationships,

23

blame-worthy insofar as they are supporting what High's is

24

doing and how it's treating its employees, and on the basis of

25

that argument, the union asks people to make their judgment,

the mall tenants and the mall owner are

arrangements.
The facts are fairly set out.

3

The message is

4

temperate.

5

misconduct of any kind.

6

the statute at the present time, although it has never so read

7

it before the remand and the decision in this case, is that

8

that message can be obliterated from the face of this country.

9

There was no picketing or patrolling.

No

And the way that the Board would read

Unions may not make that argument to members of the

10

general public who owe the union no fealty and they may not do

11

it no matter what method of communication is used and how the

12

point is made.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Whether it's made at the entrance to the

mall or whether it's a full-page ad in the morning paper?
MR. GOLD:

That is correct.

The union is completely

16

silenced. This is a restraint, a prior restraint on all forms

17

of making this — of communicating this message, this argument,

18

to any member of the public under any circumstance.

19
20

21

QUESTION:
related to the mall?
MR. GOLD:

What if it wasn't?

What if it just

You'd still be making this same argument?
Well, we believe, based on the decisions

22

of this Court that if the statute was directed at leafleting,

23

in other words, if Congress said that the streets are closed to

24

unions that want to communicate this message with this

25

viewpoint, that would be unlawful because leafleting has always
22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

been regarded by this Court from Schneider v. State on as a

2

form of pure speech.
My only point. Justice White, is that I don't have to

3
4

carry that burden.

The argument here is that this message,

5

because it may have an adverse effect on these store owners, if

6

members of the public are persuaded by it, is subject to total

7

ban, and that is the situation we find ourselves in.

8

why we are in the dock, because we have made this argument to

9

members of the general public, and J wish to emphasize in that

That is

cases, if I can call them that, that have come to this Court

12

before,

13

people who have a total absolute right, a freedom may be more

14

accurate, to act on the message without violating any law.

15

this is a situation in which the message is directed at

Congress has not required and has never required, I

QUESTION:

So, this -Bui that's not unusual, Mr. Gold.

Let's

20

take an antitrust case in which a bunch of distributors ban

21

together and go to the manufacturer and they say, we want you

22

to cut off this other distributor because he's selling at too

23

low prices.

24

violation of the Sherman Act.

25

Now, there are those who think that would be in

The manufacturer is entitled to cut off any

distributor he wants to. So, he's entitled to get that kind of

2

information, that kind of urging from the distributors, and,

3

yet, it is made unlawful for the distributors to induce him to

4

do that.
Now, why is that any different from what's at issue

5
6

here?

I mean,

the principle that you can't forbid someone from

7

inducing somebody else to do something that he's perfectly

8

entitled to do is -- it doesn't prove your case.
MR. GOLD:

9

Well, it seems to me that insofar as

10

Congress regulates the underlying actions, you have a different

11

case.

12

of the secondary boycott cases.

13

a group of workers against a neutral employer are banned, and

14

to that extent, if you seek to induce them to engage in

unlawful activity, that is prohibited, but I don't know of any

law which limits the right of individuals acting as individual

which says that a communication advising people of

protection of the right for people to argue and persuade on

You don't think there's any difference

issue that the Court was so conscious of in the OhralIk case in

MR. GOLD:

I don't know whether this interest that is

First of all, in

8

Organisations for a Better Austin, as you raised, if this is a

case which, like that case, is to be judged under the standards

10

applied to speech generally, it seems to us that protecting

these neutrals, these secondary employers and their right to

have any business relationships they want, without anybody

13

knowing about it, and without being able to make their own

14

judgments about whether that's good or bad, is plainly not a

sufficient interest.

13

I don't think that any of this, if I may, would come

14

as any great surprise to the 1959 Congress because the point

15

that given the nature of the discussion with my colleagues I

16

jumped over and very improperly is that it is our position that

17

the Board has misread this statute.

18

The constitutional background is critical to making

19

that argument.

20

reason, but in the first DeBar tolo case, and in the Bishop of

21

Chicago case, the Court has made it plain that there is a

22

presumption that when Congress uses words which could be

23

applied to expressive conduct, that language is to be read

24

narrowly if it is at all possible to do so.

25

So,

Indeed,

I also started as I did in part for that

in Bishop ofChicago, the Court said that
32

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

there had to be an affirmative indication of legislative

2

activity and decided to prohibit it.

4

Certainly, as this Court has made plain many times in

5

the Labor Act context,

the words "threaten",

"restrain" and

6

"coerce" are not words with a single definite meaning, and,

7

reality, what this case comes down to insofar as the Board

8

makes a statutory argument, aside from the fact

9

from a totally erroneous premise and didn't grant us the

in

that it started

10

presumption that the Court stated,

11

there is not only threaten and restrain and coerce in the

12

statute, but there is this publicity proviso which, as the

13

Court said in terms,

14

creates a negative inference and shows that Congress intended

15

in using the words "threaten",

16

this kind of reasoned non-picketing appeal

17
18

is to say that

At that point,

the conference ensued.

understanding what happened in that conference. I was not

10

language could reach not only picketing, which we all agree is

11

subject to a greater degree of regulation, both in the labor

12

and non-labor context since Hughes v._Superior Court was not a

13

case involving a union, but would also reach other forms of

14

expressive activity in the example that President Eisenhower

15

had given in his speech, which was an example involving a

MR. GOLD:

My point is that was the only example ever

raised in the debates, even insofar as the debates talked about
picketing.
QUESTION:

But if the reason for including it is to

show we don’t mean speech to be covered, they wouldn1t have put
in there distributed by another.

They would have just put in

picketing period.
MR. GOLD:

Justice Scalia, I'm not arguing that they

— the issue was either posed or answered in those general
terms.

There was a debate going on. There had been only one

example used. Certainly,

the way you are reading it is the

other fair way of reading the language, that there was a
different discussion than the one I just indicated, namely a
discussion which said there are other situations than the one
than President Eisenhower mentioned and those situations, we do
intend to prohibit other forms of communication.
In other words, that this really was done with malice
aforethought to narrow the provision.
My point is that there are two ways of seeing it
against the background of the overall debate.

Normally, that

would not be of any help to someone attacking a Board decision
reading the language the other way, but we're not in the normal
sitnation.

That is my point.
The presumption is that unless you can show an

dispute with High.

The only message that is being limited is a message

that says injure neutral parties who have no connection

whatsoever with this dispute.

community organizations, other people unconnected with that

So,

there is a difference that this comes up in the

13

context of a labor dispute, because the Labor Act sets the

14

permissible limitations of the combatants in that labor

dispute, and it tells the union, you can predict and you can

Because what's impermissible is not to

impermissible is that they add to that the fact, don't shop at

You don't think the place that this took

MR. COHEN:

14

That's correct.

What's significant is

15

whether the union effectively put pressure on a neutral party

16

to the dispute, whether it enlarged the labor dispute, whether

17

it widened industrial strike.
I think that's illustrated by Safeco because the only

COHEN:

That's correct. Picketing and hand

forbid. When it came out of the conference committee, and there

was a publicity proviso, Congress said you can only engage in
