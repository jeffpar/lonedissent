CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

2

We will hear argument now

in Number 86-1650, Trans World Airlines v. Independent

Federation of Flight Attendants.
Mr. Gartner, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MURRAY GARTNER, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GARTNER:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves union security provisions, which
is another way of saying compulsory payment of union dues.
It is also here, as was the last case, on Petition
for Certiorari to the Eighth Circuit.
For more than a year now, because of the decision of

15

that Court, thousands of flight attendants employed by TWA have

16

contributed more than $2.5 million to the treasury of the

17

union, against their will, and under threat by TWA that if they

18

did not do so, they would lose their jobs.

19

The Court below held that it would be a violation of

20

the Railway Labor Act for TWA to do otherwise, because it said

21

the union has an agreement with TWA pursuant to Section 211 of

22

the Railway Labor Act, which requires TWA to make those threats

23

and which requires those flight attendants to pay those dues.

24
25

The agreement to which the Court and the union point,
however, was part of a contract effective by its terms only

from August 1, 1981 to July 31, 1984.
From 1984 to 1986, TWA and the Respondent Union,

2

3

which I will refer to as "IFFA," were engaged in negotiation

4

and mediation under the auspices of the National Mediation

5

Board, in an attempt to reach a successor agreement.

6

Those efforts were unsuccessful.

7

agreement was made.

8

QUESTION:

9

No successor

No successor agreement is in effect now.
Do I take it then that all issues have

been bargained to impasse?
MR. GARTNER:

10

All issues that were on the table in

11

the sense that the entire agreement was on the table.

12

were a great many issues.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GARTNER:

There is no more bargaining going on?
The only bargaining which is going on,

15

Mr. Justice White, is in attempt to reach an agreement.

16

Whenever the union wants to resume negotiations —
QUESTION:

17

There

But TWA does not challenge the fact that

18

the union is still the collective bargaining agent for its

19

employees?

20

MR. GARTNER:

No, it does not challenge it, because

21

under the statute, really, it has no right to challenge it.

22

There is no procedure under the Railway Labor Act which would

23

allow TWA to initiate a decertification process.

24
25

QUESTION:

So what does the company have to do?

Just

refuse to bargain and then be found guilty of an unfair labor

practice?
MR. GARTNER:

2

3

As Your Honor knows, there is no Unfair

Labor Practice under the Railway Labor Act.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. GARTNER:

But the equivalent.

There really isn't

6

a good answer to that question, Justice White, because there is

7

no comparable procedure under the Railway Labor Act, as there

8

is under the NLRA.

9
10

QUESTION:

So once a bargaining agent is certified,

that is the end of it, that is forever.
MR. GARTNER:

11

Is that it?

That is almost true.

That is almost

12

true.

And the National Mediation Board does not have a good

13

procedure for decertification, certainly not by the employer,

14

and it is very difficult for the employee.

15

QUESTION:

Thank you.

16

MR. GARTNER:

Despite the fact that there is no

17

successor agreement, the Court below held that the union

18

security provisions of the old agreement continue in effect

19

because parts of the prior agreement survive, as the District

20

Court described it, and I quote:

21

bargaining agreement."

22

23
24
25

"...as a mutilated collective

That, as Your Honors know, is not a term known to the
statute or to the art.
The Court below said very little about Section 211,
or the words of this Court, in the Street case, about the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

limited inroads which that section permits, by agreement of the

2

union and the carrier, on the complete prohibition of

3

compulsory dues payment otherwise mandated by Sections 2 Fourth

4

and 2 Fifth.

5

Ignoring that statutory provision, the Eighth Circuit

6

justified the exaction of dues from non-member, permanent

7

replacements and crossovers — that is, people who went to work

8

during the strike and crossed the picket line — during the

9

strike and the continuing self-help period in which we are now,

10

by characterizing the union security simply as an extremely

11

important condition of employment, without regard to what the

12

statute required in order to have that as a condition of

13

employment.

14

QUESTION:

The Court thought that under the terms of

15

the contract, and under the Railway Act, the agreement would

16

continue except with respect to

17

notified the union about?

18

MR. GARTNER:

the changes that the company

Not under the terms of the contract,

19

Justice White.

The Court below was driven by its conception of

20

what the Act required in what it said was its interpretation of

21

the contract.

22

Labor Act required, in terms of bargaining about each single

23

provision, it construed a duration clause which on its face was

24

completely unambiguous and which provided for the non-renewal

25

of the entire agreement, as though it provided for partial

But because of what it believed that the Railway

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7
1
2

renewal of the agreement.
So that the Court was not construing the contract.

3

It was simply using the Railway Labor Act to change the words

4

and the meaning of the contract.

5

QUESTION:

Is your first submission at least that

6

once you gave notice of change pursuant to the contract and

7

Labor Act, and the expiration date of the contract came about,

8

and you exhausted all Railway Labor Act procedures and you were

9

in the self-help phase, the entire contract is over?

10
11

12
13
14
15
16

MR. GARTNER:

That is what the Ninth Circuit held and

that is what we relied upon.
QUESTION:

And thereafter you are completely free to

change any condition of employment without bargaining?
MR. GARTNER:

I do not think that question is before

the Court in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

If you are not free, if there are some

17

provisions you are not free to change without bargaining, how

18

come you are free to change the union security clause without

19

bargaining?

20

MR. GARTNER:

Because the union security clause is

21

the specific subject of a specific provision of the statute

22

which requires an agreement.

23

with and adoption of similar provisions of the National Labor

24

Relations Act, which have been uniformly interpreted to require

25

that union security provisions and on the expiration of the

Heritage

It was enacted in complete accord

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

8
1

contract, regardless of whether all the other provisions of an

2

NLRA contract continue in existence.

3

Now, before the decision below, the first, second,

4

seventh and ninth circuits had recognized that agreements under

5

the Railway Labor Act may expire in accordance with their

6

terms, but that because of Section 6, the conditions

7

established by those agreements nevertheless continue during

8

the status quo period during which negotiations are carried on

9

for the purpose of trying to reach a new agreement.

10

With specific relevance to the question in this case,

11

the Second Circuit, in the Manning case, held that a dues

12

checkoff agreement may expire in accordance with its agreed

13

termination date, but is then continued for the limited status

14

quo period, even though the carrier had not proposed to change

15

it but merely to let it expire.

16

The proposal of the union in that case to include a

17

dues checkoff provision in the new agreement would not seem any

18

different from what the parties here intended.

19

intended to have a union security clause in a new agreement,

20

but not to have a free-floating union security clause without

21

an agreement.

22

Both parties

No court of appeals, until the Court below, has held

23

that after a contract expires and after the conditions it

24

established continue in existence, for, in the words of this

25

Court, the almost interminable status quo period, as the Court

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

9

said in Detroit and Toledo.

2

that parts of the old agreement continue further into the self

3

help period.

4

White —

5

Even under the NLRA, as I have indicated, Justice

QUESTION:

I thought you said that question was not

6

before us here.

7

that proposition not just to the union security provision but

8

to all the provisions of the contract.

9

9

And no new agreement is reached

The way you are talking now, you are expanding

MR. GARTNER:

I agree, Justice Scalia, it is not

10

before you. The only reason I am mentioning it is that

11

Respondent has spent to much time trying to persuade the Court

12

that it is before you and the only point I want to make is that

13

even under the NLRA, where there is some provision about

14

continuing bargaining about other provisions, the very union

15

security provisions which was adopted in the RLA by the model

16

of the NLRA, is held to expire.

17
18

So I will not pay any more attention to that
question.

19

QUESTION:

It seems to me you have to either argue

20

you want to be like the NLRA or you do not want to be like the

21

NLRA.

22

If you want to be like the NLRA, you ought to give up

23

on the proposition that the rest of the contract does not

24

continue but say that nonetheless, the union security provision

25

doesn't continue.

On the other hand, if you want to be different from

I make that statement only with specific reference to
the union security clause.
Section 6 of the Act then required, as the Manning

20

Court in the Second Circuit and as the Ninth Circuit in the

21

Reeve Aleutian case, that all conditions, including the union

22

security clause, be continued during the status quo period.

23

There is nothing in the Railway Labor Act, however,

24

that subsequently transforms that statutory obligation to

25

adhere to that condition od employment embodied in the union

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11
1

security clause, which transforms it into a new agreement after

2

the status quo period has ended.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Gartner, let me just ask this

4

question.

5

Court of Appeals thought that the agreement, even without the

6

aid of the statute, provided for automatic renewal with respect

7

to the provisions that were not the subject of negotiation?

8
9

Is it not correct that the District Court and the

MR. GARTNER:

No, Justice Stevens.

I think it is

very clear in both opinions that the only reason that they

10

reached the decision that they did is that they believed that

11

the statute required there to be contracts in the Railway Labor

12

Act coverage which were interminable and did not have any

13

termination date.

14

This contract had a termination date.

15

QUESTION:

I can understand how you read it that way

16

as support for your position in the language.

17

perhaps quibbling about what the Court of Appeals held.

18
19

They say there were two issues.

But I am just

The District Court

stated there were two issues.

20

One, did Article 28, the duration provision of the

21

contract, cause parts of the contract that were not subject to

22

bargaining to continue in effect, or did notice of certain

23

attendant changes trigger a total termination of the agreement?

24

And he said he answered that a different way than you would

25

answer it.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12

1
2

Then they said the second issue is a statutory issue,
and they don't reach the statutory issue.

3

Maybe they are dead wrong, but it seems to me that

4

they held, if you have just nothing but the language of the

5

contract, that the contract, in a mutilated form, as you put

6

it, did survive.

7
8

MR. GARTNER:

If Your Honor is referring, as I

believe you are, to the Eighth Circuit's decision —

9

QUESTION:

Correct.

10

MR. GARTNER:

11

QUESTION:

Page 4(A).

Page 4(A).

At the bottom the page they start the

12

discussion and they state the two issues.

13

seems to be a contract issue and the second is a statutory

14

issue and they say we only decide the contract issue.

15

MR. GARTNER:

And the first one

But on Page 5, they say, we construe

16

the terms of the duration clause of this agreement in light of

17

the national labor policy enunciated by the Railway Labor Act,

18

which governs airlines as well as railroads, and in light of

19

pertinent decisions

20

into a long discussion about the purposes of the Railway Labor

21

Act and the Florida

East Coast case which dealt with an

22

existing agreement,

no with an agreement which had a

23

termination date or which purported to have a limited effective

24

term.

25

bearing on the issues.

And then they go

And they construe, as they say, they purport to be

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

construing the language of the contract, but they are not

2

construing the language, they are saying that the Railway Labor

3

Act requires this result; and in effect what they are saying

4

is, whatever the parties said, the Railway Labor Act says that

5

you can't do it that way, so we are going to pretend that they

6

did it another way.

7

QUESTION:

8

I agree that they construed it in the light of all these

9

policies you describe.

10

But the bottom line seems to be their

interpretation of what the agreement provided.
MR. GARTNER:

11

*

I just don't read their Opinion that way.

Justice Stevens, I think this is an

12

important point and I would like to dwell on it for a minute or

13

two.

14

Every other Court which has construed a similar

15

contract, which has construed the contract, without the baggage

16

of its interpretation of the Railway Labor Act, have held that

17

this kind of a contract provides for the non-renewal and the

18

termination of the agreement.

19

So the only way that the Eighth Circuit reads the

20

contrary result — and they said specifically, we will not

21

follow the rationale of Reeve Aleutian.

22

The practical effect of the Court's decision offends

23

all reason.

What the Court has done is to say that after an

24

agreed contract term has ended, if a union insists upon

25

striking to attain its new contract objectives, and the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14
1

employer decides to maintain its operations by recruiting and

2

employing permanent replacements, the employer must induce the

3

replacements to come through the union's picket line to work in

4

order to defeat the strike, and in the same breath, tell those

5

permanent replacements and crossovers that they must pay

6

initiation fees to the union — not only dues, but initiation

7

fees -- to the same union which is conducting the picket line

8

so that the union will have the funds to continue the strike.

9
10

That is the effect of the Court's decision.
In the many cases in which this Court has defined the

11

scope of Section 211, and parallel provisions of the NLRA, it

12

has never suggested that without a current agreement, and in

13

the self-help period, 211 permits such a requirement.

14

Nor do I think it needs much argument to establish

15

that if the Unions had asked Congress to pass a law in those

16

words to achieve that objective, that they could have attracted

17

much support.

18

Our submission to this Court is that Congress did not

19

pass such a law with respect to union security clauses, that

20

this Court has not interpreted union security clauses,

21

particularly under the Railway Labor Act, to have that meaning.

22

QUESTION:

Then you do say, Mr. Gartner, that a union

23

security clause in a collective bargaining agreement under the

24

RLA, whatever may be the law with respect to renewal or implied

25

continuance of other such clauses, union security clauses are

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15

1

different because of the special statutory treatment in 211?

2

MR. GARTNER:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But you still hang upon the fact that this

contract terminated, right?

5
6

Yes.

MR. GARTNER:

At least this provision terminated.

This provision terminated.

7

QUESTION:

All right.

But let's assume that the

8

termination provision that you rely upon did not exist and you

9

had a contract that was simply of indefinite duration.

10

The result would seem just as absurd under that

11

contract, too.

12

occurring and those new hires who don't want anything to do

13

with the union are paying the union to try to get them put out

14

of work.

15
16

You would have the same situation of a strike

MR. GARTNER:

I tend to agree with that, Justice

Scalia.

17

This Court has said, in Hanson, in Street, in Allen,

18

and Ellis, that there is a very limited function and authority

19

granted by Section 211, and that that function is to deal with

20

the problem of free riders.

21

QUESTION:

How do you get out of it in a situation

22

where you — and I gather most of the contracts in this

23

industry are not with a fixed termination date as this one. Am

24

I correct about that?

25

MR. GARTNER:

Heritage

No, Justice Scalia.

I think in the

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16

1

airline industry, many contracts are.
As a matter of fact, the amici in their brief say on

2
3

Page 25, I believe it is, that this contract, this TWA

4

contract, is typical of contracts in the airline industry.

5

IN the railroad industry, there is a difference.

6

QUESTION:

All right, but let's assume, whatever

7

industry.

8

gimmick in the statute, I can't rely on 211 in those other

9

situations where the contract, by its own terms, is still in

10
11
12
13

If I can't get out of this situation, if there is no

effect.
So if I am bound to say the absurdity has to exist in
all these other situations, why shouldn't it exist here, too?
MR. GARTNER:

I do not think, Your Honor, that this

14

Court is bound to say that.

This Court has never addressed

15

that question as to whether in those other situations the

16

permission granted by Section 211 allows unions and employers

17

to threaten permanent replacements and crossovers with a loss

18

of their jobs if they don't pay money to support the strike.

19

This Court has never made that decision.

And I think

20

that it is an open question.

21

have to deal with in this case because we fortunately did have

22

a contract which had a termination date.

23

But it is not a question that we

The Respondent prefers not to talk about Section 211

24

or to acknowledge that it is a limited exception to the

25

otherwise complete prohibition of compulsory dues requirements

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

17

in the Act.
Instead, it has directed the Court's attention to

2
3

Section 2 Seventh.

4

would only think it necessary to direct the Court's attention

5

to what the Court itself said in Detroit and Toledo, that 2

6

Seventh is not a status quo provision which has anything to do

7

with a major dispute procedure.
All that Section 2 Seventh does is to provide for the

enforcement of existing agreements and then to call Section 6
into play.

11

Well, Section 6 was called into play in this

12

situation.

13

of the requirements of Section 2 Seventh and Section 6 and

14

those sections have no further application in this case.

15
16

It was in play for two years. TWA complied with all

I would like, if I may, to reserve the rest of my
time.

17

QUESTION:

Before you do, may I ask a question?

18

Assume that you have a rate of pay that is not the

19

subject of negotiation, you have an impasse develop.

20

agree that you are under an obligation to continue to pay the

21

people at the old rate of pay, the contract rate of pay?

22

MR. GARTNER:

Do you

I would go so far as to say that you

23

may not pay more than you have offered during the negotiations

24

because that would be denigrating to the union.

25

Whether you may pay less is I think a question to

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18

which Justice Douglas addressed himself in his dissenting

2

opinion in the Jacksonville Terminal case.
QUESTION:

3
4

if there is an obligation to maintain certain working

5

conditions during the period of impasse, is that a statutory

6

obligation or a contractual obligation?

7

MR. GARTNER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That is a statutory obligation.

So it really is your view, is it not,

then, that the entire contract terminated when you gave
whatever the date period was after the notice?
MR. GARTNER:

11

”

What I really wanted to ask you about is

That is our view, yes, Justice Stevens.

12

That is the view that the Ninth Circuit holds. That is the view

13

that the Second Circuit has expressed.

14
15

QUESTION:

I thought you had taken a different

position in answer to Justice Scalia.
MR. GARTNER:

16

No, I haven't taken a different

MR. GARTNER:

That is what I

It is not an issue before this Court,

because there is nothing in the record which indicates that TWA

made any other changes other than the ones that it had

2

specifically proposed.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Gartner, if it really were the law

4

that some provisions of the contract survive until they are, at

5

least until you have bargained to impasse on them, if that is

6

the law, then you have the problem of distinguishing out this

7

union security provision — which you have tried to do.

8

MR. GARTNER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

So you really have two provisions.

One,

10

the whole contract is over, or two, even if it is not, this one

11

is.

12

MR. GARTNER:

Yes.

That is right. And I would add

13

that the reason that we do not believe that there is a

14

comparable impasse procedure under the RLA as there is under

15

the NLRA is that the RLA imposes such a very long and detailed

16

and specific bargaining duty and procedure —

So that is a substitute for impasse

bargaining.
MR. GARTNER:

Well, but then when you come to the end

of that you are at an impasse on the entire contract.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN A. FEHR, ESQUIRE

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FEHR:

3
4

please the Court:
I would like to start by attempting to clarify some

5

6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

things in the record.
First, the notion that this case was tried upon a

7
8

narrow ground related to the sole change of union security is

9

untrue.

TWA filed this case as a declaratory judgment asking

10

the Court to declare, among other things, that the contract

11

expired.

12

The Court declared the opposite.
In our answer, we specifically alleged twice that TWA

13

could make only those changes which it had submitted to the

14

statutory procedures.

15

is what both Courts held.

16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

And there is no question but that that

That allegation that you repeated, was it

on the contract or statute or what?
MR. FEHR:

The District Court held both under the

statute and under the contract.

20

QUESTION:

But what about your argument?

21

MR. FEHR:

We believe that both under the contract

22

and under the statute, either one or both, you can only make

23

the changes you submitted to the process.

24
25

QUESTION:

So even if there hadn't been a provision

in the contract, about any part of the contract surviving, the

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

21
1

statute itself would say yes, everything survives except what

2

has been submitted for change.

3

MR. FEHR:

That is correct.

4

QUESTION:

What about the provisions that have been

5

submitted for change?
MR. FEHR:

6

I think the only logical reading of

7

Section 6 and Section 2 Seventh is those provisions which have

8

been submitted for change may be altered by the carrier during

9

the self help period.
QUESTION:

10

And if it is wages, why, as soon as the

11

stay put period is over, the employer is free to go up or down

12

on wages?

13
14

MR. FEHR:

The carrier is free to implement the

changes which have been proposed.

15

QUESTION:

right.

16

MR. FEHR:

In which the National Mediation Board has

17

performed its function.

18

it wishes at that time.

19
20

21
22

23
24
25

It is not free to implement any change

In other words, if it proposed $8.00, it cannot
implement $6.00.

But it can implement $8.00.

QUESTION:

But all the other provisions remain

exactly the same?
MR. FEHR:

Provisions which have not been subject to

the bargaining process of the Act may not be altered, yes.
QUESTION:

But it really makes a big difference, at

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

1

least to my understanding of the case, whether the reason any

2

of the terms and conditions may not be changed is a contractual

3

reason or a statutory reason.
As I read the Court of Appeals, they said it was a

4
5

contractual reason.

6

MR. FEHR:

7

They did not reach the question.
The Court of Appeals said that, that is

correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

They did not reach the statutory issue.

9

MR. FEHR:

that is correct.

10

QUESTION:

And if we read the contract otherwise,

11

just read it as a plain, ordinary contract, it seems, by its

12

terms, to expire.

13

unless they serve a notice.
MR. FEHR:

14
15

And they served the notice.

I disagree with that rather strongly, Your

Honor, and the District Court did.

16
17

It says in so many words that it will renew

QUESTION:

I know the District Court read it the

MR. FEHR:

They preferred to express it as to what

other way.

18
19

the parties themselves believed to be the effect of the

20

contract.

21
22
23
24
25

The contract says it renews itself indefinitely
without change unless you give a notice of an intended change.
QUESTION:

Correct.

So that means that if you do

give the notice then it doesn't renew.
MR. FEHR:

Well, but it is somewhat difficult.

Heritage

23

QUESTION:

1
2

Under ordinary grammar.

I don't know

anything about the bargaining history.
MR. FEHR:

3

I think it is rather unusual to construe a

4

notice of a specified intended change to be a signal that you

5

may then make any change you wish whatsoever.
QUESTION:

6

No, that is not the point at all.

The

7

contract in terms says that it shall remain in effect until

8

July 31, 1984, and thereafter shall renew itself without change

9

for yearly periods unless written notice of change is served.

10

Written notice of change was served.

11

renew itself.

13

That is what other courts of appeals have

held, isn't it?

14
15

That is plain language.

QUESTION:

12

Therefore, it doesn't

MR. FEHR:

Absolutely not, Your Honor, other than the

Reeve Court.

16

QUESTION:

Other than what?

17

MR. FEHR:

Other than the Ninth Circuit Opinion in

18

the Reeve case.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

So there is a holding right in your teeth,

MR. FEHR:

But the other courts of appeal which use

I guess.

22

the word "expire" in connection with an RLA contract do not use

23

the word as TWA would use it.

24

to allow the carrier to implement anything and everything

25

during self help.

Heritage

They do not mean expire so as

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

QUESTION:

Are they talking about the statute or are

they talking about the contract?
MR. FEHR:

Most of those cases — there are really

4

only four cases that deal with changes a carrier may make

5

during self help.

6

QUESTION:

I understand.

But to the extent that they

7

read "expire" differently, as you are saying, they may be

8

talking about the statutory effects rather than what the

9

contract itself provides.

10

MR. FEHR:

They mean expire so as to get to the

11

status quo period, expire so as to get to the self help period.

12

There is no case, other than the Ninth Circuit case, that says

13

once you get to self help, anything goes, the carrier can

14

change anything and everything.

15

Perhaps the best example of it is Judge Posner's

16

Opinion in the Seventh Circuit in EEOC v. United when he uses

17

the words "expiration date."

18

"expiration date" he says that the passing of the expiration

19

date does not allow the carrier to implement anychanges.

20

only allows the carrier to implement those which

21

22

QUESTION:

But even as he uses

the words

MR. FEHR:

QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals did not.

MR. FEHR:

The Court of Appeals did not reach the

pure statutory issue.
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Except in construed the contract in light

of the statute.
MR. FEHR:

It did make comments to that effect, yes,

Your Honor.
You should also perhaps look at how both Courts

framed the issue below.

11

issue was framed by both Courts in broad terms as to whether

12

the contract survived both under the statute and under the

13

contract, and the framing of the issues did not even

14

specifically mention union security.

As Justice Stevens pointed out, the

decision 22 years ago by this Court in BRAC v. FEC Railway, and

24

I think we need to talk about that case a little bit.

25

QUESTION:

And that is the

Did you talk about it in your brief?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

26

MR. FEHR:

1

Rather extensively, Your Honor.

2

This is, I believe, the case the Court envisioned 22

3

years ago in FEC when the Court said that it would make a sham

4

of the bargaining and mediation processes of the Act if the

5

carrier could unilaterally achieve what the Act requires be

6

done by the other orderly procedures.

7

And TWA has barely mentioned the rationale of the FEC

8

Court in its brief, and with good reasons, because that

9

rationale really has nothing whatsoever to do with duration

10

clauses in contracts.
The Court talks about the spirit of the ACT.

11

And I

12

think we have to ask and answer the question today of what is

13

the spirit of the Act the Court was talking about in FEC.

14

TWA claims that spirit is that existing agreements be

15

honored.

But that has nothing to do with the rationale of FEC

16

which talks about the community of carrier and employees which

17

is only interrupted by a strike, which talks about a reversion

18

to the jungle if the carrier may use the occasion of a strike

19

to tear up the entire contract, which talks about a carrier

20

using a dispute over limited issues to make sweeping changes

21

that the carrier did not bring to the bargaining table, and

22

which talks about providing the carrier an incentive to provoke

23

or prolong a strike so that it may break the union and simply

24

annul the entire collective bargaining agreement.

25

They key word is "incentive."

Heritage

The purpose of the

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

27
1

RLA, which flows directly from Section 1, is to promote

2

bargaining to the fullest extent possible so as to avoid self

3

help.

4

And what violated the spirit of the Act in FEC was

5

the carrier's interpretation of the ACT, which would have given

6

the carrier a substantial incentive to engage in self help.

7

We have these elaborate processes, what the Court has

8

described as machinery, designed to adjust disputes and avoid

9

self help.

But if the carrier can so easily side step that

10

elaborate machinery merely by submitting some changes to the

11

processes of the Act while hiding others until self help, then

12

those procedures are indeed a shambles.
QUESTION?

13

It is hard to envision that Congress would

14

have intended a scheme under which the working flight

15

attendants here have to finance the union's efforts to displace

16

them.

17
18
19

It is rather strange, isn't it?
MR. FEHR:

The union's primary objective is certainly

not to displace the working flight attendant.
And secondly, Justice O'Connor, that was exactly the

20

result in the FEC case which has been on the books for 22 years

21

and Congress has made no effort to change it.

22

The FEC Court specifically found that a union

23

security provision was a working condition subject to Section 2

24

Seventh of the Act which may not be altered unless there are

25

negotiations over that provision, except in certain instances
«
Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28

1

during a strike, which is certainly not at issue here because

2

the strike was over long before the District Court even ruled.

3

QUESTION:

Did the union insist on collecting the

4

agency fee during the strike?

5

MR. FEHR:

I don't know that, Your Honor.

I only

6

know that union security provisions is one of the issues as to

7

which the carrier attempted to change without bargaining and

8

the Court indicated that you could not do that, except insofar

9

as necessary to operate during the strike.
And the rule of FEC is that the carrier and the union

10
11

must bargain over that which they intend to change.

contrary rule, I submit, the Railway Labor Act simply does not

How effective can the National Mediation Board be, if

17

it is only mediating the changes the carrier has proposed and

18

does not know what other changes the carrier intends to

19

implement during self help?

20

QUESTION:

On the other hand, I really wonder how

21

successful any mediation effort is going to be if you are

22

requiring the carrier, if it wishes to avoid the situation that

23

has occurred here, to put on the table elimination of the union

24

security agreement every time.

25

That doesn't seem to me something that is likely to

produce a quick agreement between the union and the company,

2

and that is the effect of what you are saying.

3

avoid this situation, every time you have to put on the table

4

the first thing we are going to do is eliminate the union

5

security clause.
MR. FEHR:

6

In order to

There are several answers to that, Justice

7

Scalia, the first of which is that that pretty much is the

8

result of FEC.

9

Second, if somehow the carrier cannot operate if it

10

has to enforce the union security agreement during a strike, it

11

can apply to the District Court, as authorized by FEC, for an

12

exception to the requirements of 2 Seventh, which we haven't

13

talked about yet.

14

And third, in fact, TWA has in its proposals issued

15

some provisional proposals that would be in effect only during

16

a strike.

17

in the Joint Appendix, they talk about changing the crew

18

complement, et cetera, in turn, if there was a strike.

19

So I think there are ways to deal with that.

20

QUESTION:

21

If you will examine TWA's opening proposals that are

You mean like a proposal that will only be

operative during a strike?

22

MR. FEHR:

23

I question how often a carrier would submit to

interest arbitration if it knew that in self help immediately

25

following its rejection of arbitration it could obtain far more

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30

1

from self help than the arbitrator could even conceivably

2

award.

3

I also question how seriously a carrier would take

4

the recommendations of a Presidential emergency board when the

5

board will not even address the carrier's hidden agenda for

6

self help.

7

In short, we believe, as the Courts below believe

and

8

as I believe was the message of FEC, that the machinery of the

9

Railway Labor Act only has a chance to work if it is given the

10
11

chance to do so.
With that, I would like to focus for a few moments on

12

the specific language of Section 2 Seventh of the Act and

13

Section 6 of the Act, and of Article 128 of the contract.

14

Section 2 Seventh says, no carrier shall change

15

conditions embodied in agreements except in the manner

16

prescribed in agreements or in Section 6.

17

And the emphasis on changes in conditions in

18

agreements as opposed to just changes in agreements is

19

significant.

20

changes other than by agreement.

21

there will be changes other than by wholesale substitution of

22

Heritage

There is no agreement requiring TWA to

So that leaves us with the question of what changes

3

may be made in the manner prescribed in Section 6.

And Section

4

6 requires that carriers and unions give notice of their

5

intended changes and agreements.

6

So when you may make changes in the manner prescribed

7

by Section 6, is that any change or is that just the changes of

8

which you gave notice?

9

I would submit that the only logical conclusion is

10

that pursuant to Section

I think obviously the

So when a carrier may make those changes of which it
has to give 30 days' notice, what changes are those?
The only logical conclusion it seems to me is that

24

they are the changes which were the subject of the controversy,

25

the changes which were acted upon by the NMB, the changes which

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

32

were the subject of the Section 6 notice.

2

Any other conclusion would simply completely

3

eviscerate the meaning of the words "intended change."

11

There is just nothing in the Act, or in the contract,

12

I believe, that allows, much less requires, such an

13

interpretation, so at odds with the Act's primary objective,

14

which is the prevention of strikes.

This Court has described the RLA as an integrated,

harmonious scheme.

so that the processes of the act will have an opportunity to

20

No less than four sections — Section 2

The position espoused by TWA would make those

21

procedures optional for carriers.

It would allow, as the

22

District Court said, the carrier to opt out of the bargaining

23

process and submit only selective changes or perhaps no

24

changes, if the Union had submitted some, knowing that there

25

are no limitations once self help begins.

has been finally acted upon?

life

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The implication seems to be, that when that proposed

2

change has been acted upon, you can alter not just the matter

3

of that proposed change but rates of pay, rules or working

4

conditions generally.

5

MR. FEHR:

The operative language appears, I believe,

6

in Section 2 Seventh, which says you shall not change

7

agreements except in the manner contained in agreements or in

8

Section 6, which we believe was enacted to say you can only

9

make those changes you submitted through Section 6 procedures.

10

I don't think there is much question but that that is

11

what the Court held in FEC.

12

it in his Opinion in FEC.

QUESTION:

And Justice White pretty well says

That section may just refer to agreements

14

that are continuing beyond, by their terms, beyond the

MR. FEHR:

I find it hard to conceive of the notion

17

that Congress enacted Section 2 Seventh only to deal with

18

contracts that happen to be of indefinite duration without

19

saying this section shall apply to contracts that are only of

20

indefinite duration.

21

A more logical conclusion is that the statute was

intended to say, you shall not have contracts with what the

where every change, every part of the contract, completely self

MR. FEHR:

2

All they have to do is issue a

bargaining process and let the NMB submit its statutory

5

function in that regard.

10

I mean, that is clearly allowed.

That is

The agreement itself can provide for a

change.

11

MR. FEHR:

Sure, if an agreement says in Year One you

13

is a change in a manner prescribed in an agreement.

14

there is a new agreement that says you will be paid $10.00.

15

That is a change in a manner prescribed in an agreement.

I think to give any comfort to TWA, the contract

That is not

The theme of the Act seems to be clearly that you

8

Otherwise, a carrier can submit a single change to the

9

bargaining process, wait for self help and then change anything

10

it wishes.

And there was not a single change proposed here,

11

but there were many, many changes made other than those which

12

were the subject of the Act's statutory procedures.

13

Right along the lines of the FEC Opinion, it really

14

has made a sham of the Act, to say there can be no bargaining

15

over union security or the grievance procedure or many other

16

things, but that as soon as self help comes, we are going to

eliminate them.
