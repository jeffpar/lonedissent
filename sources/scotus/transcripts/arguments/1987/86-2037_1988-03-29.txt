ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
This case involves a subsection in the Union Shop

12

provision in the Railway Labor Act, Section 2 Eleventh (c)

13

passed in 1951 which differs significantly from that in the

14

Labor Management Relations Act as it relates to operating

15

employees only on this nation's railroads comprised of

16

engineers, firemen and hostlers, conductors and trainmen.

17

On its fact, Section 2 Eleventh (c) permits

18

satisfaction of a negotiated union shop agreement with one of

19

the two remaining operating craft unions by membership in the

20

other, the minority union.

22

railroad operating employees clear beyond doubt.

In February,

1984, while working as a passenger

According to what had been his experience, particularly on

Conrail, and while working for Conrail providing Amtrak

His request was denied by the carrier, Aintrak, because the

bargaining agreement had an exclusive representation clause

with regard to on-property investigations and with regard to

by any of the ordinary material benefits of membership.

QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, I wonder whether the Court in

8

the Pennsylvania Railroad case didn't take a much more limited

9

view of Section 2 Eleventh (c) than you are advocating here.

10

thought the Court said it had a very narrow and limited

11

purpose?

12

MR. MILLER:

I

Justice O'Connor, I would agree that

13

there was much discussion about the limited purpose to

14

eliminate the problem of free riders, but I would point out

15

that the issue that was in front of the Court was itself a very

16

limited one at that time.

that UROC, the brand new union, was not a union that was

qualified to be available for alternate membership.

a much broader interpretation of that section than I thought

21

the Court had given it.

22

MR. MILLER:

Justice O'Connor, I guess all I can say

23

in response is that I don't believe that the Court was required

24

to go as far as we are seeking here because of the limited

25

issue that was involved.

But I do think that --

QUESTION:

1

Well, do you think that Section 3 First

2

would possibly take precedence here in telling us what to do on

these specific grievances?
MR. MILLER:

No, Justice O'Connor, I don't, because I

For that reason, I do not believe that Section 3

15

control of the carrier and the organizations on the property

(202) 628-4888

1

2

agreement with the carrier required that the employee use the

3

union's form only to make the revocation.
This Court found no support in either the plain

4
5

meaning of the statute itself or in the legislative history to

6

support such a view, and therefore invalidated that provision.
And I might note that in so invalidating that

7
8

provision, this Court in Felter specifically recognized that

9

one of the reasons an employee may revoke was to give effect to

the second proviso of subsection 2 Eleventh (c) which was left

open for solicitation by the remaining two rival unions.

If there is to be the full exclusivity that is

present in the LMRA and with regard to non-operating employees

5

to be applied in this case, we would submit that that is for

6

the Congress to decide.

7

It is a policy matter.

There was no dispute even by the court below that the

8

petitioner in this case had an absolute right to alternate

9

membership.

And although the court below recognized his

10

legitimate interest in having his own union establish the

11

record at the most critical moment of employment leading to

12

discipline on the property, it effectively overrode that

13

legitimate interest by applying exclusivity principles from an

14

Act in this case clearly not an analogous.

I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROSS:

20
21

22

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
The respondents, Amtrak and the Brotherhood of

23

Locomotive Engineers cannot agree with the petitioner's

24

position that one may weave out of the fabric of the alternate

25

union membership provisions in Section 2 Eleventh a suit that

restrictive provision, however, does not mean that the

collective bargaining representative may act arbitrarily at the

individual a full and fair hearing, or deny him consideration

13

of his grievance.
The former would permit an action against the union

for a breach of its duty of fair representation.

would permit the arbitrator, in this case, the First Division

10

11

QUESTION:

I'm talking about that

And is there any representation at any

other level?
MR. ROSS:

Once it goes beyond that level, then the

12

individual, as Mr. Miller indicated, may represent himself

13

before the arbitrator, the First Division of the National

14

Railroad Adjustment Board, or he may be represented by any

15

union of his choice, or by an attorney.

16

QUESTION:

Of his choice.

17

MR. ROSS:

But I'm drawing the distinction here that

18

at company level proceedings, the collective bargaining agents

19

may enter into a provision which restricts access to that

20

grievance procedure to the individual himself or to the

21

certified collective bargaining representative, which in this

22

case, would be the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

23

That system is analogous to the system of grievance

24

handling under the National Labor Relations Act, except

25

contrary to what is done in other industries, the individual

17

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

may handle his own grievance at these beginning stages on the

2

property handling.

3

And as I was going to say, not only does the

4

individual have a right to bring an action against the union if

5

it breaches its duty of fair representation in arbitrarily

6

acting against him in these beginning stages, but in addition

7

to that, if the employer denies the individual a full and fair

8

hearing or refuses to consider a claim or grievance, the First

9

Division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board may set

10
11

aside the action that was taken by the carrier.
And we submit that there are three basic fundamental

12

premises that uphold the right of the collective bargaining

13

representatives to enter into such restricted access to the

14

grievance process.

15

The first reason is is that judicial interpretations

16

of the National Labor Relations Act, and also the Railway Labor

17

Act, do not sanction minority or rival union representation in

18

the processing of claims and grievances.

19

The second reason is, contrary to what petitioner

20

asserts, the language of the Railway Labor Act does not promote

21

minority union handling of grievances at the company level.

22

a matter of fact, if I may make an aside here, Congress

23

specifically knew how to use language, as recognized by the

24

As

2

language that it did in Section 3 First (j) of the Railway

Labor Act.

4

Insofar as company handling, on-the-property

5

handling, it used different language and that language was, the

6

usual manner of handling up to and through the chief operating

7

officer of the railroad designated to resolve or adjust

8

grievances.

9

We submit, and this would be consistent with all the

10

cases that have been cited by the petitioner, that where you

11

have a usual manner here with a railroad that came into

12

existence with its own employees on January 1, 1983, and

13

entered into agreements with all of the unions providing for

14

exclusive handling of their grievances by the certified

15

collective bargaining representative or by the individual, that

16

that becomes the usual manner of handling on that property.

17

And therefore the Court would never have to reach the

18

other issues that have been raised in this case, although we

19

think that the First Circuit was correct when it ruled that

20

operating employees of railroads, just as employees covered by

21

the National Labor Relations Act, and also employees who are

22

considered to be non-operating employees, are no different.

23

That under those circumstances, as I indicated previously and

24

as accepted by leading scholars of the labor law, the

25

collective bargaining representatives enjoy this peculiar

relationship in devising a grievance procedure for on-the-

property handling.

3

And as a result of that, in this case, Amtrak and the

4

Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had a right to enter into

5

such an agreement and they did do so, and they've applied it

6

consistently.

have consistently applied in the crafts that they represent,

10

And as a matter of fact, the United

In addition to the specific language of the Railway

11

Labor Act which we assert does not promote minority union

12

handling of claims and grievances, we also submit that both the

13

1934 amendments to the Railway Labor Act, and also the 1951

14

Union Shop Provisions had as their sole purpose the elimination

15

of labor turmoil and the promotion of stability of industrial

16

relations in the railroad industry by the elimination of

17

competition between unions.

18

That proposition was stressed a number of times in

19

the 1934 hearings, both by the draftsman of the legislation,

20

Commissioner Eastman, Joseph Eastman, and also by the chief

21

spokesman for labor, George Harrison, who was the President of

22

the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, and also

23

Chairman of the Railway Labor Executives Association.

24

The very purpose of the Section 2 rights and Section

And both those gentlemen said that maybe we

should open it up, so that you could have minority unions

For the purposes of deciding this case,

Justice Scalia, I don't believe that the Court has to go that

far.

19

believe that when one sits down and reads the legislative

20

history of the 1951 Union Shop Amendments and knows anything

21

about the railroad industry, it was never intended that that

22

language was to go beyond the temporary transfer.

23

I'm saying in response to Mr. Miller's comments that I

have to deal with that because Section 2 Eleventh (c) has

25

nothing to do whatsoever with grievance handling.

And as I've indicated, Mr. Harrison, the chief

spokesman on Union Shop indicated that.

As a matter of fact,

3

neither of the respondents, no one has ever cited to a

4

statement that Mr. Harrison made in the Senate Committee

5

Hearings on the Union Shop Amendments, but he stated at page 16

6

of those 1951 hearings that if the Union Shop Amendments were

7

passed, the grievance procedure will cease to be a battleground

8

for rival unions; his language, not mine.
And I suggest that actually that was the intent and

9
10

purpose of 2 Eleventh, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with

11

grievance handling.
Unless the Court has any questions, I think that all

12

13

I have to say is that the cornerstone of the Federal labor

14

policy has been majority rule.

15

the Railway Labor Act case of Virginia RR v. System Federation

frequently, that Court went so far to accept an argument of

2

Professor Cox of Harvard Law School, and stated that the

3

collective bargaining representatives covered by the National

Labor Relations Act could, by collective bargaining, eliminate

5

not only a minority union handling grievances and arbitrations

6

of employees' claims under that Act, but they could, go so far

7

as to eliminate an employee having the individual right to

8

confer with the employer concerning the claim or grievance.

There's a very complex scheme of Federal labor policy

10

that has evolved over the years.

There are rights that the

I've indicated two of those rights

13

In addition to the two that I mentioned, the duty of

14

fair representation, and also the ability of the arbitrator to

15

set aside the carrier's failure to allow an individual a full

16

hearing, we also know that Section 2 Ninth of the Railway Labor

17

Act was inserted so that if a group of employees was

18

dissatisfied with the majority representative, they had a way

19

under the procedures before the mediation board to do away with

20

that union.

21

We also know, as this Court emphasized in several

22

cases including NLRB v. Allis Chalmers, that there have been

23

other statutory limitations or provisions for the protection of

24

individuals and among those would be the Lander and Griffin Act
