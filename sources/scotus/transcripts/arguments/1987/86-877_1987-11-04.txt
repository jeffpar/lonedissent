ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court, the issue in this case is whether the confrontation

clause of the Sixth Amendment or the Federal Rules of

10

Evidence bar the admission of a witness ' s prior identification

11

of his assailant on the ground that at the time of the trial

12

the witness had suffered a loss of memory concerning the facts
of the assault.

14

Now, the facts of this case are as follows.

The

15

case arose from a prosecution of the respondent Owens, who is

16

a federal prisoner, for assault against a federal correctional

11

officer, John Poster, at the

18

California.

20

head and arms of Foster that left him with verv severe

23

which time he suffered periods of qroqqiness and virtual

24

incoherence, but nurinq some period of which he was relatively

25

lucid and coherent, particularly towards the end of the

Lompoc

Penitentiary in

period, in fact, on 11ay 5th, 1982, Foster was visited by an

2

FBI agent, who interviewerl him to determine as much as he

could about the events of the assault.

4

according to both Foster's testimony at trial and according

5

to the FBI agent ' s testimony , Foster qave, a · statement that

6

described in great detail all the events l eading up to the

7

assault and the facts of the assault , including identifying

8

the respondent Owens as his assailant .

and then he also picked Owens out of a photo lineuo as his

What he

was unable to say, and this is a mark in a sense of the

precision of his testimony, was that he was able to sav, no,

MR. BRYSON:

right.

In this casP., however,

we would be content -- we think it is possible for this court
to decide, if the court wants to, that Rule 605 is satisfied.
On the other hand, since Judge Boochever in dissent felt, as
did the majority, that Rule 602 was not satisfied, it may be
necessary in this case

the Court may prefer to send the

case back to the Court of Appeals for further development
of the Rule 602 issue, which in Judge

view would

have required a further remand to the Oistrict Court, and we
wou!dn't have any objection to that, althouqh I would like
to point out a few facts that would support a finding and
indeed do support a finding of the District Court that
602 was satisfied, one of which is that the testimony that
owens gave from the stand and testimony that was in his
statement that he jammed bis finqer into the .chest of his
assailant, which sugqests that he was fating his assailant.
Number 2, the location of his injuries.

His injuries

were on the front of his body, and they

were injuries to the

side of nis head and injuries to his

arms, which

were obviously in a defensive posture, indicating ne was
facing his assailant.
He commented that he knew that - - or helieved that

24

because of its size, and that indicates that he must have

However, I

do think there is an a!Tlple basis on which the Court either
could reach that question or the Court of Appeals could
dispose of it either on their own or the issue could be
disposed of by the District Court on further

is what Judge Boochever would have sugaested .
Now, the District Court admitted the evidence that
was offered, which is the out of court statement made by
Mi:v

Foster on May 5th o n the qround that Foster was there,

available for cross examination, and therefore the confrontation clause and Rule 80l(b) (1) (C), which is the rule
that is designed to permit orior identification testimony in

availability for cross examination .

12

Now, in our view , based on these principles, we

would say that the confrontation clause is satisfied if,

Number One, the scope of the cross examination is not

worse than it is when you are talking about a witness who

3

is t estifying about matters that he observed that he is

4

testifying in court but ha s suffered loss of memory with

respect

to those matters..

6

He concedes for the most part, I think, that there

7

is no violation of the confrontation clause if , as in a case

8

such a s t h is Co u rt ' s deci sion in Delaware a g a inst Fensterer,

9

the witness simply has a shaky memory as to some events as

10

to which he is testifying . Even if there is a substantial

11

loss of memory on the part of the witness so that the witness

12

as, again, in Delaware aqainst Fensterer , says, well, I

13

know what my opinion is but I can ' t remember any of the

14

reasons why I reached that opinion, because he is testifying

15

about his current opinion in Court, the

16

that is different from this case, where the witness is not

testifying about his in court observations , or is testifying

18

about h i s observations , whil e he is standi ng there is

19

present recollection of his observations while he is in court,

20

but is testifying about an out of court statement.

says,

In our view, there is no such clearcut line to

be

drawn between an out of court statement and in court testimony

MR. BRYSON:

We rely on it, Your Honor, because we

think the analysis, while the question was clearly left
open, we think that the analysis of Fensterer is helpful in
indicating the way that that question should be answered.

we

certainly concede that that question has been left open and
this Court has never answered the question, but we do think
that features of Fensterer suqqest the answer that this Court
should reach.
The difference, the absence of any significant
difference between the two kinds

of statements it seems to

me is perhaps best pointed out by the followinq example.
Suppose I am walk i ng down the street and someone comes out of
a bank wearing a mask.

QUESTION:

Mr . Bryson, can I

you a question about your hypothetical?

You do agree, I take

4

it, that the associate who heard you say 'That ' s Jones"

5

could not testify to that fact?

No, we would think that the

7

would be our contention that that associate could testify as

the Courts of Appeals as to exactly how much recollection

10

Well, to the extent admittedly

11

critical , then why is this any differept than had OWens

13

MR. BRYSON:

Because there is so much more that

14

can be done with Foster on the stand, available for cross

15

examination, than if Foster were not there .

16

such matters as his bias.

17

true in this case, but suppose he had been trying to get

18

Owens for months, and Owens knew

19

to his attorney, that this was -- that his attorney could

20

try to make use of that fact to impeach Foster ' s testimonv

21

on the grounds of bias, something that would have been much

22

harder to do if Foster were not present .

Similarly , the question of Foster's credibilitv can

24

be probed, whether his demeanor suaqested that he was a

25

careful person or a person who was quite careless, the

inconsistency, for that matter, between features of the
statement that he made and 11ansfield' s testimony about his
statement would have been a fruitful line of cross
examinat.lon.

It is true, to be sure, that none of these lines

'.lat

of cross examination were pursued in this case, but that is

n

only because Foster did such a qood job and was such a

c

believable witness .
This was somebody who was not easily impeached, not
because there was any impairment -- the hosoi tal .

Foster had

il
in

not been able to identify his assailant, or had suggested,
asked a question, was it Leo who hit me -- there was another
inmate in the penitentiary whose name was Leo , as established
by defense counsel , and that was made the basis of the
suggestion that in fact the Owens idea came up late in the
day and wasn't the product of his observation at all.
So there was a lot that could be done and there
was

some fair-amount that actually was done by virtue of

having Foster there, even though his

memory had, as you say,

died with respect to the question of identity.

But, Your

Honor, memory dies like that a lot in these kinds of cases,
not just cases of trauma where the person ' s memory

be

thought to have died because he was hit on the head, but in
cases that come up every day where a bank teller, let ' s say

I would like to just mention a couple of points on

21

the factual statements the qovernment made, the fact that

it was a pipe, that he saw that it was a pipe somehow

23

indicates that he saw what was qoinq on.

24

was that "I heard something hit my head and it sounded like

25

a pipe," that doesn ' t indicate that he saw anybody.

Well, the testimony

So the fact that he could say, yes , Owens struck me ,

For example, the government tells us that clearly

as in Douglas versus Alabama , that would violate the confron-

10

Clearly, if a court, as in Davis versus

Alaska, restricts the ability to cross examine a witness

with respect to impeachment, that would be a violation of

the confrontation clause.

I disagree respectfully, Justice

I think this opinion can be written very

narrowly, and I

think this Court has created a basis for a very narrow
opinion here.

In a number of cases the Court has said, in

only the most extraordinary case where there has been
questioning of the witness will we inquire into effectiveness,
and by the way, effectiveness is not our standard.

It is a

standard derived from this Court's cases, beqinning with
California versus Green , so there must be

some substance to

it, and I think this Court can establish that this is an
extraordinary case by first indicating its close relationship
to cases such as Douglas versus Alabama and navis versus
Alaska.

It seems to me that this r.ourt -- this case

I think from a practical lawyer ' s point of view,

whether you are talking about a prosecutor or a defense

18

attorney, if you

19

know-, I really couldn ' t effectively cross examine someone

20

who had so complete a memory loss as to the most critical
