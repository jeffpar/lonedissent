ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT, ESQUIRE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. BRIGHT:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

Thank you very much.

11

the matter which is before the Court now is a habeas corpus

12

case that is on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the

13

Eleventh Circuit.

sentence petitioner.

in Putman County, Georgia, in November of 1977, some two

16

months after the incident for which he was charged •••'■'r,h, he

and his two co-defendants were charged with the crime.

My client, Tony Amadeo,

Where is Putnam County, what part of

it is not far from Macon, Georgia,

More in the central part of the

QUESTION:

Below the Nat Line?

MR. BRIGHT:

Right about on the Nat Line, Your

2

Honor.

3

trial, the prosecutor, the district attorney said that you

4

probably couldn't find a fair jury anywhere in the State of

5

Georcria than you could find in Putman County.

6

was the only one who knew at the time he made that statement

7

that he had earlier that same year directed the jury

8

commissioners in Putnam County to underrepresent black people

9

and women in the master jury lists from which Tony Amadeo1s

10

grand jury and trial juries were chosen.

11

And ah the start of the penalty phase of Mr. Amadeo1s

Of course, he

It was unknown that at that time he had put forward

12

this plan, these instructions to the jury commission for the

13

purpose of making it appear that racial discrimination had

14

been eliminated while actually perpetuating racial discrimi­

15

nation and discrimination on the basis of gender and

16

insulating it from judicial review.

17

Ten months after Mr. Amadeo's trial this scheme

18

came to light when another lawyer in another case

19

inadvertently came across it.

He attempted to raise it to

20

the Supreme Court of Georgia.

That Court rejected his claim,

21

saying it came too late.

22

District Court below, and that court granted habeas corpus

23

relief, finding cause that the claim was not reasonably

24

available to Mr. Amadeo and his lawyers at the time because

25

it was concealed and unknown to them because of the district

He later presented it to the

attorney's deception.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Bricrht, the District Court here

3

concluded that petitioner's counsel at the time -- that

4

wasn't you, I guess.

5

MR. BRIGHT:

6

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Did not deliberately bypass the

7

constitutional challenge to the composition of the master

8

jury list.

9

MR. BRIGHT:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, what evidence is there in the

11

record to support that finding in the face of what appears

12

to be defense counsel's testimony to the effect that defense

13

counsel considered challenging the jury list, thought they

14

could win such a challenge, but chose not to raise it in

15

order to preserve what they thought was a favorable jury?

16

MR. BRIGHT:

Your Honor, that was one of two

17

factual determinations that the District Court made which

18

the Eleventh Circuit rejected.

19

if you look at the one lawyer's testimony that is highlighted

20

throughout the state's brief, it gives a view of this case

21

of a tactical decision that was made.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Basically the District Court,

The District Court --

And he was only one of -- more than one

counsel, was he not?
MR. BRIGHT:

He was one of two counsel, right, and

they were appointed to represent both Mr. Amadeo and the two
Heritage Reporting Corporation

5

1

co-defendants in all three of these cases, but the District

2

Court looked at the totality of the circumstances and clearly

3

did not credit that testimony, because the District

4

QUESTION:

Well, tell me, please, where we look in

5

the record to find something to support the District Court's

6

contrary view.

7

MR. BRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The District Court's

8

finding, of course, was that the lawyers would have brouaht

9

the claim had they known about the district attorney's

10

involvement in this scheme to eliminate or to linit black

11

people and women on the jury.

12

QUESTION:

Right, and you had explicit testimony

3

by the lawyer saying that we like this jury, we didn't think

4

we could get a bettery jury.

5

what, nine, eight or nine women, which they thought was

6

highly desirable.

7

MR. BRIGHT:

We liked it because it had,

The ultimate jury.

Now, of course,

8

the lawyers said that what they did was, they got the venue

9

list, that is, the people chosen from the master list for

20

the petit jury in that trial, and they looked at that before

21

trial, and saw that there were women and black people

22

represented there.

23
24
25

Of course, that's exactly what the district
attorney's scheme was designed to accomplish.
QUESTION:

I think you are being whipsaw.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You

6

1

are getting several questions -- I think you were in the

2

process of answering Justice O'Connor's question, which was

3

about where in the record do we look to find evidence that

4

the District Court could have based a finding on.

5

MR. BRIGHT:

Yes, and there are a number of

6

sources of that that they would have brought the challenge,

7

and let me go through those, if I may.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRIGHT:

Would you go with pages to the record?
Yes, Your Honor.

I will be happy to.

10

First of all, the lawyer's testimony which we were talking

11

about there and relates to this point is that they liked that

12

particular jury.

13

contradicted that was all the contemporaneous evidence, the

14

first thing being, Your Honor, the fact that the lawyers

15

filed a motion to continue this case October the 27th and

16

filed an affidavit saying that there was so much prejudice

17

against Mr. Amadeo and his co-defendants that the trial should

18

not be held until the next term of court, which would have

19

been before a different jury.

20

What the District Court had that directly

In addition, the lawyers filed a motion for a

21

change of venue which was. I itiaated right through the jury

22

selection process, and they argued in that motion that a

23

large portion of the jurors had an opinion about the guilt of

24

Mr. Amadeo and therefore that they should not try the case

25

before that particular jury.

and I would point the court to Pages 16 to 18, and I might

6

mention to respond to the Chief Justice on the page cites --

7

Those were two of the three motions, which were to

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

In their brief to the

Before you no on, all of

8

those motions would have produced not just a different jury

9

here and now, but a different jury elsewhere, right, or a

10

different jury at a different time?

11

MR. BRIGHT:

The continuance motion would have

12

produced a different jury but in the same county.

13

motion, of course, would have moved the case out of Putnam

14

County in a completely different venue.

IS

contradict this testimony that the lawyers -- of course,

16

this was -- when they testified, this one lawyer that has

17

been alluded to, ten years after the fact the claim of

18

ineffective assistance of counsel, when this allegation was

19

made that we really liked this jury so much, we would have

20

done anything to keep it, even forfeit a constitutional

21

claim.

The venue

Both of these

22

In addition, and I was going to say, both --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

There was that testimony by one of the

defense lawyers?
MR. BRIGHT:

Well, of course, they didn't know they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

8

1

had this claim.

2

All they said was --

QUESTION:

Right, but there was testimony, I

3

thought, by at least one of them to the effect that we

4

considered a constitutional challenge to the master list,

5

thought we might have won it, but we bypassed it because we

6

thought we had a favorable actual jury.

7

can find that in the record.

8

MR. BRIGHT:

Is that right?

We

Yes, you can find that he said this.

9

He didn't actually know that there was a factual basis for

10

the claim.

11

discrimination that went on in that part of Georgia that if

12

we had probably looked we probably would have found something,

13

and we didn't look.

14

that's much different, knowing that you might undertake in

15

the two months you have to prepare three capital trials --

16

His testimony was, we thought there was so much

QUESTION:

That's what he testified to.

Okay.

All right.

Of course,

Now tell me, please,

17

where we find in the record something contrary to that

18

statement on which the District Court might have made its

19

f inding.

20

MR. BRIGHT:

All right.

I think the District Court

21

made its finding based upon the contradiction based upon

22

what I've already talked about, the brief that those lawyers

23

filed in the Georgia Supreme Court --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BRIGHT:

That was after they had lost the trial.
Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
ilM

9

1

QUESTION:

I mean, that is quite a different

2

context to sav then, sure, you are going to do anything

3

you can to upset the verdict, but their testimony was of

4

this quy's opinion before the trial, wasn't it?

5

MR. BRIGHT:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, yes.

He was testifying afterwards, but he

was giving his point of view before the trial.

8

MR. BRIGHT:

9

QUESTION:

10

No, Your Honor.

That's what he testified to.
Well, yes, that is all we are saying,

is that that's what he testified to.

11

MR. BRIGHT:

12

QUESTION:

Right.
So testifying different, taking a

13

different position after you've lost the trial really is not

14

a contradiction.

15

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, if it's a different

16

position, the fact that it was taken after the trial may be

17

an explanation for it, but it is a contradiction. It was

18

one of those contradictions that the District Court had to

19

resolve in making its factfinding.

20

I'm not saying that there's not a plausible view

21

of the evidence that can be taken in the state's brief or

22

in the Eleventh Circuit opinion, but the District Court is

23

entrusted with the factfinding responsibility under Rule 2,

24

and the District Court not only considering the things that

25

I've talked about but also considering the testimony of the

lawyers at the time they found out, ten months later after

this trial when this district attorney's involvement in

to light, the testimony of the two lawyers then of the shock,

MR. BRIGHT:

is somebody who said he was talking to one of the lawyers.

MR. BRIGHT:

And he said that that lawyer said --

what were the exact words?

23

MR. BRIGHT:

but I believe that --

25

Right.

QUESTION:

How did he say it?

I'm not sure if I have the exact words,

Well, I think it's -- here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

11

1

MR. BRIGHT:

-- Mr. Jernigan was asked if lie

2

recalled Mr. Lambert saying, had they known about this claim,

3

would they have raised it, and Mr. Lambert said that they

4

would have, and that's at the bottom of Page 59, the top of

5

Page 60 of the Joint Appendix.

6

QUESTION:

Well, it says -- is .it the quote that

says, "Well, I can't say specifically.

8

me what he would have done.

it was" —

No, it's the one that says,

"If I had

11

known about this jury issue prior to trial I would have

12

raised it."

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRIGHT:

I can't find it.

Where is it?

The quote is, and this is at the

15

bottom, Justice Scalia, of Page 59, "Mr. Jernigan, do you

16

recall Mr. Lambert ever saying, if I had known about this

17

jury issue prior to trial I would have raised it," and then

18

on the next page, "Yes, I recall that.

19

been a great issue,

20

about it."

He said it would have

I would have raised it if I'd known

21

And again, the Eleventh Circuit in Footnote 9 of

22

its opinion acknowledged a direct conflict in the testimony

23

here.

24

to do was to look at the totality of the circumstances, not

25

just what one lawyer testified to ten years after the fact,

What the District Court under Rule 52(a) was required

Heritage Reporting Corporation

12

1

but to look at the totality of the circumstances.

2

contemporaneous evidence, I would submit,

3

for the District Court's finding.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Bright,

^he

indicates support

let me ask, wasn't Mr.

5

Jernigan speaking about statistical disparity when he made

6

that statement?

7

MR. BRIGHT:

No, he was speaking when he made that

8

statment that I just quoted, Justice Blackmun, he was talking

9

about the prosecutor's memorandum that indicated that he had

10

designed a plan to limit blacks and women and avoid a prima

11

facie case by —

12
13

QUESTION:

I'm trying to help you out, but I guess

I'm not doing it.

14

MR. BRIGHT:

15

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
I thought he was speaking of the

16

statistical disparity, and that that was what he shied away

17

from, which to me is very different --

18

MR. BRIGHT:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes.
-- than allegations of a challenge of

an intentional discrimination.
MR. BRIGHT:

Exactly.

I'm sorry.

I did mis­

22

understand, and that's the, point, of course, the dissent makes

23

in the Eleventh Circuit, that whatever the lawyers might have

24

been thinking about at the time of the trial, because the

25

facts had been withheld from them/ was not the claim which was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

13

1

here, that their adversary, the district attorney, who under

2

Georgia law has no responsibility to interact with the jury

3

commission at all. The jury commission is to receive its

4

instructions from the Superior Court judge and only from the

5

Superior Court judge.

6

QUESTION:

If this is true, I think it utterly

7

destroys this talk about what Jernigan said as being some­

8

thing that there is no answer to.

9

answer to it in the record.

10

MR. BRIGHT:

I think there is a complete

Yes, Your Honor.

And I would point

11

as well as another basis for the District Court's finding,

12

without going through each part of it, the brief that was

13

filed in the Georgia Supreme Court at pages 16 to 18 of the

14

Joint Appendix, with regard to how this claim was first

15

found and what the lawyer did upon finding it, and with

16

regard, Justice O'Connor, to the question about deliberate

17

bypass, I think, as the District Court found, the evidence in

18

thi.s case was that once this was discovered, once the pro­

19

secutor's actions here were discovered,

20

presented to the state courts as promptly as it could possibly

21

have been presented, and the Georgia Supreme Court declined

22

to entertain the claim, but that these lawyers basically did

23

all that they could possibly do.

24
25

i.t was immediately

I would point out that when the District Court
heard this it took into account the briefs and the
Heritage Reporting Corporation

14

1

continuance motion which were marked and made a part of the

2

evidence, all of that was part of the factfinding process, and

3

I would suggest that under Anderson versus Bessemer City,

4

Pullman-Standard, and the other cases that this Court has

5

decided, that the Eleventh Circuit could not reject that

6

factfinding without making a finding that it was clearly

7

erroneous, and I would point out -QUESTION:

8
9

Do you interpret the District Court's

opinion as finding that the trial lawyers were not credible?
MR. BRIGHT:

10

I think he resolved conflicting

11

evidence to come to the conclusion that they would have

12

raised the claim had they known of this constitutional

3

violation, that the district attorney was engaged basically

4

in a criminal conspiracy with the jury commissioners to limit

15

the participation of blacks and whites.
QUESTION:

6

So that their statement that they made

7

a deliberate, knowing waiver of the jury challencre is not

8

credible?
MR. BRIGHT:

9

Well, two points on that.

First of

20

all, whatever -- and I think the District Court considered

21

this because he asked them something about the nature of that

22

challenge.

23

that is presented here, because they didn't know about it.

24

They did not make a knowing tactical decision based on all

25

the available information, because the information was hidden

Whatever it was they decided was not the claim

Heritage Reporting Corporation

15

1

from them.

2

In fact, the whole nature of this plan was to

3

deceive them into thinking that there was sufficient

4

representation of women and blacks, that this really wasn't

5

worth wasting the time on to try to raise a challenge like

6

this.

7

But secondly, I think, given the passage of time

8

and all the other factors that the District Court could

9

take into consideration, looking at the totality of the

10

circumstances, it did resolve this conflict in the testimony

11

by finding that they would have raised the claim.

12

would suggest that based upon all the points that I have gone

13

through, that finding is supported by the record.

14

And I

And again, I think the question under Rule 52(a),

15

is that a plausible reading of the record, are the District

16

Court's factfindings plausible, and I would submit that they

17

certainly are, and that they are not clearly erroneous, and

18

that the Eleventh Circuit, the key errors that .the Eleventh

19

Circuit made here was in rejecting the finding that it was

20

clearly erroneous -- excuse me, rejecting it without making

21

the finding that it was clearly erroneous, and of course since

22

it is supported by the record, it can't be done, and I would

23

point out as well that nowhere has the state in either the

24

Eleventh Circuit or before this Court argued that the

25

factfindings of the District Court are clearly erroneous.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

16

And I think besides the one which we have touched

1
2

upon or talked about, the tactical decision argument that the

3

state has made based upon that selective use of Mr. Pryor's

4

testimony, two other factfindings are critical, one, the

5

discriminatory purpose of the plan, which really had not been

6

contested until we qot to this Court, and then second the

7

concealment point, and I would like to just talk briefly about

8

each of those, if I may.

9

For the first time in this Court the state says

10

these are target figures, and at one point in their brief

11

they even say there is no evidence as to the author, the

12

purpose, or to whom this plan was submitted, and I just want

13

to make it clear the evidence is uncontradicted.

14

The clerk of the court, Mr. Dennis, testified that

15

he received the note from the district attorney to the jury

16

commissioners for the purpose of telling them how many blacks,

17

women, and young oeople were to be put on the master jury

18

lists.

19

knowledge to the chairman, and the testimony was that they

20

followed it.

21

He as secretary of the commission communicated this

And indeed in the District Court the state con­

22

ceded, and I quote, "intentional discrimination on the

23

uncontroverted evidence that was produced in Bailey versus

24

Vining," which was the case in which this scheme first came

25

to light, and of course the District Court findings in both
Heritage Reporting Corporation

17

1

the Bailey case and the District Court findings below in

2

this case are that it was a plan to bring about intentional

3

discrimination with the purpose of avoiding a prima facie

4

case to set the level of discrimination at just such a

5

place that it would insulate it from judicial review, and

6

therefore deny litigants the opportunity to challencre it and

7

be successful.

8

Really, the fundamental question, it seems, on

9

this case, is who put this case in the posture that it is in

10

today?

11

after the pretrial hearings and after the trial in state court?

12

And the answer to that has to be the district attorney in

13

this case.

14

Why is this claim brought to the District Court

There is a lot of argument about whether the

15

lawyers -- what they wanted to do or should have looked have

16

looked for a needle in a haystack over at the clerk's office,

17

but the fact of the matter is, the district attorney knew

18

exactly what had happened.

19

arraignment and said, I just want to put on the record I have

20

instructed the jury commission to underrepresent black

21

people and women in the master list, and once everyone

22

recovered from the shock, you would assume that the same thina

23

would have happened there that happened when this came out

24

in Bailey versus Vining before the District Court, and the

but the fact that somebody's not very good at hiding the

Obviously somebody in the clerk's

The only thing you can get is the list.

Secondly, there was no basis for them to know that

10

the district attorney in that case was not complying with

11

Georgia law, federal law, the United States Constitution,

12

the ethics of prosecutors, which say that he is to have no

13

role at all in telling the jury commission how to go about

14

its work, but certainly no role in telling them how to limit

the participation of cognizable groups on the jury.

So there was no reason for them to go to the clerk's

had no reason to know that it existed in the first place.

just the nature of the plan itself was such that obviously,

the Court, the existence of the memo which has been the

courts is only relevant in the context of this particular

case if the memorandum played some part in the strategy

throughout the entire proceeding was to attempt to avoid the

6

They didn't just blindly try to do this, though.

They went and investigated the actual traverse jury list to

Another consideration that they had, of course,

They never said that the motion for continuance deprived

they said in the continunace motion was, they wanted more

point is on the motion for change of venue is that the

The filing for the

So what they were essentially doing was hedging

their bets and seeing if the beneficial jury they believed

that they had had any fixed opinions, they'd still be able

to take them off based on a motion for change of venue

or exclusion on the peremptory challenges.

and found that the memorandum was readily discoverable, and

because it was discoverable the attorneys chose not to go and

You acknowledge that as far as the other points are concerned

16

the District Court's decision was not clearly erroneous,

Your Honor, in the first order of

miscarriage of justice to overlook the intentional act of

we say is clearly erroneous.

With resnect to the second order of the District

reasonable for Lambert and Pryor at the time they were

Of course, the reasons

reasons for not challenging it were, but we don't contest

which did not include the statement that if they had known

What they rely upon, Your Honor, what

they have always relied upon is JA60, where they ask Mr.

leading question, "Do you recall Mr. Lambert ever saying to

would have raised it." He says, "Yeah, I recall that.

was misconstrue his recollection as a specific recollection

MS. BOLEYN:

I think our bottom line position on

this, Your Honor, is that the memo has no relevance in this

case because it was not a basis for the trial attorneys'

deliberate decision, and this is borne out in the manner in

6

which they finally did raise their challenge.

7

Both Mr. Pryor and Mr. Lambert testified that they

8

raised the jury issue on direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme

9

Court solely because they said we had lost in Mr. Amadeo's

10

case and we wanted to raise every issue we could raise, and

11

of course at that time, you know, the trial was over and we

12

were reaching for straws and doing everything we could to

try to follow through, so they had had an unsuccessful trial

QUESTION:

11

MS. BOLEYN:

Because they -Because they at all times assumed

would be futile.

They never -- they never thought it

They never —

QUESTION:

And what did they base that assumption

on?

16

MS. BOLEYN:

They said general knowledge in the

17

legal community^ that it statistically wasn't right, and alsr

18

general knowledge that if you went far back enough in

19

Georgia that you were going to find an underrepresentation

20

of blacks in the grand and traverse juries.

21

QUESTION:

In other words, the statistics on

22

their face show about the same disproportion that were

23

shown in the memo?

statistics.

QUESTION:

-'ere those statistics easily

demonstrable other than from the memo?
MS. BOLEYN:

Yes, they were, Your Honor, because

9

that's how Mr. Coates got them, was going to the clerk's

10

office himself and doing the tabulations, and then he

11

presented those in Bailey v. Vining.

12

Our position is that there has never

13

been a sufficient showing of cause by the petitioner in this

14

case, that the attorneys made an intentional, deliberate

IS

strategical decision, albeit one that failed, to go with an

16

advantageous jury array and not to file what they believed

17

would be a successful challenge to the grand and traverse

18

juries which would only buy them delay and would not keep

19

the death penalty from being imposed upon the petitioner.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask you another question?

21

Supposing they made the strategic decision this was the best

22

jury they could get, and afterwards they found out that one

23

of them had been bribed to return a guilty verdict.

24

they didn't know it, but they made a strategic decision.

25

Would that be cause?

It could be, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Why would that be different, because

they thought they had a good jury.

5

MS. BOLEYN:

Because I think, Your Honor, first

6

of all you have to look at what they assume.

7

attorneys in your hypothetical assumed that they could

8

successfully challenge it without the bribe?

9

QUESTION:

10

MS. BOLEYN:

If the

Then that would be a reasonable

strategic decision, the fact that they didn't-- they thought

Would they be barred from raising that then?

16

MS. BOLEYN:

It depends on whether the reasonable­

17

ness, you know, whether there was ineffectiveness for not

18

knowing about the bribe or something like that.

19

QUESTION:

They just didn't look at the memo that

20

said, we bribed this juror that was hiding over, you know, was

in the clerk's office.

Yes, they assumed — they made all

those assumptions and decided, well,

That is what I thought I was

They say, yes, I figure pretty well one of these jurors is

2

bribed, but this looks like a pretty good jury to me, let's

3

go with it.

4

MS. BOLEYN:

And the key inquiry whether if they

5

think they need an element of proof that they don't have for

6

whatever they are trying to show, then there you would have

7

the nexus.

8

lack of knowing about the bribery, in this case the lack of

9

knowing about the challengeability of the jury and the

10

decision, but the key part comes in, of course, when you

11

assume that you have all the elements o f proof you needed,

12

and they assumed they would have the evidence of intentional

13

discrimination based on statistics if they looked at them.

There was just an assumption they had a general notion they

MS. BOLEYN:

No, Your Honor.

They said that if

you went back far enough in Georgia,

where there was not a prior jury challenge, you were going

to find underrepresentation of blacks on the jury,

The Eleventh Circuit did not reach prejudice, but

20

let me just state that we have never conceded that there was

sufficient prejudice under the cause and prejudice standard.

22

What we did concede is that the Bailey v. Vining order

established underrepresentation of blacks.

we could do about that, but whether or not that constitutes

Mr. Bright, you have two minutes remaining

OPAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT, ESQUIRE

6

Thank you, Ms. Boleyn.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

7

MR. BRIGHT:

Very well.

I would just point to

8

the record very quickly on the prejudice question.

9

said, the same attorney general, that prejudice has been

10

conceded by the state throughout the proceedings because of

11

the intentional discrimination and the uncontroverted evidence

12

in Bailey.

The state

13

The other point I want to make is just what has

14

been said repeatedly in both the briefs and the arauments,

15

that this is speculation and inference bv mvself or in our

16

brief or witnesses, these are findings of a United states

17

District Court.

18

it found at Page 79 of the Joint Appendix that it was done

19

for the purpose of avoiding a prima facie case.

The District Court found discrimination, and

20

This is not anybody's speculation.

21

findings that a District Court could make based upon all

22

the evidence, and I would just point out as well with recrard

23

to what the lawyers would have done that when Mr. Coates

24

testified at Page 47 of the record he talked about this was

25

a death penalty case, we had a hard case, and I wish we had

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

These were

59

1

known, because we were looking for every issue to raise,

2

when he testified, so it wasn't just the testimony of Fr.

3

Jerniaan.
QUESTION:

4

S

Can you tell us why the prosecutor

wasn't called as a witness?
MR. BRIGHT:

I think the evidence was established

Dennis, the clerk of the court and secretary to the jury

commission.

10

office, I communicated it, they followed it to the letter,

11

and the District Court made those findings.

Why the state

12

didn't call the prosecutor, I have no idea.

Of course, he

13

did have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege, but I don't know

14

if that's the reason.

He said, I got this from the District Attorney's

MR. BRIGHT:

QUESTION:

18

MR. BRIGHT:

19

20

Amadeo didn't need him.
Excuse me?
Amadeo didn't need the prosecutor.
We certainly did not need the

prosecutor in this particular case.
And finally, with regard to the motions, I want

21

to make clear there were three motions filed prior to trial.

22

Two more were filed on the day of trial, but there were three

23

filed prior, but with regard to that continuance motion, one

24

°f the reasons that it was ^iled was that, and the lawyers

25

didn't just file a motion.

They filed an affidavit, and they

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

60

1

swore to this statement that there was so much passion and

2

prejudice in the community that they needed to continue the

3

case to the next term of court so that the passions in that

4

particular jury could die down, and if they had cone to the

5

March term it would have been a new term of court.

6

For all these reasons, we would ask the Court to

7

reverse the Eleventh Circuit and reinstate the District

Court.
