ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. FRANKEL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may'it please

11

the Court, the Court's writ in this case to the second circuit

12

brings up for review questions relating to the scope and

13

meaning ofithe so-called Noerr, Pennington doctrine, a

14

doctrine which, as this Court knows, made clear that the

IS

Sherman Act is not applicable to combinations of businessmen

16

associated together for the purpose of attempting to influence

17

or for the purpose of seeking legislation beneficial to

18

themselves in association and unfavorable to their competitors.

19

That Noerr doctrine is based, as Your Honors know,

20

on a construction of what the Sherman Act read by itself was

21

meant to cover and not to cover, and on overtones of the first

22

amendment affecting the right of association and the right to

23

petition the government.

24

We are concerned in this case with the National
Electrical Code, the NEC, which I shall call it, which I am

It is adopted by most of the other states with
relatively modest amendments.

12

This controversy began when Carlon, as it has been

13

called, a subsidiary of the respondent, arid we have referred

14

to Carlon throughout the case rather than Indian Head, Carlon

15

undertook to have a new Article 331 added to this Code which

16

would have included as suitable equipment electric nonmetallic

17

19

buildings.

20

product included in this Code because, as we all agree,

21

without such inclusion it couldn'.t sell it in most of the

22

places throughout the United States where that Code is law.

23

There has been evidence throughout this case that

That tubincr is a kind of

unsafe, that it was hazardous to human life in the event of

2

fire, which is what that Code is, of course, ultimately

3

concerned with.

4

friend's brief suggests that that statement is misleading, I

5

should say that at Page 4A of the petitioner's appendix you

6

will find the circuit reflecting the concurrent findings of

7

both lower courts that there was scientific evidence of the

8

hazardousness of this product at the material times in this

9

case.

10

I might mention that since a footnote in our

Nov/, the way you get something into this Code is

11

by a multisteo process that the circuit described.

12

the proposed article goes before a so-called Code-making

13

panel.

step, a membership meeting of the members of the NFpA, the

15

Fire Protection Association.

First,

Whatever happens there is reviewable at a second

16

If there is a result which the party adversely

17

affected wishes to complain there is an appeal to a Standards

18

Council and to the Board of Directors, and then if there has

19

been a rejection of a proposed article, there is a procedure

20

for seeking a tentative interim amendment which would put the

21

proposed article into the Code.

22

Now, this whole case centers on the second step,

23

the membership vote, which took place in this case on May

24

20, 1980.

25

their product, then changed its decision and aoproved it

The Code-making panel had at first rejected ENMT,

and most members are interested, as part of the process that

9

the NFPA describes and extols, and I quote, "have the

10

11

them how to vote."

12

Now, Allied within that rule as part of the effort

13

of itself and other companies in competition with this poly­

14

vinyl product collected 155 members for that May 20 meeting,

15

and those members included executives of the company,

16

employees, sales agents, and even the wife of a sales

17

director.

18
19

Other steel companies also gathered whatever members
they could, so that among them these alleged conspirators had

QUESTION:

5

6

Mr. Frankel, the case was submitted to

the jury on interrogatories?
MR. FRANKEL:

7

Yes, Your Honor, and the answers to

8

those interrogatories will be found at Pages 23, 4, and 5

9

of this slender joint appendix.

10

Carlon took its appeal to the Standards Council and

11

to the Board of Directors, where it was defeated on those

12

appeals and the record shows there is plenary authority to

13

consider whatever the appellant wishes to present, including

14

even new evidence, and then Carlon soucrht as the last steo

15

in this process a tentative interim amendment.

16

defeated at every stage, and the most interesting in some

17

respects was the last stage, because in the denial of the

18

tentative interim amendment, the TIA, the directors made

19

clear that one of the serious considerations leading to that

20

denial at that time was their still unresolved doubts about

21

safety.

22

Thereafter, as the briefs show,

It was

and nobody

23

disagrees on this, in 19,84 Carlon's product was allowed into

24

the Code but with a limitation to three-story buildings, again

25

reflecting three years later the still lingering concerns

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628*4888

7

1

about safety in the event of fire.

2

October, 1981, Carlon, as a result of that rejection of its

3

article, brought'this lawsuit against Allied and the NFPA,

4

later dropped the NFPA, pursued the case against Carlon.

5

The gist of the lawsuit as we think is perfectly clear is

6

stated in the language of the complaint quoted at Paaes 13

7

and 14 of the joint appendix that this suit was brought, and

8

I quote, "because of the adoption and application of the NEC

9

by states and municipalities," and I end the quote there,

10

without their Article 331, and they say, because of that

11

adoption of that Code without 331 by all these states and

12

municipalities, they lost a tremendous lot of sales,which is

13

not disputed.

14

However, going back to

Our client asserted the Noerr, Pennington doctrine

15

as a defense, and I will try to abbreviate.

16

trial judge reserved on that, let the case go to the jury.

17

There was a verdict for Carlon including the quaint finding

18

by the jury that Allied, our client, had subverted the

19

process.

20

the trial -- I should have said it was a bifurcated trial,

21

liability first, then damaqes — there was a verdict for

22

Heritage Reporting Corporation

8

1

and held that Noerr, Pennington does not apply, and that is

2

what brings us here.

3

the time it got to this legal aspect of the case lost sicrht

4

of the facts it had so carefully stated and utterly, with all

5

deference, utterly misconceived what Noerr, Pennington -- what

6

the Noerr decision itself was about, what its facts were, and

7

what it held.

8

We think that the Court of Appeals by

The Court will recall that the Noerr decision, which

9

had its 27th anniversary last Saturday, related to what the

10

Court, all three courts describe as a vicious, corrupt, and

11

fraudulent publiclity campaign addressed to the general public

12

by a railroad association in an effort to poison public

13

opinion against the trucking industry and thereby as the

14

hoped for next step to achieve legislation hostile to truckers.

15

The Court said that the campaign by the railroads

16

included conduct that Justice Black described for a unanimous

17

bench as reprehensible.

18

of representing opinions and expressions coming actually

19

from the railroads were the emanations of citizens and civic

20

associations.

MR. FRANKEL:

No, I think strictly, Justice O'Connor,

Noerr rests on a construction of the Sherman strictly, that

3

whatever else you might say about that reprehensible conduct,

4

it was not conduct at which the Sherman Act was aimed.

5

was not —

6

QUESTION:

It

Well, is that interpretation of the Sher­

7

man Act required because of some constitutional provision, do

8

you suppose?

9

MR. FRANKEL:

Well, I would say, to try my best

10

to report Justicue Black's opinion accurately, that after

11

savinq that this is not Sherman Act conduct, he went on to

12

say in that many words that if we were to rule otherwise,

13

we would run into serious concerns under the First Amendment

14

because we would be cutting into or we might be cutting into

15

the right of association and the riaht through association to

16

petition the government.

17

But I think scholars have agreed, and I think it

18

is fair to say htat it was only two cases later in the

19

California Trucking Case that this Court came down and

20

explicitly said that one leg of the NoerrPennington

21

doctrine is indeed the First Amendment.

22

I have concentrated on the Court's principle as I

23

understand them initially on the Sherman Act, because I think

24

Noerr did concentrate that way, and what Justice Black said

25

is, whatever else you say about this conduct, which, by the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10

1

way, is illegal conduct, as the Third Circuit had held,

2

whatever else you say about it, this isn't what the Sherman

3

Act was about.

It is not a case of people giving up their

4

trade freedom.

It is not a case of price fixing or boycotts

5

or market divisions or any other kind of market behavior about

6

which Senator Sherman and his friends were thinking.

7

It is an attempt to influence public opinion with

8

the goal of getting legislation, and that is not Sherman Act

9

conduct even before you reach the First Amendment, and then,

10

of course, the Justice and this Court unanimously did reach

11

the First Amendment.

12

Now, in the opinion for the Second Circuit of Judge

13

Lumbar, they ran a series of distinctions of Noerr, and again

14

with great respect it is our submission that every one of

15

them is clearly wrong.

16

holding, in the lanauage of the circuit, depended upon the

17

unique nature of petitions directed to the crovernment in our

18

political system.

19

They say, first, that Noerr's

Well, that is a mistake. There were no petitions

20

directed to the government at all in the Noerr case.

21

Noerr case, as Justice Black wrote over and over again, was

22

about this campagin of publicity addressed to the general

23

public with the hope or anticipation that the public in turn

24

would have an impact on the legislature.

25

Now, that was indirect.

And Judge Lumbard writes

11

that our conduct is somehow distinguishable because it is
indirect.

Well, we say it is not distincruishable at all.
QUESTION:

insofar as Members of Congress are also members of the public.
MR. FRANKEL:

In that sense, Justice O'Connor, it

is direct, but I don't think there is a word in the Noerr
opinion that describes directness in any such sense.

The

opinion is about this broad effort, vicious and corrupt, to
poison the public mind, and to be sure, that includes members
of legislatures.
But then when you speak of directness and indirect­
ness, let's compare the cases.

QUESTION:

because of Noerr, Pennington the defendants here could act

since then that though we would not use such characterizations,
the defendants could have acted viciously and reorehensibly
and perhaps, though I don't want to press this, illegally as
long as what they were doing was attempting to influence
legislation.
The solicitor General says some place that of course
the Noerr doctrine would not cover kidnapoing legislators.
I think that takes us away from our subject, because I don't
think everybody has thought until now that the Sherman Act
related to kidnapping legislators, but where the conduct is
arguably Sherman Act, and Justice Black said this kind of
attempt to influence the legislature is not, the fact that it
turns out to be such an attempt because

23

25

of what are found in

the end to be the real meanings of the Sherman Act in the
light of the First Amendment preclude Sherman Act liability.

Yes, Your Honor.

I might say there's a Seventh Circuit case cited
in our brief which involved actual bribery of city council
members.

It's the MetroCable case in 1975.

And there again,

going much farther than we have to go in this case, the Court
read Noerr to applv.

Judge Lombard said that there is a distinction that

as the Noerr analysis of the problem was concerned.

was only the antecedent conduct.

I believe it may be the first footnote, you will find him

2

saying that this is the most widely adopted Code, and if I

3

just find his first footnote rather than mine I might be

4

able to read to Your Honor, and he cites specifics from an

5

affidavit on our behalf, that is, that 26 states adopted

6

verbatim, 19vadopted with amendments, and if you pursue that

7

it appears that maybe ten or eleven of the 114 articles in this

8

Code tend to be amended, and the municipalities, which are

9

very important in this regard, also widely adopt it, and it

10

says here, and I think the survey was of municipalities of

only eleven articles, but compare -■

QUESTION:

Mr. Frankel, could you clarify that?

16

incorporation by reference, is that a process which is what

17

you might call year by year incorporation?

18

say that this Code as amended from year to year shall be the

19

governing Code, or does the legislature each year pass a

20

separate statute?

MR. FRANKEL:

I would in ignorance settle for its

not being automatic and for the legislators lookincr at it

4

every three years and looking at these 700 pages and deciding

5

that they can do no better or other than adopt this Code as

6

it is written.

7

I want to touch on one final point of Judge Lombard's

8

He said you wouldn't know where to cut this off if you made

9

this process subject to Noerr, because you wouldn't know how

10

many legislatures had to adopt it before Noerr applied.

11

I want to say of

12

a result that comprised only one legislative veto in

If results count, and we don't think they do, because

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDRIC W. YERMAN, ESO.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. YERMAN:

Mr. Chief Juistice, and may it Please

5

the Court, let me begin by turning directly to Noerr.

6

have all heard, Justice Black focused in that case on what

7

he described as the right of the people to inform their

8

representatives in government of their desires with respect to

9

the passage or enforcement of law.

10

Court held that the railroad publicity campaign in that case,

11

despite being deceiptful and underhanded, did not violate the

12

antitrust laws because, in the words of Noerr, a publicity

13

campaign to influence governmental action falls clearly within

14

the category of political activity to which the Sherman Act

15

does not apply.

As we

In other words, in all of those

jurisdictions where Carlon could otherwise have sold its
product notwithstanding any state action, Carlon suffered
independent marketplace injury.

The record is abundantly clear

that the trial court charged the jury that that was what the
evidence was limited to, and if we want, a little bit later
I will get to that specific evidence.
Now, Allied argues that what it did so long as its
actions were ultimately in pursuit of legislation is somehow
sheltered by Noerr.

In effect, Allied seeks to duck under the

Noerr umbrella by claiming that its conduct, an anti-trust
violation committed within the National Fire Protection
Association which standing alone caused injury to Carlon

In Hydrolevel the Code,

according to this Court, was adopted in whole by 46 states.

2

In fact, this Court made a ooint of saying the thing that made

that anti-trust violation in Hydrolevel so terrible, so

pernicious was because of the governmental adoption, the impor­

tance and influence of the Code.

6

What this all comes down to is that the hold that

Noerr applies here would be to conclude that the Congress

that enacted the Sherman Act, because I agree with Mr.

9

Frankel that in fact Noerr itself -- Justice Black was

10

initially grounding it on a matter of statutory interpreta­

12

Sherman introduced the Sherman Act he intended to insulate

13

from all anti-trust scrutiny all concerted activity in a

private standard-making context in effect to license the

blatant anticompetitive conspiracy found in this case, and I

submit that that simply defies logic and reason, especially

So does stacking meetings.

If it

That's the root of the issue.

Okay.

First of all, within the rules, Allied conceded in its

20

brief in the Court of Appeals below that what we had here was

21

a potential for abuse. That is how they described the rule

situation of the NFPA.

23

The NFPA had rules that allowed someone, unfortunate

ly in this case, to circumvent their procedures and to sub­

Now,

How does that constitute an anti-trust

private organizations, but we are talking here about an

that make this an unreasonable restraint of trade?

And I

8

apologize for the ambiguity, Justice White, but I really think

9

that is what the issue is.

10

On the issue of the inconsistency of the verdicts

11

in talking about no violation of rules and so forth, the jury

12

and the trial court had no problem understanding based upon

13

the evidence here why even though there were these rules under

14

all of the evidence put in concerning how the NFPA operated,

15

what the NFPA's overall policies, standards, and what every­

16

body in that organization understood its objectives and

17

standards to be, that this was in fact a corruption of the

18

process, that this was in fact the achievement of a consensus

19

other than the consensus that would have been achieved.

20

the plaintiff argued below that the verdicts were inconsistent

21

something not before you today, the judce held that it is not

22

inconsistent, the fact that there was a finding of subversion

even though there was a finding that the rules weren't

He said, that is not consistent.

the jury found that, but I told the jury they were entitled to

subverted the spirit of the rules as well as their letter,

so that finding is

7

is precisely the answer we contemplated when we put it to the

jury, and he goes on that way, to point out that he found

9

there was nothing inconsistent, and I would point out, of

10

course, that at this level it is hardly the time to start

11

looking into inconsistencies, especially where the rule is

12

very clear that if the verdicts can be read in any way to be

13

consistent, then the verdict is to be sustained, and I think

the trial court and the court of appeals both have reviewed

that issue, and both have found the jury's verdicts were

You can lobby.

You can talk to all the people who would otherwise

be coming.

You can try to make sure there is an important

discussion of this.

But you shouldn't change what the vote

otherwise would have been.
QUESTION:

How do you know whether you are changing

what the vote would otherwise have been?
MR. YERMAN:

You know it when you bring in 220

people, you pay their expenses, they are know-nothing voters,
they don't know what they are voting on, they are not par­
ticipating in the debate, they have nothing to

say about

anything other than they were trucked up to Boston to vote no
on the product.

Nothing like that has ever happened before,

Sessions, all the people that were voters were

government officials, and there was no injury other than
injury from the state, and both of those are very important
distinctions from us in Sessions.

I am not rearguing

Sessions, but what the Sessions court said was, we think,
and they analyzed this out to say Noerr should apply, but
they said, nevertheless, lookinq at the Second Circuit, we
disagree with their Noerr reasoning, but clearly what
happened in the Second Circuit would be a sham.
