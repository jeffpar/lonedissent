ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE:

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10

it please the Court, these cases, which were consolidated in

11

the District Court, present questions concerning the denial, on

12

foreign policy grounds, of non-immigrant visas to aliens

3

invited by persons or groups in this country to participate in

4

public or academic discussions.
The denials were based on a provision that appears on

15

6

page 2 of our brief, Subsection 27, of a list of provisions in

7

Section

8

excluding aliens from the issuances of visas.

9

instance, they were denied as prejudicial to the public

82 of Title VIII, which are provisions or bases for
And, in this

20

interest or endangering the welfare, safety, or security of the

21

United States.

22

The Court of Appeals held, and it is not contested in

23

this Court, that foreign policy concerns can be a proper basis

24

for a denial under Subsection 27; that something detrimental to

25

our foreign policy interests would be within the broad

formulation of prejudicial to the public interest or

2

3

And the statutory issues that remain in the case, are

4

whether that denial can be based on detriment to our foreign

5

policy that flows from the very presence or entry of the alien

6

into this country?

something detrimental about the particular activities in which

MR. WALLACE:

I would not characterize my

burden that way, Mr. Justice.

19

Obviously --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WALLACE:

Well, what does it mean, do you think?
Well, there are two ways of looking at

22

it, that support our position.

23

commonly used in this litigation is to say that presence or

24

entry into the United States are, themselves, activities.

25

is a little difficult to reconcile with the words,

Heritage

The one that has been more

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That

"to engage",

1

in activities, but it is not beyond the pale, in light of the

2

legislative history.

3

Another way, which I think may be more helpful, is to

4

say that, yes, they are admitted to engage in activities.

5

that those activities, while not detrimental to the public

6

interest if engaged in by somebody else, would be detrimental

7

to the public interest, if engaged in by this individual,

8

because it would involve his presence or entry into the United

9

States, to engage in those activities.

10

QUESTION:

And

Well, in this case, as I understand it,

11

there is no evidence, whatever, that they had any intention of

12

engaging in any activities.

13

on the fact that they are members of what, the Communist Party?

14

MR. WALLACE:

This rests, does it not, entirely

Yes.

16

the Federation of Cuban Women; and in the third instance, a

17

group called the World Peace Council, which was found to be --

18

QUESTION:

And by reason of their association of one

19

or the other or more of those organizations, that they were

20

said to be excludable under the Statute?

21

MR. WALLACE:

It was by reason of that, coupled with

22

the State Department's determination that these organizations

23

are instruments of a particular foreign government; and that it

24

would be disadvantageous to our conduct of foreign policy, to

25

admit someone for the purpose of carrying on that

11

Well, it --

That is correct.

That is a different theory than the

dissent below, I think.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the dissent authorizes in its

16

theory, a broader use of Subsection 27, then we are actually

17

making of it.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

So you are not espousing the theory of the

dissent?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am not disassociating myself

21

from it, but we do not have to go as far as some of the

22

implications of the dissenting opinion.

23

QUESTION:

Well, you are not arguing that mere

24

presence and mere entry is an activity, within the meaning of

25

Subsection 27?

Or are you?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is one of our alternative

2

contentions, yes.

3

entry or mere presence is an activity, that within itself,

4

detrimental to our foreign policy interests.

We have the authority to decide that mere
is

But in administering the statute, the fact of the

5

6

matter is, we look at the activities in which they propose to

7

engage, before making the determination of whether entry or

8

presence would be detrimental to our foreign policy.
But we do so in a very limited way.

9
10

In other words,

we allow individuals to enter, even though we might deny them
entry for this purpose, but we would allow them to enter and we

2

have allowed some of these same individuals to enter --

3

including Olga Finlay -- to attend meetings of an international

4

body, such as the United Nations.

We would allow them to enter for limited purposes.
We would allow them to --

reason for their exclusion?

detrimental, or is it, that the activities in which they would

_6

engage would be detrimental?

_7

What is the finding?

_8

MR. WALLACE:

I cannot say that the District Judge's

_9

finding is articulated so as to draw that distinction, as I

10

recall it.

11

It would be a --

12

QUESTION:

11

MR. WALLACE:

It would make a difference in this.
I am looking at Page 80-A of the Joint

14

Appendix, where the District Court merely says, it has

11

concluded that,

11
12

visas to the four individuals, whose entry is being sought in

11

"Facially legitimate reasons exist for denying

these actions."
"And they were not denied entry because of the

11

content of the expected speeches, but because of their personal

20

status as officials of governments or organizations which are

2i

hostile to the United States."

22

But the affidavits, on which he relies, do state, as

23

part of the reasons why their entry would be detrimental to our

24

foreign policy interests, is because it is entry to function as

11

representatives of -- in Mr. Borge's case,

Cuban governments; and in Mr. Pasti's case, to further the

3

program of an organization controlled by the Soviet Union.
That is necessarily related to the kinds of

activities that they propose to engage in.

But the distinction

that we make, with respect to activities,

United States; to conduct bi-lateral discussions with

14

representatives of the United States; humanitarian e"+-ry, such

15

as to get medical treatment; to attend a family funeral.
We would allow people in for those purposes, but not

extend our general hospitality to them of providing them with a

non-immigrant visa, because, as the affidavits explain,

Mr. Wallace, the thing that troubles me is

21

that you are telling me what the affidavits say, but the

22

finding just relates to the personal status of the three

23

people.

24

that they were not denied because of the content of their

25

expected speeches, but because of their personal status, as

I would think that it would apply going to a funeral,

I would think that would apply if they wanted to come
in and have lunch.

MR. WALLACE:

But the finding was made based on

affidavits that explain the reasons --

7

QUESTION:

Well, let me just ask you,

is it necessary

8

for us to support your position to go behind the finding, and

9

rely on what is in the affidavits,

10

instead of what the finding

says ?

11

MR. WALLACE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WALLACE:

I think that --

That is your whole argument,

is it not?

I would say that it is necessary to

14

read the finding in light of the affidavits on which the

15

finding is based, because the finding is very succinctly

16

stated.

17

in Kleindienst v. Mandel, that the Courts are not to go behind

18

facially legitimate reasons that have been given.

19

The finding is very responsive to this Court's holding

And he is relying on the affidavits as the facially

20

legitimate reasons, and in a sense, the finding incorporates

21

the affidavits,

22

District Court's decision can be read without reference to the

23

affidavits.

if I may say so.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WALLACE:

I do not think that the

We have the affidavits.

They are in the Joint Appendix, and the

Reporting Corporation

1

classified ones that he refers to, are in the Appendix to the

2

Petition for Certiorari because they were declassified and

3

reprinted there.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, when you speak about a

5

finding in this case, actually the District Court granted

6

summary judgment for the Government, did it not?

7

MR. WALLACE:

8

QUESTION:

9

That is correct.

So you are not talking about finding,

in

the ordinary sense, of a finding of fact at a bench trial?
MR. WALLACE:

10

That is correct.

It granted summary

11

judgment.

13

reasons given by the Government in this series of affidavits,

14

for the exclusion.

15

It concluded that there were no material issues of

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask whether you agree

16

with the dissent in the Court below, that Kleindienst v.

17

Mandel, necessarily upheld the constitutionality of the

18

exclusion of communists based on their political beliefs?

19

20

Was that, do you agree that that was the necessary
holding of Mandel?

21

MR. WALLACE:

I do not read Kleindienst v. Mandel as

22

necessarily holding that.

23

legitimate reason for that particular exclusion, because

24

Professor Mandel had violated restrictions on his visa, in past

25

entries.

Heritage

It said that there was a facially

12
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

And that that was a sufficient basis to uphold the

2

visa, here, and to override any First Amendment claim that was

3

implicated on behalf of those who invited him.

4

say that we can read Kleindienst v. Mandel as having resolved

5

that question so definitively, with respect, I have to say that

6

is slightly overstated in that dissenting opinion.

So, I cannot

7

The reasons given in these affidavits do relate to

8

specific foreign policy concerns and we have summarized them

9

briefly, in our brief.

Let me say that with respect to those

10

who would be entering here, as representatives of an

11

organization and to further the purposes of an organization,

12

controlled by the Cuban government, the reference was to our

13

country's policy of trying to diminish the disruptive influence

14

of the Cuban government in Latin America, that is detrimental

15

to the conduct of our foreign policy.

16

hospitality to representatives of that government for purposes

17

of participating in discussions in the United States, would

18

contribute to giving that government an aura of legitimacy,

19

that would enhance that government's ability to undermine our

20

foreign policy objectives, in Central America.

21

QUESTION:

And that extending

But do you need our Courts for that

22

purpose -- to enforce public policy in foreign governments and

23

to prevent foreign governments?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

We did not need the Court and we were

not the one who invoked the Court's jurisdiction.

13

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

We were sued

1

2

in this case, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

We simply denied visas.

You want us to say that the Court can

3

approve the denial of an entry of somebody who is going to make

4

a speech, because the State Department does not like the

5

country or the person.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Because the State Department thinks

7

that it is detrimental, has concluded that it would be

0

detrimental to our foreign policy to extend our hospitality to

9

that person, with a non-immigrant visa.

10
11

And that that was

within the authority of the Department of State to do.
With respect to the Interior Minister of Nicaragua,

12

rather similar reasons were given, having to do with the

13

undermining of our efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of

14

hostilities in Central America, should we, at the time, extend

15

our hospitality to the Interior Minister, of that state, to

16

which we were, to some extent, in an adversarial relationship.

17

With respect to Mr. Pasti, an active member of the

18

World Peace Council, which the State Department had determined

19

to be a Soviet-controlled organization, at the time, he was

20

coming, that organization was engaged in a vigorous campaign to

21

undermine support within Western Europe for the deployment of

22

American missiles -- partly through a campaign of

23

disinformation, that is elaborated upon in an Attachment to one

24

of Undersecretary Eagleburger's affidavits.

25

And he was an active member, coming to further the

2

contribute to its esprit for that purpose.

But these determinations

have to be made in the context of the times,

in which they

for the possibility of some

I think some further insight into the problems of
this case, can be had by looking at the statistics that we

collected on page 6 of our brief,

also based on affidavit in this record.

25

This,

in itself,

Heritage

is reflective of the consistent

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

dominant thrust of our foreign policy, which is to encourage in

2

all countries -- including our own because reciprocity is a

3

very important consideration in foreign policy -- to encourage

4

freedom of travel, through non-immigrant visas, and indeed,

5

even to encourage freedom of immigration.

6

not only reflects our ideals about free interchange of persons

7

and ideas, but it is further supported from the likelihood of

8

re-examination by the very practical consideration that, in our

9

country, there is already a much greater diversity of views

And it would not be to our ultimate advantage,

12

overall, to be opposing travel by persons who might express

13

diverse views, because we tend to benefit much more from

14

additional views being expressed in other countries through

15

travel, than that it would be at all practical to hope to

monitor the expression of views in our country.

I think that you referred to?

17

MR. WALLACE:

18

QUESTION:

Certainly.

That was back in 1959, and is it not true

19

that a few years later, they amended the statute to provide a

20

new section that covered the people of that status?

21

MR. WALLACE:

People who were associated with the

22

Nazi Regime, during the thirties and World War II, but it does

23

not cover people who engaged in brutality while in office,

24

other countries at other times, and there are many such people.

correctly interpreting 27, and you gave us an example, this
Skorzeny, why did they need to enact 33?

They could have used

27?
MR. WALLACE:

Perhaps it was done for emphasis.

They

did not necessarily mean that Congress thought that 27 was
misapplied with respect to Mr. Skorzeny, and we have taken the
position right along, that we can apply it with respect to
others who have engaged in physical brutality, which are not
embraced while in office, which were not embraced within
Subsection 33.
There have been deposed governments in many countries
I do not want to create international incidents by
mentioning some of them — where we might very well deny, on
foreign policy grounds, the entry of these persons. And this
has not been disputed by the other side, nor do they deny our
basic proposition that it is not necessary for the activities
to be, in themselves, misconduct, because they point to the
case of a Libyan, young person denied entry to study aircraft
maintenance and engineering, as a proper example of the use of
Subsection 27.

In a case like that, where you are dealing with a

non-prominent person, the particular nature of the activities

looms as a larger consideration.
But in the case of prominent people, such as are

involved in our case, what really looms large on the foreign

policy call, is whether extending our hospitality to them, at

all, is going to be detrimental to our foreign policy?
Let me say that once it is concluded, as we submit,

8

9

that Subsection 27 authorizes us to exclude persons on these

10

grounds, it seems clear to us, that the McGovern Amendment is

11

not meant to take that away.
It says, on its face, that it applies only to persons

12

13

otherwise admissible to the United States. And the legislative

14

history we have recounted, particularly in connection with an

Amendment to the McGovern Amendment, shows that it has always

16

been understood not to diminish the authority that we had under

Subsection 27, specifically, the Chairman of the House Foreign

7

I think that it is obvious from the Government's

-- whether and to what extent,

As the Government points out and I just want to

8

reiterate, because I think that it is important to an analysis

9

of the case, there are two separate but related statutory

10

questions before the Court today.
One is, whether (a)(27) Section 2 2(a)(27), applies

2

in the absence of any allegation by the government that the

3

excluded foreign speaker is likely to engage in prejudicial

4

activities,

5

if admitted to the United States?

The second question, which the government barely

reached in its argument,

circumvent the Congressional restrictions embodied in the

8

McGovern Amendment, by using an alien's organizational

9

membership as the basis for exclusion under (a)(27)?

Wallace's argument, today, which apparently abandons the

4

the alien's mere entry or presence in the United States would

5

be prejudicial to the public interest.
That argument, as the Court of Appeals found, as the

6

•

7

government now apparently concedes, is simply impossible to

8

square with either the language or the history of (a)(27).

9

Indeed, the extent to which the government has, at

10

least until today, construed its authority under (a)(27), is

11

illustrated by the example of Nino Pasti.

12

NATO General, a former Italian Senator, and he worked in the

13

Pentagon for three years as a liaison between the Italian Armed

14

Services and the United States Armed Services.

In 1983, he was

invited to address a disarmament rally on Boston Commons by an
16

American peace group and he was denied the visa on the grounds

17

that the government feared that he would spread disinformation,

18

if permitted to enter the United States, and give his views on

19

the propriety of American missiles in Europe.
The statute that we are dealing with, (a)(27), quite

What I now understand the government to be saying is,

that a claim of mere entry or presence is not sufficient under

never authorized or contemplated by Congress when they adopted

believe, there are other provisions of the Immigration and

Nationality Act, including Section 212(f) of the Immigration

and Nationality Act, which may well permit the government under

certain circumstances to exclude somebody because their mere

interests.

7

But those other Sections of the Act are hinged in by

8

other procedural protections that Congress has provided, namely

9

in the case of 212(f), the requirement of a Presidential

10

finding to make sure that our government is not excluding

their speeches in the United States are likely to create

problems for American foreign policy interests.

I think that the government, in the

With regard to Pasti,

1

if you look at the affidavits

2

concerning Pasti, either the public or classified affidavits,

3

it is perfectly clear that the government's allegation,

4

case, was that his presence in the United States would create

5

problems because they did not like what they expected him to

6

say on the Boston Commons about American Pershing Missiles in

7

Europe and he was a person who came to that setting with great

8

credibility, because he was formerly the Chief Nuclear

9

Strategist for NATO.

in that

And they would prefer not to have him in this

10
11

country, at that time, delivering that message, because it made

12

it more complicated for them to put their missiles in Europe.
I do not think that there is any indication that

13

(a)(27) permits a visa denial on those grounds.
And in terms of the entry or presence, versus

10

that 60 or 70 million other people may have properly been

allegations connected to him, are connected to him personally.
The allegations connected to Pasti and to Finlay and
to Lezcano, are connected to them because of the organizations
to which they belong, and that is, we think, forbidden by the
McGovern Amendment, regardless of how you decide the other
(a)(27) question about entry or presence.
And let me come back to the entry or presence issue
for one more moment, then, just debunk this reliance on
legislative history.
The government makes a passing nod to the doctrine of
plain language that any analysis of the statute has to begin
with the language which the Congress has drafted, and it then,
for very understandable reasons, wants to get off that language
as quickly as possible, because, it, in fact, speaks to
activities and not entries or presence.
And where it winds up is in the legislative history.
And the government's position with regard to the legislative
history and it was a position that was echoed by Judge Bork, in
dissent, below, is that over the 40 or 50 years that this

Heritage

36
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

statute has been developing, there are five or six references

2

in committee reports, to the words, entry or presence, and

3

therefore, that supports the claim that when Congress referred

4

to activities,

it really meant to include entry and presence

6

As we point out, in our brief, if you in fact,

look

7

at the full passages cited by the government and not the

8

isolated phrases that I believe the government takes

9

context, you will see that every reference to entry or presence

out of

10

is followed by a reference in the next clause, or the next

11

sentence, to prejudicial activities within the United States.

12

And that, on the basis of a full and fair reading of

13

the legislative history, it seems quite clear, that what

14

Congress has been consistently concerned about,

15

its predecessor statutes, was entry and presence to engage in

16

prejudicial activities. And (27),

It is a very big leap to go from there to the

included speech making.
And when you look at the statements that Senator

2
3

McCarren made on the floor of the Congress when he introduced

4

the predecessor provision in 1950 -- in 1952, when Section

5

212(a)(27) was enacted, there was very little colloquy or

6

conference language about the provision.
And there was more in 1950 when its predecessor's

7
8

provision, the Internal Security Act was adopted and what

9

Senator McCarren, quite clearly says, and we cite it in our

10

brief,

is that his concern, the concern of Congress, was with

11

aliens who seek to enter or engage after entry, in activities

12

prejudicial to the public interest, and he, in fact, referred

13

to the requirement of overt acts.
And as I have said, previously, this record is

14
15

totally barren of any allegations that even comes close to

16

that.

Let me raise just a few other points with you.

The other thing that I want to bring to the Court's

attention, and I say this with regret, but it does not appear

10

12

(a)(27), which disappeared in 1954.

the First Amendment issue in Mandel.

Nothing in the holding of Mandel, I do not believe,

even remotely suggests that if the government keeps somebody

have to necessarily at least be part of the process, of

interpreting the statute to conform, not only with

believe, is the clear and obvious intent of Congress, as

MR. WALLACE:

The Court of Appeals referred to the

legislative history of Subsection 27 as interchangeably using

10

references to entry and activities as the basis of concern, and

11

that is, entirely consistent with Judge Harold Green's saying

12

that it is a distinction without a difference in this context.

13

And, that, as I tried to relate it to the text, that

16

17

is the

That is the thing that can be prejudicial rather than

18

anything that is malum and say, about the activities that is

19

our reading of our Subsection 27 and the way to reconcile it

20

with the repeated entries, repeated reference to entry or

21

presence in the legislative history of that provision and its

22

predecessors.

23

The affidavits,

in this case, and I refer the Court

24

to Joint Appendix pages 59, 62, and 89, repeatedly say that no

25

one is excluded from this country solely because his views are
