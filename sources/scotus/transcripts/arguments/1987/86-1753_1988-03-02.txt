CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument first

4

this morning in Number 86-1753, John Doe against the United

5

States.

6

Mr. Timbie, you may begin whenever you wish.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. TIMBIE, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TIMBIE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case involves the Fifth Amendment implications

11
12

of a court order requiring a Grand Jury target to waive foreign

13

bank secrecy requirements.

14

The facts can be stated simply.

John Doe is under

15

Grand Jury investigation for tax offenses. The Grand Jury knows

16

that Doe has bank accounts in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda

17

and believes that the records of those accounts would provide

18

evidence sufficient to bring an indictment.

19

The Grand Jury has tried to get those records by

20

serving subpoenas on the U.S. branches of those foreign banks,

21

but has been unsuccessful because the banks have objected on

22

the ground of foreign bank secrecy laws that prohibit

23

disclosure of bank information without the consent of the

24

customer.

25

The United States Attorney, therefore,
3

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

filed this

1

action in the District Court.

2

QUESTION:

3

States authorities?

4

MR. TIMBIE:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TIMBIE:

Excuse me. Is that binding on the United

The —
The foreign bank secrecy laws?
No, Your Honor, it's not binding, and,

7

in fact, it may not even be pertinent, but the Government feels

8

that it would be helpful in obtaining the records in a show

9

cause proceeding against the banks in the United States.

10

QUESTION:

But you could seek to compel the banks to

11

do it despite those foreign laws and take some action against

12

the domestic subsidiaries of the bank?

13

MR. TIMBIE:

Yes, Justice Scalia. That is precisely

14

what was done in the Bank of Nova Scotia case, and it is what

15

the Government acknowledges in a footnote in its brief.

16

proposes to do in this case.

17

sort of thumb on the scale in that balancing test that will be

18

used in that proceeding.

19

It

It simply wants this consent as a

The District Court originally denied the Government's

20

motion for an order requiring John Doe to sign the consent

21

directive, and the U.S. Attorney appealed the denial to the

22

Fifth Circuit which reversed and remanded.

23

On remand, Doe was ordered to sign the document and

24

refused to do so, was held in civil contempt, and sanctions

25

were stayed pending this appeal.

’

The directive that Doe has been ordered to sign by

2

the court below makes four statements.

3

directs any bank to disclose records of accounts over which he

4

has signatory authority.

5

right of withdrawal.

6

It says that Doe

Excuse me. Over which he has the

That that direction is irrevocable.

That that

7

direction is given pursuant to a court order, and that that

8

direction is intended to constitute consent for purposes of

9

Bermuda and Cayman law.

10

We contend that that order below violates Doe's Fifth

11

Amendment rights because the consent directive, once signed,

12

would be a compelled communication and its contents would be

13

used to incriminate Doe.

14

Now, the Government concedes compulsion and

15

incrimination, and we feel there is no serious doubt that what

16

we are dealing with here is a communication.

17

signed, the document will be a statement by Doe to the banks

18

that he directs them to disclose records, that he won't revoke

19

his direction, and that he will not later argue that it's not a

20

valid consent.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TIMBIE:

After all, once

But what's the testimonial about that?
Mr. Chief Justice, our contention is

23

that the Fifth Amendment test is not whether the statement is

24

testimonial in the narrow sense that the Government argues;

25

that is, that it gives the Government information that is
5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

directly relevant to the case or could be used as leads; but

2

the test that this Court has used in every case and that is the

3

rational in every case is whether the compelled statement is

4

testimonial or communicative as opposed to a non-communicative

5

act or, in the case of a handwriting exemplar or voice print, a

6

statement that isn't intended to be used for its content in any

7

way.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

say, to the State of Colorado, would these records be
available?

11

MR. TIMBIE:

12

QUESTION:

13

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Suppose Colorado passed a law saying they

passed a bank secrecy act, would it be constitutional?

14
15

Mr. Timbie, if the scene were changed,

MR. TIMBIE:
know.

I simply don't

I would assume there would be a supremacy problem.
QUESTION:

16

I would assume not.

So, it's foreign venue that really is the

17

sticker here.

18

business reasons for having accounts in the Cayman Islands?
MR. TIMBIE:

19
20

What was the — does the record disclose any

The record discloses that Doe was

involved in international oil trading business.
QUESTION:

21

If one walks down the streets of Nassau,

22

which is foreign bank after foreign bank, and I haven't been in

23

the Cayman Islands, but I suppose it's the same reason, is --

24

are they there because they are refugees for what, tainted

25

money?
6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. TIMBIE:

1

Mr. Justice Blackmun, they are there for

2

all sorts of reasons, of course, but we feel that the problem

3

-- there is obviously a concern that the Government has in this

4

case that it is unable under certain circumstances to obtain

5

records of those foreign accounts.

6

We feel that the pertinent issue here is whether the

7

means that they've chosen in this case to obtain the records

8

offends the Fifth Amendment.

9

to obtain those records, they can compel an unwilling,

That is, whether when they want

10

unimmunized defendant or accused to speak on the Government's

11

behalf and then use the content of that speech to obtain the

12

records.

13

I would point out that there's no question that, as

14

Justice Scalia mentioned, there's no question that the

15

Government has an alternative means of getting these records

16

that would involve no Fifth Amendment problem, which would

17

simply be a show cause order against the banks that have

18

already been served subpoenas, and then a contempt hearing in

19

which the banks can be made to provide the records, unless they

20

could persuade the judge that the Cayman Islands interest in

21

the enforcement of its bank secrecy laws outweighs the U.S.

22

interest in the enforcement of its criminal tax laws.

23
24
25

And so far, very few banks have been able to win that
balance of test.
QUESTION:

Mr. Timbie, taking Justice Blackmun's
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

question about a Colorado bank one step further, supposing your

2

client had a safe deposit box in the Colorado bank and the

3

Government wanted the key, could they get it from him?
MR. TIMBIE:

4

That's an interesting question.

I would

5

argue that the act of producing the key might have testimonial

6

aspects —

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. TIMBIE:

9

Very similar to this case.
-- in John Doe, but setting that aside,

yes, they could, and they could because they were using a means

10
QUESTION:

11

12

MR. TIMBIE:

17
18

Oh, no, I certainly wouldn't, but I

thought you were asking a more general question as to -QUESTION:

15
16

Would you

set aside the testimonial significance of delivering the key?

13
14

But would you set that aside?

Whether they could require him to deliver

the key.
MR. TIMBIE:

They could certainly give him acts of

production immunity and require delivery.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. TIMBIE:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TIMBIE:

No, no.
Or if they knew -Without giving any kind of immunity.
If they knew to a certainty that the key

23

existed and they had it, they could make him give it and that's

24

because he would not be required to communicate in any way in

25

order to fulfill the order of the court.
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:

1

2

They could just subpoena the key and he'd

have to respond to the subpoena by delivering it?

3

MR. TIMBIE:

Unless he could establish in a Huffman

4

hearing that the Government would be learning of the existence

5

of the key or of his possession of it and that fact would be

6

incriminating under the Fisher rational.

7

it.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, don't we assume here the Government

already knows about the accounts?

10

MR. TIMBIE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TIMBIE:

13

He would have to give

Yes.
Yeah.

Okay.

Excuse me, Your Honor.

May I clarify

that answer?

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TIMBIE:

Yes.
The Government knows about eleven

16

accounts.

It has told the court below that it knows of a

17

twelfth account that is not in John Doe's name, but that it

18

believes was controlled by Doe and used in connection with

19

these illegal activities, and that one of the purposes of this

20

consent procedure is to obtain the records of that account,

21

assuming that they are, in fact, controlled by Doe.

22

The Government also wants records of any accounts of

23

which it knows nothing that would fall within the scope of the

24

consent.

25

QUESTION:

What if the Government — let's say

9
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

nothing is as esoteric as this situation, it's a murder

2

investigation, the Government issues a subpoena to a

3

prospective indictee, subpoena all the guns in your possession,

4

now can he defend against that on the grounds that producing

5

guns might incriminate him?

6

MR. TIMBIE:

The answer to your question lies not in

7

— I don't think lies in the issue before the Court today, but

8

in the extent to which the Court would extend Fisher and how

9

the court views the act of production rational, I could argue

10

that if the Government didn't know to a certainty that he

11

possessed any guns, and the fact that he possessed any gun

12

would be incriminating under the circumstances, that Fisher

13

should be extended to that.

14

QUESTION:

But Fisher didn't hold that there was any

15

significance to the act of production.

16

Fisher, but it wasn't decided.

17

MR. TIMBIE:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. TIMBIE:

20

22
23

It was debated in

Excuse me. It was in Doe that it was —
And Doe devoted about one paragraph to it.
My reading of Doe — I'm not sure I

understand the point that you're making.
QUESTION:

Well, my question is that the idea you're

pumping for may not be as well established as you think it is.
MR. TIMBIE:

We don't feel that it's established by

24

Fisher and Doe. We simply don't feel it's been taken away by

25

Fisher and Doe.

We

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. TIMBIE:

Prior to Fisher, where did it exist?
It existed in the so-called physical

3

evidence cases in which, beginning with the Holt case back in

4

1910, Justice Holmes announced a boundary to the Fifth

5

Amendment in terms of a requirement that the Government not

6

compel a witness or an accused to provide any form of testimony

7

or conduct that would be testimonial or communicative, and, in

8

fact, Justice Holmes' word was "communicative conduct" as

9

opposed to a demonstration of physical characteristics, and

10

subsequent cases, like Schmerber and Dionisio, Gilbert and

11

Wade, have all applied that line and, in fact, have described

12

protected conduct as conduct that is testimonial or

13

communicative in any way.

14

QUESTION:

Don't you think they mean communicative to

15

the fact-finder at the trial and not communicative to anyone in

16

the world?

17

think that the difference between this case and the key case,

18

where you say he can -- the Government can compel the

19

production of the key to the safe deposit box, assuming they

20

give immunity for the fact of the production of the key, right?

If I may pursue Justice Stevens' hypothetical, you

21

MR. TIMBIE:

22

QUESTION:

Right.
But you would say that even if they gave

23

immunity, they could not require him to tell the guard it's all

24

right to let these investigators in to get into my safe deposit

25

box.

If he has a private guard who will only let people in
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

with his consent, he can give the key but he can't tell the

2

guard, let these people in.

3

here.

4

MR. TIMBIE:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TIMBIE:

That's the line you're drawing

The line I'm drawing —
Because that's communicative.
— is that he cannot be made to speak

7

such that the Government would use the content of his speech to

8

obtain incriminating evidence unless that compelled speech is,

9

in fact, immunized. That is the line, and —
QUESTION:

10
11

You think that's a reasonable line between

giving the key and telling the guard, let these people in?
MR. TIMBIE:

12

The key hypothetical is an extraordinary

13

one.

14

would be to sign a directive instructing anyone, if they have

15

custody of the key that will allow access to incriminating

16

evidence, to turn it over to the U.S. Attorney and if the

17

Government feels that it could use that document somehow to

18

cause a third party to release the key to —

19
20
21

I should think that the genuine analogy in this case

QUESTION:

No, not to use at trial.

Not to use at a

trial anyway.
MR. TIMBIE:

Well, no, not to use at a trial, but if

22

there's a potential for using it at trial, obviously that's an

23

independent basis for finding Fifth Amendment violations.

24
25

If I may, there has not been a case, and we don't
contend there's been a case, in which this Court has directly
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

addressed a communication that was not testimonial in the sense

2

that the Government asserts.
We acknowledge that.

3

On the other side, there has

4

never been a case in which this Court has drawn the line that

5

the Government suggests and that line has somehow been relative

6

to the holding. That is, there is no case in which this Court

7

has allowed a compelled communication on the ground that it did

8

not communicate facts about an offense or disclose information

9

that might lead directly or indirectly —

10

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask another question then?

11

Supposing the Grand Jury subpoenaed somebody and asked them to

12

provide them with a handwriting sample of the person's

13

signature, which I guess they can do if they are just trying to

14

compare it with the pre-existing signature, but are you saying

15

that they could not take that signature and go to other parties

16

and say, have you ever seen a signature like this one?
MR. TIMBIE:

17

Oh, absolutely.

There's no question

18

they could do that.

24
25

The reason they could do that is set forth

The reason they could do that is that it is the

Therefore, there's no Fifth

They can use it against him in any way they

QUESTION:

Not only -- they could use it to gather

evidence that might incriminate him. That's what I'm saying.
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

2

Take that signature around and ask people, have you seen -MR. TIMBIE:

That's what Gilbert -- that's what

3

Schmerber says, certainly.

Schmerber says that although the

4

logic of the underlying principles of the Fifth Amendment would

5

suggest that you can't even compel assistance from a defendant

6

in the form of turning over physical evidence, this Court

7

declines to extend the Fifth Amendment beyond testimony or

8

communication, and, therefore, in Gilbert, the Court said the

9

handwriting exemplar could be compelled specifically because it

10

was not the content, it was not any form of testimony or

11

communication out of the defendant's mouth that was the purpose

12

or use of the exemplar.

13

And, in fact, I would certainly argue that if, in the

14

guise of taking a handwriting exemplar, the Government were to

15

make Joe write out a document, write these words, I consent to

16

disclosure of my foreign bank records, and they were then to

17

take that handwriting exemplar to the bank and attempt to pass

18

it off as a consent, I would certainly argue that it would be a

19

communication.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Timbie, what actual potential use of

the form do you say is testimonial here?
MR. TIMBIE:

There are two uses and, in fact, there

23

are principal and alternative arguments in the case. The first

24

use is taking the form to the bank and presenting it to the

25

bank as a communication of Doe's consent and an assurance from
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Doe that he won't revoke that consent and won't later argue

2

that it was invalidly granted.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that much like taking

blood or getting the handwriting sample?
MR. TIMBIE:

In the words of Schmerber, blood and

6

handwriting samples are sought for their physical

7

characteristics, not for any compelled communication they might

8

entail, whereas that is sought for a compelled communication,

9

and I recognize that there's no direct authority that can be

10

cited that would cause the Court to choose between the

11

Government's line and our line, but I would --

12
13

QUESTION:

Direct authority meaning physical evidence

in a sense?

14

MR. TIMBIE:

15

QUESTION:

Surely.
Mr. Timbie, in the absence of any direct

16

authority, maybe we're compelled to fall back upon the language

17

of the Fifth Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

That's a drastic step.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

I hate to suggest it, but the —• it

20

does not read that no one shall be compelled to communicate in

21

such fashion as to harm his case.

22

compelled to be a witness against himself.

23
24
25

It says no one shall be

Now, how is this action here causing this individual
to be a witness against himself?
MR. TIMBIE:

Justice Scalia, I would submit,
15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

respectfully, that if this Court were to fall back on the

2

language of the Fifth Amendment, it would have to overrule a

3

great deal of precedent in addition to not following --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. TIMBIE:

Why is that?
Because the language of the Fifth

6

Amendment suggests that what we're concerned about here is

7

compelled confessions, and the reason — the initial reason

8

that compelled confessions were considered inappropriate was

9

that they're untrustworthy and unseemingly.
QUESTION:

10

But it's easy to extend it to any

11

testimonial utterance by the defendant that can be used against

12

him at trial.

13

trial.

14

That can be used for its truth against him at

MR. TIMBIE:

Well, and then the Court has then gone

15

on to say that under Kastigar, the Fifth Amendment would

16

require that in addition, any leads that came out of the

17

testimony would have to be protected and any evidence derived

18

directly or indirectly from it.

19
20
21

Perhaps I could come at your question from the other
direction.
QUESTION:

Once you establish the violation, there

22

are all sorts of fruits of the tree that also fall out. Why

23

isn't it enough to say the violation has to be some testimony,

24

some assertion of a fact or the truth that he makes which is

25

used at trial against him?
16

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. TIMBIE:

I can't argue that there is a compelling

2

logical reason why the line has to be drawn where we suggest.

3

I would like, if I may, to come at the answer to your argument

4

from the other direction and suggest some types of compelled

5

communication that would apparently be allowable under the

6

Government's rule that I feel would not be within the spirit of

7

the Fifth Amendment and certainly would not be within the

8

traditional scope of the Fifth Amendment as it has been applied

9

over the last hundreds of years.

10

Let me take, if I may, the Government's own rational

11

for why, in their words, the document Doe is being asked to

12

sign is a non-assertive document and, therefore, the Government

13

would divide the universe of communications, of course, into

14

assertive communications that continue to be protected and so-

15

called non-assertive communications that aren't protected, and

16

the rational for putting this consent directive in the non-

17

assertive title under the Government's view, there are three of

18

them offered.

19

One is that it is an imperative statement issued to a

20

third party and should be simply treated as a verbal act.

21

the corollary it seems to me of that rational is that any

22

imperative statement is outside the Fifth Amendment, so long as

23

the Government is not using it as an admission of fact.

24
25

Now,

Does that mean that in a bank robbery investigation,
the Government could get a court order that the first suspect

arrested call up or write to an alleged accomplice and tell

2

him, bring the loot to the corner of Fifth and Main, we'll go

3

some place and divide it up and then wait and see what happens?
I would contend that that is not faithful to the

4
5

command of the Fifth Amendment or the policy of the Fifth

6

Amendment, that the Government will shoulder the entire load in

7

an investigation and not -QUESTION:

Pardon me, ma'am.

I'm sorry.

I wanted to know what testimonial use of

You said —

presentation of the document to the bank is a testimonial use

23

because it's a use of content.

24
25

In the alternative, if the Government -- if the Court
adopts the Government's view that this is — that there is a

1

difference between assertive and non-assertive communications,

2

then I think it would still be a testimonial use and it is the

3

use identified in Ranauro which, in the First Circuit's

4

decision in Ranauro, which held this procedure to be

5

unconstitutional, Ranauro presented a hypothetical that framed

6

the issue in which a consent directive was signed and presented

7

to a foreign bank and the bank produced records of an account

8

that wasn't in the name of the person who signed the consent

9

directive, and it seems clear that under those circumstances,

10

the statement in the consent, I authorize disclosure of records

11

of accounts over which I have the right of withdrawal, becomes

12

testimonial evidence that he has the right of withdrawal, and

13

it would be evidence that could be used in a criminal trial

14

against him unless he were given immunity from the act of

15

signing the document.

20

Well, I assume the Government could take

I am not sure how that would be

possible.
QUESTION:

Well, we could play around with the words,

21

I suppose, but it would say without acknowledging that I have

22

control, you are authorized to release any accounts over which

23

I do have control.

24
25

MR. TIMBIE:

No.

I believe the document was

redrafted once in order to do exactly what you're suggesting.
19

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

That is, make it at the time it is signed not an

2

acknowledgement of control of ready accounts, but what the

3

Ranauro court said is that no matter how hypothetically it's

4

drafted and vaguely it's drafted, the process server who went

5

to the bank could then get on the stand, -- the Brown decision

6

in the Second Circuit says that you can authenticate and get

7

admission of records by putting on the process server who

8

served the subpoena and say this is what I asked for and here's

9

what I got, and that's authentication.

10

In this case, the process server could say or the

11

Government attorney or an agent who delivered the consent could

12

say, I went to the bank and demanded the records, they said no

13

because the customer has to consent.

14

Doe's consent, this is what they gave me.

15

I went to the bank with

I'm not sure that would be adequate to authenticate

16

the records, but it would be some evidence of a link between

17

Doe and those accounts, and the Government explicitly refuses

20
Heritage Reporting Corporation

628-4888

1

Let me ask you just one other question.

You've

2

argued the case so far in order to show that there's a

3

testimonial component to this statement.

4

Does your case rise or fall on that?

If we were to

5

rule that there is no testimonial component, does your case

6

necessarily fail?

7

MR. TIMBIE:

8

QUESTION:

9

That is —
That's another way of asking whether or

not the Fifth Amendment has another ingredient and that is that

10

the accused simply can't be asked to do too much to make the

11

case against him.

12

MR. TIMBIE:

I would have to say that in our view,

13

the traditional Fifth Amendment rule is that too much and

14

communication are the same thing, that the Court has said too

15

much in terms of production of physical evidence, giving blood

16

samples, being forced to speak in your own voice in a line-up

17

and repeat what was said, that's a lot.

18

But the bright line the Court has drawn in case after

19

case is between physical evidence, acts that have no

20

communicative content, and communication, and I think that in

21

my view, too much and that line are the same thing.

22

Having already given the hypothetical -- excuse me. I

23

only ended up giving one of the explanations that the

24

Government uses to show that this is a non-assertive

25

communication under its rule, and there are two others that
21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

suggest two other categories of communications that it would

2

view as unprotected.

3

One is the Government argues in its brief that this

4

is a non-assertive communication because the Government put the

5

words in Doe's mouth, and the Court ordered him to say it, and,

6

therefore, it wouldn't be right to treat them as words of Doe

7

or as communications from Doe.

8
9

Now, the Government is clearly trying to have it both
ways there. It wants to take this document to the bank and say

10

to the bank, this is Doe's consent, only he can give it,

11

there's his signature.

12

Court and says, you should treat it as an act devoid of content

13

because we told him what to say.

14

On the other hand, it comes to this

If the Government's right there, then presumably

15

unimmunized witnesses could be made to cooperate in an

16

investigation so long as the Government told them what to say.

17

For example, if you imagine a complex conspiracy

18

investigation in which, as is often true, the prosecutor knows

19

what went on and knows who the players were, but can't because

20

it doesn't have a cooperating witnesses establish these

21

conspiratorial links that are necessary for the conspiracy

22

indictment, it would theoretically under the Government's view

23

be proper to have a court order an unimmunized alleged co­

24

conspirator to call up other parties and make statements

25

calculated to cause the other parties to incriminate themselves
22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and if that were to work, then the incriminating statements

2

might equally well incriminate the person doing the calling out

3

of his own mouth.
QUESTION:

4

I'm not sure the Government — that it

5

would be all right to do that.-

6

that order might not itself violate the Fifth Amendment.

7

MR. TIMBIE:

I think they would argue that

That's correct, and then they would

8

order that the defendants in the ultimate indictment would have

9

to come up with some trickery rational to preclude it.
My point is that it seems to me that is making him

10
11

convict himself out of his own mouth and if it's a question of

12

what is too much, that that should be too much.

13

QUESTION:

It seems to me that, too, Mr. Timbie, but

14

are you sure it's the Fifth Amendment that makes it bad?

15

don't think the Government could ask John Doe out on the street

16

to do that either.
MR. TIMBIE:

MR. TIMBIE:

I don't think you could ask

If you're suggesting that there would be

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a jurisdiction problem in a District Court issuing such an

2

order, I would agree and we made that argument below and the

3

Fifth Circuit ruled there was jurisdiction for this prosecutor

4

or John Doe to assist the Government in its investigation in

5

that way, even though the controversy was between the banks and

6

the Government.
If you're suggesting that setting aside jurisdiction,

7

8

there's some per se rule why that is improper, I don't know

9

what the rule is.

I think in order to police that kind of

10

conduct, you need a Fifth Amendment rule that encompasses all

11

communications.

12
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Timbie, do you have any comment on the

amicus brief that was filed by Rex Lee?

14

MR. TIMBIE:

My only comment is, as I said earlier in

15

the argument, the issue — there's a sham quality to what's

16

going on here, and I think that that is pointed out in the

17

amicus brief.

18

the Cayman Islands has ruled that a compelled consent is not a

19

consent for purposes of its law.

The Cayman Islands have ruled, the high court of

So, what the Government is trying to obtain is on its

20
21

face an invalid document, and the Government has said we want

22

to use that document nonetheless in a U.S. court in the

23

balancing test in hopes that it will be thrown on our side of

24

the scale, notwithstanding its patent invalidity in the Cayman

25

Islands.
24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I don't think the issue of whether it is a valid

1

2

document is determinative of the Fifth Amendment question in

3

this case, and I believe what the Cayman Islands were saying is

4

that that's an issue that ought not be addressed in this

5

proceeding because it hasn't been framed in the record below.

6
7

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.

10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13
14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I think it's helpful at the outset to make clear

15

exactly what is not controverted in this case.

16

agree that the bank records sought by the Government are not

17

themselves privileged under the Fifth Amendment.

18

agree that the banks that hold the documents can't assert the

19

Fifth Amendment in declining to turn them over.

20

Both sides

Both sides

Both sides agree that the Petitioner has no Fifth

21

Amendment right to keep the banks from disclosing the

22

documents. Both sides agree the Government has to find the

23

banks where Petitioner has his accounts through its own

24

investigation and once the Government does find those accounts,

25

both sides agree that the only thing that will keep the banks
25

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

from surrendering the account records are foreign bank secrecy-

2

laws that have no force in the United States.

3
4
5

I think Mr. Timbie acknowledged all these points in
his argument.
Nonetheless, Petitioner insists that the Fifth

6

Amendment somehow gives him a constitutional right to continue

7

to enjoy the protection of the foreign bank secrecy laws, even

8

though the act of waiving that protection, the consent form

9

itself, concededly does not give the Government any information

10

11

that will advance its investigation.
QUESTION:

It really doesn't waive the protection as

12

was just pointed out.

I mean, and even if the amicus brief had

13

not been filed, it's obviously the simplest thing in the world

14

for any foreign country who has these bank laws and, indeed, it

15

would be idiotic if they didn't, once this case is decided the

16

way you want it decided, for them to simply say, moreover,

17

compelled consent is not sufficient.

18

contract and then you can do these proceedings forever and it

19

will never get you the information you want.

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

21

response to that, Justice Scalia.

22

That will be in the bank

Well, let me say several things in

Idiotic or not, the fact does have some effect.

It

23

is true that a court in the Cayman Islands has concluded that

24

as a matter of Cayman laws, these consent forms are in effect

25

if that decision was not appealed.

So, Cayman law, I think, is

26

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

not settled.
But there are other jurisdictions that have, even

3

assuming that that settles Cayman law for all time, there are

4

other jurisdictions that have bank secrecy provisions either by

5

statute or by common law, including Bermuda and the United

6

Kingdom, Bermuda is involved in this case, and my understanding

7

is although there are no reported cases from those

8

jurisdictions, in fact, banks in those jurisdictions comply

9

with these compel consents because they interpret their common

10

law bank secrecy protections as having an exception for when

11

compel consent forms of this kind are used.

12

So,

I think that they are useful and, of course,

13

there are a great many other jurisdictions that have widely

14

varying kinds of bank secrecy laws. So, this is not a sham

15

proceeding, and I should say, in addition, to the extent that a

16

consent form won't be useful for us, that's our problem.

17

is not a solution to the Petitioner's case here.

18

have any bearing on the Fifth Amendment question of whether it

19

can be compelled to execute the consent, which we can then try

20

to use in a foreign jurisdiction.

21

So,

That

It doesn't

I think it is extremely useful proceeding.

I

22

should add one additional practical point.

23

Mr. Timbie suggested that we can simply obtain these records

24

easily enough by serving subpoenas on the domestic branches of

25

foreign banks, that's not entirely true because those banks can

To the extent that

27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

contest subpoenas and argue that under comity principles, they

2

should not be required to surrender the records, and I'm sure

3

that the banks, and Mr. Timbie if he were in a position to do

4

so, would argue that they should not surrender those records.

5

So far as banks that don't have branches in the

6

United States are concerned, in which you must attempt to

7

obtain records by going to foreign nations, under comity

8

principles, foreign courts are often reluctant to help other

9

countries enforce their revenue laws.

10
11

So, these consent forms

may be the only'way for us to obtain this information.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, do you take the position

12

that the Government can introduce into evidence for any purpose

13

whatever the consent form?

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Let me answer that question in two

parts, Justice O'Connor.

19

to do so, it would not present any Fifth Amendment problem, and

is we do not think that this would be admissible.

QUESTION:

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's right.

-- in your view?
That's correct.

Even for authentication?
Well, as I suggest, we don't think it

8

would happen, but, no, we do not think the Fifth Amendment

9

would prohibit if someone could possibly imagine a situation in

10

which the bank consent form were introduced, and I think that

11

that comes clear from the nature of the Fifth Amendment

12

guarantee that the Petitioner is trying to call upon here.

13

We think the Court has al-ready settled the principles

14

that control this case and has settled them against the

15

Petitioner.

16

and I'll return to your question and address it in detail when

17

I set out the background which I think provides the answer to

18

your question, but the Court has made it quite clear that the

19

Fifth Amendment can be asserted only when the Government tries

20

to compel someone to do something that is incriminating and

21

testimonial, and we think the Court has made equally clear time

22

and again that something is testimonial only as that word

23

suggests, it has the nature of testimony.

24

25

The Court has made it very clear, we think, that,

2

put his signature on a consent form, requires him to perform a

3

testimonial act within the meaning of this Court's decisions,

4

and we think that it quite clearly does not.
There should not be any controversy about the meaning

5
6

of the word testimony in the Fifth Amendment setting.

7

Court, in its opinion in Fisher, we think, made it quite clear

8

that something is testimonial when it involves, in the Court's

9

words,

The

""truth telling'' by the witness, by the suspect, and

10

the Court has made it quite clear, made it quite clear the

11

kinds of things that are not testimony.

12

QUESTION:

But if the consent form were to be offered

13

to establish that these are the records, the bank records,

14

belonging to the Defendant, I find it hard to understand why

15

that wouldn't be testimonial.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, if a bank produces records in

17

response to a subpoena accompanied by a consent form, the bank

18

may be making an implicit statement that it thinks the records,

19

as Justice Kennedy suggested, that it thinks the records belong

20

to the suspect. But the suspect himself isn't making any

21

statement and he has no right to keep the bank silent.

22

The suspect in that case is --

23

QUESTION:

But if the Government introduces the

24

consent form, then perhaps it is the suspect who is making the

25

statement.

(202)

628-4888

MR. ROTHFELD:

1

Well, I don't think so, Justice

2

O'Connor.

that are not testimonial. Something is not testimonial simply

4

because it makes the suspect the source of incriminating

5

evidence.

The Court has made quite clear the kinds of things

That was the holding in Schmerber, where a suspect

because it may lead to the production of incriminating evidence

where suspects were required to put on clothing worn by the

12

perpetrator of the crime to facilitate witness identification.
QUESTION:

14

Do you have to resort then to saying this

is a verbal act to say it isn't testimonial?
MR. ROTHFELD:

15

We don't think we have to resort to

certainly acknowledge — if the consent form set out

MR. ROTHFELD:

14

Our position is compelling someone to

15

produce something when there is leaving aside of the

16

testimonial aspects attendant upon the act of production.

17

There is no Fifth Amendment problem.

And to the extent that

ft

18

Petitioner had in his possession a bit of evidence and it was

19

conceded that the evidence was in his possession, he was not

20

disputing -- he was not saying there will be any testimonial

21

component to his turning over to the Government, there is no

22

Fifth Amendment privilege because the Fifth Amendment, the

23

Court has said time and again, can be asserted only when the

24

suspect is compelled to do something which has a testimonial

25

component, which involves his truth telling, and the simple

fact that it will lead to -- well, the Court held — it made it

2

quite clear that the simple fact that the suspect is required

3

to manufacture incriminating evidence does not by itself make

4

it testimonial.
That was the holding in Gilbert and in Wade and in

He is not being asked to turn over anything in

He is simply being asked to sign a piece of paper

and Bermuda and will allow banks to turn over documents in

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, if there is no

10

testimonial component and you're satisfied that the Government

11

would not offer it for any testimonial purpose, why not give

12

limited use immunity to protect against any testimonial

13

component that might be thought to be present?

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I am not sure that I can give

15

you a compelling answer to that, Justice O'Connor.

16

that our view has been that this is simply not the testimonial

17

sort of thing which is going to appear in evidence.

18

the issue of whether or not immunity has to be provided against

19

use of the consent form in evidence, whether or not that should

20

be granted.

21

I think

Therefore,

I think that there may be concerns of granting

22

immunity and if that is imagined to be a concession that there

23

is a testimonial component may lead to fruits arguments when

24

records are produced.

25

We think that there is no necessity for the grant of
37

immunity because there is no testimonial component.

no Fifth Amendment —

you take it around to all the different banks in the Cayman

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Could you do that?

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

The Court has made clear, Justice

15

Marshall, that the crucial point is whether or not the witness

16

is compelled to do something that is testimonial in nature.

17

the bank produces these records and the bank makes its

18

statement that these are the records that belong to the

19

Petitioner, that is the bank statement and we are free to use

20

it.

21

If

The fact that the Petitioner has done something that

22

allows us to obtain the evidence, and I think this answers

23

questions that were posed by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy

24

and Justice Stevens, that does not raise a Fifth Amendment

25

problem.

It is quite clear in a case where the suspect
42
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

provides a handwriting exemplar or voice exemplar.

2

is required to do something that would lead other parties to

3

produce very incriminating evidence.

4

The suspect

The suspect provides a handwriting exemplar and the

5

Government obtains handwriting experts who develop complex

6

analyses and produce evidence and testify themselves.

incriminating evidence from third parties, but that not raise

the Fifth Amendment problem.
The Court made that clear eighty years ago in Holt

12

and has repeatedly reaffirmed that principle.

13

the suspect is required to do something himself that is

14

testimonial that Justice Scalia pointed out in some sense makes

15

him a witness against himself.

Now, to return very briefly to the hypothetical, I'm

22

not sure which number hypothetical it is, but one of the

hypotheticals offered by Justice Stevens or Justice Scalia, if

25

that is not a Fifth Amendment problem.

Whether or not the

Court's power under the All Writs Act, even assuming it had the

power to compel the suspect to drive the car, extends to the

aunt may be a difficult question, but it's not presented here.

4

The only issue raised by the Petitioner is the Fifth

Amendment.
QUESTION:

On the aunt question, I'm not sure it

7

would offend.

If she had custody of the vehicle and you

8

subpoenaed the vehicle and ordered her to produce it, I don't

know why that would offend me.

Maybe if she has to hire

10

somebody else to do the driving, but I think she'd have to

11

bring it into court.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that involves a meeting

13

of the All Writs Act or other jurisdictional provisions that I

14

don't want to get into.

15

Government had other means of effectuating the subpoena.

#

16

It may turn on whether or not the

But that is not a question here.

The question here

17

is the Fifth Amendment problem, and Petitioner has not offered

18

any reason to believe that what he is required to do here

19

implicates the language, the policies of the Fifth Amendment or

20

any decision of this Court.

21

Now, the Court, as I said before, has made very clear

22

that it's only when there is a testimonial component to the

23

compelled action, compelled statement, that there's a Fifth

24

Amendment problem.

25

QUESTION:

We have also said that the Fifth Amendment
44
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

stands for the fact that we have an accusatorial system and not

2

an inquisitorial system, but you think that's all dictum and

3

there must be a testimonial component to the Act.
MR. ROTHFELD:

4

Well, I don't think -- I wouldn't

5

characterize it as dictum.

6

for the line the Court has drawn in requiring testimonial

7

component.

8

I think that that is the rational

The Court has taken the view that when a suspect is

9

required to speak his guilt and disclose the contents of his

10

mind to the Government, that becomes an inquisitorial type of

11

proceeding.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but you know, it's a very interesting

13

question. I'm not sure we've focused on it very often.

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

They made him

Well, offhand, I'm not aware of any

20

authority directly addressing that question, Justice Stevens.

21

Unfortunately, that is certainly not anything close to the

22

issue in this case.

23

I mean, there is no doubt in the case, in your

24

hypothetical, the witness has been -- the suspect has been

25

compelled to say something testimonial, to disclose what he
45

Heritage Reporting Corporation

knows about the crime, to make factual assertions that are true

2

or false.

3

That is not true here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, are you asserting on behalf

4

of the Government the power to get this individual to do

5

because he's a defendant anything that you couldn'.t get the

6

private individual to do who is not a defendant?

put it in the context of this case, could you have made

could you have gotten a similar order directed against someone

That is, to

implicated in the conspiracy at all, could you have gotten this

on the proposition that that is not a question that's presented

in this case because we think that in that situation, there

You don't understand the point of my

what we can allow you to do to a defendant. If all you're

5

coming in and saying, we can ask this defendant to produce

anything we can ask anyone else to produce, so long as it is

not testimonial, that's one position.
If what you're arguing on the other hand is some

I'm looking for some limitation on what we can get,

couldn't ask non-defendants to do, that's something quite

Now, which of the two is your position here?

MR. ROTHFELD:

It is the first.

We are not saying

So far -- once again, to return to the question that

1

y

2

concerns Justice Scalia, so far as the Fifth Amendment is

3

concerned, it creates a general bar, a limited but general bar

on what the Government can do to people and compel them to do,

5

whether or not they are defendants or targets or whatever.
So far as grants of authority to the District Court

6

r

7

can exercise jurisdiction over people, there may or may not be

8

distinctions granted in the jurisdictional statute, but that is

9

not the question here.

10

only one question and that is the Fifth Amendment question, and

11

as I said before, he offers no reason to believe that the Fifth

12

Amendment prohibits the Government from doing what it did in

Justice Stevens' safe deposit hypothetical, it's simply a

All he has done is

This is simply permitting the Government to obtain
evidence that can be used against him at trial.

The evidence

that will be provided by third parties.
Now, there's nothing in the language, certainly in

16

the purposes of the Fifth Amendment, or in any of this Court's

17

decision as Petitioner concedes that requires the Court to rule

18

for him in this case.

19

we think this Court should affirm its decision.

The Court of Appeals recognized that and

MR. TIMBIE:

Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Rothfeld took issue with our waiver of the

1

y

2

attorney-client privilege hypothetical, saying that, of course,

3

the attorney-client privilege is self-policing because any

4

lawyer in his right mind isn't going to accept the compelled

5

consent directive as a valid waiver.

6

But the Government offers a broader rational here,

7

even in the waiver area.

8

can force an unwilling, unimmunized witness to sign any waiver

9

that would merely be — would allow it to overcome a non­

10

constitutional impediment to access the third party records.

11

/

What it is saying there is that it

There are other statutory privileges that this

12

procedure could be used for that would not give rise to self­

13

policing mechanisms through --

14

QUESTION?

Immunity wouldn't be any — you wouldn't

15

say if the Government were to compel him to consent to a waiver

16

of his attorney-client privilege, that would be all right if he

17

were immunized?

18

apart from the Fifth Amendment.

19

MR. TIMBIE:

I mean, that is bad, but for a reason quite

I wholeheartedly agree, but what the

20

Government is saying in this case is that you shouldn't look at

21

this through a Fifth Amendment lens because it will be policed

22

elsewhere.

23

What we're saying is the Government shouldn't be able

24

to give it a try by forcing you to sign that document.

25

of, for example, a state evidentiary privilege.

The

accountant-client privilege.

Spousal privilege, for example.

It may well be the Government could get a consent directive,
get a spouse or accountant to go into a Grand Jury and talk to
the police, never introduce the testimony in evidence, so there
would never be a suppression hearing, but use the fruits.
We contend that the only way to police that is with
the Fifth Amendment, not with some Fourth Amendment notion.
Getting back to Justice O'Connor's question, she
asked the Government whether they felt they could use this
document in evidence, and the Government said yes.

No Fifth

Amendment problem, and we don't -- but we wouldn't try.
We state that that is constructive use immunity which
is not allowed in this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Timbie.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:03 o'clock a.m.,, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
