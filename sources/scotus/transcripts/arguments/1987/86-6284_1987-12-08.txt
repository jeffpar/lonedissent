Mr. Woods, you may present whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. WOODS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WOODS:

7

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is a criminal case from the State of Texas,

10

involving a death penalty which was imposed on the Petitioner,

11

and a case that was tried in 1979, error complained of and the

12

question presented before the Court is whether there was a

13

denial of effective assistance to counsel in the allowing of

14

testimony of Dr. James P. Grigson, a Dallas psychiatrist,

15

during the punishment phase of the Defendant's trial.

16

The complained-of error is couched on this Court's

17

decision in Estelle v. Smith in that counsel was not advised

18

nor notified previously to the order appointing Dr. Grigson to

19

examine the Defendant for two reasons.

20

of determining competency to stand trial and the other was the

21

purpose of determining future dangerousness.

One was for the purpose

QUESTION:

MR. WOODS:

Yes, sir, it was.

Defendant.

The Defendant was not examined by Dr. Grigson till

8

So, counsel should have

This is the same Dr. Grigson that appears

in every Texas case or did appear?

10

MR. WOODS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WOODS;

Yes, sir.
Is he now deceased?
No.

I believe he's still practicing,

I

13

don't believe he is testifying anymore in these types of cases,

14

at least I have not heard.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Woods, what's the role of defense

16

counsel in connection with one of these examinations by a

17

psychiatrist in Texas?

18

MR. WOODS::

Justice, the role as far as the defense

19

counsel would be is to determine or to at least advise the

20

client of the scope of the examination.

21

impact of it could be, what ramifications could be derived from

22

it.

23

25

QUESTION:

Let him know what the

The attorney doesn't actually sit in and

participate at the time of the examination.
MR. WOODS :

Such a request, of course, was not made

and I don't think the attorney would necessarily —

2
3

QUESTION:

But it doesn't normally occur,

is that

right?

4

MR. WOODS:

5

QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.
It would simply be a matter of

6

consultation of some kind with the defendant in advance of the

7

examination?
MR. WOODS:

8

9

To let him know what the ramifications

could possibly be as to the examination.
QUESTION:

10

Now, there were two other doctors

11

appointed in this instance to examine Mr, Satterwhite, is that

12

right?

13

MR. WOODS:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes. That was Dr. Holbrook, I believe.
And in each case, did his attorney advise

-- were you representing him below?

16

MR. WOODS:

17

QUESTION:

18

each of those examinations?

19

MR. WOODS:

20

QUESTION:

22

MR. WOODS:

23

QUESTION:

25

Did you talk to him in advance of those —

I was not advised.

First of all, Dr.

Holbrook did not examine Mr. Satterwhite.

21

24

Yes, I was.

There was a psychologist who did.
Dr. Betty Lou Schroeder.
Yes, and did you talk to Mr. Satterwhite

before that examination?
MR. WOODS:

Dr. Schroeder examined Mr. Satterwhite on
5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

March 16th, before I was appointed to represent him.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. WOODS:

And not again?
The testimony that was elicited in the

4

trial shows that she talked to him on several occasions.

5

specifically when is unknown to anybody.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WOODS:

Now,

That testimony is not challenged.
Well, basically, it is challenged, but,

8

of course, it's challenged through the means of the complaint

9

of Dr. Grigson, because of Dr. Grigson's impact on the jury,

10

which, of course, is buttressed by the state's argument. They

11

argued and supported their position for the death penalty and

12

for the affirmative findings of Special Issue Number 2, stating

13

that Dr. Grigson's a Dallas psychiatrist and a medical doctor

14

and not referring to just a mere county-employed psychologist.

15

And, so, the impact to the jury was very great.

Of

16

course, the impact of Dr. Grigson to any jury is devastating

17

and it's for those reasons for which, of course, —

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Now, what was the April 18th order signed

by the Court?
MR. WOODS:

That was the — there was an order

21

signed. That was the order for appointment of a Dr. Holbrook

22

and Dr. Schroeder to examine the Defendant for purposes of

23

mental competency.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WOODS:

And you knew about that order?
No, ma'am.

QUESTION:

Never?
Did not — was not told.

I was not

QUESTION:

5

MR. WOODS:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WOODS:

Never looked at the file?
I saw the file several times.
You did not see that order in the file?
Well,

I can only tell you from my own

8

personal observation and knowledge, I didn't see that order in

9

the file

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WOODS:

But it was there?
Well,

I tell you, I saw the file on,

I

12

can say, two occasions, both of which I did not see the order

13

in the file nor did I see Dr. Grigson's letter that he wrote on

14

May 3rd.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WOODS:

I'm talking about the April 18th order.
The April 18th order did not surface

17

until after, I'd say it was, about the middle of May, and

18

that's when I prepared several motions which were filed May

19

29th.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WOODS:

Isn't there a copy of that for each case?
The entry of a docket sheet as to that

23

right now, was not necessarily entered, as I could see

QUESTION:

25

MR. WOODS:

Well, has it ever been entered?
I don't remember.

I couldn't tell you.

1

I suppose if it's on the docket, entered

on the docket sheet and there's a date on it, that's what you

usually look at to see what's in a file.

MR. WOODS:

QUESTION:

6

MR. WOODS:

7

because sometimes they keep -QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, sir.
Did you look at it?
I looked.

I did look at the docket sheet

Well, don't you think you ought to look at

the docket sheet?
MR. WOODS:

10

Well, that's true, but, Your Honor, the

11

point is that in examining the file — first of all, the order

12

that was presented in front of the Judge, after I was appointed

13

as counsel, was not even -- in fact,

14

any notice for it.

15

QUESTION:

I was not even provided

Without notice —
Wouldn't Texas practice ordinarily provide

16

that if there's an attorney of record for the Defendant, that a

17

copy of that -- at least a proposed formal order would be

18

served?

19

MR. WOODS:

As far as I'm concerned, yes.

In every

20

court I've practiced in, there's always been a notice or

21

certificate of service to opposing counsel.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WOODS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WOODS:

What date were you appointed?
April 10th,

I believe, yes.

I was —

the Judge.

QUESTION:

3

MR. WOODS:

4

QUESTION:

5

And you didn't see it until May some time?
I didn't see it until mid-May.
Is this the Schroeder order or the Grigson

order?
MR. WOODS:

6

This is actually the Holbrook order.

7

There was never an order for Dr. Grigson.

9

QUESTION:

He came in under the

I thought that the order pursuant to which

10

Schroeder examined your client was entered before you were

11

appointed.
MR. WOODS:

12

13

That order was entered the day

after he was arrested.

14
15

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

What order is it we're talking about?

What were the contents of the order entered on April 18th?

16

MR. WOODS:

The contents of the order on April 18th

17

dealt with the appointment of Drs. Holbrook and Schroeder to

18

examine John Satterwhite for purposes of determining competency

19

to stand trial and to determine whether or not he would be a

20

continuing threat to society in the future.

21
22

QUESTION:

Holbrook or the other expert testimony, are you?

You're not directly challenging either the

There was no expert testimony from

Holbrook.

MR, WOODS:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

I am effectively challenging —
You’re not saying that it was a violation

of the Sixth Amendment to have permitted her to testify?
MR, WOODS:

Her testimony came in based upon her

5

examination at a time prior to counsel being appointed and

6

then, as she testified, at a time after counsel was appointed.

7

She said and the record should reflect that she was aware of

8

counsel being appointed but did not notify counsel of her

9

examinations.

10
11
12
13

QUESTION:

But, now, was that point raised in the

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?
MR. WOODS:

The point was raised more towards Dr.

Grigson than it was --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WOODS:

16

QUESTION:

Much more, almost to the exclusion of —
I'll have to agree.

That's true.

So, but, now, do you challenge the

17

Sehroeder testimony here, not having challenged it in the Texas

18

Court of Criminal Appeals?

20
21
22
23
24

MR. WOODS:

Well, it was challenged in the Motion for

Rehearing in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
QUESTION:

And what did the Texas Court of Criminal

Appeals do with the Motion for Rehearing?
MR. WOODS:

They did not write an opinion.

They

denied the Motion for Rehearing.

Holbrook.

MR. WOODS:

QUESTION:

12

MR. WOODS:

Yes, ma'am.
Did they practice together?

I don't recall where exactly Dr. Holbrook

13

is from.

14

also be from Dallas. I'm not sure.

15

Is that --

He is from the North Texas area, I believe.

QUESTION:

At the beginning of the argument,

He may

I asked

16

you whether Dr. Grigson's examination was pursuant to court

17

order, and I thought you said yes.

Well, of course, technically, he was not

23
24
25

QUESTION:

He testified that he examined the

That is the basis of what his

Do you accept that, that he was examining

him pursuant to some order?
MR. WOODS:

I can only accept that because he wrote a
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

letter to the trial judge on May 8th, about five days after he

2

examined the Defendant.

3
4

QUESTION:

specifically names Dr. Grigson?

5

MR. WOODS:

6

QUESTION:

7

There is not.
Did the same judge that appointed you sign

the order of April 18th?

8

MR. WOODS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Is there any court order which

Yes.
And didn't send you a copy after he

appointed you?

11

MR. WOODS:

No copy.

12

It's not so much the substance of the testimony, of

13

the psychiatric testimony or the psychological testimony,

14

the lack of notice to counsel, the opportunity to at least

15

advise the client of what the ramifications of the examination

16

could be.
QUESTION:

17

Well, Mr. Woods,

it's

let me ask you this.

You

18

say no harmless error standard can be applied. What if the

19

state had not put Dr. Grigson on the stand but, in fact, had

20

had Dr. Grigson examine the Defendant and simply didn't use the

21

testimony?

22

error and it's error per se?

23
24
25

Would you be making the same argument, that that's

MR. WOODS:

If Dr. Grigson did not testify, I may not

be here today.
QUESTION:

Why not?

You're saying that it's the
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

appointment without notice to you that creates the problem.
MR. WOODS:

If Dr. Grigson had, as was in Barefoot v.

Texas,

counsel and he did examine him --

5

if Dr. Grigson had,

QUESTION:

in fact, — notice been provided to

No, no, no notice provided to you.

6

like you say happened here, and Dr. Grigson examined the

7

Defendant but the state doesn't try to use the testimony.
MR. WOODS:

8
9

QUESTION:

14
15
16

So, we do apply harmless error then in

examining the question?

12
13

if the state didn't use the

testimony, of course, there's no harm to the Defendant.

10

11

Well,

Just

MR. WOODS:

Well,

I believe you'd almost have to,

yes.
QUESTION:

Then, why shouldn't we apply harmless

error here?
MR. WOODS:

Well,

I have seen some decisions which

17

this Court has — there seems to be a trend towards harmless

18

error doctrine or Chapman towards these cases in which --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WOODS:

21
22
23
24
25

So, you don't object to that really?
Well, because of the trends of the Court

and the law of this land,
QUESTION:

I would say no.

And it would be your submission then that

in this case, error was not harmless?
MR. WOODS:

Exactly.

And as far as the harm to be­

ef fected, we have to, of course,

look at what a jury is going

13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

to do.

2

which we can say what a jury is going to say.

3

I think as this Court said in Cal v. Romulus,

4

California v. Romulus, that there's no objective or normative

5

marker available to say what a jury is really thinking, and if,

6

in fact, there is a harm or at least there is the error and if

7

the error is of constitutional dimensions, such as in Estelle

8

v. Smith, without the notice, then this Defendant has been

9

harmed because the jury very well could have used that

10

testimony, even though there may have been some very horrible

11

fact situations underlying the prosecution.

12

We don't know, and for that reason, we cannot really

13

peer into the minds of the jury and see exactly what they would

14

do, and it's on that basis that I believe that harm has been

15

made.

16

question about it but for the notice provision, but for the

3

availability of a defendant to have his counsel, at least to

4

talk to him prior to such examination, he may not have said

5

anything and there may not have been an examination, there may

6

not have been even testimony, and this is one thing that is

7

just so ever-presently clear.
There is continued repeated references made to the

8

9

Dallas psychiatrist and that he was a medical doctor in the

10

jury argument, and it's this basis in which the state's use of

11

this improperly-admitted evidence that the Defendant was denied

a fair trial, was denied effective assistance of counsel, and

it's on that basis,

doctrine, that harm was made.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. PALMER, ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PALMER:

20

21
22

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In disputing the harmless error finding of the Court

23

below, the briefs filed by Satterwhite and by the amicus

24

advance essentially two arguments.

25

type of error can never be harmless, and as I understand Mr.

The second argument then, and the issue for the Court

reasonable doubt.

is whether on the facts of this case, the state

Now, we have made an argument that there was no Sixth

6
7

Amendment violation in connection with Dr. Grigson's

8

examination of Satterwhite.

9

that we are wrong on that point, given the trial record before

Assuming for the sake of argument

10

this Court, any error in the admission of Dr. Grigson's

11

testimony certainly was harmless.
QUESTION:

12
13

You don't suggest that your opposition has

abandoned the notion that it was harmful?

14

MR. PALMER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PALMER:

No, Your Honor.
No.
One of the arguments made at some length

17

in the amicus brief was that this particular type of error can

18

never be harmless, and I understand that argument to be

abandoned.

abandonment?

Yes, Your Honor.
And do we have any reason to doubt that he

15

Because they believe he'll be persuasive

to the jury.

10

12

No reason to doubt it.
Then, how could we say it was harmless?

How could we possibly say it was harmless?
MR. PALMER:

Well, for a number of reasons.

First of

17

all, Dr. Grigson's testimony was not as critical to the state's

18

case on punishment as Satterwhite would have the Court believe.

19

It is true that his testimony was important in that it went to

20

an ultimate issue on punishment, one of the two special issues

21

submitted to the punishment phase of the Texas capital trial.

22
23

And doesn't the state use him because he's

QUESTION:

Wasn't he the only doctor who testified on

that issue?
MR. PALMER:

He was the only medical doctor. There

Mr. Palmer, what — where do we find the

MR. PAEiMER:

There is no court order appointing Dr.

Dr. Holbrook and I think, as Mr. Woods has stated, it was Dr.

10

There was an order entered on April 18th appointing

Grigson performing the examination instead of Dr. Holbrook.

QUESTION:

12

MR. PALMER:

Were they practicing psychiatry together?
Your Honor, I do not know, and I don't

want to represent that as a fact to the Court, but I'm under

the impression that they were.

QUESTION:

But is that ordinary practice in Texas,

3

that you expect a lawyer for a party to the case to be bound by

an order of which he had never seen a copy, that was simply put

MR. PALMER:

Again, Your Honor,

what's ordinary practice statewide.

Was the Defendant required to submit for

the examination?

11
12

I'm not aware of

MR. PALMER:

No, he was not.

If I may back up a

moment, —
QUESTION:

Well, but he did and I suppose that

counsel might have advised him not to submit.
MR. PALMER:

He might have. Our argument that counsel

16

was put on notice is really twofold; one being the fact that

17

the order was on file for two weeks prior to the examination,

18

and the second part being that prior to counsel being

19

appointed, Satterwhite had been examined by Dr. Schroeder, at

20

which time he waived his Sixth Amendment right.

21

Between the time of Dr. Schroeder's examination and

22

that of Dr. Grigson, counsel was appointed.

It strains

23

credulity to assert that Satterwhite and counsel did not

24

discuss the previous examination and any possible future

25

examinations in light of that.

MR. PALMER:

At the time counsel was appointed, there

had been one examination requested and performed.

QUESTION:

Yes, but I know, but you're saying that

the client should have told the lawyer that another examination

7

which hadn't even been requested might take place.
MR. PALMER:

8

9
10

I'm saying, Your Honor, that competent

counsel would tell his client, hey, don't let them do this to
you again.

If this happens again, don't submit.
QUESTION:

11

Well, more likely, if the counsel is told,

he would say, well, I guess that phase of it is over, they

13

aren't going to do it again.

11

MR. PALMER:

There was not a specific finding one way

12

or the other.

I think implicit in the decision of the Texas

13

Court is that assuming it was on file, it was inadequate

14

notice.

I believe that's the legal conclusion.

MR. PALMER:

Why is that implicit in the decision?
Because, as a matter of record, the

that it was filed on that date.

MR. PALMER :

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever held that?
No, Your Honor.
Has the Texas Court ever held that?
I'm not aware that they have.
So much would depend on local practice, it

seems to me, and there's really no representation or anything

11

very authoritative here about what the practice in Texas is.

MR. PALMER :

QUESTION:

14

MR. PALMER :

15

QUESTION:

16

That is true, Your Honor.
What city was this in?
San Antonio.
San Antonio.

That's a pretty big city,

isn't it?

17

MR. PALMER::

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, you usually don't run over to the

19

Clerk's office every day to see what's been filed in the cases

20

that you are involved in.

21

MR. PALMER:

Well, assuming for the sake of argument

22

that this examination was conducted in violation of

23

Satterwhite's right to counsel, we would submit that certainly

24

in this record any error was harmless.

25

QUESTION:

Do you know whether or not we possibly got
24

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

a copy of that order of April 18th?

2

MR. PALMER:

3

QUESTION:

The record is silent on that.
Well, we do know that Dr. Grigson must

4

have because on May 8th, he wrote a letter to the Judge

5

reporting on the results of his examination.

6

MR. PALMER:

7

QUESTION:

This is true.
Does the record tell us whether a copy of

8

Dr. Grigson's letter to the Judge went to the Defendant or his

counsel?

10

MR. PALMER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PALMER:

I don't know that it does, Your Honor.
I couldn't find any indication of it.
But, again, the letter was placed in the

1

arrested for carrying a concealed weapon which he attempted to

2

pull from his waist band and use it on a policeman who accosted

3

him.

4

In the face of all of this very damaging testimony,

5

Satterwhite presented no evidence whatsoever, no psychiatric

6

testimony, a reputation evidence, nothing.

7

It's -- as I said, the punishment hearing lasted five

8

and a half hours, and we really can't tell from the record how

9

long Dr. Grigson was on the stand, but it was certainly not the

10
11

bulk of that time or anything approaching it.
Now, as far as how the prosecutor relied on the

12

testimony, again the record doesn't show how much time elapsed

13

during the final argument on punishment, but it does show in

14

the printed statement of facts of the trial that the

15

prosecutor's argument occupied 291 lines of argument, nine of

16

those were devoted to Dr. Grigson.

17
18
19
20

I would submit to the Court that that is not heavy
reliance on Dr. Grigson's testimony.
Unless the Court is prepared to say that this type —
well, perhaps I should back up a moment. Only last term in

21

Buchananv. Kentucky, the Court stated that this type of error

22

can be harmless.

23

24

there was error in the admission of psychiatric testimony.

In Buchanan, the defendant claimed that he

628-4888

The

1

violation and then also stated, however, even If there had

2

been, it would be harmless.
So, I think there's no substance whatsoever to

3
4

Satterwhite's argument that this particular type of error

5

cannot be harmless.
That being so, I would submit to the Court that

6

7

certainly on this record, it was harmless beyond a reasonable

8

doubt.

9

the issues on punishment and when the defendant puts on no

When the state puts on overwhelming evidence to support

10

evidence whatsoever, and when the complained-of testimony is

11

essentially the same as that of properly-admitted testimony, it

12

would seem that any error was harmless beyond any doubt

13

whatsoever.
Satterwhite has chosen to focus on the fact that Dr.

14
15

Grigson testified on a critical issue and from that argues that

16

this can never be harmless. However, the admission of a

17

confession taken in violation of Miranda can be harmless.

18

Certainly, Dr. Grigson's testimony on punishment is no more

19

damaging to the defendant than his own words inculpating

20

himself.

21

If that sort of error could be harmless, we submit to

22

the Court that this can, too, and that on this record, it

23

certainly was.

Mr. Palmer, this

Grigson, though, was the -- am I correct that it was the only

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. WOODS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. WOODS:

I'll be short.

Your Honor, just in response, the representations I
made are accurate. It's one of these things that I don't think
in a city the size of San Antonio, about the tenth largest in
the nation here, that the counsel here can be charged with the
responsibility of going each and every day to check the Court's
jackets, and also with regard to this practice, local practice,
in Texas or specifically San Antonio, usually motions are
noticed to opposing counsel, and very rarely have I seen
otherwise, and I believe that the Court can take the same
posture.

Well, now, does this ordinarily require a

Does the state ordinarily make a motion to the judge
