We'll hear for argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The question presented in this case is whether the

12

free exercise clause bars the Government from constructing a

13

road on government land in a national forest and from

14

harvesting timber in that forest.

15

The site of these proposed Government actions is the

16

northern part of the Six Rivers National Forest, which is

17

located in Northern California.

18

It is important to note at the outset that this land

19

was never contained within an Indian reservation, is not the

20

subject of Indian treaty, and is not otherwise impressed with

21

any Indian trust obligation.

22

23
24
25

Let me begin by briefly discussing the history of the
Forest Service's decision to construct the road.
Since at least the 1930s, a series of unpaved roads
through Six Rivers National Forest has linked the California
3
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

towns of Gasquet and Orleans.

2

the 1960s that an improved road network was necessary both for

3

its timber harvesting program and for other purposes, and it

4

embarked upon a plan to construct a paved road linking the two

5

towns.

6

The Forest Service concluded in

Two separate segments of the road totalling forty-

7

nine miles have now been completed.

8

construction of a six-mile paved segment that will link up the

9

two completed segments and complete the road.

10

All that remains is the

In 1977, Forest Service issued a draft environmental

11

impact statement discussing alternative proposals for the

12

construction of the remaining segment of the road.

13

comments received by the Forest Service indicated that the afea

14

had religious significance for several Indian tribes.

15

The

The Forest Service accordingly deferred its decision

16

on whether or not to construct the road and commissioned a

17

comprehensive ethnographic study of the Indian cultural and

18

religious sites that were located in the area.

19

report, prepared at the Forest Service's direction, revealed

20

that a portion of the Six Rivers National Forest is known to

21

the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa Indian tribes as the "high country"

22

and that many of these tribes' religious beliefs and rituals

23

focus upon that area.

The 423-page

24

Journeys to the high country are an important part of

25

the Indians' religious practices, and these journeys frequently

include the performance of rituals at specific sites in the

2

high country.

3

The report stated that a successful spiritual —

Within it are sites used by the Indians

for their practices?
MR. PINCUS:

Your Honor, it's not clear from the

10

record, I don't think, whether specific sites — I don't think

11

that the report purported to document every exact site where a

12

ritual is performed.

13

For example, part of the ritual is the way one acts

14

when — at any time one is in the high country. So, I think

15

from the Indians' point of view, it is leading to distinguish

16

between the sites at which actual rituals are performed and the

17

other sites, because I think from their point of view, the

18

entire area is sacred.

19

I don't think that any of the sites, at least the

20

principal sites, of greatest spiritual significance, those are

21

hot located where the road would be built.

22

away from the road.

23

QUESTION:

Those are located

No, but if actually the site included the

24

site of the six-mile road, that might have a bearing, might it

25

not, on the extent of the burden on their free exercise rights?
5

1

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, as I said, from the

2

Indians' point of view, I don't think they would distinguish in

3

any way between the site.

4

sites where rituals are performed are not — the road is not

5

going to go over those particular sites.

6

I think, as a matter of fact, the

The report stated that a successful spiritual use of

7

the high country is dependent upon and facilitated by certain

8

qualities of the physical environment.

9

which are privacy, silence and an undisturbed natural setting.

10

The most important of

The Forest Service consultants concluded that

11

construction of the road would eliminate the required natural

12

conditions and would, therefore, seriously damage the Indians'

13

religious beliefs.

14

That's why, in further answer to your question,

15

Justice Brennan, the Indians, if they are on a site where they

16

are conducting a ritual, the fact that another part of the high

17

country has been disturbed or changed from its natural state is

18

as much of a burden as if that actual site that they were

19

standing on had been disturbed.

20

distinction.

21

So, they just don't make a

After considering the consultants' report, the Forest

22

Service announced its decision regarding the construction of

23

the road. The Service found that the completion of the road was

24

very significant to the development of timber and recreational

25

resources in the area and that the road would enhance the
6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

efficiency of administrative services, such as fire control.
At the same time, the Forest Service recognized the

2
3

importance of the Indians' religious interests in the area.

4

reconciled these two opposing interests by determining to go

5

ahead with the construction of the road, but to do so in a

6

manner that minimized the intrusion upon the Indians' religious

7

interests.

8

9

It

The Service emphasized that construction of the road
would not deprive any believer of access to the sacred area,

10

and it adopted the route alternative that was located farthest

11

away from significant spiritual sites.

12

Finally, it specified mitigation measures in

13

connection with the design of the road that would reduce the

14

audio and visual impact of the road on the surrounding area.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, can I ask one factual question

I was a little unclear on?
There is now an unpaved segment that joins the two

18

roads, is that right?

19

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it's the remaining unpaved segment

20

that was left from the original when the entire road was

21

unpaved, yes.

22

QUESTION:

But is it possible today to drive from one

23

— from the point of origin to the point of destination by just

24

going over six or seven miles of unpaved road?

25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it's not because Congress
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

designated after the District Court proceedings in this case,

2

Congress designated a large segment of this area as a

3

wilderness, and what the wilderness designation does is to

4

close the area to traffic, and the site of the paved road was

5

preempted from the wilderness designation.

6
7

The site of the unpaved road is included in the
wilderness designation.

So, it can't be used anymore.

8

QUESTION:

I see.

9

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

10
11

Do you mean if it's

paved, then it isn't part of the wilderness designation?
MR. PINCUS:

No.

Congress specifically exempted,

12

drew the boundaries of the wilderness designation so as to

13

permit the construction of the road.

14

boundaries so that they did not include the site that the

15

Forest Service had designated for the road.

It drew the wilderness

16

So, Congress made the decision.

17

QUESTION:

18

Well, then, why couldn't a car drive today

over the unpaved portion?

19

MR. PINCUS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PINCUS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PINCUS:

Well, the paved road —
That's on a different location?
It's on a different site.
I see.
The route alternative that the Forest

24

Service selected was actually farther away from the specific

25

spiritual sites than the unpaved road was, and, so, it's a
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

different site in that the site of the unpaved road is in the

2

wilderness designation.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Pincus, while you're interrupted, I

4

think the courts below held that the Government had failed to

5

comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean

6

Water Act.

7

MR. PINCUS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, they did.
Now, what about that?

I suppose you

didn't appeal on that?
MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor. We only sought review of

11

the constitutional determination. What the courts did below put

12

us in a little bit of a pickle.

13

We did not believe that the adverse rulings on the

14

NEPA and the Clean Water Act questions warranted review by this

15

Court, and we believed that we could comply with those rulings.

16

In fact, we don't intend to challenge them.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Are proceedings going forward to comply

with those two acts?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, the Forest Service internally is

20

working to revise its plans to comply.

21

public proceedings have taken place pending this Court's

22

decision on the case.

23

QUESTION:

I don't think any

And how is it that the courts below dealt

24

with the constitutional issue in view of the fact that they had

25

these statutory ones to rely on?
9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. PINCUS:

1

Well, Your Honor, I can't speak for them

2

as to why they went ahead to reach — actually, the way they

3

wrote their opinions —
QUESTION:

4
5

So, dp you think we should reach the

constitutional issue, Mr. Pincus?
MR. PINCUS:

6

Well, Your Honor, we think, as we said

7

in our certiorari petition, we believe that we can comply and

8

we have'every intention of complying with the rulings on the

9

statutory grounds and that, really, the only —
QUESTION:

10

Well, should we just vacate the opinion

11

and judgment below and say you've done enough when you decided

12

the statutory issue?
MR. PINCUS:

13

Well, Your Honor, that is one option for

14

the Court.

15

petition, we suggest it as an alternative to granting plenary

16

reviews. The Court might want to take that step and let the

17

lower courts reinstate their constitutional rulings after

18

compliance was shown.

19

We think since the issue — in our certiorari

We think now that the issue has been briefed, it

20

would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to go ahead and

21

decide it, and as I say, we think there is still a lot of

22

controversy because the Government has every intention of

23

complying with those rulings and believes it can comply, and

24

that the only obstacle to completion of the road is, in fact,

25

the injunction on constitutional grounds.
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Let me just turn to the proceedings in the District

1

2

Court and specifically the District Court's findings with

3

respect to the free exercise issue.

4

What the District Court found, and this finding is at

5

pages 64-A and 65-A of the appendix to the certiorari petition,

6

was as follows:

7

possible in the high country because of the pristine

8

environment and opportunity for solitude found there.

9

Construction of the Chimney Rock section of the road and/or the

communication with the Great Creator is

10

harvesting of timber in the high country, including clear

11

cutting, would seriously damage the salient visual, oral and

12

environmental qualities of the high country.

13

And in that effect, the Court concluded, was the

14

burden on the free exercise of religion that implicated the

15

guarantee in the First Amendment.

16

QUESTION:

17

though.

18

didn't it?

That timber cutting can no longer occur,

The wilderness designation made that impossible,

19

MR. PINCUS:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, to a large —
When did that occur?

That occurred after

21

the District Court decision, but before what?

22

it? Before the Court got it?

23

MR. PINCUS:

Before we got

There are two administrative decisions

24

before the Court, the road decision and then the separate

25

decision to adopt the management plan that provided for cutting
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

in this area of a forest.

1
2

After the District Court rendered its decision,

3

Congress passed the statute that designated the area as

4

wilderness and that really covers the great bulk of the area

5

that the Court set aside under the First Amendment.

6

practical matter, that issue is gone.
QUESTION:

7

Well, maybe the District Court wouldn't

have found the way it did concerning the degree of interference

8
!

9

So, as a

\

■.

with the Indians' religious observance had it known that there

10

was not going to be substantial logging operations in this

11

area.

12
13

Is it clear that it would have found that without the
timber?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, I think what the

15

District Court said, really, was that anything that changed the

16

area from its natural pristine state was an interference with

17

the Indians'

religious beliefs.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PINCUS:

20

Surely not.
It didn't indicate that there was any

cumulative effect.

21

QUESTION:

Well, you know,

I think the timber — I

22

think logging is a lot more intrusive than just a road, and I

23

wonder whether the District Court would have reached the same

24

result,

25

just the one and not the both.
MR. PINCUS:

You're not sure.

It's possible. Certainly one option for
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

this Court would be to vacate the decisions below and to remand

2

them to let the District Court reconsider its decision, but I

3

think that the tenor of the opinion of the District Court and

4

of the Court of Appeals, which, of course, was decided after

5

the wilderness designation, and took account of the wilderness

6

designation, is that the wilderness designation didn't make any

7

difference.

8

The Court of Appeals, in fact, specifically said in

9

its opinion that it recognized that logging would become much

10

less significant because of the wilderness designation on page

11

9-A of the appendix to the certiorari petition, but it

12

indicated that that did not alter its conclusion that the

13

adverse impact from construction of the road was sufficient to

14

constitute a burden on free exercise rights.

15
16

I guess that discussion is at 9-A and 10-A of the
opinion.
QUESTION:

17

It's also true, just noticing on page 8-A,

18

that they talk about the activity of the logging and all as

19

part of what is destructive, the very core of the Indian

20

practices.

21
22

23

MR. PINCUS:

Yeah.

The 8-A is a quote.

That is a

quote of the District Court's finding.
QUESTION:

Correct. And they agreed with that finding

24

as the basis for their analysis.

25

the logging out, you both lessen the impact on the Indians and

It seems to me if you take

13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

you lessen the Government justification.

2

helps both sides or hurts both sides, but it's a different case

3

without logging than it is with logging.
MR. PINCUS:

4

I mean, it kind of

Well, Your Honor, as I say, the Court is

5

certainly free to remand it.

6

the opinions below really was that any interference, the road

7

alone was enough, but that the Court —
QUESTION:

8

9

I think that really the basis of

Let me just ask this then.

Before the

designation of the wilderness area, had an unpaved road that

10

went through here, was there traffic on that road from time to

11

time?

12

MR. PINCUS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

There was.

So that if you have nothing but a road and

14

no logging, you've had it in an unpaved pasture and apparently

15

the Indian religion survived that, and the only difference,

16

according to your view, I guess, is you changed it from unpaved

17

to paved.

18
19

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I don't want to speak for the

Indian Respondent, but I'm sure they can speak to that.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PINCUS:

No.
The record indicates that part of the

22

burden was at least that the paved — the actual physical

23

changing of the landscape by paving, by having a paved road

24

there, and the increase in traffic, if the Court wants to

25

remand for reconsideration to the District Court, that's
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

certainly an option, although, as I say, the Court of Appeals

2

— the wilderness designation happened before the Court of

3

Appeals issued its decision and it, with that fact before it,

4

upheld the determination that there was a burden on free

5

exercise rights.

6

Let me turn now to the constitutional —

MR. PINCUS:

Other Court of Appeals decisions on the

QUESTION:
MR. PINCUS:

12

The- —
Well, Your Honor, we think that the

3

Courts of Appeals really are in a bit of a disarray as to

4

exactly what the right legal approach is when confronted with

15

these questions.

Some courts have held that an injunction in

6

favor of the Indian religious claim would constitute an

7

establishment of religion.

8

that looks to whether the particular religious site -- well,

9

no, Your Honor, this is the only Court that has ever — the

Other courts have applied a test

20

only Court of Appeals that has ever come out in favor of the

21

Indians.

22

The threshold question on the constitutional issue

23

presented in this case is whether the construction of the road

24

and the adoption of the management plan impose a burden on the

25

Indians' rights that calls the free exercise clause into play,
5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and viewed from the Indians' perspective, these government

2

actions obviously have an adverse effect on religious

3

interests.

4

They eliminate the conditions necessary for effective

5

spiritual use of an area that is very important to the Indians'

6

religion, but the free exercise clause is not implicated

7

whenever the Government acts in a manner that offends an

8

individual's religious beliefs.

9
0

A believer's conclusion that government action
impacts adversely upon his belief system is not by itself

11

sufficient to trigger constitutional protection, and that was

12

really the holding of this Court joined by eight members in

3
4

Bowen v. Roy.
The Plaintiffs in Roy challenged the Government's use

5

of the social security number to identify their daughter and

6

they asserted that the use of that number would rob their

7

daughter of her spirit and prevent her from attaining greater

8

spiritual power, and despite the undisputed assertion that the

9

Government's use of the number would cause severe spiritual

20

harm to the Plaintiffs, the Court found no burden on free

21

exercise rights.

22

We think that Roy makes clear that it's necessary to

23

look beyond the believer's subjective assessment of the effect

24

of government action.

25

infringe upon the constitutional rights, even if they have a

Some types of government actions do not

QUESTION:

Is it your position, Mr. Pincus, that the

3

Government need not make any concessions whatever to the

4

interests of the Indians in this case?

5

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor. It is our position that

6

under the Constitution, because the Constitution does not

7

require the Government to do anything, we think that it's

8

certainly appropriate to do exactly what the Forest Service did

9

in this case, which is to consider those interests heavily, to

10

investigate them fully, and to take account of them to the

11

greatest extent possible, consistent with the statutory

12

framework that Congress has set up, and that's precisely what

13

Congress mandated when it enacted the American Indian Religious

14

Freedom Act.

15

What Congress specifically did not do and expressly

16

did not do was to create an additional substantive right for

17

Indian religious claims of this sort, and we think that the

18

Constitution doesn't do that either.

19

Now, so, in addition to the believer's claim that

20

there is subjectively — that he finds interference with his

21

belief system, there has to be an objective element to the

22

government action. It has to satisfy an objective test and we

23

think that the Court's decision in Bowen v. Roy sets forth what

24

that objective test is.

25

In concluding that the Government's use of the social
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

security number did not implicate the free exercise clause, the

2

Court said that the clause had not been interpreted to require

3

the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual

4

believes will further his or her spiritual development, and the

5

Court also observed that the clause is written in terms of what

6

the individual cannot do — whait the Government cannot do to

7

the individual, not in terms of what the individual can expect

8

from the Government.
QUESTION:

9

That sounds good, but what do you do about

10

Sherbert, Thomas and Hobbie, all of which said that the

11

Government cannot use its money in a way that impinges upon an

12

individual's religious beliefs. So, you have to make welfare

13

benefits available to people who don't want to work on Saturday

14

or whatever.
Why is it any different when you're talking about not

15
16

the Government's money but the Government's land?

17

constitutional line between money and land?
MR. PINCUS:

18

Is that the

I don't think that's the line, Justice

19

Scalia.

20

Government did was put an objective burden on the individual's

21

choice about what course of conduct he or she was going to

22

pursue.

23

I think the line is that in those cases, what the

The Government put a monetary price over choosing one

24

alternative or the other, and that is an objective indicia of

coercion, and that's exactly what the Court said in those

We think that's a very, very important line to draw

8

in the religion context because in the religion clauses — let

9

me start differently.

10

Most of the protections of the Constitution, such as

11

the free speech clause or the Fourth Amendment, protect

12

objectively-identified interests.

13

decide what is speech and it can decide what reasonable

14

expectations of privacy are protected under the Fourth

15

Amendment, but the Court cannot decide what religion is because

16

the Constitution leaves that to each individual to decide for

17

himself or herself.

18

What is — this Court can

The problem that is really posed by the free exercise

19

clause is how the clause can be applied without sweeping every

20

kind of government action under its umbrella because an

21

individual is free to attach religious significance to anything

22

the Government does or anything the Government fails to do,

23

and, so, if there's no objective limit on what the clause

24

covers, everything can be converted into a free exercise claim

25

just by the individual believing very sincerely that that
19

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

action that the Government has taken infringes upon his or her

2

religious beliefs.

3

We think that's why it's especially important in this

4

context to make clear that there's an additional objective

5

standard that the government actions have to be measured

6

against before the

7

triggered, and that objective standard, I think, is the

8

distinction that the Court was driving at in Roy.

9

free exercise clagse protections are

It's the distinction between government interference

10

with individual conduct on one hand and individual control of

11

government action on the other, and, really, what the clause

12

does is shield the individual and his person and his property

13

against government reaching in and coercively affecting his

14

individual decisions about how to order his life and to order

15

his property, and when the Government does that, either

16

directly with regulation or indirectly by conditioning

17

government benefits in a way that has the effect of regulation,

18

then there's a free exercise violation.

19

But if the Government doesn't do that, if it doesn't

20

say anything about what the individual should do or what the

21

individual shouldn't do with his property or just does

22

something with its own property, we don't think that that's a

23

free exercise burden that calls the Constitution into play.

Let me just briefly say that the contrary conclusion,
acceptance of Respondent's contention, would just work in

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to show

how long the Indians have been using this land?
MR. PINCUS:

There is testimony in the record

15

indicating the use is quite — has been quite long, but, Your

16

Honor, I think, --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PINCUS:

19

goes back that long, Your Honor.

20

goes back to the 1800s.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PINCUS:

Weren't they using it before we arrived?
I don't think that the record evidence
I'm not sure. It certainly

It could be so, couldn't it?
It certainly could be, but let me say

23

that any rule that makes the protections of the free exercise

24

clause depends on how long a religion has been in existence is

25

the very type of government preference for religion really that
21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the clause is specifically designed to prevent.
It would elevate a traditional religion over a new

2
3

religion and give it more protection against government action.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Pincus, how does your theory apply to

5

this situation?

Suppose the Court retained federal ownership

6

in whole quantities of land which it allows people to settle on

7

but it retains title, and it simply adopts a rule that no

8

places of worship may be built on this federal land.
Now, that's just the Federal Government's use of its

9
10

own land.

11

another.

It's not coercing anybody to do one thing or
Do you think that would be constitutional?

12

MR. PINCUS:

13

QUESTION:

In your hypothetical, -Let's assume the whole state of Nevada

14

were still federally owned and that the Federal Government just

15

says we just don't want any churches. Churches or other places

16

of worship.

17

MR. PINCUS:

Well, but. Your Honor, in your

18

hypothetical, if there were people living on the land -- I

19

assume that what would happen is there would be tenancies and

20

people would have a lease and the lease would say you can't

21

build — I think that's a very different case because those are

22

people with rights in the particular land.

23

that's limited, but I think that that limitation might be

24

subject to constitutional scrutiny.

25

It may be a right

But it's a very different case, I think, where there
22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

are people who have absolutely no right in the land, and that's

2

what we are talking about here.
QUESTION:

3

So, you are limiting your principles.

4

It's not the Government can do anything with its land; the

5

Government can do anything with its land so long as it doesn't

6

give individuals rights in the land?
MR. PINCUS:

7

Well, no, Your Honor, I am not limiting

8

my principle because my principle is again this protection of

9

an individual and his own resources, and part of those

10

resources would include the property rights that he has by

11

virtue of his agreement with the Government.
QUESTION:

12

Wouldn't Widmark v. Vincent and that line

13

of cases prevent the Government from saying that we'll allow

14

any sort of building to be built on these leased lands except a

15

church?

16

MR. PINCUS:

I think you're right, Your Honor.

17

That's probably the more logical way to take care of that

18

problem, that there would be a discrimination against religion.

19

Anyway, just to conclude, I think what's important to

20

note is that this is not — the claim that's asserted here is

21

not a claim that can constitutionally be limited to traditional

22

Indian religions.

23

available to anyone.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court
While I will be addressing two specific points this
25

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

morning, I would first like to clarify some of the factual

2

discussion that preceded my presentation.

3

I think it's first important to realize that it is

4

one site in regards to whether or not the government action is

5

actually occurring on the site.

6

shows is used in a general sense.

7

People progress from one focal point to another, but it is not

8

like different pews in a church. It's one area and you go from,

9

for example, from Chimney Rock, you have to travel to the other

10

area, and it isn't that they're independent and you can say you

11

didn't destroy this pew and you didn't destroy this one.

12

It's one site that the record
Different trails are used.

I think It's clear to understand that the record

13

establishes one area, one generalized use, and a particular

14

pattern of religious conduct that requires a progression —

15

QUESTION:

Does the record show, Ms. Miles, how many

16

square miles or square feet there are involved or how long a

17

trail in miles or yards of progression would be?

18

MS. MILES:

The Court — yeah.

I think the record

19

does, Your Honor, yes.

20

to what constitutes this one area, and admittedly it's a large

21

area in this particular instance, principally because

22

geographically —

23

QUESTION:

In terms of evidence was established as

May I ask, Ms. Miles?

Are you suggesting

24

that if the intrusion is limited only to a mile, nevertheless,

25

since the area is twenty-five miles, it's an intrusion against
26

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

the whole?
MS. MILES:

What I am suggesting is that you have to

3

look at where the government action is occurring and what

4

conduct is it impacting.

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, now, it's occurring, I gather, only

at the six-mile strip, isn't it?

7

MS. MILES:

8

QUESTION:

9

or twenty-five miles, is it?

10

Right.
But that's an invasion of the whole site

MS. MILES:

Not necessarily.

11

sacredness, yes.

12

what they believe, but what we're proposing here is not that

13

that's the test at all or the idea that it's disturbing the

14

sacredness, but you've got the road going between particular

15

sites where religious activity has to go through.

16

Yes.

Having it occurred —-

That bothers and seriously goes against

So, you have to look at where the conduct is

17

occurring and where the government action is occurring,

18

although any intrusion in there does offend them, but that's

19

not the position, that's not what the court below held in terms

20

of what you look at. You look at the serious impact that the

21

activity will have on the conduct.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what' is the area again?

Is it in

square miles or linear miles or linear feet?
MS. MILES:

Yeah.

I think it boils down to around --

well, about 13,500 was put into the district and 17,000 is

It's the acreage that comes from the fact that you have

national district because it is so different than —
QUESTION:

11

Well, Ms. Miles, would your clients take

12

the position that any use that might interfere with the

13

religious practices of your clients would mandate the kind of

constitutional view that you are urging?

15

proceedings by Forest Service rangers in connection with fire

16

protection or a Boy Scout encampment or the uses by other

17

people of the forest area.

MS. MILES:

For example,

No, Your Honor, and that claim has never

been made in this case.
QUESTION:

20

Well, wouldn't that burden the religious

21

practices in the same way, by creating noise and disturbance

22

and —
MS. MILES:

Certainly not to the degree that the road

does.

It would be a burden?
It would to some degree, Your Honor.

But

4

we are not claiming. That is not a request for the relief here,

5

and —

6

QUESTION:

But I suppose the claim could be made in

7

the future, that any use, including that by other non-Indians,

8

of the Forest Service land would constitute a sufficient burden

9

that it must be prohibited?

10

MS. MILES:

We don't believe that if you adopt- the

11

test that is used by the 9th Circuit and the D.C. Circuit and

12

the 6th Circuit that that would necessarily establish a claim.

13

It is a very narrow one.

If —
Your clients might make that kind of —
-- you could show that there was serious

interference of the nature that is shown in this case, and I

19

don't think that necessarily you could in the facts that you

20

propose, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Would you help me with one other factor?

22

We've got the logging out of the case now, but what about the

23

situation that existed when they hit an unpaved road? Was

What?

There will be no logging trucks on the

paved road in the future, will there?
MS. MILES:
because the

Well, certainly not to the extent perhaps

wilderness bill has affected that, but the —

QUESTION:

How do

we know that there will be any more

15

traffic on the paved road than there was on the unpaved road,

16

and if it didn't harm the religion sufficiently when it was

17

unpaved, why, without any logging in the case, why is there

18

such a big difference?

19

MS. MILES:

Well, I don't think that the assumption

20

is correct that this road by itself, which will have some

21

traffic or else I don't know why the Forest Service would be

22

planning to

build this road if it wasn't going to be used by

23

anybody, it

seems to be not much of a purpose, but what I would

24

like to explain is what I tried to clarify before, that you've

25

got practitioners, religious practitioners, under the tenets of
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

their religion traveling from the Doctor Rock area and if you

2

understand the particular types of activities that they

3

undertake, it's getting into trance-like states.

4

conduct that's different than most practices, and they have to

5

journey across to Chimney Rock, which is up above on the other

6

side of the road.

7

It's a

Just having the road there will take them out of

8

being able to have that practice.

When you come across the

9

road and it just is a physical interference and you have to

10

stop and look to see if there are trucks coming right now or it

11

just physically interferes with their ability to continue what

12

has been going on for hundreds of years in that area.

13
14

QUESTION:

and look before they cross?

15

MS. MILES:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Didn't they have to cross the unpaved road

The unpaved road, Your Honor, —
It seems to me that the difference is in

the amount of traffic.
MS. MILES:

The amount of traffic partly, is partly

19

it. The other thing would come into the belief system with

20

regards to the fact that the road is a natural road.

21

dirt road that is very rarely used and it's just part of that

22

natural environment.

23

It is totally different than a road —

It is a

MS. MILES:

It used to be a trail, an Indian trail.
It had to be substantially graded, I would

4

think, to make it a jeep trail.

MS. MILES:

6
7

It has been somewhat improved, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Ms. Miles, suppose the Federal Government

8

were to set aside a whole tract of federal land, say this land

9

is dedicated to the use of the Mormons and no one shall make

10

any use of this land that would offend Mormon beliefs, would

11

that be constitutional?

12
13

MS. MILES:

I think that would be inappropriate, but

what I think you're —

14

QUESTION:

15

Would it be unconstitutional?

16

MS. MILES:

I didn't ask would it be inappropriate.

It would run most likely afoul of the

17

establishment clause, but what I'd like to clarify, there is no

18

set-aside in this area.

19

Government is attempting to say that there's some kind of one

20

use only by the Indian people and that is not true.

21
22

This is not a set-aside.

non-Indian Plaintiffs who use the area.

MS. MILES:

at what you're doing, you have to show factually that the

isn't a set-aside.

MS. MILES:

And what about — is that a greater burden

than the use of the road?

MS. MILES:

people don't go to much.

because it's an area that it just a remote rugged area that

people do not utilize on the way that we would think of

recreationally.
So, in that area, once in awhile, there will be

people and that would have some interference, but it is not of

the impact of what the Government proposes in this case.

But you said that potentially it could be

certainly could constitute a burden, depending upon the nature

and extent of the use by non-Indians of that property.

So, you say that the Government must keep

No, that's not true, Your Honor.
Would you mind if loggers came in there?
And cut the trees down as proposed?
Yes.
We say that that would interfere with the

conduct of religious practices occurring there.
QUESTION:

Well, that certainly is a substantial

18

restriction in favor of religion on what the Government can do

19

with its property.

20

MS. MILES:

The Government — we are asking the

21

Government itself not to.take an act that will take away from

22

these people a religious practice that has been occurring.

23

QUESTION:

Well, the act that you're talking about is

24

whether loggers can come in.

So, this twenty-five miles is

MS. MILES:

No, that's not true, Your Honor.

If you

take a look at the management plan, what you're talking about

is not all of that area was going to be logged.

QUESTION:

MS. MILES:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, why isn't that reserving — why

isn't that excluding loggers from twenty-five square miles?
MS. MILES:

10

11

Well, wouldn't you have the same objection

to logging going on in any part of the twenty-five miles?

7

9

That area is a

It is excluding the Government from

undertaking certain types of activities in that area.
QUESTION:

12

Well, you say that the free exercise

3

clause forbids the Government permitting loggers to come in to

4

that area.

5

MS. MILES:

We say that the free exercise clause,

6

when you show it in an area, the only place that you could

7

practice your religion under the tenets of your religion, —

8
9
20
2

QUESTION:

So, you're saying yes, that twenty-five

miles is sealed off from loggers because the area is central to
the practice of religious beliefs.
MS. MILES:

And that the Government's act — it would

22

be spread out to other — it is not that it is aimed at

23

loggers, that the government action that is proposed when you

24

show that it's going to seriously impact the physical ability

25

to carry on your practice, we submit the Government cannot do
36

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that to these people.
QUESTION:

2

I suppose if the Government decided to

3

improve some back-packing trails or build some overnight cabins

4

in that high country, you would have the same problem?
MS. MILES:

5
6

That may not be.the

serious interference that the court found below.

7

Your Honor,

8

QUESTION:

9

Not necessarily.

I'd like to address —
But if it were,

think the same result should be.

I take it that you would

If the Indians said the

10

building of these overnight cabins also offends our traditional

11

religion, you would think the results should be the same.

12

MS. MILES:

Your Honor, not that it offends them.

If

13

we could demonstrate to the Court that whatever that government

14

activity is, seriously interferes with the ability to conduct

15

the practice — this is not just a belief case. While belief is

16

part of it, you can't separate out. It's physical interference

17

with the ability to conduct practices in an area where they

18

have been conducting them long before the Federal Government

19

even came into existence.
QUESTION:

20

21

non-Indians?

22

deer?

How about hunting by

Is that area open in some hunting seasons to hunt

23

MS. MILES:

24

QUESTION:

25

What about hunting?

Yes, it is. Your Honor.
And I suppose that might that not

seriously disturb Indian religious practices?
37

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

MS. MILES:
that —
QUESTION:

3
4

That would be a factual determination

Well,

if it were, then you would say the

Government must prevent hunters from entering that area.

5

MS. MILES:

I think what we're saying is when the

6

Government is undertaking its action, that it's taking away

7

from the ability to exercise your religion. That is different

8

than when you are affirmatively asking them to do something.

9

It may be a slight distinction, but we're asking that the

10

Government itself —

11

QUESTION:

12

it would be okay.

13

that it?

If they let somebody else build the road,
It's only that they're building the road,

14

MS. MILES:

15

QUESTION:

is

No, that's not true, Your Honor.
What about motorcycles and jeeps in that

16

area?

17

could get into that place?

Do you object to any kind of vehicular traffic that

18

MS. MILES:

Again,

if, under a factual showing, you

19

showed that that seriously interfered with the practice, then

20

the problem is there may be no remedy for some of that because

21

you would then be affirmatively asking for the Government to

22

take action. We're not. We're saying in this very limited

23

circumstance, do not take action that takes away from the

24

Indians.

25

QUESTION:

How about organized camping trips into the
38

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

high country, with horses and tents, where packers bring in

2

large numbers of people?
MS. MILES:

3

Again, I think there would be — there

4

may be a burden but no remedy for the Indian people when it

5

comes to doing affirmative — requesting that type of

6

affirmative relief.

7

Your Honor, — excuse me?

8

“QUESTION:

9

Don't you think that the opinion of the

Court in Bowen v. Roy addresses itself rather specifically to

10

your free exercise claim here?

11

MS. MILES:

Not at all, Your Honor, and that was my

12

first point.

13

Roy, you have here government action directly reaching out

14

where a religious conduct is occurring, and the only place that

15

it can —

16

That this case is not Bowen v. Roy, that unlike

QUESTION:

Well, the Roy opinion says that the First

17

Amendment does not require the Government itself to behave in

18

ways the individual believes will further his or her spiritual

19

development.

20

MS. MILES:

And I don't quarrel with that.

This is

21

not just of that belief.

22

action that interferes with the actual practice, conduct.

23

QUESTION:

You've got the Government taking

Well, I think that is rather the

24

implication of that language in Bowen v. Roy, and I just wonder

25

how you get around that.

The thrust of it is that the
39

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Government needn't use its own property in such a way as to

2

account for the religious activities or beliefs of others.
MS. MILES:

3
4

I don't think activities was involved in

there at all, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

In Roy, certainly it was.

The Government

6

was giving this individual a social security number and

7

circulating it, you know, throughout wherever social security

8

numbers go.

That was an activity by the Government.

MS. MILES:

9
10

activity.

I'm sorry.

11

subjective thing.

No. I am speaking about the believer's
That there — in that case, you had a

12

Here, you've got actual physical conduct. There was

13

no nexus with practice in that case at all in the opinion and

14

here you've got actual conduct that is being interfered with by

15

the government act, and it's not an internal act, such as that

16

that was found in Roy, but it is an act that is occurring.

17
18
19

A road-building out on public land is not of the same
nature of act as was found in Roy.
QUESTION:

Well, if anything, the consequence

20

asserted in the Bowen v. Roy case was perhaps more severe than

21

in yours because the allegation was that the daughter had been

22

deprived and robbed of her spirit by this government activity,

23

and I would think that might even be a more serious claim.

24
25

MS. MILES:

What is happening in this case, Your

Honor, which is equally serious, is that these practices go to
40

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

the very core of the religion for a substantially-large number

2

of people, and if they cannot be conducted, if they have that

3

same type of belief, but you physically would be terminating

4

this particular religion for these people by allowing the

5

government act out in a very public way, not in any sense the

6

way it is in the Roy case.

7

Your Honor, we do admit that this case is different

8

than the other cases, but I think there has been a principled

9

way that the Court has approached free exercise cases, and that

10

is by looking in each particular case whether or not the

11

particular act that is being questioned is intended to

12

interfere or has the effect of interfering with the ability to

13

practice their religion.
QUESTION:

14

What is it that you — now that the area

15

is a designated wilderness area, what specifically does the

16

Government propose to do that you disagree with?
MS. MILES:

17
18

of the road.

MS. MILES:

Paving?
Paving this two-lane road, building that

That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And what does the Government — why does

23

the Government want to do — go forward with that now that the

24

surrounding area has been designated a wilderness area?

25

MS. MILES:

Well, I suppose you have to ask the
41

Heritage- Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Government, but my understanding is that the— although the

2

trial court made very specific findings about the interest that

3

would be advanced, was to increase some access for the area and

4
5

QUESTION:

6

MS. MILES:

7
8
9
10

Increased access to a wilderness area?
Well, it was not wilderness at the time

the road was proposed, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but if they still propose to

build it, I suppose that's what it is.
MS. MILES:

But the trial court specifically found

11

that there is all the access that one needs to get to that

12

particular area.

13

made in this case.

14

So, that was a factual finding that had been

If you adopt the position of the Government in this

15

case, it would mean that native American site-specific

16

practices, which Congress has expressly recognized in the

17

American Indian Religious Freedom Act, will receive no

18

constitutional protection when the Government is physically

19

planning an act that prevents these types of practices from

20

continuing.

21

We submit, Your Honor, that if the First Amendment

22

means anything, it means that the Government cannot take away

23

the very ability of an individual to practice his religion at

24

the only place that it can be practiced under the tenets of

25

their religion.

If, indeed, you protect all religions under
42

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the Constitution, then this type of site-specific religion is

2

entitled to protection when it is seriously threatened by

3

governmental action.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Ms. Miles, do you rely at all on the

American Indian Religious Freedom Act?
MS. MILES:

We feel that that does provide

7

substantive rights and it also provides the understanding of

8

what Congress —

9
10

QUESTION:
MS. MILES:

How does it help you?
Well, we think it's a cause of action

11

that this case could turn on, that it is a substantive right

12

that has been violated in this case.

13

14

QUESTION:

Ms. Miles, out of curiosity, how numerous

are these tribes or the Indians that practice?

15

MS. MILES:

16

QUESTION:

Excuse me?
How numerous are these tribes or how

17

numerous are the Indians that practice these rituals?

18

record show that at all?

19

MS. MILES:

Yes.

Does the

The record does show that, and

20

approximately the trial court's findings that probably a 100 to

21

a 140 people physically are undertaking the rituals on behalf

22

of a larger community of about 4500 religious adherents.

23

tribes themselves are --

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. MILES:

The

What do you mean on behalf of?
Well, much as a priest does it on behalf
43

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of the larger communities, the people that go there do it on

2

behalf of more than themselves.

3

that do this on behalf of the religious community.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

They are the spiritual leaders

They are about a 140 and the whole

community is how many?
MS. MILES:

No.

There are about a 140 that

7

physically go there and undertake these practices on behalf of

8

a larger religious community which is approximately 4500.

9
10

Now, as to the Indian people over all, if that was
your question, there's about 10,000 involved.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MILES:

You've answered the question.
Your Honor, we don't contend that the

13

right to practice the religion here is absolute, but only that

14

it is subject to the same balancing of interests that is the

15

touchstone of the First Amendment, when you have shown a

16

serious interference with the ability to practice and a threat

17

to the religion itself.

18

I would next like to talk about what the court below,

19

the specific rule that is used by the 9th Circuit, that has

20

been used also by the D.C. Circuit and the 6th Circuit, and it

21

requires that before you have a cause of action, that the

22

Respondent must show that the particular area where the

23

Government's action is going to occur is central and

24

indispensable; that is, they cannot practice this anywhere

25

else, and that the action will seriously impair the ability to
44
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

conduct these practices.
Only then is the Government required to show a

2
3

compelling state interest that can't otherwise be served.

The

4

courts specifically held that showing that the area was sacred

5

was not enough.

6

you know, believe.

That would be the Roy notion as far as we can,

Secondly, showing that the area is used for religious

7
8

purposes,

that is not enough.

You've got to show that it's the

9

only area that this can occur under the tenets of the religion

10

and that the government act will, in fact, seriously interfere

11

with the ability to conduct the practices at that area.

12

We submit that this is a proper balancing test for

13

what has been shown to be a very serious infringement on the

14

religious rights of a large number of people and would for

15

other native Americans who practice similar religions, and that

16

it sufficiently insulates the Government from claims of this

17

nature and would require only when those very unique factors

18

come together.

19

I wanted to clarify that.

It does no good to say

20

there's a thousand sites because that has no meaning

21

whatsoever.

22

being used for religious purposes,

23

occurring where the particular practice has to occur, and, so,

24

that's a scare tactic that has no meaning when you look at it

25

in terms of a factual case-by-case determination.

One has got to look at the site being used, is it
is the Government's action

45

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

History, in fact, the cases show that while the

2

courts have said that Indians do have First Amendment rights on

3

those lands, it should be respected. Factually, the claims are

4

very difficult to sustain. Not all claims, as I've noted, will

5

be found to be religious, as in Sequoyah v.TVA. There was no

6

use being made of that area.

7

to be conducted at the particular site, and, so, it would not

8

interfere with the Government's proposal at all unless you

9

could show that, and not all land projects are going to

10

seriously interfere with it, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MILES:

13

Not all religious practices have

Except indispensability tests —
We do not quarrel with that test.

We

accept that test.

QUESTION:

15

MS. MILES:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. MILES:

You do?
Yes, we do.

And we feel that the — well, to lessen

18

the protection, the constitutional protection for what are core

19

religious practices and religious freedom here would be

20

contrary to the whole notion that the Bill of Rights does

21

protect this type of practice from governmental action.

22

In conclusion, Respondent submits that the rule used

23

by the court below strikes a proper balance and that the other

24

Circuit Courts have felt rather than just throwing this

25

religion totally out on the streets, that this was one way of
46

meeting both concerns, and we feel that it is an appropriate

way that should be affirmed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

First of all, with reference to the American Indian

10

Religious Freedom Act, as we discussed in our reply brief, we.

11

don't believe that Congress created any substantive rights when

12

it passed that statute.

13

Just a few things, Your Honor.

The second point I'd like to make is about the Roy

14

case and the distinction that Roy does not apply because no

15

practice was involved there.

16

We think that that's a little bit of a red herring.

17

The only link between what the Government has done in the

18

practice here, we think, is the link that Respondents believe

19

that their practices will just not be spiritually effective

20

anymore. But I don't think that there are -- there are no

21

findings of the courts below that those practices would be’

22

physically prevented by what the Government is proposing to do.

23

And, finally, I'd like to discuss Respondent's

24

suggestion that the serious interference requirement will take

25

care of the line-drawing problems that came up in her colloquy
47

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

with the various members of the Court.
We think the problem with that test is it's really

2
3

not an objective test. If a religious believer asserts that a

4

government action has a serious interference with his beliefs

5

or with what he wants to do, then that acceptance has to be —

6

that assertion has to be accepted by the Court.
QUESTION:

7

8

The Government still wants to go ahead

with this road?
MR. PINCUS:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, we do.
Paving this road?
Yes, we do, Your Honor. The road would

12

not only serve — first of all, it does not only serve logging

13

interests, it serves maintenance interests and recreational

14

interests.

15

Second of all, it will also provide a conduit for

16

logging trucks from other parts of this forest and neighboring

17

forests to enable the logs to get to the mills. So, it still

18

has purposes, and I note that forty-nine of the fifty-five

19

miles have already been built.

20

Anyway, the serious interference test is not a real

21

limitation, and a court can't look behind what the believer

22

said, and, so, any believer can come into court and say just

23

what the hypothetical posed by Justice O'Connor, that the entry

24

of non-believers into the area offends, will make their

25

practices impossible, and the court will have to accept that
48

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

and under Respondent's theory, we submit that would be a burden

2

on the free exercise of religion that would require the

3

Government to show a compelling interest.

4

We just don't think that the free exercise clause

5

stretches that far and we think that the Court's decision in

6

Roy disposes of Respondent's claim here.,

7

QUESTION:

May I ask one question?

I gather that

8

you're going to have to prepare an environmental impact

9

statement to comply with the other part of the case.

10

11

MR. PINCUS:
, QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Will that statement contain any analysis

12

of the extent, probable extent of use of the road and how much

13

it will affect the environment?

14

Indian practices here.

15

Presumably perhaps even the

I wonder if we know enough about the facts to even

apply the test your opponent relies on.

17

to use that test.

MR. PINCUS:

You say we don't want

Well, Your Honor, as I said earlier, if

the Court —
QUESTION:

I know you say it's okay with you, but I'm

21

just wondering, to what extent may there actually be more

22

enlightenment on this issue by the things that must be done

23

before you can build the road anyway?

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, there might be

enlightenment, but it's really only — it will only be

effective if those changes will cause the Indian believers to

2

withdraw their claim because if they come into court and say

3

notwithstanding the change, these effects still burden our

4

religion, the District Court and this Court will have to accept

that claim. It can't be looked behind.
