CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll wait just a moment,

Mr. Lefstein, till the court clears.
(Pause)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Very well.

You may proceed

whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART R. LEFSTEIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an anti-trust case and a state law tortious
interference with business expectancies case that was filed in
the United States District Court in Rock Island, Illinois.
Summary judgment was granted for the Plaintiffs,
Charles Christianson, and his business, International Trade
Service.
The Defendant, Colt, then took an appeal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The
Federal Circuit, pursuant to the Plaintiffs' motion,
transferred the case to the Seventh Circuit on the ground it
did not have jurisdiction.
The Seventh Circuit, after hearing arguments on the
merits, briefing and oral arguments, sua sponte, wrote an
opinion saying it did not have jurisdiction but that, indeed,
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction.
. 3

1

QUESTION:

Do you mean the opinion was written sua

2

sponte or the holding was that it had no jurisdiction sua

3

sponte?

Courts write opinions sua sponte.

4

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Okay.

I'll accept the correction.

5

The case was then sent back to the Federal Circuit.

6

The Federal Circuit then wrote a lengthy opinion, most of which

7

dealt with the subject of jurisdiction.

H

carefully why it was right the first time, why it did not have

9

jurisdiction.

It explained very

It specifically held, as it said in its first

10

order, it had no jurisdiction pursuant to congressional

1J

enactment, and then it said, nonetheless, despite the lack of a

12

statutory grant of jurisdiction, it was going to decide the

13

merits, and in deciding the merits, it reversed the judgment

14

below that was in favor of the Plaintiff and, of course, then

15

after that, this Court granted certiorari.

1(3

The certiorari petition had actually submitted the

17

guestion of jurisdiction and the question was phrased whether

18

the United States Court of Appeals may rule on the merits of an

19

appeal when it expressly rules that it does not have subject

20

matter jurisdiction pursuant to statute.

21

That question was granted and the Court directed the

22

parties to brief and argue a second question, which it did, in

23

fact, the Federal Circuit have jurisdiction from the appeal.

24

Now, with respect to the first question, --

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Lefstein, before you get to that, what
4

Heritage Reporting Corporation

exactly do you want us to do with this?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

What we are actually asking, the

relief we're asking for at this particular time is that the
appeal be dismissed.
QUESTION:

No more than that?

MR. LEFSTEIN:
QUESTION:

That's what we're asking for.

What happens then?

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, then, it would be remanded to

the District Court for further proceedings.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't we have to say that?

Wouldn't we

have to say that?
MR. LEFSTEIN:
QUESTION:

If that was the Court's order, yes.

Because I just don't know what position

the case is in.
MR. LEFSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, the case --

We have a court that says I don't have

jurisdiction, but I decide, and I am at a loss as to what you
do with a decision like that.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, we are reguesting for reasons

that we've placed in our brief that if we are correct and that
is and if the Federal Circuit is correct, that it did not have
jurisdiction, that, therefore, the remedy is dismissal, and
we've said that actually for a couple of reasons, and one of
the reasons is that Colt did not cross petition and, therefore,
they're not entitled under prior holdings of this Court, which
5
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

we've cited,

o

the remedy of transfer pursuant to Section 1631 may only be

to obtain the remedy of transfer and, of course,

granted if it is in the interest of justice.
4

We've cited reasons why we believe it is not in the

r

interest of justice to bring about a transfer, and that is

6

because we believe that Colt,

7

jurisdictional question, which was presented to both courts,

0

and even in its brief to the Seventh Circuit, made statements

9

in it which we believe actually misled the Seventh Circuit into

in its briefing on the

10

coming to the conclusion that the Federal Circuit and not the

1 l

Seventh Circuit had jurisdiction.

12

QUESTION:

What if we decide that the Court of

13

Appeals shouldn't have decided the merits?

14

just remand the case to them?

13

MR.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR- LEFSTEIN:

LEFSTEIN:

To the Court of Appeals?

Yes.
Well, you might remand it to the Court

of Appeals,

but I assume that you would then have to give

QUESTION:

Well,

I guess the Court of Appeals would

have some sense of its own about what ought to be done.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, that's obviously one of the

options that this Court could exercise.

24

QUESTION:

25

somewhat different.

Well, your motives and ours may be
I think probably this Court's interest is

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

to see which of the two Courts of Appeals was correct' as to

2

where this appeal should have gone to, and your motive is

2

obviously to obtain a victory for your client, just like any

4

good lawyer.

But your appeal has -- it was not heard on the merits
in the Seventh Circuit, was it?

7

MR. LEFSTEIN:

And was it heard on the merits -- it was

That's correct, Your Honor.

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, wait a minute.

I want to back

off that answer for just a second.

It

was your opponent who took the appeal -- was it you or your

20

opponent that took the appeal originally from the Rock Island

2I

court?

22

MR. LEFSTEIN:

The -- it was our opponent, Colt, the

22

Defendant, who had a summary judgment entered against it by the

24

District Judge, who took the appeal initially to the Federal

25

Circuit, and then the Plaintiff, Charles Christianson, moved to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

transfer the case to the Seventh Circuit on the ground that the

2

Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction, and at that point,

3

the Federal Circuit, after receiving briefs on that question,

4

and presumably considering the whole issue, entered an order

5

which specifically said that we don't -- I think the language

6

was probably a three-line order, which said we see no basis for

7

any jurisdiction in our court, and accordingly, and I'm

8

paraphrasing now, we transfer the case to the United States

r>

Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

.1.0’

QUESTION:

Yes, but the only question for us to

11

decide, I gather, is which of the courts was the proper court

12

for which the appeal should have been taken.

1.3
14

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, that's obviously one of the

questions.

It

QUESTION:

But if we were to decide that, then can't

16

we send back the merits to whichever court we think should have

17

had the appeal?

10

MR. LEFSTEIN:

t’J

QUESTION:

That's obviously one option, but --

If you decide the Federal Circuit had

20

jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has already decided the

21

merits.

22

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, if that's your answer, that's

23

one of the approaches that you could, take.

I might just

24

mention that we have presented -- the first question actually

25

states "may a court rule on the merits after it expressly
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

States that it has no jurisdiction", and I suppose,

2

technically, if you answer that question in the negative, and

3

if you viewed that question as dispositive, then I think you

4

could actually say that the Federal Circuit should not have

5

decided it also.

f>
7

QUESTION:

argue the second question, the question of jurisdiction.

8
9
in

Well, yes, but we told you to brief and

MR. LEFSTEIN:
correct.

That's right, Your Honor.

That's

And if you view that one as dispositive -QUESTION:

If we decided that first and agreed with

11

the Federal Circuit as to jurisdiction, we could just say then

12

that they shouldn't have decided the merits.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LEFSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

But then where does that leave the case?
Okay.

If you agree --

There is no question presented as to the

correctness of the decision on merits.

17

MR. LEFSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

in

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, there was a question --

There is none here.
At the present time, there is not such

70

a question.

In our prayer for relief at the conclusion of our

71

briefs, we have suggested that if the Court should decide that

77

the Federal Circuit was wrong in saying it did not have

23

jurisdiction and, in fact, had jurisdiction, we have renewed

24

our request that you accept certiorari on the merits.

25

realize that's strictly up to this Court.

QUESTION:

There has never been an appellate opinion

on the merits in this case, is that correct?
3
4

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Mo, that's incorrect.

The Federal

Circuit gave an opinion on the merits.
QUESTION:

5

You do not question that if we decide that

6

the Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction, an available

7

form of relief would be for us to simply send the case back to

0

the Seventh Circuit?

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Q

10

Could we do that?
That is one of the options.

I've

always assumed this Court in exercising -QUESTION:

Could do any type -- oh, I see.

QUESTION:

We like to think there's some statutory

14

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. LEFSTEIN:

11

13

policy.

Well, the statutory power is under

16

Section 1631, which indicates a transfer if it is in the

17

interests of justice, and, so, we've made some arguments

10

concerning the matter of whether it is in the interest of

19

justice.

QUESTION:

What do you want us

to do with it?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

22
appeal.
24

I renew my question.

Our preference is that you dismiss the

That you send it back to the Federal Circuit with

directions that the appeal be dismissed.
QUESTION:

In other words, you don't want us to let
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the Seventh Circuit hear the merits if the Federal Circuit had
2
3
4
5

no jurisdiction?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

If you agree with us that it's not in

the interest of justice to retransfer it, -QUESTION:

And the reason you say it's not in the

6

interest of justice is because Colt made some misleading

7

statements in characterizing your complaint?

0

MR. LEFSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But this was the same complaint that two

10

circuits was inartfully drafted?

11

MR. LEFSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13
j.4

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, you also make a point they didn't

cross petition.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

That's correct, and I think that

Ij

that's a highly significant point, and because what Colt is

16

really seeking is a form of remedy which is a transfer back to

17

the Seventh Circuit which could get Colt more or less relief

18

than what they received from the Federal Circuit.

19

qet more relief because they also had a claim for a cross

20

motion for summary judgment.

21

They could

The Federal Circuit did not give them that relief,

37

but, arguably, the Seventh Circuit could, so a transfer could

23

get them more relief than, of course, under one of the cases we

24

cite, I think the Federal Energy case.

39

to be a modification which would give less relief, there's a

Even if there's going

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation

duty to cross petition.
QUESTION:

May I ask, though?

There a lot of things

that can be done here, but would you tell me which court you
think had jurisdiction and why?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

I certainly will. The court that we

say had jurisdiction is the Federal Circuit, and -- I'm sorry.
Is the Seventh Circuit, and the reason for that is that we're
dealing with the well-pleaded complaint doctrine.

We're

dealing with the traditional concepts of arising under
jurisdiction.
The Seventh Circuit had jurisdiction if the Federal
Circuit did not. The Federal Circuit only has jurisdiction of
those cases that "arise under Section 1338".
QUESTION:

Let me ask.

You basically agree with

Judge Markey's discussion on the jurisdiction issue, I gather?
MR. LEFSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

What would you say if half way through the

trial, you had filed an amended complaint which clearly was
predicated on the patent laws and the section that they
construed in this case, would there -- which court would have
jurisdiction then?
your complaint.

Not the original complaint, but you amended

Didn't wait to conform to the rules, but --

and then, from then on, that's all the Court did, was resolve
the issues raised by your amended complaint, who would have
jurisdiction?
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. LEFSTEIN:

I think under the well-pleaded

2

complaint doctrine, the Seventh Circuit would still have

3

jurisdiction.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

You look at the original complaint and you

don't even look at any substantive amendments?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Even if, arguably, you look at

7

subsequent amendments, I think you still have to, under the

8

well-pleaded complaint doctrine, and I think this is explained

9

very careful in the Franchise Tax Board case, you're still

10
1 I

dealing with what is the Plaintiff's cause of action.
QUESTION:

Yes, but those cases really dealt with the

12

question of whether the trial court had federal jurisdiction.

1.3

Here, the question is whether an appellate court has

14

jurisdiction, and why does it make a lot more sense to say at

15

the time of the appeal, let's see what was decided in the trial

16

court and what is a fair constructive complaint at that time.

.17

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Okay.

And the simple reason for this

18

is that when Congress set up the jurisdiction of the Federal

19

Circuit, Congress didn't create some new standard for the

20

Federal Circuit.

21

appellate jurisdiction is going to hinge precisely on the

22

jurisdiction of the District Court.

23

What Congress said was the Federal Circuit's

So, your question seemingly assumes that there's some

24

different standard under Section 1295 which relates to the

25

Federal Circuit, but 1295 jurisdiction hinges on whether there
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

was a rise in under-jurisdiction in the District Court, and if

n

__

3

QUESTION:

So that your answer is basically that even

4

thought it might make a lot of sense, that's not what the

5

statute does.

6

MR. LEFSTEIN:

That's a good answer.

I think

7

Congress has spoken on this, and if you read the reports which

8

have been cited, and I might say, with all the disagreements

9

that Colt and Christianson have in this case, right in their

10

brief, they agree right at the outset that what we're dealing

11

with are the traditional concepts of arising under jurisdiction

12

and they cite the same congressional report that we cite, and

13

that Congress specifically rejected some form of issue

14

jurisdiction for the Federal Circuit as opposed to case

15

jurisdiction because case jurisdiction is the standard under

U>

the arising understanding.

17

QUESTION:

Well, sometimes it's hard to know the

18

answer under the arising under standard.

IS’

presumption or expertise be given to the Court of Appeals for

20

the Federal Circuit in deciding those guestions of its own

21

jurisdiction

22

Should any special

or not?

MR. LEFSTEIN:

I think the concepts of arising under,

23

although we have a hundred years of history with respect to

24

those concepts, nonetheless, I think they are tests which

25

probably any court is competent or should be competent to
14
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

I

7

decide.
I might say this, this issue arose for the first time

3

in the Federal Circuit.

It didn't arise in the Seventh

4

Circuit, and what we have is a situation where the Seventh

5

Circuit clearly has jurisdiction if the Federal Circuit did

6

not, and, therefore, what we were really dealing with was the

7

jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, even though it impacts on

0

the Seventh Circuit.

c

9
I. 0

And it simply seems to us that the Federal Circuit
having examined whether it had jurisdiction and having heard

II.

briefs on the matter and having entered an order that that

17

order should have been given respect by the Seventh Circuit.

13

In fact, there's an argument in both briefs on the law of the

1.4

case doctrine.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

If we went off on that ground, we would

settle nothing except this case.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, that's certainly so, but I've

18

read several opinions where this Court has said that they

19

decide matters on narrow grounds, but if the Court is going to

30

fashion a decision which is going to address the matter of

31

which Court, in fact, had jurisdiction, then obviously you

22

couldn't go on some type of law of the case argument.

23

But what I would like to emphasize, I suppose, and I

24

think Justice Stevens just a few minutes ago asked me to

25

explain why the Federal Circuit did not have jurisdiction and
15

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

the Seventh Circuit did, simply is that we had an anti-trust

2

complaint.

j

reference in one paragraph that even mentioned this patent

4

issue, this so-called 112 issue, and that paragraph didn't say,

5

didn't make any claim at all that there were invalid patents.

6

We made no allegation, except there was one

QUESTION:

Well, the claim is that the case went

7

forward in the District Court solely or principally on the

8

patent issues.

9
10
i1

12

MR. LEFSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, the case on --

And, so, it's as though the complaint

hadn't been amended.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, but, of course, using that

13

analysis would contravene all of the years of teaching on this

14

subject and as it culminated in Franchise Tax Board, which is

15

that we look at the complaint, and the posture in which that

.1 0

issue arose --

17

QUESTION:

What I'm saying is it's just as though

18

there's an amended complaint filed because if the patent

19

issues, we're predominated.

20

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, if that was the case, then we

2 1

could have had that resolved in Franchise Tax Board because the

22

clear holding in the language of Franchise Tax Board is that
even where the only issue truly at issue in the case is the

24

matter that's decided, if that didn't arise in the complaint,

25

if that was a defense, then we don't have jurisdiction, and
16

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

what we had here was an anti-trust
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Lefstein, suppose there are cases in

3

which there is a tradition of construing federal jurisdiction

4

narrowly, as the federal courts are courts of limited

r

jurisdiction, but here Congress was concerned about creating a

6

specialized tribunal who would decide patent issues because

7

there was expertise there that wasn't share by the courts

8

around the country.

9

So, is it really compulsory that we follow the same

10

strict analysis that would apply in the federal jurisdiction

11

cases in a case like this?

12

appellate jurisdiction, too.

13
14

MR. LEFSTEIN:

I think we're talking about

I understand.

I can only answer that

by saying that Congress has spoken in this particular area.
QUESTION:

15

You think they considered this problem of

16

amended complaints and maybe a case does change its posture as

17

it develops in the trial?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

18
19

20
2I
22

I think they did, and what I base that

on -QUESTION:

What's the most illuminating discussion of

this particular aspect of it that you can point me to?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

There is a statement and it's cited in

T T

both briefs, and we didn't tag on one further statement to it,

24

but the statement in the congressional reports -- I think --

25

r'm not sure if it's the Senate or the House, it states that
17

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the test of appellate jurisdiction depends on District Court
jurisdiction and that there is arising under jurisdiction in
the District Court in the same sense that there is arising
under, and I'm paraphrasing now, that there is arising under
jurisdiction with federal question jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

That's right.

That's in the legislative history, but I'm asking you is there
any discussion in the legislative history that you're aware of
of the problem of a case during the process of trial changing
its character somewhat from what it looked like on the
complaint to what it looks like after you get into the evidence
and perhaps amend the pleadings and that.
I don't think that's even discussed in the history.
MR. LEFSTEIN:

I don't recall anything directed to

that, and I might add that with the statement I just
paraphrased from the congressional record, they then state
contrast Coastal States which was a case of the temporary
emergency Court of Appeals, which went off on issue
jurisdiction.
So, the congressional record was clearly saying we're
not going to do that here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lefstein, you think the majority of

members in Congress and the President understood the wellpleaded complaint doctrine?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

I hesitate to speak for them all.
18

Heritage Reporting Corporation

QUESTION:

This is all very fanciful, isn't it?

You don't know if they understood the

I obviously can't speak to that.

You think -- you want to make a guess

about it?
MR. LEFSTEIN:

It depends what the experience of the

18

lawyers were, who were on these committees.

19

occasion to go into the well-pleaded complaint doctrine.

20

think, though, on that statute, what I should emphasize is they

21

didn't enact a new District Court jurisdictional statute.

22

left Section 1338 just as it was, and they said, we're going to

23

peg the appellate jurisdiction to what the jurisdiction -- to

24

what 1338 says.

QUESTION:

If they had

MR. LEFSTEIN:

and in this case,

I think it does make sense, even

10

if we want to ignore what Congress seemingly said,

II

we want to look at mere policy because what we have is a

and even if

There is discussion of that in the congressional

That we don't want one court that's just going to be

deciding one particular thing, and I might also point out that

17

in this particular area, what we're doing here with the 112

issue as it arose in this case,

19

question, and the irony of the case is that the Federal Circuit

20

has specifically said,

that federal pre-emption questions, which this Section 112

and that we're going to follow the law of the regional circuit.

25

So that had the Court of Appeals for the Federal

20

Circuit

actually come out with a different result on the

2

merits,

they would have looked to Seventh Circuit law to the

3

extent that they could have divined it to determine whether or

4

not there was federal pre-emption under the patent laws and, of

5

course, this particular case is going to mean that if the

6

result was different because of the exclusivity provision in

7

Section

8

the states now have a right to hear cases involving patent

issues, but not patent cases, that any decision in a case such

10

as this, and the Federal Circuit gave an example, if there was

11

a state law anti-trust case brought, that that would mean even

12

though they've heard these cases for a hundred years because of

13

that exclusivity provision, they would have to come out of the

14

state courts and into the federal courts.

15

1338, which means that the states must hear -- where

So, I think an answer to the question that as a

matter of policy, the arising under concept makes sense because

17

I don't think it's beneficial to bring all of the traditional

cases that the states have held and bring them into the federal

QUESTION:

May I ask another question?

The language

of 1295(a)(1) is that there's jurisdiction in the Federal

23

situation where we have solely an anti-trust case.

there's no count at all that's based on the

4

here because the complaint was so incomplete and poorly

5

drafted.

6

QUESTION:

1338, I think as your opponent points out,

7

it talks about having original jurisdiction of any civil action

8

arising under any act of Congress relating to patents.

9

Now, you say you can simply rely on the judgment?

10
11

MR. RADICE:

We are saying that -- two things, Your

Honor.

12

First, that you can use the decision, the judgment,

13

the summary judgment motion to determine what are the necessary

14

allegations of the complaint.

15

QUESTION:

But ordinarily you think of 1338 as a

16

grant of jurisdiction, and that people should know when the

17

complaint is filed whether the Court has jurisdiction or not.

10

MR. RADICE:

Ordinarily, and it would be the first

19

issue if the question were state versus federal jurisdiction,

20

but the alternative basis for jurisdiction here would be under

2I

the anti-trust laws.

22

So, there's no question of federal jurisdiction per

24

that allegation.

The

allegation generally, but when you come to talk specifically

1.1

about patents, you admit that the patents are valid.

12
13
14

In other words, you're saying there's no patent issue
in this case.

That's what your answer says.

MR. RADICE:

I think that the allegations may not

15

match each other, Your Honor.

Perhaps it's poor draftsmanship.

16

It perhaps should have read as an averral of patent validity.

17

Paragraph 18 is a confusing paragraph, and we would

18

all have been better served had, as Judge Nichols said in his

19

dissent, we called for an amended complaint at the time or a

20

more definite statement of what the complaint was, but we did

2I

not, and now we must try to interpret what that complaint

22

means, and it's our position that the way that one can -- the

23

best way, the most reliable way to determine what the necessary

24

allegations are of Plaintiff's real case is to look at the

25

summary judgment motion, to look at the claim that was actually
30
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

litigated and actually adjudicated.

2

Whether we do that under the -- following the

3

principles of the well-pleaded complaint rule, there are cases

4

that go beyond the four corners of the bare words of the

5

complaint to try to interpret what are the necessary

6

allegations of the complaint, or whether we apply Rule 15(b) of

7

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we come to the same

8

conclusion.

9

Rule 15(b), even without a formal amendment, requires

I0

that the pleadings be treated as amended to conform to the

II

proof.

12
1.3

QUESTION:

Well, that's the end of the well-pleaded

complaint doctrine then, isn't it?

14

MR. RADICE:

15

QUESTION:

I don't think so, Your Honor.
We could call it the well-tried case

16

doctrine because whatever comes out automatically is considered

17

to amend the complaint and whatever the case shows is

1.8

determined by federal jurisdiction.

19

MR. RADICE:

If it comes up under 1295, only as

20

regards the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction versus another

21

appellate court's jurisdiction, and it's only at that stage

22

that you have a record in between —

12

MR. RADICE:

It is fixed. Number one, it can change.

13

Number two, we do read this complaint as a patent complaint and

14

we did so at the time, and one of the reasons we did was

because

this was not the first time we had seen this issue.
In the Springfield litigation, which we brought Mr.

17

Christianson, into the Springfield litigation as a defendant, in

IB

that action, we were also seeking to enforce trade secrets.

19

The defense in that action was this Section 112 theory that our

20

trade secrets and patents were invalid because of 112.

21

The action went up on appeal, got a preliminary

22

injunction, and we were upheld.

The preliminary injunction was

23

upheld.

24

to the District Court, he turned around and filed this

25

complaint, the instant complaint.

MR. RADICE:

Well, I think Rule 15(b) was written

precisely for this situation, that where the parties had not

not recognized the change in the

theory between pleading and

trial, that one -- de facto, it

should be recognized and considered an amended pleading.

We

QUESTION:

That's correct.
You have suggested the case, and I'm

curious and I don't know if this is the law, but in your brief,

you cite a case in which there was a patent claim asserted in

QUESTION:

What was the -- the Atari case, which was

heard en banc, was one that also looked at subsequent

developments, was it not?

i0

MR. RADICE:

Well, it looked at subsequent

11

developments and in Atari, there was an attempt after the

12

decision to separate the copyright case from which there had

13

been a judgment and the patent part of the complaint and the

14

Federal Circuit essentially held that that attempted separation

was not affected.

It's kind of a unique set of facts.

Typically, a

MR. LEFSTEIN:

Well, there's nothing different about

our theory than every case.

I mean, if you're going to say

that in our case, you could have said that in Franchise Tax
Board, and, of course, what happened here in our particular
case was that the Section 112 issue was in the pleadings.

It

was in our reply to Colt's counter claims.
So, this whole business about Section 15(b) -- by the
way, Section 15(b) doesn't say that the complaint is amended,
it said that the pleadings can be so, and what we have in this
particular situation, we had the 112 issue, but it came up way
down stream from the complaint.
So that we really had no patent issue in this case
until Colt in its answer said we're justifying our anti­
competitive conduct with

a claim of state law protected trade

secrets, and then, in an argument and in a reply to that claim
of state law trade secrets, we injected the patent pre-emption
issue for the first time, and that's the way it stayed through
the end of this lawsuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNOUIST:
