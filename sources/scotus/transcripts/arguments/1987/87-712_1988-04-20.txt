ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL PETITIONERS/RESPONDENTS

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents jurisdictional questions.

The

Grant Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human

10

Services disallowed $11.3 million in federal financial

11

participation under the Medicaid program to the Commonwealth of

12

Massachusetts.

13

in the United States District Court for the Commonwealth of

14

Massachusetts claiming that that court has jurisdiction.

15

position is that the United States Claims Court has

16

jurisdiction.

17

The Commonwealth challenged that disallowance

The Court of Appeals agreed with each side in part.

18

We petitioned this Court to review the Court's partial

19

assertion of jurisdiction, and the Commonwealth

20

cross-petitioned to review the Court's partial refusal to

21

exercise jurisdiction.

22

both granted.

determined that Massachusetts had improperly claimed Medicaid

reimbursement for certain educational services that the State

5

Department of Education was required to pay for.

6

in federal financial participation was disallowed, and that is

7

a small fraction of the total federal financial participation

for Massachusetts at these facilities in the years in question.
As was its right, Massachusetts challenged that

$11.3 million

10

disallowance in the Grant Appeals Board, an entity created by

11

regulation in 1973 to review disallowances on behalf of the

12

Secretary.

13

The money has since been recouped by reducing certain Medicaid

14

grants to Massachusetts in subsequent years.

15

The Grant Appeals Board upheld the disallowances.

In response to the GAB decisions, Massachusetts filed

16

complaints for judicial review in the District Court.

17

Commonwealth recognized that there is no statute providing

18

specifically for judicial review of disallowance decisions.

19

The

The complaints did assert that 5 U.S.C 702, part of

20

the Administrative Procedure Act, waives the sovereign immunity

21

of the United States, and permits this kind of action to

22

proceed in District Court.

23

The District Court said that it had jurisdiction.

24

The District Court disagreed with the Grant Appeals Board

25

decisions in their entirety, and said that the Commonwealth was

4
Reporting Corporation

1

entitled to federal financial participation for all of these

2

services, and entered a judgment reversing the Grant Appeals

3

Board.

4

We appealed, and argued among other things that the

5

District Court had entered a money judgment against the United

6

States without any applicable waiver of sovereign immunity that

7

permitted such a judgment.

8
9

The problem with using 5 U.S.C.

702 as the applicable

waiver of sovereign immunity is that that statute applies only

10

to actions

11

contend that the $11.3 million at issue here is money damages.

12

"seeking relief other than money damages".

We

Now it is important to understand that we were not

arguing that the Grant Appeals Board decisions were

unreviewable.

15

permitted an action in the United States Claims Court.

17

Rather our position was that the Tucker Act

is there not,

21

MR. ENGLERT:

22

QUESTION:

in Courts of Appeal about whether

There is a split in the circuits, yes.

And the Court of Appeals for the District

23

of Columbia takes the view that money damages does not mean

24

what you say it means in that statute?

25

I

MR. ENGLERT:

Heritage

That is correct.

That court actually

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

stands along among the Courts of Appeal.
QUESTION:

2
3

So that is really the crux of what we need

to focus on, I suppose, in this case.
MR. ENGLERT:

4

That is correct.

That is the crux of

5

the issue presented by the Commonwealth's cross-petition, and

6

we think that it is really the crux of the issue presented by

7

our petition, too.
That question is addressed rather squarely in the

8
9

legislative history of the 1976 amendments to the APA.

When

10

Congress used the phrase money damages, it meant monetary

11

relief as opposed to declaratory injunctive mandamus relief.
QUESTION:

12

Why do you suppose that Congress did not

13

use language like is used in the Tucker Act if they intended it

14

to mean the same thing?

15

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, there actually is no language in

16

the Tucker Act that refers to money damages.

The Tucker Act is

17

a very old statute.

18

Claims Court under the Tucker Act have been inferred from the

19

surrounding context, and not directly from the language of that

20

statute.

And the limitations on the powers of the

It is a very broadly written statute.
In any event, I think that Congress took a proposal

21

22

that was given to it by the Administrative Conference, a

23

proposal that is backed up by numerous memoranda that often

24

refer to all forms of monetary relief being excluded from the

25

proposal.

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

The Administrative Conference happened to use the

2

words money damages, words that are not unnatural to use to

3

describe all forms of monetary relief, and those are the words

4

that Congress enacted.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I guess that Judge Bork in his

6

opinion for the CADC found some legislative history the other

7

way.

8
9

MR. ENGLERT:

Very little, Your Honor.

He relied

almost entirely on a single reference to grant-in-aid programs

10

in the House report and the Senate report.

That reference is a

11

part of a long list of actions in which sovereign immunity had

12

been asserted in the past and might not be asserted in the

13

future under the APA amendments.

14

lawsuit has to be an action seeking the payment of money by the

15

federal government.

16

QUESTION:

17

Does a state in the position of Massachusetts have

Not every grant-in-aid

Well, let me ask you on that point.

18

any ability to prevent recoupment by the government during the

19

appeals process, so that they would not be in the position of

20

needing to ask for the money back?

21

MR. ENGLERT:

Some states have succeeded in

22

preventing recoupment, albeit under an assertion of

23

jurisdiction that we think is invalid.

24

no proper means to prevent recoupment.

25

QUESTION:

We think that they have

So in your view as a practical matter, a

7

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

state will always be in the position of having to seek money

2

damages in effect, and always be channeled to the Court of

3

Claims in any of these grant programs.

4

an interpretation of the statutory language, in the

5

government's view, they are always going to be channeled to the

6

Court of Claims.

7

MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor.

So that when they want

Suppose the Secretary

8

promulgated a new regulation.

9

effect, if it were to take effect January 1, 1989, and on

And before that ever took

10

April 20, 1988, the state brought a prospective challenge to

11

that regulation.

12

like promulgating a regulation saying that there will be no

13

further reimbursement for intermediate care facilities for the

14

mentally retarded period.

15

Say the Secretary did something outrageous

There is no accrued monetary claim in that case, and

16

there is not going to be an accrued monetary claim during the

17

initial pendency of the lawsuit.

18

letting the District Courts address that and grant a

19

declaratory relief.

20

QUESTION:

And we have no problems

Would you have trouble with just a

21

declaratory judgment that says here is the situation, we are in

22

disagreement with the government on this issue, we do not ask

23

for an injunction now, or any money, or anything else, we just

24

want a judgment, and we think that the Secretary will live up

25

to the judgment?

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. ENGLERT:

2

QUESTION:

If they do not want money.

Well, they do not ask for it.

But if

3

there is a judgment, they are probably then going to go to the

4

Court of Claims, and the legal issue will have been settled.

5

MR. ENGLERT:

But the ordinary rules of

6

res adjudicata, as we understand them, preclude that kind of

7

claims splitting, first getting your judgment in one court, and

8

then bringing a separate claim in another court.

9

QUESTION:

10

just to declaratory judgment?

11

I am just asking you, would you object

MR. ENGLERT:

Standing alone, we would not.

Although

12

we would object if they were then successful in transforming

13

that into a money judgment for past due money in the Claims

14

Court, yes.

15

QUESTION:

What is the District Court who gets

16

something like that supposed to do, I recall confronting this

17

on the D.C. Circuit, are you supposed to deem that to include a

18

claim for monetary relief or not.

19

You know, the usual rule, what court you are in is to

20

be adjudged on the basis of the complaint, right, and a

21

complaint is deemed to be amended to show that you get all of

22

the relief that the proof entitles you to.

23

And when you are asking for a declaratory judgment in

24

a matter where it is clear that the effect of that declaratory

25

judgment will entitle you to money, I assume that without any

9

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

amendment of the complaint at all that the court that enters

2

the declaratory judgment ought to enter an order for the money

3

relief as well, should it not?

4

MR. ENGLERT:

5

QUESTION:

I think that is right.

So really what you say is that the state

6

can bring the action if they specifically disclaim any desire

7

for monetary relief.

8

declaratory judgment, but say we are asking for a declaratory

9

judgment, and we waive all right for monetary relief.

Not just bring it purely for a

MR. ENGLERT:

10

We do think that that is the better

11

view.

And alternative view would be to say that the state may

12

bring the claim, but is foreclosed from later seeking money.

13

But we think that the view that you just stated is the better

14

approach.

15

QUESTION:

But there is a way to do it?

16

MR. ENGLERT:

17

QUESTION:

There is a way to do it, yes.

So you think that the government, if there

18

was a declaratory judgment which you did not object to, you

19

think that the government would then still refuse to refund the

20

money, if it had been adjudged finally in a court that the

21

Secretary had been wrong all the way?

22

MR. ENGLERT:

If we thought that the state had

23

brought the action in District Court to secure District Court

24

jurisdiction over an action that should have been in the Claims

25

Court if the state wanted money, I think that we might very

10

well take that position.
QUESTION:

3

even disclaims.

QUESTION:

10

Even though you had been unlawful all the

way?
MR. ENGLERT:

8
9

Well, if they say that they do not want

any money, we are not going to give them any money.

6
7

It

It did not want any money.

MR. ENGLERT:

4
5

Well, the state did not ask for money.

Again if the state said that it did not

want it and secured jurisdiction in that manner, we would not
see any reason.
QUESTION:

11

Well, Mr. Englert, there is some

12

legislative history, as you have acknowledged, that indicates

13

that Congress did expect these grant-in-aid programs to be

14

decided in the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal.
MR. ENGLERT:

15

Well, as I say, there is a single

16

reference to grant-in-aid programs in both committee reports.

17

Justice O'Connor, not all changes to administration

18

of grant-in-aid programs involve seeking money from the federal

19

government.

20

Court heard just last month.

21

the federal government's administration of the grant-in-aid

22

program.

23

that program is administered violates the establishment clause.

A good example is Bowen v. Kendrick, which this

2

certainly some indication that Congress thought that these

3

issues were better resolved in the crucible of the Federal

4

District Courts and the Courts of Appeal where they can give a

5

considered judgment to these questions.

6

that stuff to the Claims Court just seems to me to be a very

7

troublesome view of the matter.

18

QUESTION:

There is nothing less

No, but it is often very helpful, of

19

course, to have different Circuit Courts of Appeal focusing in

20

on some very tough issues that we get.

21

MR. ENGLERT:

That is correct, of course, Your Honor.

22

But also, the whole purpose of the Claims Court and the Federal

23

Circuit is to centralize certain matters.

24

QUESTION:

25

do not forget that.

That can happen under the Tucker Act, too,

But from a practical standpoint, does it not make a

18

lot of sense to have this kind of case in the regional circuit

19

rather than in the Court of Claims?

20

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, there are policy arguments that

21

can be made to some of these cases in various places.

There

are also policy arguments that can be made in favor of

and the APA dovetail to do.

And that is what we think that the Tucker Act

excludes actions for money damages.
QUESTION:

Well, it is not all that clear.

It

applies to all actions seeking relief other than money damages.
And I am not sure if one reads that language literally and you
have an action which seeks a declaratory judgment which is
relief other than money damages and also seeks money damages,
that a literal reading of the language would not necessarily
foreclose jurisdiction.
MR. ENGLERT:

A literal reading of that language

would not necessarily by itself foreclose jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

That is right.

MR. ENGLERT:
work here.

But there are two other things that

One is the overall intent of Congress, which we do

think is to put money cases in one place and non-money cases in
the other.

And the other is Section 704, which allows a

non-statutory review which is what we have here only when there
is no other adequate remedy in a court.

And a money action in

the Claims Court certainly is an adequate remedy in the
circumstances of this case.
The Court of Appeals, which did not address
Section 704, thought that it was appropriate to entertain the
so-called declaratory aspects of this case.

It affirmed what

it called a declaratory judgment, merely because the Grant
Appeals Board decisions are precedents.
That is the only significant prospective effect, as

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the Court called it, that there was that justified the

2

splitting of the claim into two courts.

perfectly adequate.

And if the Claims Court

Now you rely primarily on 704 rather than

702 .

14
15

also, our overall perception of the intent of Congress, which

16

has one statute which has been on the books since 1887 that

17

allows money actions to be brought against the federal

18

government, and another statute that excludes money damages

19

with a lot of legislative history backing it up.

20

MR. ENGLERT:

QUESTION:

On that issue, that is correct.

And

But is it not true as a matter of history

21

that in some of these cases that the government did not take

22

the position that you are taking now, that they allowed some of

23

these cases to go forward in the District Courts outside of the

24

Court of Claims?

25

MR. ENGLERT:

fc

Heritage

That is correct, the issue was not

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

addressed.
QUESTION:

It was not as obvious as it is now.

QUESTION:

Did the government raise this argument at

the District Court level in this case?
MR. ENGLERT:
QUESTION:

Yes, but.

Yes, but what?

MR. ENGLERT:

The Secretary has decided as a matter

of policy not to pursue objections to jurisdiction in this
case.

Of course, that is not something that we could not bind

the court to accept jurisdiction by making that unfortunate
statement, and it was resolved on the merits by the District
Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Englert, let me also ask you whether

you think that the 704 adequate remedy question or
determination should be made case by case or on the basis of
categories of things?
MR. ENGLERT:

I do not think that it can be made in

an absolute sense for any and all cases for all times.
Certainly, there are categories of cases.

And we think that

grant disallowance cases involving crude monetary claims are a
category of cases in which that Claims Court remedy will in all
cases, we would think, be adequate.
QUESTION:

Even though prospective relief is sought?

MR. ENGLERT:

Even though prospective relief is

sought.

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

And even though you might have changing

administrations, and new administrators, and different policies
in the future.

And you just think that people ought to be

foreclosed from getting that prospective relief order.
MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.

Because it is not the

government's position that matters, but it is the court's
position that matters.

And when the Claims Court in

adjudicating the money claim decides an issue of law, that is
binding upon the federal government in all future dealings with
the same party.
The Claims Court is a perfectly competent court to
address these issues, as it has in Medicare cases, and in other
kinds of judicial review actions in the past.
QUESTION:

Where is the legislative history referring

to grant-in-aid cases that you were discussing with
Justice O'Connor earlier, that came up in what context?
MR. ENGLERT:

Page eight of the Senate report, and

also page nine of the virtually identical House report.

The

sentence is, "The doctrine has been invoked in hundreds of
cases each year concerning," the doctrine meaning the doctrine
of sovereign immunity, "has been invoked in hundreds of cases
each year concerning agricultural regulations, governmental
employment, tax investigations, postal rate matters,
administration of labor legislation, control of subversive
activities, food and drug regulation, and administration of

impossible to interpret it to be referring to any invocation

That is how we

Our opponents read them differently.
QUESTION:

Yes, I recall that the briefs seem to

disagree on that point.
Did the claim for the money relief here precisely
track the claim for injunctive and prospective relief?

It

would seem to me that sometimes in the grant-in-aid programs
that the state would be objecting to an overall interpretation
of a regulation and see prospective relief.

And then there

would some discrete instances where they would want money back.
And it would seem to me that the two might not track each
other.
MR. ENGLERT:

I am not sure that such cases would

arise, but that would be a different case from this one.

This

one is a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the only prospective
effect that the Court of Appeals identified was that the Grant
Appeals Board stood as precedence.

And the only prospective

relief that any court granted is what the Court of Appeals
called so much of the judgment below as constitutes a
declaratory judgment that the Secretary's blanket special
education exclusion is in excess of statutory authority.

In other words, that was the underlying issue that
the Claims Court would have resolved, and the District Court
did resolve, but the Claims Court would have resolved if this
money case had been brought there in the first place.
QUESTION:

The First Circuit said that in the Claims

Court that its judgment would be collateral estoppel.
Do you accept that proposition, can the government be
collaterally estopped?
MR. ENGLERT:

Well, the government can be

collaterally estopped under the Stauffer Chemical and Montana
cases.
QUESTION:

So if the First Circuit is correct, then

there is estoppel in the Claims Court, you concede that?
MR. ENGLERT:

No.

We think that the usual rule is

that when an action is brought in one court, and then a
separate claim is split from that and brought in a separate
court, that the Plaintiff loses all right to proceed on that
separate claim.

It is complicated here, because the

Plaintiff -QUESTION:

No.

I am saying that let us assume for

the moment that we affirm the First Circuit and its reasoning.
Would you then concede that you are collaterally

I did not think so.

On the grounds that our analysis of the

United States is the Claims Court.

about the money.
Would not the government pay the money to the state,
or would they take this position that there is a legal defense,
and we will not pay even though the state was entitled to it?
MR. ENGLERT:

Well, the problem would not be

collateral estoppel.
QUESTION:

It is not just collateral estoppel.

It is

really how one thinks that the government should operate when
the Supreme Court of the United States has held that they
violated the law.

Often, we used to have cases where we would

not enjoin the state.

We entered declaratory judgments on the

assumption that the state would accept the rule of law.
But the government, you are telling me, if I
understand you correctly, that the executive department says,
well, they do not have a legal right to get it, even though we
have no legal right to retain it, so we are going to make them
litigate for it?
MR. ENGLERT:

Justice Stevens, I said in the context

of a question whose underlying premise was the state brought an
action in which it disclaimed the right to monetary relief.

It

was so important to the state to get into the District Court
rather than the Claims Court, that the state was willing to
forego.

Heritage

you.
In this case, the Court of Appeals has held that the
regulatory decision made by the Secretary was erroneous and
violated the statute.

And if we had affirmed that on the

merits and did not say anything about money, you are suggesting
to me that the Secretary would not pay the state the money.
MR. ENGLERT:

I thought that you were saying that we would make the defense

MR. ENGLERT:

The point, Justice Stevens, is that we

might make the collateral estoppel argument, but we would be
foolish to reargue the merits in the Claims Court, which of
course would be bound by this Court's disposition of the
merits.

it.
MR. ENGLERT:

Justice Stevens, my answer to the

questions about collateral estoppel is that we would argue
against collateral estoppel, so that we could relitigate in the
Claims Court.
QUESTION:

That is why I asked you if we had decided,

whether you would still do that.

So there would be nothing

more to relitigate on the merits.

MR. BARNICO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The importance of Circuit Court review that was
discussed earlier in the argument is not as Mr. Englert
suggests just a question of a policy preference.

In fact, as

one of the Justices has pointed out and one of the amicus
briefs has addressed, there is a certain familiarity that

Heritage

Circuit Courts develop with a given state's Medicaid plan and

2

disputes that might arise either between states or between the

3

Secretary and the state in this case.
But the more important point that I wish to address

4
5

on that score is that Congress has provided evidence that it

6

believes that the Circuit Court's role is important in these

7

cases.

8
9

And that is, and it cannot be disputed here, is that
when Congress addressed the question of judicial review of

10

disputes between the Secretary and the states under the

11

Medicaid program, that it expressly authorized states to bring

12

petitions to the Circuits Courts to review instances in which

13

the Secretary has found that states, or their plans, or their

14

amendments to their state plans are not in compliance with the

27

question of whether a given dispute between the states and the

In those cases that were litigated all over the

questions that arose under the program were indeed compliance

whether the Secretary had erroneously read the Medicaid Act to

9

exclude those services.

10

r

Now in that event, we would have had an appeal to the

And furthermore, Your Honor, those cases could also

11

implicate money as well.

Because under the Secretary's

12

regulations, if you are successful through the administrative

13

process and we presume through the judicial process in

14

successfully overturning the denial of an amendment, you are

15

entitled to a lump sum covering the services back to the time

16

that the amendment was submitted.

17

So with all respect, Your Honor, it does not merely

18

address situations where the state wishes to identify a legal

19

issue at the threshold and litigate that question before any

20

injury occurs.

21

QUESTION:

MR. BARNICO:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BARNICO:

25

You are entitled to a lump sum under 1316?
No, Your Honor.

Where do you get the lump sum?
The lump sum, Your Honor, is mentioned

in 45 CFR 201.3.

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

That is a regulation.

2

MR. BARNICO:

It is a regulation.

But you know, this

3

also implicates the previous response of my brother to the

4

question of a District Court action which merely tests the

5

validity of a regulation.

6

By way of background, one of the reasons why these

7

disallowance cases are growing is that the Secretary chooses to

8

implement policy judgments through the disallowance mechanism

9

rather than to specifically state through regulations what

10
11

services are covered and which are not.
And so when the Court considered the case a few terms

12

ago of Connecticut, a similar Connecticut state agency against

13

the Secretary, Connecticut cited the same sort of broad

14

disallowance that carried a prospective effect and implications

15

for further services given by that state.

16

So it may be well for Mr. Englert to say that in the

17

abstract that certain cases can still proceed when states

18

challenge regulations under a particular grant-in-aid program,

19

but it is very much part of this record that the disallowance

20

procedure is used for far different purposes than a technical

21

audit or the adjustment of an accounting error.

22

It is used, as both of the lower courts found, to

23

make prospective coercive judgments about the scope of the

24

Medicaid Act.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Barnico, I take it that you do

2

not urge the adoption of the line drawn by the Court of Appeals

3

in the District of Columbia Circuit, that money damages refers

4

to a sum of money used as compensatory relief, you are not

5

urging that line?

MR. BARNICO:

No, we are not, but we are urging

something similar.

I do not think that the District of Columbia Circuit

11

had anything different in mind when it said that when a court

12

makes a judgment that an administrator has violated the law

13

that it is making a specific remedy when it orders or its

4
5

judgment requires that administrator to turn over the money.
I think that the kind of relief and the line that we

6

suggest is in the same nature and produces the same result.

7

But I think that the decision of the District of Columbia

8

Circuit had more to do with prying a certain kind of monetary

relief away from the term money damages.

QUESTION:

Can your test be stated in one sentence?

MR. BARNICO:

District Courts under the waiver of sovereign immunity

Then the rule takes more than one
And it is that when the Court considers

that complaint in its entirety against the overall statutory
context of the subject matter, that it makes a determination
that the District Court is the court that will hear such a
case.
QUESTION:

Well, why should not the District Court

just say do you want to stay in this court or not; and if you
do, you better withdraw your claim for money damages?
MR. BARNICO:

Well, that is similar.

That would

depend, Your Honor, on whether it is merely -QUESTION:

That just really raises the question of

whether the Court of Appeals was correct.
MR. BARNICO:

And it raises the question of whether

the state is going to be required to make a binding waiver of
any monetary recovery.
QUESTION:

It does not have to have a binding waiver.

The District Court just says I am going to entertain this claim
for money damages, I do not have jurisdiction to do that.
MR. BARNICO:

And it may require that litigant

to simply drop whatever prayer that suggests the money
judgment
QUESTION:

What kind of prayer suggests that, by the

You know, there is the boilerplate at the end of every

complaint which says as such other relief as may be
appropriate.
What is money damages are appropriate, is that a
prayer for money damages?
MR. BARNICO:

I do not think that it would be a

prayer enough to defeat the jurisdiction of the District Court,
no.
QUESTION:

Do you think that everybody would think

that, to adopt a rule like that or something, can we train
pleaders to put in or not put in that provision?
MR. BARNICO:

No.

different kinds of pressures.

And pleaders are often faced with
And in this case, the complaint

was written before we knew that the Tucker Act even applied to
or could be argued that it could be applied to such a case.
Now the last point that I would like to make today
has to do with the relationship between the Federal Circuits
on the one hand and the Circuit Courts of Appeal on the
other.
Congress intended that the Federal Circuit and the
Claims Court have a specialized subject matter.

The Federal

Courts Improvement Act that was enacted by Congress in 1982
demonstrates that Congress has always sought to preserve the
Circuit Courts of Appeals as courts of general jurisdiction in
terms of subject matter.

Heritage

40
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The legislative history of that Act, we think, is
very important to the case, and provides a further statutory
context to decide our case.

There was no indication in the

legislative history of the Federal Courts Improvement Act that
suggests that Congress ever believed that the Federal Circuit
would become a national forum for resolution of questions under
the Social Security Act.
QUESTION:

But Congress could have just as easily,

and I think that the government argues here, have allocated
jurisdiction on the basis that we want all claims for money
judgment against the government to be tried in the Claims Court
and go to the Federal Circuit.
Now that means that the Federal Circuit will be
expounding on lots of different areas of the law, but that the
unifying factor would be the money judgment against the
government.
MR. BARNICO:
intent.

That is his competing argument on

And it is there that there is authority for the

proposition that Congress intended to centralize some cases or
cases involving money according to the Solicitor, and that we
happen to fall in those cases.
My point is that that rubs right up against Congress'
express intent to keep the Circuit Courts of Appeal available
for the kind of general questions of important social policy
like the Social Security Act.

Heritage

41

QUESTION:

Of course, your position means that the

government can go around every Circuit relitigating the same
issue.
MR. BARNICO:

And apparently, they are doing it in

this very case.
QUESTION:

Well, I know that.

In a way, it is

strange that the government wants to be able to litigate it
only once.
MR. BARNICO:

Well, they must have their reasons.

But I think that their result is inconsistent with judgments
that Congress has made about the subject matters of the cases
that will arise and be heard by the courts that were created in
1982 .
Finally, I should make the point that the Court has
previously identified at least one consequence of litigating in
the Claims Court.

And that is that when you litigate in the

Claims Court, that ordinarily you litigate in Washington.
And for the Court to adopt the view of the Solicitor
in this case is to impute to Congress the intent that
beneficiaries or states who have disputes with the Secretary
that involve money under the Medicaid Act will be litigating
their cases in Washington.

And we do not think that that is

an intent that is supported by any of the legislative
history.
QUESTION:

Does Massachusetts has an office here in

Heritage

42
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Washington?
MR. BARNICO:

I believe that the Governor has a small

office
QUESTION:

I think that most states do.

I do not

think that that would be so horrible.
MR. BARNICO:

I think that the point is much more

important as to the beneficiaries, Your Honor.

And it is made

by an amicus brief in that respect.
QUESTION:

If it is under $10,000, they can bring the

suit in District Court.
MR. BARNICO:

The little Tucker Act applies.

But

many of the class actions that are brought by legal service
organizations on behalf of those beneficiaries, some of which
happen to involve the states as Defendants, would ordinarily
involve more money than that.
In conclusion, Congress waived sovereign immunity for
these cases, and there is no question about that.

But Congress

did not intend to centralize cases such, and courts created in
1982 have no expertise in this particular area.

Congress

intended that we could bring these cases in our local District
Courts, and this Court should so hold.
Thank you very much.
