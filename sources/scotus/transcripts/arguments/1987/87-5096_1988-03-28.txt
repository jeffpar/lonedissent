(1:00 P.M.)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument

now in Number 87-5096, Quincy West versus Samuel Atkins.

5

Mr. Stein, you may proceed whenver you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM STEIN, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR.

STEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9

the Court, the respondent in this case, Dr. Samuel Atkins,

10

was the physician responsible for orthopedic services for

11

some 17,000 prisoners in the North Carolina prison system.

12

The petitioner, Quincy West, was a North Carolina prisoner.

13

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of

14

North Carolina granted the respondent summary judgment and a

15

majority of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth

16

Circuit sitting en banc affirmed,

17

respondent did not act under color of law when he was managing

18

the health services of the petitioner.

19

holding that the

Petitioner's lawsuit brought under 1983 in the

20

Federal District Court was, of course, based on this Court's

21

decision in Estelle against Gamble, where the Court had held

22

that the deliberate denial of serious medical services

23

constituted -- by a prison authority constituted the inflic­

24

tion of cruel and unusual punishment.

25

And of course,

the reason for that is that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

3

1

prisoner is himself helpless to have medical services unless

2

the state provides it, and in North Carolina that is true.

3

A prisoner such as petitioner cannot obtain medical services

4

except for the services given to him by the state.

5

he could afford to hire a doctor, he is not allowed to do so

6

according to North Carolina law.

7

Even if

This then, the case that was brought then was

8

exactly the sort of case that the Court indicated was

9

actionable under 1983 in Estelle.

10

that there was abuse of power by an authority by denying

11

needed medical services, and that it was done by somebody

12

with authority granted by the state to so act.

13

QUESTION:

There were allegations

Mr. Stein, do you take the position that

14

any physican performing services and paid by the state would

15

be liable, in your view, and would constitute state action?

16
17

MR. STEIN:

Justice O'Connor, I would take that

position, but that isn't this case.

18

QUESTION:

It seems to me --

I mean, even a physician serving as a

19

consultant in his own office on a special medical problem?

20

Just so long as he is paid by the state, then it is state

21

action?

22

MR. STEIN:

Well, the argument there would be that

23

under Estelle there is an Eighth Amendment obligation on the

24

state to provide medical services to the prisoner, and that

25

if the state has then selected this physician, that person is

doing the state's work, but it seems to me that Your Honor

2

has described a fact situation on a spectrum of the least

3

involvement of the state presumably up to the position of

4

a medical director who is a regular employee..

5

QUESTION:

I am just wondering what kind of

6

line-drawing we could have legitimately if we adopted your

7

view of the liability here.

8

MR. STEIN:

Well, my view is that there is no

9

line to be drawn,

10

services is a state responsibility, but that isn't my case,

11

and I would like to suggest that the facts in the record

12

show that Dr. Atkins in this case was much more like the

13

person who is in charge of the whole medical system, is a

14

regular employee and always has been.

15

that indeed the provision of medical

What if the North Carolina law were

16

changed, Mr. Stein, and North Carolina allowed prisoners to

17

contract out and find their own doctors .i f they had a par­

18

ticular kind of case, and the state said, we will just pay

19

fo r it?

20

MR. STEIN:

Well, Your Honor, in that circumstance,

21

if the prisoner himself had the choice and the state would

22

pay for all of them, it seems to me that would be a very

23

different case from what we have here.

Carolina and he chose that person rather than the state, it

the carrying out of the punishnent, just as in the

I mean, this is a cause of
Don't you have to

It is our position that the state

11

has assigned to Dr. Atkins the responsibility for deciding

12

what, if any, orthopedic services are to be provided to

13

any of its prisoners.

14

QUESTION:

But that is in no sense the punishment

15

that the state is imposing.

16

medical treatment.

17

MR. STEIN:

They don't sentence you to

Well, the punishment is when the

18

doctor, instead of exercising medical judgment, instead takes

19

an action to prevent the prisoner from getting the medical

20

services that he needs.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, that is malpractice, but I don't

see how it is punishment.
MR. STEIN:

Your Honor, I submit that it is a good

24

deal more than malpractice.

25

Estelle doesn't reach ordinary malpractice.

The distinction in Estelle,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

If a doctor is

6

1

simply exercising professional judgment and does it

2

negligently, that is not an Eighth Amendment violation under

3

Estelle and that is not the understanding.

4

standing and what the courts have held is that one must show

5

an action beyond medical judgment.

6

It is my under­

Indeed, it is our position in this case what

7

happened was that Dr. Atkins in his last examination of the

8

petitioner five months after he had first seen him, saw him

9

in his office, said, your achilJ.es tendon has not yet healed,

10

you may need an operation, but you certainly need continuing,

11

regular orthopedic care from me, and that was the medical

12

judgment he entered, and then immediately upon the petitioner

13

leaving the office he wrote on that day in the medical

14

records, I discharged this man from further orthopedic

15

services, and in fact that order was obeyed, despite other

16

prison people trying to get this man to Dr. Atkins.

17

QUESTION:

I see that that goes beyond

18

negligence, but it is not enough to go beyond negligence.

19

You have to go all the way to punishment, and I don't see

20

how this individual had any responsibility for the

21

administering of the state's punishment.

22

MR. STEIN:

Well, he was given the power to

23

decide whether or not this person would have treatment, just

24

as the guards who are identified in lots of the cases and were

25

identified in the Estelle case, seeing a man needing medical

3

that's the only access to the medical care there is.

4

QUESTION:

It's an infliction of harm, but I don't

1

don't you have to reach somebody who is responsible for

2

executing the sentence upon the individual somehow, someone

3

who is in charge of administering the punishment.

4

MR. STEIN:

Well, it is my understanding it is the

5

fact of incarceration which is the punishment, and that

6

everybody who is within the prison system is -- and is a

7

prison official is connected with administering the punishment

by maintaining the incarceration and by feeding people and so

on.

QUESTION:

You don't say in the municipal area

11

that every agent of the city is the city for purposes of

municipal liability.

We try to reach somebody who establishes

policy for the city.

Why shouldn't it be the same for the

This is not a municipal case or a

or anything, that was found to be state action because he

was acting with the authority that was given.

But when Dr. Atkins spoke and said, my patient won't have

any more orthopedic care because it was in the prison

context that was the end of orthopedic care and indeed

6

although nurses and other health care people and quards and

so on sought to have Mr. West cared for by Atkins, Atkins was

able to enforce the order and never saw him again, and the

MR. STEIN:

Yes, sir.

The allegations were, this

was a pro se complaint. The allegations were that Dr. Atkins

20

was deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of

21

petitioner Quincy West, who had torn his achilles tendon,

22

and it sent on for a period of five months, ending up with

23

the appointment with the examination I described on February

4

then finally he was discharged at a time the doctor himself

was saying, your achilles tendon hasn't healed, you need

further treatment, and we say that is being deliberately

indifferent, purposefully withholding the care that he said

was needed.

plays an important role within the total health care system

and exercises the power to decide what, if any, treatment

QUESTION:

MR. STEIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Why the -- this is a 1983 suit?
Yes, sir.
Why that suit instead of an ordinary

negligence suit?

11

MR. STEIN:

Well, a negligence suit would have been

12

easier probably, Your Honor, but he chose his forum, and he

13

acted for himself and filed a pro se complaint, and I suppose

14

being in the custody of the State of North Carolina he was

15

looking to the federal court for the vindication of his

16

federal rights, but that was his decision, and that is what

17

he did.

18
19

QUESTION:

But there would have been -- a negli­

gence suit wasn't barred, was it?

20

MR. STEIN:

My understanding of North Carolina

21

law is that he could have filed a negligence suit in state

22

court.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. STEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Who could he have sued?
Well, he could have sued the doctor.
How about the prison?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Anybody in

14

1

the prison?

2

MR. STEIN: Well, he could have sought to bring

3

an action under the State Tort Claims Act, which is a

4

procedure that is administered by the Industrial Commission,

5

and it is heard before a deputy commissioner.

6

the Fourth Circuit's decision in Calvert against Sharp came

7

down the state started taking the position in the Industrial

8

Commission that doctors such as Dr. Atkins weren't state

9

employees, and therefore you couldn't proceed there.

10

QUESTION:

I see.

However, once

Do you understand the Court

11

of Appeals to have held that there is no state action even

12

if a doctor is an employee of the prison?

13

MR. STEIN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEIN:

17

QUESTION:

19

It covers any doctor in or out of the

prison system.

16

18

That is my understanding.

That's my reading of this —Would not be exercising any state

action.
MR. STEIN:

And of course it based its decision

20

on its reading of this Court's rulings in Polk County against

21

Dodson, where there was language in there and some discussion

22

of a public defender's professional obligations which would

23

cause that public defender to be independent, and --

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Stein, I can understand your

response to Justice White, but is the Fourth Circuit theory

really so apparent?

2

Calvert case, and the Calvert case had to do largely with

3

part-time performance, didn't it?

4

MR. STEIN:

One can argue that they relied on the

Well, it did, but the language in

5

this case, and emphasized a couple times, is that whenever

6

a professional is acting within the bounds of his professional

7

discretion, he does not act under color of state law.

8

QUESTION:

That certainly is in the opinion, but

9

also the great emphasis on Calvert makes me wonder really

10

what their basic theory was.

11

argument by the Fourth Circuit.

12

MR. STEIN:

I don't get consistency in

Well, we have seen recently some

13

unpublished opinions from the Fourth Circuit where we find

14

that if a doctor, a prison doctor is named in the suit, he

15

is -- it is -- the broad language is cited, and the case is

16

dismissed.

17
18
19
20

I think that is the understanding of that court.
QUESTION:

On that basis there would never be

a recovery.
MR. STEIN:

There would never be a recovery

against the doctor.

22

MR. STEIN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. STEIN: Under federal law.

25

Against the person.
Against the person.
Under federal law.
That's right,

we submit, of course, that the Fourth Circuit got the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

16

1

language of professionalism in Polk County wrong, that what

2

was important in the Polk County case in terms of the

3

professional obligations of the public defender was her

4

professional obligation to be not only independent but to be

5

adversarial to the state.

6

In fact, the Dodson case, it was litigation where

7

the plaintiff was the State of Iowa, State of Iowa against

8

Dodson, and one looks at that and sees that the police have

9

investigated and preferred charges in the state through its

10

state's attorney.

11

And then look on the defendant's side of the table and see

12

it's against Mr. Dodson, and there is his counsel.

13

those circumstances, aid I think that the court said in the

14

peculiar circumstances of the case the state employee was not

15

said to be acting under color of state law.

16

The district attorney is prosecuting it.

And in

I would point out that even in that courtroom or

17

in the context of that the lawyer representing the state was

21

Nothing has disturbed the court's rulinas

So was the judge, or the judges.

I think it was

After Polk County against Dodson, we have the

22

Glover case, where a public defender was sued, and he was

23

found to be acting under color of state law because of his

24

acting in concert and conspiracy with the prosecutor and the

25

judge and other state officials, so that the professionalism

of the judge and the professionalism of the prosecutor

didn't cause them not to be state actors.

4

I would note that when a public defender acts in a case

5

of a criminal defense lawyer, he is always acting before the

6

courts, and judges have a responsibility if they see something

wrong going on to act.

8

frequency complain about their lawyers, and if the complaint

9

has some merit, the judges will act.

It seems to me that

any merit in it, where there is -- in a criminal defense

counterpart in the prison system short of litigation.

3

It just doesn't have its

I would also emphasize in terms of the

4

professionalism idea that there are lots of cases from this

5

Court where professionals have been found to be acting

6

under color of state law.

7

the act of exercising a professional judgment was found

8

itself to be the state action, and if the actor exceeded the

9

bounds of accepted professional judgment in that instance

10

of providing certain care to a mentally retarded person

11

incarcerated in a state institution, that would be actionable

12

under 1983.

13

We cited the Younqberg case, where

I would mention briefly the Blum case, which was

14

the case involving concededly private physicians and con-

15

cededly private nursing homes in New York, which is very

16

much in contrast with the setting we have, which is in the

17

Central Prison, behind walls, a core -- medical care being

18

a core function, of the responsibilities of the state in

19

providing prison services.

20

And I would like also to mention that we are here

21

construing the Civil Rights Act of 1871 that this Court has

22

often told us was intended to provide remedies as broad as

23

the 14th Amendment, and I certainly do submit that on the

24

facts of this case it seems inconceivable to me that Congress

25

couldn't draw a statute to allow petitioner to bring a
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

19

lawsuit against this doctor for the things that he said

2

were done.

3

And finally, I would say to the Court that

4

Estelle and the cases that have followed it have identified

5

in the prison system serious problems in medical care in

6

prisons, reaching constitutional dimensions, but the course

7

of that litigation has substantially improved health care

8

in the prison systems, and the'two fine amicus briefs that

9

were filed in this case by the ACLU and the American Public

10

Health Association show that, and I submit that the Court of

11

Appeals decision here in effect cuts Estelle in half, takes

12

the doctors out as potential litigants, and would damage

13

substantially the progress that has been made and turn us

14

in the wrong direction.

15
16

If there are no further questions, I will reserve
my remaining time.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

18

We will hear now from you, Mr. Safron.

19

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESOUIRE

20
21

Thank you, Mr. Stein.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SAFRON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

22

the Court, we are not here to argue Estelle versus Gamble,

23

nor are we here to deny the fact that an inmate may sue a

24

doctor in state court under conventional tort liability.

25

What we are arguing is that a physician in a

situation such as Dr. Atkins in this case does not function

2

under color of state law so as to satisfy the jurisdictional

3

requirement of the Civil Rights Act.
Nov/, in this particular case, Mr. West was playing

4

S

volleyball on July 30th, 1983, at the Odom Correctional

6

Institution.

7

saw the physician at the unit, and was referred to the

8

orthopedic clinic at Central Prison Hospital , where on

9

August the 9th, 1983, he was presented to Dr. Atkins, who was

10

the orthopedic surgeon conducting that particular clinic.

11

He injured his .left leg while playing volleyball

There are a number of clinics at Central Prison

12

Hospital.

13

There are 130 physicians under contract with the State of

14

North Carolina excluding dentists and psychiatrists.

15

We also have another hopsital, McCain Hospital.

For the fiscal year ending June 30t.h, 1987, the

16

State of North Carolina spent $23,345,000 in providing

17

medical care to inmates.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Safron, let me ask the converse

19

of Justice O'Connor's question of your opponent.

20

conceive of any factual situation where a physician is liable?

21

MR. SAFRON:

Do you

Under Estelle, if we have an admini­

22

strator, but we would deny that under these facts that

23

Dr. Atkins was an administrator. Althouqh he may have given

24

medical orders to medical staff, we deny that he is an

25

adminstrator.

He is not responsible for running the prison.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

He may give orders to a nurse.

2

QUESTION:

Now, in this situation --

So even if he is employed full-time

3

and exclusively by the state to render medical care to the

4

prisoners, you take the position no liability.

5

MR. SAFRON:

I would take the same position that

6

the en banc opinion of the Fourth Circuit did, Justice

7

O'Connor, that if he is a doctor, performing medicine, and

8

is not an administrator, that he is not functioning under

9

color of state law merely because he is a physician employed

10

by the state to provide medical services.

11

QUESTION:

Well, what if the prison hired on a

12

contract basis prison guards, all of whom are licensed under

13

some state licensing scheme to make them professionals?

14

MR. SAFRON:

19

Only the state can arrest, except of course, there is

22

Providing medical care, I would submit, is not state action.

I'd say this.

I am certainly not denying that.

The state also has

23

QUESTION:

1

Excuse me.

So you are abandoning the

2

professional requirement, unless you consider serving food

3

to be a profession.
MR. SAFRON:

4

No, certainly not.

Under the facts

5

of this case there is the professional requirement, but if we

6

are moving from that, I would say that color of state law is

7

what is coming into play, and that color of state law could

8

in fact be really unavailable in other situations, serving

9

food, providing heat.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Stein, getting back to Justice

11

O'Connor's question, you kind of left off between the guard

12

and the doctor as to the difference under the color of state

13

law.

What is the difference under color of state law?

14

MR. SAFRON:

Justice Marshall, I would say this.

15

A doctor is a doctor because he is licensed by a medical

16

authority.

17

he is hired to be a guard.

A guard can only be a guard in a prison because

I thought in response to

I would argue that he is still the

I had thought your point was that he

was a state actor but was not a state actor for the purpose

of imposing punishment, and that's all that the Eighth

Amendment covers, and therefore he can't be a state actor.

violations, but not for the cruel and unusual punishment

MR. SAFRON:

The very fact that you are here

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

5

MR. STEIN:

6

Two points about Estelle.

Thank you, Mr. Pafron.

Thank you, Chief Justice.
The first is that the

7

doctor in Estelle was sued for what he did as a physician,

8

not what he did as an administrator.

9

of Estelle that the failure to provide medical care that

10

results in unnecessary suffering is punishment, and this —

11

QUESTION:

And it is our reading

Mr. Stein, you can't mean that.

12

Suppose a state adopts a state Medicare system that all

13

medical services will be provided to the general copulation

14

at state expense, and you get a physician who does what this

15

physician is alleged to have done here, intentionally

16

withholds care.

cruel and unusual punishment?

Would that be an Eighth Amendment claim for

MR. STEIN:

No, because -- for several reasons.

The general citizenry aren't incarcerated.

All right, so you don't mean that

21

simply the denial of medical care is in itself cruel and

unusual punishment.

as in this case, by withholding, by denying it himself, he

is denying it altogether, which is not true in the free world.

3

QUESTION:

So in the example I just gave you,

4

if a doctor treated somebody in the general population and

5

intentionally withheld care, that would not be an Eighth

are we?

We are concerned with the statutory issue of 1983.

to treat the statutory issue first rather than the
