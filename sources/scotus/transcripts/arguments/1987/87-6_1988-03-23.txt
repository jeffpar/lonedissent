ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON FERRIS, ESQUIRE

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. FERRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

16

may it please the Court, this case is here on Mr.

17

Huddleston's petition for certiorari to the United States

18

Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

19

major issues facing this Court in this case.

20

There are two

First, by what standard of proof must the govern­

21

ment prove that the defendant engaged in a prior bad act

22

before it may be admitted under Federal Rules of Evidence

23

404(b).

24

admitted, which harmless error test should govern on

25

appellate review, the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt

And second, if such evidence is erroneously

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

1

test enunciated by this Court in Chapman or the effect

2

on substantial rights test enunciated by this Court in

3

Kotteakos?

4

Finally, once this Court decides which standards

5

should be adopted in this case, the Court must apply them

6

to the facts of this case.

7

Now, petitioner contends that the trial court

8

abused its discretion in admitting petitioner's involvement

9

in the sale of black and white televisions prior to the

10

sale of VHF tapes which he was charged with when the

11

government did not prove they were stolen by at least a

12

preponderance of the evidence.

13

We also contend that the jury's hearing about

14

these TVs was not harmless error, that it affected his

15

substantial rights and amounted to a miscarriage of justice

16

under the Kotteakos standard.

17
18

I will concentrate in my argument on the standard
of proof question, contending that both rules 104(a) and

19

(b) of the federal rules require that the government show

20

that the prior bad act was committed and that the defendant

21

committed it by a preponderance of the evidence.

22

Then I intend to show that the government did not

23

meet this standard in this case, that they did not show by

24

a preponderance of the evidence that these TVs were stolen

25

or that the defendant knew about it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

And finally I will argue that the erroneous

2

introduction of the TVs was not harmless, that it did

3

affect his substantial rights.

4

Now, this Court is faced in our briefs with

5

deciding between three different standards of proof.

6

of all, the clear and convincing standard of proof which

7

was adopted by the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits.

8

Many federal commentators also support it, as did our

9

position, the federal common law.

10

First,

The preponderance of evidence test has been

11

supported by six different circuits, using the 104(b) test,

12

and if this case is analyzed also under 104(a) I believe

13

that this would be the required holding of the Court under

14

the recent case of Bourjaily, and if I am not pronouncing

15

that correctly -- I believe the case is Bourjaily, and that

16

was decided by this Court last summer.

17

The government argues for a different standard.

18

The government argues that a trial court should admit this

19

evidence when there is a basis for finding that the

20

defendant committed the Act.

21

is absolutely no support for that --

22

QUESTION:

It is our position that there

Well, there is certainly a great deal

23

of support for it in the traditional common law of

24

evidence.

25

to the jury, but the trial judqe admits evidence on the

Traditionally your burden of proof is a charge

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

1

basis of whether it tends -- whether a reasonable person

2

could find that it tended to prove some element of the case.

3

MR. FERRIS:

I believe -- I would aqree with

4

that but there stands as a sentinel to deciding this Rule

5

104(a) or (b), whichever one applies.

6

QUESTION:

Now, where do we find the text of

7

104 (a) in your brief?

8

say the rule of evidence

9

10 4 (b) .

10

MR. FERRIS:

11

QUESTION:

12

involved, but you cite only

I cite it -I mean, you set it out -- you set out

only 104(b).

13
14

In your petition for certiorari you

MR. FERRIS:

That's correct,., and in my brief I

cite 104(a) many times.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FERRIS:

17

QUESTION: Again in your brief at the beginning you

And is the text in your brief?
Yes, I believe it is.

18

say the rule of evidence involved, and you set forth only

19

104 (b) .

20

MR. FERRIS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. FERRIS:

23
24
25

I actually set 404(b).
404(b).
404(b).

But I argue numerous times

in my brief that whichever applies, 104(a) or 104(b), that —
QUESTION:

Are these the same — is 104(a) and

104(b) the same thing as 404(a) and 404(b)?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

MR. FERRIS:

No, 104(a) provides that

2

preliminary questions on the admissibility of evidence

3

must be decided by the Court.

QUESTION:

7

brief if you are qoing to rely on them?
MR. FERRIS:

I believe -- 104(b) is specifically

stated in the brief.

8

QUESTION:

9

(Pause.)

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FERRIS:

12

Why aren't these set forth in your

Whereabouts?

Well, continue your argument.
They are set out in Footnote 17

on Page 24 of the brief.

13

QUESTION:

14

And you are relying both on 104(a) and 104 (b)?

15

MR. FERRIS:

Thank you.

104(a) and 104(b).

That's correct.

In

16

104(a),"preliminary questions concerning the admissibility

17

of evidence shall be determined by the courts, subject to

18

the provisions of subdivision (b)." and (b) is relevancy

19

conditioned on fact. "When the relevancy of evidence

20

depends.on the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court

21

shall admit it upon the introduction of evidence sufficient

22

to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition."

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that the traditional trial

judqe's saying the proponent offers in evidence and says,
I will connect it up later?

In other words, there is

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7
1

something that should be in evidence that isn't to make it

2

completely — to make it admissible, and the trial judge

3

says, yes, but you will have to connect it up later.

4

MR. FERRIS: No --

5

QUESTION:

6

of proof.

7

8

That doesn't deal with a standard

MR. FERRIS:

Six Circuit Courts of Appeal have

held that it does.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. FERRIS:

You tell me why you think it does.
I think that it does because similar

11

acts evidence is so fraught with possible prejudice to the

12

defendant that that should be decided by the courts outside

13

of the presence of the jury, and it has no probative

14

value --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

But we don't get that surely out of

Rule 101(b) or 104(b).
MR. FERRIS:

104(b), I believe that introduction

18

of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfill­

19

ment of a condition equals a preponderance of the evidence.

20

QUESTION:

I don't think so at all.

21

QUESTION:

I don't see how you can say that.

22

QUESTION:

Sufficient to support a finding is

23

quite different.

24

he shall admit it if he finds.that the evidence is

25

sufficient.

If it had meant that it would have said,

It doesn't say, if he finds.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It said sufficient

to support a finding, which is exactly the common law rule

the Chief Justice is referring to.

4

making the judgment.

5

simply a reasonable man could find that.

6

Could a reasonable jury
Preponderance is his

Sufficient to support a finding is

MR. FERRIS:

It is our position that it must be --

7

that the court must decide that out of the presence of the

8

jury by at least a preponderance of the evidence or it has

9

no probative value, that the jury should not hear about it,

10

that if you then say to the jury, well, just ignore this

11

later, ignore that we have said that this man is a bad man,

12

that that is not effective, that this should be held outside

13

of the presence of the jury, as this Court recognized in

14

deciding the conspiracy issue in Bourjaily under 104(a).

15

QUESTION:

I understand that that is your

16

position.

17

language of 104(b), which only requires evidence sufficient

18

to support a finding.

19

I just don't see how you get it from the

QUESTION:

If you want to talk about damaging

20

evidence, suppose there is eyewitness testimony offered.

21

witness is called.

22

saw him.

23

rather damaging, isn't it, and yet you don't let the trial

24

judge try out that issue, whether that is reliable testimony

25

or not, before it goes to the jury.

The

The government calls the witness, and he

MR. FERRIS:

But that is on the substantive

offense.

in the federal common law.

5

in 1896 followed the exclusionary rule as to similar acts

6

evidence.

7

Here you are talking about evidence that is
It has always been disfavored by the courts

QUESTION:

This Court in the Boyd case back

Well, you could certainly -- I suppose

8

the defendant is perfectly entitled to put on other

9

evidence that he didn't commit these acts and let the jury

10

decide it.

11

MR. FERRIS:

He could do that, but

it is our

12

position that it doesn't have sufficient probative value

13

to go to the jury unless you prove by at least 51 percent of

14

the evidence that the defendant committed the act, that it

15

is too fraught with prejudice otherwise to be admitted.

16

QUESTION:

But you are saying the judge has to

17

decide that.

18

the prior bad act occurred.

19

Suppose there is a dispute over whether or not

MR. FERRIS:

Then that should be held outside of

20

the presence of the jury.

21

generally does not take that long.

22

QUESTION:

From a practical standpoint, it

Suppose there is an offer of proof

23

that the prior bad act did occur, and the defense counsel

24

says, we are going to argue that it didn't.

25

to the jury?

The court doesn't hear that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Doesn't that go

10

1

MR. FERRIS:

If the court finds -- it is our

2

position that if the court finds that that had been proven

3

by a preponderance of the evidence, by 51 percent of the

4

evidence, so that it is probative, then yes, then it goes

5

to the jury.

6

dispute that, and I would state I don't believe —

7

Then the defendant can get on the stand and

QUESTION:

8

voluntary confession.

9

MR. FERRIS:

10

QUESTION:

11

12
13

You say it is the same rule as with a

Yes.
The court first decides whether it is

a voluntary confession, and then the jury decides it again.
MR. FERRIS:

Yes, and our position is that

it comes out of Rule 104(a).

14

QUESTION:

IS

MR. FERRIS:

16

QUESTION:

Can you get that out of the evidence?
Pardon?
But this isn't -- is that just because

17

of the highly dangerous nature of this evidence in your

18

view, because 3.04(a) doesn't make that distinction.

19

MR. FERRIS:

It is -- questions concerning the

20

admissibility of evidence, and I would agree with

21

Professor Wright, who indicates that if you are talking

22

about whether a prior bad act is a bad act, that that is a

23

preliminary ouestion that should be decided by the judge,

24

that that isn't a preliminary question of fact, that the

25

government is introducing it for the purpose of showing that

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

11

2
3

the bad act occurred.
QUESTION:

And what provision of the rules did

Professor Wright rely on to reach his opinion?

4

MR. FERRIS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FERRIS:

7

QUESTION:

8

at all, so far as I can tell.

9

104(a).
104(a)?
Right.
Which simply doesn't address the point

MR. FERRIS: He reads 104(a) and 104(b) as a whole,

10

and because of the possible prejudice and because it is

11

fraught with danger, that he argues and I argue that as do

12

the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits, and as do

13

every circuit court in this country —

14

QUESTION:

Well, did they have some reasoning

15

that hasn't so far been apparent from your argument?

16

mean, do they simply rely on the lanauage that we have

17

been talking about, 104(a) and (b)?

18

MR. FERRIS:

I

Yes, they equate that with

19

preponderance of the evidence.

20

case is, the government relied on the First Circuit in

21

developing their any basis test under a case called D'Alora,

22

and since we wrote our initial briefs, the First Circuit

23

came down with a case called Ingraham at 832 Fed 2d. that

24

also follows the Second, Fourth, Fifth, all of the other

25

circuits that have developed a preponderance of evidence

In fact, the most recent

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

12

1

Standard, and they all rely on 104(b).

2

lanquage, introduction of evidence sufficient to support

3

a finding of the fulfillment of a condition, equals a

4

preponderance of the evidence, and that's our position.

5

6

QUESTION:

I thought you argued for a clear and

convincing standard.

7

MR. FERRIS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

They say that that

I did argue for a —
Your argument is so different than that

which I thought we were hearing from the brief.
MR. FERRIS:

It is.

I argued clear and convincing

11

in my petition, and I was unaware -- in fact, my petition

12

for cert was in the: mail when this Court issued its opinion

13

in Bourjaily, and I was not aware of Bourjaily when I wrote

14

my initial brief.

15

Bourjaily -- that this Court held in Bourjaily that the

16

104(a) standard, which had never been ruled on before

17

because it doesn't state -- nowhere in the Federal Rules

18

do they state what the burden of proof should be.

19
20

But in my reply brief I admit that

QUESTION:

Well, you no longer are asking us to

require a clear and convincing standard then?

21

MR. FERRIS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FERRIS:

I am no longer asking that.
All right.
I am no

24

because I don't think that --

25

QUESTION:

longer asking that,

And so I thought the Sixth Circuit

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13

1

2
3
4
5

6

applied some preponderance of the evidence there.
MR. FERRIS:

They did on their second --- on

rehearing they did apply the preponderance of evidence.
QUESTION:

So you are saying the judgment should

be affirmed, I suppose.
MR. FERRIS:

No, I'm saying that the Sixth

7

Circuit also was incorrect in their application of the

8

preponderance of evidence standard.

9
10

QUESTION:

MR. FERRIS:

12

QUESTION:

14

That there was not enouah evidence

that they could have found a preponderance standard?

11

13

I don't --

Yes.
And that's what your argument boils

down to now?
MR. FERRIS:

Well, it is also — I'm taking the

15

position for a preponderance of the evidence, because I

16

believe that the government's position of any basis would

17

be disastrous to criminal defendants, that the government

18

could come in with flimsy similar acts evidence and say

19

this evidence should come in, and then only using the 403 --

20

the government argues for a 403 balancing test.

21

QUESTION:

Well, let's talk about Rule 403.

22

Doesn't Rule 403 require the court to determine whether

23

the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs --

24

MR. FERRIS:

25

QUESTION:

The probative value.
-- the probative value.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

14

1

MR. FERRIS:

403 specifically states that the

2

evidence comes in unless the prejudicial effects substantially

3

outweighs the probative value, which I find very different

4

than a straight probative prejudice balancing.

5

QUESTION:

Right, but was there any objection

6

raised below to the Court's treatment of Rule 403 and that

7

balancing?

8

MR. FERRIS:

9

on Joint Appendix 6 did object.

10

below.

11

12

There was -- yes, the defense counsel
There was no balancing

In fact -QUESTION:

Well, but that is not a question

presented on certiorari to us, is it, the 403 balancing?

13

MR. FERRIS:

The 403 only is from a standpoint is

14

if -- the government is arguing that that is what the

15

standard should be, is no standard, just 403.

16

QUESTION:

All right, but you did not raise some

17

improper application of 403 in the petition for

18

certiorari, did you?

19

MR. FERRIS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FERRIS:

22

That's correct.
Okay.
That's correct.

I did discuss 403

because I felt that the government would raise 403.
QUESTION:

23

Well, do you think the strength of

24

the evidence must be considered in the 403 balancing or

25

not?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15

1

MR. FERRIS:

I think that the first -- I think that

2

it does, but I think that the first step that must be done is

3

that you don't reach the 403 balancing until you decide that

4

there has -- that the similar act has been proven by a

5

preponderance of the evidence.

6

QUESTION:

So you think the trial judge has to

7

make a separate determination of whether the similar acts

8

are established by a preponderance --

9

MR. FERRIS:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.
-- before letting it go to the jury and

11

then make another assessment of the strength of the evidence

12

under 403.

13

MR. FERRIS:

Yes, the steps that I have argued

14

for, and I argue this in my reply brief specifically, is

15

that first the evidence has to be shown to be admitted

16

for a proper purpose, not for propensity, but for one

17

of the proper purposes under Rule 404 (b) .

18

Second, that has to be at issue.

Now, those

19

two things were argued in this case, that it was beinq

20

admitted for knowledge and the defendant admitted that the

21

issue in this case was going to be knowledge.

22

position is that in this case, where there is a dispute as

23

to whether the bad act occurred or whether the bad act was

24

a bad act, whether the TVs were stolen, then the court has

25

to show that -- it has to be shown to the court by a

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Then my

16

1

preponderance of the evidence, and once that threshold is

2

met, then he applies the prejudice versus probative value.

3

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge finds that a

4

reasonable trier of fact could find by a preponderance of

5

the evidence that the bad act occurred but he doesn't think

6

it did.

Then what?

7

MR. FERRIS:

I think that your standard is

8

the correct one, reasonable.

9

same standard that you would use --

10
11

QUESTION:

Reasonable.

That is the

My question is what -- then does it

still go to the trier of fact, to the jury?

12

MR. FERRIS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, it goes to the trier of fact.
So that he doesn't have to ntkke

14

a finding.

15

evidence from which a jury might make the determination.

16
17

All he has to find is that there is sufficient

MR. FERRIS:

And that is 51 percent of the

evidence.

18

QUESTION:

May I ask --

19

QUESTION:

But he doesn't have to make a finding.

20

MR. FERRIS:

He has to determine that a trier of

21

fact could make that finding, yes, that a reasonable perso

22

could make a finding of 51 percent of the evidence.

23

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about the bad

24

act in this case, the sale of the television sets?

25

your view that the bad act that must be proven by a
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Is it

17

1

preponderance of the evidence is that, A, the televisions

2

were sold for a very low price, B, they were stolen, and C,

3

he knew they were stolen?

4

of those elements by a preponderance of the evidence?

5

the government admitted at oral argument in the Sixth

standard than that.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Ferris, I assume that your argument

7

would apply to everything covered by 404(b), and therefore

8

I am a little concerned about using the shorthand "bad

9

evidence."

10

MR. FERRIS:

11

QUESTION:

Right.
It isn't all bad.

You say this stuff

12

is so inherently inflammatory there has been a common law

13

bias against it, but it isn't -- if what you are trying to

14

show is that this individual committed burglary ten times

15

before, I suppose you could call that bad evidence, but

16

it wouldn't necessarily be that.

17

All you would have to show, let's say, in a case

18

where there has been a theft from a store, you might just

19

want to show that in the preceding ten weeks there had been

20

similar items missing from the store, and on the day those

21

items were missing, every one of those days this individual

22

happened to be in the store.

23

I don't think there's anything inflammatory about

24

the fact that this individual was in the store once a week

Right, if it is pigeonholed under

24

go into part of the res gestae, which is -- the government

25

argued in their brief as a fallback position that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

1

shouldn't even be analyzed' under a similar act evidence,

2

that these TVs should come in because it showed that Mr.

3

Huddleston was -- if these TVs were not stolen, if this

4

Court adopts a standard of the preponderance of the evidence,

5

that if these TVs were not shown to be stolen by a pre­

6

ponderance of the evidence, that they should have come in

7

anyway, because it shows that Mr. Huddleston had a habit, not

8

a habit, but had been selling things throughout the State of

9

Michigan that were of questionable character.

10

That was their fallback position, and I think at

11

some point you get into a res gestae, and you don't' have to

12

analyze it.

13

That argument was first raised before this Court as a

14

fallback position.

IS

I don't think that that is before this Court.

The only way to -- I believe that this is a con-)

16

17

decided by the judge, and as a result

into play, and that stands as a sentinel, in the words

19

of the judge who wrote Ingraham, which reversed the

20

government's argument.

that 104(b) comes

21

Again I indicate that the First Circuit was the

22

only circuit to follow the government's position, and all

23

the other circuits have indicated that 104 should be the

24

standard, that it has not been shown in this case when all

25

the government can show is that these TVs were beincr sold

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23

1

for $28, and in fact if you use all of the evidence there

2

was an attorney licensed to practice in the State of

3

Michigan who said he had a bill of sale for these TVs and

4

sold them right out of his store.

5

The last issue is that if this Court agrees with

6

my analysis and also agrees that there was not a prepon­

7

derance of the evidence, then you have to reach the harmless

8

error standard, and I would admit to the Court that this

9

Court has never held that the harmless error standard in

10

nonconstitutional claims, and I am not claiming that this

11

is a nonconstitutional claim, should be by the Chapman rule,

12

should be by harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

13

Circuit applied both standards in their opinions.

14

said, in the first opinion, a two-one decision reversing

15

Mr. Huddleston's conviction, they said that it hadn't been

16

proven -- that it hadn't been proven harmless beyond a

17

reasonable doubt, and then they also said, though, that

18

there was some question as to whether there was a sufficient

19

objecion raised here, and they analyzed the case under a

20

plain error standard under Rule 52(b) , which I take the

21

position that the plain error standard is the same

22

as the Kotteakos standard.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQUIRE

12
13

Thank you, Mr. Ferris.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

14

the Court, our position in this case is very simple.

15

that Rule 404(b) does one thing and one thing only.

16

prohibits the use of similar act, what we are calling

17

similar act evidence for the purpose of showing propensity.

18

That is to say, it prevents the government in a criminal

19

case from using similar act evidence to show that a person

20

is a bad man, and then asking the jury to draw the inference

21

from the fact that he is a bad man that he did the bad acts

22

that are charged in the indictment.

23

It is
It

As we read the rule, once the judge has performed

24

that act of screening, once the judge has said, this may not

25

be used for propensity, then that evidence is treated just

the same as any other evidence that comes before the Court

2

for admission to the jury under a relevance standard.

QUESTION:

I mean, the court might have had a little

on the balancing in this case, I would think, in

3

light of the fact that there isn't much to show knowledge

that the televisions were stolen, is there?
MR. BRYSON:

5

Well, Your Honor, I think there is

6

enough to justify a jury in concluding that they are stolen,

7

and we make the point in the brief.
QUESTION:

8
9

How so?

Why don't you run through that

with us?
MR. BRYSON:

10

Well, sure.

The way we view the

■

11

question of relevance in this case on the television sets is

12

that, Number One, these were sets that were sold in a barroom,

13

basically.

14

into a barroom and saving, are you interested in television

15

sets.

16

announced that he had a truckload of television sets.

17

this wasn't a case of somebody trying to get rid of the

18

television set that wouldn't work at hoitne and trying to bring

19

the television set into a barroom and see if he could get

20

rid of it.

21

The initial contact was made by somebody walking

Number Two, this was a case of someone who had
Now,

The televisions were being sold for an extremely

22

low price, $28 for a 12-inch black and white television, and

23

in fact the evidence from the defense, whch

24

of this lawyer who participated in the sale of other

25

televisions was that the defendants paid a total of, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

was the evidence

28

1

his claim, paid a total of about $10,000 to $12,000 for

2

the whole truckload of televisions, which works out to be

3

about $13 to $16 for each set, so the combination of the

4

price, the circumstances of the sale, and the volume are,

5

we think, sufficient evidence just standing by themselves to

6

justify the inference on the part of the jury that these were

7

stolen television sets, and then if you add to that the

8

fact that in other instances Mr. Huddleston was dealing with

9

the same people in part of the same operation with goods that

10

he admitted to the FBI agent were hot, then that makes a very

11

convincing case to go to the jury, we think, on the question

12

of whether they were in fact stolen.

13

Now, our backup position, of course, is that

14

it isn't necessary to establish that these televisions were

15

stolen in order for that evidence to be admissible, and this

16

was an argument that was made in fact in the closing

17

argument in the rebuttal summation.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

But the jury, the jury is going to have

to find that they were stolen.
MR. BRYSON:

I don't think it would have to make

21

that finding, Your Honor, because suppose the jury

22

concluded, we just don't think they were stolen.

23

evidence doesn't fall out because of that, because they

24

could still find, well, but what it does show, what this

25

other evidence does show is that Mr. Huddleston was in an

The

29

operation that was much larger.

2

QUESTION:

So you don't think in the Court of

3

Appeals then it should even have been open to argue that

4

there was not enough evidence for any reasonable jury to

5

find by a preponderance of the evidence that the televisions

6

were stolen?

7

MR. BRYSON:

Well, we think that would be open

8

to argue that if the Court concluded that the other theory

9

of relevance, our backup theory of relevance was inapplicable,

10

but — in other words, the Court could —

11

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but you say it is

12

admissible without any prior decision by a judge if it is

13

relevant.

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

That's right.
Now, if you are right in that regard

16

you have no business argument the sufficiency of the

17

evidence as to whether the goods were stolen on appeal,

18

right?

19

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, there are two

20

different issues, I think, if I can sort them out, because

21

I think they get resolved in a sliqhtly different way.

is that the evidence has to be ultimately tied up.

I thought, was that at this point you asked the judcre to

No, Your Honor, not -- and this is

13

where we differ from petitioner. We are not asking the judcre

14

to make a preponderance finding or any other standing.

15

are asking that the judge do what the judge does in the

16

case of every piece of evidence that is challenged on

relevance grounds, which is to ask, could the jury make

this finding?

that they were stolen isn't necessary to do.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, before you qo into this

3

alternative theory of relevance, let me just be sure I

4

understand your position on the conditional relevance. Is it

5

not correct in your view that whether the standard is measurin

6

probative value versus prejudice or whether it is some kind

7

of a tentative preponderance finding, that the judcre might

8

admit it at the time it is offered subject to hearing what

9

else is offered on that same issue, whether it is for tying

10

up, as the Chief Justice says, or for making an appropriate

11

judgment on this balancing business, and that if he determines

12

later on, well, they never did offer anything else, then he

13

would instruct the jury to disregard it.

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

That is correct.
So it is conditional at least to that

extent --

17

MR. BRYSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

Isn't that correct?

That's correct.
— even if it is just a balancincr

process.

20

MR. BRYSON:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct, and —
So you agree -- I want to be perfectly

22

clear about it -- you agree that on the theory that they were

23

trying to prove the television sets were stolen, that that

24

104(b) does apply.

25

MR. BRYSON:

Oh, yes, on that theory, and we

say so in the last footnote in our brief.
QUESTION:

2

All right.

Now I am very much

3

interested in your explanation of why it is relevant even

4

if they are not stolen.
MR. BRYSON:

5

Because the testimony -- the way the

6

testimony came in in this case, we had. first the witness who

7

testified about the actual sales of the tapes, and she

8

testified that Mr. Huddleston said he had not only these

9

tapes but also had some movies that he was trying to sell in

10

the meantime.

11

witness with respect to the black and white TVs, and he

12

testified that not only did Mr. Huddleston try to sell the

13

black and white TVs but he also tried to sell the blank

14

tapes that -- obviously, the tapes that were at issue in this

15

case .

16

The second witness who testified was the

And then the third witness, who is the one that

17

testified about Mr. Huddleston's dealings a week after the

18

transactions in this case testified that Mr. Huddleston was

19

trying to get rid of not only the Amana refrigerators but

20

also was trying to get rid of the movies and also was trying

21

to get rid of some color TVs.

22

What the jury could conclude from all of this

23

guite without regard to whether any of this stuff other

24

than the stuff that was at issue in the case was stolen, was

25

that Mr. Huddleston's role in this entire operation was a

much more extensive role than he claimed at trial.

His

claim at trial was basically -- his defense was, how could
I know that this material was stolen, these tapes were
stolen, because my role was so limited, all I was doing was,
I was making the contact.
QUESTION:

In oher

words, you are claiming it

is impeachment? It is just impeachment?

I am talking about

just the government's affirmative case.
MR. BRYSON: Your honor, that is not -QUESTION:

You put it in before he testified,

didn't you?
MR. BRYSON:

You bet, and that is not just

impeachment because his whole defense was lack of knowledge
on the basis of having so little contact with this material
that he had no -QUESTION:

So little contact with the tapes.

MR. BRYSON: Well, that's right, but our point is
that if has contact with the same people, the same operation
over an extended period of time, he is much more intearally
involved in that operation, and therefore much -QUESTION:

Yes, but if three out of the four

products, there is no evidence they are stolen, how does that
tend to prove that he knew the fourth product was stolen?
MR. BRYSON: Because he knows

he is much more

integrally involved with the operation and therefore

36

he is much more
QUESTION:

2

Well, Sears Roebuck sells 400 items

3

and then because it is a big operation and they happen to

4

have one stolen item that makes them know that one stolen

5

item?

I don't understand.
MR. BRYSON:

6

Because he is running operation or

7

plaving a very major role in the operation, the jury could

8

infer that his defense, which is that he had so little

9

contact he had no reason to inquire, he was just doing a

10

favor for a friend just doesn't wash.

11

somebody who is in a position of running the operation is

12

going to be likely to know much more about the quality of

13

the goods than somebody who is just doing a favor by making

14

a contact.

15

doesn't depend on whether those TVs were stolen.

16

In other words,

That's the second theory of relevance, which

Now, we think that the inference of knowledge

17

from the fact that they were stolen, from the conclusion

18

that they were stolen is a powerful inference, and we don't

19

need to rely on the second theory, but I think the second

20

theory would certainly justify the judge in letting the

21

evidence in, and in fact the prosecutor argued to the jury

22

that one reason you can conclude that this evidence is

23

pertinent is because It tends to rebut his claim that he was

24

so busy with his contracting business that he really just

25

relegated to a small part of his attention the business of

37

selling these tapes, and the prosecutor explained, he was

2

doing this, he was spending a lot of time and effort on

3

this entire operation.

4

a by the way accommodation by making a couple of phone calls

5

for somebody, and from that we can infer an opportunity to

6

have much more information about the stolen nature of the

7

tapes.

QUESTION:

This was not something that was just

Would you make the same argument if

there were evidence that was really very powerful that none

10

of the other items were stolen?

11

MR. BRYSON:

12

QUESTION:

You mean in other words -Your second theory of relevance would

13

be the same even if he came in later and gave evidence that

14

you would accept as clear and convincing —

15

MR. BRYSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BRYSON:

Yes, the second theory, yes.
You would still say it is the same.
I would think it would be relevant,

18

Your Honor, and it is so minimally prejudicial that I think

19

the balance could probably be drawn in favor of admitting

20

the evidence.

21
22

QUESTION:

earlier concerning your first theory —

23

MR. BRYSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Bryson, I gather from what you said

Yes.
-- that you don't think that each

similar act has to be evaluated on its own, that the criterion

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

38

1

is whether a reasonable jury could find on the basis of

2

all of the similar acts that the goods were stolen.

3

MR. BRYSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

I think that's right.
By which I mean this.

You have in your

brief the example of a counterfeiting prosecution --

6

MR. BRYSON:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, the counterfeit.

That's right.

-- and you show that the individual went

8

into ten different stores, and each one of those ten

stores

9

had a $50 bill in the cash register that was counterfeit

10

afterwards.

Now, I am not sure if you just showed one of

11

those that I'd say that that was enough that a reasonable jury

12

could find, but you would not do them one by one, you would

13

take all ten.
MR. BRYSON:

14

I think petitioner would want to do

15

them one by one, but we would not, and I think that you're

16

correct, that when you put them all together it makes a

17

compelling showing with regard to each, and there is no

18

reason that a judge in looking at the question of whether

19

this is something that a jury could conclude established the

20

question which was the basis for the conditional relevance

21

finding.

22

the judge could look at other evidence with respect to each

23

incident.

24
25

The judqe can look at all that evidence, just as

QUESTION:

Of course, the difference between that

case and this one is that everybody agrees on your

Company

39
1

hypothetical they were counterfeit, but here you don't

2

have any agreement on whether these other items were all

3

stolen.

4

MR. BRYSON:

5

QUESTION:

Well, suppose we were —
If you have 50 $10 bills and 49 of them

6

are genuine and one of them is counterfeit and he passed

7

all 50, what does that prove?

8
9

MR. BRYSON:

Well, suppose in my counterfeit

example we were unable for some reason to prove that several

10

of the bills were counterfeit, which would be analoaous to

11

this case.

12

into these Stores and paid — he went into five straight

13

stores and paid w:i th a $50 bill for a 15 cent package of gum.

14

That is pretty probative of the fact that something fishy is

15

going on, because he is trying to get rid of fifties, and who

16

gets rid of fifties?

17

That's why —

QUESTION:

18
19

People that are carrying bad fifties.

But then you prove they're good

fifties, the whole thing seems kind of silly.
MR. BRYSON:

20

21

Nonetheless, suppose further that the man went

Well, if in fact it is proved they

are good fifties, then we have a
QUESTION:

22

problem, but --

In fact, this is one of the problems

23

with hypothetical cases.

You don't go around peddling good

24

25

counterfeit in your hypothetical, and you don't know they are

That is your point.

But you know they are

(202)

628-4888

40
1

2

stolen here.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, we don't know they're stolen

3

but certainly the evidence is probative because of the nature

4

of what it describes about the process the defendant is

5

engaged in.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, on your first theory of

7

relevance, if we accept that, do we have to reach the

8

argument that there was not sufficient evidence for any

9

reasonable jury to find that these televisions were stolen?

10

MR. BRYSON:

The first theory being the theory that

11

it was admissible without regard to whether they were stolen,

12

you don't have to reach the question.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRYSON:

How about your second?
On the second you would, and the

15

question would be one not of whether either there was clear

16

or convincing evidence or even that the judge believes —

17
18
19
20

QUESTION:

No, no, whether a reasonable jury

could find.
MR. BRYSON:

— that there is a preponderance, but

rather whether a reasonable jury could draw this inference.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BRYSON:

So we do have to reach on —
On the stolen property theory.

And,

23

Your Honor, there is no difference in our submission, there

24

is nothing special about that process.

25

from the process that a judge, follows either implicitly or

explicitly.

2

QUESTION:

It seems to me that on your first

theory, that that wasn't -- that wasn't the basis on which

4

this evidence was offered.

5

MR. BRYSON: Well, the evidence, Your Honor, was --

— and we don't know what a trial judge

would have thought about it.

MR. BRYSON: Well, Your Honor, the evidence was

14

offered on the basis that it was relevant to knowledge.

15

wasn't specified in any great detail as to how.

16

prosecutor argued in closing argument without objection that

17

one reason that it was relevant was because it showed how

18

much the defendant was involved in this whole operation,

19

which didn't require a conclusion that the property was

20

stolen.

21

It

The

Now, with respect to that point, we have not

22

changed our position.

The only change in the position to

23

the extent that there is one, Your Honor, has been in the

24

Court of Appeals when we sought rehearing en banc we argued

25

that the court should not apply the clear and convincing

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

42

1

Standard but rather should apply the test it had previously

2

embraced, which is the preponderance test.

3

Now, we were stuck with what the Court had

4

previously said

5

Circuit had previously adopted a preponderance test.

6

Obviously it would have been better if we had put in a foot­

7

note and said that we believed that even the preponderance

8

test is not correct, but I think we would have had little

9

hope of persuading the Sixth Circuit to abandon its previous

10

as our alternative argument.

The Sixth

position on that.
But the — even the preponderance test, I think,

11
12

is a test which has created a lot of confusion because

13

several courts have failed to distinguish between the question

14

of whether a judge makes a finding by a preponderance or

15

whether the judge says,

16

a jury could find by a preponderance.

a

jury could find, which is to say,

17

In 104(b), just as in any other case of

18

foundation evidence, the question is, can the judge find or

19

conclude that the jury could find by a preponderance that a

20

particular fact is proven, and that is, we say that is a

21

basic relevance inquiry. That, we think, is the correct

22

view.

23

although I think that is misleading.

24

not the judge making a determination that there is a

25

preponderance and therefore making, for example,

You can call it a preponderance view of a sort,

(202)

But it is definitely

3

Now, I think in order to focus on this distinction

4

between Rules 104 (a) and 104 (b) , which is the crux of

5

petitioner's argument now, it is important to note that

6

104(a) deals basically with questions of competence, not

7

questions of relevancy.

8

to preliminary Questions in determining whether hearsay

9

evidence should be admitted, preliminary questions in

The rule applies, for example

10

determining whether a witness is Qualified, that sort of

inquiry.
It does not apply and specifically excepts that

This question in this case as we see it is a pure question

of relevance.

20

his own whether the evidence had met whatever factual

21

condition there was by a preponderance.

22

I think petitioner is correct that if this

That is to say, the judge would have to decide on

That does not apply in the case of Rule 104(b)

23

where the rule specifically states that all that is

24

necessary is for the judge to conclude that there is enough

25

evidence to justify the finding, that is to say, to justify

the jury making a finding, and the advisory committee notes

to 104(b) specifically lay out that this is a question for

juries, this is not a- question for judges.

question we have in this case, which is one of conditional

relevance, if we go solely on the stolen property theory.

That is the

Conditional relevance may not apply at all, if we

6

7

go on the theory that the evidence is admissible without

8

regard to whether the TVs were stolen, so that's the way we

9

view the relationship between Rule 104(a) and 104(b).

In

provision that requires balancing.

QUESTION:

That is exactly what we say.
In some cases you would even allow

23

that that balancing would lead a court to say I won't let

24

it in unless I believe by a preponderance that it was stolen.

25

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think a judge should not draw

a conclusion like that which would simply be a way of

2

getting around Rule 104(b), but I would think there would

be cases --

6

QUESTION:

Conceivably a judge might think it

was so prejudicial that that's the standard he'd impose.
MR. BRYSON:

Exactly.

I think it would be wrong

7

for a judae to say as a matter of course in my courtroom

8

from here on out I am going to read Rule 403 and you are

9

never going to get anything in unless it meets the pre­

10

ponderance test,

11

or like your red hat example,

12

I mean,

no matter how minimally prejudicial it is,
it is not prejudicial at all.

I have an aversion to red hats, and you

13

had better prove it by a preponderance.

14

and it would also be wrong, but the test that we suggest and

15

what I think the advisory committee and the various

16

committees that commented on the rules at the time they were

17

being devised wanted to focus the attention of the court on

18

the question of, A,

19

probative, and that is" the question that is just an inherent

20

part of the v/hole Article 4 relevancy provision in the rules.

That would be crazy,

and B, prejudicial versus

Now, petitioner claims that a number of circuits

22

have adopted his 104(a)

23

one circuit has adopted Rule 104(a),

24

Circuit, and it has done'it in a kind of backwards way.

25

What it has said is because we adhere to the clear and

analysis here.

As we read it, only

and that is the Seventh

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

46

1

convincing test, and the Seventh Circuit is one of the courts

2

that adheres to that test, we believe that it would be odd

3

to ask a jury to make a finding like that.

4

must make such a finding, and therefore because the only rule

5

that requires judges to make findings is Rule 104(a),

6

therefore this must be a Rule 104(a) question.

7

Therefore a judge

Well, if you don't start with the assumption that

8

the clear and convincing evidence test is the right test,

9

then you don't end up with Rule 10 4(a) .

Every other court

10

that has addressed this question has either ruled that the

11

clear and convincing or preponderance test applies without

12

focusing on the rule at all, simply by applying old common

13

law notions from their own common law developments, or

14

have been courts that have said this is a question of

15

conditional relevance, which is our position.
Now, we think that some courts have incorrectly

16
17

said it is always a conditional relevance question.

18

isn't always a conditional relevance

19

may not be any preliminary fact to be found, but when it is,

20

then it is decided under Rule 104(b), just like any other

21

piece of evidence.

the Court of Appeals decided the case, although they weighed

the factors different from the way you would, that they

did this balancing and said the District Judae had found

that probative value outweighed the other?

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRYSON:

In the first —
I believe so, in the panel opinion.

10

I believe that they invoked the clear and convincing test,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

21

MR. FERRIS:

Thank youk, Mr. Bryson.

Your Honor, the government does admit

22

104(b) comes into play in these cases, and they should

23

because the advisory committee notes to 401 recognize the

24

distinction between logical relevancy under 401 and

25

conditional relevancy under 104.

And Rule 402 merely states

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

48

1

that relevant evidence is admissible except as otherwise

2

provided for by other rules.

3

that 104(a) applies here but if 104(b) applies that,

4

six different circuits have ruled that the preponderance of

5

evidence test is what that rule means.

6

QUESTION:

104(a) -- it is our position

May I just ask there, when you say

7

preponderance of evidence, do you mean the judge must find

8

by a preponderance, or there must be sufficient evidence

9

that a jury could find?

10

MR. FERRIS:

Yes, I misspoke to Justice White.

I

11

believe that the jury -- I mean, that the judge has to find

12

that before it is submitted.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

So you and your opponent disagree on

the meaning of the preponderance standard.
MR. FERRIS:

Yes.

The preponderance should be

16

decided by the judge because of the prejudicial nature of

17

the evidence, and Justice Scalia asked about Rule 403.

18

are some commentators, notably Weinstein, who indicates that

19

403 should be a sliding scale, that the more prejudicial

20

the evidence, that the higher the standard of proof should

21

be that it occurred.
