CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

you are ready, Mr. Fawer.

You may proceed whenever

MR. FAWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case, stated simply, is whether the

7

principal of a one-man corporation, simply by virtue of the

8

fact that his status as its records custodian, can be compelled

9

to make self-incriminatory, tacitly testimonial disclosures; or

10

is he, like the custodian in U.S. v. Doe, to be afforded the

11

limited act of production privilege secured to all natural

12

persons under the Fifth Amendment?

13

The facts of the case are quite simple:

the Internal

Revenue Service and the United States Attorney in the Southern

15

District of Mississippi began a grand jury investigation,

16

criminal tax investigation, of Randy Braswell.

17

target of that investigation, and there is no issue as to that.

He was the

In August 1986, during the course of that

19

investigation, the subpoena duces tecum was served upon Mr.

20

Braswell as President of his corporation, of the one-man

21

corporation that he has called Worldwide Purchasing.

22

It was a broad-based subpoena virtually identical ~To

23

the one that is before Your Honors in U.S. v. Doe.

?

1

our act of production privilege.

2

stating that no corporate custodian has any act of production

3

privilege; with that issue joined, there was a brief

4

evidentiary hearing before the court in that district, and the

5

court found that Mr. Braswell did, in fact, conduct his

6

business as close to a sole-proprietorship, as one could see.

7

The Government opposed,

Nevertheless the court held, as the Government had

8

contended, that the act of production was not available to any

9

corporate custodian under the Fifth Amendment; and that they

10

relied on the case, the Lincoln case in the Fifth Circuit,

11

which so-held.

12

We, at that time refused to produce before the grand

13

jury -- we had a contempt citation against us; there was a stay

14

of the commitment under the contempt citation; and the Fifth

15

Circuit affirmed on the same grounds as had the ruling of the

16

D.C. Circuit — a D.C. court, excuse me.

17

We did, of course, note in that context that there

18

was a split in the circuits as to whether or not the Beilis

19

decision of this Court was limited to the contents of records

20

of a corporation; as opposed to the testimonial -- the tacitly

21

testimonial aspects of the act of production.

22

Our position is quite simple.

We feel that we are

23

entitled -- that Mr. Braswell is entitled to the same

24

production with respect to his records, the corporate records,

25

as is the records custodian in Doe.

Heritage

The only distinction

4

(202) 628-4888

>

1

between the two is Braswell, Inc. chose to do business under

2

the corporate framework.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that distinction has been recognized

4

since the time of Hale v. Henkel, hasn't it, in 1906.

5

Court said it is a distinction of constitutional significance.

6

MR. FAWER:

The

It is true, Your Honor, I think it is

7

fair to say, as this Court has said on -- at least, I believe

8

this Court has said, that they were addressing the question of

9

whether or not the contents of corporate records, as opposed to

10

the testimonial aspects of the Fifth Amendment, were in fact to

11

be privileged?

12

We do not dispute, nor did we dispute below, that the

13

Government has an absolute right to the contents of the records

14

of Mr. Braswell's corporation.

15

nor do we think it would be proper.

16

We do not in any way deny that,

That proposition has been established at least as

17

early as Hale right through the Beilis decision.

18

Fisher and Doe do nothing to undercut it.

And I believe

19

Our position is simply that, as to anything

20

testimonial, of whatever nature it may be; whatever form it may

21

take, this Court has always protected that type of disclosure.

22

And Mr. Braswell, although he is a representative of

23

a corporation, is at the same time a person of flesh-and-blood,

24

and he has the right with respect to his testimony to claim

25

protection of the Fifth Amendment.

Heritage

QUESTION:

And your claim here is that, by the act

2

of producing the records, the fact that he was the one who

3

produced them and not someone else would have had a tendency to

4

incriminate him?

5

MR. FAWER:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct.
I would suppose your position would apply

7

to any corporation -- or to any person who is the custodian of

8

the corporate records of anybody?

9

MR. FAWER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FAWER:

12

That is correct.
Of any corporation?
That is exactly our position.

To put it

another way --

13

QUESTION:

So it's the one-man corporation has

14

nothing to do with this case?

15

MR. FAWER:

V

That is true, Your Honor.

What happened

16

to be a one-man corporation; and in fact, below we candidly

17

made the argument that a one-man corporation should not under

18

the doctrine of Beilis and --

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, let me — your client was forced to

produce these records?

21

MR. FAWER:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.
And if he hadn't -- and if he hadn't

23

produced them, but a third person had, the fact that they were

24

corporate records and had been authenticated, could be used

25

against him?

6

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

MR. FAWER:

Yes, in fact -If he hadn't produced them; if somebody

QUESTION:
else had?

Yes, if he was not involved in any way in

MR. FAWER:

making those records available.

And they had somebody — if

the records, for example were — if they had issued that -QUESTION:

Well, I know, but all the —

authentication does is to authenticate the fact that they are
corporate records?
MR. FAWER:

Other people could authenticate -- well,

theoretically, could authenticate corporate records.
QUESTION:
authenticate them.

Well, he isn't any worse off if he has to
All that's been authenticated is that these

are corporate records.
MR. FAWER:
QUESTION:
MR. FAWER:

It seems to me, Your Honor -These are corporate records?
Yes.

But we are not -- I don't think the

Court should look to whether or not the test under the Fifth
Amendment is not whether or not the Government to have an
independent means of being able to do it here to prove this
fact; in this instance, if you make him produce, then he will
be using his tacit admission against him.

And that this Court

has always condemned.
QUESTION:

Well, you're going to be using the fact

that these are corporate records against him?

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. FAWER:

We're going to be using the fact that he

produced a particular record.

We don't know which record this

would apply to, because in the court below, we did not have a
hearing on the particular applicability of the act of
production doctrine in this case.

Because once the Government

-- excuse me, Judge Barber ruled that it was not available to a
corporate custodian, that was the end of the matter.
We have asserted, and nobody has denied, that we are
-- we would be, incriminated by the introduction in this case.
QUESTION:

You're asking us to overrule a case that's

some 80 years old, and I'm interested in just what sort of
incriminating -- to get into how a corporate custodian of a
one-man corporation would incriminate himself by producing, or
simply authenticating corporate records?
MR. FAWER:

Two points, Your Honor.

I must might

first point out -- I assume the case you are referring to is
Hale v. Henkel, whom you said a case that is -QUESTION:

Hale v. Henkel; Wilson in 1911; White in

1943 —
MR. FAWER:

But it is important to note when you look

at Hale that technically what was done in Hale -QUESTION:

I'm not so much interested in the

hypothesis; that is, the introduction of my question itself;
and that is, how in this case, does a corporate custodian
incriminate himself by simply authenticating corporate records?

MR. FAWER:

When Randy — if Randy Braswell — the

2

direct response to your question is, if Randy Braswell didn't

3

bring in records, when he turns those records over he is

4

representing these are the records that you've asked for.

5

That is in itself a representation which has

6

testimonial implications:

7

records other than the corporate records.

8
9

QUESTION:

he has -- this man has no financial

So he might incriminate himself because

he's lying about whether those are all the corporate records -

10

MR. FAWER:

11

QUESTION:

That's one possibility.
That would be a defense to anyone

12

responding to a subpoena:

13

may not be producing everything the subpoena calls for.

14

MR. FAWER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FAWER:

I may incriminate myself because I

That's true.
That would be an astounding doctrine.
Well, no.

It seems to me, Your Honor,

17

that everybody -- the only individual that I know of right now

18

where there is an issue as to whether or not there is an act -

19

there is an exception, with respect to the act of production

20
21

privilege, is the corporate custodian.
The inferences that can flow, in a Tax Court case

22

particularly, from the fact that you possess certain records;

23

or that you don't produce all the records; or that you have

24

possession — or that certain records do or do not exist; are

QUESTION:

How would the Tax Court get these records?

MR. FAWER:

How would the -- excuse me. Your Honor?

QUESTION:

How could they get it other than the way

in this case?
MR. FAWER:

Very simply.

time there is a privilege raised:

The way you get records any
you immunize, statutorily

immunize the man who has the privilege.
QUESTION:

Why should he be immunized?

MR. FAWER:

Because the Fifth Amendment protects him

from not incriminating himself testimonially.
QUESTION:

Would that apply to any secretary of any

corporation?
MR. FAWER:
QUESTION:

If that is to whom the subpoena -Well,

how would you get them otherwise if

you didn't want to immunize?
MR. FAWER:
QUESTION:

You still get the records.
How?

MR. FAWER:
QUESTION:

You can get somebody else.
Who?

MR. FAWER:

Who?

In this corporation, I don't know that

there is anybody else.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

Well, all right,

that's what I thought.
MR. FAWER:

But the same is true in Doe.

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The exact

same question would be raised by Your Honor in Doe.
QUESTION:

Well, what would be about General Motors?

The same rule would apply?

QUESTION:

If you use the direct —
Would you want the same rule apply?
Yes.
To General Motors?
Yes.

If you --

So you couldn't get the records intact?

How would you get any corporate records?
MR. FAWER:

So we understand -- you have a right to

those records; the Government has a right to the contents of
those records.
QUESTION:
MR. FAWER:

But you can't get them.
You can get them in two ways:

you can

get them either by immunizing -- that narrow immunization as to
the testimonial implications of the production on the person
you served your subpoena on; if that's who you insist produces
them, or you find somebody else who does not have such a claim.
And you analyze it.
In the Doe case, it wasn't a corporation.

One man

happened to have a larger business entity than does Randy
Braswell.
QUESTION:
MR. FAWER:

Why, that isn't even interesting.
Excuse me?

Heritage

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FAWER:

You don't even interest me at all.
The point, I think, Your Honor, that

3

we're talking about, in Fifth Amendment protection, it is not

4

limited to solely someone who has a sole proprietorship.

5

I would think that someone like Randy Braswell would

6

be of interest to Your Honor in the sense that he has a Fifth

7

Amendment privilege with respect to any kind of testimony, no

8

matter what type it may be.

9

And we all acknowledge -- I think this Court has

10

acknowledged clearly in Doe; in Fisher; in Curcio; and you

11

would go back into any -- way before that -- that the cases

12

make clear that testimonial, tacit testimonial admission is

13

protected under the Fifth Amendment.

14

And the only real question here is why should we not

15

afford that same privilege to someone who happens to be doing

16

business or holding corporate records.

17

very narrow focus here.

18

That's all.

That's the

And what we're saying is, if you don't afford Randy

19

Braswell the privilege, then you are going to deny him the

20

right to say,

21

producing these records.

And we are not asking in any way, in any doctrine or
revision of what the Court has done.
QUESTION:

Because Doe would

cover your case if this weren't a corporation.

Corporation

628-4888

At least I take

1

it that is what you say.

2

MR. FAWER:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.
The Court has in the privilege against

4

self-incrimination has always drawn a line between an

5

individual and a corporation.

6

MR. FAWER:

It has always drawn that line, but I

7

believe, I think it was Justice

8

number of cases, the line was always drawn with respect to

9

access to content, not testimony.

Brennan has indicated in a

The line was drawn because of what Boyd had to say,

10
11

and the unhappiness of the Court over the past century of

12

Boyd's protection -- potential protection, of contents.
And then everything -- the collective entity doctrine

13
14

was a response to the contents, the privacy rationale

15

underlying Boyd.

16

consistent attacks; or a consistent doctrine that says, "If

17

it's corporate, we are not going to protect the contents.

18

Government has a right to them."

From Hale to Beilis, that's what you have:

The

What Fisher and Doe, but basically Fisher, does, it

19

20

says,

21

not going to protect the contents of business records at any

22

rate.

23

"The nature of the entity makes no difference."

QUESTION:

We are

Well, Mr. Fawer, Fisher specifically made

24

reference to the collective entity rule, and I thought in a way

25

which indicated an attempt to preserve it.

13

Heritage

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

The Government says to us that it may not make

1
2

evidentiary use of the fact that a particular individual within

3

the corporation performed the physical act of production.

4

that's true, I don't see how you should be concerned about any

5

testimonial aspect; the Government says it has a right to use

6

the corporation's act of production to incriminate the

7

individual; but ought to use the fact that a particular

individual responded to the subpoena.

If

Why do you have a problem?

9

MR. FAWER:

10

I have a problem because I think that

11

what the Government is asking you to do is to engage in a pure

12

fiction.

13
14

We have no problem that in a -QUESTION:

Well, the use of the corporations is a

legal fiction --

15

MR. FAWER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FAWER:

Truly.
-- and this is a result of that.
But I do not know why this Court should

18

want to be party to using a patent fiction to deny a natural

19

person his rights under the Fifth Amendment.

20

Now why do I say it's a fiction?

21

QUESTION:

22
23

The problem really is that the contents of

these records may be very incriminating.
MR. FAWER:

We suggest to Your Honor, they may be.

24

But we have no right to hide behind those contents.

25

a right to -- I say, the Government has a right to those

14

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

You have

1
2

contents.
QUESTION:

I take it that part of the immunity you

3

would want is that it is unlawful for the Government to use the

4

act of production to show that he knew the documents existed?

5

MR. FAWER:

6

QUESTION:

That is part of it, Your Honor, yes.
So in the case of any corporation, the

7

officer who produces the documents, under your rule, cannot be

8

charged with knowledge of their existence in any prosecution?

9

MR. FAWER:

He cannot be charged with knowledge of

10

the existence of the document, but what the document contains

11

can be used against him.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FAWER:

14

QUESTION:

15

Well, not until they're authenticated.
Authenticated by him or someone else?
But knowledge of the documents is highly

relevant in most criminal prosecutions, we know that.

16

MR. FAWER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
And that would apply to General Motors,

18

because some officers may have confidential knowledge of a very

19

secret transaction, and the only people that know about the

20

transaction are the ones that are producing the documents, and

21

your rule would require immunity from the use of the production

22

of the documents to show they knew they existed.

23

MR. FAWER:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FAWER:

My rule -That's your rule, isn't it?
If he is the only person -- if you need

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

to have him produce it.

2

QUESTION:

Now, wait.

If he's the only one or not.

3

All your rule would exclude is showing that he knew of it from

4

the fact of his production of it.

5

MR. FAWER:

Exactly.

6

QUESTION:

7

knew of it in other fashions.

You would still be able to show that he

8

MR. FAWER:

Exactly.

9

MR. FAWER:

Wouldn't you?

You'd be able to show --

10

what about your being able to show that his signature was on

11

it?

12

they were kept in his home; all sorts of things, right?

13

That you could show by the testimony of other people that

MR. FAWER:

Every other inference; every other piece

14

of direct proof would be available.

15

it to, the only thing you couldn't do is from the mere fact

16

that this person had brought them into court, that brought them

17

into the grand jury, that fact couldn't be used against him.

18
19

QUESTION:

MR. FAWER:

21

QUESTION:

23

But until they're properly authenticated

by somebody the records are not admissible against him at all.

20

22

All you would be limiting

That is true, but they're are very —
Contents or otherwise, they have to be

authenticated.
MR. FAWER:

Someone has to authenticate them.

24

take the typical case, I mean, surely in General Motors, we

really shouldn't be worried that in General Motors there's not

the documents?

QUESTION:

4

MR. FAWER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but —
But in Tax Court --- maybe only the representatives of

6

corporations know which ones they are and can pick out the one

7

who needs the immunity best.

8

before they see the documents?

9

MR. FAWER:

10

QUESTION:

And how does the Government know

I do not think -And in this case, you talk about

11

alternates, why couldn't your client have designated somebody

12

else to produce the documents on behalf of the corporation and

13

gotten the same protection?

14

MR. FAWER:

15

QUESTION:

Shouldn't the Government have accepted

MR. FAWER:

The Government, I think, would have

16
17

We would have no problem should all --

that?

18

accepted that; but they might not have accepted at this point.

19

They have insisted that he produce.

20

Do I know whether they would have accepted the third

21

party bringing them in?

22

Your Honor, that if a third party were to -- if you were to

23

follow that mechanism, you'd still have to afford him the

24

protection.

25

QUESTION:

I don't know.

But I would suggest,

Well, but say he hired his lawyer and his

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

lawyer produced the documents, says, "I represent the
corporation; I made the search commanded by the subpoena; and
here are the documents."

Why wouldn't that protect your

client?
MR. FAWER:

Justice Stevens, if I were Mr. Braswell's

private attorney at that point, and not some other lawyer, I
would tell Mr. Braswell he should still assert his privilege
and not rely on the possibility that that other lawyer would
assert an attorney-client privilege of some sort to protect Mr.
Braswell.
QUESTION:

You mean you assume the attorney would not

act in his proper -MR. FAWER:

I don't assume that, but I don't want to

assume the contrary either.

I have a right not to incriminate

myself, and if the Government can bring that attorney in, and
if that attorney decides for one reason or another, that he is
free to make that disclosure -QUESTION:

Not only Hale v. Henkel in 1906, but more

That holding has been reaffirmed by this Court in
case after case in succeeding years.
QUESTION:

Is that true even if production of the

documents would incriminate the person in a trial against that
person without reference to the corporation?
MR. ENGLERT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court has so-

stated regularly.
QUESTION:

So that you are willing to try the case on

14

the assumption that Braswell might well incriminate himself by

15

reference to the knowledge or the existence of the documents?

16

MR. ENGLERT:

We're willing to submit the case to

this Court on that assumption.

these documents against him to prove those matters?

significance that may have for authentication or anything else,
we can use that fact.
What we can't do is say "Not only did Worldwide

ENGLERT:

proposition?
MR. ENGLERT:

For the underlying theory,

I cite

14

primarily the White case decided in 1944.

15

quoted at pages 21-22 of our brief, that's a passage that was

16

repeated in the Curcio case;

QUESTION:

Well,

I just want to make it clear:

you

24

are stating that he does have a privilege against his own

25

incrimination; and you are conceding that these documents may

MR. ENGLERT:

Your Honor, I wouldn't phrase it that

way, no.

QUESTION:

Well, what protection does he have?

MR. ENGLERT:

If the Government at trial asked the

6

question,

"Isn't it true, Mr. Process-server, that Randy

7

Braswell was the man who handed you these documents?"

8

defense counsel objected, I think the Court would have to

9

sustain that objection.

And

It's a ground derived from this

Court's Fifth Amendment decisions, to be sure, but it's simply,

11

Justice White, it's simply holding the Government to the

12

underlying theory that this Court --

13

QUESTION:

But that -- I don't really see your point.

14

It's -- how is the Government held to its underlying theory by

15

doing that?

16

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, I think the best I can do is to

17

ask the Court to look at the quotation on pages 21 and 22 of

18

our brief from the White case.

19

"Individuals acting as a representative of a collective group

20

cannot be said to be exercising their personal rights and

21

duties; nor to be entitled to their purely personal rights and

22

privileges, et cetera, in their official capacity where they

That is what the Court has said, is that, notwithstanding -QUESTION:

11

But if that's true, then your answer to

12

Justice Scalia's question would be there is no testimonial

13

compulsion when a private person is forced to produce the

14

documents?
MR. ENGLERT:

15

No, Your Honor, I don't think the

16

doctrine turns on the lack of testimonial compulsion.

17

doctrine, again, as we understand it, was best stated in the

18

White case, not saying that the individual — not saying that

19

there is no act of compulsion; not saying that there is no

20

testimony; saying that individuals, when they act as corporate

21

agents, are not exercising their personal rights.

The

So the Fifth Amendment is essentially --

MR. ENGLERT:

Heritage

We're unwilling to do that, Your Honor,

37
Reporting Corporation

because in some cases at least, there are components to the act

of production that are very important to us that we want to use

produced the documents; but that the corporation had possession

That's the problem.

And then what are you going to do?
We can try to hold the corporation in

disband the corporation; which would make it awfully hard to

hold it in contempt.

QUESTION:

9

MR. ENGLERT:

11

As to any corporate records you may

Yes.
I think the Court has gone that far

many times.
QUESTION:

So you think the law is that Braswell has

12

no Fifth Amendment rights because he formed a corporation, as

13

to any documents he might be asked to produce as a corporate

14

officer, even though there may be some testimonial incidents to

15

production?

16

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes, and if Your Honor will indulge me,

17

I'd just like to read a couple of things this Court said in the

18

Curcio case, a case primarily relied on by my opponents, to see

19

just whether the Court has said that.

20

our brief at the bottom of page 24,

21

books and records of corporations cannot be insulated from

22

reasonable demands of governmental authorities by a claim of

23

personal privilege on the part of their custodian."

The quote in page 17 of

"The Court said that the

On the next page we quote the passage from page 128
of the Curcio decision, "A corporate or association records, by

40
Reporting Corporation

their custodian, is readily justifiable, even though the

2

custodian protests against it for personal reasons."
QUESTION:

3

Well, if that's true, then to go back to

4

the beginning, I don't understand why you make the concession

5

that you do on page 34 that for some purposes you can't use the

6

information?

7

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Your Honor, again, if the

8

concession is unwise, I'm sure the Court will tell us so. But

9

we do think the concession flows logically from the underlying

10

agency rationale of the doctrine, that the individual, although

11

waiver is one doctrine that's been invoked, all of the

12

undesirability of a de facto privilege for the corporation has

13

also been invoked, out of practical necessity, has been invoked

14

-- the Court has, we think primarily rested on the agency

15

rationale that in individual simply is not acting as an

16

individual

when he produces documents.
Corporations have to act through human beings.

18

That's what was pointed out by the Court in the opinion in

Yes.

QUESTION:

7

MR. ENGLERT:

That's very significant,

Well, I'm sorry about that, but the

point is, that we're not seeking to get testimony before the

10

the grand jury in Curcio.

We're trying to get these documents;

11

we're trying to make sure that we can get these documents in an

effective way, and our underlying worry in these cases, and the

underlying worry that the Court has recognized, is that just

16
