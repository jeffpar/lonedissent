MR. SILBERMAN:

!

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court*. ••!:;: i,;

10

This is an ;actioh that was commenced by the;:

11

Respondent Employer under section 301 of the Labor Management

12

Relations Act of 1947, in an attempt to overturn an arbitration

13

award that was rendered pursuant to the collective bargaining

14

agreement between the Petitioner Union and the Employer.

15

The question that is presented to this Court is

16

whether the courts are free in such an action to relieve one

17

party to a lawful collective bargaining agreement, as that

18

agreement has been interpreted by the arbitrator, to relieve a

19

party of his obligations under the contract on the theory

20

there is some public policy against enforcing that lawful

21

contract.

22

that

The facts out of which that question arises can be

23

briefly summarized, and in light of the conclusory labels

24

have been tossed around in the briefs, are of some particular

25

importance here.

Heritage

that

In February of 1983, the company discharged an

1
2

employee by the name of Isiah Cooper.

3

the discharge was that Mr. Cooper had been seen possessing a

4

marijuana cigarette in a car in the company's parking lot.

5

the company maintained that that established a violation of a

6

work rule promulgated against the company, which rule prohibits

7

an employee from bringing marijuana onto company premises or

8

using marijuana or alcohol.

9

The stated ground for

And

The union filed a grievance alleging that the

10

discharge was without just cause and therefore in breach of

11

Contract.

12

the auspices of the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service.

13

The arbitrator found as a matter of fact that the

And that grievance was submitted to arbitration and

14

company had failed to prove a violation of the work rule in the

15

manner respected:

16

bringing that marijuana cigarette onto company property or

17

smoking that cigarette.

18

the employee; was not guilty of either

The arbitrator noted that the company at the hearing

19

had attempted to defend the discharge on a new ground by

20

claiming that there was evidence that tracings of marijuana had

21

been found in a plastic bag in the employee's car.

22

arbitrator said that he would not consider that evidence.

23

But the

He explained that the just cause provision of the

24

contract was to be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary

25

meaning of that phrase,

Heritage

"in industrial relations," and just

4
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

cause prohibits an employee from introducing new grounds that

2

were not raised at the time of the discharge or at any time in

3

the grievance procedure.

4

So having therefore found that the only question that

5

was before him -- the company had failed to make out its proof

6

—the arbitrator ordered the employee reinstated with back

7

pay, and this lawsuit followed.

l

8
9

The employer succeeded in persuading the lower courts
to vacate the arbitration award.

Now it is important to note

10

that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals

11

quarreled with the job that the arbitrator had done as the

12

interpreter of the contract.

13

That is, they accepted the validity of his conclusion

14

that the employer here; had promised that it would not discharge

15

an employee unless it was able to prove the grounds on which

16

the discharge was based.

17

The court also did not question the fact that the

18

employer was perfectly free to enter into that promise; there

19

is nothing in the law to prohibit it.

20

instance to live up to his promise; there was nothing in the

21

law that makes it unlawful for him to take this employee back.

And he was free in this

22

But the courts nonetheless concluded that it was

23

against public policy for them to hold the employer to his

24

promise, and the particular public policy they cited is "the

25

public policy against the operation of dangerous machinery by

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol."
Now it is our principal submission here that in

2

3

arrogating to itself this kind of power, to refuse to enforce a

4

lawful collective bargaining agreement, the lower courts have

5

overstepped the limits of their authority under Section 301 of

6

QUESTION:

7

You don't say that there isn't any public

8

policy exception, you just say it is a good deal narrower than

9

the Fifth Circuit thought it was?
MR. SILBERMAN:

10

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

We say sthat insofar as the court is saying, that even though

12

this is a lawful agreement, there is a public policy against

13

enforcing this perfectly lawful agreement.

14
15

We don't think the court's authority goes that far,
and we think the proper role --

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Silberman, if the finding had been

17

that indeed this employee had had a marijuana cigarette out in

18

the parking lot of the employer's premises, and had been

19

smoking it, and the arbitrator had further concluded that he

20

should be restored to his job, could the public policy

21

exception apply there to justify saying, that's an improper

22

remedy?

23

MR. SILBERMAN:

Your Honor, we believe not.

As we

24

understand the public policy exception, the rule is the one

25

stated by Judge Easterbrook in his opinion in the E. I. DuPont

Heritage

6
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

case in the Seventh Circuit, and it is a rule that constrains

2

the court to enforce positive law and not to introduce its own

3

notions in that way.

4

And we think that the rule that Judge —

5

QUESTION:

Do you think that there conceivably could

6

be a valid recognizable public policy to the effect that

7

employees will not, if they are under the influence of drugs or

8

alcohol, be allowed to work with dangerous machines?
What about the Occupational Safety and Health Act and

9
10

11

so forth?
MR. SILBERMAN:

Certainly there could be a public

12

policy in the sense that a legislature could say that people

13

who have committed this wrong should not be employed in that

14

category of jobs, and we certainly have no quarrel with the

15

notion that there could be a public policy in that sense.

16

We do believe* however, that if the legislature has

17

not gone that far and has stated a public policy at the general

18

level of, for example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act,

19

that it is not consistent with the labor relations system, and

20

it is not appropriate for the courts to attempt to elaborate

21

upon that policy by trying to decide whether that policy would

22

Or would not be served or disserved —

23

QUESTION:

So that an employee, an airline pilot, who

24

drinks, should be nevertheless allowed to fly if the arbitrator

25

so decides?

7

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

MR. SILBERMAN:

1

Fortunately, that is precise instance

2

where there is a Federal Aviation Administration which decides

3

are or are not entitled to fly, if there is an FAA regulation,

4

and there is indeed a regulation covering pilots who have been

5

using alcohol.
So that if the: FAA says that this person should not

6
7

be, flying, then clearly an arbitrator's award that puts that

8

person back to work would not be entitled to enforcement.
But it is precisely our point that if the FAA has

9
10

said that, yes, it's okay for this person to fly, and the

11

employer has promised that he will take this person back — at

12

least the arbitrator has told us that's what his promise means

13

-r-

14

trying to -— of second guessing the FAA and substituting their

15

view of what is sound for the party's view or the FAA's view.

16

that the court should not put themselves in the business of

QUESTIONt

If I understand Judge Easterbrook's

18

thesis, it is that the arbitrator does nothing but give content
[
to the words of the contract, and if the contract, as worded by

19

the arbitrator, would not, if it had been written that way, be

20

contrary to law, neither is the arbitrator's decision.

17

21

So that, in the instance that you just cited, if a

22

contract is not unlawful, which does not provide for the firing

23

of someone who smokes marijuana in the parking lot, if such a

24

contract without that provision is lawful, then the

25

arbitrator's statement, that you can't fire this fellow for

Heritage

8
Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

smoking marijuana in the parking lot, is also lawful.
MR. SILBERMAN:

2

That's precisely how I understand

3

Judge Easterbrook's approach, Justice Scalia.

4

that that approach makes particularly good sense, I should add,

5

in the context of a just cause discharge kind of case.

6

And we do think

Because in that;kind of case, the very question that

7

is being decided is, what is the appropriate punishment or

8

penalty for a particular individual who has committed a

9

particular kind of wrong.

And there is a variety of factors

10

that one might want to take into account in making that

11

judgment, and that is precisely what arbitrators do.

12

And unless --

13

QUESTION:

There is still a good deal of room between

14

that and saying you do nothing but enforce the statutes that

15

are on the book.

16

you can't write into a contract, they will not be enforced even

17

there is not provision of law which says that they are

18

unlawful.

That is to say, there are some things which

19

I mean, there is a long line of contracts cases

20

refusing to enforce contracts as being contrary to public

21

policy.

22

because what they permit or encourage would violate a statute.

23

So what Judge Easterbrook said does not go so far as

24

to say that only when there is an explicit statute making this

25

conduct unlawful is it bad.

Not because they violate any explicit statute, but

9

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

1

MR. SILBERMAN:

I think Judge Easterbrook does go

2

precisely that far, and we do think that that is indeed the

3

appropriate in the particular 301 context in which we find

4

ourselves here.

5

QUESTION:'

What if the fellow had been a truck driver

6

and was found two or three times to have been driving while

7

under the influence of marijuana?

8

Louisiana law.

9

interpretation of the contract.

And let's say that violates

The arbitrator says, take him back, that is my

10

Now I suppose there is nothing in Louisiana law that

11

says you are forbidden to re-employ someone who has been three

12

times convicted of driving under marijuana unless his license

13

is revoked, and let's say this fellow's license hasn't been

14

revoked.

15
16
17

Now do you think a District Court must enforce that
award?
MR. SILBERMAN:

Yes, we do, Mr. Chief Justice.

We

18

believe that if there is nothing in Louisiana law and the state

19

is perfectly free, as you suggest, the state does license truck

20

drivers, and it's the state's responsibility to decide whether

21

somebody should not be on the road.

22

But if the employer has the lawful discretion to

23

employ this person, and the employer has agreed by contract

24

that it will continue to employ that person, we think it is not

25

an appropriate role for the courts to second guess and overturn

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the employer's promise in that regard.
QUESTION;

2

Then there really isn't any sort of public

3

policy -- room for a court's public policy determinations under

4

301, in your view, as there traditionally has been in the law

5

of contracts.

6

the law of contracts is much broader than you say.

Because certainly the public policy exception in

7

MR. SILBERMAN:

I would say two things in response,

8

Chief Justice Rehnquist.

9

common law notion, the common law notion itself always assumed

The first is, as we understand the

10

that whatever common law powers the judges exercise was subject

11

to the subordinate power of a legislature to establish public

12

policy.
So that in so far as we are right in suggesting, if

13
14

the Congress did that, when it enacted the National Labor

15

Relations Act and when it created this system of collective

16

bargaining and of grievance arbitration, we think our position

17

is entirely consistent with the principle of the common law

18

doctrine, although I certainly do concede that in a particular

19

case a common law judge would have exercised a broader

20

authority.

21

We also would note that this Court has made clear in

22

other 301 cases that ordinary contract principles do not fit

23

very well to this peculiar 301 context, and should not be

24

binding in fashioning the federal law of labor contracts.

25

QUESTION:

Would you adhere to your view even in

Heritage

11
Reporting Corporation

circumstances when the employer might be a public employer

2

charged with a specific mandate or duty to provide a certain

3

service?

4

5

For example, to provide transportation to young

MR. SILBERMAN:

6

Section 301 does not apply to public

7

employers.

8

that only apply in private sector labor relations.
Now it seems to us that there are really two critical

9
10

The policies on which we are arguing are policies

aspects of the National Labor Relations Act —
QUESTION:

11

What about a school bus driver for a

12

private school?

I mean, change Justice O'Connor's hypothetical

13

to a school bus driver for a private school.

14

301 application there?
MR. SILBERMAN:

15

Would you give

Our answer does not change.

That is

16

right.

17

to employ that person, public authorities have not seen fit to

18

disqualify that individual, and if the arbitrator has concluded

19

— taking into account all the circumstances — that this is

20

not somebody that has done such a wrong that he should be taken

21

from his job completely and totally and absolutely, that there

22

is no basis in principle for the courts to second guess that

23

kind of judgment.

24
25

We would say in that case that if the employer is free

And what the courts wind up doing if they do so is
really substituting their judgment as to what is the sound way

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

of treating people for either public laws judgment or the

2

party's judgment, and that this system —

3

QUESTION:

Of course, that's what common law courts

4

did, was to occasionally substitute their judgment for the

5

party's judgment.

6

about all of this and decided that there should be no public

7

policy exception to labor contracts?

You say, in this case, Congress thought

8

MR. SILBERMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

thought about this?

11

We say that the principle in —

What evidence do you have that Congress

MR. SILBERMAN:

I think what we say is slightly

12

different than that, Mr, Chief Justice.

13

the policies that the Congress enacted leave no room, that it

14

would run at cross purposes with the statute, it would

15

fundamentally undermine the statute if the courts were to

16

exercise that kind of power.

17

What we say is that

And it seems to us there are two interrelated aspects

18

of labor policy that really bear on this question.

19

policy of favoring free collective bargaining, of private

20

autonomy and decision making.

21

National Labor Relations Act, it decided that instead of

22

creating a set of substantive rules to regulate work places,

23

that the best way to protect employees and to further labor

24

peace, was to encourage the parties to really make their own

25

charter for industrial relations.

When Congress enacted the

13

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

One is the

Corporation

628-4888

1

And so Congress imposed the duty to bargain, and it

2

delimited the subjects of bargaining.

3

parties that so long as the agreement you make is a lawful

4

agreement, you are free to make that agreement and our role is

5

to enforce the agreement, because we think that that is the way

6

for the most conducive set of labor relations.

7

QUESTION:

And then it said to the

Is that any different from what the law

8

says with regard to any contract?

9

disposition of their affairs.

It favors private

You can say the same thing about

10

an ordinary non-labor contract:

11

parties themselves provideup to a point.

12

MR. SILBERMAN:

we will enforce what the

I think the difference is this,

13

Justice Scalia.

14

principle of freedom of contract, but there is not a duty to

15

bargain, for example, outside of the labor relations context.

16

in the ordinary contract context there is a

Congress here commanded bargaining because it viewed

17

contracting — not just it thought it was good for parties to

18

do whatever they wanted, but it thought that this system of

19

self-government was the best way to further a set of public

20

concerns, and was preferable to imposing a set of government

21

regulations on the work place.

22

So that we think that the philosophy of the NLRA goes

23

quite beyond the philosophy of the law of contracts, and that

24

the most concrete manifestation of that is the duty to bargain,

25

which is unique to the labor relations context, and which, of

14

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1
2

course, is codified in Section 885.
The other aspect of labor relations policy is this

3

encouragement of private dispute resolution, of arbitration

4

instead of litigation, and as this Court explained in the

5

Steelworkers trilogy, that reflects Congress's understanding«

6

that it is unrealistic to expect the parties at one time to sit

7

down and develop a set of rules that will govern every

8

situation that arises in this ongoing relationship.

9

And Congress said, that instead of encouraging you to

10

run to the courts to resolve these matters, or moreover,

11

instead of your resolving these matters through an ad hoc

12

adjustment of economic forces, what we think the best way to

13

deal with these is for you to get somebody who you trust, who

14

you the parties trust, and empower him to elaborate on your

15

contract and develop.a set of rules, and we will do our best to

16

enforce that system and uphold that system.

17

QUESTION;

Can he adopt the public policy principle

18

and say he will not interpret any provision of the contract to

19

be contrary to sound public policy?

20

the courts enforce it?

MR. SILBERMAN:

And if he does that, can

arbitrator and public law is is a complex question.

23

threshold, Justice Scalia, as National Academy develops in its

24

brief amicus curiae, in a discharge case the issue that is

25

entrusted to the arbitrator, the just cause issue necessarily

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

At the

1

asks the arbitrator to take into account the variety of public

2

policies.

3

Arbitrators treat cases that involve employees who

4

are dangerous very differently than they treat an employee who

5

has thrown a spitball in the plant, and they do so because they

6

have an understanding of public policy and that the party has

7

expected those kinds of considerations.

8
9

Certainly, arbitrators can do that, they should do
that, they do do that.

And it would be part of our submission,

10

the reason why in this case we think it is especially

11

inappropriate to authorize the courts into this area, is that

12

there is no principle by which a judge can say that in this

13

particular case, this individual has done something so serious

14

that he shouldn't be put back to work.

15

It requires a very particularized judgment.

You want

16

to know what he did, were there any extenuating circumstances,

17

what's his past record, what is his likelihood of repetitions

18

that's precisely the question the arbitrator asks.

19

And the arbitrator does so because the parties have

20

empowered him to do so because they trust him to render their

21

judgment for them, if you will.

22

in this area, what the courts are going to wind up doing is

23

simply redoing what the arbitrator has done, and substituting

24

not some rule of law that they can apply in any kind of neutral

25

way, but their best judgment for the arbitrator's judgment and

And if the courts get involved

Corporation

1

ultimately, for the parties' judgment.

2

And we suggest that there is no basis for taking from

3

the parties their right to make their own decisions on, at what

4

point is somebody sufficiently dangerous or sufficiently

5

harmful or sufficiently evil that he shouldn't go back to work,

6

and substituting a court's resolution of that.
A resolution which, as I say, can't be animated by

7

8

any kind of principle.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Silberman, there are examples in case

10

law where courts have overturned decisions of arbitrators for a

11

variety of reasons, including sometimes gross misjudgment.

12

Aren't there examples of that found in the case law around the

13

country?

14

MR. SILBERMAN:

Certainly since this Court's decision

15

in Enterprise Wheel, the courts have been empowered to ask, has

16

the arbitrator gone about his job of interpreting the contract

17

or is he substituting his own brand of industrial justice.

18

There is not doubt that there are cases in which the

19

courts have found that the arbitrator was not carrying out his

20

mission and have therefore overturned, and we obviously don't

21

quarrel with that.

22

And as I said at the outset, the Court of Appeals

23

here did not suggest that the arbitrator had done that, and

24

indeed, the arbitrators award here draws upon the general

25

understanding of the just cause concept.

17

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

Beyond that, there are very few cases, or at least

2

very few cases prior to the last couple of years, in which a

3

court would overturn an arbitrators award on public policy

4

grounds, except in a situation where we, and we think Judge

5

Easterbrook, acknowledge the propriety of doing that.
That is, where public law says that you can't enforce

6
7

this award.

Where the arbitrator has ordered the employer to

8

commit an unlawful act.
QUESTION:

9

Do you think that your questions presented

We obviously think it was not, for the reason you

suggesting, the courts don't have authority to do that.

We do not suggest and no party suggested at the

6

mention.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Gear, when you say it was a blatant

8

violation of public policy, oh what facts do you conclude that

9

it was blatant?

If you limit yourself — one way to look at

10

the case is just take the one sentence on page 58 of the

11

arbitrator's report, the only thing the company has proven was

12

that the Grievant was sitting in the back seat of a car in

13

which there was found a lit marijuana cigarette in the front

another company employee.

Now if — and I understand you take a different — if

17

that were the only fact, would you still make the public policy

argument?

19

MR. GEAR:

No, I wouldn't.

20

QUESTION:

So your argument depends on the fact that

21

there was also marijuana found in the back seat?

MR. GEAR:

QUESTION:

So that the asserted basis for the

established very clearly that he was in violation of the plant

that he operated the paper mill device called a slitter-

MR. GEAR:

9

QUESTION:

Would the arbitrator automatically sustain

10

a dismissal for violation of a plant rule even if he had

considered and credited all your evidence?

12

MR. GEAR:

He wouldn't automatically sustain one, no.

13

QUESTION:

He normally —

MR. GEAR:

we are dealing in an industry that, in Louisiana, has the

highest workman's compensation rating in terms of premium cost

fifteen accidents in the four years preceding this case, and

the Grievant had, in the past six months before his discharge,

MR. GEAR:

I don't think that you can say that an

Well, then why is it a violation of public

justified in relying on the evidence of marijuana in the back

seat of his car to conclude that he was a drug user who should

MR. GEAR:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

That just means that the Court of Appeals

disagrees with the arbitrator as a fact finder, on the facts.
MR. GEAR:

11

It means they disagreed with his remedy

deriving from the facts that he found.
QUESTION:

Another way, what you are saying is, if

MR. GEAR:

Then you've violated a positive law.

QUESTION:

But there's nothing — the arbitrator

doesn't offend that sort of law, because if the guy is going to

use marijuana, he offends it as much as if he has been fired as

if he is still working.

7

The fact that he is going to use marijuana, it

doesn't seem to me it increases the violation of that statute

to say that he may be using marijuana at work if all you are

10

relying on is a statute that says it's illegal to use marijuana

11

anywhere.

QUESTION:

Is that what this order was, though, to

MR. GEAR:

It was to put back to work an individual

that was found in the back seat of a car where an amount of

17

marijuana smoke existed, that had marijuana found on the

18

premises of the employer's plant in violation of the company's

rule, and I think it would put back to work a drug possessor or

probably drug user.

I just don't think an employer and the public can
risk that in a safety intensive industry.

and there was liquor spilled in the back seat, and "y" had been

sitting in the car, but there is no who actually saw "y"

drinking liquor.

14

Do you think that a fact finder is compelled to

conclude that "y" was drinking liquor just because "x” was and

16

there was liquor in the car?

MR. GEAR:

No, I don't think so, but there are cases

that hold, in the area particularly, that constructive

QUESTION:

3

Well, it is one thing to uphold a

of fact, but it is another thing to say the finder of fact must

draw that inference.

MR. GEAR:

The finder of fact in our

case, though, did find that the individual possessed marijuana

in his car, based upon the police search, though.

10

finding of fact we can rely on in this case.
QUESTION:

11
12

So we have a

And the Court of Appeals said that, based

on that evidence, the remedy was inappropriate —

13

MR. GEAR:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

— because it was contrary to public

policy to order back to work anybody whose car contains traces

of marijuana.

17

MR. GEAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And of

18

course, S. D. Warren's court in the First Circuit held, also in

19

a paper mill, also in very similar problems of marijuana usage

20

that the public policy was not served by the arbitrator's

21

reinstatement of drug users in that situation, on essential

22

identical grounds to the Misco case.

23

The Fifth Circuit held the same thing in the context

24

of the drinking truck driver in the over the road trucking

This is nothing new.

I don't think that a flexible

public policy exception will deter or interfere with the

testimony of three witnesses to the event.

everything else, the fellow has a long history of child

molestation, but in no one of these instances were there three

And the thing goes to arbitration, the arbitrator

5

says, that's the way the contract reads, you don't have the

you can't be fired.

MR. SILBERMAN:

You would not allow that?

employing a particular individual and a procedural rule in a

5

contract which leads an arbitrator to order the employment of

6

an individual who public law says is not to be employed, then

7

it is entirely consistent with — our principle would say that

award is against public policy because it is ordering the

employer to do something he is not permitted to do.
