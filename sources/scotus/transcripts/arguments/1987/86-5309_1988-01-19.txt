ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY PETERSON, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. PETERSON:

8

9

We'll hear argument next in

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
The issue in this case is whether it's constitutional

10
11

for a State to take away a preemptory challenge from a

12

defendant in a capital case, to take it away by forcing him to

13

use it to remove a juror from the jury who should have been

14

removed for cause because he was unable to consider a life

15

sentence.

16

This case was the type of case historically in which

17

preemptory challenges have been regarded as most valuable.

18

defendant was black, he was charged and tried in a virtually

19

all white community for the murder of a white police officer.

20

The trial judge specifically found that the defendant's race

21

was an issue in the trial.

22

QUESTION:

MR. PETERSON:

Had there been a change of venue granted?

MR. PETERSON:

1
2

This was in western Oklahoma, far

western Oklahoma about 150 miles west of Oklahoma City.
Although he tried to kind of remedy the publicity by

3
4

changing the venue, it turned out not to be â€” the crime

5

occurred in Elk City, Oklahoma.

6

QUESTION:

Elk?

7

MR. PETERSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PETERSON:

Elk City.

That's way out in the panhandle, isn't it?
Well, it's on Route 66 in western

10

Oklahoma.

11

which is a little town of 1300 people about 30 miles from Elk

12

City.

13

The case was actually tried in Cheyenne, Oklahoma,

He tried to remedy the publicity by changing the

14

venue but it turned out really not to have very much effect.

15

Almost all the jurors that were called had heard about the case

16

and it appeared not to have been a very effective move.

17

There was a real danger of prejudice against the

18

defendant under these circumstances, and challenges for cause

19

or not an infallible way of obtaining an impartial jury.

20

There's a real risk that some prejudice jurors are going to get

21

by challenges for cause, are going to get by voir dire, and are

22

going to get on the jury.

23

are valuable.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

That's where preemptory challenges

Well, how many were given here?
Nine.

Pardon?

Heritage

MR. PETERSON:

2

QUESTION:

Nine in first degree murder statute.

Right. And your argument essentially is

3

that one of them had to be wasted to remove the juror who

4

should have been removed for cause anyway.

5

MR. PETERSON:

6

QUESTION:

That's right.

Now, you don't deny that Oklahoma could

7

have provided only eight to begin with, or maybe even only

8

what, two to begin with?

9

any preemptory challenges at all?

10

MR. PETERSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PETERSON:

Was there any obligation to provide

No, there's not.

None at all.
There's only an obligation to have an

13

impartial trial, but I don't think that there's any particular

14

number that's required by the Constitution.

15

QUESTION:

So your contention is that it violates

16

fundamental fairness to give him only eight instead of nine,

17

that's what it comes down to?

18

MR. PETERSON:

That's right.

I think the State

19

legislature has to make a judgment of how many preemptory

20

challenges are needed in a particular State to secure a fair

21

trial.

22

pervasive in one State than another.

23

be higher in one State than another.

24
25

Pretrial publicity, the news media may be more
Juror qualifications may

So I think the fact that some States may have a
smaller number of preemptory challenges doesn't necessarily
answer the question.

I think the only way that we can be sure
5

Heritage

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

that the defendant received due process is if he got the

2

statutory number that's allowed.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

What if the Statute allowed the

prosecution ten challenges and the defense nine?
MR. PETERSON:

I think we have a problem with that.

6

That's kind of a Wardius v. Oregon situation where there are

7

non-reciprocal benefits where the State has a procedural edge

8

on the defendant in conducting a trial.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

What provision of the Constitution do you

think would be violated by that, if any?
MR. PETERSON:

The due process clause.

Wardius v.

12

Oregon was a situation where a notice of alibi statute applied

13

only to the benefit of the prosecution and not to the defense,

14

and the Court held in that situation that it was a denial of

15

due process.

16

And we think the same argument would apply here.

QUESTION:

Well, what if the Oklahoma legislature had

17

found in connection with enacting a statute, like Justice

18

O'Connor poses, that we'd looked into all the jury challenges

19

that have come up in Oklahoma, and on the average, we think the

20

typical juror is a little more prejudice in favor of the

21

defendant than in favor of the State.

22

we have empirical basis for saying that a ten:eight ratio will

23

put them back to parity.

24
25

MR. PETERSON:

And therefore, we think

It's hard for me to square that with

Wardius v. Oregon, and I guess the legislature in Oregon
concluded that the defense doesn't need this discovery as much
6

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

as the prosecution does.

2

that no State gives the prosecution more preemptory challenges

3

than the defendant, and a lot of States give the defense more.

4
5

QUESTION:

I don't think it's fair and I think

And that's how we decide.

We say, is it

fair, the way you do, is that how we decide this case?

6

MR. PETERSON:

Well, I'm not sure that the question

7

of ten versus nine really controls this case.

8

process clause question turns on whether there's been a

9

statutory right that's important enough that's been denied in

I think the due

10

this case that is entitled to the production of the due process

11

clause.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if you had eight challenges and one

13

of them was just like this and you used the preemptory on that

14

one, and you didn't use any of your other preemptories?

15

MR. PETERSON:

I think it's easier to find harmless

16

error in that situation, if the defendant didn't really need

17

the preemptories in the first place, it's hard to see how it

18

really harmed him to have to use one on this particular jury.

19
20
21
22

QUESTION:

And the difference between that one and

this one is?
MR. PETERSON:

their preemptories and asked for more, and didn't get them.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PETERSON:

25

In this case, the defense used all

Did you ask for more preemptories?
The defense lawyer asked for

additional preemptories before the trial, but under our law in
Oklahoma, the trial judge couldn't do it.

QUESTION:

1
2

I know, but he didn't after this event,

and he passed every juror, didn't he, that proceeded?
MR. PETERSON:

3

He didn't try to prove challenge for

cause against any of the jurors that were seated.

5

law, the trial judge could have given him more than nine

6

preemptory challenges and he denied it'once before and the law

7

hadn't changed between the time of the pretrial ruling and the

8

time of the stay.
QUESTION:

9

Under our

Well, do you think, couldn't the Judge

10

have, if he'd have asked and argued, the Judge could have

11

changed his mind on disqualifying for cause, and in which

12

event, the eight preemptories wouldn't have been exhausted.
MR. PETERSON:

13
14

I think that the defense attorney had

to accept the trial judge's ruling for whatever it was.

process.

Amendment?

Counsel, you've been speaking of due

I thought your case also rested on the Sixth

MR. PETERSON:

18

That's true.

We have two arguments in

19

this case.

20

requires you to use an preemptory challenge in order to remedy

21

a Sixth Amendment violation in order to enforce the right to a

22

Sixth Amendment impartial jury penalizes the exercise or the

23

enforcement of the Sixth Amendment right.

25

One is that the rule of Oklahoma procedure that

Because in this case, you came up with a

different jury than you would have had had the Judge ruled
correctly?

MR. PETERSON:

1
2

the Judge ruled correctly.
QUESTION:

3
4

It could have been a different jury if

Well, isn't it almost inevitable it would

have been?
MR. PETERSON:

5

The defense attorney certainly wanted

6

more preemptories and I think if he'd had them, he would have

7

used them.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PETERSON:

10

QUESTION:

Like one more?
He wanted one more.

Of course â€”

Does the case go off on more preemptories?

11

Doesn't it go off on the proper use of such preemptories as

12

were available to him?

13

properly to permit him to use them?

14

MR. PETERSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

He had nine and he wanted the Court

That's right.

I think we're going down a blind alley

when we speak of different numbers of preemptories.
MR. PETERSON:

The juror who was challenged for cause

18

in this case.

19

should have been removed.

20

return the death penalty upon conviction.

21

that he wouldn't consider any other possible penalty.

22

Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals specifically found that his

23

responses were unequivocal, and that it was error to seat him.

I don't think there was much dispute that he

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PETERSON:

He said twice that he was going to
He went on to say
The

Aren't we bound by that finding?
I would say since our argument depends

on a finding of a Sixth Amendment violation, that the Court has

1

the power to examine the facts and redetermine it.

2

certainly no reason to.

3

answers were unequivocal and the Oklahoma Court was certainly

4

right in its finding that it was error.
QUESTION:

5

I think that it's clear that his

This is not a First Amendment case, this

6

is a Sixth Amendment case.

7

was binding.
MR. PETERSON:

8
9

I would have thought that finding

We would be happy if the Court

considered it to be binding.
QUESTION:

10
11

There's

Of course, that juror was not, I mean, he

was seated but didn't participate in the trial, right?

12

MR. PETERSON:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.

Because one of the preemptories was used

14

to eliminate him, so basically what you're -- we really don't

15

know what the effect of this was.

16

juror might have been challenged for cause who â€” you're not

17

asserting that any of the jurors that were on the jury was

18

known to be biased on in any way contrary to your client.

19

just think if you had one more preemptory, it would have been

20

nice.

21

MR. PETERSON:

You're saying one other

You

We don't know if any of the other

22

jurors on the jury were impartial or not.

We do know that the

23

defense attorney thought they were not impartial, because he

24

specifically said that at the end of the jury selection.

25

of course, that's the type of situation where preemptory

And

challenges are most valuable, when the defense attorney thinks
10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the jurors are biased but can't sustain a challenge for cause.
So we think that the laws of a preemptory challenge

2
3

in the situation here was harmful.

4

It wasn't an option for the defense attorney just to

5

leave this juror on the jury and complain about it later on

6

appeal.

7

challenge on him in order to preserve the right.

8

used a preemptory challenge on this juror, he would have really

been stuck with the result of the trial which was with a biased

Under our Oklahoma procedural rule, he had to use a

juror.
QUESTION:

So there's no remedy at all then,

effectively?
MR. PETERSON:

As the Oklahoma Courts have treated

this, yes, that's right.
On the question of harmless error, Chapman v.

16

California says that the burden of proving that a

17

constitutional error is harmless is on the beneficiary which is

18

the State in this case.

19

is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

20

It also says that the burden of proof

While we don't have to prove anything on the harmless

21

error issue, we think that the evidence gives every indication

22

that the error was in fact a harmful one.

23

that if the defendant had another preemptory challenge, he

24

could have used it to change the composition of the membership

25

of the jury.
QUESTION:

There's no dispute

Yes, but might not the argument be made
11

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

that in order to show the argument was harmful, or not

2

harmless, you would have to show that the other juror would

3

have done something different?

4

substituting one random juror for another really.

5

passes challenge for cause.

6

something different than the one who was seated did?

7

MR. PETERSON:

What you're talking about
Each of them

That one juror would have done

I think the burden is on the State to

8

prove that the randomly selected another juror whose identity

9

we don't know, whose background, whose beliefs we don't know,

10

would have done the same thing as the actual juror.

11

it's impossible for them to show that.

12

I think

It's unclear that a harmless error analysis can ever

13

be applied in a situation like that.

14

selection cases going back to Strauder v. West Virginia have

15

never tried to figure out what another juror would have done,

16

or how he would have decided the case if the Constitutional

17

error in jury selection had not occurred.

18

unprecedented for the Court to try to apply a harmless error

19

analysis in that situation.

20

This Court's jury

I think it would be

The evidence in this case was in conflict on the

21

issue of guilt and the murder charge.

22

he did not intend to kill the decedent.

23

that testimony, they would have to acquit him of murder.

24

there is conflicting evidence on the sentencing issue as well.

25

QUESTION:

The defendant said that
If a jury accepted
And

Did you represent the defendant on appeal?

MR. PETERSON:

No.
12

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:

1

Was there any, at any time, a statement by

2

the attorney for the defendant that had he had another

3

preemptory, he would have used it, and he would have used it

4

against Mr. X or Mrs. Y?
MR. PETERSON:

5

No, there was not, it's not in the

6

record, no.

And of course, that's part of our argument on the

7

harmless error case, is that that type of statement, even if it

8

was made in the way that the Oklahoma Court asked for it,

9

wouldn't prove anything.
QUESTION:

10

Well, it would prove something if the

11

lawyer said, if a judge happened to ask the lawyer representing

12

him on appeal, would you have used your preemptory to challenge

13

anyone on that jury, and if so, who, and if he said, I wouldn't

14

have used it, that's certainly harmless error, I suppose?
MR. PETERSON:

15
16

that case.

17

simply â€”

I agree, it would be harmless error in

But what the defense attorney did in this case was

18

QUESTION:

He didn't say anything.

19

MR. PETERSON:

Well, he said he believed that the

20

jury was not impartial and it was not fair.

I don't think that

21

if he had identified a particular juror that he would have

22

challenged, that it would have proven anything under the Gray

23

v. Mississippi case.

24

trial judge made happened in the sixth round of jury selection.

25

The statement that the Oklahoma court demanded a counsel that

The reason is that the error that the

he didn't make would have been made after the ninth round.
13

Heritage

Corporation

628-4888

If the sixth round had happened differently, if a

1
2

judge had ruled differently, there could have been a bunch of

3

different jurors on the panel by the time of the ninth round.
QUESTION:

4

But when the petitioner's lawyer said he

5

didn't think the jury was impartial, he was talking not in any

6

legal sense because he agreed they weren't subject to challenge

7

for cause.

8

would have liked to have try the case, don't you think?

He just meant they weren't the kind of jury he

MR. PETERSON:

9

I think what he meant was what he said

10

that it was not a fair and impartial jury.

11

not find evidence that he would need to sustain a challenge for

12

cause.

13

QUESTION:

Perhaps he could

He was speaking at least of his intuition

14

and something that he couldn't prove to the satisfaction of the

15

judge?

16
17
18
19

20

MR. PETERSON:

Apparently so, that he did not have

the proof.
QUESTION:

Counsel, was the procedural due process

claim ever made below?
MR. PETERSON:

In some sense it was.

Certainly the

21

Sixth Amendment claim was made more clearly, but counsel in the

22

lower court did invoke Swain v. Alabama and some cases like

23

that, which we think kind of recognize a due process right

24

preemptory challenge.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Peterson, I'm having some trouble with

the notion that what constitutes harm is the substitution of
14

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

one impartial juror, that is, lawfully determined to be

2

impartial, not challengeable for cause, for another impartial

3

juror.

4

causes the case to be delayed, some legal error that causes the

5

case to be delayed.

6

jury than you would have had had the case come up earlier.

7

Suppose that there's some error made by a judge that

Because it's delayed, you get a different

Now, I assume it's impossible in that case also for

8

the State ever to prove that the jury you would have gotten on

9

the earlier date would have convicted you just as the jury you

10

got on a later date is.

11

violation there, and similarly here, it seems to me that once

12

you've determined that you have seated a jury that is not

13

challengeable by cause, that is fair and impartial, hasn't your

14

client gotten substantial justice?

15

But I fail to see any constitutional

MR. PETERSON:

Well, in the trial delay situation,

16

the defendant doesn't have a right to have a particular jury

17

hear his case.

18

composition of a jury.

19
20
21

There's been no right relating to the

QUESTION:

To a particular jury to hear his case in

this instance either.
MR. PETERSON:

He does have a right to exclude

22

particular jurors from the case as a result of a preemptory

23

challenge, and the inevitable consequence of the right to

24

exclude is the right to bring on somebody to replace him.

25

I think that's a distinction.
QUESTION:

And

Well, I can think of a hypothetical under
15

'

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

the legislation requiring criminal trials to be brought on for

2

trail promptly, so you could say he's entitled to have a jury

3

selected as such and such a date, and because of some error by

4

the Government, he isn't tried in time, how could you ever

5

prove that the different jury he got would not have come out to

6

a different result?

7

MR. PETERSON:

One way to look at it, I guess, is the

8

nature of the preemptory challenge right as opposed to some

9

statute that just requires that a trial begin on such and such

10

a date.

A preemptory challenge is a right that this Court,

11

itself, has said that this is one of the most important rights

12

secured to the accused.
QUESTION:

13

But here it's only a State law right,

14

isn't it?

15

Constitutional principle that requires preemptory challenges?

16

You're not contending that there's any Federal

MR. PETERSON:

That's right, but it's still an

17

important right, and this Court has said so in its own

18

decisions.

19

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but you agree that Oklahoma wouldn't

have had to accord any preemptory challenges at all?
MR. PETERSON:

21

That's right.

It is an important

22

right.

It has six and a half centuries of history behind it.

23

I think it is regarded as a basic, a fundamental right of the

24

criminal justice system.

QUESTION:

Whereas, perhaps some other State

Mr. Peterson, if there had been one

7

preemptory challenge that the defendant didn't exercise, would

8

you be here?

9

MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

10

That's a harder case.

You said there might have been quite a

11

difference in the jury, there might have been several different

12

jurors.

13

But what if there'd been one preemptory left over?
MR. PETERSON:

There are tactical reasons why a

14

And we think that that pretty much disposes of their

13

On the question of whether an additional preemptory

Amendment, what he was deprived of under the Sixth Amendment,

5

you say, was an impartial jury, by seating the biased juror

incorrectly, right?

7

MR. PETERSON:

No.

What we say on the Sixth

Amendment argument is that the state impermissibly burdened the

9

enforcement of the Sixth Amendment right by requiring the

10

defendant to use up preemptory challenges, all of them, in

order to preserve his right to obtain appellate review on the

that States may have as many as nine preemptory challenges is

that it's always a close call whether somebody ought to be

I might invite your attention to the Stott case which

And the Court of Criminal Appeals cited an even older case from

1908 for the proposition that if there has been an error on a

19

challenge for cause, you're still required to purge that juror

20

with a preemptory challenge.

21

And I think that that is a sensible rule.

It's

sensible for both the State and for the defendant.

sensible for the State because it eliminates errors early on.

You don't have to worry about having tried a case perhaps

And it's beneficial to the defendant in the sense

3

that it requires a defendant to act in his own best interest

and remove that potentially biased juror from his jury.

5

QUESTION:

I don't understand what the relevance of

this is?

7

9

you're required to use to correct judge's errors in seating

10
11

Are you saying that it's the law of Oklahoma not that

jurors, is that what the law is?
MR. NANCE:

Your Honor, it's relevant, I believe,

12

because of one of the arguments made by petitioner under Logan

13

v. Zimmerman Brush which was in that case, the State law

14

created a right to a hearing and that that right had been

15

deprived by an established State procedure essentially a short

16

statute of limitations to set a hearing.

17

State law here that you have to use a preemptory, but unlike in

18

Logan, in Logan it was arbitrary, it was irrational and almost

19

bizarre that the plaintiff didn't get his handicapped

23

24
25

That's the distinction and really the

The petitioner also relies on Hicks v. Oklahoma,
which I'd like to distinguish very briefly.

In Hicks, this

Court reversed a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Appeals because the Oklahoma statutory right â€” not a

2

constitutional right or a direct constitutional right -- but

3

there was an Oklahoma statutory right to jury sentencing, and

4

the Court in that case said that the due process clause would

5

protect that statutory right because it created a substantial

6

and legitimate expectation that you would not be deprived of

7

your life and liberty in that case except by a jury.

8
9
10
11

We think that the provision of preemptory challenges
doesn't create such a substantial and legitimate expectation of
practical control over a deprivation of life or liberty.
The petitioner's rule, I think, as Justice White

12

pointed out, would almost require a trial judge to be perfect

13

in his rulings for cause, because if he made a mistake and then

14

the defendant had to use a preemptory challenge on that, there

15

would be necessarily constitutional error.

16

that's a good rule, and I don't really think that is the law.

MR. NANCE:

No blacks on the panel at all, I see.

It is, Your Honor, I think, if you're

2

hypothesizing there could have been a black waiting in the

3

wings.
QUESTION:

4
5

It's unlikely that there might have been a

little prejudice around?
MR. NANCE:

6

No, I'm saying it's unlikely that just by

7

the luck of the draw, there would have been black jurors ready

8

in that county to come on.

9

black jurors were excluded improperly, either from the veneer

10

or from the trail jury.
Justice Stevens is correct.

11

12

There is no allegation here that

We don't have a Batson

problem here.
Back to the trial counsel, he did not argue as he

13
14

could have done that the ruling for cause was incorrect, and he

15

did not ask to have that preemptory challenge returned to him.

16

And his only complaint afterwards was that the jury contained

17

no blacks and that he thought his client couldn't get a fair

18

trial from a jury of his peers.

19

say, there's no Batson problem with improper racial exclusion

20

here.

21

Although again, I hasten to

The Court has stated that the Constitution

22

presupposes a jury chosen from a cross section of the community

23

is impartial if the jurors can conscientiously and properly

24

discharge their duty under the law.

25

petitioner's argument in this case, there is no argument that

As I understand

it wasn't selected from a cross section, or that the jurors

Basically, the petitioner wants a reversal without

2
3

any showing of prejudice. We think that would be senseless, it

4

would be wasteful, and it would particularly be senseless and

5

wasteful if there was no violation of the Constitution.
I'd like very briefly to distinguish the Gray case

6

which petitioner relies on.

8

unlike this case, a Witherspoon error, that is, there had been

9

a juror improperly excluded and at least theoretically, there

had been a tribunal empaneled to return a verdict of guilt.
In that case, this Court said that there could be no

11
12

harmless error, and if the error itself caused any change in

13

the composition of the jury, it would have to stand.

14

the petitioner's rule of automatic reversal in this case

15

wrenches that no-harmless-error language from Gray from its

16

foundation of a Witherspoon error and wants to engraft it in

17

this case where there has been no such error, and no such

death-prone jury empaneled.

I think

This Court stated that when a juror is tried to an

2

MR. NANCE:

3

QUESTION:

No, they did not say that.
Mr. Nance, would it not be true that the

4

same reasoning, if you say, well, the jury that was empaneled

5

was all free of bias because there's no challenges for cause,

6

that you could give the same answer if the Judge had simply

said, I think I'll only let you have seven preemptories, and

8

the other have nine.

9

only going to give you seven because I think you only really

I know the law requires nine, but I'm

11

this particular denial, it seems to me, was rather flagrantly

12

wrong.

13
14
15
16

Because his ruling on

And that would be a rather flagrant error too.
Wouldn't the reasoning say that you haven't shown

that your jury was not impartial, so that's just too bad?
MR. NANCE:

I think that would be worse than what we

have here, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. NANCE:

Why?
Because on the one hand, more like Logan

v. Zimmerman Brush, that would just be an arbitrary and

20

irrational sort of thing for a Judge to say.

QUESTION:

Well, this is pretty extreme here.

He

says, the juror says no matter what the evidence shows, I'm

more flagrant error in denying a challenge for cause than that,

that the jury that's on there is a pretty good sound jury,

they're all local citizens that are unbiased, and I think you

QUESTION:

Well, â€”
They might reverse it in the State Court,

MR. NANCE:

I think it would come to a point, and

I think this Court

has said the appearance of fairness is important.

You're for fundamental justice?
Yes, sir, and I think this was a

fundamentally fair trial.
QUESTION:

And where in the world do you find that in

the Constitution or any place else?
MR. NANCE:

Well, Your Honor, I find it in cases like

21

Donnelly v. DeChristofor where this Court says that when an

22

error not specifically of constitutional origin like I think

23

we've conceded here, about preemptory challenges, only merits

24

reversal â€”

25

Well, fundamental justice says there's no

Fundamental justice is what the people

want.

And you said, yes.

2

sure you didn't.
MR. NANCE:

3
4

I don't think you mean that.

You are rapidly persuading me that I

didn't mean it, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

What I meant was â€”

You're worried about a sentence of death

6

plus life.

7

you execute both of those sentences?

9

How do you do that?

MR. NANCE:

8

I'm

How do you do that?

Well, I don't know, Your Honor.

How do

I guess

if you execute the death, the life sentence becomes moot.

But

10

when I think of fundamental fairness, I think of cases like

11

Donnelly where unless the error infects the whole trial and

12

makes it fundamentally unfair, there's no justification for

13

reversal. And I really think that's the standard in the present

14

case.
The central purpose in a criminal trial is the fair

15
16

and rational determination of guilt.

17

here.

18

That was certainly done

Guilt was fairly and accurately established in both

19

phases.

20

anything first hand about the crime had a chance to testify.

21

In the sentencing phase, both sides had an opportunity to put

22

on their testimony either in aggravation or in mitigation.

23

In the guilt phase, virtually everyone who knew

QUESTION:

Perhaps this is repetitious, Mr. Nance,

24

but all those arguments would equally apply if the Judge had

25

simply said I'm not going to allow the defense any preemptory
challenges.

All those arguments would still be available.
40

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

The

1

reasoning of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals would be available.

2

The only thing that would be different is that it wouldn't seem

3

so trivial because it's nine instead of one.

4
5
6

But analytically, it would be precisely the same
issue, I think.
MR. NANCE:

Well, analytically, Your Honor, under the

7

standard I think should apply, that of the fundamental fairness

8

standard, the result at least in my mind ought to be different

9

because â€” I don't want to get into fundamental justice here.

10
11

QUESTION:

Because the judge looks biased in the case

that I put.

12

MR. NANCE:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.
And you're not willing to say he looks

14

biased in the case before us where he says I have no trouble

15

with a juror who is perfectly willing to say in advance that he

16

would impose the death sentence no matter what the evidence is.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Of course, in that example, the State is

treating one defendant differently than others.
MR. NANCE:

That's correct.

And while the Judge

20

clearly made a mistake, I don't think there's anything in the

21

remainder of this record that indicates bias on his part.

22

you look at his challenges for cause, he let off a number that

23

would have prejudiced the defense on his own.

24

believe three challenges for cause for the defense and several

25

for the State.

He sustained I

He pretty well went right down the middle.

QUESTION:

if

1

differently from others in your case, too.

2

effect by his incorrect ruling deprived this defendant of one

3

of the preemptories.

4

question, whether fundamental fairness means that you treat all

5

of the criminal defendants exactly the same, or whether it

6

means something less than that, that is that the process, even

7

though it might be somewhat less than another criminal

8

defendant got, is nevertheless a fundamentally fair one.

9

Isn't that basically what you have to support?

10

MR. NANCE:

11

QUESTION:

I mean, he's in

So you really do have to confront the

Yes, sir.
That equivalence is not a part of, precise

12

equivalence is not a part of fundamental fairness is what

13

you're saying?
MR. NANCE:

14

That's right.

The Court has repeatedly

15

stated that defendant's entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect

16

one.

17

defendants, we could never do it.

18

If we had to have exactly the same trial for different
It would just be impossible.

In conclusion, I think that the Court's error, or the

19

error as it was corrected by use of the preemptory challenge

20

was not an error of constitutional dimension.

21

the trial fundamentally unfair.

22

Court's inquiry under its narrow due process standard and

23

jurisdiction to reverse constitutional errors should cease.

24
25

Nor did it make

And in my mind then, this

We did not burden the right to an impartial jury any
more than well simply the use of that preemptory challenge made
an impartial jury a reality.

It helped to effectuate an

2

sort of due process problem here, I think because of the weight

of the evidence, the almost acknowledged impartiality of the

trier of fact and the presence of counsel for the defense, that

error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under either

analysis, my analysis or harmless error analysis.
