ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. LAZARUS:

Mr. Lazarus, you may

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
Thus case presents a straightforward question of

9
10

statutory construction, whether a court may order the Secretary

11

of Health and Human Services to withhold a portion of past due

12

benefits owed a financially needy claimant under Title XVI of

13

the Social Security Act and pay those benefits directly to the

14

claimant's attorney as an attorney's fee.

15

The Secretary of Health and Human Services has

16

concluded that the court is without such authority under

Title

construction.

In May 1982, Respondent Mary Alice Galbreath applied

for Supplemental Security Income disability benefits, or SSI,
under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.

Her financial need was

In August 1983, Ms. Galbreath, represented by her

counsel, brought this action in Federal District Court

challenging the agency's determination.

Ms. Galbreath was in fact disabled.

remanded the case to the agency with instruction that it

benefits owed to her.
On July 23rd, 1985, the agency accordingly sent her

a check for approximately $8000.
One week later, her counsel filed with the District

Court a motion for an attorney's fee award out of her past due

21

of his client's past due benefits, or approximately $2000.

The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's

order, but on a different ground.

concluded that courts possess inherent authority to order the

Secretary to withhold a portion of Ms. Galbreath's benefits

and pay those benefits to her counsel.

It is from that

2

judgment that we sought this Court's review.
In our view, Congress deny courts the authority, in

3
4

Title XVI, to order the Secretary to revert to a claimant's

5

attorney a portion of the claimant's SSI benefits.

6

plain intent is evident from the statutory language and from

7

the legislative history.

8

Congress specifically considered the possibility of granting

9

courts authority to order withholding and declined to do so.

Congress's

Indeed, the latter shows that

Congress determined that withholding would be

10
11

contrary to the purpose of the SSI program, which is to provide

12

benefits to the financially needy.

Excuse me?

Is your argument that Title IV repeals

there are several prohibitions,

withholding provisions were rremoved, while most of the rest of
Section 406 was carefully rettained.
Congress, moreover,, explained why, the reasons in
the accompanying legislative

reports.

Congress stated its

8

Acme Reptorting Company

9

view, speaking to the administrative proceedings, that

2

withholding would be contrary to the purpose of the program.

3

The purpose, again, unlike for Title II, is to provide

4

benefits to financially needy' persons, Title II -- Title XVI

5

benefits, unlike Title II, be:ing needed to meet basic

6

subsistence needs.
Congress decided thiat withholding those benefits

7

8

from those needy persons was not warranted, as it had been in

9

Title II.

Not surprisingly,

Respondent concedes that

10

Congress denied the courts thie power to order withholding when

11

Congress first enacted Title XVI in 1972.

12

contends that Congress somehow revisited the issue and decided

13

to allow withholding when it amended Title XVI in 1976.

14

claim, we believe, does not w/ithstand serious scrutiny.

Respondent, however,

The

The amendment upon which Respondent relies had

15
16

absolutely nothing to do withi attorney's fee withholding.

In

17

1972, Congress had decided thiat the Secretary's administrative

18

determinations under Title XV/I would be subject to judicial

19

review, as they were under Tiitle II, with one exception.

20

determination of any fact by the Secretary would be final and

21

not subject to judicial review.

In 1976, Congress emended the law to omit that

exception.

That was the extent of the revision.

fee provisions of Title II care in Section 406.
If Congress had o:riginally in 1972 made the

3

standards of judicial review exactly the same, no serious

5

claim could have been made :in the face of the language and

6

legislative history of 1972 that Congress had by that action

reasons wholly unrelated, tio attorney's fee withholding does

not add any credence to that theory.

13

with it at all, do you suppose the judge would have inherent

14

authority to enter such an order?

there is a sovereign immunity aspecto to it.

MR. LAZARUS:

1

The Secretary -- that issue is not

2

presented in the case, but it. is the Secretary's view that the

3

Court could; that we do not i.nterpret the statute as

interfering with that inherenit authority.

do anything.

We believe it

It doesn't run into the

The legislative: history speaks to the issue of

And finally, to the: extent that Congress spoke in

9
10

the statute at all to ceilingrs, it actually authorized the

11

Secretary to do just that for- administrative proceedings,

12

and all the courts actually aire in agreement on that question,

13

that the courts do have the inherent authority.

14

believe that presents a different issue not raised here.

And we

In sum, the sole quaestion in this case is whether

15
16

the Secretary's construction of Title XVI is reasonable.

17

Because it is supported by thie language, by the structure of

18

the statute, and the legislative history, which show that

19

Congress considered and rejected attorney's fee withholding

20

in the context of Title XVI,

21

decision of the Court of Appeals, therefore, should be

reversed.

we believe that it is.

And of course, the

social security law is a

5

a lot of attorneys who won't

And of course, you

This --

10

there is a bureaucracy problem with your attorney's fee,

11

whether it's an SSI or a TitlLe II, and whether it's at the

12

administrative level.

13

level, and you're not happy w^ith your attorney's fee, you can

appeal it one step.

15

and the Social Security Admimistration right now is reducing

If youi win a case at the administrative

And of course, when you get it into

And you probably arre asking yourselves why I didn't

file an EAJA fee petition andl then file my other fee petition,

20

you see, because under the Eq^ual Access to Justice law, an

21

attorney is supposed to file

that EAJA first.

22

to do that, and I know that,

and I know it in this case here.

But I couldn't raise that isssue if I had filed EAJA and the

judge would have granted my EEAJA petition.

He's supposed

Then I would not
That would have

ended.

So I just went ahead and filed a claim for my one

2

fourth of past due benefits, based on an hourly rate.
QUESTION:

3

And —

And this claim is more valuable to you

4

than an EAJA claim because you don't have to show for this one

5

that the government's position was not substantially justified

6

in this —

7

MR. BARTELS:

You don't have to show that, Your

8

Honor, and also I have a lot of other Title XVI cases whose

9

fees I know I'll get if I get this Court to approve that.

10
11

That's the reason, Your Honor.
Now, I had a case recently, an SSI case recently,

12

where a man, after seven years of litigation, he died.

13

was an SSI case.

14

made the award, I — and paid him, I could have maybe gotten

15

my money from him.

16

discovered his death, and no payment made by the Social

r

Security Administration under Title XVI, I immediately filed

18

an EAJA fee petition to get paid for what I did in the federal

court level.

I got about $1200 off that case, working with that older,

21

They hadn't made the award yet.

That

But I had — I went ahead, when I

I won't get anything at the administrative level

That's what my -- I really

Now, so I filed an EAJA real quick in that one. So
you see, if the client dies before the money comes, you don't

get anything.

That's the lav/.

And I daresay about 50 percent

of the people I represent amd get on social security are dead

within three years.
I have the -- I can definitely tell you that.

3

Most

4

people don't last very long, where they are sick, disabled.

5

And you don't go into federal court and try to get a

6

substantial evidence case overturned without having a good

7

case.

8
9
10
11

You'll go broke prac+ticing law doing that out there.
Nov/, I'd like to italk a little bit more about the

Social Security Administration's attitude about attorney's
fees; that is to say, first, they deny the people; the people
get in a lawyer v/ho gets them on.

Then they say, well, now

12

you got the money coming, we're going to regulate the fees.

13

the ciient, we made a mistake, we

undercalculated by 6000, we 're mailing a check, client
directly, $6000.

You don't get any of it, we're sorry, we

made a mistake.
I've had that hapjpen to me, and I attached two more
in my briefs, a case where ithat has happened before, too.
What I'm saying i;s, the administration, the Social
Security Administration, is

taking a very hard attitude

towards attorneys getting p<aid.

And if you'll read books on

The Reid case came down in '84.

They said the court

had the power to do -- to oxder the Social Security

Administration to withhold.
At that point, shortly after, and this is referred

MR. BARTELS:

1

Sure.

Now, Judge, let me -- because,

2

you know, when this legisla-tion comes down, the Social

3

Security Administration has their representatives there at

4

that hearing, too.

5

Congress was missing the po:int here, and didn't rule on it.

6

They stayed silent, Congresis had to adjourn, the boys had to

7

go back to their home fieldis to run for office.

8

course, well, Social Security says, we'll cover that with a

9

regulation.

And they politick, and they saw where

They wanted to come up with another regulation to make
It s.aid in there, we do not — and I've

Even if you

19

government in contempt to g.et that check out.

20

of the things you run into in the practice of law.

2

-

But the circuits are split.

Those are some

The First Circuit says

2:

no, the government doesn't have the — have to pay the checks,

25

because the court doesn't hiave the inherent authority.

2<

25

The Third Circuit's the Reid case.
Heckler says yes, they do.

Motley vs.

Galbreath vs. Bowen
19

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628-4888

says yes.

20

1

And the McCarthy and Howard out of the Sixth and Seventh

2

Circuits say to the contrary.

3

Now, when they first passed this social legislation

4

for disability back in the early '40s, they forgot to put in

5

there whether the court could order it to be withheld.

6

it took a court decision back then, which our counsel referred

7

to earlier — it was the court decision of Celebrezze vs.

8

Sparks, which came down on March 16th of '65, and that case

9

held that court did have the inherent authority to order those

10
11

And

payments made out of Title II benefits.
Then, later -- now that decision was in March of

12

'65 — then in May, April and May of '65, Social Security

13

Administration lobbyists did appear before a Senate committee

14

and said yes, we think it's all right to go ahead and do that,

15

but there should be a cap on the lawyer fees.

16

with the 25 percent cap on past due benefits.

17
18
19

So they came up

Now, that's great if you won every social security
case you took.

But you take 10 cases out there, and you got

to be pretty good sometimes to figure out, pick the winners,

20

because you pick a lot of losers, you're going to go broke

21

practicing lav/ now, and we all know that.

22
23
24
25

That's -- but you take 10 cases.

You lose three of

them, you don't get paid for it.

So there's no past due

benefits to take any fee out of.

You got seven you win, so —

and of course, if you hit a big fee on social security cases,
20

Acme Reporting Company
(202)

21

1

you don't automatically get one fourth of the past due

2

benefits.

3

You have to submit an hourly fee petition, and then they take

4

a look at the hours you worked.

That's just the amount the government holds back.

Suppose a guy came in, all you had to do was

5
6

interview him, write for three or four medical reports, submit

7

them to Social Security, get them in.

8

22,000 in back pay.

based on that hourly rate.

down here, so you don't get too much net, do you?
MR. BARTELS:

18

No, no, Your Honor, but see, like this

is one case; it'll affect, oh, many, many — you don't realize

20

how big this social security system is out there.

21

say, it's a wonderful thing.

So you don't resent the expenses?

Here's why I say that.

They lost some cases on this

And I do wish Mr. Kennedy would be here, because I

And like I say, that's a hard one to overcome

But you got to -- you know, to win a social security

tries to straighten things out, but they just overlooked it.

QUESTION:

On the legislative — the legislative

history sort of indicates they didn't expect to permit the

administration to do this.

24
25

MR. BARTELS:

Well,, they were talking about the

administrative level fees.

That was, if you'll read the cases
23

Acme Reporting Company
(20)2)

628-4888

24

1

Your Honor, of — I'll read you the most recent case that was

2

adverse to my point of law, the Howard case.

3

the court states that the Social Security Administration, they

4

used the term — oh, with respect to representation before the

5

administration.

It's in the first paragraph.

And at Page 187,

See, they've

talked about your representation at the administrative level.

They even had that; they didn't talk about what happens if it

gets to court.

You're saying that the provision in

Title II was not adopted in order to permit fees to be
withheld, but rather in order to put a cap on —

MR. BARTELS:

13

QUESTION:

14

17
18
19

MR. BARTELS:

22

23
24
25

That's right.

What I'm saying is,

Your Honor, when Title II was enacted, they didn't have
anything in there about withholding for attorney's fees.
There was the Court's decision of Celebrezze vs. Sparks that
held the courts had the inherent power to do this.
Then later on, they have some social security

20
21

— the fees that had already been

declared by the courts to be withholdable?

15
16

Well, I don't know if —

hearings later on, says yes, we'll go along with that, but we
put a cap on it of 25 percent.

That's the most a lawyer can

get.
But I submit to you, the 25 percent isn't always
what you'll get.

You'll get a lot less, and that's assuming
24

Acme Reporting Company

25

1

you win the case.

2

That's just part of your office overhead.

3

where you do win and you get a big back pay award for the

4

client, but, because of the hourly rate scheme, you don't get

5

anything.
QUESTION:

You have a lot of cases out there you lose.

Does Title II have an assignment

MR. BARTELS:

Yes, and the government immunity was

decided, too?

11
12

Then you have cases

Mr. Bartels, if you lose this case, are

you going to have to disgorge?

15

MR. BARTELS:

Give the money back?

16

Well, you see, my client — I'll have to give the

17

money back to the government, and I'll try to have to get my

18

money from the client.
QUESTION:

20

Yes —

Of course, you can always go through

bankruptcy the way they do, can't you?
MR. BARTELS:

21

Well, I tell you what, a lot of

22

lawyers will think about bankruptcy who do social security

23

work if they don't get paid.

unquestionably there's big money on it.

I have that pending before the Eighth Circuit in a
case of Payton vs. Bowen.

QUESTION:

This is all fee litigation?

16

MR. BARTELS:

All fee litigation, Judge.

where they're cutting down on lawyers every day, see.

18

then, of course, once they award the fee —

and you go back through there and compute that billing time,

8

it may take six, seven hours to get all the billing time in

9

on that case.

And they don't want to pay you for that, but

10

yet you got to submit the billing time, and they want you to

11

get paid by the hour rather than by the 25 percent contingency

12

fee contract.

13

So, gentlemen, I don't want to take any more time.

14

I'm -- I just — I've had a chance to — and, believe me, I'm

25

MR. LAZARUS:

Thank you, Mr. Bartels.

I just have two very short points.

One is, of course, ultimately the wisdom of the

As to the impact of Congress's decision, one can
27

speculate that perhaps Congress hoped that the financially

2

needy would be eligible for Legal Services Corporation or
