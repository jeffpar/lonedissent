ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CLEARY, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEARY:

6
7

Court:
The reason the Petitioner chose Mr. Iredale as his

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

attorney in this case was best stated by the trial judge, who

10

said "were I in his position, I would want Mr. Iredale

11

representing me, too, because he did a fantastic job in the

12

prior trial and I can fully understand why he wanted him as his

13

attorney."

14

This case turns on the question of right to counsel

15

of choice.

I would suggest that it's a disqualification issue

16

clear and simple.

17

waived any potential conflict, and the question decided here

18

was the question as to the timing.

The issue is presented where all parties

The timing in this case was that the attorney

19
20

following basically the guidelines of Cuyler v. Sullivan

21

entered the case at the time he could, when he disposed of the

22

other two.

23

indicated I am now going — I am retained by this defendant who

24

has seen my superior trial skills and wants me.

25

independent attorney, this is not someone else, the attorney

When the second guilty plea was entered, he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

He has his

1

knows of the performance and says we want him.

2

The trial judge says, when presented initially with

3

it, if the clients have no problem and the prosecutor has no

4

problem, I see no problem.
At this time, the prosecutor said we don't plan to

5

6

call this person as a witness, but there is a potential, a

7

possibility.

8

as a witness.

No time previously was this individual considered

The following Monday, a written objection is filed to

9
10

the appearance of this attorney because (1) he would not be

11

involved, Gomez-Barajas would not be involved, but now there's

12

other person who wasn't going to be a witness will now be a

13

witness.

14

against the Petitioner.

15

information and substantiate the Government's principal witness

16

that he was a large-scale dope dealer because, in fact, he did

17

deliver marijuana to this individual's home.

18

That witness would provide no adverse information
That witness would provide adverse

The key question was, did that marijuana get to the

Petitioner's home.

20

record, and the Government just assumed that that connection

21

was sufficient to knock out counsel.

22

The answer was there was no showing in the

I think it's also important to note in this case is

23

the District Court finding, and these things are so critical

24

for, I think, an appellate tribunal.

25

said based on the representations of the Government, so there

In this case, the Court

4

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

was no factual finding.

It was assumed that what the

2

Government presented in its written papers were sufficient.
Second, I have no choice but to file -- find

3
4

irreconcilable conflict, not a discretionary, a balancing of

5

the tests.

6
7

There was no hearing.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Were any of the Government's

representations contradicted at that time?

8

MR. CLEARY:

9

Throughout the initial hearing.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor, they were.

Flat out.

Not conclusions, but representations,

11

specifically what was contradicted.

12

that the district judge was not making any evaluation of his

13

own.

14

Government's representations, there being no contradiction of

15

those.

It would be a natural way to say it based on the

I have no choice.

16

MR. CLEARY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I'm not sure that means

Right.
What factual representation was

contradicted?
MR. CLEARY:

The factual representation was

20

contradicted, first, as to Mr. Iredale being -- I mean, Mr.

21

Wheat, the Petitioner, being a possible witness against Mr.

22

Gomez-Barajas, if his deal fell through.

23

the non-marijuana charges.

24

and the Government's representation was that, gee whiz, if that

25

fell apart, Mr. Wheat might be a possible witness against Mr.

The arrangement as to

That is to say, the other charges

5

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

Gomez-Barajas, and on that record, we have flatly contradicted

2

by the assertions of Mr. Iredale that there is no way he could

3

be a witness in that transaction.

4

So, we do have a classic confrontation.

5

QUESTION:

6

Were they talking about the prosecution

calling him as a witness or the defense?

7

MR. CLEARY:

No.

In that case, Your Honor, there was

8

an assertion by the prosecutor that he thought there might be a

9

possibility.

However, in his written statement of which the

10

judge based the decision on, he stated only as to the deal.

11

think both sides acknowledged that Gomez-Barajas would not be a

12

witness.

13

QUESTION:

Well, is that somewhere in the record?

I

So

14

that we know that the District Court credited that rather than

15

the Government's representation?

16

MR. CLEARY:

Well, the Government didn't say he was

17

going to be called as a witness.

18

reason that Gomez-Barajas was going to be involved was if the

19

plea fell apart, then the Petitioner might be a possible

20

government witness against Gomez-Barajas.

21

The Government said that the

The Government, in its representation to the Court,

22

did not even suggest that Mr. Gomez-Barajas would be a witness

23

for them or the defense.

24
25

QUESTION:

Perhaps I'm just not getting all of it,

but in your answer to Justice Scalia's question, you say the
6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Government.

2

witness.

The Government represented that someone might be a

MR. CLEARY:

3

That's — maybe there's — there's two

4

individuals. Gomez-Barajas and Bravo.

5

the trial.

6

Bravo was a witness in

There's no question as to that.
QUESTION:

But when the Government is speaking before

7

the trial, all they can do is represent as to possibilities.

8

They can't say in fact yes, he will surely be called.

9

MR. CLEARY:

Well, I think in the sequence in this

10

case, sticking to the record that we have on the 22nd of

11

August, the statement of the -- at the first time Bravo entered

12

a plea and indicating that now Mr. Iredale is the attorney for

13

the Petitioner, the Government says, at this time, we have no

14

plans to call him.

15

have the trial the following week.

They already made the adjudication.

They

There is the possibility.

16

So, I think at this time, what we have so close to

17

the trial after the plea is entered an indication that he is

18

not a viable true-to-form and anticipated witness.

19

20

QUESTION:

representation shortly after that, didn't they?

21

MR. CLEARY:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Then, the Government changed its

That's correct.
And are you saying that the Government's

second representation was contradicted?
MR. CLEARY:

Yes.

No.

I think the defense said,

yes, he is going to be calling him as a witness. What was the
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

contradiction was as to whether or not that witness would give

2

evidence that would, in effect, be adverse towards the

3

Petitioner.
And I think that the concern was that what the

4
5

witness had to say and in the case we had -- and what's

6

important, I think, is the time sequence on this.

7

case, Mr. Iredale represented Gomez-Barajas. In April of 1985,

8

some several months before, appointed counsel represented the

9

witness Bravo.

The original

Bravo relieved the appointed counsel and at

10

that time, Mr. Iredale was representing two defendants with the

11

approval of the court and no objection from the Government.
And I think then to see the sequence of events where

12

13

they have no objection to multiple representation as such, to

14

shift after Iredale has successfully engaged them and really

15

done damage to their witnesses, the same witnesses the

16

Petitioner would be facing, changed the ball park.

17

I think, further, that what the Court also said after

18

it found an irrebuttable presumption of conflict, it said no

19

waiver is possible.

20

intelligent knowing and voluntary waiver, which I think is an

21

appropriate inquiry for a court, but said no waiver is

22

possible.
QUESTION:

23

It didn't say a question about an

Mr. Cleary, did you ask for a hearing?

24

The trial is on Tuesday and these arguments are taking place on

25

Monday.

Did you ask for an evidentiary hearing?
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. CLEARY:

What happened was, Your Honor, that at

2

first, the previous Thursday is when Bravo, the witness,

3

entered the plea, and the court indicated it had no objection

4

and at that time, the representations were made that all

5

parties involved had consent and the court said, but I will

6

give the Government an opportunity to object if it wishes to

7

object, and what had happened is the Government filed the

8

written paper, the memoranda, on the following Monday.

9

The trial was scheduled for Tuesday, and at that

10

time, on Monday, given the Government's objections, the court

11

never inquired as to a hearing and the offer was made and there

12

was a clear cut offer of proof, that these individuals would

13

testify that they (1) had no conflict and that they were

14

willing to waive any type of conflict, potential or actual.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Am I correct that you did not ask for an

evidentiary hearing?

You just submitted it on offers of proof?

MR. CLEARY:

I think that they asked for the question

18

of taking a waiver, but I think the judge foreclosed it by

19

saying waivers are not possible.

20

be said as to the nature of the conflicts or their intelligent

21

waiver was never considered below.

22

So, the inquiry of what could

I think that in this case, the representation as to
%

23

conflict are minimal.

I think that the concern is we

24

a double standard.

Cuyler, this Court found where we had

25

two attorneys representing three defendants, and the first one

In

have like

1

went first to trial and was convicted of murder.

The attorney-

2

still representing the other two and found that there was

3

multiple representations.

4

The court held that multiple representation doesn't

5

work to the disadvantage, that the right to counsel of choice

6

is that it's a benefit.

7

who your attorney might be.

8

least some concern given for the deference that was owed to the

9

choice of the client and the attorneys involved.

10

You should have the ability to choose
In that opinion, there was at

In Cuyler, we had a situation where there was a

11

potential conflict and this Court found an implicit waiver.

12

this case, we suggest that what we have at most is a

13

speculative or potential conflict and should it not be able to

14

be overcome by an expressed waiver, --

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, you're not suggesting that in

16

a voluntary knowing waiver on the part of a defendant is the

17

final answer to any conflict, are you?

18

guarantee the selection of this particular lawyer?

19

MR. CLEARY:

In

That that ought to just

I am suggesting that a knowing

20

intelligent and voluntary waiver, I mean one fully explored by

21

the court, --

22
23

QUESTION:

I think the question asked you can be

answered yes or no, and then you can explain your answer.

24

MR. CLEARY:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
You say that a voluntary knowing
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

intelligent waiver can concludes the matter?

2

MR. CLEARY:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLEARY:

Yes, Your Honor.

If I can give an

example.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CLEARY:

9

Even though you could say there would be a

conflict?

5
6

Yes.

Yes.
The famous Loeb Leopold case was two

University of Chicago law students who murdered a young boy,

10

and they both made accusations, one accusing the other.

11

picked a single attorney, Clarence Darrow, to represent them,

12

and could the prosecutor come in and move to disgualify like

13

here, on the grounds that there would be a conflict of interest

14

between the two or should not the two be allowed to make the

15

choice that may be notwithstanding the conflict, their best

16

interests might be served by a state escaping the scaffold, and

17

I think that in that context, we could have an actual conflict

18

that can be waived.

19

20
21

In the context of this case before the Court now, my
suggestion is there's only two potential conflicts.
QUESTION:

But how about, you know, the ABA standards

22

on conflicts, state bar standards on conflicts?

23

are not favored, to put it mildly.

24
25

They

MR. CLEARY:

You know, they

The standards the Court refers to is

that they lean towards, and I would say as a general rule, the
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

preference is to have separate counsel, and to that extent,

2

where I track the other lawyers.

3

However, each one of those professional rules gives

4

way and defers to the right of the defendant to choose, and I

5

think that we have to protect that right.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CLEARY:

Even in the face of a known conflict?
Even in the face of a known conflict.

8

Would I be in a better position to choose my attorney or have

9

the Government choose the attorney for me?

And I think given

10

that tension, I would like to think I could choose my own

11

attorney.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but you can carry that to -- you can

13

say, you know, my real favorite is someone who isn't admitted

14

to the bar.

15

MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor is correct.

I think there's

16

-- the Court, I think, in Chandler v. Fretaq referred to it as

17

an unqualified right.

18

counsel and, therefore, would have to be a lawyer.

19

is correct.

20

Second, --

21

QUESTION:

However, I think the right to demand

Why?

Your Honor

Why? I mean, on your theory, if I

22

think someone who is not a lawyer is better, the only reason we

23

demand a lawyer is to protect the defendant even when he

24

doesn't want to protect himself.

25

that he'll be better off with his non-lawyer.

He thinks he knows better,

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

MR. CLEARY:

1

I would have to stick to the terms of

2

the Constitution which said counsel, and I think that the

3

meaning and understanding of counsel at the time it was adopted

4

in 1791 would mean a lawyer, and also at that time would mean

5

also the right to choose a lawyer because this Court really

6

didn't evolve the alternative appointed counsel until Powell v.

7

Alabama.

8

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, do you think the public has no

right to have a trial proceeding that appears in all respects

10

to be fair, including not having an attorney represent two

11

defendants if there is an apparent conflict of interest?

12

MR. CLEARY:

I think that the public's interest has

13

to be balanced against those on trial.

14

problem as to, and this gets into the issue of was it an

15

intelligent waiver, a knowing waiver or a voluntary waiver, I

16

think the Court can interject itself, and there are decisions,

17

for example, when the individual might be an attorney that's

18

involved and wants to represent both people.

19

I think if there was a

I think there are some questions as to whether or not

20

that would be voluntary by virtue of the relationship.

21

suggestion is that the public would be more scornful, that if

22

prosecutors could come in and move to disqualify the best

23

qualified defense lawyers and think that the person has to take

24

someone other than the person's choice of counsel, when, in our

25

system, we face in a criminal context the Government.
13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

My

And you have to think that the person who is with you

1
2

is your advocate, your soldier, your protector.
QUESTION:

3
4

Do you base your alleged right entirely on

the Sixth Amendment?
MR. CLEARY:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that the Sixth

6

Amendment as developed by this Court, and I think it's rather

7

clear cut and I think, if anything, I'm here with the pristine

8

pure right to counsel because I have 1791.

9

the authorities, what you had was only the right to counsel of

10

When you look at

choice.
In Powell v. Alabama, 1932, this Court held that due

11
12

process because the Sixth Amendment didn't apply to the states,

13

that there was a right to appointed counsel in a death case,

14

but Alabama already had it, and you evaluated it, and you said

15

that the right to counsel at that time existed only by statute.

16

'42 Betts v. Brady didn't find it, said no, doesn't apply.
QUESTION:

17

The Government takes the position that the

18

right to counsel of choice, if it exists at all, is not found

19

in the Sixth Amendment, but in due process.
MR. CLEARY:

20

I would suggest that the argument was

21

evolved by this Court in the context of the due process

22

application because the only way it could be extended to the

23

states would be through the Fourteenth Amendment due process

24

clause.

25

So, I would say in embryonic form, that was the only
14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

justification.

I think since Gideon, it's very clear that the

2

Sixth Amendment inheres in the right to counsel, so that you

3

have it applied to the states.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Government says that entitles

5

you to adequate legal representation, but doesn't extend to a

6

choice.

7

MR. CLEARY:

I would say that I am not in a position

8

to comment on the due process clause under the Fifth as was

9

applied in the case when I had the Sixth, which, in historic

10
11

traditional concept, gives the right to counsel of choice.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Court before — before

12

the Court grants the request to appoint this counsel, can

13

demand a waiver?

14

choice goes to the Court, says I want to discharge my counsel

15

and have another.

16

It sounds to me like you say counsel of

MR. CLEARY:

Well, I don't think that it can be

17

asserted in unreasonable fashion.

18

reasonable opportunity and limits could be placed on it.

19

If it's a dilatory —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CLEARY:

I think it has to be a

What kind of limits?
Well, I can only use the rule of thumb

22

of reasonable.

It should be given a reasonable opportunity to

23

assert it, and if it will not delay the trial.

24

particular case, —

25

QUESTION:

In this

Well, I know, but can the court insist on
15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

a waiver of what appears to be a conflict of interest?
MR. CLEARY:

2

If the court makes the inquiry in a

3

federal context under Rule 44(c), the court can ask if there's

4

a waiver.

5

someone. If it finds there is no waiver, then I think it has to

6

say other counsel are going to be necessary.

7
8

9

I don't think the court can force a waiver from

QUESTION:

Well, so, he could — the court could turn

it down, if there's -- if a waiver is declined?
MR. CLEARY:

If a waiver -- if there is not an

10

intelligent waiver, the court doesn't have to accept it.

11

there's joint representation, and —

12

QUESTION:

If

I take it then on your position that if

13

one of these persons is convicted and the other is acquitted,

14

the person who is convicted is a fellow who got the waiver,

15

that he is stuck with it, he just can never come back and say,

16

look, that judge shouldn't have allowed this, there was obvious

17

conflict, I was denied due process.

18

MR. CLEARY:

That was the situation in Cuyler v.

19

Sullivan, where the one who was convicted and two were

20

acquitted, and the question was this Court, and I think it was

21

over two dissents or at least commentary that there should have

22

been an inquiry by the court.

23

This Court found an implicit waiver, and in this

24

context where we have an expressed waiver by all the parties,

25

and this is not government witnesses, this is not the
16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Government like we have former federal prosecutors, and the

2

question is, yes, I think that the waiver.
This Court would have to sit down and do what it's

3
4

doing now, to go through, to make the test, is it speculative,

5

potential, actual conflict.
QUESTION:

6

Well, at least you would certainly have

7

to, in my example, you certainly then have to at least

8

relitigate again voluntariness, whether you were really

9

intelligent and whether you were informed of all the

10

circumstances, and whether you really were aware of the

11

seriousness of the conflict when you went in.
MR. CLEARY:

12

I think that there has to be an inquiry,

13

and it wouldn't have to take very long.

The question is Rule

14

11 usually takes ten to fifteen minutes as the Court knows.

15

In this type of case, we have a classic example in

16

Krebs, a Sixth Circuit case that I cited, where it was Judge

17

Peck who wrote the opinion and the trial judge was super­

18

sensitive.

19

appointed counsel available, and he did it in a matter of

20

minutes and that was the end of it, and in that case, it was an

21

actual conflict because the prosecutor intimated that the

22

attorney representing him may be involved in the criminal

23

misconduct, and I think in that context, from an appellate

24

tribunal, you would want a cleaner sanitized clear cut

25

established waiver rather than the speculation about what

Do you want other counsel appointed, you have

17
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

constitutes what type of conflict and to disqualify attorneys.

2

QUESTION:

I suppose -- would he also waive any claim

3

I thought he was going to be good, but it turns out he was

MR.

CLEARY:

I think the right to counsel of choice

is different than the right to effective assistance of counsel,

QUESTION:

Well, when trial counsel fails to object

10

to testimony or lets some in because it favors one of his

11

clients but not the other,

12

MR. CLEARY:

is that ineffectiveness?

I think that the Court, to the extent

13

that it would ask the person, do you want to fly under your own

14

flag, and I think we see judges do this all the time, do you

15

want attorney X representing you, and they say unequivocally

yes, then I think we should give the individual that choice,

I don't know how you're going to really

I think, Your Honor, that what we're

trying to suggest is that in this case, the judge used the atom

There were other procedures in this

6

as the right to counsel of choice, and we see that and I would

say it's analogous to Faretta and it's not to be measured by

Cronic or Strickland, which is the lowest minimum level of

effective assistance of counsel.

We didn't have it.

can imagine, this counsel is going to represent all three of us

12

Now, are we really going to allow that to happen?

13

MR. CLEARY:

First of all, I think the Court

14

denigrates the role of defense counsel because most of us are

15

not going to put ourselves in that situation, and in Cuyler,

16

there was a representation that certain deferences were going

17

to be.
In that situation, no defense counsel would take

18
19

himself into that position, but there can be cases where -QUESTION:

20

We have no problem if we posit that no

21

defense counsel will ever put himself in a situation of a bad

conflict.

that's the problem we're talking about.

We don't have to worry about any of this.

the Court is correct,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. KELLOGG, ESQ.

23

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. KELLOGG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
21

The absolute position taken by Petitioner is that he

1
2

has an unqualified right to waive any conflicts of interest

3

arising out of multiple representation stemming from the Sixth

4

Amendment.

5

Now, we acknowledge at the outset that a criminal

6

defendant in most cases has a right to choose any lawyer he

7

wants, but that right does not stem from the Sixth Amendment,

8

and it's an inherently qualified right.

9

right to counsel or the right to self-representation which must

It is not like the

10

be enforced directly by the Court in every serious criminal

11

case.

12

Now, the right to choose your counsel is inherently

13

subject to a number of significant qualifications which

14

Petitioner ignores.

15

may be unwilling to represent you or his fees may be too high

16

or he may have other commitments which conflict with the

court's schedule and make him unable to appear.

For example, the lawyer one would choose

He may not be

All these sorts of reasons can limit to some extent

21

the defendant's choice of counsel.

It is also limited by the

22

existence of certain serious conflicts of interest.

23

conflicts can be very many types.

24

wants may be a former prosecutor who, while he was working for

the Government, was involved in the same criminal matter or the

2

adverse to that defendant or he may be a fact witness at the

3

trial or implicated in the same criminal conduct with which the

4

defendant is charged.

5

Courts have universally held that under those

6

circumstances, the conflicts of interest override the

7

defendant's right to choose his counsel and permits

8

disqualification.

9

conflicts arises in cases where one lawyer represents more than

Now, the most common of these types of

10

one defendant in a given criminal case, and Rule 44(c) was

11

designed to deal with that situation.

12

States that -- the District Court has to inquire into

13

every instance of multiple representation, and take such

14

actions as may be appropriate unless there's good cause to

15

believe that no conflicts are likely to develop at trial.

16

The Rule 44(c) does not itself state what actions,

17

what measures might be appropriate if conflicts are likely to

18

arise, but the advisory committee note to the rule makes clear

19

that disqualification of counsel is legitimate option.

20

dangers created by multiple representation that Rule 44(c) is

21

designed to address is primarily centered around the fact as

22

noted during the previous argument that the interest of the two

23

defendants may diverge at trial.

24

— between the defendants may require the lawyer to forego

action that would help one of his clients at the expense of the

2

other.

3

Mr. Kellogg, let me throw out a question

4

that troubles me about the case to be sure you don't overlook

5

it.

6

You're mainly directing your remarks to the case in

7

which the new counsel would be the sole attorney for the

8

defendant, and I'm particularly concerned in this case about

9

the fact that this lawyer was willing to be additional counsel

10

and he could have kept the same counsel and this man just work

11

along with him.

12
13
14

Why wouldn't there be adequate protection against the
concerns you address if he let them both sit at counsel table?
MR. KELLOGG:

Well, first of all, from the record,

15

it's not actually clear whether Iredale was going to represent

16

him by himself or whether he was just --

17

QUESTION:

He originally wanted to do it by himself,

18

but it seemed to me that it was rather clear that he was

19

willing to serve as additional counsel and just cross examine

20

these witnesses that seemed so important to him, and I hope you

21

cover that point as fully as you can before you get through

22

because that's what troubles me about this case.

23
X

QUESTION:

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, it raises problems because he was

24

representing the other two defendants alone.

So, no other

25

counsel would be protecting their interests independently, and
24
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

with respect to his representation of Wheat, it would have

2

involved one of his clients being a principal — not a

3

principal witness, but certainly a witness with adverse

4

information to the Petitioner at the trial and it was also

5

particularly troubling about this case is the fact that he was

6

representing defendants at widely disparate levels of what was

7

a fairly large conspiracy.

9

representing a middle level defendant, Petitioner, who was

He was representing the lead
He was

10

responsible for brokering large amounts of marijuana, and one

11

of the small fish at the bottom who delivered.

12

QUESTION:

But I don't see why the other lawyer

13

wouldn't be perfectly able to look out for all the pitfalls

14

that would concern the Court in that situation.

15

the other lawyer is completely independent and competent, which

16

I gather he was from the record, he would surely, it would seem

17

to me, understand the potential for conflict and surely there

18

is some potential for conflict here.

19

MR. KELLOGG:

If you assume

Well, Rule 44(c) does say that the

20

primary burden is placed on the lawyer to anticipate conflicts

21

that are likely to develop, but there's a number of reasons why

22

they can't do that, and Rule 44(c) goes on to state that even

23

the defense counsel is not going to be able to anticipate all

24

the sorts of conflicts that might arise at trial because he's

25

not going to know fully what the nature of the Government's
25
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

case is.

2

Also, there's the problem that in representing more

3

than one defendant, it's difficult to give independent advice

4

to each defendant if the multiple representation favors one at

5

the expense of the other.

6

Now, with Petitioner having a separate counsel to

7

represent him, that concern would be alleviated somewhat, but

8

with the other two defendants not having separate counsel, that

9

concern — that's a very legitimate concern of the District

10

Court.

The fact that the motion to disqualify --

But the other lawyer —
He had not yet been sentenced.

MR. KELLOGG:

QUESTION:

Well, that would have been one option.

Why wouldn't that have been an adequate

10

option?

right to counsel of your choice, but surely there is some value

12

to letting a defendant have choice if all the other conditions

13

are met, that he's a lawyer and that he's competent and so

forth and so on.

15

is there not?

16

Because -- I know you say that there's no absolute

There is some value the Court should respect,

MR. KELLOGG:

really twofold.

Justice and Justice Scalia noted during Petitioner's argument,

19

with the problem of adequate waivers.

21

if he understands and appreciates all the dangers involved.

22

First, there's the concern as the Chief

QUESTION:

Each defendant has a

Now, that argument would support a rule

23

that will never respect a waiver because it may have litigation

24

about it later.

25

can't push that too far.

We just won't allow waivers.

I mean, you

There's got to be some situations in
27

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

which a defendant can waive conflicts, and there's always a

2

risk, you're absolutely right, there's always a risk in these

3

situations in post-conviction proceedings they'll say I didn't

4

know what I was doing just as you have in Faretta, but can that

5

be an adequate reason for never accepting a waiver?

6

MR. KELLOGG:

I think it could be.

Rule 44(c) could

7

be written to forbid all cases of multiple representation.

8

would serve significant interests of the criminal justice

9

system in the finality of judgments and the independent

11

Now, it's written, it doesn't go that far.

12

a lesser position to the effect that the trial judge must have

13

some discretion to override waivers in certain circumstances.

14

We're not suggesting a standard in which all cases of multiple

15

representation would lead to disqualification, but only when

16

there's a substantial likelihood of a serious conflict.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. KELLOGG:

It takes

What was that substantial likelihood here?
Substantial likelihood was created by,

19

first, as I mentioned, disparate positions of the defendants in

20

a criminal conspiracy. Gomez-Barajas was the lead defendant.

21

Petitioner was a lesser defendant.

22

defendant and the lesser defendant represented by the same

23

attorney in a criminal proceeding, there's always a danger that

24

the lead defendant will exercise too much influence upon the

25

decisions of the lesser defendant.

Whenever you have a lead

7

That's correct.

Well, decisions —

Decisions that the lawyer will take on behalf

QUESTION:

Well, in almost every criminal trial,

8

there is one dominant and one secondary character, and, so, you

9

would almost say that there is an absolute rule that the judge

10

is never required to accept a waiver when there are two

11

defendants, one of whom is dominant.

12

MR. KELLOGG:

If there is reason to think that there

13

is a hierarchial relationship between them, I would say that

14

the potential for conflict is sufficient that the District

15

Court would have discretion under those circumstances to

16

disqualify the joint representation.

17

I'd like to explain to you in a little more detail

18

the nature of the concerns here.

Even if the District Court

19

goes to great lengths to get a knowing and intelligent waiver,

20

it is still going to be subject to collateral attack on various

21

grounds.

22

foresee the actual conflicts that would develop or that he was

23

coerced by his co-defendant or that he was misled by

24

incompetent counsel, and there's a strong interest in the

25

finality of the judgments in preventing such collateral attack

The defendant can easily claim that he did not

Now, the

QUEST I ON:

Well, Mr. Cleary takes the position, the

10

rather clear position that waiver is always permitted, and

11

that, at first blush, sounds like a hard rule.

me that your position is that the judge can always decline the

13

request for joint counsel.

14

But it seems to

I can't imagine an instance in, say, a narcotic

trial, conspiracy, where the waivers would be allowed.

16

seems to me that your position is equally clear and hard-lined

17

on the other side.

18

MR. KELLOGG:

I think not.

So, it

If the evidence in a

19

particular case is roughly equal against two defendants, if

20

there doesn't seem to be any coercive relationship between

the appearance of impropriety in representing both the witness

curtailed to benefit the other in exchange for the cross

MR. KELLOGG:

Now, for example, Bravo pleaded guilty to criminal

15

conspiracy and acknowledged that he had participated in one

16

single overt act, one delivery of marijuana. He said that was

17

the extent of my involvement.

18

Now, if his involvement is, in fact, greater than

19

that, he's involved in more than one delivery and perhaps a

20

delivery with Petitioner, then what could be more convenient

21

than having the same counsel representing both, not cross

22

examining Bravo about other acts, and thereby not bringing out

23

any connection with the Petitioner.

QUESTION:

Pardon?

That would hurt the Government, not

4

bringing that out, but how would that hurt either of the

5

defendants?
MR. KELLOGG:

6

Well, I think there's an independent

7

interest here in the fairness and integrity of the criminal

8

justice system which would not be served by allowing such an

9

appearance of impropriety.

There's really two separate

10

interests here.

34

1

entered a guilty plea, and he was awaiting sentence.

2

There had been a negotiated plea agreement and the

3

District Court had indicated that he would be able to withdraw

4

his plea if the judge did not accept the sentencing

5

recommendation that had been made, but there had been a

6

sentencing recommendation made in his case.

QUESTION:

I think your substantial likelihood test

8

might be satisfied in the case in the sense that there would be

9

a substantial likelihood of the conflict, but the trial judge

10

could, nevertheless, take the waiver.

11

MR. KELLOGG:

12

QUESTION:

Well, certainly if the court --

I know you submit the trial judge would

13

have discretion not to take the waiver in that circumstance.

14

May he take the waiver?

15

MR. KELLOGG:

If there is a substantial likelihood of

16

a serious conflict of interest, the trial judge still has a

17

possibility of being able to cure that short of a waiver.

18

example, through a severance or some other action.

19

QUESTION:

question of a severance in this case?

QUESTION:

2

MR. KELLOGG:

3

Assuming he can do something to protect

against conflict.

4

QUESTION:

And is it also your position that where

5

there are joint trials, two people at the same trial or two

6

people who have been charged in the same charge but going to be

7

tried one after another, are you saying that there are

8

circumstances involving those facts that would not present a

9

substantial likelihood of conflict?

10

P

And —

MR. KELLOGG:

Yes.

There could be circumstances in

11

which a substantial likelihood of a conflict was not presented.

12

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

This is not it.

14

MR. KELLOGG:

But this is not it.

However, I would

15

stress that our principal interest in the standard fashion by

16

the court in this case, rather than the particular facts of

17

this case, the facts could be strong.

18

that we want to stress is that the two positions adopted by

19

Petitioner in his brief, the absolute position that waiver

20

cures everything, is unacceptable and contrary to the views of

21

the established disciplinary standards in every Court of

22

Appeals.

But the important point

23

The other standard that Petitioner puts forward in

24

his brief is to try to say that only when there is an actual

25

conflict of interest can disqualification be permitted, and we
36
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

would submit that that standard makes no sense in this context

2

because the decision has to be made prior to trial.
As the advisory committee notes, you can't anticipate

3
4

all the problems that are likely to develop in the course of a

5

trial, and if you wait for them to develop, then it's too late.

6

You have invited a mistrial in the case.
The important standard that we would suggest is that

7
8

the judge, trial judge finds a substantial likelihood of a

9

serious conflict of interest and he does have discretion to

10

disqualify counsel.
The final point that I would like to make is that

11
12

even if Petitioner could somehow show that the District Court

13

abused its discretion in this case because there wasn't a

14

serious likelihood of conflict of interest, he still has failed

15

to show any way in which he has been prejudiced by that

16

decision.

17

There's been no challenge here to the sufficiency of

18

the evidence or the fairness of the trial that he actually

19

received or the competence of his counsel.

20

the assistance of counsel, this Court has repeatedly stressed,

21

is recognized not for its own sake, but for the ability of the

22

accused to get a fair trial.
QUESTION:

23
24

Now, the right to

And tell me again why must prejudice be

shown.

MR. KELLOGG:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

QUESTION:

Tell me again why must prejudice be shown.

2

MR. KELLOGG:

It must be shown because of this

3

Court's statements in Strickland and Cronic as -- that the

4

purpose of the Sixth Amendment is served as long as Petitioner

5

received a fair trial at which he received the assistance of

6

competent counsel so as not to cast any doubt on the

7

reliability of the verdict.
If Petitioner is completely denied counsel, then the

8
9

Court has held that the rule of automatic reversal is

10

appropriate, but in a case where Petitioner receives the

11

assistance of counsel and there's no question that there's a

12

reliability of verdict, there's no reason to set that verdict

13

aside.
QUESTION:

14
15
16

How would one ever prove prejudice,

really?
MR. KELLOGG:

One would prove it by showing that the

17

trial one actually had was unfair within the meaning of

18

Strickland because the performance of one's counsel fell

19

measurably below the standards of the profession and undermines

20

the reliability of the verdict.

21

QUESTION:

Well, then, you get a new trial anyway.

22

MR. KELLOGG:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That really means there's no remedy

24

whatsoever for violating the right that's asserted here, if

25

there is such a right, because if you require that standard,
38

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

you — the judge — what the trial judge should always do is

2

disqualify counsel, and he -- as long as he's got somebody out

3

there who crosses the threshold of minimum effectiveness, he

4

cannot commit reversible error.

MR. KELLOGG:

That's true, but there's no reason to

think that the trial judge would not conscientiously -QUESTION:

There's a lot of trial judges I know who

don't like to be reversed.
MR. KELLOGG:

But in this respect, the right to

10

counsel of choice would not be really any different from, for

11

example, a District Court's decision on the severance motion or

12

a discovery motion, which is reviewable only in the context of

13

general review of a fair trial.

14

Unless the Court has any further questions.

As to Gomez-Barajas being the source, that is wrong.

5

The facts of this case indicate there were several enumerated

sources of marijuana, not Gomez-Barajas, and the reason he

7

wasn't was there was a prior acquittal and Vidal was still

8

shaking in his boots about the examination that he might have.

The question that Justice Stevens raised is

10

absolutely true, that there was almost on the knees begging

11

that this super-star defense lawyer be joined to the defense

MR. CLEARY:

I mean,
— I understand the Court's position and

that we're getting into certain imponderables, except that in

this case, he had the advantage of two separate defense

counsels.

neither one examined Bravo.

Not only for Mr. Wheat but also the co-defendant and

that he would be in a subordinate position to someone else who

MR. CLEARY:

If he was on the defense team and

I think the only one would be as to

15

Bravo, and I think it could be easily sanitized as an

16

alternative other than total disqualification to say that he

17

cannot examine Bravo, and in the context of this case, I think

18

that would have been reasonable.

19

The two other issues that I find every interesting is

tactical manipulation involved, and I think that there has to

society at least the concept of an ordered liberty, a

fundamental right of choice, the right to go with the one you

want.
