ORAL ARGUMENT BY ELLEN M. VIA.KLEY, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7
8

MS. VIA.KLEY :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :

9

This case arises under the Federal Tort Claims Act

10

which embodies Congress's broad waiver of governmental immunity

11

and consent to suit for the tortuous conduct of government

12

employees.

13

execution of Section 262(d) of the Public Health Service Act

14

and following regulations which govern the licensing and

15

release of live poliovirus vaccines.

16

The conduct complained of here is negligent

The issue presented involves the applicability of

17

Section 2680(a) of the Tort Claims Act which sets forth an

18

exception to the waiver of immunity to the conduct at issue.

19

The immunity preserved by 2680(a) is underpinned by

20

separation of powers principles.

It is intended to prevent the

21

judiciary, through the medium of an action in tort, from second

22

guessing the reasonableness of executive policy judgments.

23

This Court has consistently held that what is protected by

24

2680(a) is executive prerogative; decisionmaking grounded in

25

social, economic and political policy.

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

l

Congress used two clauses to accomplish its purpose

2

of 2680(a).

3

executes policy embodies that policy, is the policy made

4

manifest.

5

policy itself.

6

in execution of a statute or regulation provided due care is

7

exercise.

8
9

The first recognizes that conduct which obediently

A challenge to such conduct is an attack on the
The first clause, therefore, protects conduct

Now under the first clause, it does not matter
whether the conduct itself is discretionary or nondiscretionary

10

so long as it represents faithful execution of the regulatory

ll

plan.

12

The second clause in Section 2680(a) protects

lJ

discretionary conduct, the exercise of discretionary authority.

14

Now whether the conduct here warrants the protection of the

15

second clause, since it has forfeited any claim to immunity

16

under the first clause, requires e xaminat ion of the statute and

17

the regulations which give this agency its power to act.

18

The powers and duties of the agency with respect to

19

licensing biologic products, including live virus vaccines,

20

were defined by Congress in Section 262(d) of the Public Health

21

Service Act which directs that licenses may be issued only upon

22

a showing that the product meets regulatory standards.

23

statute provides no e xemptions to the requirements of

24

regulatory compliance, and it does not authorize the agency to

25

act according to its judgment of the best course in deciding

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The

l

whether compliance is necessary.

2

The agency's regulations reflect that statutory

J

mandate in providing that licenses may be issued only upon

4

examination of the product and upon demonstrated regulatory

5

compliance .

6
7

The regulatory standards particularly applicable to
live poliovirus vaccines are specifically charted in 42 CFR
73.110.

9
10

They cover three characteristics of the vaccines:

safety, potency and antigenicity, each of which is reduced to a
numerical value.

11

For example, under 73.115, the data must demonstrate

12

that the concentration of live virus particles in the vaccine

13

is between 200,000 and 500,000 TCID per dose.

14

Under 73.117, antigenicity, there are specific pre-

15

and post-treatment ratios of type-specific antibodies that must

16

be demonstrated before the vaccine is in compliance with that

17

standard.

18

QUESTION:

19

it clearly in mind?

20

May I interrupt just to be sure I have got

One of the regulations I know says that the strain

21

must be free of harmful effect, and then I know there is more

22

particularity.

23

would you agree that was a discretionary judgment?

24
25

But if it just said free of harmful effect,

MS. VIAKLEY:

No, I would not, because we have

alleged that the strain in fact paralyzed people in the test

5
Heritage Reporting Corporat ion

That does raise one point, though, because there is

2

some contention in the briefs about exactly what is licensed
under this statute:

4

Is it the strain, is it a seed virus, is

it a vaccine.

5

Now the government has contended, and we are willing

6

to accept for present purposes, that the license is issued for

7

the poliovirus vaccine.

8

Sabin, live poliovirus vaccine.

In this instance, it was the Type III

19

comply with the required numbers?

20

MS. VIA.KLEY:

QUESTION:

22
21

24

That's correct, Your Honor.

It's a little hard for me to follow parts

of your -- o f the way you presented it in the brief.
MS. VIAKLEY:

The regulations are a little

convo luted.
QUESTION:

See, the regulations -- when I look at the

7
Heritage Reporting Corpo ration
(202) 628-4888

1

actual regulations, they seem to use words like "free of

2

harmful effect" and so forth, which suggests to me a

3

discretionary judgment.

MS. VIAKLEY:

Your Honor, free of harmful effect

5

appears in the first part of 73.110 which talks about the

6

original virus strain.

17

18

Right.
According to

Isn't that what we're talking about?

MS. VIAKLEY :

According to the government, we're

talking about the vaccine monopools themselves.
QUESTION:

Well, you're the Petitioner, and I thought

you were complaining about the original Sabin strain.
MS. VIAKLEY :

We are, Your Honor.

As I was trying to

explain to Justice Stevens
QUESTION:

And on that is it necessary that the

agency determine that it's without harmful effect?
MS. VIAKLEY:

What is necessary is for the agency to

19

review the five original monopools that were produced from that

20

parent strain and assess them for compliance with the

21

neurovirulence criteria.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. VIAKLEY:

24
25

Well, that's later on.
No, that's set out in 73,110, the

section that applies even in the original virus strain.
Now when a license is issued for that vaccine that's

8
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

l

represented by those monopools, what that amounts to is an

2

approval for the continued use of the parent strain.
QUESTION:

3

Well, can't the agency say that something

4

is without harmful effect even though it causes let's say one

5

case of polio in a hundred thousand?

6

MS. VIAKLEY:

The critical allegation here, Your

7

Honor, is that the qualifying monopools exceeded quantitative

n

standards in the regulations, in 73.114.

That's the critical

allegation with regard to the original licensing decision.
QUESTION :

10

Ms.

Viakley, where in your petition for

ll

certiorari do we find

12

on Page 4l(a) of your petition.

13

there.

14

Where do we find them either in your brief or in your petition?

15

16

I know that Section 262 is set forth
Section 601.20 is set forth

But you have referred to several other regulations.

MS. VIAKLEY:

In the brief, Your Honor, they are

reprinted in the appendix.

17

QUESTION:

In the appendix to the brief?

18

MS. VIAKLEY:

19

the text of the brief.

Yes.

They are referred to throughout

20

QUESTION:

Thank you.

21

QUESTION:

I take it your position is that if they

22

didn't qualify under those specific standards, there was a

23

nondiscretionary duty just not to license.

24

MS. VIAKLEY :

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

As Judge Higginbotham said.

9
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MS. VIA.KLEY:
2

That's correct, and that arises both

from the statute and the regulations.
Again, if you take a look at 73.114, which is the
critical standard here, it's the critical one that was violated

5

when the original license was issued.
QUESTION:

You said there isn't any room anywhere for

7

somebody who knows that the batch or lot doesn't comply with

R

those specific standards, there is no room to nevertheless go
ahead with it.

lCI

MS. VIAKLEY:

None.

There is no authority provided

ll

either by the statute or the regulations to license despite

12

noncompliance.

IJ

QUESTION:

Well, what's your theory about how it did

14

happen then?

Do you think there was just pure sheer

15

negligence, or that --

16

MS. VIA.KLEY:

There may have been pure sheer

17

negligence, or ln the Griffin case what happened, and the proof

10

that was recounted in the district court's opinion, was that

I?

agency employees decided that the neurovirulence criteria

20

weren't really as strict as the regulations made them seem, and

21

an agency employee decided to ascribe the difference to

22

something called biological variation.

23
74

25

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the agency say there is some

kind of discretion here?
MS. VIA.KLEY :

No, not in these regulations.

10
Heritage Reporting Corporati on
(202) 628-4888

They

l

pointed to nothing in the regulations that confers policy

2

judgment to license.
QUESTION:

What's their theory for aff1rmance?

MS. VIAKLEY :

Their theory for affirmance is

'>

basically asking this Court to provide what Congress did not --

r,

a broad per se exception for regulatory conduct.

7

argument made in the brief that would entitle this Court to

There is no

conclude that the specific conduct at issue here is

?

d1scretionary.
QUESTION:

10

They don't claim that there was any room

11

for discretion either.

12

MS. VIAKLEY:

13

this conduct is discretionary, no exercise of policy judgment.
QUESTION:

14
15

They have identified no argument that

So whether this was a deliberate ignoring

of the -- whether this was a deliberate act, or a negligent
act, they say it makes no difference.
MS. VIAKLEY:

l7

Makes no difference, because there is

18

no authority to exerc1se policy judgment in making this

19

decision.

20

QUESTION:

Now the first thing that happens is that

21

the strain is licensed; is that correct?

72

c hronologically the first thing that happens ?

23
24
25

MS. VIA.KLEY:

Is that

2

or1ginal monopools.
QUESTION:

That

That's the first thing that happens.
And there must be a determination under

73.114 that the characte rist1cs had been met?

r,

MS. VIAJ<LEY:

That the characteristics of all five

7

consecutive monopools comply with the criteria set out ln

fl

73.114.

QUESTION:

q

lO

I thought the monopools didn't come until

after the strain had been first manufactured.
MS. VIAJ<LEY:

ll

No, in 73.110, the second that refers

to the stra1n, you see that the p r ocess goes all the way down
IJ

to the monopool level.
QUESTION:

14

No, I'm talking about just licensing,

manufacture of the strain, does 73.114 apply before that

1r,

license can be granted?
MS. VIAJ<LEY:

17

73.110.

Yes, it does, and that's clear in

The regulation itself refers specifically to the

criteria of 73.114, and says that five consecutive original

2I

22
;> 3

qualifying monopools must meet those criteria.
QUESTION:

was there a separate license granted for

the seed virus?
MS. VIAJ<LEY:

Well, Your Honor, our understanding,

i4

based on documents reviewed from some of the state court

25

litigation, was that there was government approval of the seed

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

l

virus which we interpreted to mean issuance of a license.

The

l

govPrnment has contended in its brief that a formal license is

J

not issued, but admits that government approval is required.
Now the record does not demonstrate the nature of
that approval.

h

7

QUESTION:

What agency action with respect to the

seed virus are you complaining about?
MS. VIAKLEY:

9

we are complaining about the initial

approval of the seed virus, because we have alleged that the

10

particular seed virus that produced the vaccine that paralyzed

ll

this child also demonstrated excessive neurovirulence.
QUESTION:

Now according to the Third Circuit, I

lJ

believe, your claim relating to the approval of the seed virus,

14

and you r claim rel ating to release of the lot of vaccine were

15

the same issue.
MS. VIAKLEY:

17

Well, Your Honor, the Third Circuit

didn't distinguish among any of the claims.

It made no

distinction between the licensing lot release, made no
19

distinctions at all among --

20

QUESTION:

21

But the regulations make that distinction,

don't they?

22

MS. VIAKLEY:

7.J

QUESTION:

21
2'>

Yes, they do , Your Honor.

Is the seed virus approved in some way

other than by approval of the lot of vaccine?
MS. VIAJ<LEY:

Your Honor, that is not clear from the

13
Heritage Reporting Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

record presented.

2

11cens1ng decision.

3

We have alleged that it is tantamount to

As we indicated in the reply brief, given the

4

contentions raised by the government, I think that is an issue

5

on which it might be appropriate to remand for factual

fi

consideration and factual development of, number one, what the

7

nature of the government approval was; and, number two, whether

8

or not the recertification requirement of the regs was a

Q

mandatory directive.

10

And we have indicated those facts we think would be

11

appropriate for development on that issue in the reply brief.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

May I go back for a moment to 73.114(bJ,

your position on that?
Are you alleg1ng that the tests were not valid in the

IJ

sense that the samples weren't sufficient as they describe, or

16

that val1d tests were cond ucted but they produced results which

17

failed the standard in the regulation?

18

MS. VIAKLEY:

we're saying that the numbers on the

19

license application reviewed by the DBS employee demonstrated

20

excess1ve neurovirulence; that the numbers on the form were

21

h1gher than the numbers in the NIH reference.

QUESTION:

No.

But, rather, that valid tests were

conducted which produced numbers that violated a standard that
is somewhere in this regulation -- I've had difficulty finding,

J

frankly.

So that in other words when it talks about

2J

a comparative evaluation toward the end, that's a evaluat1on to

24

be made by the manufacturer making the test, isn't it?

25

MS. VIAKLEY:

The manufacturer generates this data,

puts it on a 11cense form, and the DBS employee has to review
the numbers to see that they match or do not exceed the NIH

here.
QUESTION:

Well, how can you tell from (1i1), the

QUESTION:

That's the process.

These NIH reference numbers that we don't

have, and I understand you say we don't need them, that at this

13

stage we accept the allegation that they were clear numbers

that were clearly different from what happened here, they are

That's correct.

No, no, no.

The reference numbers.

The reference numbers are the same as

those we 're talking about here.
QUESTION:

No, no, but I assume the reference numbers

24

are numbers that NIH develops using its judgment as to how high

25

the numbers have to be before the product is dangerous, no?

19
Heritage Reporting Corporation

No, the NIH tests a reference strain,

Okay, now, you think that there would be

one judgment Ln this case if NIH left Lt to a partLcular

2J

scientist or teams o f scientists to both pick the strain and

therefore develop the NIH number, and then apply that to the

whether there is lLability on the part of the United States.

R

That makes the difference as to

MS. VIA.KLEY :

Your Honor, that's the argument

I'm not taking it all the way up to

MS. VIA.KLEY :

You're taking it back up the stream

though.

The question here is not where does discretion begin.
The question is where in that stream of activity does

2

stop; is the particular conduct at issue conduct which involves

of judgment or embodies policy judgment by

faithful execution of it.
If not, if it simply represents negligent execution

of nondiscretionary directives, that's exactly the conduct that

and that's what we have here.

MS. VIAKLEY:

QUESTION:

MS. VIAKLEY:

That's correct.

Is that mandatory or discretionary?
Well, again, Your Honor, in our reply

18

regulation on its face is not mandatory.

l '.J

lnd1cated ln the reply brief lS that facts of record in other

appl1ed to live poliov1rus vaccines, that directive 1s

mandatory.

The

What we have

But more significantly on that issue, I think,

is

24

what happened after the dec1sion to test was made.

25

even if that decision was discretionary, discretion ended there

22
Her1tage Report1ng Corporation

because the decision subsequent to that to release the vaccine

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

9

MR. KELLOGG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

I think it may be helpful, given the questions during

11

counsel's argument, to go through exactly what the regulations

12

require in this instance, and focus on the specific allegations

13

made by Petitioners.

14

The first thing that's done is that a product license

15

is issued for a vaccine product.

16

use a particular strain of poliovirus.

17

regulations, the strain of poliovirus must have been tested on

18

100,000 susceptible people and shown to be without harmful

19

effects.

20

Now that vaccine product will
And according to the

Now one of Petitioners• allegations appears to be

21

that the strain of poliovirus at issue here was tested and

22

found to have been with harmful effects.

23

be, as Justice Stevens pointed out, that the phrase "without

24

harmful effect " embraces considerable policy judgment.

25

Our positio n would

In fac t, as we pointed out in our brief, that the

24

lSSue ln th1s case was considered by a panel of sc1entific

experts over a t..,o - year period before finally -QUESTION:

Yes, but the problem, and r th1nk Justice

Scalia put h is finger o n it and I want to be sure you address
it.
"

Suppos1ng we all agree that that's a discretionary

standard

w1thout harmful effect".
But supposingly they then further particularize

1l

certain standards that are reducible to numerical values that

'.I

would be a regulation saying if it crosses the line, it shall

10

bP deemed to have harmful effects and shall not be licensed.

II

And assume that in a very liberal reading of the

12

complaint they have said that the test results, when delivered

IJ

to the agency, showed that they violated the particularized

14

standard, but somebody failed to read the thing, or said, I

l

Even if he knew .

Even though there was no discretion in

that particular employee?
MR. KELLOGG:

l

Even though that employee had a

specific mandate as to what his duty was to be, because the

r,

wording of the discretionary function e xception focuses on

7

functions of the agencies, not just on duties of particular

n
The inquiry were under a qualified immunity case in

'l

Ill

which the individual employee were being sued, it might well be

11

appropriate to look at his specific mandate to determine

whether he violated that mandate with a view to whether he

personally should be liable in tort.
QUESTION:

Taking it a step furt her.

You would say

then that eve n if the regulations required t he tests to be

He's going out to perform

lJ

the inspection and od the job the regulatory agency has asked

16

him to do.

17

MR. KELLOGG:

That's true, but it is clear from the

lij

legislative history that Congress intended to draw a

19

distinction between the common law torts of the employee's

20

regulatory agencies and the peculiar regulatory activities of

21

inspecting, licensing and certifying.

22

And ordinary car accident on the way to perform an

the peculiar regulatory functions at the agency.

It would not impact upon

28
Heritage Reporting Corporation
( 202) 628-4888

l

QUESTION:

Congress embodied all of that in the

2

phrase "discretionary function · , and also embodied the

1

distinction that you urged upon us between -- you say it would

4

make a difference whether the government here was displacing

5

the manufacturer in the testing or not.

6

Congress chose to express that by the term ··discretionary

7

function".

8
9

MR. KELLOGG:

And all of that

I think that's right, Justice Scalia.

The court in Varig said quite clearly that the original

10

purpose, the original proposals for the discretionary function

11

exception were to name certain specific agencies by name, like

12

the Federal Trade Commission, or the SEC, and exempt them

13

completely.

14

Congress decided not to do that because as the court

15

in Varig said, the langauge of the discretionary function

16

exception would "exempt from the acts claims against federal

17

agencies growing out of their regulatory activities. ·
QUESTION :

LS

Why would it make any difference whether

19

you were displacing the manufacturer's testing or not, whether

20

you are doing the testing yourself or displacing the

21

manufacturer's testing?

22

How could that possibly made a difference as to the

23

degree to which it's a discretionary function of the federal

24

agency?

25

MR. KELLOGG :

It makes a difference in several

29

Heritage Reporting Corporation

,

respects.

One of the primary purposes of the act was to

compensate people who would otherwise go uncompensated.

l

In the case where you have a primary actor in the
regulatory context, the injured party can look first, as

5

Petitioners did in this case, to the primary actor.
QUESTION:

It makes a lot of sense to me, but I asked

7

why does it have anything to do with whether it's a

8

discretionary function or not.

You're telling me why it would

isn't.

13

MR. KELLOGG:

I'm asking why that in one

l4

sense that -- well, take the specific statute and regulations

at issue here.

They require the agency to license drugs and

make a determination of whether the drugs are safe.

They do

17

not specify in any sense what the standards are to be applied

IA

by the agency or --

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kellogg, that's not quite fair,

because your opponents refers us to Section 73.114, tests for
21

safety and the neurovirulence standards, and says they are very

22

specific and require numerical calculations that can easily be

21

determined mechanically, and that the complaint alleges a

24

failure to meet the standards, the mechanical standards.

I don't think that follows at all.

QUESTION:

But the exemption here is not for

negli9ence; it's for discretion.
MR. KELLOGG:

Well, what the court made clear in

11

wrongful acts.

So the mere fact that we have negligence or a

wrongful act in permitting the lot to be released does not take

this c ase out of the discretion.

MR. KELLOGG:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

That's correct .

But you have got to show that it was not

only negligent, but that it was discretionary.
MR. KELLOGG:

But the language of the exception is

The regulations in

here do not bind the agency in any respect.

understand it, the agency must make this determinatio n and at

some later point they can c all in particular lots.

l1r. Kellogg, can I ask about a possible

narrower basis to get where you want to go?
Does all of th1s case turn upon the obligation that a

MR. KELLOGG:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now that determination, we have some of

the standards reproduced here.

Are there any other s tandards

that do involve a bit of discretion?
I mean these standards that I see here don't.

r

17

mean, if it's just, you know, the number of lesions, length of

18

lesions, things 11ke that, that's no discretion.

l?

Are there any other standards that have to be

determ1ned, compliance w1th which has to be determ1ned by the

agency that do involve some discretion?

22

MR. KELLOGG:

well, certai nly the standard I was

noting to Justice Stevens earlier about the strain of

from harmful effect, and we would say that that involves

QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

May I ask you a factual question?

Do you need a separate product license for a seed
virus?

12

MR. KELLOGG :

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KELLOGG:

No.

You don't.
No.

The seed virus, in fact the seed

15

virus in question here, which Petitioners are referring to, was

16

first begun to be used by Lederle three years after the product

17

was originally licensed.

18

QUESTION:

I might agree with you, Mr. Kellogg, this

19

far, that if an agency has a determination to make that

20

involves some elements that require a l ot of judgment, but also

21

five elements that are either they are or they aren't, and they

22

are quite clear, I would still call that probably a

23

discretiona ry judgment.

24

But you really haven't given me very many examples of
any discretion in this at all.

39
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, with respect to the seed virus,

2

for e xample, all the requirements apply to the manufacturer.

J

The regulations are quite explicit that the manufacturer must

4

perform certain tests and determine that they comply.

5

don't impose any duties at all on the government.
The same applies to the lot release questions.

that some of those tests were not done.

19
20
21

And before any lot of

And Peti t ioners are claiming

The regulations put the burden of compliance in that
respect on the manufacturer, not on the government.
No w the Court of Appeals in this case adopted a

22

position that is really very close to what we were arguing.

23

They ostensibly rejected the broader proposition that all

24

regulatory activities are protected from suit, but they

25

nonetheless stressed that in undertaking the discretionary

40
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

function except1on you do not isolate one regulation and look
for whether that particular regulation has in it mandatory
langauge or not.

You look to the regulations as a whole to

rletermine whether the ultimate burden of compliance is on the
5

manufacturer or on the government.

r.

The court said that in this case after looking

7

through the regulat1ons, and I am quoting here from Page 20 - A

ll

of the Petitioners' appendix, "The FDA made a policy choice to

1

leave compliance in the first instance with the manufacturer."

llJ
II

That seems to be the crucial point in this case.
That is the manufacturer who has the primary duty of
responsibility for compliance.
QUESTION:

lJ

And in no event shall a lot be released

unless so and so.
MR. KELLOGG:
ii;

The regulations do not say that in

fact.

No, it's awfully close.

QUESTION:

They do not purport to limit in any sense

I thought you conceded that if they file

this piece of paper, this lot 11ke they were supposed to, and

2J

there was no examination whatsoever, there would be liability.

24

MR. KELLOGG:

The lot release regulations, Justice

White, they are printed in the last page of Petitioners' brief,

I

610.2(d).
QUESTION:

SA- 10?

MR. KELLOGG:

SA-10, that's correct.

It says specifically that upon notification by the
5

director of the Bureau of Biologic, a manufacturer shall not
distribute a lot of product until the lot is released by the

7

director.
QUESTION :

H

Right.

MR. KELLOGG:

But it does not limit in any sense the

10

discretion of the director as to whether or not he is going to

11

issue such a notification, as to whethe r or not he is going to

12

require that that approval in any specific instance.
QUESTION:

I I

Well, how does this thing work in

14

practice?

The manufacturer gets these lots ready for release.

15

And can he just decide I've passed the test, so I am going to
release them, or does he have to come to the FDA or whatever it

17

is and say, okay, I'm about to release these?
MR. KELLOGG:

19
20

As a practical matter in the area of

the oral poliovirus vaccine, the FDA requires them to bring
lot to them, and the FDA is quite thorough in rechecking

21

test results, and even performing some of the tests itself to

22

double chec k the manufacture.

2J

QUESTION:

And then it determi nes whether the

)4

manufacturer has adequately performed the tests, or whether the

25

stuff complies with the regulations, or what?

42
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. KELLOGG:
Z

J

That's correct, that's correct.

Our central contention would be that there is not a
sliding scale in this area so that when one agency elects to
spot check compliance, another agency elects to check
compliance thoroughly, and a third elects actually to redo test

6

results itself.

7

potent1al exposure to liability on the part of the government.

A
0

Yet the greater the oversight, the more

There are a couple of reasons why that would be a
very unfortunate result.

It would on the one hand reduce the

10

manufacturer's own incentive to be safe if part of the burden

11

for compliance can be pushed off to the government.

12

For example, Lederle Laboratories filed an amicus

ll

brief in this case saying this is a joint responsibil ity as to

14

whether a product complies.

15

do not want manufacturers to be able to take.

16

primary responsibility to comply in each instance with the

17

regulatory requirements.

18

by the government should not take away any of their primacy

19

responsibility.

20

That's precisely the attitude we
It is their

And the extent of oversight exercised

Furthermore, there should not be a disincentive

2L

created to the government as to the extent of oversight its

22

going to conduct, because the government clearly has a

21

discretionary choice here as to the extent of monitoring

24

compliance with the regulations.

25

And if the greater the monitoring undertaken by the

43
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

government, the more the poten t ial tort liability.

That's a

d1sincentive for the government to engage in extensive
oversight.

So, in Pffect, you have a double underlining of the

4

ent1re purpose of a regulatory program which is to require the

5

manufaeturer to comply with the regulatory requirements.
QUESTION:

That is not true though -- what you say is

really, it seems to me, relevant to the lot release by the
8

manufacturer, but not to the issuance of the i nit1al license,

?

because there must be a test before the license can be issued,

10
l1

and there must be an examination by the government.
MR. KELLOGG :

Well, there must be tests performed by

l'

the manufacturer.

IJ

the tests that the manufacturer --

14

15
I fj

The regulations are quite specific as to al

QUESTION:

And those tests must be reviewed by the

government.
MR. KELLOGG:

They must be submitted to the

11

government, and there has to be some sort of examination of

18

compliance.

l?

With respect to the licensing cla im , the specific

20

provision that the age ncy claims we violated has to do with

21

whether the strain involved was tested on 100,000 people and

22

shown to be w1thout harmful effect.

2J
24

we would contend that that determination by the
agency i nvolves co nsiderable policy judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Petitioner says that

44
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

l

the original license has to meet -- the strain has to meet the
test for safety in 73.114 .
MR. KELLOGG:

Not the strain itself, Just1ce

O'Connor, but particular lots of vaccines have to be produced
5

and meet the requirements.
QUESTION:

7
B

MR. KELLOGG:

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, they are not really so specific.

There 1s a number of comparative factors.

I 1

14

And they say that those tests are very

specific in terms of the numerical comparisons.

l l

12

Before the initial license can be

obtained, that's correct .
QUESTION:

10

Before the initial license can be granted.

QUESTION:

But we take the complaint as 1t's drafted,

don't we?

15

MR. KELLOGG:

We do as far as the factual

tri

allegations, but not as far as what the regulations state and

17

require.

18

regulations in issue here.

19

That we determine by reading the particular

QUESTION:

Well, SEction 262 says that the license

20

has to meet standards prescribed in regulations showing they

21

meet such standards, and they say that 114 is the regulation.

22

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correc t, Justice O'Connor, but

21

the statute does not specify in any sense what the nature of

24

the tests are going to be, how specif 1c they have to be, or how

25

specific the overview or review has to be by the agency.

45

Heritage Report1ng Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The statute at issue in Varig Airlines was fairly
2

ic too.

That set out in the opinion of the Court of

J

Appeals, and it says with respect - - at Page 19 - A of the

4

appendix to the petition.

5

certification can only be issued.

It says that a production
The Sec r eta ry of

Transportatio n shall make such inspection , and may require such
7

tests as may be necessary to ensure manufacture of each unit in

8

conformity with the type of certificate for which the airplane

q

has been issued.

10

And the court made it clear that that gave the agency

11

considerable discretion to decide -- to institute a spot

12

chPCking program in which it would place the burden on the

13

manufacturer to perform the initial test and do a lot of the

14

checking.
QUESTION :

The two statutes may look alike, but when

you get down to the regulations, the FDA performed a lot
17

differently than the FAA in Varig.
MR. KELLOGG:

18

19

The FDA engages in subs t antially more

oversight tha n the FAA did in Varig Airlines, that is correct.

20

Our position would be that that in itself does not

21

make the disc r etionary function exception not apply.

That

22

certainly increa ses the opportunities for neglige nce , or for

23

wrongful acts.

applies whether or not the discretion has been abused in that

way.
