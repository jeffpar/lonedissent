CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument

now in No. 87-626, Michael Sheridan against the United States.
We will wait just a moment, Mr. Kator, until the
Court clears.
(Pause.)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Very well, Mr. Kator.

You may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. KATOR, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KATOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

13

it please the Court, this statutory construction case

14

presents the question of whether Congress intended that the

IS

intentional tort exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act

16

would preclude all suits from which the government

17

negligently failed to prevent an employee from committing an

18

intentional tort.

19

The court below held that this is in fact what

20

Congress intended.

21

construction that would, for example, absolve the government

22

of its negligence in allowing a child at a federally run day

23

care center to be molested if the assailant happened to be a

24

federal employee, or indeed if the victim couldn't prove that

25

the assailant was other than a federal employee.

Thus the Court below sanctioned a

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

3

2

This construction would also absolve the government
of liability for injuries resulting from a weapon possessed

3

in contravention of a federal hospital's regulations if

4

the injuries happened to be intentionally inflicted and if

5

the assailant happened to be a federal employee.

6

struction cannot be correct.

7

intended the government's liability to

8

fortuitous circumstances.

9

create the fine spun and capricious distinctions which this

10

construction requires.

11

QUESTION:

This con­

Congress could not have
hinge on such

It could not have intended to

Would that necessarily follow?

I mean,

12

in the day care center cases couldn't you say that the dis­

13

tinction turns on whether the obligation to the plaintiff

14

arises from the government's status as an employer, or

15

rather arises from the government's status as the runner of

16

the center?

17

one category and the employment cases into another?

18

Wouldn't that be enough to throw one case into

MR. KATOR:

Certainly, Your Honor.

That is

19

essentially the position that the dissent in the Court of

20

Appeals took.

21

seems to endorse.

22

controls the applicability of the intentional tort exception.

23

It is also a position that the government
That is that the source of the duty

In the day care center case, the government owes

24

its duty to the children at the day care center, not because

25

it may or may not employ the assailant, but because it has
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4

1

chosen to run a day care center, and if indeed they do

2

assume this task voluntarily, then it is hornbook law that

3

they must use due diligence in performing that duty, so yes,

4

certainly you can more narrowly define it and say, yes, the

5

source of the duty determines the applicability of Section

6

2680(h).

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KATOR:

You don't disagree with that?
Not at all.

That was our principal

9

argument in the Court of Appeals.

10

of two says.

11

did in the day care center case, where we have children and

12

we will watch out for you, or they can arise indirectly, as

13

they do in a case of, for example, the instances the

14

government cites, where we have to control a mental patient

15

who is dangerous.

16

that mental patient may come across and injure, so it owes

17

that duty indirectly, but either way it owes the duty to the

18

victim, and that —

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Duties can arise in one

They can arise directly to the victim, as they

The government owes that duty to whomever

You are talking about a duty imposed

by state law now.
MR. KATOR:

Absolutely, Your Honor, not a duty

22

which grows out of the employment, out of the fact of

23

employment of the assailant, but simply a duty imposed by

24

state law, or, as in the day care center case, or in our

25

case, by the promulgation of regulations, a duty which the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

1

2

government imposed upon itself.
QUESTION:

You suggest the promulgation of

3

regulations by the government gives rise to a source of duty

4

independent of state law.

5

can win this case and still not be correct on that point. It

6

may be that the law of Maryland would say that government

7

regulations make someone negligent per se for violating them.

8

I don't know if the Federal Tort Claims Act itself creates

9

a — imposes a duty by virtue of government regulations.

10

MR. KATOR:

Even if you -- it seems to me you

The Federal Tort Claims Act would

11

impose duty -- would impose liability on the United States

12

if there would be liability in Maryland.

13

the doctrine of per se negligence and holds that if regula­

14

tions or statutes are adopted for the protection of person

15

and property and they are violated, then that can give rise

16

to an action for negligence, negligence per se.

17

Maryland does follow

But you're quite right in saying that the Federal

18

Tort Claims Act does not necessarily create the negligence

19

per se claim.

20

We did principally argue in the court below that

21

it was the source of the duty that controlled, but we also

22

argue here, as the Ninth Circuit has held, that indeed the

23

statutory language is broader than has been attributed to it

24

by, for example, this Court in Shearer.

25

The Ninth Circuit held that Congress intended to
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

6

1

distinguish between intentional torts and negligent acts.

2

Intentional acts were excluded from coverage and negligent

3

ones were included, and that is the distinction that the

4

Ninth Circuit held, allowing claims for what are character­

5

ized as negligent supervision to go forward, while saying,

6

no, you may not hold the government responsible under the

7

theory of respondeat superior for the intentional torts of

8

its agents.

9

QUESTION:

If the Ninth Circuit is completely

10

right, then you really wouldn't be giving full meaning, it

11

seems to me, to 2680(h).

12

that the waiver of governmental tort immunity doesn't apply

13

as it is set forth there.
MR. KATOR:

14

You wouldn't need the provision

There would be a distinction between

15

the -- if I understand your comment, you are suggesting that

16

2680:(h) is somehow broader than simply for assault.
QUESTION:

17

Well, as I understand it, it's an

18

exception to the liability imposed by the Federal Tort Claims

19

Act.

20

MR. KATOR:

21

QUESTION:

22

Which makes the government ordinarily

liable for negligence.

23

MR. KATOR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

Yes.
And so if there wouldn't be liability

for negligence in the first place in this situation, you
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

wouldn't need 2680(h).

2

MR. KATOR:

I see.

Well, Your Honor, I think

3

again what you have to do in that respect is go back into

4

the historical perspective and see what Congress was con­

5

sidering when it was enacting this particular provision.

6

what it was looking at was the fact that, A, there was a

7

distinction between negligent supervision and intentional

8

torts, and B, many commentators, some states, were expanding

9

the doctrine of respondeat superior to reach intentional

10

torts simply as a matter of social policy.

11

ment cites and we cite to legislative history where the

12

committee is stating, let's take it step by step.

13

proceed cautiously.

14

liability for intentional torts until considerable

15

experience is had under the Act, and we submit that what

16

Congress was talking about there was wanting to forestall

17

the inclusion of respondeat superior for intentional torts

18

of government agents, and that is all they were talking

19

about.

20

And

And the govern­

Let's

Let's forestall adoption of the

That is why Congress saw it was necessary to

21

say that, because some states do allow it.

22

didn't have the benefit, obviously, of this Court's

23

decision in Laird versus Nelms.

24

these -- this conduct, wrongful conduct may have been

25

attributed to the United States.

It may have assumed that

So that, I submit, is what Congress was after in
adopting that language.
We have spoken briefly about the source of duty,

4

and we have briefed that fully.

5

like to make about that is that it, unlike any of the

6

analyses the government has put forward, is consistent with

7

underlying tort law, which'the Federal Tort Claims Act was

8

modeled after, and it doesn't have the internal consistencies,

9

it doesn't have all the exceptions popping up that we have

10

to nagivate our way around.

11

of the scope of the duty argument.

12

The only other point I'd

That is the central advantage

The final point I would like to make would be just

13

to address myself briefly to the government's argument, which

14

is that the intentional tort exception doesn't apply when

15

an excluded action is an essential element of the claim.

16

That argument is inconsistent with -- first of all, it's

17

inconsistent with Panella, which says that federal

18

employees -- non-federal employees who commit intentional

19

torts, that is not outside the scope.

20

as essential to a claim as would be the claim of a federal

21

employee having committed that identical assault.

22

Those acts are just

It is also inconsistent with the source of the duty

23

argument which the government endorses.

There is no reason

24

to say that this failing to control a prisoner or mental

25

patient and allowing him to commit assault is not an

3

I think is also important here is that the government

is essential, an essential element, and frankly, we don't

QUESTION: You would have a suit against the
hospital but not against -MR. KATOR:

Exactly, and if you have a suit against

5

the hospital, the primary motivation of the Federal Tort

6

Claims Act, as made clear in the statutory language, was

7

to hold the United States liable in situations where it would

8

be liable if it were a private citizen, so that is something

9

that the government conceded in the court below, that indeed

10

all the facts being the same here, if this were a private

11

individual instead of the government, there would be

12

liability, and that's crucial.

13

QUESTION:

But that isn't -- that isn't the

14

object of the Act, to the extent it has that exception.

15

mean, a private individual would be held for claims arising

16

MR. KATOR:

What I submit that (h) intended to do,

21

Your Honor, again was to say, you may have respondeat

22

superior liability for intentional torts in this state.

23

You will not have it against the United States.

incursion of liability onto the United States.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We are

11

1

That's what we submit.

2

QUESTION:

So you think the only effect of that

3

language is that in all government employment situations

4

the claim for assault by a government employee will now not

5

be based on respondeat superior but a claim of negligent

6

failure to supervise?

7

MR. KATOR:

8

QUESTION:

If such —
You can bring all of those things

9

whenever there's a government employee, so long as you

10

allege negligent failure to supervise?

11

MR. KATOR:

We made two arguments.

12

argument, that the statute is that broad, yes, that would

13

be a viable claim.

14

negligent in failing to prevent this, and if you could prove

15

it, if you could prove that the government was negligent,

16

then there's no reason to suggest that Congress intended to

17

withhold liability in that situation.

18

QUESTION:

You could say the government was

Except when they use the term "arising

19

out of assault," you are giving it a very, very narrow

20

meaning.

Certainly your client's claim arises out of

21

assault.

There is not the slightest doubt about that.

22

MR. KATOR:

Your Honor, that's correct.

It

23

arises out of assault, and if it were not for the fact that

24

it also arose out of antecedent negligence, then you could

25

say that it arose only out of assault, but -Heritage Reporting Corporation

3

The statute doesn't say, "arising only

It says, "arises out of assault."

MR. KATOR:

What the statute says is, "arising out

4

of assault," and what arising means, if you look in the

5

dictionary, which is the first place we must look when we are

6

construing these statutes, arising means originate or

government's negligence.

9

This claim, this injury, even, originated in the
That was the first step.

So if you're going to look at arising out of and

10

focus very narrowly on exactly what the words say, then we

11

submit it must go to the genesis of the claim, not to the

12

immediate act which preceded the injury.

13

see that our reading of "arising out of" is in any way incon­

sistent with Congress's intent or artificial in any sense.

MR. WRIGHT:

language of the statute, where we recently ended.

think as Justice Marshall just pointed out, without the

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

4

Why not?
Because the Court -Doesn't it arise out of the assault in

the same way?

5

MR. WRIGHT:

The Second Circuit in 1954 essentially

6

read the phrase "committed by a government employee" into

7

the statute.

8

The government has not quarreled with that gloss on the

9

statute in the last 34 years.

10

QUESTION:

11

It is right there on Page 624 of the opinion.

But at least in terms of your literal

argument it is equally inconsistent with it, isn't it?

12

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, that's right, and I will say that

13

if

14

are to be drawn, all of which I would submit are caused by

15

that gloss on the statute.

drawing problems are particularly difficult.

occur in a fairly small number of cases.

25

last 34 years.
Heritage Reporting Corporation

16

1

I'd also, while discussing the extremely sweeping

2

language of this statute like to point to the Court's

3

opinion in Kosak, too, where the Court -- where the whole

4

issue, the dispute between the majority and the dissent was

5

whether "arising in respect of" is as broad as "arising out

6

of," which everybody agreed was simply extremely broad

7

language.

8

Petitioners have made three arguments designed to

9

evade the sweeping language of the statute, and I'd like to

10

address each in turn.

11

argument that Congress meant to bar claims involving batteries

12

only when the plaintiff asserts that the government is liable

13

under respondeat superior.

14

Their broadest argument is their

There is no basis for the distinction pettiioners

15

urge and that the Ninth Circuit has reasonably found.

16

language of the statute arising out of, any claim arising

17

out of assault and battery doesn't hint at a distinction

18

between respondeat superior and negligent supervision, as

19

four Members of this Court noted in Shearer, and as.

20

petitioners demonstrated in their brief, and noted a few

21

minutes ago, both theories, respondeat superior and

22

negligent supervision, were known to courts at the time the

23

Federal Tort Claims Act was passed in 1946.

24
25

QUESTION:

The

But the gloss words "committed by a

federal employee" does kind of remind us of respondeat

(202) 628-4888

17

superior, doesn't it?

2

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, but of course negligent

3

supervision claims arise most frequently for a tort

4

committed by an employee.

5

torts sets out the broadest case where someone can be

6

responsible for the tort -- for the intentional tort of

7

another, and that frequently occurs when an employee is

8

diligently supervised.

9

a footnote in our brief, but the language covers both.

10

Congress had intended to limit it in some way, it could have

11

done so, as the plurality noted in Shearer, by saying any

12

claim for assault and battery, because a respondeat superior

13

claim is a claim for the battery rather than arising out

14

of the battery.

since it was well known that there were these two theories

4

Well, that's the hardest case, and

QUESTION:

Would you give a different result in the

two cases?

5

MR. WRIGHT:

I have two responses to that.

First,

6

if you take the gloss added in Panella seriously, as if it

7

were really part of the statute, then in the one case where

8

with the government employee the intentional tort exception

9

would bar the suit, in the other case, where there's a non­

10

employee, the intentional tort exception would not bar the

11

suit.

12

That, we think, is a perfectly reasonable reading

13

of what Congress might have meant.

14

Panella didn't just grab committed by a federal employee out

15

of thin air, as I might say some of the other exceptions

16

that have been proposed do come out of thin air.

17

at what Congress was doing in 1946, and it is true that

18

Congress was focusing on torts committed by federal

19

employees. That was what was uppermost in their mind.

20

postal truck hitting a pedestrian was the prime case Congress

21

was after.

22

After all, the Court in

It looked

The

I might note that if a postal driver purposely

23

runs over somebody, the intentional tort exception bars that

24

claim, which certainly would seem anomalous from the stand­

25

point of the person who got hit, who suffers the same injury
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

19

1

whether or not the driver negligently hit him or intentionally

2

ran him over, and in cases like that the pedestrian has to

3

argue that the — in order to collect, that the postal driver

4

intentionally hit him — did not intentionally hit him,

5

wasn't out to get him.

6

from the language of the statute.

7

So there is that anomaly that flows

We think it's reasonable, Congress could well have

8

decided, as the Panella gloss has it, that Congress wanted

9

to preserve sovereigh immunity in those vast bulk of cases

10

where an intentional tort was committed by a federal

11

employee.

12

QUESTION:

But on your intentional, your driver

20 times and his boss knows it and keeps him on the job.

supervision or negligent hiring, on the ground that each --

the totality of the facts all arise out of intentional tort.

and all the rest of it.
Well, I think that the 1974

3

amendment to the Act makes quite clear that Congress under­

4

stood the Act to bar negligent supervision claims.

5

what the 1974 amendment did was, it's an exception to the

6

exception, so that when batteries are committed by law

7

enforcement officers under certain circumstances the govern­

8

ment becomes liable, and the background of that amendment was

9

that there were several incidents of no-knock raids repeated

10

over time, As the Court noted in Shearer, these obviously

11

flowed from negligent supervision of the policemen doing

12

that, and the amendment --

MR. WRIGHT:

should have known that.
QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but they have to prove it.

People can make false allegations.
MR. WRIGHT:

And the fact that the employee was

5

hired, and did this terrible thing usually goes a long way

6

to proving that he was negligently supervised.

7

I'd like to point out in this connection, I think

8

it's useful to take a look at exactly what the law is on

9

when people can be responsible for batteries committed by

10

third parties.

11

that out in some detail, and it's worth noting that Section

12

315 is quite clear that there's no general duty to prevent

13

someone from committing a battery.

14

special circumstance exists, and Section 317, as I mentioned,

15

is one of those that sets out the employer-employee relation­

16

ship, and employers are liable for intentional torts

17

committed by their employees outside the scope of their

18

employment under that section in a number of circumstances.

19

The restatement sections, 315 to 320, set

It's only where a

And I'd like to note that under Panella, under the

20

Panella gloss we think it quite clear at least that the

21

government can never be liable under Section 317.

22

that it's enough that if the tort was committed by a federal

23

employee, it's plainly -- the action is plainly barred. But

24

in any event, it is certainly the case that the plaintiff

25

cannot bring a suit based on the fact of the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We think

26

employee-employer relationship or anything like that, and I

2

think that petitioners agree with that.

sort of broadly state that of course the owner of the

hospital in this case would be liable even if Carr were just

5

a drunk who wandered in off the street.

They, however, just

We don't think that that's clear at all, and

7

petitioners have never specified where they think that

9

seemed to assume it as well, although the majority plainly

agreed with us.

11

Nor did the dissenting judge below, who

of them apply here.

13

anything else of that nature.

14

There is no parent-child rule, or

Finally, I'd like to turn to the Doe v. United

15

States argument, the argument that -- is that when there is

16

a special relationship to protect -- a special duty to

17

protect the victim, that those cases are different than

18

others.

19

The Seventh Circuit in January did indeed

20

essentially agree with that reading, and read, as the

21

dissent in that case pointed out, the phrase "except where

22

the government has a special duty to protect the victim"

23

into the statute, that's based on Section 320 of the

24

restatement of tort, which says that in such circumstances

25

people can be liable for batteries committed by others.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

27

1

We think,

first, that that case was wrongly

2

decided, that unlike the gloss added by the Court in Panella-,

3

the court -- the Seventh Circuit in Doe v. United States

4

simply did not identify any basis in the history or

5

structure of the Federal Tort Claims Act for the -- for what

6

it was reading into the Act, and petitioners haven't identi­

7

fied any other reason for reading such an exception into the

8

Act.

9

QUESTION:

I thought the -- if you are questioning

10

what the basis of the government's responsibility here

11

would be if it wasn't just the employment, I thought what

12

they are.contending is the adoption of regulations, which

13

perhaps they didn't have to be adopted, but the government

14

was a volunteer, and of course it's an old tort theory that

15

if you act as a volunteer you'd better do it right.

16

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, that's right, and that's our

17

second argument here, that in any event the special duty

18

argument doesn't arise here because contrary to

19

petitioner's -- the enactment of a regulation, the

20

regulation in this case anyway doesn't come close to

21

establishing a duty to protect petitioners.

22

Under restatement section 320 you have a special

23

duty to protect your wards, people you are custodians of,

24

like children in a day care center.

25

QUESTION:

That all goes for the basis of

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28

1

imposing liability, which is a matter of state law.

2

don't think that has anything to do with 2680(h).

3

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, that's true.

I

And our first

4

argument is that 2680(h) bars the claim on that basis.

5

we don't think that the Court actually even needs to reach

6

the issue of the day care center type case, because the

7

facts here are so short of showing any special duty to

8

protect the victim that -- the Court of Appeals essentially

9

dismissed this argument in one paragraph, and we think

10

correctly, because there's just no basis here.

MR. WRIGHT:

We

prefer just reading the gloss in its plain meaning, if you

will.

supervision claim based on the employment relationship goes

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. KATOR, ESQUIRE
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MR. KATOR:

Well, I hope I won't need them all,

4

Your Honor, but I guess my first point was, I'm sure that

5

there are a lot of people in Washington, D.C., who would be

6

surprised to know that regulations at Bethesda Naval are not

7

enacted for their protection.

8

any event, that is a question for the District Court.

9

I submit that they are.

In

Justice Kennedy, you asked the question, what if

10

the assailant had been an FBI agent, what would be the

11

liability in this case, and the government said, well, if

12

he is an FBI agent, therefore you could sue him directly for

13

his intentional tort.

14

I don't think that that's correct.

The legislative

15

history of the 1974 amendment makes it quite clear that

16

Congress was only waiving that with respect to FBI agents,

17

law enforcement individuals acting within the scope.

18

there is nothing in 2680(h) that says acting within the

19

scope, yet there is quite a bit elsewhere in the Federal

20

Tort Claims Act that says that.

21

1346(b) certainly says within the scope.

Now,

Congress was concerned with was federal employees acting

have known that this man posed a threat would not be able

25

The scope of the duty would focus on whether there

be gone if you are talking about duties that arise solely
