CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

this morning in No. 86-228, Kungys against the United States.
Mr. Williamson, you may proceed whenever you are

ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. WILLIAMSON

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WILLIAMSON:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is the reargument of a denaturalization case

10

y

The oral argument first

11

involving whether a final judgment of a federal court granting

12

naturalized citizen to an immigrant can be vacated on the

13

grounds he misrepresented in his immigration papers that he was

14

two years old, and that he was born in a city instead of a

15

town.

16

At the time the Petitioner was granted his

17

citizenship in 1954, Section 340 A of the Immigration and

18

Nationality Act of 1952, which is 8 USC 1451(a), provided, in

19

pertinent part, shall be the duty of the United States

20

attorneys to institute proceedings for the purposes of revoking

21

and setting aside the order admitting such person to

22

citizenship, and cancelling a Certificate of Naturalization on

23

the ground that such order and Certificate of Naturalization

24

were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful

25

misrepresentation.

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The District Court expressly found that the

1
2

Petitioner, had he given the correct information on his visa

3

application form, his visa nevertheless would have been issued,

4

and that there is nothing to suggest that his having been born

5

on September 21, 1915, in Reistru, would have had any effect

6

whatsoever.
The Court of Appeals agreed with that finding, and,

7
8

indeed, it did not declare that any of the findings of the

9

District Court were clearly erroneous as was required by Rule

10

52(a).

11

judgment of the District Court and by construing the

12

alternative approach to materiality in Chaunt, as permitting

13

proof that disclosure of Petitioner's true date and town of

14

birth would have resulted in an investigation notwithstanding

15

the fact that the District Court expressly found that the

16

government's own proofs indicated that no investigation would

17

have resulted.

18

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals, in effect, drew

19

an inference in favor of the government that the disclosure of

20

the truth of his correct date and place of birth would have led

21

to residency records in Germany, and from those residency

22

records you could draw a further inference that he was not a

23

victim of Nazi persecution.

24
25

A former vice counsel, but one who had not processed
the Petitioner's papers, had testified that that was an

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

ultimate disqualifying fact.

In other words, if you are not a

2

victim of Nazi persecution, you are not eligible for a

3

nonpreference "immigration visa".
However, as indicated by the statement at oral

4
5

argument by the government, there was no such statute.

6

was no such regulation, and therefore there is no ultimate

7

fact.

8

9

There

So the posture of the case at this point is that the
government has no proof of any ultimate disqualifying fact.

10

And their argument, therefore, is that Chaunt does not require

11

proof of an ultimate disqualifying fact.

12

argument is that any misrepresentation, irrespective of

13

materiality, is sufficient to have constituted a legal

14

procurement, because the words "illegally procured" were

15

reinstated in the Section 1451 by an amendment in 1965, which

16

was seven years after Mr. Kungys or the Petitioner was granted

17

his citizenship.

18

And their further

The short argument to the fact that a nonmaterial

19

misrepresentation cannot be the basis for denaturalization is

20

that the statute, Section 1451, explicitly requires that the

21

misrepresentation or concealment be as to a material fact.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Williamson, you say in effect

23

then that the part of 1451 that talks about misrepresentation

24

covers the waterfront so far as denaturalization is concerned,

25

and that you can't bring other forms of misrepresentation in

5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

i

Under the head of illegally procured?

2

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Yes, what I argue, and in fact what

3

I think is reasonable clear is that when Congress sets forth

4

that the basis for denaturalization when it comes explicitly to

5

a misrepresentation must, in effect, be procured by a

6

concealment of a material fact, that is clear language; clear

7

in the sense that it certainly the requirement of materiality

8

is clear.

9

To argue, in effect, because there are

10

nonmisrepresentational forms of conduct that can in effect

11

constitute illegal procurement irrespective of whether there is

12

a misrepresentation, i.e., such as if a person has contracted a

13

dangerously contagious disease and is unaware of, they could

14

still be denaturalized; i.e., if a person engaged in rape and

15

if there was no such question asking whether you, in effect,

16

had engaged in rape; or whether or not you had aided the

17

illegal entry of other aliens, those are the examples which

18

were used in the legislative history in 1961 to indicate the

19

reason for the change.

20

But that doesn't mean in point of fact that when you

21

attempt to use illegal procurement as the arguments made by the

22

government in the case of Fedorenko, and there is an

23

interesting statement in the brief on page 18 of solicitor

24

general, whether Petitioner's citizenship is considered to be

25

illegally procured, or procured by misrepresentation, the

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

primary basis for its revocation, Petitioner's false

2

representations concerning his whereabouts during World

3

War II.
Accordingly, we agree that Petitioner's wartime

4

r

5

activities, specifically his guard duty at Triblinka must be

6

shown to be material facts within the meaning of 8 USC 1451(a).

7

That was the case -- the government argued that in Fedorenko in

8

its brief.

9

case.

This is the brief of the United States in that

And, indeed, that particular portion of the brief, I

10

believe, was the basis when Justice Marshall speaking for the

11

majority in Fedorenko indicated that notwithstanding the fact

12

that the petitioner there had misrepresented his country of

13

birth on his visa, but that did not end the judicial inquiry.

14

Justice Marshall speaking for the majority court said,

15

agree with the government that that does not end the judicial

16

inquiry, because the test is still materiality."

17

"We

Indeed, the question there was still materiality as

18

to whether or not the status of being a concentration camp

19

guard, in effect, was a predicate for denaturalization.

20

indeed, that particular case was an illegal procurement case.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WILLIAMSON:

23

QUESTION:

And,

Mr. Williamson.
Yes.

Even if you are correct that there is a

24

requirement of materiality, ordinarily a material fact is one

25

that is important to the decision-maker, rather than one that

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

is necessarily decisive.

Isn't there a difference there?

V

2

You seem to be arguing that materiality means it has

3

to be a fact that is decisive rather than something merely

4

important to making the decision.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

5

r

Yes.

I think it's an academic

6

discussion on behalf of the client I represent, because I don't

7

think the misrepresentations that he made in his petition for

8

naturalization or his visa application were even important.

9

However —

10

QUESTI ON:

Well, certainly that's debatable.

11

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Yes.

However, not important in the

12

sense that it obviously could not have affected the decisions

13

to whether the visa, and it certainly doesn't affect the

14

ability to grant the citizenship.

15

But I would also state --

16

QUESTION:

17
18

But it might be important to the decision

whether to grant it.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, once the decision is made to

19

grant the visa, the vice counsel loses his jurisdiction.

20

that point in time its a judicial determination, and the

21

determination of what is important or not important goes to the

22

question of whether, (a) he was eligible in the first instance,

23

or (b) whether he was in the categories that are excludable.

24
25

At

And this traces all the way back, and it's very
interesting because I traced the history as to whether or not

8
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

even with respect to a visa, it had to be a material fact and

2

one which is beyond important, i.e., that is really is decisive

3

because that is the alternative dictionary meaning.

4

great consequences is one of the definitions which I saw in a

5

dictionary.
QUESTION:

6

Having

Well, what if we think it means just

7

important to the decision?

8

i

9

that in light of the nature of the misrepresentations which

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, then I would argue, in effect,

10

were made in preceding cases, that none of these

11

misrepresentations rise to the dignity of those particular

12

cases.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Williamson, suppose these lies were

14

told expressly with the intention of getting a benefit under

15

the immigration laws?

16

MR. WILLIAMSON:

17

QUESTION:

Well —

Would that not be a material

18

misrepresentation?

19

because the lies he told were believed, and whoever the

20

immigration officer was consequently accommodated him and gave

21

him the visa.

22

And if he succeeded and he got the visa

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, let me say this.

If in fact

23

it was not a false perception, in other words, if indeed he

24

perceived that these lies were significant, then merely the

25

question of intent --

9

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

I am just wondering whether or not he did.

2

If in fact they were told, for the purpose of getting something

3

from the immigration officer, and he succeeded, wouldn't that

4

end the inquiry?

5
6
7

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, according to Judge Learned

Hand, it would not.
The cases trace back all the way to the case of

8

United States v. Iorio Day.

9

petitioner there, or the person who sought to obtain the visa,

There is a case in which the

10

denied that he had ever been in prison.

11

perceived that denying that he had ever been in prison was

12

significant and that his perception would naturally be that

13

that would influence the vice counsel.

14

Obviously, he

What Judge Learned Hand said in Iorio v. Day was it's

15

true that the relator is bound to tell the truth.

16

he suppressed was irrelevant to his admission, its mere

17

suppression would not debar him.

18

But if what

So the first question comes down to at most whether

19

the facts, had he disclosed them, would have been enough to

20

justify the refusal of a visa or exclusion upon entry.

21

appellant did not suppress from the vice counsel facts which

22

would have justified in refusing a visa had he disclosed it.

23

So that in other words --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WILLIAMSON:

The

Was this speaking of 1101, or was it 1451?

No, this was speaking in terms of

10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

what is the predicate necessary to deport an alien.

2

particular instance, what Judge Learned Hand was addressing

3

himself was the 1924 Act.

4

which this Petitioner was brought in.

5

addressing himself to 1001.

6

was, in effect, whether or not this particular immigrant could

7

be, or alien could be deported because his visa wasn't valid.

8

9

QUESTION:

And he was not

What he was addressing himself to

says there as far as 1451(a) is concerned.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

11

QUESTION:

13

The 1924 Act is the same act under

Well, he may be quite correct in what he

10

12

In that

Right.

I thought we were talking here about a

materiality requirement for 1101(f)(6).
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, 1101(f)(6), in my judgment,

14

does not come into play, because, in effect, 1101(f)(6) is

15

simply the means of determining whether or not a person is

16

qualified for naturalization.

17

Scheiderman has always distinguished between naturalization and

18

denaturalization.

19

And this court as far back as

Here, in effect, we're not talking about the burden

20

that the applicant has to bear in order to be naturalized.

21

We're talking about the burden that the government has to bear

22

in order to vacate a judgment of a court.

23

course, the evidence has to be clear, convincing,

24

unequivocable.

25

QUESTION:

And that's why, of

Shifting the burden doesn't -- shifting

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the1burden of who has to prove it doesn't change what has to be

2

proven.

3

MR. WILLIAMSON:

No, I think that the distinction

4

covers more than shifting of the burden.

5

to the very nature of the right that is at stake.

6

believe that, as Justice Blackman indicated in his concurring

7

opinion in the Fedorenko case, that once we discuss the

8

question of citizenship already granted, in order to vacate it

9

the only section of the statute which applies is 1451(a).

10
11

The distinction goes
And I

But in any event, each of the courts that have
addressed this issue --

12

QUESTION:

Textually, how do you get to that?

13

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, textually the way that I get

14

to it is that 1451 states the requirements for

15

denaturalization.

16

the misrepresentation of a material fact.

And it states that it must be procured by

17

When it comes to illegal procurement, as Justice

18

Brennan indicated in the Costello case, the reason for the

19

inclusion of the language of misrepresentation of material fact

20

was to distinguish between intrinsic fraud and extrinsic fraud,

21

but clearly it was not the situation given a lucid definition

22

of misrepresentation.

23

There is nothing in the legislative history to

24

suggest that.

There is nothing in the legislative history to

25

suggest the incorporation of 1101, or 1101(f)(6).

12
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

So that I

1

would suggest that the distinction goes beyond the mere burden

2

of proof.

3

But in any event, getting back to Justice O'Connor's

4

question if I may, I think that it's more than simply the mere

5

dictionary meaning.

6

Black's Law Dictionary addresses I think a more pertinent

7

aspect of it, because it goes to the question of material fact

8

in the context of the law, in the context of a contract, and

9

the contracts of insurance policies, in the context of a

When we look at Black's Law Dictionary,

10

pleading, in a context, for example, of a Motion for Summary

11

Judgment.
In those particular instances the cause and effect

12
13

relationship of materiality, it's without which the particular

14

contract wouldn't have been granted.

15

wouldn't have issued.

The insurance policy

So in this particular instance, it has to be more

16
17

than simply important.

18

believe the language of the statute indicates that pretty

19

clearly, because it doesn't simply say material fact in the

20

abstract.

21

by, not could have been procured by, but procured by -- very

22

strong word.

23

It is a but for requirement, and I

It says procured by, not capable of being procured

And again as indicated by Justice Douglas, it was

24

referred to in the other opinions, fraud and misrepresentations

25

are strong words.

Strong words require a vigorous burden of

13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

proof.

They require a vigorous application before we vacate a

2

judgment of a court.

3

soft definition of a harsh term.

4

And what the government is seeking is a

So to merely say it's important, I would suggest,

5

does not do justice to the rights that are at stake here.

6

These consequences of denaturalization are far more serious

7

than fine and imprisonment.

8

fine and imprisonment, and I don't mean to trivialize the fact

9

of lying.

And I don't mean to trivialize

Obviously, lying is not to be encouraged.
On the other hand, anytime that a person "lies" it

10
11

doesn't necessarily mean that under any of the statutes the

12

mere fact of lying results in consequences.
QUESTION:

13
14

I don't know.

This was all about 1947,

was it?

15

MR. WILLIAMSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Most of these visas were?
Yes.

18

i

19

officers, I gather, handling these applications, did we not?

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

And we had a great many immigration

MR. WILLIAMSON:

There was clearly a policy that

21

because of the pressures in Europe, because of so many

22

displaced persons that were there, that there was all efforts

23

were to be made to bring these immigrants in.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, suppose, however, there were an

administrative practice at that time that if anyone admitted

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that he had lied, as Kungys did, that automatically he would be

2

denied a visa.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

3
4

But there wasn't any such

administrative practice, and indeed —

5

QUESTION:

I'm just asking what if there had been.

6

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, if there had been, then the

7

question really would be, in effect, is would that have been

8

totally -QUESTION:

9

In other words, if he didn't confess that

10

he had lied, that as soon as they detected that he had he would

11

automatically be denied as a matter of administrative practice.

12

MR. WILLIAMSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Lying as to anything?

Yes.
If he lied as to anything, then I

15

would suggest that the vice counsel is not the final

16

determinant.

17

been the counsel, attorhey counsel for the State Department.

18

And in turn, that would be reviewed by a court.

The final determinant at that time would have

When those situations at that time were reviewed by

19

20

the court such as in the Tepper case, Judge Irving Kaufman

21

indicated in that case the question is not whether or not the

22

vice counsel would have decided that he lied, and therefore

23

would have in effect denied the visa.

24

or not he had done so on a ground specifically excludable by

25

law.

The question is whether

And the fact of the matter is that the regulation then in

15

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

effect specifically stated that the grounds of exclusion are

2

those grounds which are specifically listed in the application

3

for the visa, and any law is not set forth there.

4

What is set forth in the visa application refers to

5

misrepresentation as to a material fact.

6

been a material fact.

7

The test has always

Indeed, getting back to Justice Scalia'S question

8

about whether or not you could bring in other statutes.

The

9

fact of the matter is that the courts have never held that any

10

lie even in those statutes.

They have, in effect, engrafted a

11

judge made interpretation of even 1001, but notwithstanding the

12

langauge "any misstatement".

13

misstatement, so it excludes innocuous lies.

It means, in effect, any material

14

In addition to which the courts have even accepted

15

the question of the exculpatory no, because, for example, on

16

this visa application what you had was the specific question,

17

18(c) I believe it was, have you ever in effect made any

18

misrepresentations in order to gain benefits under the act.

19

The simple answer is no.

20

The courts have engrafted into similar language under

21

1001, the defense that's not covered by it because otherwise in

22

effect you would be violating the privilege against self­

23

incrimination and other particular policy considerations.

24

we have always looked to the question of materiality.

25

QUESTION:

So

Well, Mr. Williamson, don't we have to go

16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

through -- isn't it necessary to go through the same sort of an

2

inquiry at the naturalization stage?

3
4
5

Something might be immaterial at the visa stage and
quite material at the naturalization stage.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Yes, I agree that you must go

6

through the inquiry at the naturalization stage.

7

for example by virtue — in Fedorenko.

8
9

But, again,

In Fedorenko, Fedorenko indicated to the examiner at
the time that he had lied with respect to his country of birth.

io

And the examiner at that time said that's of no concern to us.

11

So in point of fact, it really comes down to whether at that

12

stage, and again it's not any lie, but whether or not they

13

could have legitimately denied naturalization.

14

question would be the significance of a lie.

15
16
17
18

Let me give an illustration.

QUESTION:

Well, at the naturalization stage if he

had said, yes, I lied on my visa application.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

20

QUESTION:
did you lie about.

MR. WILLIAMSON:

23

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

Then there would have been an inquiry what

22

24

Suppose, for example,

we had a --

19

21

And the

Correct.

And you would have gotten into where he

lived and what he did at the critical time, wouldn't you?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Well, what you have gotten into is

17

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the truth.

And the question is what is the consequence of the

2

truth, and that's what we have said that the test was in

3

Chaunt.
QUESTION:

4

Well, living in this particular -- living

5

in this particular city might have — at that time might have

6

meant something different to the person presiding over the

7

naturalization than --

8

MR. WILLIAMSON:

9

QUESTION:

-- over the visa.

MR. WILLIAMSON:

10

Not in this case.

Not in this case.

The District

11

Court specifically held, relying upon the evidence of the

12

government of vice counsel, the residence in Kedainiai was of

13

no effect whatsoever.

14

QUESTION:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KLONOFF:

15
16
17
18

Thank you, Mr. Williamson.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The denaturalization laws are quite clear.

There are

two separate grounds for denaturalizing someone.
Number one, a material misrepresentation ground, and

19

number two, illegal procurement.

20

responded to our textual argument that illegal procurement is a

21

separate and distinct form of denaturalization.

22

QUESTION:

And Mr. Williamson has never

But, Mr. Klonoff, ordinarily when you are

23

construing a statute such as 1451, the section we're talking

24

about, where it covers quite elaborately the ground of

25

misrepresentation as the basis for denaturalization, and then

21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

something else is there, illegal procurement, you would not

2

think that illegal procurement embraced also misrepresentation

3

which is elaborately covered in virtually the next sentence.

4
5

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, I have two answers for that, Mr.

Chief Justice.
First of all, as we have explained, the requirements

6
7

for false testimony under illegal procurement are quite

8

different than the requirements for material misrepresentation.

9

And there are category of cases in which the government could

10

prove illegal procurement, but not material misrepresentation

11

and vice-versa, and I'll get to that in a minute.
The second point, however, is that that is simply not

12

13

the way the legislative history suggests Congress was focusing

14

on this.

15

reveals that Congress' purpose was to bring in all of the

16

1101(f).

The illegal procurement legislative history in 1961

Now Mr. Williamson says that this court should pick

18

and choose.

19

not have good moral character, and Congress made clear in 1961

20

that individuals who lacked good moral character could be

21

denaturalized under an illegal procurement theory.
Now if it were correct that Congress did not want to

22

23
24
25

But Congress said that 1101(f) defines who does

bring -QUESTION:

Simply because they lacked it, they had to

do nothing but lack it at the time?

22

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I mean, let's suppose they made no misrepresentations

1
2

concerning the fact that they had been convicted of a murder

3

which is one of the bases of bad moral character.
MR. KLONOFF:

4

Well, textually that's a different —

5

the statute 1101(f)(6) does not refer to false testimony about

6

the other subsections of (f).

7

testimony given for the purpose of obtaining immigration

8

benefits.
QUESTION:

9

It talks about any false

No, but let me finish my question.

The fact is that this individual had been convicted

10
11

of a murder, didn't misrepresent anything about it.

It is

12

later found that he had been convicted of a murder.

And you

13

say that the illegally procured language in 1451 then enables

14

the government to back, because it made a mistake when he was

15

naturalized, to denaturalize him.

16

MR. KLONOFF:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's correct.

And in fact that --

Any mistake in the original naturalization

can form the basis for denaturalization under 1451.
MR. KLONOFF:

19

Well,,not any mistake.

It has to -- if

20

somebody was naturalized when they did not meet the

21

requirements for naturalization can be denaturalized.

Does that mean -- I wanted to follow up

on that if you don't mind, Judge Scalia.
Does that mean a habitual drunkenness is a basis for

not being of good moral character?

understand then, that the government would always be open to

It says so in so many words.
We think that when Congress in '61

restored illegal procurement, they were talking about

individuals who got in who had committed murders, for example,

15

but were never asked, did you commit a murder.

was frustrated at the fact that in those cases where somebody

17

never qualified for naturalization the government was powerless

to act.

category of people who were not entitled to citizenship in the

first place.

25
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. KLONOFF:

1

That's not the view that this court has

2

taken.

I was going back, for example, to the Ginsberg case

3

where the court said that where somebody didn't meet the

4

qualification of citizen because a proceeding was held in

5

chambers rather than open court, the court said this person

6

lacked a statutory requirement for citizenship, and therefore

7

it was illegally procured.
All I can suggest is that the court examine the

legislative history in '61, because we would submit it's fully
consistent with the position we are taking.

11

QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question.

12

I hadn't reexamined the Fedorenko case, but your

13

opponent seemed to say you shifted your position.

14

correct?
MR. KLONOFF:

Is that

We did not, Mr. Justice Stevens.

In

16

counsel's reading of our brief, he failed to note an important

17

fact.

18

court in Fedorenko.

19

QUESTION:

20

Namely, the government did not argue 1101(f)(6) to this
We were not addressing that issue at all.
But what he read seemed to suggest that

you in effect conceded that it would not apply.

21

MR. KLONOFF:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KLONOFF:

We conceded --

Or at least impose any higher standard.
We conceded with respect to Section 10

24

of the Displaced Persons Act that there was a materiality

25

requirement as to that statute.

And as we explained in our

26
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

supplemental brief, we think the purposes of the Displaced

2

Persons Act were quite different than the purposes of good

3

moral character statute, 1101(f)(6), and that it was

4

appropriate, we felt, for a court to read materiality into

5

Section 10.
We in no way addressed whether there was a

6

7

materiality requirement under 1101(f)(6).

8

QUESTION:

So any position you advanced in Fedorenko

9

would still be your position.

10

MR. KLONOFF:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KLONOFF:

Absolutely.

We have no --

We can rely on that.
— question, number one, as to the

13

material misrepresentation aspect.

14

of concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation.

15

We don't retract our concession that the misrepresentation must

16

be material also.

17

1451(a).

18

The statute speaks in terms

That's under the material misrep part of

We similarly have conceded, and still do that there

19

is a materiality requirement under Section 10 of the DP Act.

20

But this is quite a bit different for two reasons.

21

Number one, neither one of those statutes in any way

22

addressed someone's good moral character.

And as we have

23

explained, someone who deliberately lies under oath for the

24

purpose of obtaining immigration benefits, we submit, does not

25

possess good moral character.

So the purposes are quite

27
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

different, we would submit.

2

QUESTION:

And, therefore --

So if you deliberately lie under oath for

3

the purpose of obtaining naturalization, you do not possess

4

good moral character even though the misrepresentation may not

5

be material.
MR. KLONOFF:

6

That's our position, and on the other

7

hand the government has to show that the person's intent was to

8

obtain immigration benefits.

9

a difficult burden.

And as we have explained, that's

And ordinarily if a lie has absolutely

10

nothing to do with any of the issues of immigration, it's going

11

to be exceedingly difficult for the government to show that the

12

person's intent in lying was to obtain immigration benefits.
QUESTION:

13

Indeed, there is not a whole lot of

14

difference between that and a materiality requirement, is

15

there?

16

MR. KLONOFF:

17

QUESTION:

Well, there is a difference.

You have to assume that the person is

18

stupid; that is that although he thinks this fact does not have

19

any significant bearing upon whether he will be naturalized or

20

not, he nonetheless lies about it.

21

MR. KLONOFF:

I don't think you have to -- you have

22

to assume that someone is misinformed.

23

example that may illustrate the point.

24
25

Let me just give an

An individual is applying for a government benefit,
let's say naturalization or a visa, and his wife is present.

4

age.

And so in order to

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KLONOFF:

The person with the intent

-- no materiality?
Well, if he is mistaken that age has

10

nothing to do -- I'm assuming no materiality just for purposes

11

of the hypothetical.
That person clearly lacks good moral character, we

12
13

would submit, regardless of whether age is material.
QUESTION:

14

Do you think a young man who lies about

15

his age to get into the Marines never could have good moral

16

character?

17

MR. KLONOFF:

18

QUESTION:

19

It really would —

Under your argument, I would think he's

conclusively presumed to have bad moral character.
MR. KLONOFF:

20
21

conclusive presumption.

22

inventing.

23

I'm not sure.

We think that Congress made that
This isn't something that we're

We are construing the statutory language.
Let me just round the situation out.

Let's say that

24

age is fundamentally important to the decision that's being

25

made, but the person doesn't know this.

He lies about his age

29

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

not because he's trying to obtain immigration benefit, but

2

because his wife is sitting there next to him and throughout

3

their marriage he has lied about his age and he doesn't want to

4

tell the truth.
Now, that type of lie is willful.

5

He clearly was

6

lying deliberately, but he wasn't lying to obtain immigration

7

benefits.

8

He has made a material misrepresentation and it's willful, but

9

he doesn't fit within the good moral character provisions.

That is where the material misrep provision fits in.

So we would submit that the two statutes really do

10

11

reach out to different types of people, and that that is

12

precisely what Congress intended.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Klonoff, did the District Court in

14

this case ever determine the purpose for which the Petitioner

15

lied?
MR. KLONOFF:

16
17
18
19
20

He did, Justice O'Connor.

And

QUESTION:

Was it determined that it was for the

purpose of obtaining immigration benefits?
MR. KLONOFF:

He did.

I would refer the court to

21

page 120(a) of Petitioner's appendix.

The District Court, in

22

describing the visa documents, stated that the documents were

23

false in that they stated the defendant had not previously

24

given false testimony to obtain benefits under the Immigration

25

and Naturalization Laws.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

QUESTION:

You are reading from 120(a) of?

2

MR. KLONOFF:

120(a) of the Petitioner's appendix.

3

The paragraph beginning, "On October 3, 1953".

4

half of the second sentence.

It's the second

The court necessarily had to have found in making the

5
6

observation that Petitioner lied on his visa papers that the

7

reason for his lying was to obtain immigration benefits.

8

Otherwise, he would have been telling the truth.
QUESTION:

9

Well, now you are relying on the sentence

10

that says, "The documents were false as to defendant's date and

11

place of birth."

12

MR. KLONOFF:

13

QUESTION:

Right.

"And in that stated that defendant had not

14

previously given false testimony to obtain benefits under the

15

Immigration and Naturalization Laws."
MR. KLONOFF:

16

That's correct.

If the District Court

17

believed that the purpose of the lie was not to obtain

18

immigration benefit, he could not have made that finding.
QUESTION:

19
20

But it's a rather opaque finding, isn't

it?

21

MR. KLONOFF:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, it isn't —

It's certainly not explicit.
Well, we think that if -- I mean, there

24

is no other explanation for that statement other than that the

25

court concluded that the purpose of the lies was for

31
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

immigration benefits.
It's consistent, by the way, with the rest of the

2

3

District Court's opinion, because the District Court concluded

4

that the government didn't qualify in 1101(f)(6) grounds for

5

one reason; namely, his conclusion that 1101(f)(6) required

6

materiality.
Had the District Court felt that the Statements were

7
8

not given for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits,

9

one would have assumed, given this thorough opinion, that the

10

District Court would have rejected the government's argument

11

not only because of the materiality point, but also because of

12

the purpose of the lies.
We think that when that statement is read in

13
14

conjunction with the court's finding that the government didn't

15

qualify under 1101(f)(6) only because of the materiality which

16

the court read into the statute, we think it is reasonably

17

clear.

18
19
20

I would agree that the court did not state
affirmatively, I hereby find, but we think that that's -QUESTION:

Well, not only that.

We don't really know

21

from -- it's not only secondhanded sort, but it's also that we

22

don't know what test the court was using with respect to the

23

language for the purpose of obtaining benefits.

of lies about age that you have just given us.

Well, certainly there is absolutely

nothing in the opinion to suggest to the contrary, we would

16

submit.

17

that was not its purpose.

18

somebody would lie about these things, but we think that this

19

is the closest thing there is to a finding, but let me follow

20

up on that because this relates to points we made both in our

21

opening and our supplemental briefs.

22

I mean, the District Court certainly didn't say that

what the District Court was talking about.

It isn't as clear

as it could have been in the sense of elaboration.

that it's sufficient for a finding, but let me respond further

14

to your question.

We submit

Somebody who lies in order to get ahead of the pack

15
16

or to push the process along absolutely fits within what the

17

government is arguing here, because the court has to remember,

18

this is a quota system, and the quota is going to run out.

19

if somebody lies to get ahead of the pack, he's going to get a

20

visa that otherwise would have gone to someone else who went

21

through the honest process of getting correct identification

documents.

That's

Wow, that's a tough position, and I think

there are probably a lot of people that are excludable.
MR. KLONOFF:

Well, let me say that whether or not

8

there are people excludable under what Congress defined, that

9

shouldn't necessarily bear on the statutory construction issue,

10

It's for Congress to decide whether or not that is a correct

11

policy of excluding people who made those kinds of laws.

12

13
14

I would refer this court to two recent cases in the
deportation context:

Hector and Phinpathya.

Phinpathya, it was available to the alien to make all

15

kinds of absurd arguments that a brief absence from the United

16

States would totally disqualify somebody for claiming

17

suspension of deportation.

18

the plain language of the suspension statute required that any

19

absence broke that continuity of physical presence, and that it

20

was for Congress to change the law.

21

QUESTION:

And this court held correctly that

But here you are not dealing with anything

22

quite as clear as the plain language.

What you are talking

23

about is the phrase "illegal procurement" inserted into Section

1451 in 1961.

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, we don't think that — our

3

argument does not depend on legislative history.

4

Congress restoring the words "illegal procurement" is quite

5

clear that somebody who lacked a qualification for citizenship

6

could be denaturalized.

7

We think that

That's the text of the statute.

You go on and look at the '61 legislative history,

8

and that fully corroborates the government.

We would submit

9

that in an analysis of statutory construction the burden should

10

have been on the petitioner to come in and show through

11

legislative history that Congress meant something else..

12

The legislative history bolsters our argument, but it

13

is no way essential to it.

dispositive.

15

We think that the text is

Let me move briefly if I could to the issue of

16

materiality unless there are any more questions on the

17

1105(f)(6) point.

We would agree with the observation made by Justice

19

O'Connor, and in fact that's central to our argument of

materiality.

22

dispositive fact.

23

That in no other area of the law, and Petitioner

Now the government has argued for a criminal standard

24

of materiality.

It has also construed Chaunt as a would/might

25

test as I have explained previously the last time the case was

2

whether or not the court goes with the would/might test, or the

3

criminal test, or some other test, for example, the TSC test,

4

the important point that the government is making here is that

5

this court should not require proof of a dispositive fact.

6

In that regard, let me just note counsel's heavy

7

reliance on one case, the Day case from 1929, the Second

8

Circuit case.

9

several reasons.

But

It has nothing to do with the issues here for
It wasn't a construction of 1451, and

10

furthermore, I would urge the court to look at Landon v. Clark

11

which we cite in our brief, the First Circuit case from 1956,

12

which traces the law subsequent to Day, and indicates that even

13

in the Second Circuit the court had backed away from any

14

requirement of a dispositive fact.

15

And we would submit the law is quite clear as we have

16

laid out in our brief, both before and after Chaunt, that the

17

courts have not required a dispositive fact in order to

18

establish materiality.

19

reasons why this court should reject the argument of the

20

dispositive fact.

21

We would submit that there are several

First of all, our interpretation is more consistent

22

with the text of the statute.

If you were to require a

23

dispositive fact under the material misrepresentation clause,

24

that would essentially render that ground for denaturalization

25

meaningless, because the government would have demonstrated

1

illegal procurement in every case, and it would be entirely

2

irrelevant whether the person lied or told the truth.

QUESTION:

But, of course, that's only true if we buy

4

that part of your first argument.

5

illegal procurement quite as broadly as that, I think.

6

MR. KLONOFF:

I mean, we have not yet read

Well, we would submit that in Ginsberg,

7

even in Fedorenko itself, the court has read illegal

8

procurement to mean somebody who obtained citizenship without

9

possessing the statutory qualifications.

10

If the court is going to retreat from those cases,

11

then it's an open issue. But we would submit that Fedorenko

12

traces the law from Ginsberg to that decision.

13

that that is the law; that illegal procurement dealt with

14

someone who didn't possess the requirements.

15

our argument depends on that link.

16

We would submit

But that is true,

Secondly, and I'll only briefly touch upon this, a

standard that requires a dispositive fact gives the alien every

incentive to lie, as Justice White pointed out in his

There is some deterrent with the

naturalization and where the fact it's being hidden is really

buried in his past, and one could safely hope that he cOuld get

I submit that there is no difference in kind between

language referred to in Section 1101(f)(6).

V

1

whether or not the court made a finding when it simply was, in

2

effect, addressing itself to the question of the check mark on

3

to gain admission, I think that the court in context was simply

4

indicating that the same misrepresentation was repeated in the

5

petition, because that was contained on page 120 of the

6

Appendix C.
But if you go back to page 118, the court makes a

finding.

It says,

"I cannot understand what benefit defendant

9

expected to achieve by placing his birth in Kaunas rather than

10

Reistru, by dating his birth October 4, 1913 rather than

11

September 21, 1915."

12

the correct information, his visa would have nevertheless been

issued.

And the finding that had defendant given

Later on in the opinion at page 123, the court simply

15

reasserts that the government asserts that he lacked the

16

prerequisite of good moral character because he gave false

testimony for purpose of gaining benefits under the Act.
That's not a finding of fact.

18

That's a conclusion of

19

20

of the requirement materiality as perceived in Fedorenko.

It's an erroneous conclusion of law, because of the fact
