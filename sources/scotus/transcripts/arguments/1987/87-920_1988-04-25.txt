ORAL ARGUMENT BY MAURICE G. KNAIZER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. KNAIZER:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The issue before the Court today is whether the State

11

of Colorado may prohibit payment to persons who are circulating

12

petitions to get an initiative measure on the ballot so long as

13

it does not otherwise prohibit payment or otherwise limit the

14

amount of money which proponents may spend.

15

The purpose of the initiative in Colorado is to

16

provide an alternative means through which the popular will may

17

be expressed.

18

to petition the government.

19

but in fact extensive inherently.

20

the public may pass, actually pass legislation when the

21

legislature, because of the influence of special interests, has

22

ignored the public will.

23

It is an addition to the already existing right
It is not a limit on the right,
It provides a means by which

The initiative provisions provided for in the State

24

Constitution and by Colorado statute are designed to ensure

25

that the initiative remains a true alternative through which

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

•

integrity of the process remains in tact.
3

W

In order to secure the purposes, the people of the

4

State of Colorado, through both its constitute and its

5

statutes, have set forth procedures which must be followed

6

before a petition can get access to the ballot.

7

£

the collective will may be expressed, and to ensure that the

The petition circulator in this process plays an

8

absolutely crucial role which is in part set forth by the

9

constitution.

He is not only the person who circulates the

10

petition, but by constitutional provision he is also the one

11

who transforms the petition into prima facie evidence that the

12

signatures on the petition are in fact true and correct, and

13

that the signatories are also registered electors of the State

14

of Colorado.

15
16

QUESTION:

What qualifications does he have to have

under state law?

17

MR. KNAIZER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KNAIZER:

To be a petition circulator?

Right, for that august function?
Well, the only qualification that he

20

needs is to be a registered elector which in Colorado means

21

that he must be a resident of the State of Colorado, and

22

actually registered to vote.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. KNAIZER:

25

Can he be a convicted felon?
If he is a registered elector, then

even if he is a convicted felon, yes, he can be permitted to

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

conduct the petition circulation.

i

QUESTION:
3

I suppose he could also be at it if he had

been convicted of election fraud, too.
MR. KNAIZER:

4

If he is allowed to vote.

I believe

5

under Colorado law that if you are convicted, you may not be

6

allowed to vote, but, frankly, I am not sure of that.

7

he is allowed to vote and if he is registered, yes, indeed, he

8

can do that.
QUESTION:

9

But if

Mr. Knaizer, there is, I take it, a state

10

law in Colorado prohibiting and making a criminal offense the

11

use of forged signatures on these initiative measures?

12

MR. KNAIZER:

13

provision in the state statutes.

14
W

QUESTION:

That is correct.

There is a forgery

And there is a requirement that every

15

person signing the initiative measure must be a qualified

16

voter?

17
18

MR. KNAIZER:

Every person signing the initiative

must be a registered voter; that is correct.

19

I think there is one important point here.

The issue

20

involved in this case is not necessarily just one of

21

prohibiting forgery.

22

this particular statute wasn't the fact that it was forgery.

23

It was the fact that it was difficult to determine whether or

24

not the people who were signing the petitions were in fact

25

qualified people.

One of the reasons for the genesis of

5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

What had happened historically was that, at least

1

2

between 1910 and 1941, was that Colorado had no prohibition on

3

petition circulators, that is, paying them.

4

though, it became apparent that there were some abuses which

5

occurred.

6

circulators, in order to enhance the income that they were to

7

obtain from the circulation process, started to allow the

8

petitions to circulate without actually observing the

9

signatures being made.

And basically what happened was that petition

In fact, those facts were outlined in the case of

10
11

In the late '30s,

Brownlow v. Wunsch which we had cited in our brief.
So the legislature felt that the process was itself

12

13

being undermined by the fact that nobody really knew who was

14

signing.

15

It wasn't necessarily just a question of forgery.
QUESTION:

Does the form of the initiative

16

circulation require the circulator to verify under oath that

17

everyone signed in his presence?

18

MR. KNAIZER:

19

Yes, the voters who are signing the

petition don't have to sign an affidavit.

20

QUESTION:

No, but the petition circulator has to.

21

MR. KNAIZER:

22

QUESTION:

The petition circulator must --

And it would be a criminal offense to

23

falsely swear that people had signed in the circulator's

24

presence if that were not the case.

25

MR. KNAIZER:

It would be a criminal offense to

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

falsely swear, that is true.

2

I would like to add, though, that the criminal

3

offense may not be enough in this case to satisfy the

4

particular problem.

5

when it was discussing the question of whether or not criminal

6

sanctions were sufficient with regard to contributions, the

7

Court noted that only in blatant sorts of cases would the

0

criminal offenses be sufficient.

9

As this Court noted in Buckley v. Valeo

There was some concern expressed by the Court in

10

Buckley about a prophylactic sort of measure in certain

11

instances to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption,

12

and we believe that's what has occurred in this particular

13

case.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Are there any other states that have this

particular provision prohibiting the use of paid circulators?
MR. KNAIZER:

There were, but the courts have fairly

17

frequently repealed, or not repealed, but declared the statutes

18

to be unconstitutional.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Do you know of any other state presently

that makes use of the initiative which has such a law?
MR. KNAIZER:

I believe Washington may.

Nebraska did

22

until about a month ago, and for the last three or four years

23

those have really been the only states which have had the

24

prohibition.

25

QUESTION:

The election in question here, the

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

•

initiative measure was for a constitutional amendment having to
do with removal of motor carriers from the jurisdiction of the

3

Public Service Commission?

4
5

MR. KNAIZER:

QUESTION:

7

MR. KNAIZER:

And the election has long since passed.
The election has long since passed,

that is correct.

9
10

It was deregulating the

transportation industry in general.

6

8

That's right.

QUESTION:

Has that provision ever been enacted, the

change, the proposed change?

11

MR. KNAIZER:

Oh, the deregulation.

12

No, it has not.

13

QUESTION:

14

moot, in your view?

And is it still an issue?

The case is not

w

15

Well, no.

In our view, it is not,

16

because in Colorado this question arises every general

17

election.

18

w

MR. KNAIZER:

It arises every two years.
So, for example, in Colorado now there are two or

19

three measures which people are trying to get on the ballot.

20

And so for us it's an issue that comes up every two years, and

21

we feel it's the sort of issue that is capable of repetition

22

yet evading review.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Knaizer, was there some basis for the

24

legislature singling out petitions that were circulated by

25

people who were hired to do it as opposed to volunteers?

8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

i

Were they considered to be a greater cause of this
evil of not being sure that you've got registered voters to

3
4

sign it?
MR. KNAIZER:

Yes.

As I understand the legislative

5

history, the legislative — the prohibition was designed

6

specifically to take care of a problem which in fact existed.

7

As I had mentioned in the case --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Well, you described the problem as being

the fact that the circulators did not really pay any attention
to who was signing.

11

Did the legislature focus in some way on the fact

12

that they thought paid circulators were more guilty of this

13

type of activity than unpaid?

14

MR. KNAIZER:

There was no legislative history that I

15

could find at the time.

16

was between that case of Brownlow v. Wunsch, which outlined the

17

facts, and the fact that in the next legislative session the

18

legislature prohibited paid petition circulators.

19

The only connection that we could make

In that Brownlow v. Wunsch case, the Supreme Court

20

made specific mention of the potential abuses that could occur

21

because of paid petition circulators.

22

it out, and in the next legislative session, and in that time

23

it was held biannually, the Court took care of the problem by

24

singling out paid petition circulators.

25

QUESTION:

The Court itself singled

Could you spell out those abuses?

9
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. KNAIZER:

1

QUESTION:

2
3

You speak generally of abuses.

I would

like to know what they were.
MR. KNAIZER:

4
5

Well, the abuses that were --

Okay.

The abuses were essentially —

well, let me back up a little bit.
One of the concerns that Colorado has is that there

6
7

be a significant modicum of support for each measure.

And, of

8

course, that is determined by the number of signatures that you

9

get.
And so if the measure is circulated, you really

10
11

don't, and the petition circulator is not there to observe, you

12

really don't have an idea if the people are reading the

13

provision, have read the provision, understand it.
There also is the possibility of fraud but, frankly,

14
15

that wasn't -- as far as I could tell in Brownlow v. Wunsch,

16

that was not an issue in that case.
QUESTION:

17
18

solicitors, too?
MR. KNAIZER:

19
20

Isn't that true with respect to volunteer

There has been no indication at least

in Colorado that it was true.
Can it happen?

21

Yes, it can happen.

To our

22

knowledge, it hasn't occurred, at least in the State of

23

Colorado.

24
25

QUESTION:
happen.

Don't you think it's more likely to

It seems to me the legislature's judgment is

10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

absolutely counter-intuitive.

Let's assume I am running a

2

business, petition circulators, and I get paid for circulating

3

petitions and getting signatures.

4

Don't you think that I would be much more concerned

5

about having my petition thrown off the ballot because of too

6

many signatures that weren't valid than would, you know,

7

innumerable volunteers who just go around and get signatures?
I would think that there is a market incentive for

8
9

10

the paid circulator to be sure that he's getting proper
signatures.

And what incentive is there for the volunteer?

MR. KNAIZER:

11

Well, I would think that the opposite

12

in fact may be true, because the volunteer, at least conceived

13

under the Colorado law, really has an interest in getting the

14

measure on the ballot, and wants to make sure the measure stays

15

on the ballot.

16

sure that the process is handled correctly so that his measure

17

can ultimately succeed.

18

just interested in getting the money, and perhaps maybe hopeful

19

that he doesn't get caught by padding the petitions.
QUESTION:

20

21

So he would have more of an interest in making

out?

You think he doesn't care if it's grown

It seems unlike to me.

22

MR. KNAIZER:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Whereas the paid circulator is really

I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part.

It seems unlikely to me that a paid

circulator would not care.
Do you know whether these paid -- are there any

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

•

businesses of paid petition circulators, or is it the case that
most of the paid circulators are people who in fact favor the

3

measure but they just can't afford to take a day off from their

4

jobs?

5

know, we have some funds and we'll pay you half of what your

6

salary is if you take the day off to circulate on behalf of the

7

cause.

So the organization that furthers the measure says, you

MR. KNAIZER:

8
cJ

There is a growing

industry where firms are actually paid to circulate petitions.

10

In fact, in California, it's my understanding that it's a

11

multi-million dollar industry.

12

However, there are circumstances such as existed in

13

this case where basically it is people who want to take a day

14

off, or want to pay somebody to substitute for them.

15

really do get a combination of both.

QUESTION:

There is no question

May I ask if it's a violation of the

QUESTION:

1

No, the daughter is not.

My assumption is

2

that the parent is a registered elector, and the parent will

3

sign the statement and the affidavit that will ask the kids in

4

the family to take them to people that the parent reasonably

5

believes to be electors.

6

Would that violate the statute?

7

MR. KNAIZER:

8

QUESTION:

That would violate the statute.

Because it just says — as you read and

9

describe in your brief, you say they sign an affidavit saying

10

that each signature is a signature, to the best of their know,

11

is the person whose name it purports to be, and that to the

12

best of their knowledge and belief each person is -MR. KNAIZER:

13
14

15
16

Well, really what that is geared to is

But I do not think the statute requires

that you witness the signatures, does it?
MR.

17

KNAIZER:

Well, there was -- I believe in that

18

same Brownlow v. Wunsch case, there was an — well, that was

19

before --

20

QUESTION:

Well, that was before that was enacted.

21

MR. KNAIZER:

But there hasn't been any case that

22

interpreted that particular statute.

23

to make sure that the person who is signing his name is the one

24

who he purports to --

QUESTION:

But the whole purpose is

No, in the circular it says, to the best

13

of my knowledge and belief, he is registered.
MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

Right.

So I assume normally what happens is you

meet somebody on the street and you say, are you a registered
voter.

He says, yes, and you can sign him up.
MR. KNAIZER:

No, our belief is that sending your

daughter out would violate the statute.

You are really

supposed to witness the signature.
The earlier cases of Brownlow v. Wunsch did say that
if you actually recognize the signature, you could -- that
would be satisfactory.
takes care of that.

But I think the passage of this statute

And as far as I know, the practice has

been to require the petition circulator to actually observe the
signing of the petition.
QUESTION:

Of course, that is the safest, but I am

not sure the language of the statute commands that.
MR. KNAIZER:

Well, that is the way the Secretary has

interpreted it over the years.
QUESTION:

Now, how has it been interpreted?

Has

this been a lot of litigation interpreting this statute?
MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

No, in fact —

Have there been many cases interpreting

the statute?
MR. KNAIZER:

14

The registered elector, as I

That provision was put in

It used to be that there was -- that the only person

15

who could circulate the petition was a qualified elector.

16

qualified elector was just basically a resident of the state

who in fact may or may not want to vote, and may or may not

18

have been registered.

19

A

The people of the State of Colorado, in the

20

constitution in 1980, determined that they wanted to basically

21

upgrade the position of the petition circulator by making him a

registered elector.

because they really wanted to establish not only ties to the

24

community, but also ties to the election process.

But a paid elector has to meet -- a paid

MR. KNAIZER:

A paid circulator has to meet that

requirement.

But the problem with the paid circulator is that

6

there is an inducement — there is basically another God, if

7

you will, another boss.

The purpose of the petition circulator is to verify

signatures.

16

paying him at that point, you perhaps give people the

17

impression that he may not be concentrating on his job of

18

verifying signatures, but may in fact be adding signatures in

order to increase the income he could have from the circulation

20

of the petition.

I think what the

election judge is doing when he signs you in is conduct, and

what is happening with the petition circulator, at least with

Amendment protection here?
MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

Speech —

Political issues, and issues of public

concern, and what's at stake here is whether the person putting
this measure, proposing to put it on the ballot can expend
money to have that message carried to the voters?
MR. KNAIZER:

The people in Colorado can expend money

in any fashion to bring that message to the voters.

The amount

of money is unlimited, and the types of things that you can
spend the money on -QUESTION:

Well, they want to spend it on paying

people to offer to voters the petitions.
MR. KNAIZER:

The people who circulate the petitions

can't speak, they cannot be paid.

It is true that the people

in this case want to pay the petitioners.

However, the people

of the State of Colorado, in passing the constitutional
amendment regarding initiative, said that the petition
circulator has to be the verifier.

It is the general will of

the people that the verification process becomes the primary
function.
Now the proponents of a particular election can
choose to mesh the two.

But if there is a conflict, then the

primary function set out by the statute is in fact the one that
has to take precedence.

QUESTION:

Counsel, when the petition circulator

accosts somebody on the sidewalk and says, are you a registered
voter, and the man says, yes, how does he verify that?
MR. KNAIZER:

He just takes the word of the

registered elector.
QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference whether he's

paid or not?
MR. KNAIZER:

Well, the elector also has certain

other functions other than to verify that it's a registered
elector.

He has to verify in fact that the person who signs

the petition is the one who -- is the one who actually signed
it; that is, nobody sign for him.
QUESTION:

Nobody verified that he's a voter.

MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

So there are more functions.

Nobody verifies that he's a voter.

The problem of my own experience in that

sort of work is not that a lot of people from New York would
sign this petition in Colorado, but that a circulator is going
to open up the phone book and just write a bunch of names and
addresses out of the phone book in kin do phony handwriting
that nobody -- that no one ever signed.
Now is that part of the evil?
MR. KNAIZER:

That's part of the evil.

I can tell

you that that was a fact that was found by the courts, but in
fact I think that's part of the concern.

That's a more blatant

aspect of it, but it definitely is part of the concern.

•

Well, certainly it would, because the state can have
3

an interest in guaranteeing, you know, 5 percent of the

4

populace support this.

5

obviously you are not going to have your 5 percent.
The state had an interest in preventing -- certainly

6
7

the state can regulate conduct that defeats that 5 percent

8

modicum of support.

9

QUESTION:

Well, what if a circular just goes out and

10

offers $2.00 to everyone who will sign if you are a registered

11

voter and otherwise qualified, can the state prohibit the

12

offering of money for perfectly good signatures?
MR. DANKS:

13

I believe it can, because the goal is to

14

have 5 percent of the people sign, and by signing they are

15

stating that they want this issue on the ballot.
QUESTION:

16

Well, presumably if they sign, they are

17

doing whatever the state says they should do to have the issue

18

on the ballot, but they are also getting two bucks for it.
MR. DANKS:

19

Well, they may be, but then you have a

20

factual issue as to whether they signed it for the $2.00 or in

21

order to get it on to the ballot.
QUESTION:

22

So you say the state could prohibit the

23

payment of money to people as a consideration for their

24

signing.

25

ft

And if you have forged signatures,

MR. DANKS:

Yes, and then we get into a balancing

a problem.

That's a direct method of dealing with

In other words, a prohibition directly against

3

paying someone to sign the petition, whereas this ia a very

4

indirect method in which we are somehow saying that by paying

5

someone as an advocate they are more likely to go that extra

6

step and then pay the person for actually signing the petition.

7

It's that second leap that I am arguing is not proper; that the

8

statute can deal with the problem directly.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Danks, I'm sorry to come back to this,

10

but it's a point that's very important to me.

11

really not enough for me that it's within the realm of

12

possibility that one of these Plaintiffs might be involved in

13

another initiative.

14

I am afraid it's

Do you think it's probable, likely that any of them

15

would?

Isn't one of the individual Plaintiffs an officer in

16

the Libertarian Party?

Paul Grant.

We're talking about a case that was four years

ago, and I'm not trying to say that this case is moot.
3

when we were unable to pay petition circulators, this hurt our

4

effort, and it took a lot of momentum out of the movement.
Nancy Bigbee I would say is probably the principal

mover behind this issues at today's date, and she wishes to go
forward with it.

Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MAURICE G. KNAIZER, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL
MR. KNAIZER:

13

But

I would just like to make a brief

14

comment.

15

Court to understand and to review what the initiative process

16

really is, and the fact that the whole process and the way it

17

was designed by the people of the State of Colorado was to

18

provide for additional public discourse.

19

of the State of Colorado, through its legislature, believed

20

that this prohibition is designed to provide exactly that; it's

21

a narrowly drawn prohibition that was designed to attack one

22

problem, the problem that in fact existed in the legislature's

23

eyes, and that is all that is prohibited.

25

I think when reviewing this case, we would like the

QUESTION:

6

MR. KNAIZER:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

Is fraud in or out?
Fraud is in as an underlying purpose.

7

I do agree with Mr. Danks that there was a statement made at

8

the hearing in the district court that fraud was not an issue.

9

I would also like to point out, though, that in the district

10

court's opinion, Judge Moore's opinion, he indicated a concern

11

for the integrity of the process because of padding of

12

petitions, and there was a statement in the case regarding

13

padding of petitions by the expert for the State of --

QUESTION:

15

MR. KNAIZER:

16

Isn't that fraud or not?
Not necessarily, and that's the

distinction.
QUESTION:

17

That's the whole point.

I thought that in

18

your initial presentation you said fraud wasn't — perhaps

19

wasn't as important as something else, which I take it you

20

think isn't fraud, if you paid the -MR. KNAIZER:

MR. KNAIZER:

The petition circulator may be in a

position where he decides to pass the petition around.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

And he doesn't see who signs it.

But you say that he is supposed to witness

the signatures.
MR. KNAIZER:
QUESTION:

He is supposed to witness --

And if he turns in his certification

representing that he did, isn't that fraud?
MR. KNAIZER:

Well, that is fraud, but I was talking

about the signature of the electors themselves.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Knaizer.

The case is submitted.
