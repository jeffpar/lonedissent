ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

11

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case, the Appellees are executors of estates
that included among their property state or local public
housing agency project notes.
The question before the Court is whether testamentary

12

transfer of those project notes is exempt from the federal

13

estate tax.

k

P

14

In urging that the testamentary transfer is not

15

exempt, we have two grounds, either of which would

16

independently support a judgment in our favor.

17

Our principal contention is that the transfer of such

18

notes never was exempted from the federal estate tax by the

19

Federal Housing Act of 1937, the so-called Wagner Act.

20

other contention is that even if they had been so exempted,

21

Congress repealed that exemption in 1984 for taxpayers situated

22

such as the Appellees, and that contrary to the District

23

Court's holding, the application of that repealer provision was

24

not unconstitutional.

25

Our

There are three reasons why we urge that the Court
3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

should address our principal contention first, that the

2

transfer never was exempt from federal estate tax.

3

The first is that if we are correct about this

4

statutory issue, it avoids the necessity of addressing a

5

constitutional contention or even the necessity of construing

6

the effect of the 1984 Repealer Provision in light of the

7

constitutional argument.
The second reason why we believe that question should

8

9

be addressed first is that there are presently pending, the

10

Internal Revenue Service has done a survey on this, 101 cases

11

which would not be disposed of were the decision to rest on

12

grounds of the scope or constitutionality of the 1984 Repealer

13

Provision because there were 101 cases pending, either

14

administratively or in the courts, with a total value of

15

project notes at issue of slightly more than $90 million, in

16

which the returns were filed after the Haffrier decision came

17

down in 1984, and no tax was reported as owing on those

18

returns.

19
20

They are cases that would be controlled by whether or
not Haffner was correctly decided, and --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Was that in the 7th Circuit?
That was the 7th Circuit case.

And did the Government just lie still for

that or
MR. WALLACE:

We did not petition for writ of
4

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1

certiorari for Haffner.

2

that time, and Congress had already enacted a retroactive

3

repealer.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WALLACE:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

T see.

All right.

So, we â€”

Rested on your expectation that you would

win a case like this?
MR. WALLACE:

8
9

We had no conflict in the circuits at

Well, we didn't think that our future

course here would be enhanced by tacking certiorari denied on
to the 7th Circuit's decision.

11

So, we did not petition there.

Now, this is not in

12

our judgment an issue that should have to be briefed and argued

13

twice in this Court and, therefore, there is some merit in

14

deciding the issue that would dispose of all of the cases.

k

)

First, now it is true that we do not presently have a

15
16

conflict in the circuits on that narrow question, but we do

17

believe that the impetus of decisions has turned in our favor

18

with this recent decision of the Tax Court by an eleven to five

19

vote called Estate of Egger, which is referred to in our reply

20

brief, and which we have furnished for the Court's convenience.
QUESTION:

21
22

the Tax Court, too, didn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

23
24

Mr. Wallace, the present case came up from

The present case is from a District

Court.

i
25

QUESTION:

From the District Court.
5
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. WALLACE:

It's on appeal from the District Court

for the Central District of California.
QUESTION:

And Haffner came out of the Northern

District of Illinois?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is this the first time the issue was

reviewed by the Tax Court, by the full Tax Court?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The first time?

MR. WALLACE:

It is the first Tax Court decision on

the issue.
QUESTION:

And you have five dissents or something

like that?
MR. WALLACE:

There were five dissents, but eleven

votes agreeing with our position, and I would add that the Tax
Court's opinion seems to us to be the fullest and most
persuasive treatment of the issue thus far by any court.
QUESTION:

And the Tax Court held that the bonds were

not intended to be exempt under the 1937 Act?
MR. WALLACE:

Under the 1937 Act, which was the only

issue before the Tax Court since the Repealer Provision would
not have affected the Tax Court cases.
Now, the third reason why we think that the Court
should first consider that question is because we think it is
the correct answer that Congress never did have to
6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

retroactively repeal an exemption that never existed, and so

2

far as we can tell, that's what Congress itself thought when it

3

enacted the Repealer Provision less than three months after the

4

District Court decision in Haffner without even waiting to see

5

whether the Court of Appeals would affirm or reverse the

6

District Court.

7

Now, on this issue, the District Court in our case

8

simply relied on the District Court decision in Haffner.

9

we'll turn to the analysis used by the District Court in

10
11

So,

Haffner.
That decision surely is one of the most remarkable,

12

is one of the most remarked-upon tax decisions of our time, in

13

that it discovered a tax exemption that had lain dormant for

14

almost forty-five years, a tax exemption of very elastic scope,

15

which had gone unnoticed by the Tax Bar, unclaimed by

16

taxpayers, and unrecognized by either the Internal Revenue

17

Service or any court for a period of almost forty-five years,

18

and the Court did so while conceding in its opinion that the

19

language used by Congress in the 1937 Act would not in itself

20

be sufficient to confer this exemption.

k

21

That language is set forth in the Appendix to our

22

brief on pages 2A and 3A at the very end of our brief.

It's

23

Section 5(e), which provides in the second sentence that

24

obligations issued by these local public housing authorities

25

and then skipping to the end of the paragraph "shall be exempt
7

)

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

from all taxation now or hereafter Imposed by the United

2

States".

3

As the Tax Court recently said in Estate of Eqqer,

4

that language had been definitively interpreted by this Court

5

as well as other courts by 1937, at the time the Wagner Housing

6

Act was enacted, and it had been definitively interpreted to

7

apply to taxes on the obligations or the income themselves,

8

income or property taxes, and not to taxes on the transfer of

9

the securities, namely estate or gift taxes.

10

The interpretation of such statutory provisions, and

11

we have collected the cases on pages 18 and 19 of our brief, in

12

a lengthy footnote as well as in the text, the interpretation

13

was closely tied in to the constitutional question of the

14

validity of the estate and gift tax in light of the requirement

15

of Article I, Section IX of the Constitution, that direct taxes

16

must be apportioned among the states, and the reason why

17

nothing comparable to the Sixteenth Amendment to the

18

Constitution authorizing the income tax had to be adopted for

19

purposes of the estate and gift tax is because the Court in the

20

cases we cite had definitely held that the estate and gift

21

taxes are not taxes on the obligations, but are taxes on the

22

act of transfer.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Then, Mr. Wallace, why would there be

specific exemption language in Section 20 of the earlier act?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that brings me, Mr. Justice, to
8

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1

1

the first ground relied upon, we think erroneously, by the

2

Court in Haffner, the difference in the drafting between this

3

language we just looked at in Section 5 and the language that

4

appears on the next page, which is Section 20(b) of the 1937

5

Act, a provision which has not existed in the Act since 1949,

6

and that is referring to obligations of the Federal Housing

7

Authority, a federal agency, which was to furnish money to the

8

state agencies.

9

It says that though it shall be exempt, both as to

10

principal and interest, from all taxation, except sur taxes,

11

estate, inheritance and gift taxes, now or hereafter imposed by

12

the United States or any state or local taxing authority.

13

The principal difference, and we think the basis of

14

the error in the Haffner case, is that looked upon in

15

historical context, this was a much more limited exemption from

16

income taxation.

17

really divided into two taxes; what was basically the flat rate

18

at a rather low level income tax, and the graduated aspect of

19

it, called the sur tax, and the taxable income was defined

20

slightly differently.

21

From 1913 until 1954, the income tax was

The determination was made with respect to the

22

federal obligations that they, unlike the obligations of the

23

local housing authorities, would be exempted from the flat tax

24

which, in 1937, was a four percent tax, but they would not be

25

exempted from the graduated aspect of the income tax.

The sur

tax.
And, therefore, it was necessary in drafting this

2
3

provision to put in an exception to accomplish the result

4

Congress wanted to accomplish, to say except sur taxes.

5

an exception was mentioned, then cautious draftsmanship would

6

call for enumerating all the exceptions to ward off the

7

possibility of an argument that expressio unius est exclusio

8

alterius, as it's sometimes called.

9
10

QUESTION:

Once

But you just told us that this wasn't an

exception, that the language simply didn't cover it.

11

MR. WALLACE:

The language would have covered sur

12

taxes.

So, it was necessary to have an exception for sur

13

taxes.

This could be --

>
14
15

QUESTION:

That is a true exception, but you just

told us that the exemption of any transfer taxes â€”

16

MR. WALLACE:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

-- is not really an exemption.
It might not have been necessary, but

19

it was a draftsmanship devise used out of an abundance of

20

caution and it was not something peculiar to this statute.

21

We have on page 29 of our brief collected a number of

22

references to other federal statutes.

This was the standard

23

mode of including exemption from taxation for federal

24

obligations, whereas 5E reflected the standard mode that was

25

used in formulating an exemption from state obligations which
10
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1

1

was a broader exemption.

2

We have in the Footnote on page 29 and in the related

3

text, a number of other examples that use the same standard

4

mode.

5

The other point to be kept in mind is that these two

6

provisions were not drafted simultaneously.

7

carried over from a bill that was first drafted in 1935. It was

8

carried over to another one in '36, and then finally to this

9

one in '37, whereas Section 5E was drafted in 1937, almost

10
11

Section 20(b) was

surely by different people.
So that it is as we term in our reply brief,

12

fallacious to compare the two as if they were intentionally

13

drafted by the same person to accomplish two different results.

14

Instead, they are reach a standard form of accomplishing what

15

was an established result at the time.

16

I'd like to turn next to the remaining items in the

17

legislative history that are relied upon either in the

18

opinion or in our opponent's briefs in this Court.

19

mind, however, that relying on these matters, none of which is

20

unequivocal as we shall see, is really contrary to the

21

established principle stated over and over again by this Court,

22

that tax exemptions do not rest upon implication.

23

be unequivocally stated in the text of the statute.

24

Haffner

Keeping in

They have to

So, the entire inquiry that was undertaken in Haffner

|
25

once the Court admitted that the language used by Congress
11
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

,

1

would not support the exemption was really contrary to this

2

Court's decision.

3

The first thing relied upon was a statement made on

4

the Floor by Senator Walsh in the course of a lengthy statement

5

interrupted by many colloquies, many of which consisted of

6

corrections of things that Senator Walsh had been saying, and

7

the particular paragraph from the Congressional Record, Iâ€™d

8

like to read it in full, so the Court will get the flavor of

9

it, was as follows:

10

"Obligations, including interest thereon, issued by

11

public housing agencies and income derived by such agencies on

12

such projects are to be exempt from all taxation now or

13

hereafter imposed by the United States.

14

bill gives the public housing agencies the right to issue tax-

15

exempt bonds, which means they are free from income tax, sur

16

tax, estate, gift and inheritance taxes."

1

17

In other words, the

It is that appositional clause which means, which is

18

the basis on which the Appellees and the Court in Haffner

19

relied on, Senator Walsh's statement.

20

Our view is that this is simply a mis-description of

21

what the meaning is for a bond to be exempt from all taxation.

22

What it means to issue a tax-exempt bond that had been clearly

23

established in the Court's cases, and it was stated in a way

24

that suggested that this would be the ordinary tax-exempt

25

bonds, such as municipal bonds, which have never been exempt

1
12
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

from estate and gift taxes, and he was merely parathetically

2

describing the attributes of a tax-exempt bond.
This is not the way that the Congress unequivocally

3
4

would adopt so pronounced a change from the ordinary way of

5

doing business

6

other local bonds.
QUESTION:

in conferring tax exemptions on municipal and

Massachusetts or Montana?

This was Montana. The Massachusetts.

I'm sorry.

11

I thought he was the other one.

I'm confused by it. David Walsh of Massachusetts.

There is some confusion about what his precise role

was with respect to the bill.

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

But the point is that Congress, surely the members of

Yes, Mr. Justice.

24

Congress, would have been alerted in a more telling way than

25

this if a departure were intended from the ordinary principles
13

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

governing the scope of tax exemptions.

After all, the House of

Representatives did not even have the benefit of Senator
Walsh's mis-description in the course of his statement at all,
and there was no indication that it came across to the members
who were hearing it, anything more than the notion that the
ordinary attributes of tax-exempt bonds were being conferred
here.
Some question is raised about why no one rose to
correct this when other corrections had been made of other
errors in Senator Walsh's statement. Well, this is quite
understandable when you look at the context in the
Congressional Record. As he finished there, he yielded to
Senator Davis of Pennsylvania, who raised another point with
respect to his statement.
As I understand it, Senator Davis said the local
authorities wild be granted some $700 million and then there is
a colloquy between Senator Walsh and Senator Davis about the
size of the initial appropriations and what they expect it will
be in the future, and when that finally ends, Senator Walsh
says, "Mr. President, I think I am now prepared to submit the
few amendments I have to offer."

So, they just went on to

something else, and one could hardly attribute significance of
the sort required for an unequivocal conferral of a tax
exemption to the fact that no one happened to rise at an
inopportune moment on the Floor of the Senate to correct this
14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

1

mis-description that occurred in the course of Senator Walsh's

2

remarks.

3

Now, the two other matters on which the Appellees and

4

the Court relied are, if anything, even less substantial.

5

is the fact that an alternative bill, the Ickes Bill, had a

6

more comprehensively-drafted exemption provision.

7

bill that differed in many important respects from the Wagner

8

Bill .

9

One

That was a

A written statement was submitted to the committee on

10

behalf of Secretary Ickes, describing in some detail the

11

differences between the two bills, no mention was made of any

12

difference in tax consequences between the two bills.

13

the Wagner Bill that was reported out of committee. There was

14

no indication that anyone on the committee thought that a

15

choice was being made with respect to tax consequences of these

16

project notes, and certainly even less reason to think anyone

17

on the Floor was aware of any difference in the draftsmanship

18

between the two bills.

It was

19

And, finally, the reference is made to a speech that

20

was made by a federal official after the enactment of the

21

Wagner Housing Act, a speech by Mr. Warren Vinton, which

22

expressed the view that these notes would be exempt from

23

transfer taxes.

24

on the subject.

That speech displayed considerable confusion

construe the tax laws.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

12

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Rotstein.

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. ROTSTEIN, ESQ.

14

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

15
16

He was

MR. ROTSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes down to whether the United States

17
18

Government may refuse to return a citizen's money for no other

19

reason than that the Government has acquired possession of that

20

money and the District Court quite properly answered that

21

question in the negative.

22

I'll turn first to the question as to whether project

23

notes are exempt from federal estate tax under the 1937 Housing

24

Act.

25

As the Government recognized, the starting point is
16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the statutory language. Section 5(e) of the '37 Act, which

2

exempted project notes unequivocally from all taxation now or

3

hereafter imposed by the United States.

4

contained a much more limited exemption for federal housing

5

obligations, not project notes.

6

exempt from all taxation except inheritance taxes relative to

7

estate taxes.

8

QUESTION:

Section 20(b)

These obligations were

Mr. Rotstein, if all we had before us was

9

the language of Section 5(e) and we didn't have the language in

10

Section 20, would you concede that the Government's position is

11

correct in that we would not ordinarily give that broad

12

language such a broad effect?

13

MR. ROTSTEIN:

Your Honor, I would so concede if

14

there was not also the legislative history. I believe, although

15

it would be a tougher case, if you had the legislative history

16

plus just the Section 5(e) exemption, I would still say that

17

project notes are exempt.

18

here because you do have Section 20(b).

19

Fortunately, you have a simpler case

Now, the Government argues that Section 5(e) doesn't

20

exempt project notes by relying on a line of cases, beginning

21

with Murdock v. Ward, which holds that exemptions for all

22

taxation in certain circumstances relating to bonds don't

23

include an exemption for the estate tax. These cases make a

24

distinction between a direct tax on a bond and a transfer tax.

25

The courts recognized recently that this is a
17
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

1

formalistic distinction without economic consequences, and

2

significantly none of the statutes considered in the Murdock

3

line contain statutory language like 1937 Act, that has two

4

sections; one with a blanket exemption and one with a more

5

limited exemption.

6

Similarly, none of the cases in the Murdock line

7

consider statutes as legislative history.

8

that Congress intended to bestow an estate tax exemption on the

9

bonds.

10

So, it clearly shows

Now, we discussed the legislative history in our

11

brief.

I won't repeat it here.

It is unequivocal.

I just

12

want to comment, make the comment that the Government really

13

offers no affirmative history to the effect that Congress

14

intended to subject project notes to the estate tax, and absent

15

such affirmative evidence, there's no reason to disregard the

16

plain meaning of the '37 Act and the legislative history

17

affirmatively showing that project notes were exempt.

>

18

And, so, the Government actually resorts to â€”

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, the legislative history you rely on

is the statement of Senator Walsh, I gather?

21

MR. ROTSTEIN:

Well, it's the statement of Senator

22

Walsh plus the version, the rejected version, of Secretary

23

Ickes, which contained a reference to estate tax and Section

24

5(e).

25

legislative history with post-enactment, but we believe that
18
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

Well, --

You may call it a formalistic distinction,

but the fact is when you tax the bonds, you're imposing an

10

annual tax or some other tax on the bonds themselves.

11

estate tax does not apply until -- unless and until there's a

12

transfer.

15

So, it's really a tax on the transfer.
You may call that formalistic, but that's plain

13
14

This

language.
MR. ROTSTEIN:

It is a tax on the transfer.

We're

16

not denying that, but the plain language argument is simply

17

that when you look at the '37 Act and compare Section 5(e) and

18

20(b), it couldn't mean anything, 5(e) could not have any other

19

meaning than a congressional intent to exempt project notes

20

from the estate tax, read in light of 20(b) as the statutes are

21

to be read.

antagonism to the District Court's interpretation of Section

2

5(e) .

3

They first argue that Section 5(e) couldn't have

4

exempted project notes from the estate tax because to do so

5

would have resulted in wholesale avoidance of estate tax.

6

First, this is merely an impermissible attempt to

7

have the Court rewrite the 1937 Act, but, second, it's

8

inaccurate.

9

from being concerned that all taxpayers are going to run out

In 1937, when Congress passed the 1937 Act, far

10

and buy project notes, they were concerned that there wouldn't

11

be a market for them.

12

So, from the perspective of the 75th Congress,

13

there's no reason to believe that they were concerned and, in

14

fact, there's reason to believe that the estate tax exemption

15

was an incentive to make project notes saleable.

16

The Government also argues that Section 5(e)

17

exemption couldn't include an exemption from estate tax because

the Tax Bar was taken by surprise.

I'll next turn briefly to the question of the proper

1

2

interpretation of Section 641(b)(2) of the Deficit Reduction

3

Act, which the Government says, irrespective of what Section

4

5(e) means under the 1937 Act, retroactively taxes the estates

5

here.

6

As we discuss in our brief, it's a proper

7

construction of Section 641(b)(2) that it should not be

8

construed retroactively.

9

constitutional questions raised by retroactive interpretation.

10

That will avoid the serious

I just want to make two additional points to the ones

11

we make in our brief.

12

Section 641(b)(2) by implication repeals an estate's right to

13

sue for refund, and it does so by implication.

14

Under the Government's interpretation,

This right has been established for decades and given

15

the fact that there was very little, if no, legislative

16

consideration of Section 641(b)(2), it's not plausible that

17

Congress would have had such an intent.

18

This leads to the next point and that is when, in

19

enacting DEFRA in 1984, Congress wanted to repeal a right to

20

refund, it said so explicitly. They did so in DEFRA Section

21

2662(g), which, in much clearer language, makes the statute

22

there retroactive and in the legislative history of which

23

Congress specifically said that they wanted to repeal a right

24

for refund.

25

So, juxtaposing 641(b)(2) with 2662(g), as a matter
21

(202)

1

of statutory construction and, I believe,

2

the conclusion that in enacting Section 641(b)(2), Congress

3

didn't intent to mcike the section retroactive, and that has the

4

presence for a non-retroactive interpretation in the opinions

5

of this Court in Schwab v._Doyle and Hassett v. Welch.

6

Now,

logic, would lead to

I want to indicate what will happen here if the

7

Government's interpretation of Section 641(b)(2) as being

8

retroactive prevails, and that is that taxpayers are going to

9

be encouraged in doubtful cases to take aggressive positions

10

vis-a-vis the taxability of an item.

11

That is, in a doubtful case, because Section

12

641(b)(2) retroactively applied penalizes the reporting

13

taxpayer, the conservative taxpayer, the taxpayers will be more

14

likely not to report a doubtful item.

15

In other words, taxpayers will be encouraged to play

16

the audit lottery. This goes against mainstream tax thinking

17

and congressional thinking that has been established for years

18

and the concomitant costs to the Government,

19

evident. There will be unreported taxable transactions -QUESTION:

The Government argues that. There's no

describes Section 641(b)(2) as permitting certain taxpayers who

21

did not report project notes as taxable but not the estates

here "to continue to litigate the questions of taxability".

At the same time, the Government describes the effect

of Section 641 as permitting the non-reporting taxpayer "to go

(202)

died the same day as Dr. Stein, but who failed to file a return

at all for the purpose of evading other taxes.

15

The only real justification that the Government

offers for the classification of Section 641(b)(2) is that it

17

gives its expectations as to the decedents' belief as to

taxability.

is equivalent to the taxpayer's expectations.

It gives effect to those expectations.

In other

forth the rationale classification.

relied on the tax laws.

It's not a rationale gauge.

that a taxpayer may either choose to sue in the District Court

are many reasons unrelated to a taxpayer's expectation as to

9

That's especially true in a case like this where the

notes were taxable, contrary to what the law is, and even after

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

Thank you, Mr. Rotstein.

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Rotstein has devoted most of his argument to the

In both cases, the claim for a refund was not filed

until after the District Court's decision in Haffner came down.

In the Wells Fargo case, this was two and a half years after

It's quite apparent that they acted not in reliance

upon their thoughts at the time of filing the returns, but in

6

reliance upon the Haffner decision.

with that, but no matter how Congress acted, unless it was

going to go into a case-by-case determination, it could not

satisfy everybody's expectations with respect to the Haffner

case.
Even if the new statute had been completely

12

prospective, not every taxpayer who, after Haffner came down,

13

might have transferred his assets into project notes in

14

reliance on Haffner, would have had the foresight to die before

15

June 19th, 1984, and, therefore, those taxpayers' expectations

16

would have been thwarted notwithstanding their reliance on the

17

Haffner decision.

18

And as this Court's leading modern case on the

19

retroactivity of tax legislation, United States v. Darismont in

20

449 US, explains in detail most tax legislation has some

21

retroactive effect.

22

the rule of Darismont made the entire repealer retroactive and

23

treated all taxpayers the way they had all been acting for the

24

previous forty years and the way the future ones would have to

25

act, namely paying tax on the transfer.

Here, Congress surely could have within

selecting a very restricted class of persons that would be

confined to those in the same situation as the Haffner

taxpayers who had done something in reliance on this, but did

5

make it retroactively applicable to the great bulk of

6

taxpayers, most of whom would be just applying for an

unexpected windfall if they happened to fall within the dates

I believe we're ready to submit the case, unless
there are further questions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Wallace, if you'd stand

12

there for just a minute, our records show that this is your

13

hundredth appearance before this Court, and that your first

14

argument here was in a case argued March 25th, 1968, for the

15

Government.

16
17

On behalf of the Court, we'd like to extend to you
our thanks for your able advocacy during this period of time.

18

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 2:28 o'clock p.m., the case in the

20

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
