ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESO.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REYNOLDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

10

Court, this case looks to the Thirteenth Amendment and its

11

implementing legislation, Drincipaliy Section 1584, Title XVIII

12

of the U.S. Code, which makes it a crime for any person to

13

knowingly and wilfully hold another to involuntary servitude.

14

At issue are the sorts of conduct the term "involuntarv

15

servitude" can properly reach.

16

Is it limited solely to the use of physical or lecral

17

force or the threat thereof, as the Second Circuit has held,

18

or, as the court below concluded, may a defendant also be

19

criminally liable if he uses fraud and deceipt to hold another

20

against his or her will, at least as to certain classes of

21

individuals, minors, immigrants, or mentally incompetent, or

22

as we maintain and as the Ninth Circuit has held, may other

23

forms of coercion also lead to criminal culpability i* such

24

behavior was intended to compel another to work against his or

25

her will and did in fact have that result?

The actual backdrop in this case for deciding the

issue is briefly the following.

Ann Arbor,

in the early 1970s, a second man, Lewis Molitoris, was brought

to the farm to work.

9

ages of seven and ten years of age.

10

from 3;00 o'clock in the morning until 8:30 or 9:00 o'clock

did so.

Both men -g
QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, do you think the qovernment

6

could win at trial without a broad definition of this

7

statute and without the use of psychological testimony?

8

It sounded to me when I read the description in the

9

briefs of the case that with evidence of physical beatincrs

10

and threats of commitment that the government didn't need a

11

broad interpretation of the statute here, in this case.

12

MR. REYNOLDS:

Justice O'Connor, I think that we

13

certainly feel that we could prevail in this case without

14

the psycholoaical testimonv.

15

a serious question in this case that would attach if we were

16

to follow the Sixth Circuit's standard because it does not

17

go beyond physical coercion unless vou —

However, I think that there is

QUESTION: Well, one thing that is a concern, of
course, is that these are criminal statutes.

20

MR. REYNOLDS:

21

QUESTION:

Right.

And presumably we have a rule of lenity,

22

and the concern that one has in interpreting it broadly is,

23

what do you do about services performed by someone because of

24

the attraction of a loved one or the charisma of a spiritual

25

or a political leader, or for example an adult child who may

work for years taking care of an invalid parent out of fear

2

that they will be cut off without an inheritance if they

3

don't?

4

Are all these criminal offenses?

I mean, how do you take care of all those things?

MR. REYNOLDS:

difficulty that the lower courts wrestle with.

QUESTION:

10

MR. REYNOLDS:

The statute

Do we know what servitude is?
I think that servitude is, as I

11

understand the elements of that statute, it would include

12

that a person is made to work for a defendant, to provide

13

services for that defendant acrainst his will, . that that

14

defendant has to specifically —

Well, the against the will component

would seem to me to go to what is involuntary.

wondered what servitude was.-

18

MR. REYNOLDS:

services for the defendant who is exerting the coercion.

QUESTION:

youngster.

Well, I used to have to do that as a

Now, I suppose I was in servitude?
MR. REYNOLDS:

4

Well, first the definition of

5

servitude under the Thirteenth Amendment is one that has been

6

traditionally recognized and was at the time to exclude

7

certain relationships, such as the parent-child relationship.

8

I think that beyond that, though, what you have to look to is

9

why, what the conditions are, the elemnets are for the

10

performing of the servitude.

11

It is one that is brought about by reason of the fact that the

12

defendant has, through certain conduct, intentionallv caused

13

the result of having a victim provide the services against

14

his will, and I think there are three elements there that are

15

essential.

This is involuntarv servitude.

You have to show that the person is made to work

16
17

against his will.

18

specifically intended by the defendant.

19

that the defendant's conduct actually caused

21

then you don't have the necessary evidence for --

22

You have to show that that was
And you have to show
the intended

And unless you have all three of those elements,

QUESTION:

Well, what about the adult child who

23

doesn't want to have to take care of an invalid parent but

24

feels compelled to do so?

25

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, I think that again you have got

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S*4MS

7

1

to have -- that would address the state of mind of the person

2

who was providing the services. That does not suggest that

3

there is somebody who is exerting the kind of influence or

4

manipulation over that person to make them work against their

5

will, nor do you! have the causal link.

6

QUESTION:

But you would acknowledge there could be

7

facts that would fit within it if ’"he parent indeed was

8

exerting some kind of psychological pressure on the offspring

9

to make them do it.

10

MR. REYNOLDS:

I think that there has to be -- I am

11

not sure pyschological pressure alone would work.

12

saying, can you posit a situation where a parent would engage

13

in coercive conduct of an overbearing nature with the intent

14

of forcing the child to perform certain services that the

15

child felt compelled to do and would otherwise not do, and

16

that that conduct caused that result to come about, that would

17

fall into the realm, it seems to me, of the kind of evidentiary

18

picture that would have to

19

of mind of both of the participants and the causal link that

20

is necessary.

If you are

Mr. Reynolds, do you acrree with the

instruction that the District Court gave?
MR. REYNOLDS:

25

are acceptable.

QUE S'11 TON:

So you don't think a new trial was

necessary, that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed.

3

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, there is another element of

4

the case that went to the testimony of — psychological

S

testimony that we did not bring to the Court that was thrown

6

out by the court below, which is why you would have to have

7

a new trial.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I thought they ordered a.new trial

because the District Court's definition was too broad.

10

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, they did.

I'm sorry, I mis­

11

understood your question.

12

definition was too broad, that you had to limit the scope of

13

the' conduct reachable here to physical coercion.

correct.

Mr. Reynolds, let's get back to Justice

MR. REYNOLDS:

I would not think that that would be

servitude for purposes —

5

QUESTION:

Why not?

6

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, I don't think that that is what

7

the statute contemplates as requiring that a specific service

be provided by the individuals who are hazed.

QUESTION:

10

MR. REYNOLDS:

11

Well, supposing you are —■
That is a membership requirement to

get into a fraternity.

MR. REYNOLDS: Well, I think that — oh, I see what

that there is no such thing as, if you take it literally,

MR. REYNOLDS:

1

I think, for example, that you could

2

hypothesize a case involving hypnosis, where somebody was

3

hypnotized and told when they woke up they were going to

4

have the kind of conditions of these two men here and perform

5

whatever tasks they were asked to perform and would indeed be

6

in servitude involuntarily by reason of hypnosis.

7

to me that would be a situation not involving physical coercion

8

or legal

9

servitude condition, so I think it is the case that you can

10

have an involuntary situation.

It seems

coercion that clearly is reached by the involuntary

More likely than not what you are going to be

11
12

wrestling with under involuntary is whether indeed the

13

situation is so intolerable as to leave you no viable choice

14

but to do the work. Now, in this case, for example -QUESTION:

15

What do you mean, so intolerable?

Surely

16

that depends on the individual.

17

particular religious cult, depriving me of the love of the

18

leader of that cult is the worst thing in the world that

19

could happen to me.

I mean, that is intolerable to me.

MR. REYNOLDS:

If I am an adherent of a

Well, and that goes to one of the

21

elements of the offense, which is -the state of the mind of the

victim.

That could

qualify.
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think there are situations that

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) «2S-4M0

12

1

could, qualify, for example, where a reliqious -— in a religious

2

situation where the leader of the cult believed that beating

3

of children or adults was the reflex response to ensure that

4

they would indeed adhere to him and his edicts, that that

S

could indeed get to the point of being, and kept them, kept

6

people basically in that kind of condition --

7

QUESTION:

What about depriving me of my father's

8

love?

9

love my father, and he says, you know, son, I want you to work

10

in my business, and I say, Dad, this is really not what I like

11

to do, but for you, for you I will do it, and it is the most

12

important thing in the world to me.

I am no longer a minor.

13

I am an adult.

But I truly

MR. REYNOLDS: There again, I think that you are

14

addressing only one feature of the element of the crime.

15

your father is making demands of that sort with the intent of

16

keeping you there against your will knowing it will have

17

that and that his particular conduct causes that to happen,

18

and indeed you have been left with no viable alternative,

19

then I think that you would have to — that would raise a

20

question.

QUESTION:

If

I think you are going to destroy a lot

of family businesses in this country.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Well,

I think that the -- again, I

24

am not sure that that -- I don't think that that does follow,

25

because I think what that suggests is that the specific

intent factor that is necessary in the criminal case, and

2

the intent factor for the state of mind of the victim are a

I can't imagine a prosecutor,

statute, the prosecutors have rarely — this statute has been

13

used rarely by prosecutors, I think 19 times since '77, and

14

most of those are in connection with the migrant worker kind

15

of a context, where you have individuals brought over as

16

migrant workers, and then basically detained on the farm and

17

not allowed to go and not paid wages.

18

I think that certainly the history of this

Mr. Reynolds, can I interrupt you and go

back a minute to your discussion of servitude?

20

think that the statutory defihition would have been met in

this case if these people had been paid the minimum wage and

22

overtime for their extra hours and had lived in a clean

voluntariness is the same.

Fqually involuntary.

I don't think so.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 62S-4M9

I think those are

14

1

factors that are in the mix that you have to consider, but

2

I think that if you take those two factors out and you still

3

have the physical abuse and the verbal abuse and you still

4

have the threat of institutionalization, and you still have

5

the isolation that you would have a situation in this circu-

6

stance, it seems to me, where you would still have the case,

7

and —

QUESTION:

You

think it would still be servitude

you have here.

15

1

what it is -- what the pressures are on the other side that

2

are being exerted by the defendant to compel them to stay.

3

That again goes to the looking at the coercive conduct.

4

think the mistake that was made by the Sixth Circuit here is

5

that it said the only thing you could look to is'physical

6

coercion, and that that was all that as an evidentiary matter

7

was allowed to be introduced to the jury in terms of deter-

8

mining whether you had the conditon that was condemned, which

is the condition of involuntary servitude.

I think that if you -- well, if

legal coercion in the same sense that is understood by that

somebody to pay off a debt that they do owe.
QUESTION:

not accept the same definition in this case as you would in

claims that he was forced to do something, and the government

always takes a very strict line there.

only if there is no reasonable means of escaping imminent

MR. REYNOLDS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. REYNOLDS:

On the side of the victim?

Yes.
Well, more — it is not very far

18

from that, but it is —- what we are arguing here is that it

19

has to be — that the victim has no tolerable choice, that

20

effectively choice has been removed to do anything but what

21

he is being compelled to do, that on the — either that he

22

has lacked — has a lack of capacity to make any choice, and

23

that is one of the features that is at play in this case,

24

given the mental retardation of these individuals

25

QUESTION:

That is just a subjective component.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(207) &20.AUO

17

1

There is no obiective component as well, that-a reasonable

2

person would have to believe he or she had no choice?

3

MR. REYNOLDS:

No, I don't think so.

I think that

4

MR. REYNOLDS: Well, I think that that is not

unusual, though, in criminal law.

I mean, look at a crime

of kidnapping or extortion, rape.

You have the same kind of

situation, and the courts are called upon all the time to

assess the subjective intent of in those instances both the

7

8

of the perpetrator of the crime.

9

to the criminal law or to juries, I think.
QUESTION:

10

That is not a task unfamiliar

But with kidnapping and other crimes

11

you have objective factors that have to be present as well as

12

the intent, and here there seems to be quite a dearth of

objective factors. You know, you have to hold someone against

QUESTION:

Yes, but what you are talking about in a

typical kidnapping statute is a physical restraint, and here

than a physical restraint.

MR. REYNOLDS:

to me that the element that the jury has to determine is the

protects against the kind of a hypothetical that Justice

Scalia offered.

All it proves is that the test can't be

What is the choice that forces you to

MR. REYNOLDS:

I guess at one level one could say

that, although taking this case, where you have two individuals

who view the world in the same eyes as children of age seven

10

which the authoritative figure instructs them to do, add to

11

that all of the other indicia of coercion that are in this

12

case, and it seems to me that it is easy to conclude that here

13

these individuals believed that they had no other choice than

14

to stay in the circumstances they were in, and that that was

15

what kept them there, notwithstanding the kind of living

16

conditions that Justice White mentioned.

sticks around because the person wants to keep him and will

pay him?

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, I think that that is a

distinction, though, that is important.

It doens't seem to

me that we are talking here about societal conditions that

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT-

MR. ZIEMBA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, I should like to call the Court's attention first

8

to the fact that the lower courts reversed the convictions

amorphous.

4

for the government to decide what conduct is improper, leading

to a condition of which the government disapproves. This is

6

what the Solicitor General states on Page 30 of his brief.

"A person may be held to involuntary servitude by being

MR. ZIEMBA:

The instruction should be as defined

by the Sixth Circuit. It should encompass the following

definition.

5

servitude occurs when, A, the servant believes that he or

6

she has no viable alternative but to perform service for the

master, B, because of, 1, the master's use or threatened use

8

of physical force, or 2, the master's use or threatened use

of state-imposed legal coercion, for example, peonage, or

10

3, the master's use of fraud or deceipt to obtain or maintain

services where the servant is a minor, an immigrant, or one

who is mentally incompetent."

"We conclude that a holding to involuntary

Now, that definition in my opinion, I respectfully

who have a message such as Jesus Christ and Mohammed and Moses

to follow in their steps and in their example, and who devote

their lives to the word given by these charismatic reliaious

leaders might be charged under the broad definition of, say,

therefore we must conclude that there was some conduct on the

part of the master, some psychological coercion which deprived

You see, if the definition advocated

by the Solicitor General is adopted by this Court and this

case is tried according to that definition, then — and if

definition of involuntary servitude which will embrace this

be left at sea without chart or compass to auide them in making

a determination whether or not the master, the defendants

capacity and the knowledge to subject somebody to psychological

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Ziemba, if you take the Sixth

Circuit's definition instead, the rather strictly defined

definition, would it not be true that all the evidence about

10

the conditions under which these men lived would be totally

11

irrelevant and probably inadmissible?
MR. ZIEMBA:

I don't think that they would be

totally irrelevant and inadmissible.

Mr. Ziemba, you really think you couldn't

to introduce it, because nobody who has not been threatened
