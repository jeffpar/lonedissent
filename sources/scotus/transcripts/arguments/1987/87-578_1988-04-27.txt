MR. NESLAND:

12

Your Honor, I might answer it this way and say

13

the Court of Appeals in the majority opinion held that we had not

15

and the Court denied certiorari on the issue that that Court of

The problem you have in the grand jury context is that the

So they were challenging -- they were trying to defend their

very misconduct on the fact that you can't establish prejudice in

5

the grand jury level.

What did they suggest prejudice might be?

It seems to me, Justice Scalia, that the issue

11

is whether or not a Court below,

13

to be able to deter misconduct that reflects upon the grand jury

This

The general principle in this

Court's harmless error cases is that you don't reverse a criminal

that general principle is applicable to this case.
