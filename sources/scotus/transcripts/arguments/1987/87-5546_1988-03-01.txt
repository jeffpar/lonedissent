ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK STEVENS, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. STEVENS:

6

7

the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether the

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

jury instructions given pursuant to Article 37071(b) of the

10

Texas Code of Criminal Procedure deprive the jury of any

11

procedure for considering and expressing the view that the

12

mitigating evidence in this case called for the sentence of

13

less, than Death.
This is a case involving consideration of mitigating

14
15

circumstances.

This Court has held that mitigating

16

circumstances must be rooted in the evidence; they must concern

17

the character of the record and the circumstances of the

18

offense.

19

I would like to talk a little bit about the

20

circumstances of the offense and the character of the

21

Defendant, because those relate to the mitigating circumstances

22

in this case.

23

It is absolutely undisputed that Mr. Moran was

24

killed; robbed; kidnapped.

25

crime itself, however.

There were no eyewitnesses to the

circumstantial evidence pointed to Donald Franklin.

Primarily

2

it linked him to the car in which he was unquestionably

abducted in; there was evidence linking her as well to his

4

house and to the outside of the house.
So it was circumstantial evidence that pointed to Mr.

6

Franklin.

8

there was no inculpatory statement; there were two eyewitnesses

12

the witnesses; their motive for testifying; and the lighting

14

cross-examined on their

All in all we don't complain of the sufficiency of

15

the evidence; but we concur that it was sufficient to prove his

16

guilt; of intentional murder beyond a reasonable doubt.

17

But we do contend just as clearly that there was some

18

residual doubt; that the facts of this case were not so strong;

19

not so compelling; to remove all doubt whatsoever; and the best

20

evidence of that is the fact that the jury deliberated for four

21

hours and forty-five minutes before reaching its decision.

22

The primary residual doubt concerned identification;

23

that is, was Mr. Franklin in fact the one seen driving the car

24

away from the scene?

25

He was found guilty and the court then went into the

2

presented four reputation witnesses who testified that Mr.

3

Franklin had a bad reputation as a peaceful and law-abiding

4

citizen; they proved that he had twice previously

6

that, in seven years of imprisonment he had had a good

7

disciplinary record.

10

At this point, the jury was retired to deliberate.

8
9

At the punishment phase, they

They had to choose between life and death for Mr. Franklin, and
they looked to instructions from the court.
What they got was two questions, as is typical under

11
12

the Texas Capital Punishment Submission Scheme.

The question

13

asked whether the crime was committed deliberately and with the

14

reasonable expectation that death would occur.
The second question asks whether there was a

15
16

probability that Mr. Franklin would commit acts of criminal

17

violence constitution a continuing threat to society?

18

was nothing at all in these questions that provided for

19

consideration of the mitigating circumstance we just talked

20

about.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STEVENS:

There

Were there four questions?
Two questions, Your Honor.

Two.

23

The Texas scheme permits the submission of three questions in

24

some cases, but two were submitted.

mitigating circumstances to be considered.

MR. STEVENS:

3

Is that a relevant

Have we ever said that it is?
Your Honor, what the Court said in

4

Lockett was it is required that the circumstances be relevant.

5

But it's relevant if it goes to the defendant's character,

6

record, or circumstance of the offense.

7

no more compelling circumstance of the offense than a question

about whether the Defendant is the one who did it?

think it is relevant.

case, where the decision, where the jury has to make that

circumstance of whether he's the one that did it; whether

QUESTION:

That seems to

Wasn't that put in terms of an assumption

for the sake of argument in Lockhart?
MR. STEVENS:

Possibly, Your Honor.

That's the

8

argument the state made; took the majority opinion to adopt

9

that argument, to at least say, and the Court said, that it

10
11

does not wholly vitiate the claimed interest.
And I took the Court to say that there is some

12

interest in residual doubt that accrues to the Defendant in a

13

unitary jury system.

14

it can be beneficial; it's just another way of saying it can be

15

a mitigating circumstance -- an irrelevant mitigating

16

circumstance.

QUESTION:

they were deciding the guilt that they had, they deliberated

AFTERNOON

1

SESSION

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

2

Mr. Stevens, you may resume

3

where you were, if you remember.

Let me ask you a question,

4

perhaps, to get you started this afternoon.
The state's brief here on page 17 says the jury was

5
6

instructed to consider all the evidence introduced at both

7

phases of the trial and answering the special issues.
Now I gather even if that is so it doesn't satisfy

8

9

your requests here.
MR. STEVENS:

10

That is correct, Your Honor, and I

11

don't believe — I do disagree with the state.

12

wasn't explicitly instructed to consider all the evidence in

13

deciding the special issues.

14

The state

That instruction is typically given in Texas, but it

15

was not here.

The closest the state came to that was in the

16

special issues, where the jury was told,

17

evidence beyond a reasonable doubt?”

"Do you find from the

So we think that the instruction was a little bit

18
19

less explicit than the state would have it.

20

satisfy us either, because even if it did, even if that did

21

direct the jury's consideration, there's still that second

22

aspect of the problem with the way the statute was applied in

23

this case.

24
25

And it would not

It doesn't give the jury a vehicle for answering the
question honestly, "no."

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

I think the only charge on punishment was

in the appendix on page 13?

3

MR. STEVENS:

4

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But the record doesn't indicate — the

5

record, not just the appendix, but the record, apparently, does

6

not incorporate the charges on the guilt phase?
MR. STEVENS:

7

I do believe that the jury was

8

instructed to consider all the evidence — excuse me, to

9

consider the instructions for the previous part of the trial.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. STEVENS:

And I would like to emphasize that we

12

rely on lockett as our principal authority, but Lockett was a

13

statutory case.

We're not seeking to invalidate the Texas statute on

14
15

It invalidated a statute on its face.

its face.
QUESTION:

16

But Lockett, of course, didn't deal with

17

instructions; it just dealt with the admissibility of evidence,

18

as I read the opinion.

19

MR. STEVENS:

I don't know just the admissibility of

20

evidence, Your Honor. I think what the statute -- what the

21

case, said was the statute was so narrow that it didn't allow

22

the jury -- the sentencing judge to consider and to give

23

independent mitigating weight to the relevant mitigating

24

evidence.

25

So I think it's very close to our case.

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It didn't

1

allow consideration; it didn't allow the jury to give

2

independent mitigating weight to the evidence.

3
4
5

But it's not identical to our case because we're not
attacking the statute on its face.
QUESTION:

Ours is a jury instruction.

You're not contending that any evidence

6

that you offered should have been admitted, and wasn't admitted

7

in violation of Lockett, are you?

8

9

MR. STEVENS:

No.

But we did request punishment

instructions, and what those instructions would have done would

10

have permitted the jury to consider all circumstances of the

11

offense and to answer "no" if a circumstance such as residual

12

doubt mitigated against the punishment of Death.

13

complaint with this Texas statute.

14

requested instructions would have broadened the Texas statute;

15

and would have broadened it just like the Texas Court of

16

Criminal Appeals told this Court when it decided Jurek in 1976,

17

this Court's decision in Jurek was based on a promise by the

18

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

19

QUESTION:

That's our

It's too narrow; our

Instruction on the punishment phase just

20

repeated what the Court said at the guilt stage -- or you

21

wouldn't be here, I take it?

22

MR. STEVENS:

Consider all the evidence?

We would be here, Your Honor, because

23

again, our problem is that, even if the jury could have

24

considered all the evidence, there was no procedural vehicle

25

for that jury to give effect to its consideration.

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

In other

1

words, the jury was still bound by its oath to answer the

2

questions truthfully based on the evidence; so if all the judge

3

had done was instruct the jury that it must consider all the

4

evidence, it still would have had no way to answer the

5

questions "no."

6

Assuming it found the answers should be "yes."

Yes,

7

deliberately; yes, probability but still found a mitigating

8

factor, it would have no way to give independent weight to that

9

mitigating factor; and no way to answer the question, "no,"

10
11

12

outside the narrow special issues.
QUESTION:

Now, did you ask for a broader instruction

than you got?

13

MR. STEVENS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEVENS:

We did, Your Honor.

And in what respect was it broader?
It was broader in respect that it tried

16

to bring the statute as applied in this case into compliance

17

with Lockett.

18

instructions three, four and five, told the jury that they

19

could, that they may consider evidence concerning Defendant's

20

character; record; or circumstance of the offense which, in

21

their opinion mitigates against the punishment of Death; and if

22

they find that it does mitigate against the punishment of

23

Death, they can answer the questions "no."

There were two sorts of instructions:

24

The first requested instruction was a little bit

25

different than that; what it told the jury was that it may

13

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

consider evidence of character; record; and circumstance of the

2

offense and, if that evidence leads the jury to have a

3

reasonable doubt about the true answer to the special issues,

4

then it should answer that question, "no."
So what we tried to do with our requested instruction

5
6

was basically ask the jury in every conceivable way the very

7

questions that we think Lockett entitled us to.
QUESTION:

8

Mr. Stevens, what besides the residual

9

doubt, which you say couldn't have come to special issue No.2,

10

what else couldn't have come into the special issue questions?
MR. STEVENS:

11

Under the facts of this case, Your

12

Honor, I'd like to frame the question a little bit differently

13

if I could.

14

related to Mr. Franklin's seven years of good behavior in

15

prison.

16

Our second mitigating factor, however, was

It's not true and we don't contend the jury was

17

precluded from considering that altogether, because clearly his

18

prior prison record was relevant to the second special issue;

19

that is, whether he would probably commit acts of violence in

20

the future.

21

But Lockett I think requires more than just

22

consideration.

23

other words, the jury must individually consider any aspect of

24

character; record; or circumstance of the offense proffered as

25

a basis of a sentence less than Death.

It requires a certain sort of consideration; in

14

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

Individual consideration, and furthermore, it must

1
2

be allowed by the instructions and by the statute, to give

3

independent mitigating weight to that evidence.

4

So, although the jury considered it, we don't doubt

5

that they did consider his prior prison record when answering

6

special issue No.2, there was no vehicle for the jury to give

7

independent mitigating weight to that evidence.
QUESTION:

8
9

Surely the state is entitled to specify

the purposes for which you have to consider it.

Unless you

10

know the purposes for which you can consider it, you really

11

have no basis for knowing what is relevant, mitigating

12

evidence; and what isn't relevant, mitigating evidence, can

13

you?

14

MR. STEVENS:

But the fact that the state may or may

15

not be able to specify the purposes; but I certainly don't

16

think they can specify the purposes to the extent that they

17

preclude giving independent weight to relevant, mitigating

18

factors.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I'm perhaps with you on that, but

20

you allow that everything except the residual doubt element

21

could have come in on one of the special issues.

22
23

MR. STEVENS:

It could have come in for limited

consideration.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. STEVENS:

For limited consideration.
Only for the purpose of probability.

15

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

What the state is doing; what the state is asking

2

this Court effectively to say, that that's the only criteria

3

necessary to decide whether a person lives or dies.
Undoubtedly this Court has previously held that

4
5

that's one criterion, but that can't be the only one.

6

the law of Texas, however.

That is

If the jury -- whatever independent weight they want

7
8

to give to the evidence, they can't do it under the Texas

9

statute.

10

They have to filter it all through special issue

No. 2 .
QUESTION:

11

Still, except for the residual doubt

12

element, you must acknowledge what has happened here is at

13

least within the language of our earlier cases; that the jury

14

could, except for residual doubt, could have taken into account

15

all of the mitigating elements you are concerned about with one

16

exception?

17

MR. STEVENS:

The cases are a little bit confusing to

18

me.

19

other cases say the jury must consider it.

20

Because some cases say the jury could consider it; and

I believe that Eddings and Lockhart make clear that

21

the jury must consider; the jury must listen.

22

what weight the jury has to give to that evidence, but they

23

must listen.

24
25

QUESTION:

It doesn't say

Okay, but that's still technically whether

it's "must" or "may," it would still technically come within

Heritage

16
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that.

2

The jury must consider it only -- they must consider it for

3

this limited purpose in determining whether there ia a

4

probability or not.

5
6
7

The jury must consider it only within that language.

MR. STEVENS:

It gets back to what I said earlier

about consideration versus proper consideration.
QUESTION:

I understand.

You may be right about

8

that, but there's nothing in the language of earlier cases that

9

lays down that requirement, at least.

10

MR. STEVENS:

I do think there is in Lockett.

I

11

think that Lockett told us how that consideration has to be;

12

you have to consider any relevant aspect; mitigating aspect;

13

and we have to give it independent mitigating weight.

14

So, just consideration, consideration as a

15

conglomerate as Texas requires it, the conglomerate being

16

probability, is not enough.

17

that evidence independent mitigating weight.

18

QUESTION:

The jury must be allowed to give

I thought that meant just independent from

19

all other mitigating factors, where you interpret it to mean

20

what unrelated to any specific showing.

21

MR. STEVENS:

I think it means independent of any

22

factors mitigating or aggravating, and in this case, in Mr.

23

Franklin's case, when it was shown that he had committed two

24

prior rapes; when it was shown that he had a bad reputation;

25

that was an aggravating factor as far as probability of future

17

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

dangerousness goes.
I think that it was unconstitutional in this case for

2
3

a jury to have to consider that aggravating evidence in

4

conjunction with this mitigating evidence in sort of lump sum,

5

without considering them independently.

6

Lockett.
QUESTION:

7
8

I think that violates

Well, is your premise, then, that Lockett

undercuts Jurek?
MR. STEVENS:

9

Not necessarily.

We're not asking a

10

court to overrule Jurek in this case.

What Jurek said was the

11

Texas statute properly narrows a category of persons eligible

12

for the Death penalty.

We have no guarrel with that.

It also says that, if we believe the Texas Court of

13
14

Criminal Appeals, then it also provides for consideration of

15

particularized mitigating circumstances.
In those cases in which the Texas statute allows for

16
17

consideration in a particularized mitigating circumstance, we

18

have no complaint.

19

consideration of particularized mitigating circumstances,

20

giving independent weight to those independent circumstances,

21

was not allowed under the facts of the case, because of the

22

narrow special issues.
QUESTION:

23

We're here because in our case,

Well, Jurek was a facial attack on it,

24

though.

Wasn't our pronouncement much more facial in Jurek?

25

Didn't we say this Texas statute is okay?

Proffitt and the Hitchcock case is a good example of

a recent case out of this Court.

When the Court decided

Hitchcock, it didn't overrule Proffitt.

hold that the statute was applied unconstitutionally in that

case.
That's exactly what we're asking in this case.

precluded from considering mitigating circumstances in this

case; and as applied, the statute worke.d unconstitutionally.
QUESTION:

Well, there is this difference.

Hitchcock

said, as applied, it didn't work out right because of something

apart from what the statute itself says.
Where here, you're arguing that the reason this

didn't work as applied was because the language of the statute

doesn't let it work as applied.

So Jurek is still good law as far as it goes.

7

Jurek, though, is important to remember that Jurek

8

was based on a promise by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

9

The court recognized that the statute was facially narrow.

10

order to uphold the constitutionality of the statute on its

11

face, the Court looked to advice and guidance from the Texas

12

Court of Appeals in Jurek v. State, the Texas case; and was

assured by that case that the Court would consider all

Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM C. ZAPALAC, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ZAPALAC:

5
6

We

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

In this case Franklin contends that the Texas capital

8

sentencing statute fails to allow for individualized sentencing

9

because it does not provide for instructions to the jury on how

10

to consider mitigating evidence in their deliberations during

11

the punishment phase of the trial.

12

He relies heavily on the fact that during his

13

particular trial the jury was precluded from considering any

14

residual doubt that it might have had as to Franklin's guild in

15

answering the special issues.

16

First of all, as the Court has already expressed,

17

there has never been any constitutional requirement that the

18

jury take into account residual doubt in determining the

19

punishment that is to be meted out to a capital defendant.

20

Secondly, this is not one of the factors that the

21

jury is to be taking into consideration in making its

22

punishment decision.

23

relevant mitigating factors that are to be taken into account

24

during the punishment phase concern the circumstance of the

25

offense and the character and record of the individual

This Court has explicitly said that the

25

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

defendant before the Court.
The Court has further said that the jury is to be

2
3

concerned with the personal culpability of the individual

4

Defendant, and of the aspects of his character which show

5

whether he can be rehabilitated or whether he is going to

6

continue to be a threat to society.

7

We would contend that residual doubt is simply any

8

residual doubt that the jury might entertain is simply not a

9

circumstance of the offense; is not relevant mitigating

10

evidence; that the jury is required to consider in its

11

punishment deliberations.
But even if it were required to take into account

12
13

this type of evidence, we would contend that both of the first

14

two Texas special issues which are submitted in every capital

15

murder case, do allow for the consideration of the residual

16

doubt that the jury might entertain.
The jury is first of all asked to determine whether

17
18

the conduct of the defendant, in committing the offense, was

19

committed deliberately and with a reasonable expectation that

20

the death of the deceased or another would result.
Second, the jury is required to determine whether

21
22

there is a probability that the defendant will commit future

23

acts of violence that will constitute a continuing threat to

24

society.

25

This Court recognized in Adams v. Texas that jurors

26

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

V

1

faced with the possibility of imposing the Death penalty are

2

going to be — may well be affected by that very awesome

3

burden; and that they may approach their deliberations with a

4

great deal of care and thought.

5

And what this means is they may give greater weight

6

to the evidence that's put before them; and that they may raise

7

their standards as to what constitutes reasonable doubt, so

8

that any doubt that they might have as to the defendant's

9

culpability can be taken into account in the punishment

10
11
12

deliberations.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about the second

statutory question --

13

MR. ZAPALAC:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— that asks if he would commit criminal

15

acts that would constitute a continuing threat to society.

16

what, if he's not put to death, or if he were loose in society?

17

Has the Texas court ever answered that question?

18
19
20

MR. ZAPALAC:

If

The question simply asks, if he is

allowed to live —
QUESTION:

It's if he's allowed to live, not if --

21

the words "continuing threat to society" made me wonder if it

22

was intended to mean if he were turned loose in society?

23

MR. ZAPALAC:

The court, to my knowledge, has never

24

restricted society to free society as opposed to, for example,

25

being confined in prison.

27

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

So that the predicate is,

"if not put to

death," he would do those things?

3

MR. ZAPALAC:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ZAPALAC:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Okay.
The state's position is, then, that any

6

juror who has any residual doubts about the actual guilt of the

7

defendant is not sufficient to rise to the level of a

8

reasonable doubt as to his guilt, still can find expression for

9

those concerns in the Texas special issues to determine that,

10

by giving additional weight to the evidence of deliberateness,

11

as was brought out in Franklin's case, the jury would be able

12

to return a "no" answer on that special issue.
Franklin's case is a good example of this:

13

if any

14

juror had any doubt about the actual guilt of the defendant,

15

the evidence that was presented, and the argument that was made

16

with respect to the first special issue, the deliberateness

17

issue, could have given the juror -- that juror, a means of

18

expressing his residual doubt; and the ability to answer the

19

question,

20

"no."
Franklin argued that the facts of this offense

21

demonstrated that he had not given careful thought, had not

22

engaged in the kind of reflection when he committed the crime,

23

but it was, in his words, a "crime of passion," simply an

24

instinctive reaction to the fact that his victim was beginning

25

to show opposition to his attempt to kidnap and rob.

QUESTION:

1

Well counsel, suppose that the

2

instruction here were,

"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you

3

can consider the mitigating evidence only with reference t.o

4

question Nos.1 and 2."

5

MR. ZAPALAC:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ZAPALAC:

If those were the --

Valid?
— those were the only issues

8

presented, and those were the concerns that the jury is to be

9

taking into account in its sentencing decision.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Can the Court give that instruction in

every case?
MR. ZAPALAC:

The instructions that the courts

13

typically give are that you are to consider all of the evidence

14

in answering the special issues.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but I'm asking if you could give the

16

instruction that I proposed?

17

MR. ZAPALAC:

18

QUESTION:

That the --

And may consider all of the mitigating

19

circumstances; all of the evidence that's been presented to

20

you; but only in order to answer question Nos.1 and 2, and for

21

no other purpose.

22

MR. ZAPALAC:

That would be permissible, because our

23

position is that all relevant mitigating evidence; all the

24

evidence that goes to determine the individual culpability of

25

this particular Defendant, and the evidence that goes to

Heritage

29
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

determine whether he can be rehabilitated, whether he's going

2

to continue to be a threat to society, or whether there is a

3

possibility of treating him or at least restraining him in such

4

a way that he does not continue to be a threat, is covered in

5

these two special issues, so that any relevant mitigating

6

evidence that would be presented by the defendant, can be

7

considered within the two special issues, and the jury could

8

properly be limited to consideration of the evidence within

9

those special issues.
QUESTION:

10

May I follow up on that?

Suppose the

11

mitigating circumstance was different than the one relied on

12

here, and instead the Defendant's counsel argued that he was

13

only 16 or 17 years old at the time of the offense and for that

14

reason he should not be put to death; that that is a mitigating

15

circumstance that should be given independent consideration;

16

and the prosecutor argued,

17

answering question No.2 as to the probability of future harm,

18

and if you are convinced that he is -- that there is a risk of

19

future violence or future criminal threat to society, you must

20

nevertheless answer the question in that way, and the judge so-

21

instructed .
That would be proper, I gather, under the Texas

22

23
24
25

"You can only consider it in

system?
MR. ZAPALAC:

I'm not sure that it would be proper to

say that the evidence can be limited only to the second special

issue.

2

QUESTION:

Or the first or the second.

3

MR. ZAPALAC:

Be limited to the first or the second

4

special issue.

5

defendant produces is that he is 16 or 17 -- under Texas law

6

he'd have to be at least 17 years old at the time of the

7

offense —
QUESTION:

8

9

In that case, if the only evidence that the

Or say he was 18, and he said a man of 18

shouldn't be — he wanted to argue that?
MR. ZAPALAC:

10

If the only thing that the defendant

11

does is introduce the fact that his age at the time of his

12

offense, certainly that can be considered in mitigation in the

13

jury.

14

QUESTION:

But how could it if the judge gave the

15

instruction that Justice Kennedy proposed:

16

18 is only relevant to the question whether he would constitute

17

a continuing threat to society -- you may not weigh it for any

18

other purpose?

19
20

MR. ZAPALAC:

the fact that he's

Or that he did not have the maturity to

act with the kind of deliberateness --

21

QUESTION:

Correct.

22

MR. ZAPALAC:

-- that we would ascribe to people that

23

we think deserve the Death penalty.

24

simply introduces the fact of his age, I think that jurors are

25

aware that young people, as this Court has pointed out, for

Heritage

Again, if the defendant

31
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

example, in Eddinqs, younger people do not have the same

2

maturity in adults and are not held necessarily to the same

3

standard.

4

And the jury can be aware of this; the jury can look

5

at that evidence and determine whether this particular

6

defendant acted deliberately; acted with the kind of

7

culpability that would justify the imposition of the Death

8

penalty; or whether this Defendant has the capacity has the

9

capacity to be rehabilitated.

10

But the defendant also bears the responsibility, if

11

he wants the jury to give additional weight to all this

12

evidence, then it's incumbent upon him to come in and explain

13

to the jury, as Franklin did not in this case about the

14

evidence about his adjustment to prison life; explain to the

15

jury why this evidence is relevant to the considerations that

16

the jury would engage in; why this evidence is particularly

17

relevant to these special issues?

18

The point is that there could be that there is

19

medical evidence or psychiatric testimony that could be

20

developed that shows that this particular individual did not

21

have the maturity, the capability, of committing the act with

22

the kind of deliberateness that's necessary for the imposition

23

of capital punishment.

24
25

QUESTION:

But the assertion here is that you may

come up with, and the assertion is that there was in this case

32

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

an element of mitigation that was mitigating not because it

2

went to one of these two factors but for some other reason,

3

such as in particular the fact that he had been well-behaved

4

the last time he was in prison, which could go to whether he

5

would be dangerous in the future (issue No.2) or it could also

6

go to the question whether he was basically a pretty good

7

person; a person of good character.

8

any event.
Now, why can't a jury just consider that as

9
10

That's the assertion in

mitigating because it showed he wasn't such a bad person?
MR. ZAPALAC:

11

Because this is an aspect of his

12

character that is a relevant consideration that the jury needs

13

to take into account.

14

did not argue this part of his character as a mitigating

15

factor.

16

danger to anyone; he's demonstrated in the past that he's not

QUESTION:

21

I know it is.

I'm asking why it should

You're not addressing the argument that he's made, which

23

is that the two special factors unduly limit the jury's ability

24

2

3

someone not basically of good character, shouldn't be executed.

4

And I can't do that under these two charges.

5

Maybe, I think a person of good, basically good

MR. ZAPALAC:

This Court has said that the relevant

6

concerns that the jury must take into account and must be

7

looking at are the individual culpability of the defendant what

8

comes before it; and the aspects of that defendant's character

9

that demonstrate, for example, whether he is going to be

10
11

capable of being rehabilitated.
And we would say that if that evidence of the

12

individual's character shows that he can be rehabilitated, or

13

at least show that he's not going to be a danger as long as

14

he's confined in prison, that that is certainly relevant

15

mitigating evidence, and that the Texas statute allows for

16

consideration of that evidence.

17

QUESTION:

In this case —

18

QUESTION:

I think that you also suggested the jury

19

said that the only consideration that the Texas statute, even

20

in its limited considerations, those three questions, is

21

constitutional.

22

considerations?

23

And that Texas need not add any independent

MR. ZAPALAC:

That's correct, because as this Court

24

pointed out, the relevant considerations, the concerns, that

25

the jury is to be looking at is the individual culpability of

34

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

.1

this defendant; this is the purpose of individualized

2

sentencing; this is why we want to have the juries engage in

3

individualized sentencing, because we want to look at the

4

culpability of this particular Defendant to determine his, for

5

example, his degree of participation in the offense; his degree

6

of the culpability that he bears for the very type of crime

7

that he committed; whether it was a particularly savage and

8

brutal crime; whether there were perhaps mitigating aspects

9

even in the circumstances of the offense, in the way that the

10

crime was committed.

11

And also those aspects of the Defendant's character

12

which demonstrate that he is a person who doesn't deserve the

13

Death penalty; that he is a person who can be rehabilitated who

14

is not going to pose a threat to society in the future.

15

And it's these concerns that the Texas special issues

16

address; it's these concerns that the jury's attention is

17

focused on during the punishment phase of the trial.

18

In his brief, Franklin argues that the concepts of

19

"intentional" which is used to define-the culpable mental state

20

for capital murder; and "deliberate" is used in the first

21

special issue, are virtually identical; and therefore, a jury

22

who has convicted a defendant of capital murder is almost bound

23

to return an affirmative answer to the first special issue.

24
25

In fact, this is not the case.

The Court of Appeals

has indicated in the past that the two terms are not linguistic

35

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

equivalents; that the term, "intentional" and the term,

2

"deliberate" are not synonymous; do not mean the same thing;

3

and that juries are able to comprehend this; and in fact,

4

juries are able to comprehend this.
For example, in the Heckert v. State, the defendant

The co-defendant handed Heckart a

10

Heckert saw a movement out of the corner of his eye;

11

recognized that it was not his accomplice, who had gone off in

12

a different direction; turned, fired two shots and killed the

13

victim.

14

The jury had no trouble determining -- deciding, that

15

this was an intentional act that the defendant intended; that

16

he killed the victim at the time he fired the shots; but

17

returned a "no" answer on the first special issue, saying that

18

there was no deliberation; there was no volition; no choosing

19

to engage in this kind of conduct.

20

Jurors can perceive the difference between the two.

21

The issue is also particularly relevant in

22

determining the actual culpability of the — defendant in the

23

case of the Law of Parties or Accomplices, where the degree of

24

participation of the actual defendant may be less than having

25

actually committed the murder.

Although guilty of capital

36

1

murder as a party or as an accomplice, the degree of

2

participation was not sufficient that the jury would find that

3

his behavior was deliberate and culpable enough to warrant the

4

Death penalty.
There are numerous cases reported in Texas where the

5
6

Law of Parties has been at issue; the defendant has been

7

convicted under the Law of Parties, but the jury has come back

8

with a "no" answer to the first issue.
Finally, in Franklin's own case, the process of

9
10

arguing that Franklin's actions were not deliberate began with

11

the process of jury selection; and during voir dire, Franklin

12

questioned the — members extensively on their understanding of

13

intentional and deliberate, and their ability to distinguish

14

the two terms.
At least one potential juror was excluded because the

15
16

two terms were indistinguishable in that persons's mind.

17

During the punishment phase of the trial, during his

18

argument, counsel argued at length that all of the facts of the

19

offense showed that this was not a careful, thoughtful,

20

reflective action on the part of Franklin; that it was

21

result simply of a crime of passion; an instinctive reaction to

22

the situation; and was not something that warranted the death

23

penalty.

24
25

a

It was not a deliberate act.
He went through again and read numerous definitions

of the term, "deliberate" and reiterated that these actions did

37

not fall within the terms of deliberate conduct.
QUESTION:

MR. ZAPALAC:

QUESTION:

I think

I would think, if the difference is as

obvious as you say, and you have a juror who can't understand
it, you shouldn't have to waste a preemptory challenge.
MR. ZAPALAC:

he may have been excused for cause, but I don't remember.

8
9

Did he have to use a preemptory

I would think that it would have been

for cause, but I don't recall exactly.
So his argument that the first special issue, in

13
14

actuality, is a nullity and adds nothing to the jury's

15

consideration certainly is not borne out by either the law or

16

the facts of his own particular case.
Finally, with respect to the future danger issue,

17
18

Franklin cannot deny and has not denied that he was able, under

19

the Texas statute, under the procedures employed in this trial,

20

to present all of the relevant mitigating evidence that he

21

wanted to.

22

arguing the relevance of that evidence to the special issues

23

during his jury argument.

24
25

He has not denied that he was limited in any way in

He cannot reasonably claim that the jury could not
seek the relevance of his evidence to the second special issue.

38

Heritage

Corporation

1

The aspect of his character that he wants to give an

2

independent weight was not borne out if the jury did not see

3

this particular evidence; did not see the effects of this

4

evidence on his case; the fault is with Franklin, and he has

5

not shown that a jury instruction to, especially in the form

6

that he has proposed, would have made any difference in the

7

jury's decision; would have added anything to the jury's

8

consideration; would have pinpointed the jury to those aspects

9

of his character that he claims were exemplified by his

10

behavior in prison.

11

QUESTION:

Is it fair to say, counsellor, that with

12

reference to Franklin's requested instructions, he did not seek

13

to add any special issues, but simply to instruct the jury how

14

the special issues were to be answered; and that was done?

15

that your position?

16

MR. ZAPALAC:

Is

He certainly did not attempt to add any

17

special issues.

I don't think that his instructions,

18

particularly added anything to the jury's understanding of how

19

the jury was to proceed with their deliberations.

20

In fact, the jury, although in this case apparently

21

not explicitly instructed to consider all the evidence during

22

voir dire, during the jury argument at the punishment phase of

23

the trial, the jury was told repeatedly that there would be a

24

punishment phase of the trial; you will be able to consider the

25

evidence from both phases of the trial at that time in

39

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

answering the special issues.

2

Both sides argued the facts of the offense from the

3

guilt/innocence phase; as well as the evidence that came out at

4

the punishment phase of the trial.

5

that they were to consider all of the evidence that had been

6

presented at both phases of the trial.

The jury clearly was aware

The jury was also instructed that they were to find

7
8

they were not to answer one of the specials -- either of the

9

special issues in the affirmative, unless they were persuaded

10

beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer should be "yes."
And they were also instructed that the only way that

11
12

they could return a "yes" answer was that if the entire jury,

13

all 12 members, unanimously agreed that the answer should be

14

"yes."

15

the jury system; had the protections of the reasonable doubt

16

standard; and that the Texas special issues allow for the

17

consideration of all the mitigating evidence that he presented.

18

So it's very clear that Franklin had the protections of

QUESTION:

Yes, but couldn't you make the same

19

argument in Lockett,• that all the evidence was received and

20

could have been considered, but just for limited purposes,

21

rather than with respect to the ultimate question?

22

MR. ZAPALAC:

The statute in Ohio really did not

23

allow the jury to consider the evidence that was not directly

24

related to the three specially defined mitigating

25

circumstances.

In this case, Franklin has pointed to no

40

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

1

evidence that either he attempted to introduce or that he would

2

have liked to have introduced; or that he could even think

3

about from any source.
QUESTION:

4

No.

But the instruction would preclude,

5

and Justice Scalia suggested, from thinking that the evidence

6

of seven years of good behavior in prison may not really

7

convince me that he will not engage in violence in the future;

8

but yet if I also find that he went to church every day; or he

9

prayed regularly and he really was contrite about what he did,

10

I don't think the man should die.

11

determination.
MR. ZAPALAC:

12

They couldn't make that

I think that that evidence, I really

13

fail to see that that particular evidence has any kind of

14

relevance to the jury's consideration, other than as it goes to

15

the question whether this particular defendant is going to be a

16

future danger.

Again --

QUESTION:

17

Well, they could believe, you know, he was

18

sincerely repentant and all the rest of it, yet not have a

19

strong enough character to avoid involvement in future criminal

20

activity.

21

So it seems to me that it is at least logically

22

possible for a jury to think that it must answer both questions

23

in the affirmative; but nevertheless feel that this evidence is

24

persuasive on the question whether he should be put to death?

25

MR. ZAPALAC:

I think that that type of evidence

41

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

would also be in the way that you phrased it could also be

2

relevant to the first special issue in whether this particular

3

defendant is capable of actually engaging in the type of

4

behavior that is so personally culpable that the jury would be

5

justified in imposing the death penalty.
So I think that the Texas statute does take into

6
7

account those considerations.

8

argument at the time of his trial, that the jury should look at

9

these aspects of his character; presented no evidence

Again, Franklin did not make the

10

whatsoever that the fact that he had been able to conform his

11

behavior in prison; had been able to adapt his life, made any

12

difference other than the fact that he indicated that he

13

wouldn't be a future danger as long as he was confined to

14

prison.

15

If the Court has no further questions, I think that

16

the state's position is that the Court of Appeals decision

17

should be affirmed.

You can't make -But am I right, counsel, that the only

thing you requested was that the jurors consider those factors

MR. STEVENS:

5

Or am I incorrect?

Two types of instructions:

one,

6

consider the mitigating evidence when deciding the true answer

7

of special issue Nos.1 and 2.

8

The second type of instruction asks the jury to

answer yes or no based on whether or not they thought the

10

evidence mitigated against the penalty of death.

QUESTION:

12

MR. STEVENS:

13

Two — well, three, four and five did

it exclusively; and two was a mixed instruction.
QUESTION:

14
15

Which instruction was that?

But each one of those refers only to the

jury's consideration of questions of special issue Nos.1 and 2.

16

MR. STEVENS:

17

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Your point is it sort of rewrites to -- I

18

mean, it says you can answer No.2 "no' even though the answer

19

is "yes?"

20

MR. STEVENS:

Correct, Your Honor.

The state wants

to fault us for not making an argument that we didn't have --

could have been made effective.

You're talking about No.5 in particular,

your instruction that you may answer special issue No.2 "no" if

Heritage

you find any aspect of the Defendant's character or record or

2

any of the circumstances as factors which mitigate against the

imposition of the Death penalty; which means anything that you

want to mitigate; and if you think it mitigates, then answer

No.2 "no" even though its real answer is "yes."

MR. STEVENS:

That's

That's correct, Your Honor.

So that's

independent of the true answer of the special issues.
I don't understand the prosecutor to say that I

requested instructions and misstated the law; or that they were

erroneous in any way.

12

they are merely redundant.

13

Justice O'Connor has noted in a concurring opinion, when

14

there's any doubt about this, it's the duty of the Court to

remove any ambiguity about whether the jury actually considered

the mitigating evidence.
