ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY PETERSON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PETERSON:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Oklahoma has a statute that grants a defendant in a

10

first degree murder case nine preemptory challenges.
The issue in this case is whether it's constitutional

11
12

for a state to take away one of those preemptory challenges

13

during a capital murder trial.
The way that this issue came up was when the trial

14
15

judge made what everybody now agrees was a very serious

16

mistake.

17

judge overruled a defense challenge for cause against a juror,

18

Mr. Huling, who said that he would return only a death sentence

19

upon conviction and that he would not consider any possible

20

other penalty.

21

During the jury selection in this case, the trial

This juror was plainly unqualified under the Sixth

2.2

Amendment and even the state now concedes that he was

23

unqualified to sit on the trial.

24

But once .the challenge for cause was overruled, there

25

was only one thing to stop this juror from sitting on this case
3
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

and that was if one party or the other removed him by a
preemptory challenge.

1
4

The way that jury selection proceeded in this case
was that the parties used their preemptory challenges in
alternation.

One side would use a challenge, they would bring

6

on a replacement juror, and then the other side would use a

7

challenge.
The first party to come up with a preemptory

8

9

challenge to use, after Mr. Huling was seated, was the state,

10

and what did the state do with its preemptory challenge after
Mr. Huling was seated?
anybody.

13

They waived it. They didn't use it on

They were quite happy to see Mr. Huling sit as a

juror in this case.
The state apparently was not interested in correcting

14

15

with its own preemptory challenges what they now concede to be

16

a rather flagrant error by the trial judge.

17

felt it was the better use of the challenge to just waste it.
QUESTION:

18

They apparently

Do they concede that it was a flagrant

1.9

error?

20

thought that, if I recollect their brief correctly, they do

21

make the argument that there was some ambiguity in that juror's

22

responses, that some of his earlier responses were inconsistent

23

with that statement that you quoted.

24
25

I think they've conceded that it was wrong, but I

MR. PETERSON:

Your Honor, I was relying on the last

oral argument in this case.

Mr. Nance conceded that it would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

violate the Sixth Amendment for this juror to sit.
QUESTION:

Well, but, I understand that, but that's a

">

little different from saying that it was a flagrant violation,

4

so that you can make the statement that the state must have

5

known there was a violation and the state could have solved the

6

problem by using one of its preemptories.

7

MR. PETERSON:

The state conceded it was a Sixth

p

Amendment violation.

n

violation in this case was a flagrant one.

We contend that the Sixth Amendment

QUESTION:

Okay.

i 1

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the state took the

12

position that in view of Oklahoma's procedure of letting a

13

preemptory be used to solve the problem of the failure to

14

excuse the juror that, in fact, there was no error at the end

15

of the line.
I mean, that was what I understood the argument to

16
17

18

be.
MR. PETERSON:

That was their argument, but they did

19

concede that if this juror had sat, it would have violated the

20

Sixth Amendment.

We --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PETERSON:

Well, but the juror didn't sit, of course.
That's correct, but the cost of that

23

to the defense was that it lost one of its nine preemptory

24

challenges.

25

The only way to keep this juror off was for the
5

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

defense to use a preemptory challenge of its own. There was no

n

help coming from the state to correct the error.

i

QUESTION:

Just before we leave the question about

4

the juror, this doesn't come up to us on habeas.

5

findings. There were no findings that a particular juror would

6

have been challenged?
MR. PETERSON:

7

There was no

The defense attorney did not

8

specifically identify any juror that actually sat on the jury

9

whom he would have removed.

10

He did specifically say that he

did not think that the final trial jury was fair and impartial.
QUESTION:

1 1

But he didn't say that as to any

12

particular juror he would have exercised his last preemptory

1

challenge?

14

15
16

MR. PETERSON:

He didn't have any preemptory

challenges left.
QUESTION:

Or that he would have exercised an

17

additional preemptory challenge?

10

MR. PETERSON:

He didn't say as a hypothetical

19

matter, if I had more preemptory challenges, I would use it

20

upon Juror X.

21

if he had made such a statement, it wouldn't have proved

22

anything because the mistake happened earlier in the jury

2

selection and if the mistake hadn't happened, we could have

24

ended up with a different panel of jurors facing him by the end

25

of jury selection.

Of course, it's part of our argument that even

So that it just doesn't prove anything and,
6

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

of course, we're relying on the Gray v. Mississippi case on

o4

that issue.
QUESTION:

3

Well, you are going somewhat beyond that,

4

aren't you?

Aren't you saying that if any juror is wrongfully

5

excluded -- wrongfully included, calling for a preemptory

6

challenge that you have automatically as a lawyer?
MR. PETERSON:

7

Well, I don't think it's necessary to

8

argue that in this case.

Of course, this was a death penalty

g

case, and we would say that in a death penalty case, there

10

should be a very scrupulous adherence to procedures, perhaps

11

more so than in other cases.
QUESTION:

12

Well, suppose the judge just makes an

13

error and seats a juror that he shouldn't, and you use one

14

preemptory challenge extra, automatic reversal?
MR. PETERSON:

15

It would depend on whether the state

16

had a rule that required you to use a preemptory challenge in

17

order to correct the judge's error.

18

there would be no problem.

19

question about whether to remove a juror or not use a challenge

20

and then argue on appeal that the juror shouldn't have been

2 .1

seated.

22

If there was no such rule,

It would just be a tactical

So, I think that the constitutional violation depends

23

on the defendant being forced to use a preemptory challenge to

24

remove somebody, be forced to give up a valuable right as a

25

result of a mistake.

QUESTION:

One reads the Oklahoma Code of Criminal

2

Appeals opinion and one gets the impression that that is one of

3

the purposes of preemptories in Oklahoma, is to correct that

4

sort of thing, that this is not a miscarriage of the preemptory

5

system, but it's one of the things you use it for.

o

G

MR- PETERSON:

We disagree.

I mean, the statutes do

7

not say that.

8

the direct opposite thing. They say preemptory challenges are

9

not to be used until people who are challengeable for cause are

10

In fact, the statutes, Oklahoma statutes, say

removed from the jury.

11

I think the most you can read into the Oklahoma court-

12

decisions is that they have prescribed some kind of procedure

13

for bringing appeals on claims of error based on overruling

14

challenges for cause.

15

preemptory challenge is extinguished if the judge happens to

16

make an error in a case.

17

They haven't said that the right of

In fact, in this case, they seem to say that the

18

right of preemptory challenge -- if the defendant had been able

19

to point to somebody objectionable or in another case, they

20

used the expression unacceptable, that was still on the jury,

21

they would have a grant of relief.

22

So, I don't think they're saying that you just have

23

to sacrifice your preemptory challenges for the cause of

24

justice in Oklahoma. I just don't think that's the law in

25

Oklahoma.

QUESTION:

Well, are you complaining that you had to

use the extra preemptory challenges?
MR. PETERSON:

We are complaining that we had to

4

effectively waste a preemptory challenge by using it to excuse

5

Juror Huling.

6

QUESTION:

But are you complaining that you had to

7

use all of your preemptory challenges in order to make -- bring

8

this appeal?

q

MR- PETERSON:

I think that that puts a very big

10

burden on the assertion of the Sixth Amendment right to an

1.1

impartial jury to have to exercise all of your preemptory

12

challenges and that's one of our arguments on our Sixth

13

Amendment claim, is that the state has prescribed procedures

14

that are so burdensome to enforce the right to an impartial

15

jury, and one of those rights is you have to exhaust all your

16

preemptory challenges even though there may be a tactile reason

17

to save one.

18

QUESTION:

Well, if you had four and you only lost

19

one, and you only had to use one improperly, then you're not

20

hurt if you had three extra ones that you more or less had to

burn, shall we say, simply in order to take an appeal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This loss of a preemptory challenge violated the
Constitution.
The Oklahoma court agreed that Mr. Huling should have
been removed by the trial judge for cause, but they refused to
give any remedy for the loss of the preemptory challenge that
followed from following Oklahoma's procedure. In effect, the
court said that the loss of the preemptory challenge was a
harmless error.

We disagree.

Preemptory challenges are valuable because they
change a jury's membership, and a change in jury's membership
can lead to a change in the outcome of the case, that could
have led to a chance in the outcome of this case.
There was conflicting evidence at the trial of this
case.

For example, on the question of whether the defendant

had the intent to kill.

That was an element of the defense.

There was also conflicting evidence on the sentencing issues.
A different jury could have resolved those conflicts
differently.
This was the kind of case where the defense needed
all nine of its preemptory challenges and not just eight of
them.

So, a change of even one juror brought about by a

I think that that would be grounds for

11

while a change of even one juror could have been

critical,

it's important to note that one preemptory challenge

13

could have made more difference than just one juror on the

14

final jury.

15

parties between them had a total of eight preemptory challenges

16

left and only eight of the actual trial jurors had been seated

at that point.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

if it's clear that it's not a harmless error, yes, in that

case, there should be an automatic reversal.

4

There's been a loss of a very serious right in that
situation, and there's no way to say it's harmless.
The problem with the state's argument about the

defendant really isn't entitled to nine preemptory challenges

7

is unsupported by our statutes.

that.

9

don't put any conditions on it.

The state is wrong when it says that you're entitled to

The state's other argument is that even if the

23

defendant is entitled to nine preemptory challenges, a trial

24

with eight preemptory challenges doesn't deny what they call

25

fundamental fairness.
20

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

The state hasn't been too clear on what -- how you

o

judge what is or isn't fundamentally fair. Certainly it doesn't

.3

seem fair for my client to be getting eight preemptory

4

challenges in his case while other first degree murder

5

defendants in Oklahoma are getting nine.

6

Presumably, the statutes of Oklahoma are some

7

evidence of what the people of Oklahoma speaking through their

0

legislature regard as fundamentally fair, and those statutes

9

say that the fair number is nine, not eight.

QUESTION:

11

MR. PETERSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PETERSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

16

Did the state use its nine?
They used five and waived four.

So, then, it used five and you had eight.
In fact, yes.

Without including the one you had to use

improperly.
MR. PETERSON:

In fact, yes.

Of course, the state

17

had the opportunity to use all nine and that may have

I8

influenced how the defense used theirs.

1.9

But instead of focusing on fundamental fairness, a

20

more appropriate inquiry, we submit, is whether the defendant

21

received the process that he was due under the law.

22

that's what the Fourteenth Amendment says, this Court has said

that the law in due process of law includes state law.

24

like the law in this case, that require nine preemptory

challenges.

Since

Just

The defendant was due nine preemptory challenges

under Oklahoma's law.

is imprisoned and executed as a result of a trial which he

receives only nine -- eight of his nine challenges, the state

has deprived him of his life and his liberty without due

process of law and that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.

7

He only received eight of them.

If he

On the question of harmless error, Chapman v.

California says that proving a constitutional error is harmless

state in this case.

It also says that the burden is proof

beyond a reasonable doubt.

12

We don't have any burden of proof on this issue, but

13

the record gives every indication that the error was, in fact,

1.4

a harmful one and not a harmless one.

15

To establish harmless error, there's no dispute that

if the defendant had had another preemptory challenge, he could

have used it to alter the membership of the jury.

jury's membership.

On the question of whether a different jury would

have decided the case in the same way, this Court's harmless

4

years have never tried to go back and figure out what a

6

different jury would have done in a case, but for a

that if he had had the full use of his nine preemptory

have changed the jury's membership.

his mistake. That would have been futile. Under Oklahoma law,

the judge couldn't increase the number of preemptory challenges

The other thing he didn't do was to say as a

if he had another one available against some juror that

actually sat on the panel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. NANCY, ESQ-

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NANCE:

4

5

Court:
There are three issues presented in this case, and I

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

believe there are three that are not.
The first is whether the circumstances of the removal

8

of potential Juror Huling from the panel by a preemptory
I. 0

challenge rather than by a challenge for cause deprived the

11

Petitioner of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial

12

jury.

13

The second issue that is presented is whether the

14

circumstances of the removal of that potential juror deprived

15

the Petitioner of life or liberty without due process of law.

16

The third

uestion as presented by the Petitioner is

17

if there was a constitutional violation, is that violation

18

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

19

The three issues that I think are not present in this

20

case are that this is not a Witherspoon death-prone jury case.

2 1

This is not a Batson improper-racial exclusion case.

22

is not a case in which there is any demonstrable, articulatable

n >

bias or prejudice on the jury that actually sat.

24
25

And this

As I think is agreed here, trial counsel accepted for
cause each and every juror who sat and made no objection to
25

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

those jurors, but only complained that there were no blacks on

")

the jury and that the Petitioner was, therefore, denied a fair

3

trial by a jury of his peers.

4

I'd like very briefly to summarize why I believe that

5

the circumstances of this case present no constitutional error,

6

and why this Court should affirm the judgment of the Court of

7

Criminal

This Court has stated, and I think it appears

8
9

Appeals.

conceded here, that preemptory challenges in this sort of case

10

are creatures of state law rather than creatures of

1.1

constitutional law.
Some members of this Court over the years have sought

12

13

the complete abolition of preemptory challenges in criminal

14

cases.

15

trial before an impartial and differently-chosen jury and there

16

is no argument whatsoever that the Petitioner in this case did

17

not receive such a trial.

10

The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution reguires a fair

There is no allegation here that the judge's error

19

with regard to Juror Huling or potential Juror Huling affected

20

the impartiality of the jury that actually sat.

21

We believe the Oklahoma statutes in this case do not

nZ Zn

create a substantial and legitimate expectation of influence,

23

direct influence over the deprivation of life or liberty and,

24

therefore, preemptory challenges as a state right are not

25

constitutionalized by the due process clause.
26
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

The longstanding Oklahoma law which requires the use

')

of a preemptory challenge to correct a trial judge's error on a

3

challenge for cause is a reasonable and legitimate state rule

4

which benefits both the petitioner or the criminal defendant

5

and the state.
The error in this case, as we see it, did not affect

6
7

a specific constitutional right and, therefore, we are bound by

R

the narrow due process formula of fundamental fairness and that

q

there was nothing about the procedures in the trial court that

10

was fundamentally unfair.
The trial was fair.

11

?

12

beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Petitioner had competent

13

trial counsel.
QUESTION:

14

You keep emphasizing the trial was fair.

15

Was the refusal to exclude that juror because of his statement,

16

was that fair?

17
1R

20

I'm using your word, fair.

MR. NANCE:

It was an error, Your Honor.

say that it was not fair.
QUESTION:

19

Does an error keep a trial from being

fair?

21

-

Guilt was reliably established

MR. NANCE:

An error may or may not affect the

22

fairness of the whole trial.

I think the trial judge was

23

wrong, but there were inconsistent statements by the particular

24

juror.

25

anything but death.

On two occasions, he said that he would not consider

He never did, Your Honor.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

So, how can I assume that you say what he

said when he didn't say it?
MR. NANCE:

Well, I don't guess you could assume that

I speak for the judge.

8

QUESTION:

I can't accept your reading of his mind.

n

MR. NANCE:

I don't -- I wouldn't pass myself off as

10

reading his mind.

11

said twice that he would only impose death, but he told the

12

prosecutor once and the defense lawyer once that he would

13

consider a life sentence.

14

I could talk about what's in the record.

He

So, he basically kind of said I'll go this way and I

15

think the trial judge was wrong, but he wasn't flagrantly wrong

16

or flagrantly unconstitutional. I wouldn't say that.

17

I think as Justice O'Connor stated, in our view, at

18

the end of it, there was no error because of the availability

19

of a preemptory challenge, and in any event, as the Court has

20

said and as has been conceded, preemptory challenges aren't

21

constitutionally required.

22

In some of the earlier cases, --

23

QUESTION:

24

25

Well, does any state give more preemptory

challenges to the prosecution than to the defense?

MR. NANCE:

aware of any state where the converse happens.
QUESTION:

6

Well, suppose a state gave the prosecution

7

twice as many preemptories as to the defense, violation there?

8

Constitutional problem?
MR. NANCE:

Q

I think there very well could be because

in

that would be, at least in my mind, fundamentally unfair.

u

Unless there was a question in the first argument about

12

empirical evidence that showed jurors leaned to the defense and

13

you had to rebalance it.

14
15

In the absence of something very good along those
lines, I'd say that would make things unfair.

16

I need to take issue, I think, with --

17

QUESTION:

So, a misallocation or a disproportionate

18

grant of preemptory challenges can give rise to a

19

constitutional problem, then it's just a question of degree,

20

correct?
MR. NANCE:

21

QUESTION:

I think so.

I think that's correct.

And here you say that one more preemptory

23

challenge does not rise to the degree of the constitutional

24

violation?

25

MR. NANCE:

That's true.

That's precisely what we

29

Heritage Reporting Corporation

i

say.

I need to take issue, if I may, with the argument

2

that the Petitioner only got eight and the state got nine.
4

The Oklahoma law and the cases cited by the

5

Petitioner and in the Farrell case, which was an Oklahoma case,

6

relied upon by the Court of Criminal Appeals in this opinion,

7

and I think in the Stock case, which I mentioned in the first

8

argument, has long required the use of preemptory challenges to

q

correct an error of this sort.
So, to say what the law in Oklahoma requires based on

l0
11

the statute and ignoring the case law doesn't fully

12

characterize and fairly characterize what the law is. The

13

Petitioner had a legitimate expectation to nine preemptories,

14

and he got them and used every one.

I5

correct what I concede was an error, but that is consistent

16

with the Oklahoma scheme of things and he didn't lose anything

17

that had been granted him thereby nor was there a different

18

rule really imposed in this case than there would be in any

I9

other criminal case in Oklahoma in which something similar

20

happened.

3I

One of them he used to

The Court has said that nothing in the Constitution

no

requires the grant of preemptories, but the trial by impartial

o ")*

jury is what is required.

24

whether or not the trial was impartial.

25

So, I turn my emphasis to looking at

In Lockhart, this Court said that the Constitution
30

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

presupposes a jury selected from a fair cross section of the

->

community is impartial, regardless of the mix of individual
viewpoints on that jury, so long as the jurors can

4

conscientiously and properly carry out their sworn duty under

5

the law, and the facts of a particular case.

6

There is no argument whatsoever in this case that the

7

jury that sat in Mr- Ross' trial did not meet that standard.

8

There was a potential Witherspoon problem had Mr. Huling been

9

seated, but the use of the preemptory challenge was a self-

10
11

correcting mechanism that took care of that problem.
There is no evidence in the record that the trial

12

counsel wanted or needed additional preemptory challenges, and

13

that's significant.

14

to adhere too closely to Gray■ If the trial lawyer had had a

15

problem, had had a real problem with that jury, he could have

16

spoken up and should have spoken up and tried to get the judge

18

he was trying to remove.

Instead, we want basically or the Petitioner wants

MR. NANCE:

that direction and that, of course,

I don't

It just happens the judge

nine of one side have to be used and the other nine aren't, is
it still equal?
MR. NANCE:

I think not there, Your Honor, and --

So, you don't really look at the way it

starts out because it's true, as they started out, they all had
nine and they all were subject to the problem they might have
to use them to correct judge's errors, but you sort of lose the
equality if the judge's errors got in one direction and not the
other.

what at eight and nine may not look very serious, begins to
look very serious, indeed, if it went all the way.
If I could, I'd like to turn for a moment to the due
process argument.

Unlike Hicks v. Oklahoma, the law in

preemptory challenges in this case does not create a
substantial and legitimate expectation of direct influence from
38
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

the deprivation of life or liberty.

1
2

In Hicks, this Court said that the Fourteenth

2

Amendment protected the Oklahoma provisions for jury sentencing

4

because the jury directly fixed the terms of the fundamental

5

deprivation of liberty.

6

!

1

I don't read anything in Hicks to say that the

7

Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalizes every trial procedure

8

or provision of state law for criminal trials.

o

1 think, in this case, had a substantial and a legitimate

0

expectation to nine preemptories with the traditional caveat of

The Petitioner,

11

Oklahoma law that if the judge erred on a challenge for cause,

12

you had to use a preemptory to correct that in the first

13

instance.

14

He, of course, received his nine and used them in one

15

case to remove Juror Huling.

I think the use of preemptory

16

challenges is too tangential to the final verdict and

17

sentencing to give a substantial and legitimate expectation of

18

influence over the verdict or deprivation of life or liberty

19

because, of course, there's been no evidence taken, no argument

20

made, no instruction by the Court, no deliberation by the jury.

2 1

It's one of the earliest things that happens in a trial, and

?7

one error in that case with the law of preemptory challenges, I

23

think, is just too attenuating.
The Petitioner in the brief also relies on the Logan

25

v. Zimmerman Brush case and makes the argument, which has been
39

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

advanced here, that there's an Oklahoma procedure that deprives

o

him of his right to preemptories.

z.

I think that is based upon the false premise that

"5

4

preemptories have to be in Oklahoma completely free and clear

5

of any interference.

6

there is a state procedure that requires their use to correct

7

errors.

As we discussed before, both sides have,

The Petitioner cited some cases.
Criminal Appeals relied on the Farrell case.

The Court of
I cited Stock, I

10

think, in the first argument, but unlike the irrational state

11

procedure which in Logan deprived the plaintiff of his right to

12

a cause of action, this rule is a reasonable rule.

1.3

QUESTION:

But, General Nance, isn't the reason for

14

the rule -- correct me if I'm wrong on this -- is that the

15

state wants to be sure that the defendant is not taking

16

advantage of an objection that he really wasn't sincere about,

17

that they really wanted to be sure that juror didn't sit, and,

18

so, they insisted that if they want to rely on the error as a

19

ground for reversal, that they actually have exercised a

20

preemptory to make sure it wasn't just an objection that sort

2I

of pro forma to something they really didn't care about?

27

It seems to me that would make a very sensible rule,

and it wouldn't create any problem at all as long as there are

if you had unlimited preemptories,

then you

would certainly insist on that, then the rule would solve the

problem of the sort of phony objection by the trial court.

5

MR. NANCE:

Well,

I think the purpose for the rule is

6

to remove error in the first instance,

7

be addressed by the trial court, much like making you object to

8

improper evidence.

So, you have to

I suppose there could

13

be an element of worrying about the defense just challenging

I4

everyone for cause and trying to build error.

15

thing is to require the defense to correct that error when it's

correctable,

17

do it again, and that's legitimate.

The circumstances of that rule could go either way in
41

Heritage Reporting Corporation

individual cases, but the rule is the same either way, and the

2

law, of course, benefits the state by making those trials which

3

really ought to be socially significant events as error-free as

4

possible and, therefore, our rule is not the irrational sort of
©
rule the Court condemned in Logan.

5

On the harmless error question, I think it is clear

6

7

and I don't hear any argument to the contrary that the error in

8

this case did not affect the truth-seeking function of the

9

jury.

I don't hear any evidence -- I hear hints, but I don't

.10

hear any serious argument that the error in this trial did not

11

affect any of the non-truth-seeking constitutional values that

12

the court would be interested in, like having racial bias.
In Batson, a racially-biased jury may or may not be

13
14

fair to the defendant, but there are independent constitutional

15

grounds in the Fourteenth Amendment, equal protection clause,

16

that just say we're not going to permit it.

17

is in any given case fair or not, we won't permit racial

18

discrimination.

Whether that jury

There's no argument in this case that there was any

19

20

error in that sort of constitutional value, and unlike in Gray,

21

there was no tribunal impanelled to return a verdict of death,

22

and, so, I think the Petitioner's suggested rule that anything

23

that would change the composition of the jury really doesn't

24

apply because it kind of takes that part of Gray out of

25

context.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

16

MR. PETERSON:

What the state says, in essence, is

17

that the right to preemptory challenge in Oklahoma is

18

conditioned by the state's right to arbitrarily take those

19

challenges away as a result of mistakes.
