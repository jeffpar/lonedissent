ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. MANION, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. MANION:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
This case presents the question whether a

11
12

Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas sitting in a Federal

13

employers liability act case is free to apply State' Court rules

14

concerning the propriety of an award of prejudgment interest

15

and the reduction of an award for impairment of future earning

16

power to its present value, or must apply the Federal law

17

applicable to those issues.
The facts relevant to this question can be stated

claimed damages first based on his lost wages to the date of

2

trial, which approximately $50,000.

3

future earning power based on his claim that he would earn

4

approximately $5,000 a year less as a radio supply clerk than

5

he would have as a brakeman conductor for the remaining fifteen

6

years of his expected work life.

7

And for impairment of his

At the close of the evidence, counsel for the

8

Railroad submitted a point for charge to the Court, requesting

9

the Court to charge the jury on reducing an award for

10

impairment of future earning power to its present value.

11

that request, there was specifically included a reference to

12

present worth tables of which the Court had already taken

1?

judicial notice, and which would assist the jury in making the

14

present worth reduction.

15

The Court

denied the request stating on three

16

separate occasions, both orally and in writing that the basis

17

for the Court's refusal was the recently announced decision of

18

the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania holding that a present worth

19

instruction should no longer be given in the Courts of the

20

Commonwealth in personal injury cases in which claims for

21

impairment of future earning power were asserted.

22

The Judge made that very specific in chambers in

23

ruling on the request for charge before she instructed the

24

jury, then again in the charge itself, and then thirdly in her

25

opinion on post-trial motions for judgment N.O.V. and for a new

trial.
After closing arguments of counsel and the Court's

2

3

charge, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff

4

for $125,000, an amount equal to the claim for lost wages to

5

the date of trial of $50,000 and of the claim for impairment of

6

future earning power at $5,000 a year for fifteen years, the

7

plaintiff being fifty years of age at the date of trial and

8

counsel arguing to the jury on behalf of the plaintiff that

9

although it could award damages to age 70, an award based on

10

retirement at age 65 would not be unreasonable.
Eleven days after the jury verdict and pursuant to a

11

12

motion of counsel for plaintiff and over the objection of

13

counsel for defendant, the Judge increased the jury's verdict

14

by adding thereto prejudgment interest at the rate of ten

15

percent per year to increase the $125,000 to approximately

16

$152,000.

17

The basis for that addition was a rule which had been

18

promulgated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1978, stating

19

that in bodily injury cases tried in the Courts of the

20

Commonwealth, such an award would be made provided that certain

21

conditions were met.

amount which the jury ultimately returned.

5
Reporting Corporation

1

encourage settlement in this kind of case?
MR. MANION:

2

It is, Your Honor.

The Pennsylvania

3

Supreme Court both in this case and in Laudenberger said that

4

its purpose was to encourage settlement to rid the courts of

5

congested dockets.

6

that was a substantive rule within the rulemaking part of the

7

Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

8

one year after the rule was promulgated, found it to be

9

procedural but acknowledged that it had very substantial

There are serious questions as to whether

substantive implications.
And the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has found it

11
12

to be substantive in the Jarvis case and therefore that a

13

Federal Court must apply it in a case in that Court based on

14

diversity of citizenship because of its substantial substantive

15

effect.

16

the rule was that it was within its rulemaking powers.

17

But the articulated reason by the Court in justifying

Of course, the Court had to justify it on that basis

18

because otherwise it would have been found to have not been

19

validly promulgated.

20

QUESTION:

But Pennsylvania doesn't say prejudgment

21

interest is awarded as a matter of right to a prevailing

22

plaintiff; it's only where there was a failure to submit an

23

offer of a particular kind by the defendant?

MR. MANION:

Yes, Your Honor, that is true.

And I should, to

bring the Court up to date, there was the Craig decision by the

2

Pennsylvania Supreme Court which came down between the Superior

3

Court and Supreme Court decision in this case which said that

4

there were questions of due process raised by the rule in that

5

the defendant may not have been at fault for the delay, and

6

therefore in cases after Craig where this issue came up, there

7

would have to be a hearing following the verdict and a

8

determination made.

9

But within the last month, the Court announced in

10

Craig that its procedural rules committee was instructed to

11

come up with a new rule.

12

Pennsylvania Bulletin on February 6th, which will take effect

13

in a month and a half, in essence provides that as long as no

14

offer has been made that upon the jury verdict, there will be

15

an award of prejudgment interest unless the defendant files a

16

motion affirmatively establishing that the plaintiff was the

17

cause of at least some of the delay.

18

The new rule as promulgated in the

Except for those conditions, Your Honor, that rule

19

was applied uniformly.

It was applied uniformly before Craig,

20

in the interval after Craig before the Supreme Court Procedural

21

Rules Committee came out with the suggested new rule, and it's

22

being applied every day in the Courts of the Commonwealth.

23

As Justice Hutchinson pointed out in the Supreme

24

Court of Pennsylvania, there can be no question that this rule

25

has a substantial effect on damages.

In this case, it

7

Heritage

8

1

increased the award by at least 20 percent.

2

That gets me to the point that the first question

3

really in many respects this case perhaps more than

4

coincidentally is being argued on the 50th anniversary by only

5

a few days

of this Court's decision in Erie Railroad v.

6

Tompkins.

As Your Honors will recall, that case involved the

7

question whether a Federal court, hearing a case based on its

8

diversity jurisdiction which arose solely under State law was

9

free to apply its own general version of what the common law

10

should be,

or was obliged to apply State law as construed by

11

the Courts

of the State.

12

And of course, Justice Brandeis' classic opinion and

13

landmark in the field of federal-state relations said that the

14

Federal court would have to defer to State law, not because of

15

any notion of superiority or inferiority between the two

16

systems of courts, but because of the fundamental precept.

17

First that the law to be applied to a claim should be the law

18

out of which the claim arose.

19

other rule would lead to chaos as it has in Pennsylvania

20

because the Third Circuit justice declared last August that you

21

cannot apply prejudgment interest in an FELA case.

22

Secondly, the fostering

principal purpose — or at least one of the primary purposes of

25

workers across the country, not only are we getting different

1

results between one state and another, but in Pittsburgh, you

2

will get a substantially different result depending upon

3

whether you file your suit at 7th and Grant in the Federal

4

Court where you won't get prejudgment interest, or up the

5

street at 4th and Grant, where you'll get an award of at least

6

20 percent in this case, substantially enlarging the damages.

7

It's clear that Federal law has to be applied here,

8

not because the Federal Courts are superior to the State

9

Courts, but this is a Federal Statute.

It cries out for

10

national uniformity and enforcement.

11

on the ground of a substantive procedural distinction.

12

And it can't be justified

This Court has long held in FELA cases starting at

13

least in 1916 in the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad v. Kelly case

14

the question of the proper measure of damages is inseparably

15

connected with the right of action.

16

under the FELA, it must be settled according to general

17

principles of law as administered in the Federal Courts.

18

And in cases arising

Eight years ago in the Liepelt case, Justice Stevens

19

said, it has long been settled that questions concerning the

20

measure of damages in an FELA action are Federal in character.

21

And Justice Blackmun in dissent stating that income tax

22

instructions the question whether they should be given is an

23

incidental matter.

24

But he said, of course, I assume that if this procedural rule

25

has substantive impact — as it does in our case — regardless

Perhaps we should defer to State procedure.

2

has to be resolved against the plaintiff, because when the FELA

3

was adopted in 1908, Congress took the state of the common law

4

as it then existed with respect to tort claims for personal

5

injuries and adopted in Section 1 a rule that provided that

6

FELA plaintiffs would be awarded damages for injuries sustained

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS HOLLANDER, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE.
MR. HOLLANDER:

11
12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
We're considering here today the application to a

14

remedial statute, the Federal Employers Liability Act of two of

15

what have become the most important cornerstones in the past

discussion, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in

Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz which has straightened up, at least for

20

the time being, some very curious developments in how we reduce

21

verdicts for impairment of earning capacity and other future

22

payments to present value.

Rule 238 about which there's already been some

23

I can't help but make this comment, that Rule 238

24

being designed to reduce congestion and delay which was the

25

avowed purpose of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in

promulgating it, if my colleague for the railroad is correct,

2

may do more to reduce the backlog in Federal Court because it

3

will attract litigants down Grant Street to the State Court

4

where their possibility of getting Rule 238 exists.
But nonetheless, it's the kind of rule -- about which

5
6

I'll speak later — that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court should

7

be permitted to promulgate to deal with the matter of the

8

disposition of the cases in its system.

9

I would like to first however discuss the total

10

offset method that was used to reduce the verdict in this case

11

to present worth.

12

For a long period of time, since this Court's decision in

13

Chesapeake & Ohio v. Kelly in 1916, announcing that future

14

payments in FELA cases, and for that matter, it has affected

15

the fabric of all litigation involving future payments and

16

especially personal injury litigation, must be reduced to

17

present value.

18

precise rule or formula for how that reduction was to take

19

place.

20

The trial court tried this case in 1981.

This Court in 1916 expressly did not lay down a

And said it was not its purpose to do so.
Thereafter then until the decision of this Court

21

through Justice Stevens in 1983 in the Pfeifer case, a period

22

of 67 years, the State courts and the Federal courts across

23

this country used a wide variety of methods to reduce future

24

impairment of earning capacity to present value, all with at

25

least the tacit approval of this Court, because this Court let

Heritage

Reporting Corporation

22
1

that go on for 67 years, and, I submit, should continue to let

2

it go on because we're talking about methods of proof and how

3

you handled methods of proof, evidentiary questions in trial

4

courts.

5

In 1980, in this context, the Supreme Court of

6

Pennsylvania said that they wanted this evidentiary rule based

7

on the theory that the market interest rate offsets the

8

inflation rate and that therefore we will consider those

9

totally offset and those issues will not be entertained for

10

evidentiary purposes, and that proposal will not be submitted

11

to the jury that the reduction to present worth will have taken

12

effect in that way.

13

That was to remedy an inequity that has been pointed

14

out in a number of the circuit courts to which the appellant

15

refers in which we had a situation where you could not

16

introduce inflationary evidence at all and still had a discount

17

to present worth which was essentially a double discount for

18

the defendant.

19

of what I submit is an economically inequitable process where

20

you get nothing for delay in an FELA case under ordinary

21

circumstances, and when all rules of the court are complied

22

with, up through until the time of trial even though economic

23

loss has occurred, but that future damages are discounted,

24

which is an economically inequitable circumstance.

25

And I should add, all of this is in the context

MR. HOLLANDER:

I mean, Congress did make that

Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you raised

4

that, because Congress — and we're talking now about

5

prejudgment interest, I take it, is what your question is -—

6

Congress said nothing about prejudgment interest.

7

inference that a Court made many mAny years ago, and not this

8

9

there would be no prejudgment interest permitted.

10

And in an

In 1908, there was neither prejudgment nor post­

11

judgment interest in this country, as I read these cases.

12

the fact that there was no interest at all mentioned was deemed

13

therefore without any discussion nor reference to the

14

Congressional Record, it's questionable whether Congress

15

considered it at all.

16

So

But what Congress did consider at that time, and an

17

examination of the Congressional Record will show — and I

18

would like to refer the Court — and it's not in my brief, but

19

I will read it into the argument — Congressional Record 60th

20

Congress First Session, Vol. 42 in 1908, at pages 4527 to 4550,

21

discussed the reasons for granting concurrent jurisdiction.

22

Justice Holmes in 1916, which was apparently a banner

23

year for litigation in this Court for FELA cases, referred to

24

the fact that the Congress was to anticipate — I'll give you

25

his words, which I think are pertinent here — "that Congress

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

24

1

contemplated suits in State courts and accepted State

2

procedures in advance."

3

about a lien on an FELA claim by a local lawyer and the

4

question that there couldn't be a lien because Congress hadn't

5

allowed it.

In that case there was a question

Oddly enough, about that same time, this Court

6

7

affirmed a State court addition of ten percent in an FELA case

8

in an appeal because the appeal was affirmed and the defendant

9

had to add ten percent to the award on that basis which is

10

coincidentally the same interest rate we're talking about here.
Congress was concerned when it granted concurrent

11

12

jurisdiction with the access of injured railroaders to the

13

courts in 1908 and the sizes of the Federal Districts and the

14

circuits, the question of how far people had to travel, how

15

they'd get their witnesses to court if it were a Federal Court

16

matter, and whether that imposed a great burden on the

17

litigant.

18

removal powers to a defendant in an FELA case because of the

19

costs and the denial of adequate access to the courts.

20

And Congress considered and determined not to grant

That was in 1908.

I submit, Your Honors, that at

21

this time in 1988, the denial to access of the litigants

22

injured in railroad cases and in any other cases to the courts,

23

is now the delay and congestion that's occurring which is

24

equally significant to the costs that would be incurred in the

long distance travels and the transportation and hiring of

In short, the

economic burdens that are placed on the plaintiffs now in the

3

delays means that their verdicts are less valuable and have

4

less meaning and are more costly in personal loss over the long

5

run than they would be with the use of prejudgment interest.

6

So I think that Congress has actually spoken to this

7

issue, but not talking about interest, talking about access to

the courts.

There are two issues that we seem to be addressing

here with regard to Rule 238 of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

11

One is whether prejudgment interest is an acceptable award in

12

an FELA case, pursuant to that rule, which we submit is a

procedural rule with substantive incidence.

prejudgment interest is appropriate in general.

cases because prejudgment interest is awarded in so many

MR. HOLLANDER:

I don't think they could take the

raised earlier during the railroad's argument concerning

whether it believed the jury should make the determination of

the method of selection is one that I would like to comment on

4

briefly.

5

the Pfeifer decision of Justice Stevens and this Court in 1983

6

applies in this case.

Because, interestingly enough, that would assume that

Amicus curiae, in its brief, indicates that Pfeifer

7
8

does not apply to this case, although the railroad takes the

9

position that it does, or at least it has taken that position

10

up to now.
The question that comes up with regard to Pfeifer is

11
12

this.

When it was decided in 1983, it gave council to the

13

courts and lawyers across the country that there were a number

14

of methods that were appropriate to use in FELA cases, or in

15

that case, I'm sorry, in 5(b) Longshoremen Harbor Workers Act

16

cases.

17

In that regard, Justice Stevens said that the total

18

offset method that Pennsylvania has adopted has the virtue of

19

simplicity and may even be economically precise, which we take

20

it really to be quite an endorsement of that process.

21

in that opinion, the discussion is that trying to approximately

22

impaired earning capacity by reduction to present worth is a

23

kind of rough and ready process.

24

economic precision, it would be of value.

25

Because

And if this one has some

What the Court said, however, was that a deliberate

2

Court sitting in Pittsburgh and said, you don't have to reopen

3

4

consider it.

5

the Court restated the Chesapeake & Ohio v. Kelly holding and

6

aqain selected no sinqle method as did the Kelly Court, the

7

same thing, and said with regard to what the lower Court should

do in Missouri was to require that whatever method is used,

that it take into account inflation, other sources of wage

At that point, the Court said, nothing was done in

12

Missouri, the Missouri Court ignored the entire question of

13

reduction to

present worth, and as a result, there was no

reduction to

present worth in that case.

to require an instruction.

16

And it was sent back

In the case before this Court now, I submit to you

17

that Kelly, Pfeifer and Dickerson have been complied with.

18

a matter of fact, I submit to you that the Pennsylvania Courts

19

have slavishly followed the reduction to present worth

20

requirements of Federal law in this case.

21

First of all, there was a reduction.

The record is

22

clear that the reduction was in conformity with the

23

Pennsylvania decision on using the total offset method.

24

Amicus, in its brief, admits that there was a reduction.

25

And what's the question then?

Heritage

line and the important part of the element of damages.

4

And it's obvious that the reduction is the bottom

QUESTION:

Well, the jury was not instructed that it

5

had to make a reduction or that it had t calculate present

6

worth.

7

MR. HOLLANDER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

What the

8

jury was instructed was that the Court was going to take care

9

of it.

It was an admonition essentially to the jury not to do

10

anything about inflation and not to do anything about

11

reduction.

12

QUESTION:

Well, do you suppose that Dickerson

13

requires at least that the jury be told they have to base

14

damages on present worth?

15

MR. HOLLANDER:

Your Honor, the jury was told that

16

their award would essentially have a reduced worth implication

17

because of what the Court told them it was doing with regard to

18

the use of the total offset method.

19

there is a reduction to present worth but the jury doesn't have

20

to calculate it.

The net effect is that

21

So what I think happened in this case, as a matter of

22

fact, based on the figures that were cited to you by counsel is

23

the jury may well have reduced it twice.

24

it'by the total offset method, and then when it went out to the

25

jury room to deliberate because if in fact the jury followed

the instructions of the Court, and if the defendant's

contention that all of the balance of the verdict of the

3

$125,000 less the $50,000 lost income was true, there would

4

have been no award for pain and suffering and the other

5

elements of emotional distress that are part of the award, and

6

the jury would have then disobeyed the Court's orders.
I submit to you that what the jury did was give less

7
8

than even the total offset method would have provided for in

9

this case.

10

After that — and by the way, I should also say that

11

the Judge did make a selection as the P.feifer case was

12

suggesting the non-jury district court case should be done and

13

that was between the total offset method which the plaintiffs

14

were prepared to submit and the position that the defendant

15

took in a request for instructions that essentially would have

16

caused a double discount because the Court had not entertained

17

evidence concerning inflation in accordance with Kaczkowski.

18

It instructed the jury on the income tax

considerations required by this Court in the Leipelt case and

20

then when the Pfeifer decision came down, which was after the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF< PAUL A. MANION, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

12

MR. MANION:

Your Honor, to answer Justice Stevens'

13

last question, part of the delay in the appellate courts was

14

that the Superior Court, on suggestion of counsel, delayed its

15

decision or consideration pending Pfeifer which had been

16

granted cert.

17

Pfeifer because of the thought that it might have some impact.

So that about two years of it was because of

18

Justice O'Connor, to address again your present value

19

question, it's our position that Dickerson controls and that as

20

Your Honor suggested, the Court must charge on present value.

21

What we say is that this Court, even assuming it were a Court

22

decision, a deliberate choice of the Court as Justice Stevens'

23

language suggests concerning that there must be a deliberate

24

choice, no such deliberate choice was made in this case by the

25

court, by the jury or anyone else.
