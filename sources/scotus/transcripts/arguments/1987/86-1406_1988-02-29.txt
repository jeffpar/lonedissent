ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNN R. COLEMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. COLEMAN:

9
10

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:
This is a preemption case, the issue being whether

11
12

Puerto Rico's regulation of gasoline marketing is preempted by

13

an alleged congressional purpose to create a completely free

14

market for petroleum products.
The temporary emergency Court of Appeals found that

15
16

such a purpose was exhibited in Congress' termination of

17

federal controls, and that such purpose banned state actions,

18

and accordingly affirmed the District Court judgment which had

19

preempted Puerto Rico's regulations.
Now there are a few points which I do not believe are

20
21

in dispute which I think should be mentioned at the outset by

22

way of background.

25

supply distribution chain.

First, no commerce clause issue has been

The regulation that we are concerned with is internal

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Now before passage of the Emergency Petroleum
Allocation Act in 1973, I think that it was perfectly clear
that the states could engage in regulation of this type.

It

would be within the historic police powers reserved to the
states.

And in fact, Puerto Rico did so for about twenty years

in a form quite similar in general terms at least to that which
was attempted here.
Now under the EPAA, as I say was passed in 1973 in
response to the Arab embargo, a temporary statute, there was
preemption of conflicting state laws, and certainly
Puerto Rico's own regulations were preempted at that time.

But

I do not think that anyone contends that if that statute had
expired on its planned expiration date that there would have
been any carry-over preemption thereafter.
So we are focusing here today on what happened in
1975 when Congress in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act or
the EPCA, as we call it, amended the EPAA in Title IV of the
EPCA.
Now this question has previously been before this
Court in the Tully case in 1981 and 1982, and this Court held
in an order vacating a TECA opinion that there after the
expiration of federal authority on September 30, 1981 that
there would be no preemption.
TECA, however, decided that it could depart from
Tully here, which it acknowledged would otherwise be

controlling, because it decided that the issue had not been

fully considered by this Court, and because it felt that it had

3

received contrary instructions in the subsequent Transeo

4

opinion, which it decided was applicable here, because the EPCA

5

revision of the EPAA involved a deregulatory statute similar to

6

what it considered had been done in the Natural Gas Policy Act

7

which revised the Natural Gas Act, which was considered in the

8

Transeo opinion.
Our position is that the two statutes involved in

Transeo and this case are completely different.

11

the statutory point more in a moment.

And I will discuss

And secondly, we think that TECA misread this Court's

As a

14

application of preemption concepts in Transeo.

And

15

principally, I think that this occurs because the Court ignored

16

the fact that in the Northern Natural case decided some twenty

17

years earlier, this Court had held that Congress preempted the

18

field, occupied the field, in natural gas regulation through

19

passage of the Natural Gas Act.
Now TECA was obviously influenced by the way that

this Court asked the question as to what was before it in

the Congress had actually intended to allow the states to act

2

after the federal controls expired.

3

But as I said, in Transeo, this Court had before it a

4

statute which had been held to occupy the field.

5

been made clear in a number of cases that where Congress

6

occupies the field that within the boundaries of that

7

occupation that it is presumed that the states will not be able

8

to act unless Congress has told them that they can act.

9

I think that is clear from a number of cases.

10

Now it has

I mean

But where you do not have that kind of situation,

11

which is what we have got here.

12

that there is a conflict with a congressional purpose, not that

13

Congress occupied the field in the EPAA.

14

There was an express preemption clause that said you preempt in

15

the case of conflict.

16

I mean the allegation here is

It is far from it.

So do not think that the preemption analysis that

17

this Court utilized when it asked that question that TECA was

18

so influenced by that that is applicable to this kind of case.

19

To the contrary, I think that this Court's usual rule, which it

20

has applied when it is making the initial determination of

21

preemption, that applies either in an occupation case or a

22

conflict case, that you start with the assumption that the

23

historic police powers were not to be superceded unless that

24

was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.

25

That was a quotation from Rice v. Santa Fe in 1947,

and it has been referred to any number of times subsequently,

2

as recently as International Paper decided in the last term

where it was referred to as a presumption that the state law

5

states.
Our position is that congressional silence of

6
7

ambiguity should be resolved in favor of state law and not

8

against it.

opposite.
Now if you look at what Congress did in the EPCA

10

i

I think that TECA erred in doing exactly the

11

amendment, I do not think that there is support for the

12

conclusion that TECA reached.

13

TECA erred in its reading of the legislative history and

14

certain inferences that it drew therefrom.

15

that Congress in allowing a statute to expire or more precisely

16

providing for its expiration after time intended to create a

17

completely free market that would bind the states thereafter

18

and prevent any state regulation of petroleum prices.

And specifically, we think that

23

not think that anybody would argue that if President Ford's

24

wishes had been granted and the EPAA had been allowed to expire

25

that there would be any preemption as a result of that at all.

And he asked for new standby authority which he can

I do

The House wanted long-term or permanent regulations,
they said.

They would keep the EPAA with some modifications

for ten years, and then convert to standby emergency authority.
The Senate pretty well agreed with the President, and wanted to
remove the mandatory controls promptly followed by a short
period of standby authority.
Now it is interesting to note that none of the
participants in this compromise negotiation which occurred were
asking for a completely free market or were asking for state
preemption after the EPAA authority expired.

There is just not

a word to support that, and the context is the contrary.
Secondly, the state preemption after EPAA expiration
was never mentioned in the hearings.
examined extensively.

This was a subject

And not in the debates, and not in any

of the reports of the committees of the House and the Senate,
and certainly not in the conference report.
And if you look at the amendment, the EPCA amendment,
there is certainly no statutory provision.

They either

expressly or by implication require preemption.
I think that TECA focused on the structure of the
EPCA amendment, and found some evidence to support its
conclusion there.

Now what was done in the EPCA amendment was

to take the mandatory controls which had been required in the
EPAA and continue them for a period of 40 months.

Those would

then be converted to a standby status for a period of 28

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

months, and that gets you to September 30, 1981 when the
statute in Section 18 plainly provides that all regulatory
authority expires.
Now the President had the authority under that scheme
to remove on a product by product basis individual petroleum
products from controls during the first 40 month period.

And

during the standby period, he could remove controls or reimpose
them at will; in other words, pursuant to his own discretion.
Now TECA found in its work that it was inconceivable
that Congress would go to the trouble of phasing out federal
controls with the intention that the states could step in.
they do not cite anything to support that inference.

Now

But it

seems to us, to borrow a phrase from the Court's opinion on the
Pacific Gas & Electric case —
QUESTION:

You conceive of it, that is enough, right?

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

What is that?

You conceive of it anyway, so it is not

inconceivable.
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

This Court said in that case that

it was inconceivable that Congress would intend to create a
regulatory vacuum, certainly without addressing it at all.

As

a matter of fact, it seems to me that that raises a question
whether you can really have preemptive effect from a
congressional intent or a congressional purpose which is not
either embodied in the statute or flows from the construction

The context is

22

saying that gradual is better than sudden.

But if you focus on

23

the phrase "return to an unregulated market", it certainly does

24

not indicate any dissatisfaction with the state of the law

25

before the EPAA was passed.

Heritage

10
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The other phrase appears on the next page.

And the

Congress said that we still have a problem, that we remain
vulnerable to interruptions.

And that it is possible that if

we had another embargo that we would have a serious problem.
And they noted that the President had asked for standby
emergency authority.

And they said, "Better that we should

convert the EPAA to standby authority than to write a new
bill," is what they said.
So you have this second reference that TECA found
significant which says that,

"Extension of the EPAA and its

conversion to a standby authority offers in addition the
potential for a smooth transition of petroleum markets from a
closely regulated state to a largely unregulated status subject
to standby pricing and allocation authority."
Now the context is clearly talking about the
situation before controls expire in 1981 rather than
thereafter.

Because when it says "largely unregulated status,"

it is one that is subject to standby authority, and not any
standby authority after September 30, 1981.
But I would submit that the phrase "largely
unregulated" is not inconsistent with there being a removal of
federal controls and some state regulation.

It certainly does

not say that there is going to be a completely free market.
And in the face of evidence like this, I would urge the Court
to be guided by what it said in cases like

Maryland which is cited in our brief, where it said that you

instead you must look for something specific in the statute or

the legislative history.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Coleman.

We will hear now from you, Mr. Harrison.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. HARRISON, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORT PETITIONERS
MR. HARRISON:

Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

and may it please the Court:
The temporary emergency Court of Appeals concluded
that in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 as
amended that Congress exercised its power to displace the
normal system of dual government, and the authorities of the
states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in a field
traditionally subject to their authority.
That conclusion was made despite the presumption that
normally Congress does not exercise that authority that it
unquestionably has, and it finds no support in the structure of
history of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act or in this
Court's cases.
The Act, the EPAA, has a preemption clause that
clearly does not apply to Puerto Rico's regulation that is at
issue here.

Moreover, there is no substantive provision of the

EPAA that would said to imply preemption in the sense that this
Court has used that concept whenever it has found implied
preemption, that is that there is no regulatory scheme of the
federal government that can be said to displace either

completely or in certain circumstances regulations by the

2

states of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
The cases in which this Court has found such

3
4

displacement have involved fairly careful inquiries into the

5

nature and content of the federal regulation, and there is

6

nothing like that left in the EPAA.

7

substantive rule at all.
Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the final

preemption.

11

EPAA.

Congress thought that it was doing with the EPAA was phasing it

13

out, instead of just letting it expire immediately.

14

had expired immediately, there was no suggestion that there

15

would have been preemption, and the expiration would have

17

18

There was no mention of ongoing preemption by the

Indeed, the context makes it quite clear that what

And if it

But no one suggested that after 1981 when the

19

statute's effects came to an end and when the President's power

20

was no longer available under the statute that there might have

21

been preemption.

22

Mr. Coleman noted, every other part of the EPCA, the 1975

23

legislation, deals with preemption explicitly.

24
25

This is particularly striking given that, as

In Title V of the EPCA, there is a presumption clause
dealing with Titles I and II.

Heritage

Title III, both parts of that

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

have their preemption clauses.

And Title IV, which amends the

2

EPAA, amends the statute that has its own preemption clause,

3

and it does not preempt explicitly.
So it is not as if Congress had come to think of this

4
5

field as naturally exclusively federal.

Congress was well

6

aware in 1975 that the area was still subject, unless it

7

displaced the traditional police powers of the states and the

8

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

suggested that the extraordinary result of preemption in the

to anyone.

This did not occur

And the only possible inference from that is that no

13
14

one thought that there was going to be ongoing preemption, that

16

thought that it meant in Tully after reading it, that the

question, that it could do as if often does when sunsets a

19

piece of legislation come back after the legislation has come

20

to an end.

21

And that if Congress wanted to revisit the

TECA went astray because of its misunderstanding of

22

this Court's opinion in Transeo, and in particular its

23

misunderstanding of the context of the discussion of this Court

24

on which it drew.

25

Natural held that Congress had occupied the field of wholesale

Northern

In Transeo, Congress had withdrawn FERC's regulatory

2

3

authority over certain categories of natural gas.

The Court in

4

Transeo began by noting that after the Natural Gas Policy Act,

5

the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act together,

6

remained comprehensive federal regulation of this field.

7

is to say the field was still occupied.

8

Congress said otherwise that there would be no regulation by

9

the states.

That

And hence, unless

The Court then inquired whether the withdrawal of

10
11

FERC's regulatory authority indicated that Congress had ceased

12

to occupy the field that the Court had found that it occupied

13

in Northern Natural.

14

the withdrawal of authority was not to that purpose, but it was

15

in order to create an open space within the area that Congress

16

continued to be occupying.

The Court's answer in Transeo was that

Now when Congress occupies a field, what it does in

17
18

19

20

government where both Congress and the states and Commonwealth

21

can form their own policy and says that only Congress makes

22

policy in this area, and only Congress makes the law in this

23

area.

24
25

That is it displaces the normal system of dual

Once that is done, it naturally follows that if
Congress decides not to regulate something, then of course it

16

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

is not going to be regulated at all.

But outside the context

of occupation of the field, there is no such suggestion and
there is no such suggestion of that sort in Transeo.

Transeo

simply found that Congress had not deoccupied those areas of
the field that it had deregulated.
There is also the suggestion from Respondents that
the role that it has played in Transeo by the Natural Gas Act
and the Natural Gas Policy Act might be filled in this case by
the other titles of the general policy of the EPCA.

But as

Mr. Coleman noted, this Court has made it very clear that
general congressional policy at the level of abstraction that
it has found in the EPCA does not overcome the presumption of
preemption.

And indeed, Commonwealth Edison v. Montana

addressed the specific policy of the EPCA, of one of the EPCA's
substantive provisions, having to do with the use of coal.
And what the Court found was yes, in the EPCA,
Congress took certain steps in favor of coal.

And yes, the

Montana severance tax could raise the price of coal.

But that

is not the kind of clash of policies that will lead the Court
to infer preemption, to infer that Congress has exercised its
authority to move aside the states.
Rather the Court inferred in Commonwealth Edison and
should infer here that unless it has made it clear, Congress
has left in place the normal relationship between the levels of
government.

Congress is still formulating national policy, and

Heritage

17

the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are free to

2

formulate their own policy.
There is no suggestion to the contrary anywhere in

3

the EPAA.

And therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals

5

should be reversed.

QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

All right.
The second question, Mr. Chief Justice,

is what Congress' purpose was in 1975.

My colleagues

see -QUESTION:

You propose kind of a dichotomy in your

first question.
Should the question be did the Congress intend to
create a free market in petroleum after 1981, and then the
alternative is did it intend to preempt state regulation after
1981, and what is the difference between those two questions?
MR. EVANS:

Well, the difference is illustrated,

Mr. Chief Justice, by the definition of intention to preempt
that is given in this case, which is really central to the
analysis of the Petitioners and the Solicitor General.

And

that definition is stated most clearly at page 9 of the reply
brief, where the Petitioners say that what must be shown is an
indication that Congress, and these are the words,

"had in mind

the preemption of state law once federal controls expired."
Well, even if intent to preempt is the right
standard, just last month in the Thompson case, the Parental
Kidnapping Act case, the Court rejected precisely that kind of
an approach to a question of congressional intent.

It said in

connection with the implication and the finding of an implied
cause of action under that statute that while congressional
intent is the right issue, we do not look to see whether

The only purpose that is relevant is the substantive purpose,

How do you apply that kind of analysis to

Justice Scalia, I do not think that this

QUESTION:

I am talking about Brown, where we have

MR. EVANS:

The question, Justice Scalia, is when

Congress enacted in this case the EPCA in 1975, what had it set

It was not a judgment that we have lost interest in the area of

was the major political debate of the year.

It was a burning issue.

Those were the goals.

11

Now what was the mechanism

that it chose to get there.

The principal mechanism which was

13

central to the entire debate, and which was clearly underlying

14

President Fords' insistence upon his position and the Congress'

15

ultimate acquiescence to it was an uncontrolled and unregulated

16

market.
The whole judgment that brought the issue to the fore

18

was the conclusion that controls were doing just the opposite.

19

Controls were keeping prices low, which meant that consumption

went up.

production went down.

was exactly contrary to what the national policy ought to have

MR. EVANS:

Well,

I do not know that I can speak

conversantly with the Sherman Act.
QUESTION:

Well, you know the Sherman Act.

The

policy was simply that we do not want unreasonable restraints
in trade.

Yet we have always interpreted that not to preclude

states from allowing private organizations to impose
restrictions, as long as the states adequately supervise them.
And for the states themselves to create all sorts of
distortions to the competitive market.
Now were those cases wrongly decided; and if not, why
is that different from what you are urging on us here?
MR. EVANS:

I wish that I were better prepared to

respond to the Sherman Act.

I just do not have a feel for the

cases and what analysis led the Court to those conclusions, nor
do I really have a feel for the underlying purposes that may
have been exhibited in the legislative history.
I do think that the closer analogy here is the
decision in the natural gas area, Transeo which has been
referred to,.

We think that really this case is Transeo with

two changes to it.

Number one, this is total deregulation
And number two, the conflict here with

the free market is a direct one and not a remote one.
QUESTION:

But I think that you have to deal with

some of the contentions that the Petitioner makes, that the
Northern Natural Gas case in 1963 had held the whole area

And then when Congress backs off of one limited

section, does that mean that the states are now free to come
in.

It strikes me that that is quite different than Congress

backing off entirely the way that it did here.
MR. EVANS:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that there is

that element of Transeo.

It is unquestionable that there was a

blend in the decision, the majority decision, of what I am
referring to as conflict preemption principles, the question of
whether state laws stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment
of the federal purposes, and field preemption principles under
which Congress basically must require explicitly assignment of
regulatory jurisdiction exclusively to itself.
There is both of that.

And it is true that the

But the conflict analysis in Transeo stands on its

The only question was whether the rateable take order

which was not a well head price regulation measure directly
anyway was in fact a conflict with the free market objectives
that Congress had.
Now the majority of the Court felt that it was.

But

it obviously reinforced that judgment with the notion that even
if it was not, that is even it was harmonious with the federal
law, this was a kind of field preemption which excludes not
only conflicting state law but also harmonious state law.

Heritage

24
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I think that there was a blend there, but I think
that had the case been different, had the case been a complete
deregulation case, had Congress instead of just picking out
certain categories of natural gas had deregulated all natural
gas, notwithstanding the background of Northern Natural, and
had the case been a direct well head price regulation, the
result would have been exactly the same.

And it would have

been unanimous, if I understand the opinions.
QUESTION:

May I ask one question.

If I understood

your opening comments, you said that the question was whether
in 1975 Congress intended that there be a free market after
1981.
Does that mean contrary to what your opponents said
that you would really contend that there was preemption even if
the statute had expired by its terms?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

No.
Then you are really arguing that

preemption occurred at the time of the repeal or the amendment?
MR. EVANS:
Stevens.

That is absolutely correct, Justice

Our view is that there must be, and we do not contest

this, that there must be a statute enacted by Congress that
embodies what we have characterized as a deregulatory purpose.
We cannot apply the supremacy clause to foreclose state law in
the absence of a federal statute, but there was a federal
statute.

Had there been none, had the debate gone forward in

QUESTION:

No, no, I did not say if there had been

nothing.

I just said that if they had enacted the statute in

4

1975 and then let it expire by its term.
MR. EVANS:

But we cannot do it

We are too tied to the controls that we are now
We have to do it in a gradual way.

The ultimate compromise which was a difficult and

17

hard fought one with vetoes flying back and forth across

18

Pennsylvania Avenue was that Congress got what it most desired

19

which was temperance, let us do this in a calm measured way,

20

let us deregulate gradually so that the economy can adjust.

21

The nation was just recovering from a deep recession, and the

22

Congress was very concerned for obvious reasons about the

23

impact of sudden decontrol.

24
25

What the President got though was what he most
prized, which was a firm commitment by Congress to ultimate

that Congress in fact intended markets to operate freely, that

as this Court found in Transeo, that the Puerto Rico

with the congressional purpose.

And it further found,

states any authority that it had withdrawn from the federal

27
Reporting Corporation

government, we think that the question properly understood was

2

whether notwithstanding the purpose of deregulation,

3

notwithstanding the purpose to create a free market, did

4

Congress intend to leave the states free to interfere with the

5

state market, and the answer to that question was plainly no.
The burden ought to be once a free market purpose is

found on those who would like state regulation to survive to

8

show that Congress would have anticipated state regulation

notwithstanding the apparent conflict.

And the Court has

occasionally asked that question and found that kind of an

11

answer.

12

QUESTION:

Of course, all of the legislative history

13

that you point to could be just as well explained by a Congress

14

that really was not averting to state regulation at all,

15

because it never conceived that state regulation would at all

16

be feasible to destroy a free market.

17

Perhaps in a place like Puerto Rico or maybe Alaska

18

and maybe Hawaii, but certainly in the Continental United

States, do you think that you can have local state regulation

20

that could possible be effective given that the interstate

channels are deregulated?

Now let us focus on his contention that there is such

Now if that was what the President wanted, that he

the EPAA to expire, it does not seem to me that he had in mind

We submit that none of the participants in that debate

12

But on every occasion when the Administration came to

13

the Congress to discuss whether or not there ought to be

14

preemption and in following the expiration of the EPAA, there

15

was quite an interchange between the Congress and the

16

Administration, they took the position one, that there was not

17

any preemption at the present time; and two, that there should

not be any preemption, even though they believed in

deregulation.

deregulation equals preemption.
