ORAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS FRANK, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

Mr. Frank, you may proceed

MR. FRANK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case arises out of an employment contract

12

case arising under Colorado law wherein the Plaintiff was

13

a sales commissioned agent for the sale of the Appellant's

14

products.

IS

The case was brought in 1982 when the course of

16

the law was changing both with respect to employment law in

17

Colorado and with respect to this Court's decisions on the

18

issues of attorney's fees and the federal rules of civil

19

procedure.
The case was eventually removed to the Federal

20
21

District Court in Colorado and tried on diversity

22

jurisdiction basis.

23

Colorado law was deemed applicable by the Federal District

24

Court.

25

under Colorado law, included as part of the judgement, as

At the conclusion of that case,

A verdict was entered for monetary damages which,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

4
1

part of the merits on the case, and a mandatory award of

2

attorney's fees as part of the relief entitled under the

3

public policy and the laws of Colorado.
QUESTION:

4
5

All the law said is that the attorney's

fees are required in these cases.
MR. FRANK:

6

The normal cases construing attorney's

7

fees have dealt with taxing attorney's fees as cost, or as

8

an ancillary or collateral matter, Mr. Justice.

9

The actual statute in Colorado provided that

10

whenever it is necessary for an employee to commence a civil

11

action for the recovery or collection of wages under our

12

Colorado Peace Act, the judgement in such actions shall

13

include a reasonable attorney fee in favor of the winning

14

party.
QUESTION:

15

So you say that's different from the

16

normal award of attorney's fees?

17

MR. FRANK:

In that there is no court

18

determination mandated in that, for one thing.

19

left to the discretion of the court as —
QUESTION:

25

It is not

As to whether to grant attorney's

fees?
MR. FRANK: -- as to whether to grant the
attorney's fees or not.
QUESTION:

Sort of like in the treble damage

antitrust case?
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

5

MR. FRANK:

I

It could be analogized to that.

2

It could also be argued that this is part of the verdict

3

function, for the finder of fact to try.

4

it isn't even a court determination under that language.

5

It's: part of the judgement shall include attorney's fees.
QUESTION:

MR. FRANK:

9

QUESTION:

MR. FRANK:

That isn't the way it works in

It would be a case of first

impression, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

13
14

It could be.

Colorado, in the Colorado courts, is it?

11

12

You mean to be decided, as to amount,

by the jury?

8

10

It may be that

You mean nobody's ever raised the

point?

15

MR. FRANK:

Nobody has ever raised it before.

16

QUESTION:

But the practice is that the judge

17
18

decides the amount, in the Colorado courts?
MR. FRANK:

The practice is the judge decides

19

the amount and the fact of this case is that it was

20

submitted to the judge for a determination and this case

21

was tried to a jury.

22

decisions in White and Marek v. Chesny, the distinction in

23

the language here could be that this is not within the

24

jurisdiction.

25

But in view of the Court's recent

That is the essence of the Plaintiff's case

before the Court here today, that this is an Erie v.

2

Tompkins.

3

here interpreting the federal rules or the federal statutes

4

with respect to civil rights fees.

5

whether or not the state of Colorado could, as a practical

6

matter, under Erie, make attorney's fees part of the merits

7

of the case, part of the substantive relief, part of the

8

remedial relief, if you will, that is designed to compensate

9

and redress the Plaintiff if he prevails, or perhaps the

10

Defendant in an appropriate case, for the damages suffered,

11

or to encourage some state public policy.

12

This is a 28 USC Section 1652 case.

QUESTION:

We're not

We're here deciding

Counsel, what did the legislature

13

have in mind when they added the final phrase to the

14

statute: to be taxed as part of the cost of the action?

15

You're correct.

It says that the judgement in

16

such action shall include a reasonable attorney fee.

17

then it says: to be taxed as part of the cost of the action
What did the legislature have in mind, adding

18
19

20

But

that?
MR. FRANK:

We would submit that after the

21

comma, and that the language that you are quoting,

22

Mr. Justice, is the procedural part of how the attorney's

23

fees are to be collected.

24

Rule 54, which is the same in Colorado as it is under the

25

federal rules, or an entry of judgement under Rule 58, is

That a taxing matter under

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

1

a mere procedural formality for the clerk to do.

2

can do it in one day.

3

necessary once the attorney's fees are apportioned or

4

determined, perhaps by the finder of fact, or perhaps by

5

the court.

6

the attorney's fees become a part of the judgement, that

7

they would then be taxed.

8

The clerk

There is no further adjudication

That it's merely a procedural device as to how

QUESTION:

Well, is the entry of the judgement

9

postponed until the amount of the attorney's fees is

10

determined?

11

MR. FRANK:

In Colorado it has been.

Colorado

12

cases not only dealing with the Labor Peace Act, of which

13

this case arises, a Wage Act claim.

14

unitary on the point that the judgement is not final.

15

All Colorado cases are

The issue of finality in Colorado is exactly

16

the reverse of the issue of finality under the White case

17

and under the Marek v. Chesny case, ruled on the Civil

18

Rights Act cases.

19

until the question of attorney's fees is decided,

20

determined in substance, and that decision becomes part of

21

the case.

22

In Colorado we have no final judgement

QUESTION:

Well, it does seem there is some

23

sense to what the Tenth Circuit said that you are really

24

inviting just a mass of confusion if in a case tried in

25

the District Court in the federal system you have to
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8
1

examine each state statute to see whether attorney's fees

2

are part of the recovery or separate.

3

states, of course, and you'll just have a proliferation of

4

independent inquiries like that.

5

MR. FRANK:

You have fifty

Mr. Justice, we would suggest that it

6

is no more complicated or taxing than the substantive state

7

law, come determinative cases, on the Erie line of cases.

8

The Hanna v. Plumber test requires a statute

9

of limitations of the state of Oklahoma, or the appellate

10

procedure if it has substantive outcome of Oklahoma to be

11

followed by the Tenth Circuit.

12

QUESTION:

But this type of thing determines the

13

timeliness of appeals in that sort of thing.

14

a little bit different effect than just a branch of

15

substantive law.

16

MR. FRANK:

So it has

That is correct but only in the

17

sense that finality under 28 USC 1291 can be interpreted

18

either way.

19

system, if in fact the collateral adjudication doctrine

20

is followed for the civil rights cases.

21

interpreted to allow a state under Erie to include a

22

thing, be it a label called attorney's fees or be it a

23

supplementary adjudication of incremental damages of some

24

kind, as part of the substantive relief, as part of the

25

finality issue under that state's law.

It can be interpreted one way for the federal

It can also be

9
1

QUESTION:

But if we .interpret it the latter way,

2

so that a state may vary in deciding whether attorney's

3

fees are part of a judgement or something added after, so

4

that it's different from our White doctrine in the federal

5

attorney's fees statute, then every single federal court

6

is faced with the statutes of several different states.

7

And it may be that one state statute means one thing and

8

one another.

9

diversity.

10

It's just a tremendous proliferation of

MR. FRANK:

We would suggest, Mr. Justice, that

11

if the outcome, if the remedy, is part of substance, that,

12

under the state system level, then the Erie doctrine would

13

prevent a simple procedural rule from applying in the

14

so-called bright line manner in which the Tenth Circuit

15

does follow.

16

All attorney's fees, if they are denominated as

17

attorney's fees, under the Tenth Circuit Cox v. Flood case,

18

are severable and collateral issues and not part of the

19

merits of the case.

20

preclude a state from the option of including attorney's

21

fees.

22

That bright line rule does, in fact,

It can be that you have a -QUESTION:

What's the practical difference, so

23

far as Plaintiffs and Defendants suing each other in real

24

courts are concerned, other than the fact that an appeal

25

may be untimely if you follow one rule?

What would be the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

10

1

practical difference in saying that in federal courts, even

2

if Colorado might provide one way, in the federal court the

3

attorney's fees are collateral?

4

MR. FRANK:

It could affect substance in the

5

essence, in the simplest sense, that the trial court judge

6

would retain jurisdiction over the attorney's fee issue

7

and force a double appeal.

8

under the Tenth Circuit now.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. FRANK:

In essence, that is what happens

And it happens in federal cases?
It happens in federal cases under the

11

Collateral Rule doctrine perhaps because of the injunctive

12

relief factor on the — the only federal cases that are

13

well-hammered out are the civil rights cases, the 42 USC 1988

14

cases to implement 1981, 1982 and 1983.

QUESTION:

And there, there is a double appeal,

isn't there?
MR. FRANK:

And there, in essence, there is a

double appeal.
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference in the

amount you recover or anything like that?
MR. FRANK:

It does if you exclude injunctive

22

relief, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

under the federal system in the federal civil rights

24

cases for bifurcating the issue of attorney's fees if, in

fact, there's going to be a long mandatory injunctive

There is a very good reason

accomplished by the attorney.

School bus injunction cases that go on, for

the purpose of integration, for example, there there is no

mandatory and supervision.

the initial determination of the need for the injunctive

10

relief needs to go forward or it would never get tested

if you had to await, in that instance, for an attorney's fee

review.

All of the

In that instance, the appeal of

That's not true in a labor and wage statute
where there is no injunctive relief.

QUESTION:

The reason you apply Erie in a federal

17

court is so you'll get the same substantive result,

18

substantive law result, in federal court as you do in

19

state court.

attorney's fees in this federal court proceeding give you

any different substantive outcome in your particular

MR. FRANK:

If the intention of the statute is to

encourage or to make parties -- in essence, all attorney's

6

fees cases enacted by statute are compensatory.

7

an attempt by a legislature to either encourage a private

8

attorney general function or they are an attempt to bring

not be sufficient to encourage deterrence of the conduct

before the courts need it to be.

QUESTION:

But I still haven't heard you say

9

anything as to how if you could recover $10,000 damages and

10

$5,000 attorney's fees — say, if you're trying this case

11

in the District Court of the City and County of Denver,

12

you couldn't also recover $10,000 damages and $5,000

13

attorney's fees if you're trying it in the United States

District or for the District of Colorado?

15

MR. FRANK:

It would be you would lose the right.

16

You would the lose the right to have the entire situation,

17

both attorney's fees and damages, weighed as a total

18

judgement on the merits in relation to the substantive

19

purpose and intent of the statute.

20

If, in fact, the public policy is to deter or to

21

encourage the bringing of small wage claims, for example,

22

then you preclude by a federal rule of civil procedure the

23

timeliness of an appeal under Appellate Rule 4(a)

24

implementing 28 USC 1291 -- you preclude that substantive

25

modification process under the state law of Colorado, if

your argument.

QUESTION:

21

Are you talking about arguments made

22

in the trial court or arguments made in the Court of

23

Appeals?

24
25

MR. FRANK:

I'm saying that, under Erie and under

the unitary — there is not variation in Colorado — under
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

15
1

the unitary treatment of cases in Colorado, a case is not

2

final in the federal sense under 1291 until attorney's fees

3

are part of that judgement.

4

QUESTION:

I understand the conceptual argument,

5

but I think the Chief Justice was asking you as a practical

6

matter, what difference does it make?

7

and you say I am entitled to $10,000 substantive recovery

8

and I think you ought to give me a $5,000 fee for

9

deterrent purposes and because of the work and so forth and

10

so on.

11

take your appeals?

12

You go to the judge

Can't you make the same arguments whenever you

MR. FRANK:

You could make those same arguments.

13

We admit that you could make those same arguments.

14

reason for those arguments, we respectfully suggest, would

15

only be an administrative or an efficiency concept under

16

the federal system.

17

you don't have the same — we submit that the court doesn't

18

have the same — power to implement 1291 through 4(a), or

19

any other rule, where it's going to be outcome

20

determinative or change of procedure or preclude -- more

21

accurately — preclude a state from using attorney's fees

22

not as cost but in any substantive manner within which

23

they may choose.

because it is going to be a bright line, collateral issue

QUESTION:

3

But there's nothing to be decided

about attorney's fees except amount, in Colorado rule.

5

There's nothing to litigate except amount.

MR. FRANK:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FRANK:

9

It could be.
Well, it is.

Isn't that right?

If, in fact, it could be a source

of who decides it, as suggested earlier.
QUESTION:

10

If a liability is appealed separately

11

and it's reversed, there's not going to be any attorney's

MR. FRANK:

There would not be under the Peace

That's correct.
QUESTION:

15

If the Plaintiff wins and the

16

Defendant appeals and wins on the merits, there's not

17

going to be any attorney's fees?

18

MR, FRANK:

19

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Under your view then, every single

20

case you're going to have to litigate the amount of

21

attorney's fees before you can ever appeal and you're

22

going to have just a lot of useless — everytime there's

23

a reversal, the litigation on attorney's fees will be

24

useless.

MR. FRANK:

The litigation on attorney's fees

insofar as --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. FRANK:

It would just be a waste of time.
It would be.

It would be in the

4

sense that attorney's fees become a collateral issue rule

5

to be determined only after liability.

6

QUESTION:

Well, it's bad enough to have two

7

pieces of litigation in every case: one on the merits and

8

one on attorney's fees, but it's even worse to go through

9

the procedure of litigating the attorney's fees when there

10

may be no need for it.

11

MR. FRANK:

If, in fact, a state chooses to put

12

the attorney's fees issue into an element of the case on

13

the merits it is implicit within that decision: a) that

14

they have a right under Erie to do it and b) that it is

15

going to increase the complexity of the litigation.

16

QUESTION:

Can't we decide how the matters will

17

be appealed?

18

the federal courts, choose to take them one at a time and

19

make sure that there's a need to reach the second one?

20

What does the state care whether our courts,

MR. FRANK:

If, in fact, that decision is for a

21

procedural rule efficiency or efficacy in the administration

22

of the federal courts and if, in fact, it changes the

23

substantive law of the state or changes the finality

24

requirement under state law, which has substance implicit

25

within it, then we respectfully submit you can't do it.
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

18
1

QUESTION:

Well, I agree.

If there's some aspect

2

of the finality requirement that could conceivably affect,

3

let's say, rais judicata or something like that, then I

4

could see how you might have an argument that it has some

5

substantive impact.

6

is not substantive impact but the process for getting the

7

matter appealed.

8

shouldn't the federal courts, set their own ground rules?

9

If Colorado wants to waste the time of its District courts

10

figuring out what the correct amount of attorney's fees is

11

when it may not be necessary that's up to Colorado, but

12

why do we have to do that?

13

But really all we're talking about here

Why can't the federal courts, why

MR. FRANK:

Because, Mr. Justice, you impose

14

upon Colorado the federal civil rights developing

15

bifurcation collateral issue label for attorney's fees.

16

The issue would not arise if there was a

17

compensatory provision within the statute or another

18

condition within the statute that was not called an

19

attorney's fee, or was not called a cost.

20

attorney's fees are rolled into this language, arguably

21

within this language, as part of the merits of the claim

22

itself as opposed to a determination, post-determination,

23

of the merits, if you rule that way on the federal level

24

in effect you're going to bifurcate every case.

25

QUESTION:

But because

Mr. Frank, let me ask you a question

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

19

about how Colorado judges deal with this type of wage

2

statute which I see your opponent says really isn't, doesn't,

3

treat it much different than the federal courts do.

4

the judge charge the jury that they may return in their

S

verdict along with lost wages and that sort of thing also

6

attorney's fees?

7

MR. FRANK:

There has not, to my knowledge, ever

8

been a case that has done that.

9

QUESTION:

10

damages.

11

right?

12

Okay.

So the verdict is just

It does not include attorney's fees.

MR. FRANK:

Does

Is that

To my knowledge, the issue has not

13

been determined whether it could go to a verdict or not.

14

That's correct.

15
16

Then the judge determines, much like Georgia v.
Johnson on the federal level.
QUESTION:

17

Well, my question was: a verdict

18

just embraces damages and not attorney's fees.

19

correct or incorrect?

20

MR. FRANK:

21

It just embraces damages.

Is that

That is

correct.

22

QUESTION:

23

for attorney's fees?

24

MR. FRANK:

25

QUESTION:

So then you apply later to the judge

So far that is correct.
And how does that differ from the

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

20

2

federal system?
MR. FRANK:

It differs from the federal system

3

now in that the case is not final under Colorado's process,

4

if you will — I won't go any further than to use the word

5

process -- until that determination becomes part of the

6

record, howsoever it's done.

7

8

QUESTION:

And to my knowledge —

So it's a question about when the

judgement becomes final?

9

MR. FRANK:

10

If there are no further questions, I would like

11

It's a question of finality, currently.

to reserve the remaining amount of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY TERRE LEE RUSHTON, ESQ.

15

18

Thank you, Mr. Frank.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. RUSHTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Respondent submits that the adoption by this

19

Court of a rule which recognizes that attorney's fees are

20

collateral to a judgement on the merits is the only rule

21

which promotes uniformity, finality, judicial economy, and

22

fairness to all the litigants in a federal court action.

23

We believe that the adoption of a rule

24

recognizing that attorney's fees are, in fact, collateral

25

to a judgement on the merits promotes several important
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21
1

policies of this Court.

2

guesswork over the timing of a federal court appeal.

3

makes uniform those procedures for appealing judgement and

4

for making attorney's fees applications regardless of the

5

source of the fees and avoids needless litigation over

6

issues of finality and divergent interpretations of state

7

law.

8

It clarifies and eliminates
It

Now, the Petitioner seeks to avoid the decision

9

of the Tenth Circuit by claiming that because this is a

10

diversity action and because he perceives a conflict between

11

federal procedure and state law, that state law should

12

govern.

13

The first question, then, to be addressed by

14

the Court is, in fact, whether the timeliness of the federal

15

appeal is governed by federal law and we think that it is.

16

The right to appeal, of course, is created by federal

17

statute 28 U.S.C. 1291, which provides that final decisions

18

of the District court may be entertained by the federal

19

Appellate courts and it's implemented by the federal Rules

20

of Civil and Appellate Procedure, specifically Rule 4(a)(1)

21

which provides that the notice of appeal shall be filed

22

with the Appellate Court thirty days after entry of a

23

final judgement on the merits.

24
25

An entry of judgement is defined in federal
Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) by reference to the
Heritage Reporting Corporation

22
1

federal Rules of Civil Procedure 58 and 79.

2

forth the entire mechanism for processing an appeal through

3

the federal system.

4

parties know when the judgement is ready for appeal.

5

encompass the procedure for a federal appeal, and we believe

6

that those federal rules are intended to occupy the field,

7

explicitly or implicitly.

8

of a conflicting state court procedure.

9

Those rules set

The purpose of the rule is to let all
They

There is no room for the operation

We also believe that the application of the

10

federal Rules of Appellate and Civil Procedure in this case

11

do not transgress either the Constitutional restrictions

12

that this Court has recognized nor any statutory

13

restrictions.

14

The rules regulating the timing of an appeal in

15

the federal court are indisputably procedural rules and,

16

therefore, a priori, Constitutional.

17

They do not embridge and they do not modify any state-created

18

entitlement to damages in this action nor to fees.

19

merely regulates the procedure for enforcing that right in

20

the federal system.

21

QUESTION:

They do not enlarge.

It

Well, that's true but they don't give

22

us limitless discretion as to how to regulate it.

23

example, you're right that it's more efficient not to make

24

the District court resolve an issue that may be irrelevant.

25

But we certainly cannot allow an initial appeal in, let's

it's one cause of action created by the state, why is that

issue, whether under the Wage Claim Act attorney's fees

21

We believe that Colorado law has not spoken to the

QUESTION:

And you agree that if you're wrong

about that, you lose?

24

MS. RUSHTON:

25

QUESTION:

No.

Well, then you want to answer my

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

24
1

question, don't you?
MS. RUSHTON:

2

Yes.

Sir, we simply don't believe

3

that this is under the same stricture, that it doesn't

4

create the same kind of problems that other cases coming

5

before this Court under the Collateral Order doctrine create.
This is a situation that's purely mechanical.

7

It talks about the way to enforce rights and doesn't intend

8

to bifurcate the entitlement to those rights.

9

decision on the merits that can be appealed and there's a

10

right to attorney's fees which can also be appealed.

11

I think both the Colorado legislature and this Court have

12

directed that they are to be appealed in a particular manner

13

and a manner which we do not believe abridges any of those

14

rights.

15

There's a

But

Rule 54(d) and 58 have been amended to address

16

what we believe is the conflict present herein.

17

that the federal rules govern that question by designating

18

that where, as here, these attorney's fees are to be taxed

19

as cost of the action there's a Congressional history that

20

shows that they should be separated.

21

We believe

The practical considerations also dictate that

22

there's a uniform rule in the federal courts whether these

23

matters arise under a federal claim or by diversity of

24

jurisdiction.

25

are costs and it is clear that v/hen Rule 58 was amended in

For example, under Rule 58 fees, we believe,

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

25
1

1946 costs were determined not to delay the entry of

2

judgement.

3

and the merits of an action applies particularly to

4

attorney's fees, which are both practically distinct from

5

the merits of an action and philosophically distinct.

6

They are practically distinct because as we've touched

7

upon it depends on the determination of the prevailing, or

8

winning, party, as the Colorado statute puts it and, also,

9

that costs accrue throughout the litigation.

10

judgement on costs can't be made until, in fact, there is

11

a final judgement on the merits of the case.

12

philosophically distinct because attorney's fees are

13

compensation for the costs of going through the litigation,

14

not as compensation for the wrong that the Plaintiff

15

alleges was done to him.

16

That distinction between the costs of an action

And a final

They are

We believe that the drafters of Rule 58 intended

17

to include attorney's fees as costs and that this delay

18

that would attend the Petitioner's interpretation of this

19

problem is exactly the problem that Rule 58 was designed

20

to avoid by separating determinations on costs from

21

determinations on merits.

22

However, if this Court would decline to find

23

that attorney's fees are costs, we still believe that this

24

fee determination should be found to be collateral to a

25

judgement on the merits.

This Court declined in the case —

QUESTION:

2

MS. RUSHTON:

3

Are costs or are not costs?

QUESTION:

5

MS. RUSHTON:

7

Attorney's fees -- if

this Court would find that attorney's fees are not costs —

4

6

I'm sorry.

Are not costs.
— we still believe they would be

collateral to a decision on the merits.
We believe that the reasoning of this Court in

8

White v. New Hampshire would apply equally here.

9

as to the reasonableness of attorney's fees requires the

10

kind of detailed inquiry that this Court went into in great

11

detail in Hensley v. Eckerhart.

12

QUESTION:

A decision

Wouldn't you agree, though, that

13

Colorado law is binding on the federal court as to the

14

entitlement to attorney's fees?

15
16

MS. RUSHTON:

As to the entitlement to attorney's

fees, yes, Justice White, but we do --

17

QUESTION:

So it is a substantive rule?

18

MS. RUSHTON:

We're not talking about the

19

entitlement, I don't believe, in this case.

20

about the method of enforcing the entitlement to fees.

21

And I think those are very different questions.

22

QUESTION:

We're talking

So the federal court wouldn't be free

23

to say, well, federal law determines whether attorney's

24

fees are to be allowed?

25

MS. RUSHTON:

No, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I don't believe so.

27

1

But I think the federal court does have the right and, in

2

fact, must exercise the right to protect the integrity of

3

the federal court system in determining how these fees

4

should be processed on appeal.
QUESTION:

5

Or, to put it another way, I suppose,

6

without even mentioning attorney's fees yet, to say the

7

federal law has a right to determine when the judgement

8

is final?

MS. RUSHTON:
yes, Your Honor.

MS. RUSHTON:

QUESTION:

MS. RUSHTON:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

And appealable.

Because that's

15

what we're talking about.

16

talking about here is final for purposes of appeal.

17

The issue of finality that we're

A decision by this Court that attorney's fees

18

are collateral we don't believe would affect the

19

Petitioner's entitlement to fees in any aspect.

20

would leave the right to fees that's present in the

21

Colorado Wage Claim Act intact, but it would allow all

22

litigants who seek those fees to apply definitive,

23

unambiguous rules to determine when the time for appeal

24

begins to run.

25

I think it

Now, following the White, the Circuit courts
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28
1

have taken two divergent approaches to attorney's fees.

2

one adopted by the Tenth Circuit and applied in Cox v. Flood

3

is the collateral or bright line approach.

4

believe that approach has the advantage of doing away with

5

any uncertainty regarding the time for appeal, allowing the

6

prompt entry of judgement, the prompt execution of

7

judgement, and the running of post-judgement interests.

8

It also separates and recognizes what may be ethical

9

problems in an unholy alliance of the merits decisions and

10

the fee questions, involving as they do very different

11

issues and very different considerations for the lawyer and

12

the client.

13

The

And, again, we

If this Court, however, is concerned with the

14

idea of piecemeal litigation to independent appeals several

15

of the circuits have postured that local rules and the

16

adoption of local rules would solve those problems.

17

for instance, that set deadlines for filing attorney's fees

18

applications, that made prompt determination of attorney's

19

fees easy, and perhaps expanded the rules on consolidation

20

of a decision on the merits and appeal of the decision on

21

the merits with the appeal of a decision on attorney's fees

22

in the Circuit courts.

Rules,

23

On the other hand, the ad hoc approach that

24

appears to be advocated by the Petitioner in this case

25

creates a deal of uncertainty.

As the Court's questions

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

29

1

have indicated, there is a concern with further litigation

2

over state law.

3

decision, but each statute in each state would have to be

4

examined to determine whether the right to attorney's fees

5

was integral or collateral and, therefore, when the Appellate

6

time began to run.

7

those cases, such as Bilmar v. IGF Drilling which is a case

8

cited in our brief, where the entitlement to fees arises

9

both under a federal statute and under a state law claim and,

10

therefore, may be subject to different Appellate times and

11

to a very difficult determination, at the least, as to how

12

the attorney's fees were awarded and how they should be

13

appealed.

Not only would each state have to come to a

This would be a particular problem in

14

I think that this case illustrates the problems

15

in the ad hoc approach where we are here before this Court

16

with still a divergent interpretation of what Colorado law

17

says about the attorney's fees entitlement under the

18

Colorado Wage Claim Act.

19

Although the Petitioner has cited several cases

20

to this Court, only that case decided in December of 1987

21

speaks at all to the issues of finality and appealability

22

as they affect attorney's fees.

23

reflect entirely different statutes and, perhaps, we would

24

suggest, entirely different considerations about

25

appealability.

The other cases cited

Those are the problems that the adoption of
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30
1

a collateral rule, a bright line rule, that says all

2

attorney's fees are collateral would avoid.

3

We believe, however, that regardless of the

4

approach adopted by this Court these fees would be collateral

5

under either of the approaches adopted by the federal court.

6

These are statutory, as distinguished from

7

contractual fees.

8

provision from that which allows damages under the Colorado

9

Wage Claim Act.

10

11

any part of the action on the merits.

in fact, treated as costs by the court and by the parties

to this case.

IS

16

merits, and his right to those fees was supported in his

17

memorandum supporting attorney's fees as costs.

18

They are found in a separate statutory

They were first raised in Petitioner's bill

Finally, Your Honors, the Petitioner requests

19

that if this Court finds that his attorney's fees request

20

was, indeed, collateral and, therefore, his appeal of the

21

judgement on the merits was untimely that any decision of

22

this Court be applied perspectively only.

23

First, we believe this Court has already spoken

24

in the case of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company v, Risjord

25

that because when a court lacks discretion to even hear the
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

31

1

issue, as the Tenth Circuit did to hear the untimely appeal

2

on the merits, that ruling can never be made perspective

3

only.

4

But if, in fact, this Court does consider the

5

question of prospectivity, we believe that the equities

6

justifying an exception to the rule on retroactivity are not

7

present here.

8

this Court nor in the Tenth Circuit, being clearly

9

foreshadowed by this Court's decision in White v.

10

New Hampshire and the Tenth Circuit's determination in

11

Cox v. Flood.

12

This is not a matter of first impression in

The application of this rule to the Petitioner

13

herein doesn't retard the purposes behind the rule and there

14

clearly is no reliance by the Petitioner on this position,

15

when throughout the course of the litigation he has treated

16

these attorney's fees as costs.

17

In conclusion, we would urge that this Court

18

adopt a rule that finds that fees are collateral to a

19

judgement on the merits and that the time for filing a

20

notice of appeal is thirty days from the entry of the

21

judgement on the merits regardless of the pendancy of

22

an attorney's fees request.

23

We believe that decision can be reached whether

24

this Court decides that attorney's fees are costs pursuant

25

to Rule 58 or whether they are collateral because of their
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

32

separate and independent nature.

2

would promote the policies of this Court and establish

3

uniform federal rules for processing appeals, and is the

4

only rule that is truly fair to litigants in the federal

5

court system.

We believe that that rule
