ORAL ARGUMENT BY BENTON MUSSLEWHITE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the court:
At the outset I would like to try to articulate what

1.1

I think is the crucial issue here, and that is where simply

12

stated a federal court has dismissed a case on grounds of forum

13

non conveniens and the Plaintiffs refiled in the state court;

14

whether or not that federal court can then enjoin the state

15

court despite the provisions of the anti-injunction statute?

16

Now having said that, I'd like to go into a little

17

detail about the procedural facts involved here, because I

18

think they're important.

19

was not decided in the original federal court action in the

20

light of this Court's decision in Atlantic Railway.

21

And particularly important for what

After the case was dismissed on grounds of forum non

22

conveniens by the initial federal court and suit was filed in

23

the state court, the Respondents removed to the federal court;

24

the federal court, though, requested to do so by the

25

Petitioners, to remand the case; and refused to remand; and

Heritage

3
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

again dismissed the case; and that was appealed; and the Fifth

2

Circuit reversed that decision and ordered that the case be

3

remanded.

4

Once the case was remanded to the state court, the

5

respondents then went to the federal court in a new suit and

6

got the permanent injunction, which is the basis of this

7

hearing here.
Now, in the mean time, that went up on appeal to the

8
9

Fifth Circuit; and while that was being done, there was another

10

case proceeding out on the West Coast in the Ninth Circuit,

11

called the Zipfel case, and the Fifth Circuit in this case, in

12

a split decision held, that the injunction was proper under the

13

relitigation exception, apparently -- that's the way I read the

14

decision -- because even though there was a difference between

15

the Texas forum non conveniens law and the federal forum non

16

conveniens law, the federal forum non conveniens doctrine pre­

17

empted the state doctrine; and therefore, there was the basis

18

for entering -- issuing, the injunction.

19

Judge Reavley dissented and held that on the basis of

20

Atlantic Coast Line and other Supreme Court decisions that that

21

was not a proper decision, and those matters should be left to

22

the state courts to decide; and that the injunction was not

23

proper.

24
25

His dissent agreed almost foursquare with the
unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit in the Zipfel case

4

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

which held that in a similar situation -- also a maritime case,

2

the injunction was improper.

3

Having said that, I'd like to as I said a moment ago,

4

to point out what was not decided in the original federal court

5

action:

6

Respondents and some of the amici briefs, that the case could

7

not be tried anywhere in the United States; nor was it decided

8

that it had to be tried in Singapore.

9

it was not decided that, as contended by -- the

What was simply decided was that federal court would

10

not accept a case on grounds of forum non conveniens; that that

11

federal court did not feel that it was a convenient forum for

12

the case[; and imposed conditions so that, if the Plaintiffs

13

wanted to, they could go to Singapore and have the case

14

adjudicated there.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

It was decided that Singapore law would

apply, though wasn't it?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

It was decided that American law

18

would not apply, and the court's discussion of that indicated

19

that it felt Singapore law should apply.

20
21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Wasn't there in the attempted state action

a claim under state law filed?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

There was a contention under state

law, the state wrongful death act.
QUESTION:

Do you concede that that, at least, could

be enjoined?

5

1

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

2

QUESTION:

3

Why not?

That was decided by the federal

court.

4
5

No, Your Honor, I don't because --

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

It was dismissed under forum non

conveniens, that state law.
QUESTION:

6

But the necessary predicate of that forum

7

non conveniens decision was the determination that the

8

governing substantive law was not the law of the United States.
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

9
10

Was not that a federal maritime

law?

11

QUESTION:

Just federal?

12

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Just federal.

There was no

13

decision that the state — they dismissed the state law claims

14

on the grounds of forum non conveniens.

15

that state law could not apply.
QUESTION:

16
17

They did not decide

Didn't they say that Singapore law

governed?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

18

The court indicated that American

19

federal maritime law did not apply, and in so-doing indicated

20

that it felt like the foreign law would apply.

21

decision, but it did not --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

24
25

That was the

It did say that foreign law applied?
That is the essence of the

decision.
QUESTION:

If that's the essence of the decision, why

6

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

can't they enjoin the bringing of an action under the law of

2

any of the United States?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

3

Well, because we're getting into

4

the forum non conveniens issue as it relates to choice of law,

5

and really what we have here is a forum non conveniens issue

6

and not choice of law.
Certainly the foreign law claims were not

7
8

adjudicated.

9

which allows a plaintiff to adjudicate its rights under foreign

10

That is, Texas has a statute, Justice Scalia,

laws .
QUESTION:

11

I'm not talking about that now.

I'm just

12

talking about trying to bring an action saying after the

13

federal court said Singapore law applies; that's all been

14

fought out; it's been litigated; it's been decided; then you

15

try it again in state court, and we think state law should

16

govern.

17

Federal court just said no.

18

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

I would next concede that

19

Defendants, or the Respondents in the state court action

20

contend that that was collateral estoppel or directly estopped

21

by the determination by the federal court, the first federal

22

court, that Singapore law applied; and by implicitly rejecting

23

the state law claim.

24
25

QUESTION:

And if that's so, the federal court could,

if the other requirements of the discretionary judgment are

Heritage

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

met, could enjoin the bringing of that claim that is already

2

determined by the federal court?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

3

No, Your Honor.

I would have to

4

disagree on that. I do not believe that the anti-injunction

5

statute as construed by this Court in a number of cases,

6

beginning with Atlantic Coast Line to Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend,

7

and as recently as Parsons Steel.

8

that doctrine a collateral estoppel or direct estoppel issue is

9

the subject of an injunction of a relitigation statute.

10

I do not believe that under

Only cases as fully adjudicated upon the merits, as a

11

revisors notes say, can be the basis of the injunction under

12

2283, and that's what is the bottom line here, that there are

13

certain collateral estoppel issues that can probably be

14

successfully asserted in the state court action, which is where

15

this belongs now.

16

might amount to direct estoppel or collateral estoppel, which

17

could be the basis of an injunction under the relitigation

18

section.

But there are not issues, even though they

1
19

QUESTION:

I suppose you are saying that, if there is

20

an estoppel, that claim should be first made in the state

21

court?

22

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

23

QUESTION:

That's one thing.

Wouldn't you think, if the issue has been

24

decided in the federal — if Singapore law applies, certainly

25

Texas can't apply it's wrongful death statute?

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:
QUESTION:

That would be true.

All right, so when the federal claims were

dismissed in the state court, and you didn't complain about
that.
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

The federal claims were dismissed;

that was appealed but we lost.
QUESTION:

So that just leaves the Texas claim.

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:
Honor.

And the foreign law claims, Your

Texas has a statute that allows the Plaintiffs to bring

the foreign law claims in the Texas courts and have those
adjudicated.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, the defendants in the

Texas courts could claim collateral estoppel?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

I think there is no question they

could claim it.
QUESTION:

Would they win?

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

I would have to say that on the

basis of the fact that the federal court, if the federal court
decision is that clear -- and I do not think it is that clear,
Justice Scalia -- there is no question there is intimations in
that federal court judgment to the effect that they believe
Singapore law should apply, and not American.
QUESTION:

All right, so if the Texas courts rejected

that collateral estoppel claim, it would come on up through the
state courts and could get here?

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

That's right, Justice White.

I

think that is -QUESTION:

You think the estoppel claim should win in

the state court, if it was made?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Knowing the background of this case

6

in this particular case, I do not think it should win because

7

the court did not directly address that issue, even though, as

8

I conceded to Justice Scalia, the first federal court did not

9

say "We're now going to decide whether Texas' wrongful death

10

statute will apply to these claims."

11

federal maritime law doesn't apply, and the reason we don't

12

think federal maritime law applies is because it appears to us

13

that the federal law should apply.

14

QUESTION:

It just simply said

But you say whether the collateral

15

estoppel claim would win or lose would not be the basis for an

16

injunction under the Anti-Injunction Act?

17

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Exactly, Your Honor.

In your

18

decision, in your opinion in Vendo v. Lectro-vend, you

19

indicated that we should look to the pre Toucey cases because

20

of the revisors notes refers to those cases when the 1948

21

amendment was enacted.

22

And in looking at those cases and I read every one of

23

them, there's not a single case that did not involve a complete

24

adjudication on the merits of the case.

25

As a matter of fact, Justice Read, in his dissent

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

referred to the complete adjudications.

2

QUESTION:

3

the federal claims?

Why didn't you object to the dismissal of

4

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

5

QUESTION:

6

Well, I know.

We lost, Your Honor.

Weren't you -- was that

dismissal correct?

7
8

Well, we did.

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:
the law.

I don't agree with it, but it based

It's the law of the case.
QUESTION:

If the federal court dismissed them

10

because there wasn't any

11

Singapore law applied?

--

12

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

13

QUESTION:

couldn't be a federal claim if

That's true if federal —

It's like a motion -- you dismiss for

14

failure to state a cause of action.

15

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

That could be construed, under

16

Romero.

17

that, when you find that federal maritime law does not apply,

18

then it could properly be a dismissal for failure to state a

1

claim.

20
21
22

Romero indicates that that's the way you construe

QUESTION:

And you don't think that would be -- you

think you can retry that out in a state court?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Well, the reason it couldn't be a

23

complete -- they didn't solve all the problems, Justice, we had

24

the other claims there.

25

QUESTION:

I know, but how about the federal claims?

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Couldn't the federal court enjoin the retrial or attempted

2

retrial of the federal claims in the state court?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

3

Your Honor, I submit that they

4

could not.

5

White, going into the state court, raising the collateral

6

estoppel or direct estoppel, as to the federal claims, I think

7

the Respondents would be successful.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

I think that they would be successful, Justice

We concede.

Just like they would be on the state

claims?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Well, Your Honor, I would disagree

11

on the state claim, there is a considerably more serious

12

question there I concede because it was plead.

13

was not plead in the original federal court claim, so I don't

14

think that there is any question that there is no estoppel,

15

direct, collateral, or any other kind of res judicata against

16

the foreign law claims being prosecuted in the state court.

17

QUESTION:

But foreign law

Mr. Musslewhite, is it clear that the

18

federal decision was not a decision on the merits with regard

19

to the state claim and the federal law claim?

20

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

It was a decision on the merits

21

with regard to the federal law claim.

22

Act — that the plaintiff was not a seaman. That's a decision

23

on the merits.

24
25

QUESTION:

They held that the Jones

Why isn't the decision that there is no

claim under Texas law, if they made that?

I understand you can

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

test that whether that's clear, but why isn't that equivalently

2

a decision on the merits?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

3

Because it's a decision on the

4

grounds of forum non conveniens.

They dismissed the state law

5

claims and all other claims other than the federal maritime law

6

claims on the forum non conveniens, Your Honor, without

7

prejudice.

8

be a decision on the merits as I see it; and certainly it's not

9

the basis of an injunction under 2283.

The Order says "without prejudice."

So it cannot

It does not constitute

10

that kind of an order that can be subject to a relitigation

11

exception injunction.

12

At any event, what else was not decided in the case

13

below was, and this is very important when we read Atlantic

14

Coast Line, that the pre-emption question was not raised or

15

decided in the federal court action.

16

Moreover, the state law forum non conveniens law,

17

that is, what law would apply and what is a state law and how

18

it would apply in this particular case, and whether or not the

19

case would be appropriately dismissed on the grounds of forum

20

non conveniens under state law was not raised or decided in the

21

federal court action, the first original federal court action.

22

So that, when you read Atlantic Coast Line, the

23

bottom line to all of it is, is that Atlantic Coast Line, as I

24

respectfully read it, says, that unless issues are actually

25

raised, cannot form the basis of the injunction on the basis of

Heritage

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the relitigation section.

2

raise, as occurred in Atlantic Coast Line, the pre-emption

3

question was not raised there; for the majority, the court held

4

that the injunction was not proper; and the same thing would

5

apply here.
And I think Atlantic Coast Line in that regard is

6

7

pretty well dispositive of that issue.
Even if pre-emption could be the basis, and I say

8
9

So these issues, not having been

that even if a pre-emption had been raised, I don't think pre­

10

emption is the kind of thing when you read three decisions,

11

that would be Vendo, Atlantic Coast Line, and Amalgamated

12

Clothing Works.

13

about, and Chief Justice Rehnquist in his opinion in Vendo,

14

said that whenever you have the question of pre-emption, or

15

federal interest versus the Anti-Injunction statute, that

16

federal interest pre-emption question must give way.

17

will not sit and balance those matters; they'll leave it to

18

Congress.

19

All three of those cases speak very strongly

The Court

And therefore, as stated in Atlantic Coast Line, pre­

20

emption is not one of the exceptions to the anti-injunction

21

statute, so that I think the Respondents are misplaced in

22

trying to contend, as was Judge Gee in the Fifth Circuit that,

23

on the basis of pre-emption, an injunction can issue.

24

it's clearly contrary to those three decisions.

25

QUESTION:

What do you mean by "pre-emption?"

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

I think

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

1

Well, the Respondents have

2

contended, Justice White, that they concede there is a

3

difference between the federal forum non conveniens law and the

4

state forum non conveniens law, but that the reason that an

5

injunction can issue is because the federal forum non

6

conveniens law, such as the maritime case, pre-empts the state

7

forum non conveniens law.

8

issue.

And that therefore an injunction can

And I'm saying that --

9

QUESTION:

So you think that -- is that different

10

than talking about estoppel?

11

judicata?
MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

12

Collateral estoppel, or res

It's different, yes sir, it is.

13

think that Chief Judge Brown of the Fifth Circuit says pre­

14

emption does not equal res judicata.

15

saying is they can't bootstrap themselves into a res judicata

16

type of situation which would justify an injunction under the

17

relitigation section using the doctrine of pre-emption.

18
19

It's just -- what I'm

And that's stated very foursquare by this Court on
various occasions.
So I'm saying that, even if they had raised the issue

20
21

exemption, the issue of pre-emption being the focal point of

22

how they try to justify this injunction, this injunction must

23

fall.

24
25

I

Now even if they had -- if the pre-emption doctrine
could be the basis of an injunction in other cases, and it

15

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

could possibly have been in Atlantic Coast Line, it certainly

2

could not be in a forum non conveniens case.

3

reason for this:

4

And there is a

The main reason is that the test laid down for both

5

the second and third exception to the Anti-Injunction statute,

6

being in the second, in aid of jurisdiction; and the third

7

being the relitigation exception, or to effectuate and preserve

8

a judgment — is that the, in order for the injunction to be

9

justified, the action in the state court must in some way

10

interfere with the adjudication by the federal court?

11

"impair," as I believe the term was used, "impair the

12

adjudication" by the federal courts.

13

Must

It's hard for me to see how the state court action in

14

this case could impair the federal court in adjudication of

15

this matter when the federal court says we don't want to

16

adjudicate it.

17

it on grounds of forum non conveniens, and by using the test

18

that was laid down, and I believe it was Chief Justice

19

Rehnquist in the Vendo case said that test applies to both the

20

second and third exception; and this was also discussed in

21

Atlantic Coast Line.

22

We refuse to adjudicate it.

We're dismissing

That being the test, I don't see how any injunction

23

could be justified in this case because there is nothing in the

24

state court action now that the federal court has said we don't

25

want to adjudicate this case; how it could be said that the

16

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

1

state court action could in any way impair the right of the

2

power of the federal court to adjudicate a case it doesn't want

3

to adjudicate?

4

So also, we believe that the doctrine itself, when

5

you look at the Supreme Court cases, this Court's cases on

6

forum non conveniens.

7

v. Mayfield and Parsons v. Chesapeake.

8

9

And I'm speaking primarily of Missouri

Missouri v. Mayfield is a very important case, in my
opinion; the Respondents try to downplay it.

And it was an

10

FELA case, not a maritime case; and it was not a 2283 case,

11

Anti-Injunction case.

12

But what this Court held in Missouri v. Mayfield was

13

that a state court has the right to have a doctrine of forum

14

non conveniens if it wants to; it has a right not to have a

15

doctrine of forum non conveniens if it wants to -- which may

16

very well be the Texas situation under it's open forum statute;

17

or it may have one and it's criteria may differ from the

18

federal criteria.

19

QUESTION:

But don't you read Judge Gee's opinion --

20

which I realize you are challenging, as saying that in maritime

21

cases such as this, a state doesn't have the latitude that it

22

might have in an FELA case, to have its own forum non

23

conveniens doctrine?

24
25

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

Well Your Honor, I go right to

Justice O'Connor's opinion in Talentire, and you talk about the

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

savings to suitor clause, and I just do not believe and see

2

that there is any way that there can be a pre-emption under

3

uniformity or whatever, a reverse-Erie, of a forum non

4

conveniens determination.

5

The Supreme Court, in describing what a forum non

6

conveniens determination is in Missouri v. Mayfield and Parsons

7

v. Chesapeake, has indicated quite clearly that each court has

8

a right to decide what that doctrine is and decide it itself.

9

Now, all the cases I have read on the maritime pre­

10

emption, Your Honor, have dealt with substantive rights, and

11

Justice O'Connor has made that statement at least about four or

12

five times in that opinion in Talentire.

13

that what this Court held in Talentire was that the savings to

And it seems to me

The right to the jurisdiction; the concurrent

And if you were to agree with the Respondents in this

case, the savings to suitor clause would be wholly nullified,

19

because Talentire said that the law, the law of the state, the

20

substantive law of the state, must give way to the substantive

21

law of the federal maritime law, and I can understand that.

22

But there's nothing in Talentire and there's nothing

in any of the uniformity and pre-emption cases that indicates

that a procedural doctrine like forum non conveniens can be the

QUESTION:

9

MR. MUSSLEWHITE:

10

Those are two both different points.
I understand.

Also, another reason that the forum non conveniens

11

doctrine is not the kind of a doctrine that can be either pre­

12

empted because it's not substantive, or is not the kind of a

13

doctrine that can be the basis of an injunction under the

14

relitigation exception is, if you read this Court's decisions

15

in Piper v. Reyno and Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, we concede that this

16

doctrine is a discretionary doctrine; is one that says,

American traditional blue-water vessel was there temporarily;

this vessel to assist in repairs and was killed when a spindle

Your Honor, that's for the Texas

the opinion, it appears based on what the Supreme Court of
Texas commented in Katz v. Chevron that its intent is to allow
its iji personam jurisdiction to allow the matter to proceed
through the Texas courts even though it may be on the basis of
foreign law.

Mr. Musslewhite, I'm trying to understand

what your contention with regard to the collateral estoppel

MR. COONEY:

-- in this context a state court

handling a maritime matter is acting pursuant to a savings to
suitors clause, and is therefore bound by what has been
referred to as the "reverse-Erie" doctrine or the 'uniformity"
doctrine.
The second thing is, I think what has developed in
