PROCEEDINGS

2

(10:11a.m.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

this morning in No. 87-519, Gary Maynard v. William Cartwright.
Ms. Dickerson, you may proceed whenever you are

5

ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN S. DICKERSON
MS. DICKERSON:

8
9
10

We'll hear argument first

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court is whether the United

11

States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit applied the

12

principle of Godfrey v. Georgia too restrictively when it

13

invalidated the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals

14

determination and interpretation that the murder of Hugh Riddle

15

was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.

&
16
17

capital sentencer's discretion must be channeled by clear and

18

objective standards.

19

by its ruling, applied that principle in a manner that

20

affectively requires a finding of serious physical abuse prior

21

to a finding of this particular statutory aggravating

22

circumstance.

23

9

Godfrey, in the plurality opinion, stated that the

The State submits that the Tenth Circuit,

It is our position that physical abuse to the victim

24

is not a necessary element of a constitutional interpretation

25

of this circumstances, and that, moreover, the jury's

3
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
^

2

discretion was channeled appropriately in this case.
QUESTION:

Ms. Dickerson, have the appellate courts

3

in Oklahoma since this court was decided, specifically I think

4

in the Stouffer case and the Brown case, recently adopted the

5

Tenth Circuit's view of the requirements for narrowing the

6

especially heinous, aggravating circumstance?

7

MS. DICKERSON:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

As a direct

8

result of the Maynard decision, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

9

Appeals, less than 40 days after the en banc pronouncement,

10
11

narrowed the interpretation.
The State's position would be that that narrowing was

12

an accent to the current status of interpretation of federal

13

constitutional law.

14

QUESTION:

Was that decision, those decisions a

m

15
16

0

matter based on both state and federal law, do you think?
MS. DICKERSON:

No, Your Honor.

Our interpretation

17

would be that they were solely premised upon federal

18

constitutional law.

19

refer only to Maynard v. Cartwright and to the prior opinions

20

of this Court.

All of the citations in the Stouffer case

21

QUESTION:

What do those opinions do to your case?

22

MS. DICKERSON:

Justice Blackmun, we would contend

23

that jurisdiction is still appropriate with this Court, and

24

that it is the ultimate decision of this Court to determine, as

25

a matter of federal constitutional law, whether or not a state

4
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

is limited to a finding of serious physical abuse.
QUESTION:

2

In other words, you are taking the

3

position that the Tenth Circuit, and it was unanimous wasn't

4

it?

5

MS. DICKERSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. DICKERSON:

8

Misinterpreted our decisions here?
Yes, Your Honor, it is our

contention.
QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

You are swimming upstream, aren't you,

with an en banc case?
MS. DICKERSON:

11

In Godfrey, there was a dissent which

12

indicated that psychological torture could be used as a measure

13

of determining whether or not that --

14

QUESTION:

That was a dissent, wasn't it?

15

MS. DICKERSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. DICKERSON:

%

18

I don't believe it's necessary,

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds very much, to me, like it

would be necessary to reach the result you are asking for.

21

How do you distinguish Godfrey?

22

MS. DICKERSON:

23

25

The distinctions in Godfrey are

that --

24

ยง

Are you asking us to overrule Godfrey?

Justice O'Connor, to overrule --

19
20

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Other than by reliance upon the dissenting

opinion.

^

2

situation in which the killer had immediately prior to the

3

killing engaged in a heated conversation with this estranged

4

wife, proceeded immediately to the same, shot his wife and

5

killed here, and then proceeded to shoot and kill the mother-

6

in-law.
In Godfrey, only a portion of the statutory langauge

7
8

of the (b)(7) subsection circumstance was given.

9

case, the entire language of the especially heinous, atrocious,

10

And in our

or cruel circumstance was given.
Additionally, in Godfrey, there was no further

11
12

definitional instruction given to the jury.

13

in Instruction No. 16, which is found at Page 12 of the joint

14

appendix, definitions were given which provided guidance to the

15

jury in this instance.

And in our case,

At the outset I would note that this Court has held

16
17

that qualifying language used in an instruction can render

18

acceptable and appropriate an instruction which might otherwise

19

be infirm.

20

In the case of California v. Brown, this Court

21

approved of the giving on an anti-sympathy instruction during

22

the capital sentencing stage of a trial due to the fact that

23

the instruction cautioned against the use of mere sympathy as

24

opposed to sympathy alone.

25

i

In Godfrey, Godfrey was a domestic

Instruction No. 16 defines the terms apart from

6

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

^

1

"especially".

However, the State would note initially that the

2

use of the word "especially" heinous, atrocious, or cruel

3

serves to channel and qualify those types of murders which are

4

more evil than any murder which is certainly heinous,

5

atrocious, or cruel.
In addition, the instructions given provided that

6
7

heinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil.

8

means outrageously wicked and vile.

9

or designed to inflict a high degree of pain, utter

10

Atrocious

And cruel means pitiless

indifference to or enjoyment of the suffering of others.
These instruction and definitions were given in the

11
12

disjunctive term and provided further guidance which was not

13

provided to the jury in the Godfrey case.
As well in Godfrey, there was no other aggravating

14
k

15

circumstances found, and in this instance, a second aggravating

16

circumstance of great risk of death to more than one person was

17

found.
Addressing specifically the definitions that were

18

9

19

given, heinous and atrocious turn specifically to consideration

20

of the killer's attitude and the manner of the killing.

21

because the discretion was channeled by use of definitions, and

22

because the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals then assessed

23

the definitions and the application of the facts to those

24

definitions, the State submits that sufficient narrowing

25

occurred.

7
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And

r

1

In this case, the heinousness and atrocity of the

2

crime was evidenced by Defendant Cartwright's intent to get

3

even with the Riddles.

4

his grudge, and he had told two witnesses that he intended to

5

get even with the Riddles.
As pointed out in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

6
7

Appeals' opinion, the Defendant either lay in wait our returned

8

under cover of darkness to commit his acts against the Riddles.
Additionally, he disconnected the phone.

9

He provided

10

a note on the front door of the home to conceal his deeds.

11

engaged in a larceny attempt, and rather than turn himself into

12

the authorities immediately upon completion of the crime, as

13

did the defendant in Godfrey, he fled the scene once the

14

authorities arrived on the scene, and turned himself in only

15

two days later at the convincing of his family members.
QUESTION:

16
17

or cruel?

He

What is so especially atrocious, heinous

It sounds like a routine murder to me.
MS. DICKERSON:

18

Justice Scalia, we would contend that

19

this intent, this laying in wait, this return under cover of

20

darkness, all of the items I've mentioned previously, as well

21

as the cruelty inflicted by virtue of the fact that there were

22

psychological torture experienced by Mr. Riddle, although he

23

died instantly, which would set this murder apart from other

24

murders.

25

I

He had spent over four months harboring

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see the latter.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I can see

how there was a lot of psychological suffering by Mrs. Riddle,

2

and I can see that his treatment of Mrs. Riddle was quite

3

atrocious, slitting her throat and so forth.

4

dispatched Mr. Riddle with one blast of his shotgun.
MS. DICKERSON:

5

I think it is appropriate to put the

6

entire crime scenario in perspective in that the Riddles had

7

been in the living room.

8

hall, was confronted by Defendant Cartwright; was shot once;

9

fell to the floor; was shot again, and importantly, that second

Mrs. Riddle arose to go into the

10

shot Defendant Cartwright did not shoot her in the chest or in

11

the head where she would be rendered dead instantly, but left

12

her there to suffer such that Mr. Riddle would then in turn

13

hear his wife suffering in the hall, and then immediately was

14

confronted by Defendant Cartwright.
The Defendant fired two shots at Mr. Cartwright,

15
16

hitting him once in the chest and killing him instantly at that

17

point, but there was a period of psychological torture

18

involved.

19

the prosecutor conceded that there was no torture, in this

20

instance, in the closing remarks of the prosecutor at Page 633

21

of the transcript, the prosecutor noted that Mr. Riddle must

22

have endured some psychological trauma from having heard his

23

wife injured in the next room immediately prior to being killed

24

himself.

25

f

But he just

And, in fact, unlike the situation in Godfrey where

QUESTION:

Did the instructions here allow the jury

to consider the atrociousness or heinousness of the crime as a

2

whole?

3

Riddle that went with the whole thing?

That is, could it take into account the torture of Mrs.

4

MS. DICKERSON:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we would --

Do you think that that's constitutionally

6

permissible under our decision; that we can look at the whole

7

crime and not just the murder of Mr. Riddle alone?

8

MS. DICKERSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

As long ago as

9

Gregg v. Georgia, this Court indicated that the circumstances

10

of the crime were appropriate for consideration by this Court

11

in assessing the validity of a death penalty.

12

Just O'Connor, in her special concurrence to the

13

California v. Brown opinion, indicated that validity of the

14

death sentence must reflect a reasoned moral response to the

15

defendant's background, character and crime.

16

crime in this instance was the inflicting of pain and suffering

17

that he inflicted on Mrs. Riddle.

k

18

Well, that seems to me a much stronger

19

part of your case than whatever happened to Mr. Riddle who was

20

dead quite soon.

In all fairness, the first shot may

have been intended to have been aimed at another part of her

body, but there was some evidence that she deflected the gun

2

shot to her leg in the first instance.

4

in the chest or the head where she certainly would have died

5

instantly.

6

But clearly, he shot

It is appropriate to consider the character of the

7

Defendant in this case, and we are looking in this particular

8

circumstance to see the evil character of a defendant.

9

certainly the acts of this particular Defendant are more evil.

And

10

In connection with your question, Justice Scalia, I

11

would note that in the prior opinion of the three judge panel

12

of the Tenth Circuit prior to the reversal en bach, Judge

13

Tacha, who wrote the en banc decision, validated the existence

14

of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel finding upon the

15

existence of suffering to Mrs. Riddle.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask about Mrs. Riddle?

Is it your

17

understanding of the facts that the shooting of Mrs. Riddle,

18

the Defendant was trying to kill her when he shot her?

19

MS. DICKERSON:

I would assume that his ultimate

20

intention were to kill her in that he did return to the bedroom

21

where she had managed to try to find the telephone working, he

22

did slit her throat and stab her in the abdomen rather than

23

assist her upon her plea for help.

24
25

QUESTION:

The question I suppose I am wrestling

with, because I have the same concern Justice Scalia does,

11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

^

1

should one view the attack on Mrs. Riddle as an attempt to

2

torture her and cause her to suffer unnecessary pain before she

3

would die, or was it just that he was kind of bungling the job

4

of trying to kill her?

5

fatal shot, and he failed to kill her by stabbing here, but he

6

wasn't just trying to inflict pain that would not result in

7

death.

He hit her legs instead of shooting a

8

What position did the State take at the trial?

9

MS. DICKERSON:

Justice Stevens, I think it would be

10

a fair characterization of the evidence that he intended not

11

only that Mrs. Riddle endure some torture, but that Mr. Riddle

12

endure torture as it related to the suffering of Mrs. Riddle as

13

well prior to the time that he did finally do what he thought

14

would in fact kill her.
QUESTION:

15

Did the prosecutor's closing argument

16

explain why the State thought this was cruel, unusual and

17

atrocious?

18

MS. DICKERSON:

Not to the extent relied upon on

19

review by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, but there was

20

reference made to the torture, the psychological trauma to

21

which Mr. Riddle had been exposed.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. DICKERSON:

24

There was also a lengthy discussion as to the

25

Which Mr. Riddle had suffered, yes.
Yes, Your Honor.

circumstances of Mrs. Riddle's torture, because conjointly with

12

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the trying for murder, there was a count of shooting with

2

intent to kill.
QUESTION:

3
4

the law.

5

clear as we make them in our hypothetical question, but assume

6

it was perfectly clear that the Defendant had tried to kill

7

Mrs. Riddle as promptly and efficiently as he could, but he

8

missed and he was just a bungler and caused her to suffer the

9

equivalent of the same kind of physical torture that if he was

10

Assume the facts were clear, and they never are as

just trying to do.

11

Would that satisfy the aggravating circumstance?

12

MS. DICKERSON:

In that instance, I believe it would

13

in that there would be actual suffering, and the end result,

14

the end circumstance of the crime would be that there would be

15

some suffering endured there such that the jury could rely upon

16

a finding of cruelty.

17

QUESTION:

So that you don't focus really on the

18

mental state of the Defendant, but rather, on the pain suffered

19

by the victim.

20

deliberately a malicious sort of person or just a bungler.

21

That really wouldn't make any difference.

22

It really doesn't matter whether he was

MS. DICKERSON:

Well, Justice Stevens, I think our

23

approach would validate a finding of looking at the killer's

24

attitude as well as the circumstances of the crime.

25

*

What would your view if -- as a matter of

QUESTION:

But you don't have to look at it is what I

13
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

am asking, in your view.

The element doesn't focus on the

Defendant's mental state, in your -- it focuses, rather, on the
impact of the hardship on the victim.
MS. DICKERSON:
QUESTION:

I would think it could focus on both.

Either one would be sufficient.

MS. DICKERSON:

I wouldn't say that one would be

mutually exclusive of the other.

And I think that that's what

the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals had done is allow all of
the circumstances of the crime as well as the killer's attitude
to come into play based upon previous holdings of this Court
which would validate looking at the circumstances of the crime
and the killer's attitude.
QUESTION:

Ms. Dickerson, I would like to come back

to Justice Stevens's question about specifically whether the
jury was asked to take into account the suffering that the wife
endured.
Was that part of the prosecution's argument, that
this was heinous and atrocious because of the torture of the
wife; was that part of the State's case?
MS. DICKERSON:

It was part of the general closing

argument made to the jury; yes, Your Honor.

It was not

emphasized to the great degree that it might have been, but it
was part of the closing argument.
QUESTION:

And the whole thing went to the jury

together, not just the killing of the husband, but the whole

14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

incident, including the wounding of the wife?
MS. DICKERSON:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Both

were tried simultaneously.
QUESTION:

Could I bring you back to your comment

before the last series of questions?
You made a reference to the panel opinion, and I
didn't quite follow you there.

What is the significance of the

panel opinion by Judge Tacha?
MS. DICKERSON:

I believe, Justice Blackmun, I was

trying to indicate that prior to the panel opinion, prior to
the en banc opinion the three judge panel opinion involved an
opinion by Judge Tacha that the circumstances surrounding the
torture and abuse to Mrs. Riddle could appropriately be used to
assess -QUESTION:

But wasn't that vacated by the en banc

opinion?
MS. DICKERSON:
QUESTION:

Therefore, what significance is it?

MS. DICKERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

I has no precedential value.

Then I wonder why you mention it.

MS. DICKERSON:

I mention it merely in connection of

the fact that at least at one time one judge was of the opinion
that that information could be used.
QUESTION:

But he is the same judge who wrote the en

banc opinion.

15
Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MS. DICKERSON:

2

QUESTION:

It is, Your Honor.

Ms. Dickerson, the Oklahoma Court of

3

Criminal Appeals, the new standard, as I understand their

4

opinion, is that only where there is evidence that the death of

5

the murder victim was preceded by torture or serious physical

6

abuse.
Now, that was not something prescribed by the Tenth

7
8

Circuit, was it?
MS. DICKERSON:

9

The holding of the Tenth Circuit did

10

not explicitly state that would be the only constitutional

11

interpretation.

12

effectively mandated that particular interpretation by virtue

13

of certain language in the en banc opinion.

However, the State's position is that it

QUESTION:

14

I gather all that the Tenth Circuit did

15

really was to say that, as a whole, the past construction of

16

the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating

17

circumstance was unconstitutionally vague; wasn't that it?

18

MS. DICKERSON:

19

QUESTION:

And the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed

20

that, yes, it was.

21

standard; is that a --

22
23

And then they established this new

MS. DICKERSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Our position is

that the -QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, Justice Brennan.

Yes, tell me, what does that do to your

case?

16
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
^

that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals merely responded to

3

and assented to the current status of federal constitutional

4

law as interpreted by the Tenth Circuit.

5

The en banc opinion in the Maynard v. Cartwright case

6

indicated that initially the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals

7

in Eddings had referred to, and it had expressly adopted the

8

profit standard, but had digressed from that standard.

9

was this digression from that standard which caused the Tenth

11

And it

Circuit consternation and concern.
And our position would be that the digression from

12

that standard was not an unconstitutional digression, but was a

13

digression which would allow and account for the circumstances

14

of the crime and the killer's attitude to be reflected in a

15

finding of this particular circumstance that the murder was

16

more evil than your ordinary murder situation.

17

QUESTION:

But I gather were this case to come before

18

the Court of Criminal Appeals at this time, that standard would

19

say that the death penalty could not be imposed in this case.

20

MS. DICKERSON:

Justice Brennan, our argument would

21

be that it could be due to the fact that psychological torture

22

took place.

23

9

I think the issue remains with us in

I would like to respond to, and hopefully clarify.

2

Just Scalia, you inquired with regard to whether or

not the jury was asked to take into consideration the suffering

4

of Ms. Riddle in its consideration of the heinous, atrocious,

5

or cruel aggravating circumstance.
The portion of the State argument which does relate

6
7

to this aggravating circumstance appears in the Joint Appendix,

8

and a reading of that will demonstrate that the State did not

opinion concurring with the initial decision by the panel,

14

found that those circumstances, in her opinion, could

15

distinguish this murder from other murders, and noted that it

16

was not clear in her mind whether or not Oklahoma directed the

17

especially heinous circumstance to the suffering of persons

18

other than the murder victim, and that was an issue which we

19

were asked specifically to brief on rehearing before the Tenth

20

Circuit.

21

It was noted that Justice Tacha, in her concurring

And when the Tenth Circuit considered on rehearing

22

the interpretation and construction of this aggravating

23

circumstance in Mr. Cartwright's case, it determined that

24

Oklahoma, that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals had not

adopted a construction of especially heinous, atrocious, or

cruel which provided any standard that guided and limited a

2

jury's discretion to impose death.
QUESTION:

3

Ms. Welch, has the Oklahoma Court of

4

Criminal Appeals adopted a standard now as a matter of state

5

law?
MS. WELCH:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

The Oklahoma court has

adopted a requirement that in order for a murder to be heinous,

8

especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel it must involve torture

9

10

And it's your position that they have made

And considering whether or not the jury's finding met

MS. WELCH:

The State opinion does not take into

consideration the suffering of a surviving victim in

5

determining whether or not the murder was heinous, atrocious or

6

cruel.

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

8

QUESTION:

I think Justice White's point is that the

9

only suffering that could have been incurred by the surviving

10

victim there was psychological suffering, psychological

11

torture.

12
13
14

MS. WELCH:

The surviving victim was shot three times

in the Stouffer case.
QUESTION:

No, I'm sorry.

The only torture imposed

15

upon the dead victim that could have been attributable to the

16

surviving victim was psychological torture.

17

MS. WELCH:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
Right?

So that seems to contradict what

you said earlier that psychological torture is not something

20

that the Oklahoma courts would take into account.

I know in Brown, the victim in Brown

was shot seven times, and it was unclear as to whether or not
the -- when the fatal shot was fired.

And the court found that

for that reason they could not uphold a jury's finding, because
there was no evidence that the victim suffered before she died.
In that case the victim was fleeing from her husband who was
attempting to shoot her, which would indicate that there was at
least that amount of psychological trauma and panic that would

21

the murder victim did not know or was not involved in the

22

specific act that created the great risk of death.

23

that was true -- that has been true in Oklahoma and in other

24

states.

25

In fact,

I think the fact that it could be true does not

32

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

1

validate an application of a vague, unconstitutionally vague

2

and ambiguous circumstance just because some other state might

3

have adopted or because Oklahoma constitutionally could adopt a

4

standard that focused the jury's attention on that aspect of

5

the crime.

6

An example of that is Godfrey.

In Godfrey, the court

7

found that Georgia had abandoned its previous construction of

8

its outrageously and wantonly, vile, aggravating circumstance,

9

and that based upon the langauge of the statute, there was no

10

principled way to distinguish Godfrey from other murders, but

11

it noted that other states had adopted a standard which made

12

the killing of two people an aggravating circumstance that

13

could result in the death penalty.

14

Since Georgia had not adopted that aggravating

15

circumstance, it did not say the death sentence in Mr.

16

Godfrey's case.

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Welch, in Godfrey, the plurality

18

opinion, after having analyzed the legal aspect, said that the

19

facts of that case could not be brought under the outrageously

20

wanton, vile, et cetera.

21

Now the Tenth Circuit's opinion in this case did not

22

track Godfrey in that respect.

23

said it wouldn't decide whether on the facts of this case it

24

could be outrageously wanton or vile.

25

The Tenth Circuit expressly

Why do you suppose the Tenth Circuit refused to opine

33

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

)

2

on that subject when they purported to be following Godfrey?
MS. WELCH:

The Tenth Circuit said that it would not

.J

attempt to determine whether this crime was heinous, atrocious,

4

or cruel, because it didn't see that as its responsibility.

5

In Godfrey, the court was able to say, these facts

6

don't meet Godfrey's -- Georgia's standard because Georgia had

7

adopted a clearly defined standard.

8
9

Oklahoma had not, and if the Tenth Circuit had said
this case can or cannot meet a constitutional interpretation of

10

heinous, atrocious, or cruel, it would in effect have been

11

dictating to the state an interpretation, or at least

12

suggesting to the state an interpretation that it should adopt.

13
14
*

What the Tenth Circuit did was tell the court, you
have not adopted any standard.

We cannot identify any standard

in your construction of this aggravating circumstance that
16

guides or limits a jury's judgment.

17

And under Gregg, and Proffitt, and Godfrey, in order

18

to impose the death sentence, a state must define those crimes

19

for which death can be imposed in a way that obviates

20

standardless sentencing discretion.

21

providing standards, clear and objective standards that provide

22

specific and detailed guidance.

States must do that by

In Brown, the Court of Criminal Appeals specifically
said, we agree with the Tenth Circuit's decision that our past
construction of this circumstance was unconstitutionally vague.
And the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has a history of
disagreeing with decisions of Federal Courts and the Supreme
Court.
And when it has felt -QUESTION:

And vice-versa, I suppose.

MS. WELCH:

Right.

And when it is felt compelled to

follow along with a decision that it disagreed with, it has
been quick to state that.

That is not what happened here.

I believe there was a question asked I believe by
Justice O'Connor earlier about whether or not the Oklahoma
court's decision rested solely upon federal constitutional
grounds.

And if I recall, the response was that it rested on

Cartwright v. Maynard.
Oklahoma did its own analysis of the opinion of
Godfrey, and looked at its previous construction of heinous,
atrocious, or cruel, and said we find that our reliance upon
the terms of the statute in these definitions did not guide the
jury.
QUESTION:

But it was still relying on Godfrey, if

not on Cartwright.
MS. WELCH:

That is correct.

It did rely upon

Godfrey, but it relied upon its analysis of Godfrey, and just

balance the need for uniformity and predictability that is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN S. DICKERSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MS. DICKERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is no dictate in the Constitution of the United
States or in the plurality opinion in Godfrey v. Georgia which
would mandate a requirement of physical abuse prior to the
existence of a finding that the statutory aggravating
circumstance of an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel
existed.
As Justice Stevens pointed out earlier, an argument,
and I would concur that the circumstance can be proven by

inflicted by the victim regardless of whether or not there was
an intent to torture.
In this case, we do have clear objective standards

was cited to in the Proffitt decision.

1

The Proffitt language was approved by this Court.

2

However, the State would submit that Proffitt is not the only

3

constitutional interpretation of this particular aggravating

4

circumstance.

5

It is our position that the Oklahoma Court of

6

Criminal Appeals, in the issue on rehearing in Stouffer, was

7

compelled by what it felt to be the dictates of federal

8

constitutional law to alter its long-time previous opinion, and

9

it did so with great haste in order to avoid refusing to follow

10

11

the current status of federal law.
There is not a subjective standardless approach used

12

in this case.

13

the facts to the crime in this case, as reflected in the

14

opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, indicates

15

that this decision was certainly more objective in assessing

that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel more
