ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL LEE HERTZBERG

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HERTZBERG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

11

W

We'll hear argument next in

The issue in this case is the meaning of the Haskell

12

Amendment.

The Haskell Amendment is found in Section

13

6103(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

14
15

the term, return information, does not include data which is in

16

directly or indirectly a particular taxpayer.

And it provides that

a form which cannot be associated with or otherwise identify,

17

The en banc majority of the Court of Appeals below

18

read a reformulation requirement into the Haskell Amendment,

19

but the term, reformulation, appears nowhere in the plain

20

language of the Statute; appears nowhere in the legislative

21

history of the Statute, indeed, does not even appear in the

22

briefs of the Government below.

23

By reading this reformulation requirement into the

24

Haskell Amendment the Court of Appeals in effect held that data

25

that is in Internal Revenue Service files which cannot be

Heritage

associated with, or identify a particular taxpayer must

2

nonetheless be considered return information and generally

3

nondisclosable in response to Freedom of Information Act

4

requests or otherwise, unless it is also, in addition to

5

nonidentification, reformulated.

6

reformulation standard is that it is not articulated in a very

7

precise way in the opinion below.

8

guidance as to what is meant by reformulation.

9

Court of Appeals en banc majority candidly acknowledge in their

And the problem with this

There is very little
In fact, as the

10

opinion, it was easier for them to say what they felt that the

11

Haskell Amendment did not mean, than to articulate precisely

12

what it did mean.
And as an example of the imprecision, and the

13
14

problems that are raised by this reformulation test, the Court

15

of Appeals never specifies in what original form data must be

16

in in tax files before it can be properly reformulated.

17

dissent noted, there is information in Internal Revenue Service

18

files in every kind of conceivable stage of development, and

19

yet we don't know in what original form it must originate

20

before it can be reformulated.

21

QUESTION:

As the

Well, how about your position, Mr.

22

Hertzberg?

23

But would you say that an individual income tax return should

24

be available if the information that allowed you to identify a

25

taxpayer were redacted?

I realize you disagree with the Court of Appeals.

4

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. HERTZBERG:

1

Your Honor, returns themselves are

2

separately nondisclosable under the statutory scheme.

3

don't believe that is an issue that would arise in that

4

context.

5

and whether that can be identified with a particular taxpayer,

6

that was what Congress' purpose was.

7

So I

We are talking about discreet data return information

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, now where do you and the

8

government differ?

9

should be available, in a kind of a concrete illustration, and

10

11

I mean, what kind of thing do you say

the government says shouldn't be available?
MR. HERTZBERG:

Sure.

Your Honor, we would maintain,

12

and this of course arose in the context of a Freedom of

13

Information Act request, so it's easiest for me to respond in

14

that context.

15

Let us say a Freedom of Information Act request came

16

in and to properly respond to it, some data in the file of a

17

third party taxpayer included some numbers on a piece of paper

18

that were in the file, and that would be somehow comprehended

19

hypothetically within the confines of the Freedom of

20

Information Act request.

21

identifying material, and I will now just give as an example,

22

name, address, or social security number, but by no means the

23

exhaustive list of what could be associated with a taxpayer, if

24

that number were disclosable without any of what I have

25

referred to generically as identifying material, it cannot be

If those numbers divorced from

5

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

3
4

linked with a particular taxpayer.
We would maintain that it would be disclosable if it
came within the term -QUESTION:

So supposing the Freedom of Information

5

Act request was for the number of people who had reported a

6

gross income of $76,855 last year?

7

should be disclosable?

8

9
10
11
12

MR. HERTZBERG:

Now, you would say that

I would, Your Honor, if it could in

no way be linked to a particular taxpayer, of course.
QUESTION:

And that the government should have to

collect that information for you, in effect?
MR. HERTZBERG:

Well, that would turn on whether it

13

was a proper request under the Freedom of Information Act.

14

mean, there are limitations as to what the scope of their

15

search would have to be.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

I

But that's a separate question.

And is it your understanding that the

government would say that is not required to be disclosed?
MR. HERTZBERG:

And in fact, under the terms, yes,

19

yes, Your Honor.

Under the Freedom of Information Act, but I

20

don't want to say, in a broader sense what I'm trying to say, I

21

don't want to overstate it.

22

the Freedom of Information Act that the Government agencies are

23

not required to -search all their files just to come up with

24

some data that is requested.

25

was thinking of when I answered your question.

There is a general principle under

And that is the concept that I

6

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

Let's stay away from the peculiarities of

2

the Freedom of Information Act, and concentrate on the tax

3

aspects.

4

Is it your understanding that the government in this

5

case says that a Freedom of Information Act request for all

6

taxpayers who report a gross income of a particular figure is

7

not disclosable?

8
9

MR. HERTZBERG:

Yes.

Their position, Your Honor, I'm

quite certain is that even if the data that you are implicating

10

in your hypothetical Freedom of Information Act request could

11

not be linked with a specific taxpayer, it would nonetheless

12

not be disclosable unless it were reformulated.

13

back to this reformulation concept, and that's what I am

14

addressing, really.

15

Because this is the whole basis.

See, we come

An additional thing

16

was read into the statute, an additional level of activity, as

17

it were, is required by the government's reading and by the

18

Court's reading of the Statute.

19

enough that the material not identify a taxpayer, or not be

20

associated with a taxpayer, it must in addition be

21

reformulated.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

The Court said it is not

What, to the extent that you can, did the

Court of Appeals mean by it being reformulated?
MR. HERTZBERG:

Well, Your Honor, that is one of the

fundamental problems, here, because they were extremely vague.

to the fact of non-identification, some alteration by the

originally recorded.

6

consist of statistical tabulation or some other form of

7

combination with other data, so as to produce a unitary product

that disguises the origin of its components, as in the tax

money.

10

They said, in addition

I'm quoting, of course, from the Essence

That reformulation will typically, typically

QUESTION:

I would think the Government would surely

11

say the number of people, certain level of income, would be

12

disclosable.

13

You think it would not?

14

MR. HERTZBERG:

I am not sure.

Perhaps, Your Honor -

15
16

QUESTION:

Well, all they do is count.

They count

17

and come up with a number and it doesn't even appear in any

18

piece of paper.

19

They just count it.

MR. HERTZBERG:

Your Honor, then perhaps I

20

misunderstood Chief Justice Rehnquist's question, because I

21

understood him in the hypothetical that he furnished to be

22

asking for the data of that level of income.

23

QUESTION:

But if the question was how many people

24

reported an income of $100,000, you would agree if they just

25

came up with a number?

Heritage

8
Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

MR. HERTZBERG:

1

Just a number, yes.

Yes.

Without

2

requiring any data to be disclosed, any specific data other

3

than the number, I would agree.

4

QUESTION:

Does any example readily occur to you of

5

things like what we're talking about where you think it should

6

be disclosed and the government doesn't, some kind of Concrete

7

case?

8

MR. HERTZBERG:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Well, our case.

Yes.

Yes, that's what I would like to

know.
MR. HERTZBERG:

All right.

In this case, the

12

petitioner made a broad request for information in Internal

13

Revenue Service files which mentioned the petitioner, and the

14

part of the Internal Revenue Service's response, which is

15

implicated by this appeal, was the Internal Revenue Service's

16

refusal to search files where there was every indication that

17

there might be references to the petitioner but these were

18

third party tax files, and the government claimed that

19

everything in those files would be return information because

20

they were third party files which had information in them which

21

would be associated with or identify third party taxpayers.

22

So in this very case, the petitioner is being

23

deprived of any chance of obtaining information that the

24

Internal Revenue Service maintains about it because the

25

government says —

9

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

Can I interrupt you just a minute to get

the example.
Supposing there's just one tax return with the name

3
4

of your client in it, a third party tax return.

5

you have a right to have access to the information on that

6

return, other than the identity of the taxpayer?

7

MR. HERTZBERG:

8

QUESTION:

9

Do you contend

Yes, if it refers to the petitioner.

Are you therefore contending that that tax

return at the time of the request is not return information?
MR. HERTZBERG:

10

At the time of the request?

I think

11

our position, Your Honor, is clearly any information in that

12

return which does not identify the taxpayer -QUESTION:

13
14

is return information and part is not return information.
MR. HERTZBERG:

15
16

Well, in other words, a part of the return

That's right.

It's a definitional

exception.

17

QUESTION:

So is there anything in your view in the

18

concept of return information other than the names of

19

taxpayers?

20

MR. HERTZBERG:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Certainly.

Or things that will specifically identify

a return with a particular taxpayer?
MR. HERTZBERG:

If I understand the question

24

correctly, anything in the files that the Internal Revenue

25

Service maintains is potentially return information.

10

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

QUEST'ION:

1

Well, but potential, I'm talking about at

2

the time of the request, because I'm not talking about

3

subsequent reformulation or -- see, I think there's a big

4

difference between reformulating in response to an FOIA request

5

and reformulation that took place by the government preceding

6

the request when it prepared some statistical study.

7

putting that to one side, and just saying, at the time of the

8

request, is it your view that everything on a return that would

9

not identify that return with a particular taxpayer is not

10

And

return information?

11

MR. HERTZBERG:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

But if the government just makes a copy of

13

a return in its entirety, and then redacts, crosses out any

14

identifiable information, is that return information, what's

15

left?

16

MR. HERTZBERG:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes.

Yes.

You mean from a return?

They just copy a return but then

strike out anything that's identifying.
MR. HERTZBERG:

No.

I'm sorry.

The data that is

20

remaining which does not identify the taxpayer, and if it

21

cannot be associated with the taxpayer, is not return

22

information in our view.

23

entire Statutory scheme because Congress was concerned with the

24

improper dissemination of information from the Internal Revenue

25

Service files which could be linked to particular taxpayers.

*

And that is consistent with the

11

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

QUESTION:

1

But how do you tell that?

Whether

2

information can in fact be linked?

3

particular individual's report of his gross income for that

4

year?

5

I mean, what about a

Just the figure of gross income?
MR. HERTZBERG:

,

We would maintain that in most

6

circumstances, the Agency would have to agree that just a

7

figure would not identify the taxpayer.

8

request saying, we would like to see John Doe's return.

You cannot make a
Under
o

9

that circumstance, anything you received in response to your

10

FOIA request could not possibly not be identified or associated

11

with John Doe because you are getting material in response to a

12

specific request.

13

But that's not our case.

If you ask for information

14

about yourself, for instance, or petitioner in this case, and

15

there is information in a taxpayer's file which is responsive

16

to that, and there is no way that it could be linked to John

17

Doe, it's not return information, and that is exactly what

18

Congress was concerned about.

19

QUESTION:

So if I give $25 to the Church of

20

Scientology ten years ago, and you come in and ask IRS for any

21

file that mentions the Church of Scientology, they should

22

disclose the fact that an unknown taxpayer gave $25 to the

23

Church of Scientology according to a return in their possession

24

ten years ago?

25

MR. HERTZBERG:

If the Church of Scientology is

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

mentioned in there, and the $25 donation can be disclosed

2

without any chance that it will identify or be associated with

3

the taxpayer —

4
5
6

QUESTION:

How does the IRS know whether there's any

chance it'll identify me or not?
MR. HERTZBERG:

Your Honor, this is the kind of

7

determination I think you're alluding to perhaps the informed

8

requester argument that the government makes, this is the kind

9

of decision that agencies make all the time under the Freedom

10

of Information act, and they work in conjunction of course with

11

the de novo review that the Courts have of these determinations

12

to make informed decisions that information will not identify

13

somebody, or under other subsections of the Freedom of

14

Information Act, for instance, like subsections 4, 6 and 7,

15

that they will not constitute unwarranted privacies or lead to

16

furnishing information about investigations that are underway.

17

This is the kind of every day determination that is

18

made by agencies under the exemption statutes of the Freedom of

19

Information Act.

20

21
22

QUESTION:

May I ask you another question about that

hypothetical?
There's a return in the IRS files with a $25 donation

23

to the organization shown on it.

24

request is made, is that return in your view, as you read the

25

Statute, in a form which cannot be associated with or otherwise

Heritage

Now, at that time, when the

identify directly or indirectly a particular taxpayer?

2

the page of the return with the name of the taxpayer on the top

3

of it.

4

MR. HERTZBERG:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HERTZBERG:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

It's on

At that moment?

It's clearly return information.
It is return information, Your Honor.

If it's return information, then it's

exempted from the Statute.
MR. HERTZBERG:

Except that you cannot divorce in our

10

view the Statute that we're talking about in the Internal

11

Revenue Code from the duty to segregate and delete —

12

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Yeah, but there's no duty to segregate in

the Internal Revenue Code.
MR. HERTZBERG:

But it is in the Freedom of

Information Act.

16

QUESTION:

Now, explain that to me.

17

MR. HERTZBERG:

18

QUESTION:

All right.

Where in the Freedom of Information Act is

19

there a duty to make something that is return information into

20

something that's not return information?

21

MR. HERTZBERG:

Well, I would say that the duty flows

22

from the segregability and deletion requirement of Section

23

552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act which says that,

24

exempt material which can be deleted and segregated -- excuse

25

me -- when exempt material can be deleted from nonexempt

material

2

QUESTION:

That's right, but the whole return, is

3

exempt when you start from it.

4

MR. HERTZBERG:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

I'm sorry?

But at the time of the request, the whole

return is exempt material.
MR. HERTZBERG:

Yes, but first of all, the Court

8

below, Your Honor, found that the section 6103(B)(2) was a

9

Freedom of Information Act (b)(3) exemption statute, so they

10

must be read together.

11

QUESTION:

Inaudible (no mike)

12

MR. HERTZBERG:

That's correct.

We prevailed on that

13

issue in the Court below, Your Honor, against the vigorous

14

opposition of the government.

15

in fact, the Court of Appeals below found that the two statutes

16

were entirely harmonious.

17

They did not cross petition, and

And when we read them in the context of this

18

particular case, you may take return information, Your Honor,

19

which is return information in the first instance, and if it

20

can be deleted from and separated out from other information,

21

which is not exempt information --

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but my hypothetical is that the whole

tax return is return information.
MR. HERTZBERG:

Well, Your Honor, tax returns per se

cannot be disclosed under Section 6103(a).

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1
2

I understand.

But the tax return and its

attachments are return information.
MR. HERTZBERG:

3

Yes, Your Honor.

But the Haskell

4

Amendment is in the definitional section for return

5

information, a distinction is made in the statutory scheme

6

between returns and return information.

7

prohibition against release of returns and return information

8

in 6103(a).

9

of return and return information and the Haskell Amendment

There is a general

In (b), there are separate definitional sections

10

appears solely in the definitional section for return

11

information.
So Congress itself made the distinction.

12

13

a very critical distinction.

14
15

QUESTION:

Then returns are never disclosable, you're

saying, even if you redact them?

16

MR. HERTZBERG:

17

QUESTION:

18

And that's

That's correct, Your Honor.

So the example we gave, you'd say that was

not returnable even if you redacted the names?

19

MR. HERTZBERG:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HERTZBERG:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct, if it's a return.

If it's a return.
Yes, Your Honor.

So no information that's in the tax

23

returns themselves under your view of the case must be

24

produced?

25

MR. HERTZBERG:

Heritage

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

1

I see.

MR. HERTZBERG:

2

And I'm sorry because I think that I

3
QUESTION:

4
5

That's not the answer you gave to the

hypothetical.
MR. HERTZBERG:

6

I was just going to say.

I think I

7

misunderstood the question and I was just going to try to

8

retrench on those very grounds.
QUESTION:

9

So you're only seeking information that is

10

in supplementary papers in a file but no information that's in

11

tax returns themselves?

12

MR. HERTZBERG:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HERTZBERG:

15

clear.

QUESTION:

r

It's my fault I did not make that

Including the $25 contribution on the

return to the Church of Scientology?
MR. HERTZBERG:

18
19

I hadn't understood that before.

I misunderstood the question.

16
17

That's correct, Your Honor.

If that is in the return, would it be

excluded?

20

QUESTION:

Yes, in my hypothetical return.

21

MR. HERTZBERG:

22

So that I can be clear on this, the statutory scheme

Yes, Your Honor.

'

23

excludes disclosure of returns, and that is not the issue.

24

are talking about return information and part of the definition

25

of Return Information in 6103(b)(2) is the Haskell Amendment.

Heritage

17
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

We

1
2

And that's all we're talking about.
We're talking about apparent information about the

3

petitioner in this case responsive to the Petitioner's Freedom

4

of Information Act request, which is in third party taxpayer

5

files, but not in returns.

6

return information.

7

QUESTION:

We are talking about other data,

Now, the Freedom of Information Act

8

doesn't have any standing requirement, does it?

QUESTION:

Mr. Hertzberg, I think where I get

confused in this whole matter as far as your presentation is

concerned is how to properly relate the Freedom of Information

14

15

record shall be provided with the exemption provision for

16

return information, together with the Haskell Amendment.

Now, the Haskell Amendment says that the term, return

information, doesn't include data in a form which can't be

associated with the taxpayer.

form which cannot identify the taxpayer.

21

that kind of a form, then it simply isn't exempt, as I read it,

from the Freedom of Information Act.

read the Freedom of Information Act as importing some

We think that as with many of the other exemptions

for the Freedom of Information Act having to be narrowly

20

construed, having to be read in favor of the broad mandate of

the Freedom of Information Act to disclose, if you can take

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT G. LAUBER, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LAUBER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
I'd like to begin by giving my answer to a couple of

11
12

questions that came up during the first argument.

It is

13

important to keep returns and return information distinct in

14

ones mind to the extent one can with these abstract phrases.

15

Return is basically the Form 1040 and the attached

16

Schedule A, Schedule B, Schedule C, Schedule D, the return

17

itself.

18

The Haskell Amendment does not apply to them, and they cannot

19

be disclosed even in redacted form.

20

And those are protected absolutely from disclosure.

Return information is basically everything else as we

21

see it in the taxpayer's audit file, except for the return.

22

There might be a report of the examining agent showing the

23

results of his audit.

24

taxpayer protesting the proposed deficiency of the agent once

25

set up.

There might be a protest from the

There could be internal IRS correspondence about the

nature of the taxpayer's claims.

2

Deficiency issued by the IRS to the taxpayer proposing an

3

increase in his taxes.

4

taxpayer for a tax deficiency.

5

There can be a Notice of

There could be a tax bill billing the

All those other things are return information because

6

they are data that are either furnished to, collected by,

7

prepared by the IRS in connection with the determination of

8

that person's tax liability.

9

numbers on the return will find their way into the rest of the

10

file because if you audit somebody's charitable contributions,

11

you'll put down in your report what those contributions were.

12

Now, the point is, a lot of the

The point is, all the little numbers on the return

13

will find their way into all the other documents that are

14

called return information in the file.

15

concrete example of what the Chief Justice asked about.

16

we're saying is all those other documents are immune from

17

disclosure.

18

redact all those other documents: the revenue agent's report,

19

the tax bill, notice of deficiency, and then disclose them in

20

redacted form.

And that gives a
What

They're saying, except for the return, you have to

21

Now, Justice White asked a question about would the

22

IRS have to disclose in response to a request how many people

23

earned income of $45,212?

24

be required, nor can any agency, to create a new document by

25

doing research for the taxpayer, and saying okay, we think

Heritage

The answer is, no.

The IRS cannot

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

based on our records, there were 572 returns filed of that

2

sort.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

That's because of the Freedom of

Information Act?
MR. LAUBER:

That's because of the FOIA, there's no

6

requirement for an agency to create a document.

If there were

7

no list in the files when the request came in, listing the

8

number of guys who had returns with that amount of income, you

9

wouldn't have to create such a list.

What they would say you

10

would have to do is disclose every piece of return information

11

of people who had that amount of income, removing their names.

12

QUESTION:

Well, let's suppose that there is a

13

document in the file that's not a return, but by anybody's

14

definition, that document has return information in it?

15

MR. LAUBER:

Well, the document is return information

16

if it is a document created by the IRS in connection with the

17

determination of liability.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LAUBER:

20

21

Yes.
It's not just the numbers but the

document itself is return information.
QUESTION:

Well, it's got some identifying

22

information in it, and it is return information.

23

your position that the government would have to redact that

24

document to eliminate the identifying information?

25

MR. LAUBER:

No.

Heritage

Now, is it

As Justice O'Connor said, once it

Yes, it's just a like a return.

3

4

MR. LAUBER:

5

You don't

This is return information and is

Yes. And that's a very good point,

6

because if petitioners are right in their redaction, why did

7

Congress say, you can't disclose returns even if they are

8

redacted, when the same numbers are on the other stuff in the

9

file, and they said it has to be.
QUESTION:

10
11

It doesn't make any sense.

Well, the statute exempts return

information.

12

MR. LAUBER:

13

QUESTION:

Right.
And just like it does returns.

And if

14

returns aren't redactable, I would suppose other documents that

15

are return information don't have to be redacted either.
MR. LAUBER:

16
17

That is our position.

And we make that

point in pages 25 and 26 of our brief.
I think Justices O'Connor and Stevens hit on the key

18
19

point in the case, which is where do you get this redaction

20

requirement.

Where does it come from.

Here we have these documents like a revenue agent's

21
22

report that is return information.

23

the IRS, requires it to redact it to turn it into something

24

that is not return information?

25

come from?

Heritage

Now, what is it that causes

Where does this requirement

27
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

It can't come from Section 6103.

1

it says nothing at

2

all about redaction.

3

was enacted in the same bill as 6103 governs the disclosure of

4

redacted private letter rulings and background file documents.

5

It does have a redaction requirement in it.

6

was enacted in the same bill as our Statute, there's no

7

redaction requirement in 6103.

8

telling distinction.

9

Now, significantly in Section 6110 which

And although it

And I think that's quite a

Rather, petitioner gets the redaction requirement not

10

from the Taxpayer Privacy Act, but from the FOIA, which

11

requires that reasonably segregable portions of documents be

12

released, once you redact them to remove the FOIA exempt

13

material.

14

come right down to it.

15

But this is really just circular reasoning, when you

The FOIA redaction requirement only comes into play

16

when you have a document that is subject to FOIA, whereas here

17

you have a document that is exempt from FOIA, as these tax

18

related documents are, you never get to the redaction

19

requirement.

20

redact a document to cause it to lose its exemption 3 status.

21

It's just circular reasoning.

Well, but the sponsor also referred to the

18
19
20

MR. LAUBER:

Okay.

I have a long answer to that

question.

.
There are two parts.

First of all, what the tax

21

model was back then, and secondly, why it doesn't help the

22

petitioners.

23

The tax model is kind of a misnomer.

What it is is

24

actually raw data.

25

from a stratified sample of about 100,000 individual tax

It's a compilation of data that was drawn

2

tape.

3

were about 150 what they call fields or like entry boxes, where

4

you would put the numbers for that sample.

5

It was basically a pile of numbers on a computer

For every return that was chosen for the sample, there

About 30 of these entry boxes did not correspond at

6

all to numbers or line items on a return.

7

computed amounts reflecting economic concepts like expanded

8

income or capital gains tax at fifty percent rate.

9

in the description of the tax model the IRS put out for 1976.

10

Rather, they were

This is all

Most of the other entry boxes on each sample did

11

correspond roughly to line items on a return like salaries and

12

wages, salaries and wages.

13

exceptions from that.

14

would be corrected for mathematical errors and to eliminate any

15

internal inconsistencies on the taxpayer's return.

16

17

taxpayer's return might be combined before transferring them to

18

the tax model.

19

a director's fee as

20

21

22

from the return.

23

But there were a number of

First of all, the numbers on the return

And then

A number of the items on the

For example, if a taxpayer reported a bonus or
miscellaneous income, that would be added

So it would be different treatment

And finally, some items would be treated differently

24

on the tax model for economic reasons than they were shown on

25

the return.

For example, an earned income credit which was

Heritage

33
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

shown on the return as a tax payment was shown on the model as

2

a reduction in tax liability.

3

So basically, in 1976, the tax model was a

4

compilation of data many of whose entries were lifted verbatim

5

from tax returns with all identifiers removed.

6

was some reformulation of the data by the IRS.

7

QUESTION:

But there also

Are you saying that the pre-1981 versions

8

of the tax model are reformulated in fact within the meaning of

9

the opinion of the Court of Appeals below?

10

MR. LAUBER:

I think.

Some of the items were.

Some

11

items just came over line for line, some would be changed, and

12

new items would be added to the ,tax models.

13

arguably a reformulation under Judge Scalia's test.

So I think it was

But what ever one calls it, it doesn't help the

piece of paper that was a copy of Mr. Average Taxpayer's

we have to put them into disclosable form.

QUESTION:

MR. LAUBER:

There might be —

Why is that?
Well, that's how we keep our records,

7

basically.

9

with guidelines for examiners about how to conduct audits of

I mean, what you would have there would be like a

10

that kind of tax shelter or that kind of taxpayer.

And those

11

files would be searched in response to a FOIA request, and such

12

things would be disclosed because they are not collected by the

3

IRS in connection with the particular taxpayers' liability.

They are general instructions about how to audit a class of

5

people.

that wouldn't even be return information.

the Haskell Amendment for that because it wouldn't even be

whole case began with the question about what is a proper scope

of the search.

3

of file documents.

4

audit files of particular named taxpayers we don't need to

5

search, because the way we keep our records, there should be

6

nothing in there but return information.

7

And the IRS has just miles and miles and miles
And their position was all the individual

And it would simply be impossible to go rummaging

8

through all those files looking for some, one little study that

9

somebody kind of found its way into a file by mistake.

That

10

study would appear somewhere else, and you'd look for it there.

11

But Judge Scalia clearly held in the panel opinion below that

12

if the IRS can produce affidavits on remand that a whole group

13

of individual audit files, for example, have nothing but return

14

information in them, they don't even have to be searched. And

15

that is the only practical way to administer the Privacy Act.

16

You can't go looking for a needle in a haystack

17

through files that are not meant to contain things like

18

compilations of data or studies.

textural arguments which we have made in our brief.

statute itself was a blanket prohibition against the release of

Census Data Act provided that raw census data which does not
