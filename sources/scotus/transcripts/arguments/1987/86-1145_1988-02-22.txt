MR. LYON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The question before this Court today is whether the
State of Oregon has authorized these defendants to monopolize a

part of the practice of medicine in the relevant market and

whether it has actively supervised their doing so.

Circuit held that although there was sufficient evidence of the

13

defendants' anticompetitive motive and sufficient evidence of

14

their conduct, nevertheless what they did, unprofessional as it

15

might have been, was immunized from antitrust laws by reason of

policy.
The second branch of the test is whether or not it is
actively supervised by the State itself.
Turning to the second of these first, was this
conduct of defendants' actively supervised by the State of
Oregon?

The defendants, the hospital, its staff and committees

are all private parties.
of Oregon.

They are not agencies of the State

They are not subject to the State Administrative

Procedure Act.

There is no State statute providing any State

agency which reviews what they do, authorizes any State agency
to reverse what they do.
There is no State statute giving a right of appeal to
any particular court under any form of procedure.
QUESTION:

Is there no mechanism in Oregon in your

view for a judicial review of the deprivation of the privilege
to restore that privilege?
MR. LYON:

Certainly no clear review.

There have

been only two cases in which the State of Oregon Supreme Court
considered whether or not it had such power.

In both cases, it

expressly said that it did not decide whether it had the power
or not.
QUESTION:

So perhaps that power exists?

MR. LYON:

Perhaps that power might exist.

QUESTION:

It wasn't pursued by your client here?

3

MR. LYON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

Now, I guess there is a State action for

5
6
7

interference with business relations?
MR. LYON:

That is.

That is a private tort action

remedy that is available under State law.

8

QUESTION:

And that also was not pursued?

9

MR. LYON:

That was pursued.

That was our State law

10

count that was tried in this particular case, and we want a

11

verdict on that with punitive damages.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Is that a form of State supervision in a

sense, do you think, to provide that kind of an action?
MR. LYON:

Your Honor, this Court has never so held.

15

It would strike me as anomalous to say that because private

16

conduct, because a State provides a forum in which litigants

17

can sue each other and redress their private grievances, that

18

doesn't amount to State action.

19

For example, the State provides a forum for people

20

who have a dispute over a breach of contract or a tort.

That

21

does not mean the State is actively supervised in what they do.

22

The standard that this Court has announced is whether

23

there is a pointed reexamination of what goes on in the

24

challenged restraint to see that it does not unnecessarily

25

interfere with the policies of the antitrust laws.

Heritage

This Court

1

has never held that judicial review of this type is that kind

2

of pointed reexamination of the anticompetitive conduct.
And least of all, I should suggest, should the Court

3
4

announce that as a principle for the first time in a case where

5

the State Supreme Court does not even know whether it has

6

jurisdiction to consider these kinds of issues.

7

When Dr. Patrick was confronted with what was being

8

done to him in Astoria, there was really nothing he could do.

9

The one thing that occurred to him to do was to at least ask

10

the hospital to appoint a neutral panel to consider the charges

11

that were made against him.

12

decision the panel and the hospital would make if they would

13

only appoint a neutral panel.

14

that, that would avoid a lot of controversy and a lot of

15

expense.

The Court of Appeals purported to find active

18

supervision in three ways.

That's true, Your Honor.

As far as

administering it.

3

another statute that says that the people who participate in

4

peer review are immune from liability for whatever they do in

5

peer review, provided they act in good faith.

I contend that by the inclusion of that, the State

6
7

contemplates the possibility that defendants might abuse this

8

position, might abuse the peer review procedures for their own

9

motive, and therefore it leaves to the person who is the victim

10

of that, the right to sue for damages for the peoples' bad

11

faith.

That is the remedy.

QUESTION:

It is a State created body?

authority over the hospital.
QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't that give them

authority over the peer committee?
MR. LYON:

Because all that the State statute gives

15

the Health Division the power to do is to see to it to assure

16

that the trustees have adopted procedures for peer review.

17

does not give them the power to engage in what this Court has

18

referred to previously as appointed reexamination of what goes

19

on in peer review applying the rules to a particular case.

Convince me that it's not.

There's been no reported case, there's no

The first branch of the state action doctrine is that

2
3

the challenged restraint must be one which is clearly

4

articulated and affirmatively expressed as State policy.

5

Court of Appeals declared that in this case this particular

6

conduct was indeed clearly authorized by State policy.

7

that, the Court of Appeals was referring to the Statute which

8

required hospitals to have peer review procedures in place.

The

By

There is nothing in the Statute that indicates that

9
10

the State of Oregon ever intended these physicians or any other

11

physicians to monopolize any branch of the practice of medicine

12

within the State of Oregon.

13

Statute was to improve patient care, to reduce mortality, to

14

promote patient welfare.

The only purpose stated for this

15

It does not follow that because the State requires

16

peer review for the purpose of patient care, that authorizes

17

people to abuse that procedure for their own anticompetitive

18

purposes.

19

That is the mistake that the Court of Appeals made.
You can tell that from the Statute itself, from the

20

articulated purposes, and second of all, you can tell that from

21

the fact that the State itself contemplated, as I said, that

22

this power might be abused and it left the defendants, those

23

who did abuse it, to the liability that they would encounter in

24

an action for damages such as this or one under State

procedure.

The iruny of Lhis case is that if this sort of
behavior is allowed to take place under the guise of the state
action doctrine under the state action immunities, it will lead
to exactly the opposite result of that which the State
contemplated.

If the more powerful cannot compete by being

good, then they can drive out those who are better and yet do
not have the power to resist the influence in this particular
case.

8

MR. LYON:

QUESTION:

10

MR. LYON:

Because unless there is a procedure in a

case whereby the particular result in a particular case can be

12

challenged, can be reviewed by the State to see that the State

13

policy is being carried out, the State policy of bettering

14

patient care, of reducing mortality, then without a system in

20

I don't recall all of the details of the AMA
proposals, but I do not believe they provided for that.
The Court of Appeals also held that the evidence that

21

was admitted with respect to the activities of one of the

22

defendants, Dr. Russell, who was a member of the Board of

23

Medical Examiners, that his conduct also was state action, and

24

that invalidated the verdict in this particular case.

25

We challenge that particular holding for several

FirsL ul all, we did not sue the State Board of

Medical Examiners in this case.

We sued them previously for

violations of the Civil Rights laws, and for violation of the
Oregon Administrative Procedures Act, but that case was over.
This was an action for treble damages for Dr.
Patrick's loss of his hospital privileges and the destruction
of his practice in Oregon.

not seek damages.

We did

The damages that we sought were for injury

to his business and property, which derived from the loss of
his hospital privileges afterwards.
Dr. Russell furthermore had disqualified himself at
the beginning of the proceedings and under Oregon law, he was
therefore entirely without authority to act in any way
thereafter.
Because of all of those reasons, the evidence of his
conduct was admissible, should have been admitted, and the case
should not have been reversed on that account.
That's all I have, Your Honor, unless you have any
further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. TRIPLETT, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. TRIPLETT;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court.
Oregon, like many States, in the mid-70s was faced

6

7

with a malpractice crisis.

8

doctors was spiraling, the loss of doctors from practicing

9

because of the lack of coverage was increasing, and indeed, the

10

The cost of insurance premiums for

human tragedy visited by malpractice was evident to all.
The State of Oregon recognized that it had to address

11
12

this malpractice crisis in a multifaceted way.

It first armed

13

the governing board of the hospitals of each private hospital

14

with a substantial degree of direction and authority.

15

were compelled not to simply accept a doctor because they had a

16

license to practice in the State, but rather to make a more

17

discriminating choice of whether they had the skill and

18

training to receive credentialing in the specific areas in

19

which they sought to practice.

They

They were compelled to establish standards for the

20

review of doctors by doctors.

23

purpose of reducing morbidity mortality and to improve patient

care.

And indeed they were compelled

The Board of

the key portions of that authority was that its proceedings

21

QUESTION:

Was it the State policy to reduce the

number of doctors practicing in the State.
MR. TRIPLETT:

The net effect of that policy would be

22

to reduce those doctors who ought not continue to practice.

23

the net effect is that indeed marketplace access was being

24

limited or correspondingly, the door out was being opened.

25

QUESTION:

I think all that you've described shows

Heritage

16

So

±

that there's been State action, but as I understood the State

2

action defense in antitrust law, it was that this particular

3

result which the Federal antitrust law declares to be unlawful,

4

if that result is declared to be lawful by the State, then it's

5

all right.

6

So if the Federal antitrust law would forbid price

7

fixing but the State says, we want price fixing, then the

8

Federal Government would leave it alone.

9

all you've said is I don't see how this shows any State policy

Now, the trouble with

that would allow doctors to monopolize the practice.
If the State said, we want doctors to be able to

12

exclude, there are too many doctors in the area, then I'd agree

13

that there was a State action defense.

14

MR. TRIPLETT:

The State did direct hospitals to

15

cause doctors to review doctors at the hospital level.

16

effect of doctors reviewing doctors for purposes of determining

17

whether they retained their privileges within a hospital would

18

inexorably be the exclusion of doctors from the privilege to

QUESTION:

Well, what business is it of ours?

MR. LYON:

It is none, Your Honor.

And I'm glad you

said that, Your Honor.
As for Oregon Or.Rev. Stat. 41.675, which counsel
tells the Court creates right of judicial review.

What the

Statute is is a statute that —
QUESTION:

What page are you reading from?

MR. LYON:

I'm reading from page 46 of their brief,

Your Honor.
All this Statute is is a statute that has to do with
the evidentiary privileges.

And what it says is that the

State, the evidentiary statute that says this evidence is not
admissible does not apply, "in a judicial proceeding in which a
health care practitioner contests the denial, restriction or
termination of clinical privileges by a health care facility."
From that evidentiary statute, he would elaborate and
invent a judicial remedy.

It doesn't exist.

We say that that

statute is consistent with exactly what happened in this case.
You have a State statute that says that defendants are liable
for damages if they act in bad faith.

You have another

evidentiary statute that says that the evidence is admissible
in such a proceeding where a practitioner contests what
happened with him.

those cases was a mandamus case where the plaintiff brought an
