ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Cohen,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
After stating the background of this case, I will

11

argue that the Navy's decision not to grant someone with

12

respondent's history a security clearance to work on repairing

13

nuclear submarines is not and should not be subject to

14

substantive review by the Merit Systems Protection Board.

15

The Board has in certain cases including this one

16

power to review the procedures followed by the employing agency

17

in denying a clearance but there has been no challenge to the

18

procedures followed by the Navy in this case.

19

not have authority to review the merits of a procedurally

20

proper agency decision to deny a clearance.

Navy's statement, he did not ask to confront or cross examine

anyone or to be heard further by the Navy.

I want to make two

The first is that there simply is no due process
Respondent was given notice of the

His response, with the

When he sought review by the MSPB, he did not

10

challenge the adequacy of the Navy's processes, and although

11

the presiding official was willing to hear him on the merits of

12

the clearance determination, he twice failed to respond to the

13

Board's notice that a hearing would be convened at his request.

14

The only thing he has placed in issue in this case is

15

the Navy's judgment, based on the results of the investigation,

16

that a clearance should be denied.

17

Second and more generally, it is the employing agency

18

connection with the denial of a clearance.

20

does contend that the employing agency has not given him an

21

adequate opportunity to be heard, the MSPB's job, is it itself

22

said, to rule on the adequacy of the agency's process.

24

Circuit.

does the statute.

4

U.S.C. 7513 gives the MSPB power to review denial of Mr. Egan's

5

clearance on its merits.

Nor, we think,

And I want to turn to the question whether 5

The first thing I want to say is that the Board's

6
7

answer that it can review procedures but not substance, seems

8

to us the most plausible reading of the statutory text.

9

Everyone agrees that Mr. Egan had a right to be removed only

10

for cause under section 7513, and the right to appeal his

11

removal to the MSPB.
Everyone also agrees that the MSPB has no general

12

13

jurisdiction to review the denial of a security clearance as

14

such.

15

employee who is simply transferred to a different job, or who

16

doesn't get access to a particular part of the facility because

17

he isn't given a security clearance has no MSPB review because

18

there's nothing for the Board's jurisdiction to attach to.

19

For example, an employee who loses a promotion or an

The Board said in essence that if an agency fails to

20

follow the proper procedures so that there has been no valid

21

security clearance determination, then there is no cause for

22

the removal.

23

and has reached a determination denying a clearance, then

24

nothing in the statute gives the Board the right to reverse the

25

clearance determination, or disregard it, just because the

But if the agency has followed proper procedures,

agency has not persuaded the Board.

/

In addition to thinking that this is the most
plausible reading of the statute, we have two --

4

QUESTION:

5

statute should go right across the board to any kind of a

6

removal or just to any adverse action?

7
8
9
10
11

,

MR. COHEN:

I think it should go to any adverse

action.
QUESTION:

Well, does this construction apply to

anything but security clearances?
MR. COHEN:

I think that the question of the Board's

12

power to review the merits of collateral determinations that

13

lead to adverse actions is a question that the Board is in the

14

process of working out.

15

job because, for example, he is found to be medically unfit,

16

found to have a medical condition, I take it that the Board-

17

would review whether the existence of that medical condition is

18

cause for removal from that job, but wouldn't review the

19

medical determination itself on the merits.

But in general, if someone is denied a

20

I do think that the question of the extent to which

21

the Board should probe underlying collateral decisions is one

22

that may vary from case to case, depending on what the

23

underlying decision is.

24
25

)

Do you suggest that that reading of the

QUESTION:

Didn't the Board mention its deference to

disbarment proceedings and criminal convictions in its opinion?

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

8

MR. COHEN:

1

Yes, it did.

Those are, as our

2

opponents have pointed out, decisions that will have been

3

rendered by someone other than the employing agency.

4

only partially true here.

5

Navy made these two different determinations.

That's

Here, two different parts of the

6

But, yes, the Board did mention that.

7

QUESTION:

How about removal for some kind of

8

wrongdoing or failure to adequately perform in the employing

9

agency?
MR. COHEN:

10

Well, in the event of wrongdoing, the

11

agency is required to persuade the Board by a preponderance of

12

the evidence that the wrongdoing occurred because that is the

13

cause for the removal.

14

Here, « the cause for the removal is the lack of a

15

security clearance which is a separate determination, and the

16

question is whether that separate determination by a different

17

part of the agency is subject to review by the preponderance

18

standard.

19

QUESTION:

What if an agency establishes as a

20

qualification for a particular job, high skill level.

21

it makes a separate determination that this individual who has

22

been in the job does not have a high skill level, and another

23

part of the agency makes that determination.

24

doubt that the MSPB would determine whether that judgment was

25

true or not?

Heritage

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

And then

9
1

MR. COHEN:

2

QUESTION:

No.

I think that it probably would.

So what is the law?

You can't just be

3

relying upon the language of the statute and say you cannot go

4

behind the fact that there was a cause for removal, and that

5

the cause had been determined to exist by the agency, and not

6

look into whether it was properly determined.

7

MR. COHEN:

I'm not just relying on the language of

8

the statute.

I think that the language of the statute creates

9

problem that exists in a number of cases of how far you look

10

behind the final action of the agency that is subject to MSPB

11

review and look into the merits of collateral decisions.

12

I think the agency drew the right line in this case

13

because of the nature of the decision and because of the

14

history of these kinds of decisions.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's not compelled by statute.

16

You're really just arguing that this language of the statute

17

allows you to draw this line.

18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. COHEN:

It certainly doesn't compel it.

Well, my words were, it is the most

plausible application of the statute to this case.
QUESTION:

Because of the distinctive characteristics

of what the determination was in this case.
MR. COHEN:

All right, yes.

It's certainly not

compelled by the words of the statute.
There are two other closely related reasons for
thinking that Congress did not intend to confer the power to

Heritage

Reporting

(202) 628-4888

10
/

1

review these decisions on the MSPB.

2

The Civil Service Commission did not review security clearance

3

determinations by employing agencies.

4

inherited the CSC's review powers, and there's simply no

5

evidence that Congress intended to give the MSPB larger powers

6

in this respect.

7

One of them is historical.

The MSPB generally

The other, which I think explains why the Civil

8

Service Commission did not review clearance determinations is

9

that outside review of the merits of clearance determinations

10

by a defense agency is functionally inappropriate.

11

should, after affording an employee an adequate chance to be

12

heard, have the final say about whether it trusts him on board

13

one of its submarines.

14
15
16

The Navy

And I want to make three points about the nature of
that decision.
QUESTION:

Before you get into that, as to the first

17

point which you just went off of, you said prior to the new

18

legislation, the Civil Service Commission hadn't reviewed it.

19

But there are a lot of things that the Civil Service Commission

20

didn't review, aren't there, that used to be reviewed by Courts

21

that have been given to the MSPB.

22

everything that the MSPB now has was matter that the Civil

23

Service Commission used to have.

24

through the Civil Service Commission, but would go directly to

25

the Courts.

You certainly can't say that

Some of it would never go

Isn't that right?

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

11

1

I think that's right.

But I also think

2

that where that is the case, it is explicit or at least

3

affirmatively indicated in the legislative history and that

4

there is legislative history suggesting a presumption of

5

continuation of the Civil Service Commission's jurisdiction

6

without expansion except where there's other evidence.

7

QUESTION:

There were court decisions that had made

8

this kind of an inquiry before the Civil Service Reform Act was

9

passed, weren't there?

Hadn't the D.C. Circuit looked into

10

denial of security clearances?

11

MR. COHEN:

Actually, the D.C. Circuit case, the

12

Hoska case came up after the Civil Service Reform Act was

13

passed, and in that case, after an MSPB presiding official

14

affirmed the agency's determination and there was no petition

15

to the full Board, the D.C. Circuit in the Hoska case reviewed

16

that determination and reversed it on the merits.

17

that decision is wrong.

18

that that decision is wrong.
We've said that right along.

20

QUESTION:

MR. COHEN:

submarines some individuals who will never compromise sensitive

12

In particular, denial of a security clearance may

well be warranted when predicate facts are less than probable.

14

If an investigation leaves the Navy with an irreducible

15

suspicion that an employee has committed acts whose repetition

would endanger security, common sense as well as Presidential

QUESTION:

Congress did not give the

Mr. Cohen, can I just ask one kind of

general question.

7

Does your argument apply equally to a removal from a

8

position to a person who previously obtained a security

9

clearance but had his security clearance revoked?

10

Is there any

difference, do you think?

11

MR. COHEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COHEN:

I don't think so.
Okay.
The security clearance process is not an

14

attempt to judge an individual's past conduct, but to predict

15

his future behavior.

16

Mr. Egan has done something to deserve being barred from

17

working at Bremerton, but whether there is an unacceptable risk

18

that he would compromise sensitive information either

19

deliberately or inadvertently or under compulsion for some

20

reason.

21

The question in this case is not whether

That is a judgment that can only be made by people

22

who are expert in the aspects of human behavior that render

23

individuals vulnerable to espionage.

QUESTION:

Of course, construing 1712 and 1713 as the

12

Court of Appeals said wouldn't really keep the agency from

13

insulating security cancellations from judicial review.

14

could proceed another way, couldn't they?

QUESTION:

17

MR. COHEN:

Right.
And the Court of Appeals based its

decision here in part on the existence of that section.
QUESTION:

But my question is, you'll admit the

20

agency's interests could be protected if they proceeded under

21

that section?

22

MR. COHEN:

If they did proceed under that section.

23

That section, which I do want to talk about, gives the

24

Secretary of the Navy and other agency heads the power to

2

employee the reasons, "as specifically as security

3

considerations permit," giving him some kind of an intra agency

4

hearing after which he may be removed and the removal is

5

expressly excluded from any MSPB review even of process.

6

And then after giving the

I think we want to say two things about that.

We

7

think it has little or no bearing on the present issue first

8

because it's clear that an employee who does not obtain a

9

security clearance that is a valid requirement of his job can

10

be removed for cause, like an employee who fails to meet any

11

other requirement without invoking 7532.

12

involved in this case agrees on that, although our papers note

13

that the District of Columbia Circuit later disagreed in a

14

different case.

15

Essentially, everyone

But the existence of 7532 has nothing to do, we

16

think, with whether Congress has authorized MSBP review of the

17

merits of security clearance determinations in cases where that

18

emergency section is not invoked.

19

for some kind of a hearing by the employing agency, and in non-

20

7532 cases where the adequacy of the agency process is put at

21

issue, I suppose 7532 might have some bearing by way of analogy

22

on that question of employing agency process.

23

7532 does expressly provide

But it does not, it seems to me, suggest that the

24

MSPB should in such a case take it on itself to review the

25

merits of the agency's clearance organization.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

16
1

QUESTION:

Why did the agency proceed under 1712 and

2

13 rather than 1732 in this case, or why would it in other

3

cases like this?

4

MR. COHEN:

Well, they could have been invoked.

This

5

was a new hire, an employee who was put through the agency's

6

routine security clearance process for somebody who is going to

7

have a laborer's job on board a submarine.

of that clearance process was negative, there was a removal,

And when the result

and the agency notified Mr. Egan that he was entitled to MSPB

11

review.

Which we think is an important right on his part.
It would have been possible, I think, but not the use

12

for which 7532 was intended, for Mr. Egan to have been

13

suspended without pay at the first sign that there might be a

14

security question here, and then —

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. COHEN:

Or later, when there was.
Yes.

And that the head of the agency,

17

the Secretary of the Navy, would then have had to rule

18

personally on this case.

have been no MSPB review whatever.

And if he had done so, there would

This is not a case in which the Navy had anything in

21

particular that it wished to conceal, or it could have invoked

22

7532 and escaped MSPB review entirely.

23

invoke that procedure here.

25

QUESTION:

But it had no reason to

What does the employee lose if the

considerations permit.

board and then a final determination by the head of the agency.

15

QUESTION:

And then a hearing before an agency

But apart from that, apart from its affect

16

on the employee, it would preserve the government's concerns,

17

entirely?

18

7532 as it could under 7513.

19

The government could protect itself as well under

MR. COHEN:

It would.

7532 would certainly protect

20

the government's concerns for secrecy in a case where it

21

doesn't want to tell the employee or the MSPB all of the

22

reasons for its concerns.

23

government's concern to give the employee the kind of

24

opportunity to respond and the kind of opportunity for an MSPB

25

check on its procedures that respondent had here.

Heritage

It would not protect the

1

It also would involve the Secretary of the Navy in

2

making personnel decisions about whether a laborer who is going

3

to work in a facility where the only reason for not letting him

4

work was because of the information with which he would come

5

into contact --

6

QUESTION:

Isn't there another difference, too.

7

Isn't under 7513 at the end of the line, there's judicial

8

review, is there not, whereas under 7532, there's not?

9

wrong on that?

MR. COHEN:

Or am I

Young that there is no judicial review and I think that would

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. NOLD

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. NOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.

5

In listening to the arguments presented by the Navy

6

in this case, I've tried to come up with a way that I could

7

possibly describe them.

8

same premise.

9

case that involves statutory interpretation.

And I think that we start out with the

We start out with the premise that this is a
It's at that

10

point that the government seems to walk away from that

11

question.

12

What they seem to do in my view is to start building

13

a cloud around the statute. They start building this cloud and

14

they call it national security, and as their argument
«

15

progresses down through their argument in their brief, the

16

cloud gets darker and darker and darker, so that by the time we

17

get to the end, we can't see the statute anymore.

18

is this cloud called national security.

19

What we see

I am not here to argue that national security is not

20

important.

21

would limit agencies' ability to maintain and protect national

22

security.

23

do by the President, and we want them to do it.

24
25

I am not here to take a position in this case that

That's obviously something that they've been told to

But what I want to do is to look at this statute
aside and apart from this cloud for just a moment, and see what

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

20
1

it says.

2

about removal for cause — 7513 -- but also the statute that

3

says you can remove somebody on the basis of national security.

4

I may even take a look at the statute that says that you can

5

remove someone because of poor performance.

6

Not only what the particular statute says that talks

Because the Civil Service Reform Act created a lot of

7

new things that the Civil Service Commission under the old

8

system didn't have.

9

Systems Protection Board, that was to hear these cases separate

10

It created an independent board, the Merit

and apart from agencies.
Now, when they did that, I believe that Congress was

11
12

the proper body to take a look at this cloud that's there or

13

take a look at this problem of national security, take a look

14

at this situation where the President has told agencies to make

15

sure you don't compromise security, and come up with a

16

statutory scheme that would not only protect the interest of

17

the employee, but also protect the interest of agencies in a

18

situation such as we have here.

19

that.

20

for just a moment.

21

And I believe that they did

And I would like to talk about these particular statutes

7513 is the statute that contains the language that

22

we've heard for years: you can't remove an employee unless it's

23

for cause that would promote the efficiency of the service.

24
25

There is another statute, Chapter 43 of the Act —
4303, I believe, that says now under the new law that you can

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

21
1

remove an employee for performance reasons.

2

show cause.

3

to the level that he's expected to perform.

4

You don't have to

You just have to show that he hasn't performed up

Now, taking those two statutes for a minute, the

5

courts have held that.an agency can terminate an employee on

6

performance-based reasons under Chapter 7513, that is, for

7

cause, because there might be situations where performance and

8

cause kind of go together.

9

do that, you are bound by the procedures, you are bound by the

But the cases have said that if you

10

burdens of proof, you are bound by all of the other rights that

11

the employee has under 7513.

12

You're not bound under the precise procedural

13

problems that are presented under performance based types of

14

claims.

15

Now, let me throw into the statutory scheme, 7532.

16

It wasn't created by the Civil Service Reform Act.

17

around for years.

18

recognizes is is that under some circumstances, there may be

19

situations when agencies ought to be able to terminate somebody

20

and not have somebody else essentially looking over their

21

shoulder and second guessing that move.

22

It's been

And what that says is, and what that

It isn't just that.

If the only

23

difference between 7532 and 7513 were the absence of MSBP

review, then you'd have a very strong case.

25

more than that.

But 7532 does much

It allows that person to be taken out of the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

job and off of the payroll immediately without any prior

2

procedures, and that can be the explanation of it, rather than

3

what you suggest.

4

MR. NOLD:

Justice Scalia, another explanation of it

5

could mean that the Congress in the legislative history under

6

7532 recognized that there might be situations where an

7

employee would have to be removed and taken out of the

8

government, not because of any fault of his own whatsoever.

Maybe a Russian agent moved in next door to him. Certainly,

10

that's not his fault.

there's no cause whatsoever from the standpoint of misconduct

17

described would be adequate grounds for denial of a security

18

19

MR. NOLD:

What you just

That's right. And in some cases, security

20

clearances like you say are revoked or denied because of

21

misconduct types of reasons, and sometimes not.

22

You asked earlier a question about what the employee

loses when 7532 is invoked.

24

importance that the employee gains.

25

the right to a hearing.

Heritage

There is something of a very real
Because what he gains is

Under the procedures that the MSBP

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

23
1

felt that were appropriate to review these kinds of cases, the

2

situation could be that the person never gets the opportunity

3

to sit down and cross examine and confront the people that say

4

that he's done x, y and z.

He's totally denied that right.

5

At least under 7532, he would have the opportunity to

6

have some form of hearing, even though that hearing would be in

7

front of the agency.

8

QUESTION:

Well, he is given it by the agency as the

9

agency's regulations now exist.

It's not in the CSRA, but the

10

agency does give him a hearing.

So in point of fact, there's

11

no difference right now between what happens under 7513 and

12

7532 .

13

MR. NOLD:

Well, the wording's the same.

14

QUESTION:

You're saying the agency isn't compelled

15
16

to give him a hearing, it's a matter of agency grace?
MR. NOLD:

No.

What I'm saying is that under 7532,

17

the statute says that he has the right to a hearing.

18

7513, the statute also says that he has a right to be heard

19

before the Merit Systems Protection Board.

20

directed by the statutes to hear and adjudicate the matters

21

that come before it.

22

Under

And this Board is

Now, under the scheme that has been adopted by the

23

Merit Systems Protection Board and found offensive by the

24

Federal Circuit, there would be no hearing at all, in my view,

25

in front of the Merit Systems Protection Board.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

And the reason

24
1

is because there wouldn't be anything to hear.

2
3

QUESTION:

Yes, but there is a hearing before the

Department of the Navy.

4

MR. NOLD:

Not under 7513.

5

QUESTION:

It doesn't require it, but didn't they

offer your client a hearing?

7

MR. NOLD:

They did.

QUESTION:

Well, and it was before the Agency which

is exactly what 7532 would have given you a right to have.
MR. NOLD:

That's it.

You don't get the right

QUESTION:

Even if you question the facts?

23

MR. NOLD:

Even -- there is no provision that I'm

similar, I believe, to the kind of review that you would get

20

under the Administrative Procedures Act.

And the scope of review was defined
And it's very

It's an arbitrary and capricious standard and the

21
22

courts look to see whether or not the law was followed and

23

whether or not there was substantial evidence to support the

25

Now, I'm trying to imagine what the court would be

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

26
1

looking at in a case where the only questions were: does he or

2

does he not have a clearance, was the clearance required as a

3

part of his job, and were minimal due process standards

4

granted.

5

That could all be put on one page.
QUESTION:

How about a case where the only

6

requirement is that he be admitted to the bar, and they show

7

that he's been disbarred.

8

to inquire into the propriety of his disbarment?

9

MR. NOLD:

Do you think the Board has a right

Absolutely not.

And the reason that they

10

don't is that the Supreme Courts of our States have very

11

elaborate rules that have considerable due process rights built

12

into them, and there would be no way that the Merit Systems

13

Protection Board would have any control whatsoever over that.

14

QUESTION:

Well, when why should you treat the Navy

15

Department's security clearance system as so totally different

16

from the State requirements for admission and remaining in the

17

Bar?

QUESTION:

The person

But supposing that a particular job in the

5

Navy calls for someone of field grade say of Lieutenant

6

Commander, and this fellow was a Lieutenant Commander but he's

7

reduced in rank to a lieutenant, and therefore the civilian

8

side of the Navy says, well, you no longer have the

9

qualification to fill this job.

10
11

Now, do you think the Merit System Protection Board
can review whether or not he was properly demoted?

12

MR. NOLD:

No, I absolutely do not.

13

QUESTION:

Well, there are some kinds of decisions,

14

then -- collateral, as you call them — that the Merit System

Protection Board shouldn't review?

16

MR. NOLD:

That's true.

17

QUESTION:

And why should the denial of a security

clearance be one of them?
MR. NOLD:

Because it's one and the same person

that's doing the removal.

a civilian half?

18

MR. NOLD:

Well, the interest that's being protected

19

when you're talking about a military decision is the same

20

interest that you want to protect to make sure that everybody

21

in the platoon is marching in the same direction.

22

not what we have in this national security question matter.

And that's

23

You've got to have absolute control in the military.

24

QUESTION:

25

Let me ask you something about the

statutory structure here.

Heritage

The test for security clearance

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

29
1

under the executive order is whether the employment of the

2

individual in the job would be clearly consistent — clearly

3

consistent with the interests of the national security.

4

that's a fairly strict test.

5

Now,

There are two basic sections of the CSRA 43, which

6

you mentioned earlier, which permits removal for poor job

7

performance.

8

basis of substantial evidence?

And the MSPB reviews those determinations on the

9

MR. NOLD:

Substantial evidence, right.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

And Congress did it that way •

11

because Congress, as I recall the legislative history, knew

12

that it's hard to prove.

13
14

MR. NOLD:

Well, the Congress wanted to give the

ability to fire people.

15

QUESTION:

That's right, and it's hard to prove

16

inadequate performance, so they said substantial evidence will

17

do there.

18

Then it has Section 75 which has a different review

19

standard for the MSPB.

20

evidence, more likely than not.

21

There, it's preponderance of the

Now, if Congress did want to have these things

22

reviewed, I find it incredible that it would want them reviewed

23

under 75, under a preponderance standard.

24

than not that this was clearly consistent, clearly consistent

25

with the interests of the national security.

Heritage

It is more likely

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

30

That's a very strange test.

1

If I were going to have

2

that reviewed, I would have had it reviewed under Title 43,

3

Chapter 43 which would be there is substantial evidence that

4

this would not be clearly consistent with the interests of the

5

national security.
MR. NOLD:

6

I think it should be removed even a step

7

further, and under Chapter 7532, because that's the same test.

8

That talks about things where continued employment is clearly

9

consistent with the interest of national security.

It's the

10

same test as you have with the revocation of the clearance

11

itself.

That is my point.
What the Navy has done in this case is that they've

12

13

really changed the standard under 7513.

They've changed the

14

standard from one of being clearly consistent with the interest

15

of national security to replace the standard that says you

16

can't fire somebody unless it's for such cause as would promote

17

the efficiency of the Service.
So by a two-step process, they have changed the

18
19

standard under 7513.

20

standard as you have in the revocation of the security

21

clearance.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Because that is precisely the same

Yes, but that assumes the security

decision is subject to review.
MR. NOLD:

Well, Justice Scalia, when he was a Judge,

I believe, wrote an opinion about that in the D.C. Circuit.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

31
1

QUESTION:

He's still a Judge.

2

QUESTION:

We think he still is a Judge.

3

QUESTION:

Thanks, fellas.

4

MR. NOLD:

They tell us we're supposed to call you

5

justices.

6

And you examined that whether or not a due process

7

interest attached to a security clearance, and I believe — or

8

a liberty interest attached to a security clearance — and the

9

holding was that it did not attach when you didn't get the

10

clearance because of some unspecified reason.

11

But in this case, Mr. Egan is having his clearance

12

taken away for very specified reasons that have been set out

13

and that appear to me to constitute misconduct, which then is

14

bootstrapped, if you will, over into a removal action which

15

this Court has consistently held an employee of his status has

16

a property right in his job, under Arnett v. Kennedy and those

17

other cases that talk about that.

18

So I believe that what the decision does in the MSPB

19

is to convert that standard from 7532 and cause it to be

20

enforced under 7513.

21

that.

22

such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service, was

23

to give the employee who was told that he was going to be fired

24

and specific reasons for his termination, to give the employee

25

the opportunity to cross examine the person or the witnesses

Clearly, Congress did not intend to do

I think what they intended when they talked about as

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

32
1

that would testify against him, and possibly correct a

2

situation that might be wrong.

3

He can't do that under the system that is advanced by

4

the Navy in this case.

5

found objectionable by the Federal Circuit.

6

QUESTION:

And I believe that that was what was

Mr. Nold, I'm trying to think if what

7

Congress would have done to be sure that the MSPB would handle

8

this thing the way that you're saying they expected it to.

9

the analogy that comes to my mind is that when this Court was

And

10

in the same position that the MSPB is in, that is to say,

11

before the 1976 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act

12

were adopted, we were asked to review, among other things, one

13

of the exemptions to the Act is whether the information was

14

classified in the interests of national security.

15

And we decided that that was not an invitation for us

16

to go into whether the classification was correct or not.

17

just looked into whether it was classified or not.

18

Congress didn't like that and they therefore provided that we

19

would look into whether it was properly classified.

20

without saying that, we just didn't go behind the determination

21

that it was classified.

22

23
24
25

We

Now,

But

It seems to me that this is exactly the same kind of
thing that the MSPB is confronted with.
MR. NOLD:

Well, certainly under the FOIA, the courts

even now give a great deal of due deference to --

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

33
1

QUESTION:

That's because the statute was changed.

2

But what I'm saying is that under the old statute, which reads

3

for purposes of classification the way this legislation reads

4

for purposes of security clearance, we thought it appropriate

5

as a Court to say, well, it means we look to see whether it's

6

classified, not whether the classification is proper.

7

You want the MSPB to look into not merely whether the

8

fellow doesn't have a security clearance, but whether it was

9

proper to deny him a security clearance.

10
11

It's certainly not

what we would have done.
MR. NOLD:

I want the MSPB to look into the reasons

12

that were advanced for the revocation of that clearance.

13

misconduct was involved.

14

to have the ability to create a record about that.

15

him to have the ability to have judicial review of that record

16

so that some court can later look back and say whether or not

17

he was denied something arbitrarily or capriciously.

That's what I want.

If

I suppose then you would rather have the
