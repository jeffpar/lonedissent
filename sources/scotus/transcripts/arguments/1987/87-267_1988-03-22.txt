ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW RINKER, JR., ESQUIRE

10

ON BEALF OF THE APPELLANT

11

MR. RINKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

12

the Court, in this case for the first time since its

13

decision in the Complete Auto Transit versus Brady the Court

14

is faced with a question of whether a state may constitu­

15

tionally impose a direct use tax on the value of goods while

16

those goods are still in the stream of interstate commerce.

17

Appellant Holmes is a Louisiana corporation

18

operating department stores in Lousiana and three other

19

states.

21

catalogues in New York for the design, creation, printing

22

and distribution of its catalogues.

During 1979 to 1981, Holmes as a part of its

In turn, these catalogue designers contracted

in which Holmes does its retail business. At no time did

3

Holmes or any of its agents or employees have any contact

4

with, receive or take possession of the catalogues which

5

had been mailed directly from the out of state post offices

6

to selected residents within the State of Louisiana.

MR. RINKER:

MR. RINKER:

Which ones?

Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama.
The facts here only apply to the -To the 82 percent of the catalogues

which actually went into the State of Louisiana.

They are in the State of Louisiana

Yes, sir.

22

will note that in the particular contract as described and

At no time did Holmes actually take title

QUESTION:

Well, what happened to any catalogues

that weren't delivered?
MR. RINKER:

If the catalogues weren't delivered

7

to the selected residents in Louisiana, the post office

8

was instructed by the instructions on the catalogue to leave

9

those catalogues with the then current resident, and if they

10

weren't distributed to the then current resident they were

11

distributed or sent back to the home store.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RINKER:

So Holmes got them back.
Holmes ultimately would get the

14

catalogues back that weren't actually distributed.

15

correct, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

That's

Even though you suggest they are

not taxable?
MR. RINKER:

Those, the ones that Holmes got

Well, Mr. Harrison, I guess, though,

that Holmes caused the distribution in Louisiana of the

Holmes -- the only activity -So is the taxable activity the causing

of distribution of the catalogues for its benefit in the

MR. RINKER:

Basically that's correct.

It's the

the catalogues to ultimately be distributed -QUESTION:

Is that not an activity that can be

taxed in the jurisdiction?
MR. RINKER:

In the court below the only incident

of taxation was causing these catalogues to be imported.

2

There was no evidence of any other activity performed by

Holmes in connection with these catalogues.

there was no evidence that Holmes placed --

For example,

Is that an insufficient activity for

a jurisdiction to impose a tax?

7

MR. RINKER:

QUESTION:

MR. RINKER:

Yes, it is.
Why?
This Court has focused on jurisdiction

ground and the other has to do with the commerce clause

ground.

14
15

QUESTION:

One is the due process

You didn't raise a due process issue

here.

16

MR. RINKER:

That's correct.

Holmes does not

17

dispute that Holmes — that Louisiana and Holmes have a

18

due process contact, but the issue here is that there is no

19

contact between the activity or the various activities

20

involved with importing the catalogues and the State of

21

Louisiana.

22

activity certainly in light of this Court's past decisions

23

on what constitutes activity subject to tax which is

24

sufficient to impose the tax.

25

QUESTION:

Simply by placing an order does not constitute

I just don't understand the argument.

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

7

1

If the activity is sufficient for due process purposes to

2

permit the taxing jurisdiction to tax, then how does the

3

commerce clause change the result?

4

MR. RINKER:

I don't agree with your premises,

5

Justice O'Connor, and that is that the activity does not

6

create the right of a state to tax.

7

operates department stores, it makes sales, it owns property,

8

creates in Louisiana the right to actually tax Holmes, but

9

the particular activity which we are talking about here,

10

and that is the distribution of catalogues, does not

11

establish a link with the State of Louisiana which allows

12

Louisiana to tax it on commerce clause grounds.

13

Holmes, because it

On due process grounds, certainly, no one can

14

argue that Holmes has great and significant contacts with

15

the State of Louisiana.

16

least as far as the way this Court has interepreted

17

so far, is that the tax has to be imposed on the activity

18

of the taxpayer within the taxing jurisdiction.

19

QUESTION:

But for commerce clause purposes at

Suppose a customer of Holmes ordered

20

from Holmes an item of equipment.

22

customer, and this customer is liable for use tax.

The customer would be liable for the use tax.
QUESTION:

MR. RINKER:

6

QUESTION:

8

But also Holmes, Holmes could be

made to collect that tax.

5

7

You are exactly correct, Your

That's correct, but -Now, I don't -- and the activity is

the receipt and use of something in Louisiana.
MR. RINKER:

You're right, Your Honor.

Holmes

9

would be required to collect a use tax, and this Court made

10

the point very clearly in its National Geographic case,

11

where the question was whether or not the State of

12

California could require National Geographic to collect a

13

use tax on sales of goods made to particular residents in

14

the State of California.

15

QUESTION:

Holmes certainly is having these

16

catalogues imported and delivered to its customers for use

17

by them in the State of Louisiana.

18
19

20
21

22

MR. RINKER:

That's correct, the customers are in

fact using the catalogues.
QUESTION:

If this were a tax on Holmes --

Why can't you tax Holmes for having

these things imported for use in Louisiana?
MR. RINKER:

Well, Justice White, as you just

23

pointed out, the person who is actually using the catalogues

24

within the State of Louisiana is the recipient, not Holmes.

QUESTION:

Yes, but Holmes is certainly having

that use provided.
MR. RINKER:

Holmes receives the benefit of

4

people's using its catalogues within the taxing jurisdiction.

5

That is certainly correct.

QUESTION:

7

MR. RINKER:

Hopefully.
Hopefully will receive them.

8

Otherwise presumably Holmes would not have ordered the

catalogues in the first place.

focus on the question of whether or not in the case of the

11

designer blue jeans or in the case of Gucci handbags, are

12

those retailers liable for use tax in Louisiana when

13

someone carries them around within the State of Louisiana?

14

Technically they are using and advertising those products

by having those particular articles of clothing or apparel

16

with them at the time.

QUESTION:

Similarly, this Court might

Could Holmes have made a dollar in

Louisiana without those catalogues?

19

MR. RINKER:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. RINKER:

Yes, they could have, Your Honor.
How?
People go and shop at Holmes and

22

have been shopping at Holmes for over 150 years, long

before catalogues ever became --

QUESTION:

MR. RINKER:

3

You mean in the Holmes store.
Somebody would still be shopping

over there also.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. RINKER:

You mean in the Holmes stores.
Yes, Your Honor, they have been

shopping at the Holmes stores, and it was not necessary for

7

the catalogues to be distributed in order for them to

purchase items from Holmes.

QUESTION:

money if it wasn't necessary?

11

MR. RINKER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RINKER:

Well, why did Holmes waste all that

Holmes at one time was contemplating -Did it have a loss or something?
No, there wasn't a loss involved,

14

Your Honor, but there are several reasons for distributing

15

catalogues other than the cases that you faced — other than

16

the situations in the cases that you faced where there is -QUESTION:

18

MR. RINKER:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And to get -- the only business they

22

were interested in was selling.

23

MR. RINKER:

25

It is for business

purposes.

21

24

There is no other

reason that I can conceive except for business purposes.

19
20

To get business.

That's correct, Your Honor, just as

Holmes -QUESTION:

And the only interest in Louisiana was

to sell something to a Louisiana citizen.

2

MR. RINKER:

That's right.

That's why Holmes

caused them to be imported.

QUESTION:

There is no doubt about it.

You say Holmes caused it to be

imported.
MR. RINKER:

That's correct, Your Honor, they

did cause it to be imported.
QUESTION:

And if they had picked them up and

delivered them themselves they would have been in trouble.
MR. RINKER:

If they had to come up and deliver

12

it themselves, there is no question that at that point

13

Holmes would have had possession and control of the

14

catalogues within the State of Louisiana.

15

and control would be sufficient to impose the tax.

16

QUESTION:

I can now see the memorandum that the

law department gave Holmes.

20

that the lawyers gave Holmes.

If you do it this way you

Is that correct?

That's basically correct.

Our

23

opponents, however, suggest that we did this solely in order

24

to avoid taxes. That is certainly not the case.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what other reason?

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202i 628-4888

12

1

MR. RINKER:

Holmes ordered its catalogues in this

2

manner because it participated in what is called the

3

Atkins Buying Organization..

4

organization in New York it obtained the design, construction,

5

printing, and distribution of catalogues at discount rates.

6

It had no control over where the catalogues were going to be

be printed.

10

In its participation with this

It had no idea where the catalogues were going to
It simply relied on its participation in this

If in fact the purchase organization had found

11

that the best arrangement could have been made with

12

Louisiana printers, it perhaps would have contracted with

13

Louisiana printers for this purpose.

14

organization didn't find that.

15

method of distributing catalogues in order to avoid

16

Louisiana taxes.

17

In fact, the

Holmes did not adopt this

We are focusing here on the obligation of a state

18

to collect a use tax versus the obligation for it to have

19

a use tax imposed upon its use of goods in the state.

20

mentioned in the National Geographic case, this Court

21

specifically pointed out the distinction between imposing

22

the obligation on Holmes to collect a use tax, which we

23

would not dispute in this case. If in fact this were a

24

situation where the taxing state was trying to get Holmes

25

to collect taxes on the value of the catalogues in the hands
Heritage Reporting Corporation
/onox in iOQo

As I

13

1

of a recipient, there would be no problem, and the state

2

could do that.
The state could impose the obligation on us.

3
4

Because we have -- because Holmes has due process contacts

5

with Louisiana, the state could require us to collect the

6

tax from the recipients.

7

clear in its decision in National Geographic by stating

8

that however fatal to a direct tax, and that is the tax we

9

are talking about here, direct tax, direct use tax on Holmes

10

on the value of these catalogues, might be, that particular

11

legal argument does not apply in the case of imposing the

12

obligation on the taxpayer to collect a use tax on someone

13

else in the taxing state who actually used the goods which

14

are sought to be taxed.

However, this Court made it very-

15

That is the basic difference in our case.

16

In this case the operating incident of any

17

activies by Holmes took place outside of the taxing state.

18

All of the manufacture and construction of the catalogues,

19

the addressing, the mailing took place out of Louisiana.

20

None of the activity sought to be taxed to constitute use or

21

distribution with Louisiana took place in the State of

22

Louisiana.

23

QUESTION:

But if one looks at the whole plan,

24

so to speak, certainly you can pick out incidents that took

25

place elsewhere, as you point out, but the idea was Holmes',
Heritage Reporting Corporation

14

1

they wanted to engender a distribution of catalogues in

2

Louisiana that would help sell their products in Louisiana.

3

There are certainly a lot of Louisiana ties.

4

MR. RINKER:

You are correct, there are a lot of

5

Louisiana ties sufficient for establishing of the due

6

process, for example.

7

this particular case the catalogues were printed in the State

8

of Georgia and were trucked through each of the states to get

9

to Louisiana, including Mississippi and Alabama, presumably

10

each of those states, if they had decided they could tax

11

goods in interstate commerce, as we are doing here, those

12

states could impose a use tax on the goods as they are

13

traveling through the state.

14

QUESTION:

But I will give you an example.

But they wouldn't have nearly the claim

15

that Louisiana would, because Holmes is located in

16

Louisiana.

17

stimulate sales in Louisiana.

18

not have any claims like that, do they?

19

If in

The stuff is going to people in Louisiana to

MR. RINKER:

Georgia and Mississippi do

But the due process contacts between

20

Holmes and the State of Louisiana exist in those states.

21

For example, if we dropped off merchandise there or

22

catalogues, those states also would have a right to impose

23

a use tax collection obligation, but presumably — and also

24

in those states since the catalogues are under our

25

possession and control in the hands of the printer, those
Heritage Reporting Corporation

15

1

states could assess a use tax on the value of the catalogue,

2

because the state in those states, at least in the State of

3

Georgia where one of the printers is located, the catalogues

4

are actually present there and we can have some control

5

over them.

6

Once goods are placed in the stream of interstate

7

commerce, no one, not even the owner, is deemed to have any

8

possession or control incident to ownership, and at all

9

times these catalogues are located in commerce.

10

QUESTION:

You say no one is deemed to have any

11

control incident to ownership when goods are placed in the

12

stream of interstate commerce.

MR. RINKER:

For purposes of use taxation.

Yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, when you add for purposes of use

taxation then you are relying on some cases of this Court?
MR. RINKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

In your earlier

18

cases prior to the Complete Auto Transit case, you pointed

19

out that goods in interstate commerce are not subject to

20

any type of direct tax.

MR. RINKER:

That's

But all of those activities took

QUESTION:

Mr. Rinker, supposing that you were

looking at this transaction from a philosophical point

of view, from on high, and you looked at what took place

in Georgia, and what took place in Louisiana, and what took

state do you think would have the greatest claim, just in

19

a perfectly common sense way, to put a tax on this

transaction?

MR. RINKER:

Assuming that there was an actual

22

transfer of title to the catalogues, which I mentioned

earlier is still in dispute, transfer of title to Holmes

states, assuming a sale had been completed there, could

2

to have exemptions for printed materials.

3

also happen to have exemptions from their sales tax for

4

merchandise that is sent outside of the state or is intended

5

for distribution outside of the state, so presumably those

6

states could have a right to tax the catalogues, but they

chose not to.

QUESTION:

Yes, but why don't you answer the

Chief Justice's question?

As to which one has the closest

contact?

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RINKER:

Yes.
The one that has the closest due

15

I think the problem is, we are trying to mix two different

16

concepts, the due process concept versus the interstate

17

commerce clause concept.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Rinker, does it make any difference

19

to you — from your response to the questions I gather

20

it doesn't -- that the tax is not upon the activity but

21

upon the property?

22

MR. RINKER:

23

QUESTION:

It —
I mean, so long as the activity would

24

justify a tax on the activity we can assume that the tax is

25

a tax on the activity as opposed to a tax on the property,
Heritage Reporting Corporation
12021 628-4888

23

1

which is what it is?

2

MR. RINKER:

Is that right?
In brief, our argument is that since

3

there are no activities by Holmes within the State of

4

Louisiana, activities being those types of activities similar

5

to the ones that this Court has addressed in its previous

6

decisions after Complete Auto, that in fact there are no

7

activities, and because of that the tax must be imposed on

8

the goods.

9

QUESTION:

But you concede that if there is an

10

activity that could be taxed as an activity, then this tax,

11

even though it is not a tax on an activity but simply a

12

property tax, must be upheld under the commerce clause?

13

MR. RINKER:

Assuming there is an activity

14

which has sufficient connexity and sufficient operating

incidences under the state statute which requires

16

distribution, then it would be subject to tax.

correct.

You are going to lose that once you

have conceded that so long as there is an activity that

12

MR. RINKER:

We just look at the whole

No, Justice Scalia.

That is not the

13

case here, because there is -- if the catalogues are

14

shipped to Louisiana and they do sit in a warehouse,

15

16

activity of storage.

17

like that in the instant case.

QUESTION:

for

We are not engaged in any activity

You would also be engaged in the

19

activity of shipping 82 percent to local residents and 18

percent to out of state residents, and your opponent argues,

21

well, this is the -- what you have got here is the

functional equivalent of that but you have just used the

So they must be claiming the right to tax the 18
percent as well as the 82 percent.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. RINKER:

But the state tax statute deals

2

with use, which can be defined as any type of use, including

storage.

4

the catalogues are stored before they are distributed, a use

5

tax can be imposed on Holmes.

6

actual distribution activity, such as in the Complete

7

Auto case, where there were -- the distribution activities

8

involved transportation of a trucking company of particular

goods, that activity of distribution is subject to tax.

Holmes does not engage in such activities when it is in the

state.

requires those catalogues to be sent to particular residents.
