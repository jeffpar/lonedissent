ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS BENNETT BUTLER, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

9

MR. BUTLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This matter is before the Court on appeal of the

10

decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court upholding the

11

constitutionality of a procedural rule requiring Appellate

12

counsel to inform the Court why issues in an appeal lack merit

13

when counsel reaches that conclusion.

14

We contend in this case that the decision of ihe

15

Wisconsin Supreme Court is in error and that the

16

Appellee's argument and the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme

17

Court is to ask this Court to redefine either the role of

18

counsel in an appeal or the nature of an appeal or both.

19

Now, ---

That is correct.

In so doing, since Wisconsin has provided by its

AL the same Lime,

this Court has held consistently

that, in fact, in discussing the due process rule, they've also

/t

essentially the purpose of Anders is to try to provide a

vj

criminal defendant with the same type of representation he

6

7

would receive if he were having a retained counsel.
So,

the Court has made that recognition in the past.

8

Basically, in this situation, Appellee concedes that the

9

purpose of this rule is to take the appeal out of the

10

11

adversarial testing process.
Now, since the Court has previously described in Polk

12

Countyv. Dodson and Evitts v. Lucey that an appeal is just

13

that, it's the adversarial testing process, and that a client

14

is deprived of due process when he has less than that.

15

effect, what they are asking the Court to do is,

16

of a no merit appeal, take the appeal out of the adversarial

17

process, redefine the nature of appeal, and give Lite c lieni

18

something less than that which he is entitled to as a matter of

19

right in Wisconsin.

very similar to the one that the Wisconsin Supreme Court

adopted in this case, and in that particular case,

to support the appeal, and then, after raising those issues,

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's not what brings you hero.

I mean, you're not complaining about saving the state money.
You're complaining about prejudice to your client.
MR. BUTLER:

That's correct.

It was the Wisconsin

Supreme Court that complained about the money.
QUESTION:

Right.

But it seems to me if you assume

that the state would come in with an opposing brief anyway,

th

only effect -- the only possible effect of making counsel slat
why he thinks it's frivolous is to enable the Court more
readily to focus on the fact that his reasons are wrong.
Don't you think if you're going to have
the other side from the state anyway, don't you think it would
more likely help than harm the individual defendant for counse
who has very bad reasons fox' thinking that the appeal is
frivolous to set forth those very bad reasons in a brief and
the Court can look at it right away?
Otherwise, all the Court knows Is, well, he*'s made
these arguments, but in his heart of hearts, he thinks it 's al
nonsense.

I don't see how your client is hurt by that.
MR. BUTLER:

Scalia,

first of all,

In answer to your question, Justice;
in Wisconsin,

the Attorney Gen

office is not supposed to file a response brief in an Anders
situation.

11

started to write out the reasons why it's clear and I find,

14

nothing to this case, and then you have to explain why, you're

15

going to be darn sure it is frivolous.

16

It's easy sometimes in a big record to say that I

17

don't think there's anything here. So, doesn't the requ.i reinenl

18

of articulating the basis for the conclusion it's frivolous

19

actually provide some protection to the client?

20

MR. BUTLER:

Actually, it does not because by

21

providing the Court with those reasons, assuming that you've

c c

T O

made an accurate determination, what you have done in that

23

situation is told the Court why the case lacks merit.

24
25

It's our position that if it is not readily apparent
from the face of the Anders brief why that case
14

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202)

628-4888

Is frivolous,

1

then perhaps counsel was wrong In making that determination.

n«.

QUESTION:

Yes, but if he is wrong, he won't be able

3

to spoil out satisfactory reasons and lte'11 change his mind.

4

But if he can just file it without stating the reasons, he's
going to go ahead and make some mistakes.
MR. BUTLER:

6

That's my point.

But the answer to that, Justice Stevens,

7

is that in that situation,

the Court can order the opposing

8

side to brief the case for the other side.

counsel to step in.

You don't need for

You don't need to increase the appellat;:

10

process. You still have an advocate's brief on behalf of 1 he

11

client.

12

The issues are still highlighted.
QUESTION:

It seems to me in that case, it would be

13

better for the lawyer to find out himself that he was initially

14

wrong in his judgment of frivolity or frivolousness, whatever

15

the right word is, and to correct it himself and say', no,

16

is some merit to it, rather than filing an Anders brief wiihout

17

an explanation and then having the state say, well, ho

18

acknowledges frivolous, so that's it.

that is an appeal. I mean,

that’s the way

there — in the Court of
