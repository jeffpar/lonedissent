CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WALTER P. DeFOREST, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. DeFOREST:

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
The issue before the Court in this case is whether a

10

district court has the authority to remand a properly-removed

11

case to the state court for a reason not set forth in 28 U.S.C.

12

Section 1447(c)?

13

In this case, the reason for the remand was because

14

the Plaintiffs voluntarily amended the Complaint after removal

15

to federal court to delete the federal cause of action which

16

had provided the basis for removal.

17

I would

first in my argument review the procedural

18

history in this case since it is a procedural case; then

19

discuss the statutory framework.

20

This Court's decision in Thermtron, which we believe

21

is controlling, and this Court's decision in the Gibbs case,

22

and finally the various policy and statutory considerations

23

that we urge the Court follow in determining that it is not

24

appropriate to create a judicial mechanism for remand beyond

25

that set forth that in the applicable statute.

This case arose in the State Court of Common Pleas in

Allegheny County.

It was filed by William and Carrie Boyle

3

against Carnegie-Mellon University, Mr. Boyle's former employer

4

and John Kordesich, Mr. Boyle's former supervisor.

5

filed in the state court alleged that Mr. Boyle's discharge and

the University's refusal to rehire him violated federal

statutes prohibiting age discrimination and state statutes

prohibiting age discrimination.

The Claim

The state tort and contract principles — had a claim

10

in there for Carrie Boyle, which was — she is Mr. Boyle's wife

11

and her claim was derivative of Mr. Boyle's claim for the

12

alleged injury to the marriage and for loss of consortium, et

cetera.
The case was timely removed and there was no contest

by the Plaintiffs as to the propriety of the removal at that

An Answer was filed.

Shortly before the termination of that discovery

8

The district court also recognized clear implication

9

— the court described it as an "implication;" I believe it is

10

a holding, of the Thermtron decision that prohibited such

11

remands, but the district court nevertheless determined that it

12

would remand the case.

13

The district court held that it would not grant

14

review as a certification under Section 1292 for an appeal, and

15

stated that the reason for that was because review was

16

available pursuant to a writ of Mandamus under the Court's

17

Thermtron Opinion.

18

We filed both an appeal and a Petition for a Writ of

19

Mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third

20

Circuit; The Third Circuit dismissed the appeal holding that

21

that was not a proper vehicle for review of the determination

22

by the district court; the Third Circuit did, in fact, set the

23

Mandamus petition down for review by a merits panel.

24
25

The Merits Panel, by a 2 to 1 vote held that the
district court erred; the Thermtron decision by this Court was

Heritage

5
Reporting Corporation

1

controlling; and in fact there had been no reason for remand of

2

this action, as provided under Section 1447(c), and accordingly-

3

issued a Writ of Mandamus.

4

A Petition for Rehearing was filed; the court en banc

5

accepted rehearing and under their internal operating

6

procedures, vacated the Panel Opinion in the Third Circuit --

7

their Grant of Rehearing vacates the Panel Opinion.

The Third Circuit heard the case en banc, and by a 5

Opinion, and accordingly denied the Writ of Mandamus.
QUESTION:

Mr. DeForest, what do you say the district

12

court should have done with this case in the posture in which

13

it was when it was ruled?

14

MR. DeFOREST:

Your Honor, we had held that the

15

district court should have, or urged the district court, to

16

retain the case.

17

it would not retain the case, it should have dismissed the

18

action without prejudice.

19
20

21

Assuming the district court determined that

And if it had retained the case, it should

have just gone on and decided all the state law questions?

QUESTION:

2

3

Was there any federal claim left at that

point?

4

MR. DeFOREST:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DeFOREST:

No, Justice Brennan.

Just the state law claim?
Once the permission was given to the

7

Plaintiff to voluntarily make the federal claim, there were

8

only remaining state law claims.
QUESTION:

9

Then there is some question whether they

10

could have retained the case under the constitutional grant of

11

power?

12

MR. DeFOREST:

Justice Scalia, I believe, and it is

13

clear that Section 1441(a) and (b) provide that these actions

14

may be removed, and under this Court's holding under United

15

Mine Workers v. Gibbs, both the federal claim and the pendent

16

state claim require one constitutional case, and that under the

17

statute, it is, I think, clear that, as one constitutional case

18

the district court had the power to dispose of that-case, once

19

it had accepted remand.

20

QUESTION:

Well, it is a constitutional case when it

21

is removed, because there is a federal question in it when it

22

is removed.

23

how can you say that there is a case or a controversy any

24

longer arising under the laws of the United States?

25

But once the federal question in it is excised,

MR. DeFOREST:

Heritage

Justice Scalia, the work of this Court

7
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

in the case of St. Paul Indemnity Casualty Co., has I believe,

2

addressed that issue, and held that an amendment held after

3

removal, is not a basis for the defeat of removal jurisdiction

4

once it has attached, and we believe that Congress had an

5

appropriate power to permit the, under 1441(a), federal courts,

6

to take these cases.

7

Similarly, in the Gibbs case itself, this Court made

8

clear that there are — can be, situations in which the

9

district court may determine to retain a case, even

10

notwithstanding dismissal of a federal claim, and I think,

11

Justice Scalia, in the given case itself, the facts in Gibbs,

12

if we look at it where a situation where there was a Section

13

303 claim under the Labor Management Relations Act, as well as

14

the state law claims, and the Court, I believe in that case, on

15

the facts of it that, notwithstanding the fact that the federal

16

claim properly was dismissed, that a jury verdict on the state

17

law claim could have been maintained on a procedural ground.
In that case,, because of this Court's interpretation

18
19

of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, they found that the Norris-

20

LaGuardia Act precluded that particular type of cause of

21

action, so in my judgment, Congress did appropriately determine

22

that these cases could be maintained and —

Justice Marshall, I believe that

The federal question

Under normal procedure, would it go back?

MR. DeFOREST:

Justice Marshall, there is two

23

questions: one, whether or not the federal court can keep the

24

case, and secondly, what it should do with it if it determines

25

it should not keep the case.

Heritage

Those are two separate issues.

QUESTION:

1

On what grounds would they keep it?

MR. DeFOREST:

2

Well, Justice Marshall, it is this

3

Court's decision in Gibbs does indicate that in some situations

4

that the federal courts can keep it.

5

this Court's decision in the St. Paul Indemnity & Casualty

6

case, where there was an amendment after the removal of the

7

case, to reduce the amount of the damages claimed, below the

8

jurisdictional amount, so there was no longer a federal

jurisdiction, this Court held that that amendment could not and

I would also say that

would not, mean jurisdiction.

11

issue previously and held, and I think there is longstanding

12

law on this issue, that the federal court, if it determined it

13

appropriate, would have had jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

14

So the Court has addressed this

Mr. DeForest, a long time ago, someone

15

asked you what the courts should do, and among the options you

16

stated, it should dismiss.

QUESTION:

It is just his hard luck?

MR. DeFOREST:

I suggest that that is one factor that

the, the district court might want to consider in determining
whether or not to dismiss the case or to keep it.

It is not

crucial to my position that the federal court —
QUESTION:

Or to remand it?

MR. DeFOREST:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

Or to remand it?

MR. DeFOREST:

My position on that is, which I would

like to address right now, is that the statutes on remand have
very clearly specified over a long history over a hundred
years, the bases on which cases may properly be remanded.
QUESTION:

Where do you find the express statutory

authority for the Court to dismiss to dismiss the case after
removal?
MR. DeFOREST:

Justice O'Connor, I believe that under

this Court's decision under United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that
was an option available to the district court.
QUESTION:

It certainly is not based on any express

statutory provision, is it?
MR. DeFOREST:

I believe that the Court's decision in

Gibbs was not based on statutory provision.

And I would like

to indicate —
QUESTION:

Right.

And similarly, perhaps, the option

QUESTION:

1

Well, Justice, I would like to address

2

that:

it seems to me that there are several factors that are

3

crucial here.

4

creation and a creature of statute, and remand is purely a

5

creation and a creature of statute.

6

this case that there is some sort of general power, that is a

7

very far-reaching issue, in my judgment not limited to removal

8

cases.

9

know how you are going to say it is limited to removal cases.

First of all, removal jurisdiction is purely a

If the Court determines in

Because if you are going to create some power I do not

But the removal statutes themselves, you have a long

10
11

history of very careful delineation of bases in which to permit

12

remands.

13

You do not have that in the Gibbs type situation.
Secondly, Gibbs, and the Gibbs decision arises based

14

on a longstanding traditional power of the court system to

15

dismiss cases.

16

made very clear that that is an inherent and deep-rooted power

17

in the district courts.

18

Rules that provide for dismissal.

And this Court in the case of Link v. Wabash

We also have in the Federal Rules

19

We have no such counterpart in the remand area.

In

20

fact, we have direct contrary congressional intent in the

21

removal area, because it specifically provides very limited

22

situations — only two, in which remand may be permitted under

23

the removal statutes.

24

Sections 1447(c)

Those two situations are set forth in

They set it forth in 1441(c) for a discretionary power whenever

Is there any real disagreement about the

I do not think there is either, and I

wonder why you are dwelling on it so?
MR. DeFOREST:

12

Well, because I suggest to you, by the

13

fact that Congress has provided in Section 1441(c) for a

14

discretionary power, it very clearly knew how to create this

power.

MR. DeFOREST:

That is correct, and I will also say

QUESTION:

they wished to.

3

mind; here they did it in another section of the statute, so

4

1441(c) makes pretty clear they knew how to do it if they

5

wanted it done.

It was not just something in the back of their

It is important to remember in my judgment, that

6

7

removal in this Court in the Shamrock Oil and Gas case made

8

very clear the removal area, because of a long history of

9

statutory regulation — in fact, the Court said, "the policy of

10

the success of Acts of Congress regulating the jurisdiction of

11

the federal courts, is one calling for strict construction of

12

such legislation.
We are dealing here in the removal area with

interpretation of legislation.

case.
MR. DeFOREST:

Thermtron was a case in which — I do

3

not believe it was diversity: I believe it was a case in which

4

there was a remand for a reason of the judge saying that there

5

was a crowded docket.

6
7

Now, I understand there was a diversity aspect to the
case, but my view of it is that the Court.

8

QUESTION:

How did they get out of the state court?

9

MR. DeFOREST:

I agree, it was a diversity — it was

10

initially a diversity case —

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DeFOREST:

Yes, that is why it was removed.
Yes, but I was going to say that this

13

Court's decision was not in any way conditioned upon the fact

14

that it was a diversity case.

15

QUESTION:

The Court said —

Well, the fact is, we did not have a

16

federal question case before us.

17

MR. DeFOREST:

Well, I would urge the Court, where

18

Congress has passed a statute that says a diversity case is

19

removable, that there is just as much a right in that situation

20

for somebody to be in federal court as if the Congress had

21

passed a statute saying "age discrimination is illegal."

22

So I personally believe both diversity cases and

23

jurisdiction for diversity cases and a jurisdiction for age

24

discrimination cases is conditioned upon congressional statute,

25

Justice, and that is why I am saying that I do not believe that

Heritage

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the diversity there was contingent — was a factor in the

2

determination.

3

The Court said --

QUESTION:

The difference is in that the reason it

4

was in the federal court survived and still existed at the time

5

of the remand, which is not true here.

6

it does not make any difference, but at least the difference --

7

MR. DeFOREST:

That does not mean that

No, that is a difference — there is a

8

difference there, Justice, and I would address that by saying

9

that obviously there are many reasons why claims, whether they

10

be federal, initial federal claims under federal statutes, or

11

diversity statutes, are removed from cases.

12

And this Court dealt with one in Gibbs, where in fact

13

the federal claim was in fact held.

14

was also held that in state courts a judgment could have been

15

maintained.

16

reasons of interpretation of the Morris-LaGuardia Act, so what

17

my suggestion is is that there is in fact that factor, but I do

18

not think it is a distinction.

19

It was dismissed, but it

In that case they determined not to do it for

QUESTION:

You are asking about discretion, which I

20

guess is what we are talking about:

do you think that the

21

district court would have had discretion to grant a Motion to

22

Abstain Pending the Plaintiff's Attempt to Refile, and get a

23

ruling on the statute of limitations question in the state

24

court, and then just hold the case until it finds out what

25

happens in the state court, and then dismiss?

Or either to go

ahead and dismiss and then go ahead and retry it?
MR. DeFOREST:

Justice Stevens, I do not believe that

3

that type of abstention is authorized under any of the

4

abstention doctrines that I am familiar with under Younger,

5

Pullman, or Burford.

6

appropriate type of abstention in my opinion.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think the judge would have the

8

power to do that?

9

there anything to restrict his power to do that?

10

Maybe it has not been done before, but is

MR. DeFOREST:

It would be creating a new basis for

11

abstention, Mr. Justice, and I guess if you wanted to do it,

12

you, the Court, probably could, but — so I cannot say that you

13

cannot create it, but it does not seem to me to be — I mean,

14

the Court's -- the district courts, as a practical matter, in

15

the administration of cases would have to deal with many

16

different contingencies and factors.

17

QUESTION:

And they make many --

Of course, one consideration, federal

18

judges, if they can get state judges to decide state law

19

issues, they kind of like to do it that way.

MR. DeFOREST:

I can understand that, Justice, but it

seems to me that the basic — so I suppose that there could be

22

an abstention for the purpose —

about is whether the statute of limitations had run, and so why

abstentions which I am —

MR. DeFOREST:

The Plaintiffs did.

They deleted and

This Court has so-

I would just like to state, too, a few policy
considerations.

One, it seems clear to me that Congress, which

10

knew how to create this power, did so in certain sections of

11

the statute, did not create it here.

12

Secondly, that if this court would create such a

13

power, it would be — make meaningless the creation of that

14

power to remand set forth in the limitations in Sections

15

1447(c) and in 1441(c).

16

It would also in my opinion be an unwieldy situation

17

in the district courts where the district courts now, contrary

18

to the rule of this Court in Thermtron, and in the case of

19

Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell, where the Court said, "the

20

appellate courts are not to get into reviews here of these

21

things, but just determine whether there is a power there."

22

Once we create this additional power, non-statutory

23

power, to remand, we are now saying to the circuit courts, you

24

are going to have to somehow administer that; we are going to

The state court judge has nothing to do with removal at all,

does he?

If a Petition for Removal is filed, the case is

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. OPSITNICK:

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court :
While the District Court has clearly the ability to

13

dismiss pendent state claims, I believe also the Court has the

14

power in this case to remand those pendant state claims and

15

return them to the state court.

16

This case, unlike the situation in Thermtron, is a

17

pendent jurisdiction case.

18

with certain state law claims that arise from a common nucleus

19

of operative fact.

It is a federal law claim linked

There has been no debate to that point.

20

As a result, this case is controlled by the doctrine

21

of pendant jurisdiction that began, I believe, as Mr. DeForest

22

said, by the Oswald or the Osborne case in the 1800s, and was

23

most recently discussed by this Court in the Gibbs case.

As Mr. DeForest pointed out, there

are two types of remand in the statute.

The mandatory remand

under 1447(c) which everybody agrees does not apply, and the

discretionary remand, that in 1441(c), although there is some

would not be removable as pendent under 1441(b), there should

you are using the two interchangeably — pendent question and

I am in this context, and I do not

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. OPSITNICK:

I do not either, so I will not correct it.
Mr. Chief Justice, the case — the

21

basis for the removal in Thermtron was the diversity.

22

basis for the removal in the present case is the existence of a

23

federal question.

24
25

The

The Thermtron decision concentrated primarily — the
primary thrust was whether not so much that mandamus should

Reporting Corporation

issue, but whether the matter should be reviewed at all.

That

2

is not an issue in this case.

3

holds in part when it gets to near the end of the Opinion,

4

where it indicates that mandamus should indeed issue in this

5

case because there was no basis to remand, no valid basis to

6

remand the case to state court, it says in essence that,

7

because there was no foundation at all, having the phrases,

8

"resting on grounds having no warrant in the law," and "not

9

limiting it strictly to the statute."

In fact, the Thermtron decision

For those reasons, I believe that the holding of this

10
11

Court in Thermtron is non-applicable to this situation.

12

the discretion that the district court would have to remand the

13

case under Gibbs and pendent jurisdiction, can be dealt with

14

consistently with the holding of this Court in Thermtron, that

15

indeed, non-1447(d), 1447(c), remand cases, can be reviewed

16

under mandamus and strictly in Thermtron, mandamus should

17

issue.
QUESTION:

18

That

Thermtron also discussed, and in the first

19

part of the Opinion, the provision of 1447(c) about the

20

circumstances under which a district court could remand, could

21

it not?

22

MR. OPSITNICK:

Yes, it did.

The circumstances under

23

1447(c) where it must remand, the 1447(c) type of remand when

24

there is a lack of jurisdiction or the removal was improvident,

25

is mandatory.

QUESTION:

What other types of remand are there

2

provided by the statute?

MR. OPSITNICK:

In 1441(c), as pointed out by Justice

4

Scalia, there is a discretionary remand, where the removal is

QUESTION:

MR. OPSITNICK:

12

13

It is not.

This is not a 1441(c)

So what kind of a remand is yours?
It is a remand pursuant to the

admittedly non-statutory doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

In other words you are saying that the

14

district court may, under some circumstances remand in areas

15

not specified under the removal and remand statutes?

16

MR. OPSITNICK:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

And is there any case from our Court that

18

says a district court does have authority to remand in a

19

situation where a remand is not authorized by the statute?

20

MR. OPSITNICK:

I have not found one.

Because, as it

21

was mentioned, Gibbs was not a removal case, remand was not a

22

viable alternative.

23

that logically remand in this case would follow under the

24

directive or under the ability, of the local court in Gibbs to

25

dismiss without prejudice.

MR. OPSITNICK:

Under an analysis of those factors,

with the district court making the finding that it did, that

QUESTION:

Mr. Opsitnick, can I ask you sort of the

same kind of question that I was asking Mr. DeForest:

it is my

10

guess that if a federal court remands under 1441(c), which is a

11

specific congressional authorization to remand, it is my guess,

12

although I have not heard argument on it, that the state court

13

would have to take the case back.

14

Now, under the remand that you are proposing to us,

15

would the state court have to take the case back?

16

would because it was properly filed in the state court to begin

17

with, and this comes from our inherent powers.

MR. OPSITNICK:

I think they

We have an

the power, the obligation to permit that case to proceed.

law obligation?

QUESTION:

What Justice Scalia is suggesting and you

are apparently agreeing with him, the duty to go forward with

state duty.

13

I just question that.

MR. OPSITNICK:

Well, I say that I believe I say that

14

while I am certainly not solid on that point, because as

15

Justice Marshall said, it is something that has not, or

16

presumably would not come up, I would think my basis would be

17

under state law, since the case was timely filed and served

18

properly, that they under state law have an obligation to

19

proceed with the litigation until such time as it would be --

20

go to verdict or be dismissed on some other valid basis, but I

21

do not think they could reject it out of hand just by virtue of

22

the fact that, "we have not had this case."

Has there been any indication from the

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

17

MR. DeFOREST:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.

18

First I would like to emphasize one very important

consideration that has not been considered:

there is a very

important difference between remand and dismissal, and that is

21

in regard to the scope and nature of appellate review.

22

that is a very important factor to a litigant, as I can say.

And

If we are talking about remands, there are going to

be situations in which there is much more limited scope of

25

review.

If you are talking about dismissals it is very clear

45

that the courts have set up a very strict mechanism for
