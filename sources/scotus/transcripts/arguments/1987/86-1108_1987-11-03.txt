CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Ms. Harritt, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. HARRITT, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MS. HARRITT:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

This cause is before this Court on a writ of

10
11

Thank you.

certiorari from a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court.
That Court erroneously held that this Respondent's

12

Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination

13

was violated by the state's pre-sentence investigative process.

14

At the pre-sentence investigation interview, where the

15

Respondent was given the choice of participation or not, the

16

Respondent made statements that the Judge considered at the

17

later sentencing hearing.

18

The Vermont Supreme Court also committed error beyond

19

the compulsion decision when it mistakenly relied on Estelle v.

20

Smith and held that the Respondent's sentence had been enhanced

21

despite the fact that Respondent's exposure to his criminal

22

responsibility remained the same as his exposure following his

23

nolo contendere pleas.

24

25

The state's court's decision improperly extended the
Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination
3

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

on these facts and created an unwarranted obstacle to the

2

individualized sentencing process.
Turning briefly to the facts, the record reveals that

3
4

the Respondent entered three pleas of nolo contendere at a

5

change of plea hearing, at which time the Court ordered a pre­

6

sentence investigation report. This order was made in the

7

presence of counsel and Respondent, pursuant to Vermont

8

practice.
QUESTION:

9

Ms. Harritt, does the record indicate

10

whether either the Court or the probation officer told the

11

Respondent the purpose of the interview?
MS. HARRITT:

12

No, the record doesn't indicate whether

13

or not the Respondent was told by the Court or the probation

14

officer.

15

spelled out in both criminal rules as well as the statutes in

16

addition to Vermont practice.

However, the purpose of the interview is clearly

The pre-sentence investigation report, in fact,

17
18

follows a prescribed format that is known to all practicing —

19

persons — pardon me — practicing criminal law and certainly

20

since the attorney for Respondent was a public defender, the

21

format was not a surprise to her.
QUESTION:

22

Well, does the record indicate whether the

23

public defender had notice of the time that interview would be

24

given?

25

MS. HARRITT:

No, the record doesn't reveal notice as
4

1

to the precise time when the interview would take place.

2

However, it's clear from the practice in Vermont that the

3

interview did not take place immediately after the change of

4

plea hearing, and, so,

5

counsel to prepare her client knowing the purpose of the report

6

and the fact that the admissions of the Defendant, had he chose

7

to submit to the interview, should be considered.

MS. HARRITT:

Yes, that's correct.

Well, he's left the jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

What kind of a case do we have here?

MS. HARRITT:

QUESTION:

MS. HARRITT:

Well, we submit that the case —

A dead case.
Well, I would respectfully disagree,

sentencing should take place with a new report prepared, and

There is a

That's correct.

And now they can bring him back for re­

sentencing?
MS. HARRITT:

Well, that's because he might — if he

22

is re-sentenced, he could face not just a lower sentence, but a

23

deferred sentence which, if he were to satisfy the conditions

24

of the deferred sentence, his conviction would be expunged,

thereby avoiding any collateral consequences that attend

conviction.
QUESTION:

But he's the one that has to initiate

taking advantage of that option, doesn't he?
MS. HARRITT:

Well, the Court, lower court, — there

5

is now a lower court order which mandates that there be re­

6

sentencing in this case. Certainly, the state intends to try to

7

obtain his whereabouts and return him to the jurisdiction.

8

QUESTION:

Well, how are you going to return him?

9

How can you force his return?

10

MS. HARRITT:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. HARRITT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. HARRITT:

Well, it's —

If he's outside of the state?
Well, it's in his interests to return.

Why is it? He served his term.
Well, that's true, but I'm sure the

15

Court would agree that if the conviction was expunged for these

16

— if there was no record of these convictions, he would be put

17

in a much better position.

18

QUESTION:

He would have --

Yes, but aren't you overlooking something?

19

If he comes back in and says please sentence me again,

20

not possible that he could get a longer sentence?

21

MS. HARRITT:

22

QUESTION:

Well,

is it

that's an option.

Do you think a lawyer would advise him to

23

come back, saying I realize you've served your sentence, but if

24

you take a shot at getting the whole thing expunged, of course,

25

you might have to spend another year in jail, but what do you
7

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

want to do?

Can you imagine a lawyer asking for that risk,

2

after he's served his sentence, to go back in and take a chance

3

at getting exposed to another sentence?
MS. HARRITT:

4

He certainly runs that risk, but our

5

understanding of the mootness doctrine is — would have this

6

Court rule on the merits of the case because there still is a

7

controversy. There is an opportunity or a benefit that could be

8

obtained by the Respondent. He may not obtain that benefit, but

9

it exists nonetheless.
QUESTION:

10

What benefit can you get out of winning

11

this case, except an opinion that you would like?

12

the rule of law would be something that interests you.

13

far as your fight with this Defendant, what are you going to

14

get that you haven't already gotten?
MS. HARRITT:

15

I understand
But as

Well, we would like the opportunity to

16

have the case resolved, and we would like the sentence not

17

vacated —

QUESTION:

Will you ask for a more severe sentence if

he comes back?
MS. HARRITT:

Well, the Attorney General's office was

not the prosecuting entity.
QUESTION:

A different —

If you don't, you don't have any interest

in the outcome of the case.

MS. HARRITT:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

22

if this Court were to —

Extradite him?

There is the order. What are you going to do about it?

12

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Well, he runs —

You would have him committed to an insane

MS. HARRITT:

1

2

I would like to continue with the

facts, if I may.
At the change of plea hearing, the pre-sentence

3
4

investigator report was ordered, and as I've stated, counsel

5

and the Respondent did have notice and opportunity to consult

6

concerning whether or not the Respondent should submit to the

7

interview and they also had a chance to confer concerning its

8

scope and application to the sentencing process.
At a later unspecified time, the probation officer

9
10

arrived at the Correctional Center where the Respondent was

11

incarcerated and attempted to start the interview.

12

time, the Respondent sought to postpone the interview asking

13

that the probation officer wait until the arrival of the

14

defense investigator.

At that

At that juncture, the probation officer indicated

15
16

that she could not wait but that the Respondent had the choice

17

of continuing in the absence of the defense investigator or

18

foregoing the interview at that time.
QUESTION:

19
20
21
22

Does the record show why she couldn't

wait?
MS. HARRITT:

No, there is not a specific explanation

given for that.

23

QUESTION:

Wouldn't have taken very long, would it?

24

MS. HARRITT:

25

QUESTION:

We don't know that, Your Honor.

Well, the investigator was on the way,
10

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

wasn't he?
MS. HARRITT:

2

That's what was stated, but we, of

3

course, don't know whether he would have arrived in ten minutes

4

or in two hours.
Turning to the compulsion argument, it's clear that

5
6

the Court must find compulsion in order for the privilege

7

against self-incrimination to have been violated.

8

compulsion in this case. The Respondent was given the option of

9

going ahead with the interview or foregoing the interview.

10

The probation officer made no threats concerning

There is no

11

whether or not if he exercised the choice some dire consequence

12

would attend.
QUESTION:

13
14

And you say that is not coercion of any

kind?

15

MS. HARRITT:

16

a choice, but it's not coercion.

17

QUESTION:

No.

It certainly put the Defendant to

How would you feel if you were

18

incarcerated and this was thrown at you?

19

you were a little pushed at all?

20

MS. HARRITT:

Would you feel that

Well, it's a choice.

There are

21

certainly weighty decisions that all persons make when they're

22

involved in the criminal process, and I'm sure it would give me

23

some reason to pause, and I would try to consider my options,

24

but I don't think —

25

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly is a little different
11

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

than the ordinary day-to-day decisions.
MS. HARRITT:

2

He was incarcerated.

We don't think that his situation as an

3

incarcerated individual created any additional pressure or

4

coercion.

5

QUESTION:

Just like you and I living outside?

6

MS. HARRITT:

Well, the individual had been at the

7

Correctional Center for a few months.

8

opportunity to confer with counsel, to decide whether or not to

9

submit to the interview process in the first place, and the

10
11

He had had the

probation officer said, if you'd like to go ahead now, —
QUESTION:

But the record doesn't tell us whether the

12

Defendant was ever told about the purpose of the interview or

13

whether he could participate in it or not.

14

MS. HARRITT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. HARRITT:

17

QUESTION:

Well, it —

Does it?
It doesn't, but we submit that —

Does the record tell us anything about the

18

purpose of the state in refusing to wait or why it put the

19

Defendant to the immediate choice it did?

20
21
22
23
24
25

MS. HARRITT:

No, the record doesn't speak to that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Does the State of Vermont law make it

optional with a defendant to participate in a PSI interview?
MS. HARRITT:

Yes, it does.

The criminal rules

permit the Court to dispense with the pre-sentence
12

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

investigative report if the defendant or respondent does not

2

wish to participate.

3

So, that was certainly his option.

It would be unreasonable for the Defendant to have

4

assumed that there would be a penalty here.

5

because there are alternative means by which he can put forth a

6

picture of who he is, so the Court can consider his mitigating

7

characteristics at sentencing.

8

9

He lost nothing

As this record demonstrates, defense counsel
submitted written affidavits from the victims, and there is

10

nothing in the rules that precludes even the submission of a

11

written statement from the Defendant himself.

12

So, there clearly exists documentary roots by which

13

material can be presented for the Court's consideration at

14

sentencing.

15

Additionally, the rule provides for an opportunity

16

for allocution, both from defense counsel as well as the

17

Respondent, and at the sentencing hearing, Respondent can rebut

18

the accuracy of any material that is conveyed in the pre­

19

sentence investigation report.

20

QUESTION:

Can I ask you — I'm sorry to interrupt

21

your argument on the merits, but is it correct, the Respondent

22

had already served his sentence at the time the case was

23

decided by the Vermont Supreme Court?

24

was in 1986, which it seems to be about three years after the

25

sentencing date.

I noticed their decision

MS. HARRITT:

QUESTION:

MS. HARRITT:

11
12

I think he was still serving

His sentence was eighteen months, wasn't

6

9

At the

Yes, with credit for time served.

And he was sentenced in 1983, I think.
He was sentenced in January of 1984, if

I'm not mistaken.
QUESTION:

January of '84. So, then, by October-of

'86, he would have served his sentence.
Does the Vermont Supreme Court have jurisdiction as a

13

matter of state law to render advisory opinion or do they have

14

the same kind of doctrine we do?

15

MS. HARRITT:

16

I think it's similar to this Court,

Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

It is.

18

MS. HARRITT:

Since the Respondent had the

19

opportunity to forego participation at the pre-sentence

20

interview and had these alternative means by which he could

21

supply the Court with a picture of who he was, it was

22

unreasonable for the Respondent to assume, even if he did

23

assume, and there is the absence of an assumption on his part,

24

on the record, that he would incur a substantial penalty if he

25

chose to forego the interview, we believe the state court's
14
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

''

1

decision in regard to the compulsion aspect of this case is

2

clearly erroneous as a result.

w

3

Moreover, in order for there to be a situation of

4

compulsion, the Respondent must assert his privilege against

5

compulsory self-incrimination in a timely fashion, absent

6

certain exceptions.

7

Respondent may assert that one of those exceptions

8

attends here; that is, the one relating to custody.

Petitioner

9

respectfully suggests that in this instance, given the purpose

10

of the pre-sentence investigator report and the comments that

11

were made to Respondent at the Correctional Center, that this

12

is not a situation involving custody, so as to excuse the

13

assertion of the privilege.

14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

What was the maximum sentence he could

have gotten?
MS. HARRITT:

Originally, Your Honor, he was charged

with a felony count that carried a twenty-five year maximum.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. HARRITT:

When do you deliver the maximum?
Well, he entered pleas of nolo

20

contendere to reduce charges of simple assault, which carried a

21

one-year maximum.

22

count, he received nine months.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

So, instead of receiving one year for each

And how many — well, how many were the

maximum number of months he could have gotten?
MS. HARRITT:

He could have gotten thirty-six months,
15
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

if my mathematics are correct.

2

QUESTION:

So, we're arguing about two years.

3

MS. HARRITT:

The reason this is not a situation

4

involving custody is that despite his residence at the

5

Correctional Center, he was told by the probation.officer that

6

he did not have to participate at the interview.

7

Certainly,

this is a situation where his will was not

8

overborne.

He was given the opportunity to participate in an

9

interview which would give him a chance to put forth his point

10

of view or he could forego the interview and rely on other

11

means later for presenting his mitigating characteristics.

12

Certainly, this should not be a situation given the

13

philosophy underlying Miranda to warrant the exception to the

14

assertion of the privilege.

15

QUESTION:

But he had asked for counsel?

16

MS. HARRITT:

No, Your Honor.

He had asked that the

17

interview be postponed until the arrival of the defense

18

investigator.

19

QUESTION:

But I thought the Vermont Court found that

20

that was a request for counsel.

21

MS. HARRITT:

It would appear that they did, Your

22

Honor, but we submit that that was an erroneous determination.

23

Certainly, this Court has —

So, that question may be before you,

His cause here —

Has the Respondent himself, the now­

missing Defendant, —
MS. HARRITT:

No.

The now-missing Defendant did not

file a brief with this Court.
Moving to the incrimination aspect of the privilege

8

against self-incrimination, we would ask this Court to consider

9

our argument under the heading of Enhancement.

20

We submit that even if the Court found both

2

compulsion and excuse the failure to assert the privilege that

22

the Respondent suffered no incrimination. By incrimination, the

23

state means an enhanced penalty.

24

when a witness is compelled or a respondent to testify against

25

himself and the result is exposure to a penalty or to some

criminal responsibility.
Here, by pleading nolo contendere, Respondent faced

3

particular terms of imprisonment and/or fines, and when he

4

entered his pleas, he would be sentenced in the Court's

5

discretion at the sentencing hearing.

6

the same whether or not he participated at the pre-sentence

7

investigation interview.

8
9

His exposure remained

In the absence of some enhanced penalty, we submit
that unlike the situation in Estelle v. Smith, it was wrong for

10

the Court to conclude that the Respondent's sentence had been

11

enhanced where the Government had no burden of proof and where

12

there is no additional element that had to be required prior to

13

the imposition of sentence.

14
15

If there are no further questions at this point, I
wish to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to start, first, by addressing a point
Justice Blackmun raising.
It's true, Your Honor, that a person in prison is in
18

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

a different situation than a person who is at liberty and then

2

taken into police custody.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LARKIN:

I am glad to hear you admit it.
There is no question the restraints a

5

person suffers in prison or in jail are quite real and quite

6

tangible, but the fact that he is literally in custody in that

7

sense, we do not believe requires that the Court automatically

8

hold he's also in custody for Miranda purposes.

9

When a person in the words that Miranda used is

10

"swept from a friendly environment" into a hostile environment,

11

dominated by police, he is in a position which there is a risk,

12

Miranda believes, a great risk, Miranda believes, that he will

13

be subject to trickery or intimidation or other types of ploys

14

that would work on his free will.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

So, if he's already there to begin with,

the situation is different?
MR. LARKIN:

It's not necessarily the same. There are

18

circumstances, of course, and we freely recognize it, in which

19

a person in prison would also be in — yes, we would not say

20

that the decision in the Mathis case automatically mandates

21

Miranda rulings, excuse me, Miranda requirements for every

22

prisoner before he is questioned in custody.

23

QUESTION:

24

difference is here?

25

MR. LARKIN:

You are going to tell us what the

The difference, we believe, is this:
19

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

the restraints that a person has on him in custody imposed the

2

background environment in which he must live, but those

3

restraints are not of the type that would necessarily in every

4

case lead a person to believe that he had no alternative but to

5

confess when he is confronted with someone who is asking him

6

questions.

7

That is the situation that Miranda faced and that is

8

the situation to which Miranda addressed its warnings.

9

person who is questioned about an unsolved crime in the

A

10

basement of a police station house not only has a restriction

11

on his freedom of movement, but he also has a dislocation that

12

accompanies the change in the environment from which he was

13

into the one he is in now, and there is also the insinuation by

14

the inquisitor that the questioning will not cease until a

15

confession is obtained.

16

Those factors are not necessarily present in every

17

type of prison questioning.

For example, here, the only course

18

or factor that the Vermont Supreme Court pointed to was the

19

fact that Respondent may forfeit the opportunity to engage in

20

the interview with the probation officer.

21

indicate that the Vermont Supreme Court and Respondent saw the

22

interview not as a burden but as an opportunity.

23

burden in which he had to fend off police efforts to try to get

24

him to incriminate himself, but an opportunity to persuade the

25

probation officer to write a favorable report.

That factor tends to

20

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Not as a

1

In addition, as the Court recognized in Minnesota v.

2

Murphy, one of the risks associated with questioning a person

3

in custody is that the questioning may lead the person to

4

believe that he has no free will to decide not to answer a

5

question, that it will go interminably.

6

situation here.

7

That wasn't the

From the record and from the opinion below, the

8

probation officer gave the Respondent the opportunity to decide

9

whether to go forward with the interview at the appointed time

10

in the absence of legal representation or to forego the

11

interview at all.

12

Now, that may be a difficult choice for someone in

13 " Respondent's position to make.
14
15

QUESTION:
it?

16
17

MR. LARKIN:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

We don't

know the reason why.

18

QUESTION:

19

the reason?

20

something.

21

Kind of an unnecessary choice, too, isn't

Well, who has the burden of demonstrating

Maybe she had an appointment to fix her hair or

MR. LARKIN:

We would believe that since Miranda

22

establishes an exception from the general rule that all

23

relevant evidence is admissible, the burden of showing that

24

Miranda is applicable should be on the person invoking that

25

exception. In other words, the Defendant would normally, we
21

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

believe, have the burden of establishing that he was in custody»

2

and, in this case, the only factor that Vermont pointed to to

3

show that he was in custody was he might forfeit this

4

opportunity.

5

That doesn't seem to us to be comparable to the type

6

of questioning that Miranda was addressing.

7

amicus in support of Respondent, rather, have pointed to the

8

fact that the questioning was performed by someone who is

9

outside the normal prison environment.

10
11

wasn't a therapist.

Respondent, — an

It wasn't a guard.

It

It was a probation officer.

But that fact also does not necessarily amount to the

12

type of compulsion that Miranda was designed to deal with.

13

is true, he had a difficult choice to make, but the fact that

14

he had a difficult choice to make —

15

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Larkin, would you defend a rule that

16

said that we will have these interviews for a person's pre­

17

sentence report without counsel only and if the defendant wants

18

counsel, he can't have the interview? Would that be a

19

permissible rule?

20

way they will have them is without counsel, it's up to the

21

defendant to decide whether to take advantage of it or not.

22
23

Just as a general state policy.

MR. LARKIN:

The only

Well, it's not a rule that would arise

in the Federal system because —

10

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

We have taken the position and the

state disagrees.
QUESTION:

And that is considered irrelevant as a

matter of law?
MR. LARKIN:

We don't think forcing him to that

11

choice, even if that was that type of rule, would violate his

Sixth Amendment right.

forward with allocution or something along those lines.

If there is no constitutional right to a

lawyer at an interview of this kind, basically?
MR. LARKIN:

No. He would have a constitutional right

to force him to make this type of choice.

If he wants to have

You say he would have a constitutional

22

right to have a lawyer present?

MR. LARKIN:

We believe that this would be a critical

stage of the proceedings. The state disagrees with that.

25

wants to have an attorney present in the Federal system, the

If he

probation office doesn't object.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LARKIN:

Yes. Right.
But it is not unlawful, we think, to put

4

him to a choice like this.

This isn't the type of attempt to

5

circumvent his right to counsel that the Court has had in the

6

other types of right-to-counsel cases, like Massiah or like

7

Henry or like Moulton.

8

There was an attempt to avoid —

9

QUESTION:

You either go ahead without the lawyer or

10

you don't have it. Why isn't that circumventing the right to

11

have a lawyer present?

MR. LARKIN:

Because they were open and up front and

put all their cards on the table.

that we will have the interview now or if you want your lawyer

Or at any other time because she said it's

MR. LARKIN:

Even if they had adopted that rule, we

would say that it would not violate his Sixth Amendment right.

Of course, there's some reason to doubt that that was actually

4

the rule because actually what happened here, because at page

14 of the —

That's this case.

You

7

can either forego the interview or -- you can either forego a

8

lawyer or the interview, can't have both.

9

MR. LARKIN:

On those facts, we would say it would

10

not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. If it

11

violated anything, it would be a right to present evidence at

12

sentencing.

13

of situation we had here where he's'being interviewed outside

14

of the actual allocution stage and when he would be in court,

15

if the judge said you can talk now or wait till your lawyer

16

shows up.

17
18
19

So, it may be a different circumstance in the type

QUESTION:

But I thought you said you agreed this was

a critical stage of the prosecution?
MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

We would say that he would have a

20

right, if he demanded to have his lawyer there, not to be

21

questioned in the absence of the lawyer, but they didn't

22

question him —

23

QUESTION:

But you're defending the state's right to

24

say we can force you to go through the critical stage of the

25

prosecution. If you want to have the benefit of a critical
25
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

stage of the prosecution, you must have it without a lawyer

2

present.

That's what you're saying.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LARKIN:

This isn't a required interview.
That's right.

I mean, he could have

5

foregone the interview entirely, and if he wanted the lawyer

6

present, he could demand it, but it does not, we think, violate

7

the Sixth Amendment to offer him the opportunity to go forward

8

in the absence of his lawyer, which is essentially what

9

happened here.

10
11

Now, the Sixth Amendment issue is not one that was
addressed —

12

QUESTION:

To require somebody to do something in the

13

judicial process without a lawyer does not touch the Sixth

14

Amendment?

15

MR. LARKIN:

No, we didn't say that. He wasn't

16

required.

He wasn't required to go forward with the interview.

17

He was given the option.

18

time to help persuade the probation officer that he deserved

19

probation or some other lighter sentence or to abandon that

20

opportunity at that time and talk to the probation officer.

He was given the option of using that

21

I mean, there is evidence in the record, for example,

22

at page 14 where it indicates that the probation officer called

23

the Defendant later to verify an allegation that was made by

24

s.omeone else that would go into the pre-sentence report, the

25

allegation being that the Respondent was a member of a gang.
26
Heritage Reporting Corporation

So, it doesn't necessarily seem that this was a now

to

'W'

or never situation even with the probation officer.

3

QUESTION:

Supposing it was a trial, he wanted to put

4

on his defense, he says my lawyer isn't here yet, the judge

said you either put on your defense by yourself or you can't

put on a defense, would that be a fair choice for a critical

stage?

QUESTION:

10

No. The trial is —
That's an even more critical stage.

That's the point.

12

SUPPORTING JUDGMENT BELOW

13

15

1

just as in the trial case just given,

QUESTION:

MR. HINTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in this
case is correct on at least two separate grounds.
First, the Court's finding of a Fifth Amendment

18

violation, that is, improper compulsion to give up the right to

19

remain silent, correctly decides that Mr. Cox was required by

20

the probation officer unnecessarily to give up a right

21

recognized by the Vermont Supreme Court that he had to make the

22

important decision about participating in the pre-sentence

23

investigation interview, whether to participate, whether to not

24

participate, or to what extent to participate, only after

25

consultation with counsel.
28
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

Because Mr. Cox was told by the probation officer
that he could not make a counsel but only an uncounseled
decision about participation in the interview, a choice which
wasn't even a correct statement, much less a legitimate
statement of his options under state law, his disclosure —
QUESTION:

Wasn't a correct statement of his options

under state law — why didn't the Supreme Court of Vermont go
on that ground rather than raising a federal constitutional
question?
MR. HINTON:

I think they felt that depriving, Mr.

Chief Justice, depriving him of a state law benefit, if it be
only a state law benefit to have the right to counsel before
being required to participate in the pre-sentence investigation
interview, was a valuable state benefit, and as this Court has
held in its Fifth Amendment penalty cases, when you seek to
retain a valuable, albeit state-created benefit, and the
Government says you're going to lose that benefit, if you claim
the Fifth Amendment, then the Court has found that that is
compulsion.

It makes a choice in the face of that choice to

speak involuntary.
QUESTION:

I hadn't read the Supreme Court of Vermont

opinion quite that way.
MR. HINTON:
permissible reading.

Well, I think that is at least a
I do argue that there is a Sixth

Amendment violation directly here as an alternative affirming
29

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

i

2

3
4

Well, I guess the Court below didn't

address that at all, did it?
MR. HINTON:

The Sixth Amendment?

No, no, Your

Honor, the Court didn't decide the case on any basis, any

6

feder.al basis, other than the Fifth Amendment.
The fact that the State of Vermont uses the pre­

8

sentence investigation process at all, I think we can concede,

9

is a decision that they would have to undertake as a matter of

10

federal constitutional law or possibly as a matter of federal

11

constitutional law, they wouldn't have to say that in order to

12

be given a valid opportunity, you have to be able to give the

13

counsel an opportunity to participate in the process.

14

But even if these rights are only guaranteed by state

15

law, that doesn't lessen the impropriety of conditioning the

16

right, the federal right to remain silent on giving up these

17

state benefits.

QUESTION:

r

ground.

In the Court's other cases, holding that states may

19

not condition exercise of Fifth Amendment rights on forfeiture

20

of a benefit, the benefit is typically state-created, the right

21

to employment as a police man or sanitation worker, the right

22

to bid on and to get government contracts, or the right to hold

23

political office.

24
25

The Solicitor General and the State of Vermont seem
to argue that this right isn't very important, that it's
30
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

m

1

minimized as a right that isn't important or isn't that

2

important, so that to lose that right amounts to compulsion to

3

speak.

4

decision, I think, as well as its rules and its practice

5

indicate that most people think that for a defendant who has

6

been convicted, there is nothing more important than a pre­

7

sentence investigation report and possibly there is nothing

8

more important about that report than what the defendant does

9

in response to his opportunity to offer a statement or decline

10

a statement to that report.
QUESTION:

11

1

Well, all he was coerced into doing was

12

attending the pre-sentence interview, right?

13

into saying anything that would be against his penal interests,

14

was he?

15

nice things about himself, couldn't he?
MR. HINTON:

17

QUESTION:

19

He wasn't coerced

He could have attended the interview and only said

16

18

1

Well, the ABA Standards in the Vermont Court's own

That's correct.
Was there any coercion to provide any

incriminating statements about himself?
MR. HINTON:

There was coercion for him to seize the

20

opportunity to make a statement, I maintain, and the only

21

opportunity offered him because he was told by the probation

22

officer that he would never have another chance, he made, we

23

contend, an ill-advised decision without counsel to offer

24

material that counsel well and probably should have advised him

25

not to give.
31
Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

QUESTION:

1

Well, that relates to the counsel

2

violation, which is a different one.

I mean, I understand that

3

had counsel been present, he might not have answered some

4

questions the way he did answer them.

5

was not — there was no coercion for him to make any

6

incriminating statements. There was only coercion for him to go

7

to the pre-sentence interview.

But, still and all, he

8

Isn't that an accurate statement?

9

MR. HINTON:

I think that being told that you would

10

never have another chance, incorrectly told that he would never

11

have another chance because the Vermont Court said, in fact,

12

that wasn't an appropriate choice to put him to, was coercive

13

in that —

think —
QUESTION:

But he could have gone to the interview

19

and said, you know, just nice good things.

20

coercion for him to make an incriminating statement or to

21

provide evidence against himself?

22

MR. HINTON:

Was there any

The coercion was the loss of the

23

opportunity to make a decision whether to offer any sort of

24

material with counsel.

make a decision at some point whether to participate or not.

He would have, in any scenario, had to

1

>

We're not arguing as the State and Solicitor General suggests
against the necessity of having to make a choice.

3

What we're arguing against is the necessity to have

4

to make an uncounseled choice and that inappropriate pressure

5

put on him by the requirement of that choice, we contend,

6

contributed to his decision to speak ill-advisedly.

7

QUESTION:

8

these Vermont pre-sentence investigations, I take it would you

9

say ordinarily a defendant does

10

y

MR. HINTON:

attend with counsel?

My understanding is that there's no rule

11

in Vermont that says that you can or cannot.

12

the situation is that sometimes counsel does attend, sometimes

13

counsel confers with the individual and decides to let the

14

defendant go on his own.

15

QUESTION:

My knowledge of

From what you know, is it customary for a

16

lawyer to sit there and then the probation officer to ask

17

questions and the lawyer to advise the defendant not to answer

18

on the grounds it might incriminate him?

19
20

MR. HINTON:

I am not aware if that is commonly done

or usually done.

21

1

Mr. Hinton, as a matter of practice in

QUESTION:

It strikes me that whatever the abstract

22

constitutional right of the situation may be, this is not a

23

very good way for a defendant to get a favorable pre-sentence

24

report.

25

MR. HINTON:

As a matter of fact, I think, Mr. Chief
33

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

Justice, you might be correct. I think that it might be decided

2

and maybe in many cases would be decided that the best way to

3

prepare for this is to confer maybe beforehand and then, in

4

part, to suggest to the probation officer that the defendant

5

isn't trying to somehow shield himself with counsel to have a

6

defendant go on his own.
In this case, the Vermont Supreme Court found that

7
8

although I don't see a problem in the usual case in having

9

counsel present during the interview and the Vermont Supreme

10

court didn't seem to think it was a problem, in this case, what

11

defense counsel asked for or said we were seeking to do and it

12

was short-circuited was the right to confer.
Mr. Cox said he didn't want to talk to the probation

13
14

officer until the investigator for the defense counsel's office

15

arrived.

16

person to participate and be with him throughout or only to

17

give him some information beforehand about what —

18

It wasn't clear that he necessarily wanted that

QUESTION:

And this is the equivalent of counsel in

19

the views of the Vermont Supreme Court, an investigator from

20

the defense counsel's office?

21

MR. HINTON:

For the purposes of Fifth Amendment

22

argument, I think that they certainly feel like and have

23

decided that the investigator at least should have a right to

24

investigate.

25

important in this case than counsel.

They don't view that as being anything less

34

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

For the purposes of looking at it as a federal

1

2

question, whether a request for an investigator is a request

3

for counsel, I've argued that primarily in contrast to a few

4

other cases, the Fare case and a 7th Circuit case, Franzen,

5

that just as in those cases, asking for probation officer

6

shouldn't be something that automatically equates to seeking to

7

remain silent or seeking an attorney; asking for defense

8

investigator should be treated that way.
QUESTION:

9

We've never held that, have we?

MR. HINTON:

10

No, Your Honor, you've never held that.

11

I essentially would maintain that unlike Fare and Franzen,

12

where the probation officer clearly is not, as this Court has

13

held in Minnesota v. Murphy, is not only a friend, but also

14

maybe a person with adverse interests to the defendant, a

15

defense investigator under Vermont law has — is, under the

16

rules of Vermont evidence, considered a representative of the

17

attorney and comes within Evidence Rule 502 as a person who has

18

privileged communications.

19
20

Also, as Vermont public defense system uses defense
investigators, they're paralegals. They're trained in advising.
QUESTION:

21
22

testimony.

23

You use anything.

24
25

Why do you need a lawyer?

You use hearsay.

It's not sworn

You use toilet paper written on.

Am I right?

MR. HINTON:

I think that's correct, that the rules

of evidence don't apply at sentencing.

MR. HINTON:

The

probation officer goes around and talks to the bartender.

Don't apply to the probation report.

The probation — well, —

MR. HINTON:

The probation officer — we're not

asserting the right, Justice Marshall, to have the probation

8

officer accompanied by a defense investigator or a lawyer in

9

all of his or her investigative efforts.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HINTON:

Well, why do you need it with your client?
The reason is that's a confrontation

12

between the accused and an agent of the state in which, as

13

happened in this case, the accused can, through inadvertence or

14

lack of knowledge, incriminate himself.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HINTON:

And can also get himself a low sentence.
That's right.

Client stands to possibly

17

benefit or possibly disadvantage him or herself in that

18

context. In this particular case, Mr. Cox obviously

19

disadvantaged himself in that context.

20

QUESTION:

Well, merely incriminating himself isn't

21

enough to make a Fifth Amendment case.

22

compulsion.

23

MR. HINTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

You've got to have some

That's correct.
And in the usual arrest and interrogation

situation, where counsel isn't present, the impression the
36

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

officers give is that we're going to keep you here till you

2

answer, and that's what triggered the right to have counsel

3

present.

4
5
6

But, here, it's just the opposite. If you don't want
to stay here, take off.
MR. HINTON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I don't

7

maintain that you have to presume as in the Miranda context in

8

this case compulsion.

9

compulsion here based on the probation officer's choice put to

I maintain that there was, in fact,

10

Mr. Cox that he would lose the chance to make an informed

11

decision, which the Vermont Court said he had the right to,

12

without participation or declining to participate.

13

QUESTION:

Well, he could make his choice, which is

14

worse for him, being quiet or speaking, and that's the kind of

15

choice that people have to make at trial all the time.

16

MR. HINTON:

That is the kind of choice people have

17

to make at trial. I think the McGautha v. California decision

18

indicates that there's a lot of hard choices.

19

All we're asking for in this case or all we're

20

complaining about isn't the necessity to make a choice, but the

21

necessity to make a choice without advice.

22

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that's just your

23

Sixth Amendment claim, not the Fifth Amendment claim.

24

Fifth Amendment claim, I find hard to see what the coercion is,

25

but I understand what you're arguing about is the — being
37

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

That the

1

forced to make the decision without advice of counsel about

2

whether to speak or not, whether to participate or not, and

3

that would be a Sixth Amendment claim, right?

4

MR. HINTON:

That's correct, but the way the counsel

5

issue, Justice O'Connor, fits into the Fifth Amendment argument

6

is that even if you assume that there is no Sixth Amendment

7

right to counsel conferred by the federal Constitution, which

8

we maintain there certainly should be a critical stage like a

9

PSI interview, but even if you assume there's not, there's a

10

Vermont law right to confer with counsel which the probation

11

officer in this case did not respect, and because the probation

12

officer offered an alternative or a set of alternatives to Mr.

13

Cox that the law of Vermont doesn't even find to be

14

permissible, he made an unfree, if you will, or a coerced

15

choice when he went ahead and spoke.

16

QUESTION:

Well, the Vermont Supreme Court, though,

17

went to the Fifth Amendment.

MR. HINTON:

From the record, we only know that since

counsel claimed that she didn't get an adequate opportunity to

13

advise Mr. Cox and unlike what counsel for the State of Vermont

represented, we can't assume from this record that there was

some reasonable period of time before she showed up for the

MR. HINTON:

I don't know

where he is. I had the same investigator try to find him.

He's gone from Vermont.

QUESTION:

Would it be good sense for him to come

back to Vermont after he served his sentence?
MR. HINTON:

6

I think not.

I think the possibilities

suggested by the state that he could get a deferred sentence is

8

so unlikely that he would be, I think, foolish to come back.

QUESTION:

If he calls you up and says can I come

back, I take it you would tell him, if you can make a living

11

somewhere else, please do?
MR. HINTON:

12

I think that's probably what both I

13

would tell him and probably the prosecuting authorities would

14

be happy with.

15

QUESTION:

Then, why did you press his case in the

16

Supreme Court of Vermont once he had served his sentence?

gather he had served his sentence before that case was argued.

It's

be very much in his interests to get his first conviction

MR. HINTON:

Yes, it would be in his interests, but I

think the likelihood of getting a deferred sentence, because

5

he's got a prior record of criminal offenses that existed in

6

other states way before these three simple assaults.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Hinton, let me ask you a variation of

8

these questions.

Supposing he were to call you up and say I've

9

got lots of money now, so I don't have to have public counsel,

10

how much would it be worth to me to hire a lawyer to defend

11

this judgment, what would you tell him?

12

How much interest does he have in the outcome of this case?

13

MR. HINTON:

14

QUESTION:

Nickel, dime, quarter.

Very little.
He doesn't have any, does he?

There's no

15

way in the world he'd go back in and say I want to get re­

16

sentenced, is there?

for him, would he?

23

MR. HINTON:

24

The reason why I think independent of the Fifth

25

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Amendment argument, which I think I've presented on the
42

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

assumption that there is no necessary federal right to counsel

2

at this stage, is that there's a state right to counsel and

3

that was burdened by the choices offered.

4

But I also think independent of that, this Court

5

should decide that where there's a guilty pleading or nolo

6

pleading defendant or in any case where there's a conviction

7

and there's no sentence that for the pre-sentence investigation

8

process should be subject to the Sixth Amendment only in this

9

respect, and that is in the respect that when the defendant is

10

interviewed, that defendant, just like in post-indictment line­

11

up, he's confronted with agents of the state who can do things,

12

just like in a post-indictment interrogation, he's confronted

13

with agents of the state in which he needs to make those fine

14

distinctions about what may or may not incriminate him, in the

15

same way that what happens at a line-up or what happens at a

16

post-indictment and pre-trial interrogation can seal the fate

17

of the defendant making the trial a formality, the sentencing

18

hearing in the same way can become a walk-through, if the

19

defendant has essentially operated without counsel during his

20

interview with the probation officer.

21

I think the Court could very well find and given the

22

analogy, I think, to the other processes by which the Court has

23

determined that critical confrontations outside of court

24

between a defendant and the government are — those kinds of

25

things which Sixth Amendment protects, was designed to protect,
43

Heritage Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

I think the Court can support the decision of the Vermont

2

Supreme Court strictly on the basis of the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

3

Again, as

matter of practice,

is it

4

common in a situation like this for a defendant not to

5

participate in the interview with the probation officer?
MR. HINTON:

6

If the defendant has got a very terrible

7

record and is very unlikely to do anything more than make it

8

worse,

9

for.

I think non-participation would be what would be called

QUESTION:

10

And that's the advice that the public

11

defender of Chittenden County would give to somebody like that,

12

I take it?

13

criminal jurisprudence that a certain number of defendants are

14

not going to participate in these interviews.

So, it's a fairly recognized practice in Vermont

15

Is that what you're saying?

16

MR. HINTON:

17

sure what the percentages are.

18

to participate even if they're advised to participate, but —

19

QUESTION:

Some — I think that's true.

I'm not

I think some maybe will refuse

Do you think that there's still — do you

20

think we have jurisdiction to decide this case?

21

there's still a case for controversy between you and the state?

22

Is the case moot?

23
24
25

MR. HINTON:

As a practical matter,

Do you think

I don't think

there is.
QUESTION:

As a technical matter, is this moot or
44

MR. HINTON:

3

As a technical, theoretical matter, it

might be.
QUESTION:

4

If we just dismiss it as moot, then the

5

order on the state still stands.

6

that they still have to contend with that order.

MR. HINTON:

Well, worry about it now.

They've got an

So, you don't think — technically, is it moot or not?
MR. HINTON:

I think that only in the most technical

15

way is it not moot.

16

QUESTION:

Well, mootness is technical in itself.

17

QUESTION:

But is it correct that if he doesn't come

18

back, the state doesn't have to do anything? They won't be in

19

contempt of any order.

20

21
22
23

MR. HINTON:

They don't have to grant him a re­

sentencing unless he seeks it and —
QUESTION:

Would you object to if the state said —

went back and asked to be relieved from that order?

24

MR. HINTON:

25

QUESTION:

On the grounds of mootness?
Well, just on the ground that you say
45

there's nothing to the case.

is outstanding or not?

Why do you care whether the order

I only care if he comes back.
I guess you care enough then.
Well, perhaps —

anything under the order.

MR. HINTON:

If he asked for your advice, you'd

Right.
But, then, he wouldn't ask for anything,

12

but if he came back, the police would — the state would pick

13

him up, pick him up and re-sentence him pursuant to this order.

MR. HINTON:

I don't know if they would force a re­

15

that would be the case.
