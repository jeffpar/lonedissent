ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR.

THORNBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the honorable Court, North Carolina is here today

12

because of the lower courts' interpretations of your

13

decisions in the Munson and Schaumburg.

14

interpretations effectively eliminate the state's police

15

power to regulate the for profit commercial operator who

16

solicits funds for charities.

17

Now,

The lower courts'

Schaumberg and Munson held that a state's

18

limitations on the amount a charity could spend for

19

fundraising activities violated the charity's First Amendment

20

rights to free speech.

21

limitation on the amount a charity may spend to get its

22

messaqe out.

and to protect the charities because of the fundraising

The North Carolina approach requlates two

2

troublesome economic practices of the commercial fundraiser

3

dealing with reasonableness of fees and also point of

4

solicitation disclosure, and eliminates a privilege that

5

was previously given to the commercial fundraiser to operate

6

before being fully licensed.

7

Mow, the lower court overlooked the distinction

8

between the publicly supported charity and the commercial

9

fundraiser.

North Carolina in this statutory scheme seeks

10

only to regulate the professional fundraiser under its

11

police power.

12

number of years in the state of North Caroline we have

13

mirrored the national practice and problems T7ith the

14

commercial fundraiser as shown by the uncontested record in

15

the case, the difficulties, and the most frequent complaints

16

that were experienced in North Carolina with the fundraisers

17

related to high fees and costs which caused low returns to

18

the charities, a lack of disclosure of fees at the time of

19

solicitation, and frequently the unauthorized use of the

20

charities' names at the time solicitations were being

21

made.

22

Now, by way of factual background, for a

Now, to assess the factual basis for these

23

fee concerns, I had my staff do an analysis of the reports

24

of five of the largest fundraising groups in North Carolina

25

for the period from 19 80 to 1984, and this showed, this
Acme Reporting Company
(202)

628 4888

4

1

analysis showed that charities were receiving on the average

2

less than 20 percent of the total funds that were collected

3

from this source, in other words, 80 percent was regularly

4

going another direction.
The other complaints that I mentioned were verified

5
6

through Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce and

7

charities and individuals.
Now, an examination of the law revealed that

8

9

for the State of North Carolina there was no definition of

10

fundraising fees on the books.

11

the commercial fundraiser charge reasonable fees, and there

12

was no requirement for point of disclosure of factual fee

13

data at the time of solicitation, and further it was dis­

14

covered in the law that the commercial operator was allowed

15

the Drivileqe of beginning the solicitation process without

16

beinq fully licensed to do so or before the license was

17

obtained.

18

There was no requirement that

Now, when these deficiencies were brought to the

19

attention of the North Carolina General Assembly, the

20

legislature enacted the statutes that are before you today

21

in this case, and we contend that the purpose of the statutes

22

is set out in the statute,to protect the general public and

23

to protect the charities, and also is in keeping with what

24

Professor Karsch in his Harvard Law Review looks to as saying

25

that we should conserve and use the greatest portion of the

that is your objective, to make sure that as much money that

is collected goes to the charitable purposes, it seems to me

8

that a much more efficient way than requiring the fundraiser

9

agent to say what percentage of his collected funds went to

10

the charity, not in this campaicrn but in prior campaigns, a

11

much more effective way would be to require the charity

12

itself, whether it operates directly or through an agent,

13

to tell the prospective donor how much of the donor's money

14

is going to go directly to the intended recipients.

15

For example, requiring the Red Cross to say that X

percent of the money you give us is expended on salaries of

our officers and employees, and X percent goes to the donees

MR. THORNBURG:

Your Honor, we require that of the

21

charities, although they are not -- and through these fund­

22

raisers they are not involved, of course, in soliciting the

23

funds, and what we are trying to say is that this fundraiser

24

should make a disclosure to the prospective donor precisely

25

what percent of the money is going to the charity so that the

You require the charities in North

MR. THORNBURG:

We require, Your Honor, that they

8

file it with the regulator and it is available on request.

9

The same is true of the — information is true of the

10

11

fundraiser.
QUESTION:

These people have no objection to that,

12

to filing it and having it available on request, as I under­

13

stand what they are saying here.

14

MR. THORNBURG:

I think that is correct, but they

15

do object to making the disclosure at the time of

16

solicitation.

QUESTION:

But you don't require the charities

themselves to make that much more -- much more pertinent
disclosure.
MR. THORNBURG:

If the charities themselves are

21

involved in the solicitation, that is correct, vour Honor,

22

but there is a substantial difference between the commercial

23
24
25

operator and the charity itself which of course is the end
user of the funds, and taking the property or the funds and
using it for the purpose that has been established and its

QUESTION:

Well, I guess there are two cuts being

taken.

4

salaries and expenses before giving direct relief, and if

5

they rely on a profesional fundraiser, the professional

6

fundraiser takes a cut for himself before giving anything

7

to charity for which another cut is taken.

The charity itself takes a cut out of it to pay

8

MR. THORNBURG:

9

QUESTION:

10

Exactly, Your Honor.

Your law that we are looking at relates

to the first cut, that taken by the professional fundraiser.
MR. THORNBURG:

11

Exactly, and what we are hoping

12

is that this point of solicitation disclosure would bring

13

some interest to bear for the prospective donor on just what

14

is happening to the money, at least in the beginning.

15

QUESTION:

I suppose we look at it under the

16

reasonable time, place, and manner sort of analysis?

17

that what we do?

18

MR. THORNBURG:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that's

correct.

MR. THORNBURG:

Well, it could bring on a

22

made.

be retained and not given to the charity?
MR. THORNBURG:

We think that the minimum amount

of information that should be made available would include
this number as to what percentage had previously been
returned to the charity so that the perceptive donor would
understand how much of their money is actually goinq to a
charitable purpose.
QUESTION:

But what was done before wouldn't tell

you what is going to happen this time, would it?
MR. THORNBURG:

11

Well, most of the time you rely on

past experience to suggest what the future may be, Your Honor.

10

no trouble with the charities and the difficulty, the

11

problem had come from the fundraiser, and that is what

12

triggered the enactment of this legislation.

13

What the legislation did was define what a

14

fundraising fee was, prohibited unreasonable fees, established

15

a procedure to allow inquiry into these fees that were being

16

charged, authorize the regulator to set a reasonable fee after

17

a full hearing if the fee charged was found to be unreasonable

18

mandated the factual point of disclosure or point of

19

solicitation disclosure, and prohibited commercial operations

20

until the licensure was complete.

21

Now, the definition was added to the statute as to

22

what a fundraising fee was, and unreasonable fundraising

23

fees were made unlawful.

24

added to assist the factfinder in determination of the

reasonableness of a particular fee at issue, and to meet the

are finally told or they get the message that this much of

2

the money is going into some place other than the charity,

then it is going to make it more and more difficult to raise

money in this or any other fashion, because the amount of

5

money there is limited, of course, while the number of

charities and the number of reguests continues to arow.

QUESTION:

Doesn't this approach, though, make

it awfully tough on the charities who rely on expensive

There were certain other

provisions of the North Carolina registration requirements

for professional representatives that were not challenged,

that are still on the books, and that are still being

15

complied with by professional representatives.

QUESTION:

What about the licensing provisions?

17

MR. COPILEVITZ:

There is still a.license beinc

18

issued and granted because there are requirements to file

amended an existinq provision that required the providing

interest to do that.

In other words, you don't think that

MR. COPILEVITZ:

That's

I think in that circumstance

you probably could, but I think that in this circumstance

where we are dealing with the burden on free speech there

11

are other considerations at hand.

Do you think the state could put a

maximum price on how much a political organization can

QUESTION:

No, sir, I do not.

So I guess what we are talking about

18

on your view of it is whether this is closer to a political

type speech than it is to whatever normal theater speech

20

would be, on your view.

21

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well, this Court has held twice

in this decade that this -- the activity of charitable

is the disclosure section.

Could we return for just a

minute to the limitation on fees that I thouaht we were

Section 10(d) the fundraiser can charge as much as 100

unconstitutional, would it?

3

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well,

if they are staying out

4

of North Carolina because the statutory scheme creates a

5

prior restraint, it is the charities that are complaininq.

6

It is the charities that are the plaintiffs in the case at

7

bar.

QUESTION:

Well, if it's a prior restraint,

fine.

But the mere fact that its effect is to keep people out --

10

keep fundraisers out of North Carolina, that in and of

11

itself doesn't prove anything.

12

professional fundraisers out of North Carolina.
MR. COPILEVITZ:

13

A lot of thinqs can keep

But we are talking about them as

a class of — a medium for a certain group, a certain size

of charitable organizations, and this certain ciroup or class

16

of charitable organizations is being joined by the larger

17

and the most substantial charitable organizations in this

country.

QUESTION:

Probably a lot of bucket shop operators

requiring securities disclosure.

23

unconstitutional because the bucket shop operators

24

complained.

25

They wouldn't work in

But we never held those statutes

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well, probably the corporations that --

the same contention, that they were complaining, they didn't

7

MR. COPILEVITZ:

could mae

Well, I would take exception with

8

the example and illustrate it perhaps by the Zauderer case,

9

which the state has relied on a great deal, that says that

10

the advertising of a lawyer can be regulated as to his

11

client, as to potential clients.

12

The State of North Carolina again already has a

13

statute in place that makes a professional representative

advise a charity in advance if his contract is going to

15

exceed more than 50 percent.

MR. COPILEVITZ:

I assume we can rule aqainst you and

I don't think that is possible.

I think that one is a conduit of free speech.

8

QUESTION:

Try me.

9

(General laughter.)

10

MR. COPILEVITZ:

I think I will decline.

11

The plaintiffs in this case by affidavit have

12

expressed very real and legitimate concerns.

Their

13

assertions remain unrefuted. Unlike the larger, more

14

substantial groups, these groups cannot rely on media

15

advertising, door-to-door or telephone solicitation without

16

the help of professional representatives and be financially

17

succesful.

18

they lack the manpower.

They lack name recognition, they lack expertise,

These challenged provisions make the availability

19
20

of those services to them most unlikely and in our view

21

impossible.
No one seeks to avoid the right of a prospective

22

donor to inquire.

No one ask that misreprsentation be

allowed.

protestations to the contrary, the concept of disclosure

4

case and the matters that this Court was confronted with

5

in both the Maryland statute in Munson and the Villaqe of

6

Schaumburq ordinance in Schaumburq was that this disclosure

7

goes to content of speech.

8

about in Schaumburg and Munson was a disclosure of public

9

record.

The main distinction between this

The disclosure that was talked

10

There are three kinds of disclosure.

There is

11

government-compelled disclosure, which is the filing of

12

registrations, the obtaining of licenses, the bonds, the

13

financial report.

14

North Carolina as a part of these amended statutes -- or,

15

excuse me, prior to these amended statutes, still on the

16

books and unchallenged, is a state statute that makes it a

17

criminal offense not to disclose upon request by a citizen

18

of North Carolina in writing, giving a full financial

19

report.

There is the disclosure upon request,

20

That remains on the books.

21

The third type of disclosure is a compelled

22

disclosure to every prospective donor.

The North Carolina

23

legislation had three separate parts.

24

found that it was not an undue burden to require the

25

disclosure of the name, to require the disclosure of the

They did find that it was an undue burden to disclose the

track record of the professional for the preceding 12

months, calling it irrelevant.

raised the question rhetorically that if the interest --

Amendment how did it infringe First Amendment rights?

8

Anything that was irrelevant burdens First Amendment riqhts?

9

MR. COPILEVITZ: What burdens the First Amendment

10

rights is that when you are dealing with face to face

11

solicitation, or telephone solicitation, as this Court

12

said in Members of the City Council of Los Angeles versus

13

Benson, that face to face solicitation and telephone is

14

entitled to extra consideration because of the nature of

15

the activity.

16

It is the most accessible to the smaller and

18

QUESTION:

So?

19

MR. COPILEVITZ:

It is the most delicate

So?

So?

So that when the state requires

20

me that in addition to being able and before I can aive

21

the message of those I represent I have to tell you my name,

22

the name of the company I work for, their address, and what

23

that company's track record is for the preceding 12 months,

24

by the time that I get to talk to you about the message of

25

the National Federation of the Blind and their interest in

If we allow the

The other, contrary to the fact assumption of this
particular type of statute, is that summary financial

There are other states, like New York, that

require a written disclosure on all materials that go out

in the mail that says you may obtain additional financial

people, you can find out more if you want, and it allows

the charity to go into the marketplace of ideas and support

inaccurate.

QUESTION:

May I ask if your argument applies

equally to telephone -- I know in the strongest context

harmful, because you can add a further explanation in the

MR. COPILEVITZ:

I don't believe that written

19

disclosure is harmful at all.

QUESTION:

22

Why is that so

I believe that --

In other words, this would be all right

if applied merely to written solicitations?

But what it does is, it aives

the charity a chance to explain ficrures and amplify.

11

QUESTION:

I see.

12

MR. COPILEVITZ:

It gives them the context of

13

allowing you to understand what it's all about, and that

14

form the charity needs because worthy charities have hiqh

15

costs, and if they have to start by telling you that they

16

have high costs, and that professionals are involved, and all

17

these other things, they are never going to receive your

18

support.

19

QUESTION:

Counsel, do you have anv answer to

20

the statement made by the Attorney General that the study

21

shows practically all of the charities only get 20 percent?

22

MR. COPILEVITZ:

Well, I think what the Attorney

23

General said is that they picked out five particular

24

professional fundraisers and as to those five the studies

25

showed 20 percent.

14

MR. COPILEVITZ:

I would suggest to you that the

15

records also show from Mr. Edgerton's deposition that there's

16

many times the number of five professional fundraising

17

representatives that are licensed to work in the State of

18

North Carolina, and that North Carolina would be better

served to enforce its existing statutes and require the

disclosure of professional fundraisers to the charities as

to what kind of track record they have.
