CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Farr, you may proceed

whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FARR:

6
7
8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Our disagreement with the Fifth Circuit decision in
this case rests upon two basic grounds.

First, we think that

10

final judgments should not be set aside because of after the

11

fact recusal motions, unless there is a showing of actual

12

judicial impropriety.

13

Second, we think that such relief is particularly

14

inappropriate when at the time of judgment that the district

15

judge did not even know of possible grounds for recusal.

16

Because a judge without knowledge cannot possibly favor one

17

side or the other, it is in fact is more unfair in this case to

18

throw out the judgment than it is to give it effect.

19

Now I would like to just spend a few minutes at the

20

outset on the facts of the case.

The findings made by a

21

separate district judge showed that at the time that he

22

rendered his judgment and at the relevant time that the case

23

was before him, that Judge Collins had no recollection of and

24

no knowledge of any discussions between Petitioner and Loyola

25

University regarding the possible purchase of some Loyola land.

3

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

The judge found that there were numerous individuals

1

2

who had been discussing the possible purchase with Loyola, and

3

that Judge Collins did not have any recollection that

4

Petitioner was among them.
Now the Court will recall that this case did not

5

6

involve Loyola University in any way.

7

to the case.

8

interest was never mentioned in the case.

9

discussion of land in the opinion, but that is completely

10

Loyola was not a party

Its land was never mentioned in the case, and its
There was some

different land that has nothing to do with Loyola University.
Judge Collins was said to have known at an earlier

11
12

time, because he was present at some board meetings where the

13

matter was discussed and after his judgment, but the specific

14

finding is that at the time of his judgment that he did not

15

know.

16

Now I should take this opportunity to correct a

17

statement that I did make at the first argument, which is that

18

he did not have earlier knowledge either.

19

that he had had earlier knowledge, but said that at the time

20

that the case was before him that he did not have any knowledge

21

of these discussions.

22
23

QUESTION:

The Court did find

Was the finding that he did not know or

that he did not remember?

24

MR. FARR:

I am sorry.

25

QUESTION:

Was the finding that he did not know or

4

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

that he did not remember?
MR. FARR:

2

Well, I think both.

I think that the

3

specific finding actually is stated in terms of knowledge.

4

I think that it is implicit in that that he would not have

5

remembered any earlier information that he might have had by

6

virtue of having attended the board meetings.

7

But

Now the Fifth Circuit did not reverse its finding.

8

In fact, it reaffirmed that Judge Collins did not know at the

9

time of his judgment about the discussions.

What it held was

10

simply that the judgment had to be set aside, because in effect

11

he should have known.

12

Now in discussing this decision, I would like to

13

begin with what I think is an obvious but important point.

14

That the question here is not simply one of getting another

15

judge at the beginning of the case, which is what Section 455

16

is basically aimed at.

17

The question here is one of setting aside a final

18

judgment based on a motion that was made after the judgment was

19

entered.

20

claims raised for the first time after judgment.

21

course, plain error rules on appeal and things like that.

22

for Rule 60(b)(6), which is the rule under which this

23

particular motion has been made, usually the Court has required

24

a showing of exceptional circumstances before it would find a

25

basis for a judgment being set aside.

Now usually, this Court has set a high threshold for

2

Can you refresh my recollection, what was the date on
which this judgment was entered?
MR. FARR:

6

QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

The date that the Court is using is the

24th of March, perhaps the 25th, but I think the 24th.
QUESTION:

11
12

And what was the date when he found out

about the possible appearance of impropriety arising?

9
10

The judge signed the judgment on the 12th

of March, and the judgment was entered formally on the 16th.

If you

draw the line at when the judgment was entered.

3
4

Mr. Farr, can I interrupt you.

And my question is what in your view was

the Trial Judge's duty under the statute at that point in time?

13

MR. FARR:

I do not think that the judge in the case

14

after the judgment essentially had been entered had any

15

specific duty under the statute.

16

would have been better practice, since it was so close to the

17

time of judgment, if he had informed the parties, but it would

18

not make any difference to our position in this case even if he

19

had.
QUESTION:

20

I think, frankly, that it

And what would you say if a motion had

21

been made on say the 26th or 27th of March, whatever the dates

22

were?

23
24
25

MR. FARR:

We would take exactly the same position,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

That it was too late?

6

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

MR. FARR:

1

That is right.

I mean what we are talking

2

about here is essentially a situation where he enters a

3

judgment and he decides a case, and he has no reason to favor

4

one party or the other.

5

that it would have been better practice had he made that clear

6

eight days later, it would not have made any difference to the

7

decision.
QUESTION:

9

three of four days earlier.

I guess that there were just a

10

couple of days before he got those letters.

11

have been a critical difference too, I guess.
MR. FARR:

12

And that would

Your Honor, I am not sure that it would

13

have.

I guess that it depends whether we are talking a couple

14

of days meaning before he had entered judgment.

15

that case, because the case would have still have been before

16

him, that he would have not entered a judgment.

17

at that point that he might well have had a duty to step aside

18

and let another judge take over at that point.
QUESTION:

20

I think in

I think that

knowledge, would he not?

21

MR. FARR:

That is right.

That would be my

22

understanding of the statute.

23

used the phrase "might well" is that there is the unusual

24

circumstance in this case that he did announce his ruling from

25

the bench.

The only reason in fact that I

QUESTION:

Well, then he had no authority on the

60(b) motion, did he, or the new trial motion?
MR. FARR:

What happened in fact when the

4

Rule 60(b) motion was filed and it was filed approximately a

5

year and a half after the time that we are talking about now,

6

he sought to reassign it to another judge for decision.

7

However, they sent it back to him.

10

QUESTION:

At that time, he was no

But as of March 24th, he was mandatorily

disqualified from this case under any view, was he not?

11

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

12

QUESTION:

And he had no authority to make any

13

further rulings in the case.

14

MR. FARR:

As long as he was a trustee of Loyola

15

University, that is correct.

16

made, the Rule 60(b) motion, in fact he was no longer a trustee

17

of Loyola University.

18

filed the first time at that point, then he might well not have

19

had an obligation to recuse himself.

20

QUESTION:

At the time that the motion was

So for example, if the case had been

Suppose that he did not remember the fact

21

that his wife owned this property.

Let us just assume that his

22

wife owned the adjoining property.

And as a result of his

23

judgment, his wife is greatly enriched.

24

Is that grounds for recusal, mandatory recusal?

25

MR. FARR:

If there was a finding that he did not

8

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

know about his wife's interest, Your Honor, I do not think that

2

there would be grounds for recusal.

3

QUESTION:

The same case?

4

MR. FARR:

The same case.

The specific statutory-

5

provision that we would be dealing with in terms of the wife's

6

interest in Section (b)(4), which specifically requires that he

7

know of the interest before he is disqualified.
Now the question then would be if he did not in fact

8
9

know, if he sat in perfect good faith in ignorance of this

10

interest that his wife had, and that was part of the factual

11

findings of the case, would that then have been a disqualifying

12

interest.

13
14

I think not.
QUESTION:

Suppose that you add the fact that he was

negligent in not knowing, is there any difference?

15

MR. FARR:

No.

I think that the point that we are

16

making here is that the remedy of throwing out a final judgment

17

for something which is merely negligence is too strong a

18

remedy.

19

that that Congress intended that at any time that a judge

20

inadvertently did not know about something that could be

21

grounds for recusal if he had known about it, that the

22

judgments automatically ought to be thrown out.

23

That there is no indication that in a situation like

QUESTION:

Well, does the court below have discretion

24

to set aside the judgment; did the Fifth Circuit say that this

25

was automatic, that it had no choice?

Heritage

(202) 628-4888

MR. FARR:

1

Well, it accepted the finding, and then

2

said that it found that there was an appearance of impropriety.

3

Our position certainly is that we do not see how there is an

4

appearance of impropriety, if a judge is sitting without

5

knowledge of a possible disqualifying interest.

6

circumstances, what possible ground would he have to favor one

7

side or the other.
In that particular case, there is not the kind of

Under those

temptation, which in the words that the Court has used, which

10

would lead him to hold the balance other than straight and

11

true.

It is only if he has knowledge.

13
14

QUESTION:

Again the same argument if he is

That is correct, that is correct.

negligent?
And we

15

think that Congress in fact specifically framed Subsection (b)

16

in terms of knowledge for just that reason.

17

that as long as you can show that a judge should have known of

18

something, just to take the negligence standard.

Because if you say

QUESTION:

You are not ignoring appearances, are you?

Your Honor, I am not ignoring appearances.

What I am saying is that here you have a specific finding that

And I think that that is a very important

24

QUESTION:

Everybody but him.

25

MR. FARR:

He understood that he was a trustee.

1

he did not know that there was any interest in the case before.
QUESTION:

2
3

I know, but it seems to me that

appearances are there.
MR. FARR:

4

Well, Your Honor, what I am submitting

5

here is that when you are talking about a situation where he in

6

fact did not have knowledge, you can only create the appearance

7

essentially by doubting the fact that he did not have

8

knowledge.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Farr, is that not the very point of

10

the appearance of impropriety, that the public really does not

11

know exactly what the judge's state of mind was, or whether he

12

remembered, or deliberately forgot or what.

13

concept is designed to take care of in part of public

14

perceptions of act when you do not in fact until months later

15

have a finding of fact that he did not actually know.

16

MR. FARR:

And the appearance

That is the normal intent of it.

in fact to transfer the case to another judge.
And I think that the question here is a somewhat more

2
3

difficult one, which is in a situation where he did not know,

4

would we just apply the same rule.
QUESTION:

5

Would you say that 455(a), which I think

6

is the relevant provision here, can never be violated if the

7

judge is not aware of a disqualifying fact.

8

They have portfolios of stock, and they forget that they own a

9

hundred shares of some stock, but the newspapers check this up.

Judges do this.

Would you say that there was no violation of that

10

U

section, if the judge has honestly forgot about it, if there

12

was no appearance of impropriety?

13

MR. FARR:

I would say so in the example that you

14

have given me, Justice Stevens.

15

of an example in which I think if a judge honestly did not know

16

of any reason to be partial, that that would legitimately

17

create an appearance of partiality.

QUESTION:

I have not been able to think

think that that would create an appearance of impropriety.

Do you not

The only reason that I thought that you could argue

12

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that there was not one here is that the impropriety did not at

2

all consist about the fact, that is was very hidden, even the

3

other side did not realize that this land or that this company

4

had a bid in on land, and if the company went under that the

5

land would not be bought by that company, and that the land

6

belonged to Loyola.I can understand that that is no appearance

7

of impropriety, because the public at large would not know

8

that.

9
10
11

But the other example that I just gave you, would
that not be an appearance of impropriety?
MR. FARR:

But of course, in that case,

12

Justice Scalia, I cannot imagine that there would be a

13

determination that he did not about it.

14

give you a technical answer.

21

QUESTION:

To begin with, just to

It is my hypothetical.

I mean there is a

determination that he did not know about it.
MR. FARR:

And that finding is made on the basis of a

record as accepted by the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Then there is no appearance of

impropriety?
MR. FARR:

I think that in a situation where he does

22

not know about the particular grounds to give rise to recusal

23

that the appearance can only be achieved essentially by not

24

accepting the finding.

1

looking at it say here is a particular finding that a judge has

2

made and I personally do not accept it, if you follow that

3

course with Section 455(a) or even 455(b), you are going to

4

open up all sorts of situations where the findings are

5

controlling.
QUESTION:

6

Yes. But under your view, as I understand

7

you, you really will not know whether there was an appearance

8

of impropriety until you have had a finding of fact on the

9

judge's state of knowledge.
MR. FARR:

10

Well, Justice Stevens, I think that that

11

occurs in lots of cases, whether it is something that the judge

12

knew, or whether it is something that the judge did, or

13

something that the judge said.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I am not disagreeing with you that

15

that is not true, but that is a little different from one's

16

normal concept of what an appearance of impropriety is.

seems to me that the appearance either exists or it does not

terms of reasonable suspicion.

24

may be suspicious, even after a judge has said that there is no

25

basis here for believing that this judge did anything wrong.

Heritage

Now I suppose that the public

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

The public looks at it and says, gee, if we had been the judge,

2

we think that something looks worse than that, we are troubled

3

about that.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, how does Subsection (c) enter

5

into this.

It says that the judge should inform himself about

6

his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a

7

reasonable effort, and so forth.

8

Does that enter into the picture at all?

9

MR. FARR:

I do not think that it enters into this

10

picture, Justice O'Connor, and let me try to explain why.

11

the first argument, I indicated why I thought that that

12

particular section did not really apply here.

13

Section (b)(4) says knows, not should know.

14

nothing in (c) about a conclusive presumption.

15

At

Because
And there is

But I would like to supplement that answer by

16

pointing to the particular language of Subsection (c).

17

I think that under any reading of Subsection (c) that the

18

knowledge that we are talking about here is not the kind of

19

knowledge that he would be conclusively presumed to know under

20

(c), even if it does have the conclusive presumption.

21

Because

What Judge Collins is said not to have known in this

22

case is the names of possible purchasers of land from Loyola

23

University.

24

under (c) or what he is required to inform himself about are

25

fiduciary financial interests.

And if you look at what he is required to know

Heritage

And financial interests are

15
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

defined in terms of ownership of a legal or an equitable

2

interest.
QUESTION:

3

Well, then what about the hypothetical

4

that you were asked about the spouse owning shares of stock, I

5

mean he deals with a case involving that company, do you not

6

think that (c) suggests that he should know that his wife owns

7

the stock?

8
9

MR. FARR:

Let me say that (c), of course, in the

hypothetical of his wife, that there is a reasonable efforts

10

clause under (c), not a specific knowledge clause.

11

legislative history gives an example which Justice Traynor gave

12

of the difficulty of asking one's spouse about his or her

13

investments, and indicates that they particularly had a lower

14

threshold in that situation.

15

The

But anyway to answer your question, Justice O'Connor,

16

I think that there might be a possible reading under (c) which

17

says that the way that we are going to enforce the provisions

18

of Subsection (c) is to assume that a judge knows at least

19

about what he is required to inform himself about, and perhaps

20

what he is supposed to make reasonable efforts about.

21

But even if that were so, that still would not mean

22

that he would have to know not just what he owned, what his

23

wife owned, what any private trust that he served as a trustee

24

owned or any university, but also anybody who might buy that.

25

QUESTION:

But in the case of other than this one

16

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

628-4888

1

then, do you concede that (c) affects (a) in the sense at least

2

to the extent that the judge is supposed to inform himself

3

about his own personal interests?
MR. FARR:

4

I guess that I think that it is possible,

Justice O'Connor.

I do not believe that I need to win those

6

cases, so I think that the easy thing to do would be just to

say yes.

1

inquire as a fiduciary into all of the interests of Loyola,

2

just to make sure that this does not happen?
MR. FARR:

3

Well, what I would like to point out here

4

is that even if the judge had carried out that duty to its

5

fullest degree, at least that I think is contemplated by (c),

6

had learned everything that Loyola owned, that still would not

7

have been enough to put him on notice necessarily about the

8

case that was in front of him.

9

I mean obviously if Loyola University had been a

10

party or its land had been mentioned in the case, then you

11

could say, well, he is supposed to know that they owned the

12

land, and then he should recognize when it was mentioned.
But what we are talking about here is a series of

13
14

board meetings.

15

board meetings over a period of several years, in which the

16

name of the petitioner and the corporation that he owns are

17

mentioned on a couple of occasions.

MR. FARR:

Well, except that was one of numerous

21

things that they were talking about doing with this particular

22

piece of land.

23

put yourself in the position that a trustee is in in these

24

board meetings, where you are talking about numerous items that

25

come up, for example.

I think that to some extent that you have to

2

things that are discussed at a meeting.

3

And even then, the idea of using this as a hospital

4

was one idea.

The idea of using it as a shopping center was

5

another idea.

There is a part in the minutes about somebody

6

wanting to use it for parking.

7

QUESTION:

8

That was what I was going to mention.

There were minutes of all of these meetings.

9

MR. FARR:

There were minutes.

10

QUESTION:

Which he was supposed to have read.

11

MR. FARR:

He said that what he did is that he

12

13
14
15

scanned the minutes.
QUESTION:

Anybody in the public assumes that a

trustee reads the minutes.
MR. FARR:

He said that he scans the minutes of the

16

meeting, but that he took no particular interest in these

17

financial dealings.

18

important to note --

19

20
21

QUESTION:

And one of the things that I think is

How can you convince the public of that,

that a judge does not understand what he is reading?
MR. FARR:

Well, the public has to understand the

22

position that a judge is in, particularly as a fiduciary of an

23

institution like a university.

24

fact prohibits a judge from taking an active interest in the

25

financial affairs of Loyola University.

The Code of Judicial Ethics in

He is not allowed to

3

a public institution, but he cannot take an active role in the

QUESTION:

Well, did he in this case make his

position clear?
MR. FARR:

He can a trustee for certain kinds of

finances.

He did not take an active role in Loyola's

In fact, that is precisely what he said.
QUESTION:

Did he make that clear to the public, did

he make that clear to the public or anybody else?
MR. FARR:

He testified under oath to that effect;

yes, he did.

13

QUESTION:

He made it clear to whom?

14

MR. FARR:

When a Rule 60 motion was filed a year and

15
16

17
18
19
20
21
22

a half afterwards.
QUESTION:

That is not what I am talking about.

You

said that under the law that he has to do this.
But did he do that, did he make it clear that he was
not interested in the fiduciary doings of that place, did he?
MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I am not sure that I

understand your question quite honestly.
QUESTION:

Did he say that I pursuant to the laws of

23

the State of California am not allowed to participate in the

24

fiduciary business of this corporation?

25

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I do not know that he did

20

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

that.

But I do know that he did not serve on the real estate

2

committee, that he did not serve on the investment committee,

3

that he did not serve on the executive committee.

4

QUESTION:

Did he disqualify himself from every vote

5

on every financial transaction that came before the board of

6

trustees?

7

MR. FARR:

The Code of Ethics allows you to vote as a

8

general trustee on financial matters.

What it does not allow

9

you to do, however, is to actually participate in making the

10

financial decisions.

11

that in a sense that we are looking to impose.

12

QUESTION:

And I think that what is happening is

Do you think that it is appropriate for a

13

judge to vote on a financial matter which is also appearing

14

before his court?

15

MR. FARR:

Do I think that it is appropriate?

16

QUESTION:

Do you think that it is appropriate for a

17

judge to vote on a financial matter and financial transaction

18

that is being reviewed in his court?

19

MR. FARR:

No, I do not.

I think that if he knows

20

that there is a financial matter either at the board meeting or

21

in his court, that he should not vote on it if it is in his

22

court, or that he should recuse himself if the matter is before

23

him in his courtroom.

24

are talking about knowledge.

25

here is a situation where Judge Collins could not reasonably

But those are cases, of course, where we

have had any reason to favor one party or another.

2

question really then is is it appropriate --

And the

3

QUESTION:

Was that finding made by the lower court?

4

MR. FARR:

Pardon me.

5

QUESTION:

Was that finding made by the lower court?

6

MR. FARR:

Not that specific finding.

But the

7

finding that he had no knowledge, it seems to me, that it

8

follows naturally from that that if you do not know about any

9

reason to be partial, that there is no reason that you would

10

favor one party over the other.

And the court below accepted

11

his testimony to the effect that he did not know at the time

12

that he sat on the case.
Now I would just like to make one brief point, and

13

14

then save the remainder of my time, if I may.

The type of

15

thing that we are talking about, the issue of allegations about

16

a judge and what is determined, and then what the public

17

believes, does come up in several different kinds of cases.
And in response to Justice Stevens' question, I

18
19

wanted to say that there are cases, for example, where there is

20

an allegation made that a judge made an out of court statement

21

to a third party which indicates some sort of bias or

22

prejudice.

23

And in each of those cases, there is then a question

24

as to whether in fact the judge made the statement.

25

have been fact findings.

There is a case in the Seventh

22

Heritage

And there

Circuit, Balastrue; the Ninth Circuit, Conford; and the Fifth

2

Circuit, Brown, which are examples of this.
Sometimes the fact finding is not favorable to the

3
4

judge.

5

sometimes it is.

6

what he said, that is then used as the basis for application of

7

the statutory provision.

8

9

That was the situation in the Brown case.

And

But it is that finding, whether he said it or

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Farr, the facts that give

rise to the violation of 455(a), if there was a violation of

10

455(a), would exist before the finding occurred.

11

ones that you described depend on whether the statement was

12

made, which is an objective fact yes or no.

13

Whereas the

What you in effect are saying is that later on you

14

want to know the subjective state of mind of the judge here to

15

determine whether there is an appearance.

16

that the appearance might well have existed, even though he did

17

not realize that there was a disqualifying fact.

18
19
20

MR. FARR:

And I would suggest

Well, I guess that I do at some point part

company on that.
QUESTION:

Is it your position that 455(a) was not

21

violated, or that the vacation of a judgment is an

22

impermissible remedy for a violation of 455(a)?

23

MR. FARR:

It is both.

24

QUESTION:

It is both.

25

MR. FARR:

Our initial position, as I meant to

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

indicate, was that this is not a permissible remedy or not an

2

acceptable remedy, simply for an appearance of impropriety,

3

when you are talking about a motion filed after the fact.

4

is what the Seventh Circuit's rule is.

That

What I am saying in addition though is that because

5
6

of the finding of lack of knowledge, I think that if you credit

7

that, there is not even an appearance of partiality in this

case.
Thank you.

I will reserve my time for rebuttal.

And this

The proceeding was over.

At the time that it was conducted, there was no reason for the
public to question his impartiality.
What you are saying is that the public will not

MR. LUCAS:

At the time of the hearing, I believe

that the public would question his impartiality, yes.

The public did not know.

But the public

At the time of the proceeding, even the parties

that the public would have known.

At that time, the public is expected to

it, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

The public is deemed to know every little

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

detail, even though he is unaware of those details, and even
though he has no obligation to inform himself of those details?
MR. LUCAS:

No, I do not think that the public is

deemed to know every little detail, and that is where the
importance comes in.

I think that the public is to know that

if Loyola owns a 530 acre tract of land, which is what this is,
the equivalent of about seventeen square city blocks, that if
it is going to sell a piece of that land and it is going to
have rezoned 115 acres around it which will increase the value
by $9 million, I think those facts that the public would expect
to be important and would know.
QUESTION:

The public did not know the connection

between this company and that land any more than the judge here
did.
Do you seriously contend that at the time that the
judgment was rendered that there was an appearance of
impropriety?
MR. LUCAS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
There was.

To whom was this appearance manifest, since your
client did not find out about it until how much later?

Maybe

you are guilty of laches then.
MR. LUCAS:

Well, then, too, maybe the court is

guilty of not having revealed it, as it is required to do and
mandated to do.

When it knew it, it did not tell the parties.

Heritage

26
Reporting Corporation

It did not tell the attorneys.

I do not think that under those

circumstances that we should look back and say.
In other words, it seems to me, Justice Scalia, that
if a judge could just keep to himself some interest that would
require his recusal under 455(a), if he could just keep it to
himself under after the judgment is rendered, all is well.

sir.
QUESTION:

10

The minutes of the real estate committee

on January 22 refer to the negotiations with St. Jude Hospital

13

Courts have determined that the certificate of need will be

the Loyola trustees came to be aware of that fact?

MR. LUCAS:

QUESTION:

No, sir, I do not know.

that he should not be sitting in a case like this or anything

like that?

QUESTION:

2

The Loyola people were keeping track of

the case?
MR. LUCAS:

3

Yes.

But again, I must stress the fact

4

that we did not know.

When I say we, HSAC did not know of

5

Loyola's connection with this proceeding until ten months after

the Court of Appeals, the U.S. Fifth Circuit.
I would also like to point out one thing that I think

7
8

also is very worthy of consideration.

And that is that 455

9

applies to criminal cases as well as applying to civil cases.

10

I think that if we were to give the interpretation that

11

Petitioners wish to give to 455, then in U.S. v. Brown, the

12

Defendant would still be in jail, or at least he would have

13

served out his sentence.
Because despite the fact that there was a great

impropriety in that case, the judgment had already been

rendered.

once judgment is rendered that that is it, or once an appeal is

24

exhausted that that is it, then I submit to Your Honors that an

25

injustice in the criminal field as well as the civil could well

37
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

take place.
QUESTION:

Do you think that if you apply a

preponderance of the evidence standard in a criminal case to
determine whether the judge in fact knew of the biasing factor,
do you not think that you would have to apply a beyond a
reasonable doubt standard?
MR. LUCAS:

I do not know, Your Honor.

I confess

that I am out of my field when we are talking about criminal
law.
QUESTION:

If there is more than a fifty percent

chance that the judge was not biased, we are going to let the
person go to jail.
MR. LUCAS:

I doubt that.
This judge in effect acted as a judge in

his own case, once simply by saying I do not remember or I
forget is taken as the basis for saying that he would not be
responsible under 455(a).

To the contrary, the Fifth Circuit

finding that the public would not believe that he was impartial
said that he because of constructive knowledge, things that he
should have known, that he had a duty to inquire into, Justice
O'Connor, under (c), requires that he be found to have had the
requisite knowledge to indicate his impartiality under 455(a).
The record clearly establishes that Justice Collins
attended board meetings on these three occasions that I
mentioned.

Again I wish to particularly stress the

November 21, 1981 board meeting, twenty-nine days before he

38

ruled on a preliminary matter in this case, which you will find

2

on page one of the joint appendix, within twenty-nine days.
We, and when I say we, the members of the public have

3
4

to ask ourselves if we were on a board of trustees that was

5

getting ready to sell a piece of property that had discussed at

6

a number of meetings that we attended, that was one of the

7

principal assets of this institution that we serve, and the

8

surrounding land was going to be increased in value by

9

$9 million, and we voted on the motion to renew the

10

negotiations with these people, Liljeberg and St. Jude, would

11

be twenty-nine days later remember that.
I think that we would.

12

And I think that under that

13

construction, that the court properly found that the public

would not believe Judge Collins forgot.

question really of whether he knew or he did not know, or

16

whether he forgot or he did not forget.

17

whether the public would find that based upon the relevant

18

objective facts that it appeared that the judge was not

impartial.

correctly, that they could not have had any reason to be

And in discussing that

I think that what this case really is coming down to
from the gist of Respondent's argument is the question as to

10

whether you believe Judge Collins or not, and he says that

11

reasonable people in this case will not believe him.

12

And if in fact he did something wrong, certainly the

judgment should be thrown out.

do you have to follow through on in order to reach that

conclusion.

At that point, I do not believe that he

Even if he did, I

QUESTION:

substitute the word "remember" for the word "no"?

That is correct, that is correct.

QUESTION:

It is rather for one Federal Judge to call

another one a liar, is it not?
MR. FARR:

Well, as I have indicated before, Your

Honor, there is a procedure set up for disciplining judges,
which Congress set up six years after it amended 455 that
depends on judges taking responsibility for the conduct of
other judges.
