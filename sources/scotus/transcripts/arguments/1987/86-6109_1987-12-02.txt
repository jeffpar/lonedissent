ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKLYN M. GIMBEL

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GIMBEL:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
This Court has held for more than fifty years that a

13

person accused of a crime may assert entrapment as a defense to

14

such charge.

15

characterized as a judicially fashioned rule to enforce

16

limitations upon the Executive branch of Government in the

17

execution of Federal laws under our Constitution.

18

case of course which was the case that was decided 55 years

19

ago, defined entrapment in the following terms:

In Russell, the entrapment defense was

The Sorrells

20

"The defense is available not in the view that the

21

accused, though guilty, may go free, but that the government

22

cannot be permitted to contend that if government officials are

23

the instigators of the conduct, the person is guilty."

24

essence of the position that we are asserting here today is

25

that while this Court in the four significant cases in which it

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

The

4
1

has addressed the issue of entrapment, Sorrells, Sherman,

2

Russell and Hampton,has dealt various with the prerequisites

3

for the establishment of entrapment as a method by which non­

4

guilt can be established by a person who is the object of

5

government ploy.

6

This Court has not to date dealt with the ground

7

rules by which that issue can get to a person's jury.

8

Consequently, what has developed is a scenario where we have

9

essentially three different predicates for a person who asserts

10

an entrapment defense to get to his or her jury.

11

is accused of a crime, for example, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin —

12

as is the case here — that person must first admit that he or

13

she committed all of the elements of the offense with which he

14

or she is charged, and also that he or she intended to violate

15

the law.

If a person

16

If the same person were accused of the same crime in

17

the District of Columbia, that person would have to admit that

18

he or she participated in the acts which are forbidden by the

19

criminal statute, but not that such conduct was intended to

20

violate the law.

21

In San Francisco or Phoenix, a person who is accused

2-2

of the same crime need not admit to any misconduct, need not

23

admit to in fact having participated in the acts which

24

constitute a violation of the underlying accusation.

25

And so —

QUESTION:

What is your point?

Maybe that's why the

case is here.
MR. GIMBEL:

That's very good, Justice Blackmun.

4

That is why the case is here, but in the government's response

5

to our brief, it seems as though they are suggesting this is an

6

inappropriate case to be a vehicle for addressing the dichotomy

7

of views on how a case gets to the jury, because they argue

8

essentially that there is not a sufficient factual basis for

9

this case to have presented the issue of entrapment

10
11

appropriately.
And I would hope that that would not be used by the

12

Court to sidestep in fact the need to send out a signal to the

13

courts throughout this country as to what in fact is the

14

predicate for a person who asserts that their conduct was not

15

the product of predisposition but rather was as a consequence

16

of the intent which was implanted within their mind by

17

government conduct.

18

Now what rings clearly as essentially the competition

19

in the views of what entrapment is or should be in this Court's

20

cases is, on the one hand, the majority views of Sorrells,

21

Sherman, Russell, and Hampton, that entrapment is in fact a

22

method by which a person who shows inducement can be found not

23

guilty of the offense.

24
25

Whereas, the alternative view that has been at least
articulated by the concurring opinions in Sorrells and Sherman,

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

6
1

and by the dissenting opinions in Hampton and in Russell, is

2

that entrapment should be viewed in the sense of a confession

3

of illegal conduct by an accused individual and the avoidance

4

of the sanctions of that illegal conduct by essentially a

5

forgiveness of the conduct as a matter of public policy in that

6

the government conduct should essentially be a bar to

7

prosecution.

8
9

Now, in Sorrells, the Court very clearly rejected the
notion that entrapment, if asserted as a defense, should be

10

asserted as in essence a plea in bar to the extent that that

11

has any meaning in today's jurisprudence. And if essentially

12

that point of view is viewed as against the decision in this

13

case in the Seventh Circuit, I maintain and urge you to

14

consider that essentially what the Seventh Circuit and other

15

circuits in the country which follow that rule have done is to

16

say to people accused of crime in this country that if you wish

17

to have a jury consider that issue, you must first assume that

18

you have committed all of the elements including intent, and

19

make this confession that was spelled out in Justice Robert's

20

concurring opinion in Sorrells, in Justice Frankfurter's

21

concurring opinion in Sherman, and in the dissenting opinions

22

in Russell and in Hampton.

23

And so I suggest to the Court that if this Court were

24

tempted, as the government urges it to be, to adopt as standard

25

for telling trial courts throughout this country that if an

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

7
1

entrapment issue arises during the course of a case, it must

2

arise in an environment where there is an admission of all of

3

the elements of the offense, including intent.

4

is the posture of the court or the jury forgiving the conduct

5

because it is less egregious than the government conduct which

6

brought it about.

7

And then there

I don't think then for example that this Court could

8

both maintain as precedent on the issue of entrapment the

9

dictates of Sorrells, Sherman, Russell, and Hampton, and adopt

10

the point of view that is expressed in the Seventh Circuit in

11

the Mathews case as the precondition to having the issue

12

considered by a jury.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GIMBEL:

15
16
17
18

Why not?
Because there is a request that there be

a confession by the accused, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Why is that inconsistent with our cases on

entrapment?
MR. GIMBEL:

Because you have said in your cases on

19

entrapment that that is not the rule that is to be applied.

20

Sorrells, there was the contrast between the majority opinion

21

of Justice Hughes and the minority opinion of —

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but we take the majority opinion of

the Chief Justice.
MR. GIMBEL:

Absolutely, yes.

And I say that what

was not adopted by the majority was the notion of confession.

In

1

If you look again at the very basic definition that grows out

2

of Sorrells that is essentially stating the proposition of what

3

entrapment is, it says it is not the view that the accused,

4

though guilty, may go free but that the government cannot be

5

permitted to contend that he is guilty of a crime where the

6

government officials are instigators of the conduct.

QUESTION:

defense.

Yes, but I don't see that lays down much

Certainly, entrapment is an affirmative

It's created by the courts for that situation where,

10

these opinions describe it.

11

natural to have it very narrowly tailored since it isn't the

12

absence of a statutory element at all.

13

think there is a considerable danger of jury confusion if you

14

could just introduce it without a very substantial requirement

15

of a showing such as the Seventh Circuit said.
MR. GIMBEL:

16

And it seems to me it's quite

And I for one would

Well, I respectfully disagree.

I think

17

that juries in this country have been given a great amount of

18

credit for being able to diligently follow the instructions of

19

courts.

20

there have been mid-trial errors and curative instructions and

21

appellate courts have found that traditionally that jurors will

22

follow the instructions of the judge and they will not be

23

dissuaded from their purpose of finding the truth by reason of

24

the fact that during the course of the trial, some incident

25

occurred that was inappropriate. ,

As is legion, there have been frequent occasions where

9

QUESTION:

1
2

Yes, but you agree that the courts of

appeals are split on this question.

3

MR. GIMBEL:

4

QUESTION:

I do.,
And I for one don't see any strong

5

requirement in our precedents, one way or the other.

6

one reason that we should now think about how easily

7

administered is this judicially created defense going to be?
MR. GIMBEL:

8
9

So isn't

I think that it will be more easily

judicially administered if this Court adopts as its standard,

10

as a minimum, the positions that have been asserted and now

11

constitute the law in the District of Columbia, in the Fifth

12

Circuit or in the Ninth Circuit, than following in the Seventh

13

Circuit.

14

only in my view, intrudes into the area that's not been

15

recognized by majority opinion in the landmark cases on this

16

issue as the confession avoidance.

17

the conflict between the requirement that an accused

18

essentially admit to his or her criminal misconduct and his or

19

her Fifth Amendment rights.

Because the Seventh Circuit view essentially, not

But additionally, there is

20

In other words, the essence of the requirement in the

21

Seventh Circuit is that no person accused of crime can consider

22

asserting entrapment as a defense, but for the fact that he or

23

she does in essence incriminate himself of the offense by

24

admitting every aspect of the offense.

25

And while this Court has essentially not yet dealt

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

10
1

with the entrapment defense as rising to the level of giving

2

birth to a Constitutional basis in the entrapment defense, it

3

has said, and in the Russell case, that doesn't mean that some

4

day there might not be a fact situation which will in and of

5

its own essence suggest that there is such an outrageous abuse

6

of those due process fundamentals incorporated in the Fifth

7

Amendment, that it won't view entrapment as having

8

constitutional overtones that have to be addressed by this

9

Court.

10

. QUESTION:

Well, certainly to date, the Court hasn't

11

determined that the Constitution requires the courts to

12

recognize entrapment as a defense.

13

MR. GIMBEL:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.
May I ask you about a minor procedural

15

point.

The government seems to take the position that what we

16

review here is the District Court's denial of the motion for

17

mistrial, rather than the denial of the motion in limine.

18

Do you have a position on that?

19

MR. GIMBEL:

It's one of those six of one, half a

20

dozen of the others.

I think that my colleague, Mr. Kaufman,

21

who assisted me in this and tried the case, was so persuaded

22

that this was an appropriate case for the presentation of the

23

issue of entrapment to the jury that he used every procedural

24

device possible to try to revisit the subject with the trial

25

judge and get the trial judge to find that this case should be

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

11
1

2

considered outside the mold of the Seventh Circuit prohibition.
And so he started with the motion in limine and he

3

ended with the motion for mistrial, but the essence of all of

4

those trial procedures is essentially that the trial judge made

5

an unequivocal decision that declined to submit the issue of

6

entrapment to the jury on the ground of the Seventh Circuit

7

rule against having that issue considered by a jury where

8

there's not first this admission of culpability.

9

government urged as an alternative consideration for the Court

And while the

10

to sidestep giving the issue to the jury, a factual

11

insufficiency, the Judge said that he would not address that as

12

he had already resolved the issue on the first step, although

13

he made a parenthetical side comment that he thought that the

14

evidentiary base was somewhat shaky.

15

QUESTION:

If entrapment is properly raised as a

16

defense in a case, do you take the position that the government

17

is required to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt?

18

MR. GIMBEL:

It is my view, Justice O'Connor, that

19

the courts have spoken on this issue, particularly in D.C., the

20

Fifth and Ninth Circuit, have essentially said this:

21

appropriate for an accused to produce evidence that there was

22

in fact inducement.

23

extensively discusses the burdens of proof — that's a decision

24

that came out of the D.C. Circuit and which was affirmed and

25

followed in the recent case, Kelly case, the court said, it is

It is

And in fact, in the Berkeley case which

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

Corporation

628-4888

12

1

appropriate to place on the defendant — and I'm using the

2

language of that case — the ultimate burden of showing

3

government inducement of the crime, and thus the possibility —

4

and that's the word of the Court — of entrapment.
We do not think that the defendant should bear the

5
6

burden of proving inducement by a preponderance of the

7

evidence, his burden in requiring the prosecution to prove

8

predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt is met by convincing

9

the jury that there is some — and that's another word of the

10

Court — some evidence of government inducement as the term is

11

defined.

12

And then it alludes to how that term is defined.

13

QUESTION:

14

And what's your position on the burden of

proof?

15

MR. GIMBEL:

My position is that once there has been

16

the surface of inducement by the government of the criminal

17

activities of the accused, that then another element of proof

18

that the government must bear is to prove beyond a reasonable

19

doubt that the accused was in fact predisposed.

20

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't we just treat the whole

21

thing as an affirmative defense right down the line?

22

it's judicially created, it isn't an element of the statute at

23

all.

24
25

MR. GIMBEL:

Since

It would appear to me that by doing

that, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be inviting the government

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

13
1

to have no constrictions on their use of deception, decoy,

2

undercover activities, sting and what have you.
QUESTION:

3

No.

If we say it's an affirmative

4

defense, all we're saying is it's an element which the

5

defendant bears the burden of proof on, like self-defense in

6

many States.

7

defense.

8

burden of proof.

9

Now, there's nothing wrong with self-defense as a

But many States require the defendant to bear the

MR. GIMBEL:

In the State of Wisconsin, if you raise

10

the issue of self-defense, then the prosecution has the

11

obligation to show beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense

12

in fact was not the basis upon which the action took.

13

QUESTION:

Well, there are fifty different States,

14

and I dare say they have many different rules.

15

shouldn't the defendant be required to bear the burden of

16

proof?

17

Statute have been satisfied.

18

the other cases, the Court has said, well, it just isn't

19

right, even though all the other elements are proved, for the

20

Government to be able to get a conviction on this case if

21

there's this entrapment and the other thing.

22

23
24
25

But why

This has nothing to do -- all the elements of the
And in Sorrells and Sherman and

But nothing you've said thus far seems to be a very
good reason why it shouldn't be an affirmative defense.
MR. GIMBEL:

I don't think it would be efficient

productive jurisprudence to lay upon a person accused of a

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

14

1

crime any more burdens that he or she might otherwise have.

2

And I think that it is consistent with an accused due process

3

rights under the Fifth Amendment that he or she can rely on his

4

or her presumption of innocence, and that once they show that

5

that innocence, if it has been intruded into as in the case of

6

an entrapment situation, by inducement, that it is better law

7

for there to remain an obligation on the Government power

8

bringing the case to hold and continue to have the burden of

9

proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

10
11

QUESTION:

But it's certainly not a.n element of the

crime that we're talking about, is it?

12

MR. GIMBEL:

13

QUESTION:
«

Is what an element, Justice White?
I mean, even if you said the Government

14

ought to have the burden, I don't know why proving

15

predisposition, why do you say it has to be proved beyond a

16

reasonable doubt?

17

It's not an element of the crime?

MR. GIMBEL:

I am echoing the sentiments which I urge

18

this Court to adopt of circuit courts which have held that

19

predisposition should be treated in the exact same way as any

20

other statutory element of an offense.

21

ultimately what the government has to overcome.

22

entrapment or if government actions would get in the way of the

23

conclusion that a person has violated the law, then it is

24

incumbent upon the government to prove beyond a reasonable

25

doubt that in fact they can satisfy either the court or jury,

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you would argue then that

I would argue that the defendant should

9

raising the issue.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GIMBEL:

But not

What have we held with respect to that?
I don't know.

I can't say.

I don't know that that's

12

been addressed.

But, yes, I would urge that

13

self-defense, like predisposition in an entrapment case is a

14

matter which should reside within the obligation of the

15

government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

And I think that the logic that is included in the

17

rationale of those cases which have held that an accused can

18

claim that he or she did not intentionally violate the law, and

19

yet have the issue of entrapment submitted to his or her jury

20

is sound, and it is far more sound than the logic that

21

antedates the rationale which brings us here today, the rule of

22

the Seventh Circuit.

23

because it makes impotent the claim that the government

24

misbehaved in a case in those jurisdictions without a great

25

sacrifice on the part of the accused.

That makes no sense at all, in my view,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
Mr. Gimbel spent I think most of his time talking

10
11

about the inconsistency question in this case, and I'll reach

12

that in a little while and explain why we think he's wrong on

13

that.

14

But before I do, there is a prior question in this

15

case, one which we think is logically precedent to that issue,

16

and one which is of considerable practical importance:

17

is, when is there sufficient evidence in a case to bring an

18

entrapment defense to the jury in the first place.

has to appreciate what went on in this case.

quite clear that on these facts, which are repeated in closely

varying forms many times everyday in many undercover

operations, petitioner has not produced sufficient evidence to

bring his entrapment instruction.

10

QUESTION:

Now, we think it is

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, we granted certiorari

11

on the question that Mr. Gimbel argued.

12

that the Government isn't entitled to argue something if you

13

think it would preempt the others, but certainly you're not

14

arguing the question that we granted certiorari on?

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

No.

was the issue presented in the petition, and as I say, I will

courts decided the case on.
MR. ROTHFELD:

That is also correct, Justice White.

21

The reason we advance our alternative ground for decision, it

is certainly an alternative ground for affirmance.

23

ground that was advanced in the lower courts and advanced in

MR. ROTHFELD:

The Courts of Appeals have generally,

25

Heritage

Corporation

21

extent on the question of predisposition that lies on the

2

defendant.

3

it shifts to the government to disprove, prove predisposition

4

beyond a reasonable doubt.

That once the defendant has satisfied this burden,

5

QUESTION:

Do you agree with that?

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

We have no quarrel with that.

That is

7

the usual standard that is applied by the Federal courts where

8

affirmative defenses are involved, except in the insanity case

9

where Congress changed that by statute in 1984.

Although

10

again, it is clear that Congress or in the absence of

11

congressional action, the Court can place the burden, allocate

12

the burden however it wishes.

13

In order to resolve what I think is a very important

14

legal threshold question when entrapment instruction should go

15

to the jury, it is essential to start with a number of

16

characteristics of the entrapment defense.

17

think, is fair to say, is a curious doctrine and its origins

18

and rationale are somewhat obscure and have been hotly debated

19

by the courts.

20

point quite clear, as Mr. Gimbel suggested.

Entrapment, I

But the definition of entrapment is at this

A defendant, to make out a case of entrapment must

21
22

show that government action induced criminal conduct on the

23

part of someone who was not predisposed to commit the crime,

24

someone who is the unwary innocent described in this Court's

25

opinions.

Several things follow directly from this definition

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

22

1

of entrapment.

2

often said that the entrapment defense is designed to protect

3

innocent people against overzealous police conduct, an

4

entrapped defendant is not an entirely nonculpable defendant

5

and a simple example makes this clear.

6

First, it is quite clear that although it is

If someone is induced to commit a crime by his friend

7

or his brother-in-law or by any private party, he has no

8

entrapment defense.

9

long as it falls short of duress, that person will be convicted

10
11

No matter how powerful the inducement, so

at trial.
Now, when the government provides the inducement,

12

there may be some reason — and the Court has found a reason to

13

create a defense —- but the complete lack of blameworthiness on

14

the part of the defendant is not one of those reasons.

15

must be some other reason to let someone go after he has in

16

fact committed all the elements of the offense with the

17

requisite mental state.

18

There

A second thing follows from the definition of

entrapment.

20

prophylactic rule that prevents the police from making

21

criminals out of otherwise law abiding people.

22

of the defendant as otherwise law abiding we think is critical.

23

It means that the kind of government conduct that may give rise

24

to an entrapment defense is conduct that is calculated to make

25

a normally law abiding person commit a crime, conduct that

The entrapment doctrine is often said to act as a

But the status

3

And even in those circumstances where there is this

4

sort of coercive conduct, an entrapment defense is not

5

necessarily made out no matter how coercive the government's

6

action, a defendant will be convicted if he was predisposed to

7

commit the crime, if he was the unwary criminal and not the

unwary innocent described in this Court's opinions.

Now, these characteristics of entrapment tell us

something very important about the defense.

claim to the jury.

17

It is a very

It comes into play only at the intersection

And this central fact about entrapment

First, in a formula used by Judge McGowan, among many

other lower court judges, defendant must show inducement of a

19

sort that might realistically be expected to lead a normally

21

enough to satisfy this requirement that the government is the

By the same token, a simple criminal proposition or

simple solicitation of the defendant, a simple offer of a

3

payoff cannot be enough to raise inducement.

4

always emphasized that the government must be free to present

5

opportunities or the facilities for the commission of crime.

6

And again, in Judge McGowan's observation is a general

7

behavioral assumption that people should not have difficulty

8

resisting criminal temptations, no matter how tempting the

9

offer.

10
11

The Court has

When the offer stands alone without more, it is

something we expect people to resist.
And again examples make this quite clear.

If an

12

undercover policeman approaches someone on the street and

13

offers to buy heroin from that person or offers to sell him

14

stolen goods, or offers him a payoff, that person if he accepts

15

the transaction clearly has not been entrapped because that's

16

the sort of thing we expect everyone to be able to resist

17

without any difficulty.

18

For inducement to be present in a case, there must be

19

something more than that.

20

of coercion in the government's conduct, or some powerful

21

appeal to sympathy.

abiding person might have committed the crime, and something

that serves to mitigate that person's involvement in the crime,

something that gives us a good reason to let him off.

which evidence of that kind might come out on cross

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

No

It is certainly possible to imagine

such a case, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

And you wouldn't deprive the defendant in

those circumstances of the alternative instruction?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the. courts of appeals have taken

11

inconsistent positions, and as we explained in our brief, there

12

is no need to decide that in this case because the defendant

13

himself took the stand.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, but I'm asking you now.
Well, our preferred approach -- and we

16

understand that there is a close question as to which of the

17

two approaches is preferable -- our preferred approach is the

18

Seventh Circuit's approach, as I'll explain later on at the end

19

of my argument.

20

special care of the entrapment defense should not be entitled

21

to argue to the jury simultaneously that he was not guilty of

22

the crime, because the existence of entrapment presupposes the

23

existence of all of the elements of the offense.

24
25

We think that a defendant who is seeking the

As I say, we understand that when the defendant has
not himself taken the stand, or introduced evidence which is

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

26
1

directly inconsistent with that, the inconsistency is not quite

2

so powerful as it is in this case.

3

our position on that in more detail at the tail end of my

4

argument.

5

But as I say, I'll explain

We think and my focus now is we hope the Court uses

6

it to dispose of this case is the ground that because there was

7

no coercion, no powerful appeal to sympathy of this sort, no

8

overbearing government conduct, there could not have been and

9

clearly was not inducement.

10
11

And when there is no inducement,

the case should not go to the jury.
There is of course a second prerequisite to the

12

entrapment defense, that is, the existence of predisposition.

13

Defendant who wants the benefit of the entrapment defense must

14

have been at least persuaded to commit the crime.

15

have been waiting for an opportunity that the government

16

happened to present to him.

17

easy to separate predisposed and unpredisposed defendants,

18

certainly a defendant who jumps at a criminal opportunity, in

19

Judge Friendly's words, who was ready and willing to commit the

20

crime without persuasion, cannot assert that he lacked

21

predisposition.

22

that there was a lack of predisposition, the courts are quite

23

clear -- or at least many courts have held that entrapment

24

should not go to the jury.

25

He could not

ANd while it may not always be

And without at least some evidence in the case

And we think that's appropriate.

As I say, in making this argument, we are not asking

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

27
1

the Court to make any factual findings.

2

accepting the petitioner's own account of the crime, own

3

account of what happened here, his own account of the

4

inducement and his reaction to it, the Court can decide and

5

should decide as a matter of law that there was no entrapment

6

and therefore the issue should not have gone to the jury.

7

QUESTION:

We think that

What if we don't want to go off on that

8

ground and instead we want to decide the issue on which cert

9

was granted?

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, if the Court were to. conclude

11

that that were the logically precedent question to decide, we

12

certainly don't have any quarrel with that.

13

suggest that it might be appropriate in that case for the Court

14

to then go on and resolve what we have called the first

15

question in the case, and conclude that although defendants may

16

legally be entitled to present alternative arguments, this

17

defendant with his showing was not entitled to bring his

18

entrapment defense to the jury, and dispose of the case on that

ground.

24

I'm just asking whether you're going to argue the

MR. ROTHFELD:

I will argue that.

Let me simply then

make one final point on our first submission, Justice O'Connor.

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

28
1

The reason that we think it is quite clear that the

2

Court will not have to make factual findings and why it is an

3

important legal principle that should be settled in this case,

4

can be found from looking at the facts of this case, which I

5

suggested at the outset are typical of undercover operations.

6

Here there was as I suggested a simple offer and

7

acceptance, in fact a series of offers and acceptances.

8

was no coercion, there were no attempts at persuasion.

9

was nothing that could be remotely called overbearing on the

There

10

part of the government.

11

petitioner himself was able to say was that the government

12

agent told him that if he didn't take the money quickly, the

13

agent would spend it himself so that his wife wouldn't find it.

14

In arguing for inducement, all the

Putting this sort of time limit on a criminal

15

proposal we think is clearly not overbearing and is not the

16

sort of thing that should lead anybody to commit an offense.

17

And as I said, a defendant who cannot show inducement beyond a

18

simple offer and acceptance is not entitled to bring his case

19

to the jury.

20

While that's enough to dispose of our first argument,

21

I should add it is quite clear that the defendant in this case

22

was in fact predisposed to commit the crime.

23

simple offer and acceptance.

24

expressed in interest in the first offer.

25

that he expressed interest in all the subsequent offers.

There was a

1

conceded that he took the money without hesitation.

His only

2

excuse was that he viewed the payoff as a personal loan and not

3

an illegal gratuity but that excuse was conclusively rejected

4

by the jury.
Now, on the second point, which we think provides an

5
6

independent and equally fundamental reason for denying an

7

entrapment instruction here, a point that Justice O'Connor has

8

asked about and that was the focus of the Court of Appeals'

9

opinion.

The Court of Appeals noted, we think, obviously

10

correctly, that the defendant's simultaneous attempt to say

11

that he did not commit the crime, and to argue entrapment as an

12

alternative ground for acquittal presented inconsistent

13

defenses.

The question arises with great frequency in

11

And I think the reason for that is that defendants

generally perceive that they will so damage their credibility

if they make clearly inconsistent defenses before a jury, that

part is, everything to do with this loan was induced by him.

He came in, he offered me very favorable interest rates, he

offered me more money than I needed, and so forth and so on,

and therefore, I was persuaded to take this loan.
Maybe that's not sufficient entrapment, but why is it

intent, and, b), to the extent I did anything wrong, I was

entrapped?

not understand that I was doing something illegal and did not

intend to do something illegal, and then asks the jury to find

I was entrapped, which by definition means that I had the

implanted in me by the government, those two propositions

But he's

And in fact

Isn't he really saying that the element of

intent was not mine, it was really the government's?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, if he did not believe in this

24

case that he was taking the money for an improper purpose as a

25

gratuity rather than as a personal loan, he would not be guilty

of the crime,' he would not have committed all of the elements

2

of the offense.

That was what he asserted was true.

And for him to say that the government intended for

3
4

this money to be an illegal gratuity but that was not my

5

intent, he is denying one of the elements of the offense.
QUESTION:

6

What's wrong with the inconsistent

7

defenses, assuming I believe that they're inconsistent.

8

what?
MR. ROTHFELD:

9

So

I hope you do believe they're

10

inconsistent, Justice White.

11

we think are wrong with it.

12

— particularly in the entrapment setting — when a defendant

13

has taken the stand and has advanced his view of the case, he's

14

obviously entitled to testify, but he's not entitled to testify

15

untruthfully, and he can fairly be held to the story that he

16

tells on the stand.

17

with his having been entrapped, we think for him to ask for

18

acquittal on entrapment grounds is to ask for a windfall

19

acquittal, which is not justified on his stated view of the

20

facts.

21

And there are several things that
First of all, when a defendant has

this defense.

11

Now, certainly when a defendant believes that there

12

are factual grounds that exist that support his claim that he

13

did not factually commit the crime, he's entitled to present

14

those grounds.

15

grounds that exist that prove that he was entrapped, he is

16

entitled to make those arguments.

17

And when a defendant believes there are factual

But we don't see an impropriety in saying that given

the nature of the entrapment defense, he should be put to his

choice.

20

QUESTION:

Are you saying it's the same reason you

21

don't allow inconsistent testimony in other respects why you

22

would not allow a defendant to come in and perjure himself to

23

say one thing and then say, but if you don't believe that, then

24

I testify to the opposite, because it does not help the truth

seeking process.

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is certainly a major part of our

argument.

Yes, but why do you presume there's false

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the jury's conviction in the

13

QUESTION:

15

Yes, but he's been convicted here, but

MR. ROTHFELD:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Well, that is certainly true, Justice.

You don't presume he's going to give you

false testimony.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that is true.

But when a

23

defendant takes the stand and denies the commission of the

24

crime, it is inconsistent with that denial for him to say to

25

the jury that I was entrapped into committing this crime.

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

And

38
1

we think that it is inappropriate to allow a defendant to

2

present two inconsistent grounds, what Judge Gee called a

3

smorgasbord of inconsistent defenses that a jury can pick and

4

choose from.

5

And I emphasize it is certainly true that this

6

argument depends in large part on the grounds that we want to

7

advance in the truth seeking function of the trial but we think

8

it is particularly powerful in the entrapment setting, because

9

entrapment , the court has emphasized for a variety of reasons is

10

a narrow defense.

11

special benefit that no one else whose acquitted on affirmative

12

defense grounds receives.

13

Defendant is in a sense being given a

QUESTION:

Is it not correct that the reasons you

14

advance for your position would apply equally to self-defense,

because there's an inconsistency there too.

argue that you cannot plead self-defense, because that's not

the true story if you really are guilty.

to do it if you plead not guilty.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well,

You might well

You shouldn't be able

I'll give you two answers to

20

that, three answers.

To the extent that there is an

21

inconsistency in someone who advances another affirmative

22

defense, and a defense to an element of the offense, our

23

argument would apply in that setting.

24

two inconsistent statements before the jury and we think that

25

is inappropriate.

Heritage

That person is advancing

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

39

However, we think that the argument that we're making

1

2

has special force in the entrapment setting because of the

3

particular nature of the entrapment is something which does not

4

entirely excuse the defendant, we think —
QUESTION:

5

Because it's not obvious that there's any

6

inconsistency, whereas it is obvious in these other cases

7

there's an inconsistency.
MR. ROTHFELD:

8
9

Not at all, Justice Stevens.

In many

cases involving other affirmative defenses, there will not be

10

an inconsistency in a defendant who says I'm insane and I

11

didn't know where I was on the day of crime.

12

you haven't proved me guilty, but if I did it, I must have been

13

insane.

14
15
16

And therefore,

Those are not necessarily inconsistent.
QUESTION:

They certainly are because if he's insane,

he probably couldn't have had the intent to commit the crime.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, he may say that he factually

17

doesn't know where he was on the day of the crime.

18

have physically committed the act, but if he committed the act,

19

he must have been insane because he is insane.

20

necessarily inconsistent.

21

to be true.

22

He may not

Those are not

A jury can find both of those things

That is not true in the entrapment setting.

A jury

23

cannot find that the defendant lacked the requisite mental

24

state as he has testified, and that the defendant was entrapped

25

into committing the crime, which as I say presupposes the

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
628-4888

(202)

40
1

mental state having been implanted in his mind by the

2

government.
QUESTION:

3

What about self defense.

Are you allowed

4

to make a self defense claim and at the same time, deny the

5

killing.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we were unable to find any

7

authority on that point, and I think it is difficult to imagine

8

a realistic case in which that will arise.
QUESTION:

9

You don't ordinarily have the nicety of

10

pleading in a criminal case.

11

the arguments as to what defense is yours come out in the

12

arguments on jury instructions, don't they, rather than just on

13

pleas?

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

You have a not guilty plea.

That's typically true.

And

A defendant

15

who having advanced his claim that he factually was not guilty

16

at the close of trial we think should for that reason be

17

foreclosed from advancing the entrapment affirmative defense.

18

If he wants to make entrapment as an affirmative defense, he is

19

free to do so, but he ought to choose that course of litigation

20

strategy at the outset of the trial.

21

QUESTION:

Of course, what makes this difficult is

22

that we normally think that the government is put to its proof

23

in these criminal cases, and the jury may look at

24

circumstantial evidence to determine that the defendant had the

25

requisite intent to commit the substantive offense, and it may

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

41

1

not, the defendant may believe he didn't have the intent.

2

may sincerely believe that.

3

the circumstantial evidence may find he did.

4

He

And yet, the jury, on the basis of

Now, is the defendant then to be deprived of an

5

argument to the jury based on other evidence that entrapment

6

then is appropriate for him to urge to the jury?

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, it is certainly true that the

8

defendant generally may put the government to its proof.

But

9

entrapment of course is an affirmative defense, and the burden

10

can be placed wherever the court finds that it's appropriate.

11

And we think given the unique nature of entrapment as the sort

12

of affirmative defense which avoids the defendant's guilt that

13

he it should not be permitted to make these torts in

14

inconsistent arguments.

15

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANKLYN M. GIMBEL

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

21

22

MR. GIMBEL:

Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court.
I would like to address the comments of Justice

23

Scalia, Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor, on what I

24

believe to be uniquely in this case the lack of inconsistency

25

between what Mr. Mathews did at the trial and his being in an

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

42
1

appropriate position to have his jury consider the entrapment

2

defense.

3

In fact, while the facts are kind of immaterial to

4

the ultimate call in this case by the Court, it is not Mr.

5

Mathews view that the entrapment defense should be revisited

6

and changed in this case.

7

that an accused must first show that he was induced to do

8

something improper, and secondly that there must be a

9

demonstration that he was not otherwise predisposed once the

10
11

We're willing to settle on the fact

activities were undertaken.
But in this case, Mr. Mathews was accused of having

12

received a gratuity, and the facts show that Mr. Mathews was a

13

long time associate and friend of the government agent.

14

had a personal relationship away from their business

15

relationship.

16

occasions, prior to the time when Mr. DeShazer who was the

17

person who put the money in Mr. Mathews' hand and who was

18

working under the tutelage of the FBI and recording

19

conversations between them took place.

20

They

They had in fact exchanged finances on prior

And so Mr. Mathews was essentially confronted with

21

this dilemma. And I think in this case, uniquely so because as

22

Justice Stevens appropriately pointed out, the call on whether

23

or not Mr. Mathews could get the entrapment defense submitted

24

to his jury was made before the case began.

25

for Mr. Mathews, it would be incumbent upon his trial lawyer to

Heritage

And so, as counsel

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

43

1

say, look, Fred, if you want to go to this jury on the issue of

2

the fact that the government really induced you into this

3

conduct, you can't get up on that witness stand and tell that

4

jury that you did not intend to give him something in the

5

nature of some official performance on your part in exchange

6

for this loan.

7

And Mr. Mathews had to make the call.

That would be dishonest.

I did not anticipate that

8

receiving this money was in any way connected to my position as

9

an employee of the government and his position as a client of

10

the government.. And there's testimony that supports that.
QUESTION:

11

Why is it any different than the position

12

of a defendant that's accused of murder who really believes

13

that he didn't kill the individual, someone else pulled the

14

trigger.

15

with a knife, and if he did kill him, it was in self-defense.

On the other hand, the individual was rushing at him

MR. GIMBEL:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GIMBEL:

19

QUESTION:

I don't think it's different.
It isn't different.
No.
And you don't think that that's

20

contradictory testimony: number one, I didn't kill him, and

21

number two, I killed him in self defense?

22
23
24
25

MR. GIMBEL:

No.

I would say it's contradictory but

I don't know that the jury can't consider both issues.
QUESTION:

I don't think we're arguing really about

whether this is any different from any other contradictory

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

44
1

testimony.

2

reason to exclude contradictory testimony in a criminal trial.

3

I don't see how this is any less contradictory than any other.

4

I think we're arguing about whether there's any

MR. GIMBEL:

And my posture is that we should not

5

exclude contradictory testimony.

6

sense to exclude it because an argument can't be made that it's

7

not contradictory in a rather global sense.

8

it's not so global.

9

Justice Stevens came up with a hypothetical and while it didn't

That it doesn't make any

And in this case,

It's pretty narrowed down.

And I think

10

apply to this case, the fact that a person works for the

11

government, another person's a client of the government in that

12

particular agency and there's a financial transaction between

13

them that essentially doesn't have any co-relationship to each

14

other would be an appropriate basis for that particular

15

individual to say, no, I didn't violate the law.

16

Yes, I took money, Yes, I'm an employee of the

17

government, yes, this person's a client of the government.

18

all of these things were done under the inducement of the

19

client of the government, and that's what happened here.

20

he said, I'm not guilty because I didn't put those two things

21

together.

22

They can put that together and say, well, Mr. Mathews, we don't

23

agree with your conclusion that you're not guilty.

24

you are, we think there was a relationship.

25

But

And

As Justice O'Connor suggested, the jury can do that.

QUESTION:

We think

But there is an issue here, how far the

by the courts.

3

MR. GIMBEL:

4

QUESTION:

The defense was thought up

Exactly.
I suppose we could say that the entrapment

5

defense is available but only where there's an admission of all

6

the elements of the crime.

7

MR. GIMBEL:

You can say that.

8

because it doesn't make any sense.

9

would promote perjury.

10

QUESTION:

I'm hoping you won't

More often, it seems to me,

It makes some sense in the terms of just

11

how often and under what circumstances is entrapment available

12

to a person whose committed a crime.

13

MR. GIMBEL:

That I understand, Justice White.

But

14

what I don't understand is that essentially there is this very

15

confined area within which a person can say I want my jury to

16

consider government conduct in my case.

17

And in Mr. Mathews case what he needed to do, based

18

on the Seventh Circuit rule, in order to get his jury to

19

consider whether the government activity in his case was

20

inappropriate, was to say, I did it, I was wrong in every

21

single respect, even though he didn't believe he was.

22

QUESTION:

Well, it would have been available if

23

there had been the proper groundwork if he had just stayed off

24

the stand, is that right?

25

MR. GIMBEL:

No. Not true.

In the Seventh Circuit,

by the government.

12

Now, it is an inconsistency.

Maybe you don't mind

inconsistency in criminal trials, but the advantage of it is

It's from his

And Mr. Mathews was entitled to say I did not intend

Heritage

Reporting
(202)

47

1

to relate this loan to some improper government conduct.

2

that's not inconsistent with his saying that, I did take the

3

money, and I did have some dealings with this man, and they

4

superimposed this intent, they juxtaposed the intent on me in

5

the scheme of their dealings with me.

6

And

And so while I don't need to say that at least in my

7

view, I don't need to convince you that inconsistent defenses

8

should never be allowed, because I don't believe that, but I

9

think in this case that the truth is something that is so

10

elusive when it comes to intent, that Mr. Mathews was not

11

necessarily playing a game, when he said, jury, I didn't do

12

this to violate the law, and yet whatever I did, I did because

13

of the creative activity of the government, and so I should

14

have had my jury decide, first, did I do this to violate the

15

law, and then once reaching that, did I do this because the

16

government essentially made me do it, or induced me by their

17

creative activity to do it.

18

And I think that that's what Mr. Mathews was entitled

19

to, and I think that the Seventh Circuit rule on the subject

20

matter is too confining and it's not good law and you ought to

21

look elsewhere for your decision.

22

there in this circuit, in the Fifth Circuit in eloquently

23

argued cases, and even beyond that in the Ninth Circuit where

And that's probably the truth.

And so, in conclusion, I urge you, as I know you

3

will, to look very closely at the unfairness — and that's what

4

it really is — the unfairness of the constrictions that were

5

placed upon Mr. Mathews and anyone else similarly situated by
