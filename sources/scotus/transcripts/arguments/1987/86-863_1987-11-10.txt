ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. MERRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is a decision in the Health
Care Financing Administration, a unit in the Department of

10

Health and Human Services disapproving a proposed amendment to

11

California's state Medicaid plan.

12

one of statutory construction:

13

conclude that the California amendment violate the plain and

14

unequivocal language of Section 1903(f) of the Medicaid Act, or

15

is there some escape route from this conclusion, as the Court

16

of Appeals found, and as the Respondents maintain?

The question is ultimately

did the Administrator properly

17

Section 1903(f) provides that when a state elects to

18

participate in a Medicaid program, the federal government will

19

reimburse the state only for families whose income after

20

medical expenses falls below a certain cap.

21

sets that cap at 4/3rds the highest amount ordinarily paid by

22

the state under the AFDC program to a family of the same size

23

having no income or resources.

24
25

Section 1903(f)

In other words, if the highest amount ordinarily paid
to an AFDC family of two, without any income and resources is

$300 a month, then the cap on federal financial participation

2

for a family of two would be $400 a month.
In September 1 83 California submitted an amendment

3

to its Medicaid plan to the Administrator of the Health Care

5

Financing Administration.

6

adult couples and only for adult couples, that the medically

7

needy income level would be 4/3rds the highest amount

8

ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of three.

The amendment provided that for

In its application, which we have reproduced at page

14

excluding these excess payments from future requests for

15

federal reimbursement.

4

violated the plain terms of the statute and the regulations.

5

An adult couple is a family of two; a family
Thus, the

The fact that the statute gives the Secretary

authority to prescribe standards does not change this

conclusion.

for determining the amount of benefits ordinarily paid to a

9

family of a given size.

10
11

The Secretary is empowered only to set standards

He is not empowered to set standards

for determining what "same size" means.
In any event, the Secretary has exercised the

12

delegated authority given by Section 1903(f).

13

regulations, which remained unchanged in this respect since

14

1971, state that the cap on federal financial participation is

15

to be determined for any given family, including adult couples,

16

by looking to the amount ordinarily received by an AFDC family

17

of the same size.

18

The Secretary's

Thus, if there were any doubt about the meaning of

19

the statute created by the delegation to set standards to the

20

Secretary, it is in Judge Kozinski's phrase, "neatly excised by

21

the regulations.

22

Three arguments have been advanced in this case in an

23

effort to defeat the plain import of this statute and the

24

regulations.

First the Ninth Circuit held that the California

internal agency manual.

And that this manual was a legislative

2

regulation binding on the Agency.
Second, the respondents maintain that, even if the

3
4

manual was not a legislative regulation, it was at least a

5

valid guideline and as such is entitled to deference by the

6

courts.

7

Third, both the courts of appeals and the Respondent

8

claim that Congress, when it enacted the Deficit Reduction Act

9

in 1984, intended to permit the California amendment.

10
11

I would

address each of these three contentions in turn:
The primary theory of the court of appeals was that a

12

certain manual provision, the so-called ROM 2572-D, was a

13

legislative regulation.

14

this Court and with good reason.

15

question is part of a loose-leaf manual intended by use by

16

Agency employees only.

17

Health and Human Services, the only person in the Agency who

18

has the authority to issue substantive regulations; it was not

19

issued after public notice and comment procedures as is

20

required by the APA and longstanding Agency policy; it was not

21

published in the Code of Federal Regulations; indeed, it was

22

not even published in the Federal Register, the requisite for

23

all substantive regulations under the APA.

24

Appeals Rationale simply cannot be squared with fundamental

25

tenets of administrative law.

No one seeks to defend this theory in

As Judge Kozinski put it,

"it would create

2

uncertainty; breed litigation; and invite judicial intrusion

3

into the affairs of administrative agencies."

4

Although they disclaim any reliance on the court of

5

appeals theory, Respondents nevertheless argue that the manual

6

provision is a valid guideline, and as such, is entitled to

7

deference by the courts.

important sources for resolving legal disputes that arise under

9

the Social Security Act.

QUESTION:

We agree that Agency manuals can be

Did the Secretary ever direct any â€”

anyone to use it?
MR. MERRILL:

No, Justice White.

There is no

13

indication that the so-called "ROM provision" was in fact ever

14

applied in any particular case involving any state, let alone

15

this State.

16

the Administrator in this State it was promptly disavowed and

17

the Administrator consistently held that it violated the State

18

statute and regulations.

When the provision was drawn to the attention of

19

There is a reference in the ROM to the State of

20

Montana, but there is no evidence that we can locate that

21

Montana in fact ever attempted to set its medically need income

22

level based on a family of three for couples rather than two.

23

The contention that somehow the courts should give

24

deference to the ROM provision in this case, even if it is not

25

a legislatively binding regulation, we do not think bears any

7

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

scrutiny.
The decision in this case was not one to enforce the

2

3

ROM.

The decision was one to repudiate the manual.

In this

4

context, if the manual is not a legislatively-binding

5

regulation, then the only questions it presented are whether

6

the Agency adopted a rational construction of its own statute

7

and regulations, and in light of that interpretation, whether

8

its decision to repudiate the manual is arbitrary, capricious,

9

or an abuse of discretion.
We do not think there can be any serious dispute

10
11

about the answers to these inquiries.

Even if one somehow

12

imagines that Section 1903(f) creates an ambiguity and allows

13

the Secretary to determine that "same size" means that a couple

14

is different from a family of two, the Administrator did not

15

interpret this statute that way.

16

case found that the same size family means what it says, that a

17

"couple" is a "family of two," and not a "family of three."

The Administrator in this

This was clearly a rational construction of the

18
19

statute and once that construction was made it followed as a

20

matter of course that the Agency manual had to be repudiated.

21

An Agency manual simply cannot trump a duly-enacted statute of

22

Congress or a duly-promulgated Agency regulation.
Nor do we think there can be any contention in this

23
24

case that California relied to its detriment on the Agency

25

manual.

In April 1983, the California Department of Health

8

Heritage

1

Services prepared an analysis of proposed legislation that

2

ultimately led to the State plan amendment at issue in this

3

case.

4

provisions have no regulatory authority," and it cautioned

5

that, "federal approval would very likely not be granted."

That analysis noted that, "regional office manual

6

Later in August 1983, the same California Department

7

again concluded that the California Amendment was in violation

8

of the federal cap.

9

To make doubly sure, the California department wrote

10

to the Administrator and asked for a formal Opinion about

11

whether or not the proposed plan would be acceptable under

12

federal law.

13

and unequivocally informed the Department that its proposed

14

plan would violate Section 1903(f) and the implementing

15

regulations.

16

The Administrator wrote back in September of 1983

Notwithstanding these repeated warnings, that the

17

manual provision was unlawful and that the proposed plan

18

amendment would be disapproved, California filed its amendment

19

anyway.

20

We would submit that this history demonstrates that,

21

although California was no doubt attempting to exploit the

22

manual, it was not in any sense relying on it.

23

The final argument that has been advanced for

24

avoiding the plain language of Section 1903(f) in the

25

regulations is based on the so-called "DEFRA moratorium."

Heritage

1

Section 2373 of the Deficit Reduction Act, or "DEFRA," directs

2

the Secretary not to take any compliance action against a state

3

by reason of the state's medicaid plan being in violation of a

4

certain provision of the medicaid statute.
The section that is referred to in the moratorium is

5
6

the subsection of Section 1902(a) of the medicaid statute, a

7

provision that had been added by the Tax Equity and Fiscal

8

Responsibility Act of 1982 or TEFRA.

The moratorium does not

10

participation which was relied upon by the Administrator in

11

this case.

12

argument, and we think the complete answer, is that the

13

moratorium concerns a different statutory requirement not

14

relied upon by the Administrator and is simply irrelevant.

So the short answer to the DEFRA moratorium

The legislative history confirms this analysis.

15

The

16

primary purpose of the DEFRA moratorium, as the legislative

17

history makes clear, was to give the states greater flexibility

18

in measuring income and resources in determining eligibility.

19

As this Court explained in its Opinion in Adkins v

20

TEFRA required the states to use the same methodology in

21

measuring and resources for all goods of medicaid recipients.

22

DEFRA imposed a moratorium on this provision.

23

not present any issue about measurement of income and

24

resources.

25

participation that applies after the measurement process is

Rivera,

This case does

It concerns only the cap on federal financial

10

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1
2

complete.
TEFRA also required the states to use a single

3

standard of eligibility requirements for all groups of medicaid

4

recipients.

5

although not the Administrator, interpreted the single standard

6

to mean, among other things, that the states had to set the

7

same eligibility requirements for families consisting of one

8

adult and a child and families consisting of two adults.

9

After TEFRA was enacted, some agency employees,

If this were the correct interpretation, then the

10

DEFRA moratorium would mean that states could now set different

11

eligibility standards for adult couples and families consisting

12

of one adult and a child.

13

different relative standards for families consisting of two

14

adults and families consisting of an adult and a child does not

15

mean that either standard can correlate the cap set by section

16

1403(f) â€” 1903(f), excuse me, of the Act.

17

But just because the states can set

To return to my earlier example, if the amount

18

ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of two is $300, and the

19

Section 1903(f) cap for a family of two is therefore $400,

20

DEFRA would permit a state to set the medically needy income

21

level for an adult couple at $400, and to set the medically

22

needy income level for a family consisting of one adult and a

23

child at something lower, such as $350.

24
25

But there is nothing in DEFRA that permits states to
violate the federal cap either for adult couples or for any

11

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

other type of family.

2

this it has been resolved by a recent amendment to the DEFRA

3

moratorium enacted just this past August designed to clarify

4

which provisions of the Medicaid Act are covered by the

5

moratorium.

6

legislative history because Congress specifically made the

7

effective date of the clarification retroactive back to the

8

date of the enactment of DEFRA.

QUESTION:

May I ask about that Act?

MR. MERRILL:

That is correct, Justice Stevens.

It

was in August.
QUESTION:

Is that an appropriate â€” can Congress

enact a statute that tells us how to decide a case?
MR. MERRILL:

Well, there is nothing in the

16

clarification that was passed in August that suggests that

17

Congress was aiming at this particular case.

There is a bill

18
19
20

21

QUESTION:

What other is â€” no other state does this,

does it, or does Nebraska do it, too?
MR. MERRILL:

Well, no.

The clarification that was

22

passed in August was intended to clarify that the moratorium on

23

TEFRA extended to certain issues under TEFRA that were not

24

absolutely clear under the initial moratorium.

25

clarification does not mention 1903(f) and we suggest that the

12

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

The August

1

failure to mention 1903(f) in the clarification establishes

2

what we said in the initial moratorium intended, which was not

3

to cover 1903(f) either.

4

to broaden the moratorium with respect to some other issues and

5

they clearly did not include 1903(f) in these other issues that

6

were being clarified.

7

expressly says "1903(f) is not covered."

8

9

So the main purpose of Congress was

The Senate report has a sentence that

Now, what you may be referring to is a recent
enactment by the House, the so-called,

"Waxman Bill," which

10

does specifically state that the State of California will be

11

permitted to set its medically needy income level based â€” for

12

adult couples based on the AFDC level for a family of three.

13

So the Waxman Bill seems to be in a sense an attempt

14

by Congress to determine the outcome of this particular

15

litigation.

16

be entirely a matter of speculation as to what happened â€”

17

But that has not yet passed the Senate.

QUESTION:

It would

But as to the first of the two pieces of

18

legislation you mentioned in substance said that the moratorium

19

was intended to be broader than its language would indicate?

20

MR. MERRILL:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, and â€”

How does that -- I am not quite sure how

22

that enters the case.

I found it a little hard to follow the

23

moratorium all the way to the end.

Heritage

Well, everyone finds it hard to follow
What August did, this last

13
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

August, what Congress did this last August was it clarified the

2

1984 moratorium by saying that, "in addition to the subsection

3

of 1902(a) that we initially mentioned, the following three

4

subsections were also governed by the moratorium."

5

not mention 1903(f), as the original moratorium did not mention

6

1903(f).

7

of the proposition of the original moratorium did not have any

8

application to this case.

We just say that, we just cite this as confirmation

QUESTION:

9

They did

No, but at least it establishes the

10

proposition that the moratorium in the 1984 DEFRA statute is

11

broader than the one applicable just to 1902(a).
MR. MERRILL:

12

13

Yes, it does do that.

But the fact

that â€”

14

QUESTION:

If you just knew that much, you might

15

think,

16

point is that they broadened it with three specifics without

17

adding the fourth?

18

"well, maybe it also should apply to 1903(f)?"

MR. MERRILL:

That is correct.

But your

I mean, I do not

19

think â€” there is clearly a dispute going on between California

20

and HHS over whether or not the original DEFRA moratorium

21

applies to 1903(f).

22

least, were made aware of this dispute.

23

Congress clarified the DEFRA moratorium and in doing that it

24

did not state that the 1903(f) was covered by the moratorium.

25

Presumably some people in Congress, at
In August 1987,

We think that that is fairly conclusive evidence that

Heritage

14
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

neither the original moratorium nor the new moratorium were

2

intended to have anything to do with Section 1903(f).

3

QUESTION:

Or at least this Congress' interpretation

4

of the original moratorium, which is really not which governs

5

what the original moratorium meant.

6

MR. MERRILL:

Well, I think you can argue that in

7

this case it does, Justice Scalia, because as I mentioned,

8

Congress made the effective date of the clarification

9

retroactive to the date of the original moratorium.

Now, if

10

that is permissible, and we do not take any position on that,

11

the new legislation is in effect the governing law that would

12

apply throughout the period in controversy in this case.

13

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question about the

14

moratorium?

15

it, it lasted only until something like January 1986, or

16

whatever the date, but a date that has already passed.

17
18

I may have my notes mixed up, but as I understood

MR. MERRILL:

No.

The moratorium was to last for 18

months after the Secretary filed a report with Congress.

19

QUESTION:

Oh.

20

MR. MERRILL:

About the effect of having different

21

methodologies for measuring different income between medically

needy medicaid families and other types of medicaid families

The Secretary missed the

3

QUESTION:

So it is still in effect, whatever it is,

all right.

4

MR. MERRILL:

It is still in effect, that is correct.

5

In concluding, I would just like to emphasize what is

6

not at issue in this case:

7

power of states like California to afford a greater medicaid

8

benefits to adult couples.

9

benefits once they had been made available.

10

this case does not concern the

The issue is who to pay for such
Congress had given

the states broad discretion to set eligibility standards.

11

But Congress has also set a cap on federal financial

12

participation equal to 4/3rds of the highest level of benefits

13

paid to an AFDC family of the same size.

14

more federal dollars for the medically needy, it can increase

15

the size of its AFDC benefits, which would automatically,

16

through application of the statutory formula increase the size

17

of the federal cap.

If California wants

Alternatively, it can increase medicaid benefits for

18
19

adult couples and can arrange to pay for the excess benefits

20

above the federal cap itself.
What it cannot do under existing law is to file an

21
22

amended plan that violates the federal cap and insists that the

23

federal government reimburse it for amounts in excess of the

24

cap.

MR. JOHNSON:

The principal holding I think that you

are referring to, Justice Rehnguist, was the Ninth Circuit

giving legal force and effect to the ROM in the same status as

14

one would in a duly-promulgated regulation and/or statute.

Yes, we are taking a different view, as we indicated

in our briefs.

that determination in this Court.

as our view was, incidently, before the Ninth Circuit, and

before the Secretary in the administrative process, that this

Congress specifically reaffirmed that regulation, or that

Heritage

20
Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

policy interpretation, when it adopted the DEFRA moratorium,

2

because the issue that was before the Conference Committee was

3

made clear in the Conference Committee Report, and in â€” before

4

we refer to that Report we have to have -- in April 1983, HHS

5

had promulgated a policy letter to all regions, and that is at

6

Appendix B to our Brief in Opposition to the Petition.

7

In that letter, for the first time, HHS takes the

8

view that, in light of Congress' enactment of TEFRA and the

9

"single standard" requirement in TEFRA, that states could no

10

longer set adult couple income levels at 133.33 percent of the

11

grant for three, as provided in ROM-2572, and that letter

12

specifically states ROM-2572 because of the enactment of TEFRA

13

and the "single standard" requirement in TEFRA.

14

That "single standard" requirement is Section

15

1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(3).

16

referred to in the DEFRA moratorium.

17

That is the same section that is

And then when you refer to the Conference Committee

18

Report to determine what was the issue, what was the problem

19

that they thought they were addressing in adopting the

20

moratorium, the language that the Conference Committee used is

21

almost identical in addressing â€” in articulating, the issue

22

that is addressed in that 1983 all-regions letter.

23

When the Conference Committee says, "similarly, the

24

Department has taken the position," it is exactly that letter

25

that was sent out to all of the policy regions some few months

21

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

before that Congress was referring to and that Conference

2

Committee Report reiterates what the Secretary's position was

3

as it was stated, or I should say, the Department's position,

4

as it was stated in that all-regions policy letter, that in

5

light of Congress' enactment of the "single standard"

6

requirement in TEFRA, states could no longer set maintenance

7

need income levels for adult couples because that would result

8

in a different medically needy income level among groups of the

9

same family size, depending upon the relative numbers of adults

10

and children.
So it is almost the same language that was used by

11
12

the Department in their all-regions policy letter in April

13

1983.

14

restrictive interpretation of the TEFRA amendment and

15

prohibited denying the state plan amendments -- state plans,

16

and more recently, state plan amendments, making it clear based

17

on that overly-restrictive reading.

Congress then criticizes the Secretary's overly-

QUESTION:

18
19

Mr. Johnson, what did they intend the

states to be able to do?
MR. JOHNSON:

20

They intended, Mr. Justice, we believe,

21

by that very language referring right to the Secretary's ruling

22

of ROM â€” or reversing ROM-2572, to reaffirm the Department's

23

policy set out in ROM-2572.
QUESTION:

24
25

Were there some actual states that were

involved?

22

Heritage

Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

MR. JOHNSON:

There were two states, Justice White,

2

at that point in time, who were proposing to utilize the

3

criteria of ROM-2572:

ourselves and Nebraska.

4

Now, if there is any ambiguity â€” I am sorry?

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Well, did Congress know that?

That there

were two states doing it?
MR. JOHNSON:

We would have to make it as an

8

assumption, Mr. Justice, because I could say that the

9

legislative history does not specifically say they were aware

10

that California and that Nebraska was.

I can say, however,

11

that it is almost certain from the legislative history, because

12

the letter, the all-regions policy letter, that was sent out in

13

April 1983, which indeed there is no question that that is what

14

they were referring to, is in fact in response to an inquiry

15

concerning California's state plan amendment and that inquiry

16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

Somebody must have gotten to the

Conference Committee or to Congress.
MR. JOHNSON:

That is right.

The policy letter

20

itself is referring back to California's state plan amendment,

21

because the inquiry had come in from the Region Nine San

22

Francisco office.

23

But if there is any ambiguity in the Conference --

24

the Conferees' Report itself, that ambiguity it seems to me, is

25

completely resolved when you refer over to the House report in

Heritage

23
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

support of the House bill that came in to Conference. Because

2

the House report in support of that bill specifically says,

3

"HHS has reversed itself on the policy that it had contained in

4

2572."

5

reversal; it made clear that it is entirely logical that the

6

state could determine that it could cost an elderly couple more

7

to live per month than it would a single â€” a parent and one

8

child; and it said that the purpose of the House bill was,

9

indeed, to reinstate that policy.

It severely criticized HHS for making that policy

It does not necessarily prove

With respect, Mr. Justice, I would

disagree, because I think it is very important and entirely

2

appropriate to refer.to when you are looking to see what was

3

the issue that was before the Conference Committee.

4

the Senate bill had no provisions in it concerning adult couple

5

income levels.

6

since that issue was framed by the House bill, it seems that it

7

is entirely appropriate to look at what the House report was as

8

to what that issue was.

9
10

Because

That issue was framed by the House bill.

QUESTION:

And

So instead of amending, they did the

MR. JOHNSON:

12

Bear in mind that the moratorium amends no statute;

13

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

provides no permanent solutions; what it does --

14

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- is the inference not,

15

though, that the Conference Committee â€” thought that the

16

statute, that the Secretary was properly construing the

17

statute?

18

MR. JOHNSON:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Well, in revoking ROM, the Secretary was

20

properly construing the statute?

21

MR. JOHNSON:

22

No, Mr. Justice, I think it is the

other way around.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. JOHNSON:

25

Yes, sir.

You do?
I think that in reaffirming the policy

set out in ROM, they were determining that the Secretary, or I

Heritage

25
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

should say HHS, had made a proper policy interpretation under

2

1903(f), and that that policy should be reinstated:

3

says that "the Secretary will prescribe standards for â€”

4

prescribe the standards that are equivalent to 133.33 percent."

5

It is not a flat â€” it gives the Secretary a great deal of

6

discretion in determining what is equivalent and in the manner

7

in prescribing what those standards are.
We think that that policy interpretation was entirely

8

9

proper.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JOHNSON:

12

1903(f)

When would the moratorium end?
If in fact the Report was filed in

September, it would end 18 months after.

13

QUESTION:

What report?

14

MR. JOHNSON:

The moratorium required HHS, or the

15

Secretary, to file a report with Congress in which it would

16

discuss the entire broad range of medicaid eligibility â€”

17

QUESTION:

If the Conference Committee thought the

18

Secretary was properly construing the statute, under -- when he

19

had the issue drawn â€” and not properly construing it when he

20

had revoked it, why would the moratorium ever end?

21

MR. JOHNSON:

But for the fact that Congress has in

22

fact said it will end, Mr. Justice, I think you would be

23

absolutely right.

24

when they enacted that in 1982, was to re-establish all the

25

medicaid eligibility rules that existed prior to 1981, when the

Once you -- the whole purpose behind TEFRA,

Heritage

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was enacted.

2

Congress decided in the moratorium to only have those more-

flexible rules that applied before OBRA, in effect for 18

4

months -- indeed they would have -- that would have continued

5

to be extant law in light of TEFRA.

6

QUESTION:

Had not

I took Justice White's question to suggest

7

that if Congress had really agreed with ROM it would not have

8

said "you cannot do anything for eight months, or 18 months."

9

It would have said, "you cannot ever do anything."

10

QUESTION:

Which is what the House proposed.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MR. JOHNSON:

In enacting the moratorium by virtue of

13

having â€” well, I think what the Congress is doing â€” as it

14

said in the Conference Committee report, that they wanted these

15

more flexible rules re-established as they existed prior to

16

1981, and they were going to be studying the matter further

17

during that period of 18 months.

18

well within its powers of putting on that 18-month limitation,

19

but by virtue of saying that, "we are at the end of 18 months,

20

either we are going to legislate further," that in fact they

21

did not mean to re-establish the medicaid eligibility policies

22

that existed prior to OBRA would require us to disregard what

23

they had said when they enacted TEFRA.

24
25

QUESTION:

I think that Congress was

It sounds like Congress was saying, "we

want to get a report from the Secretary," and it sounds like

Heritage

27
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

they are indicating that the statute, the Secretary could

2

construe the statute either way.

3

MR. JOHNSON:

4

Mr. Justice, I think what Congress is

really telling us in the moratorium --

5

QUESTION:

At least they are saying that.

6

MR. JOHNSON:

They are saying that.

But I do not

7

know that they are saying they can construe it either way.

8

think they are saying they want a report from the Secretary.

I

9

But when you look at the Conference Committee Report

10

and when you look at the House Report in support of the recent

11

clarification of the moratorium, it becomes clear, and in fact

12

the House even says that "the legislative history of this

13

moratorium," and grant you it is a subject even broader than

14

adult couple income levels, "the legislative history of this

15

moratorium dates back to the enactment by Congress of OBRA in

16

1981."

17

purported to give states greater flexibility in its medicaid

18

eligibility rules, that the Department has been misinterpreting

19

what Congress' intents were in enacting first OBRA and, as a

20

result of the Secretary's proposed regulations to implement

21

OBRA, as this Court recognized last Term in Adkins v. Rivera,

22

that interpretation was immediately rejected and that led to

23

the single-standard requirement in TEFRA.

24
25

Because it was after that statute that on its face

I think that DEFRA is further indication -- as it
says -- is the Secretary's misinterpretation of the

Heritage

28
Reporting Corporation
(202) 628-4888

1

requirements under TEFRA.

2

they have now â€” this moratorium must be viewed in light of

3

that history.

4

"for the next 18 months, Mr. Secretary, get it right.

5

are going to make sure you get it right because we are going to

6

have this moratorium clearly and specifically having all the

7

pre-OBRA eligibility standards in effect, and at the end of

8

that 18 months, we may very well change our minds and rewrite

9

it all, but for the next 18 months we want to make sure you get

10

adult couple income level.
QUESTION:

Do you think this was really an 18 â€” it

was an amendment of the statute that would last for 18 months?
MR. JOHNSON:

15
16

And we

And in our view, this concerns the income -- the

So, Justice White, when we say that

Mr. Justice, this does not amend any

statute.

17

QUESTION:

I do not know, but it has that effect.

18

MR. JOHNSON:

The effect that it is intended to have,

as Congress said when it enacted TEFRA, and what is essentially

be reiterated here, is to re-establish the eligibility rules

20

That is the only

They thought it was right and you want to

change it.
MR. JOHNSON:

Well, it is additional legislative

21

history, Mr. Justice, but it seems it would be appropriate when

22

you have no provision coming from the Senate on this adult

23

couple income levels, and that issue was framed by a bill that

24

comes from House and from Conference Committee.

25

We think the Conference Committee's statements itself

30

Heritage

Reporting

Corporation

(202) 628-4888

1

are abundantly clear as to what it wanted done.

2

it is given additional clarity by reference over to the House

3

Report, because the House Report only dealt with this one

4

specific issue and was longer and more explanatory.

5

But it seems,

But we think standing on its own the Conference

6

Committee Report itself makes clear that they wanted -- they

7

were reversing the Department's reversal of its policy set out

8

in ROM-2572.

9

Now, the second reason that we think that the

10

moratorium authorizes California to set its income levels at

11

133.33 percent of the grant for three is that the Secretary's

12

interpretation would require not only disregarding the intent

13

of the Conference Committee as it is set out in the Conference

14

Committee Report issue now -- yes, Sir?

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Now, before you -- I take it â€” well, you

go ahead, you go ahead.
MR. JOHNSON:

It would not only require the Court,

18

then, to disregard what we think is the very clear intent of

19

the Conference Committee as set out in their Report, but would

20

also require you to disregard congressional rejection of just

21

the interpretation that they are urging upon you.

22

is the Secretary's view that all of the moratorium, as concerns

23

adult couple income levels authorizes, is the setting of an

24

adult couple income level at 133.33 percent of the grant -- the

25

AFDC grant, for two.

Because it

that kind of flexibility that Congress specifically rejected in

4

It is just that interpretation and giving states

In September 1981, in reaction to the adoption of

Because AFDC cash grants are traditionally

20

seems to me that if that is what it had been to accomplish by

21

this moratorium, and Congress, would have said,

22

reversing our own selves of what we had said just less than two

23

years before when we enacted TEFRA."

24
25

And that, it

"we are

To the contrary, Congress is saying in its enacting
the moratorium, "states are to be given the flexibility of

using less restrictive eligibility criteria, and in the case of

2

adult couple income levels, to set that medically-needy income

3

level at 133.33 percent of the AFDC grant for three," because

4

that is what was authorized in ROM-2572 and we believe they

5

reaffirmed that policy in the moratorium.
Had they meant to reject their own determination in

6

7

TEFRA, they certainly would have said so, particularly in a

8

moratorium, which I think we can all agree, is at least

9

abundantly clear in the fact that it wants to give the states

10

greater and more flexibility to use less restrictive â€” which

11

means higher -- income standards.
We think, in conclusion, that looking at the issue

12

13

that was before the Conference Committee, that issue was HHS's

14

rejection â€” or reversal, of its own policy set out in ROM-

15

2572, and in looking at the ramifications of what the

16

Secretary's position is, that we think it is quite clear that

MR. MERRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I promise

not to take 12 minutes:
The Secretary's position in this case is clear and
straightforward.

Section 1903(f) of the Social Security Act

10

specifically sets a cap on federal financial participation

11

based on the AFDC benefits levels of families of the same size

12

as those in the medically-needy group.

13

construed the language, "same size" to mean that "adult

14

couples" is a "family of two," and that a "family of two"

15

cannot be the same size as a AFDC family of "three."

The Secretary has

May I interrupt you there?
Sure.

Would you agree that, If ROM-whatever the

19

number there is, were a correct statement of the law, and I

know you disagree, that it would be permissible to treat an

21

adult and two children as equal to two adults?

22

I should say, that two adults is equal to â€” the language

"between" is what you argued about before.

I do not think you

Justice Stevens, we hope that this case

does not come down to the issue of whether the language of ROM

says, "between one and three," can be stretched to include

"three."

ROM itself did not permit what California was doing because

"between one and three" means "one dollar less than three."

Our position, I think, is relatively straightforward;

the position that the Respondents take is very hard to follow.

Essentially California has put forward three statements of fact

None of these are by themselves are

But they are radically incomplete.

First, California stated that, in 1983 an official of

Second, that it â€”

Third, California states that the Conference

Committee opposed a moratorium on TEFRA.

4

Now, there are tremendous gaps in this presentation,

5

and when the gaps are filled in, the persuasiveness of the

6

argument completely disappears.

7

Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration

8

consistently stated that the California proposal violated

9

Section 1903(f) and the Secretary's implementing regulations.

First of all, the

10

It is true that there were certain expressions of opinion that

11

the California plan also violated TEFRA, but the Secretary â€”

12

the Administrator, ultimately did not rely on the violation of

13

TEFRA; the Administrator relied on the violation of Section

14

1903(f).

15

Secondly, although the House passed a bill which

16

disapproved the Secretary's repudiation of the ROM, the House

17

bill was never enacted into law.

18

Conference Report, which is reproduced in our brief on pages 44

19

and 45, is quite explicit: it describes the present law as

20

being the cap set by Section 1903(f); it states that the House

21

bill permits the states to establish medically-needy levels for

22

families of two adults up to the 133.33 percent of the three-

23

person AFDC standard; it says that the Senate had no provision,

24

and describes the Conference Agreement as follows:

Conference Agreement does not include the House provision."

on the reason why the Secretary rejected the ROM?

To be absolutely precise, Justice

18

Stevens, the Administrator found that the California plan

19

violated Section 1903(f), and for that reason the plan was in

20

violation of Section 1902(a)(4) and (a)(19).

The TEFRA provision, which was moratoriumed by DEFRA,

Yes.

But if, in fact, the

Secretary thought it violated both the provisions, and I would

25

suppose that the Secretary did think it violated both

provisions, then does not the language of the moratorium, at

2

least arguably, read on that?
MR. MERRILL:

Some Agency employees offered the

opinion that â€”
QUESTION:

5

Would not the government's position today

be that it violated the "single-standard" requirement of

(a)(10)(C)(i)(3)?

MR. MERRILL:

8

If there were no moratorium on the

9

Secretary disapproving state plans for that reason, yes, it

10

would be our position that it violates that, quite clearly.

11

But DEFRA had been enacted by the time the

12

Administrator had reached her final decision in this case, and

13

in the final decision of the Administrator there was no

14

reliance whatsoever on TEFRA or the "single-standard"

15

provision.

The sole reliance was based on 1903(f).

16

The other argument that is put forward in several

17

different versions by California is that, somehow, what the

18

Secretary is doing in this case violates the provision of

19

TEFRA, which stated that the Secretary was to go back to pre-

20

OBRA regulations.

21

Because, the DEFRA moratorium as it has been discussed, puts a

22

moratorium on TEFRA, and I do not understand how a statute that

23

puts a moratorium on TEFRA can then be transposed into a

24

statement that somehow, a provision of TEFRA has to be

25

governing in this particular case?

The logic of this completely escapes me.

Heritage

1

In any event, even if we do go back to the pre-OBRA

2

regulations, the pre-OBRA regulations are 42 C.F.R. 435.1007,

3

which has been in effect in the current form since 1971, and

4

which is the regulation which the Secretary relied upon in this

5

case in disapproving California's state plan.

6

The ROM is not a regulation.

The ROM is a statement

7

that appears in an internal Agency manual; it has none of the

8

indicia of a valid regulation, and has never been regarded as a

9

regulation.
