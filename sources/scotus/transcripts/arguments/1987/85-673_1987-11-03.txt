this case in the regulation of these areas, as to what are the

boundaries that their statutes must stay within.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

17

MS.

CONNELL:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Mr.

Hartigan has not met his burden of establishing

20

either obligatory or discretionary jurisdiction to review the

21

issues he now raises nor has he satisfied the burden of showing

22

that the Illinois statute is carefully enough drawn to achieve

23

a significant state interest without burdening the exercise of

fundamental right.

the

the

the Act's

10

The reason the 7th Circuit reserved the issue of the

11

Act's constitutionality was because the 7th Circuit found that

12

the statute by its own terms was incomplete. It was incomplete

13

because the statute specifically sets out a desire by the

14

Illinois General Assembly for a judicial by-pass for any young

15

woman who cannot tell either both of her parents or one of her

16

parents about her pregnancy and her desire to have an abortion.

17

Now,

this

incomplete statutory scheme is really at

18

the root of the jurisdictional efficiency that we have here.

19

The statute itself in Sections 5(f) and 5(g) specifically say

20

that a confidential and expedited appeal shall be available as

21

the Illinois Supreme Court provides by rule.

22

In the next provision of the statute,

the General

23

Assembly respectfully requests the Illinois Supreme Court to

24

promulgate any rules necessary.

25

Mr. Hartigan's counsel misstates the statute when he
