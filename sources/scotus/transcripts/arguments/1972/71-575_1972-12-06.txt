MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

in 71-575, Gomes against Peres,
Mr. Wright, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY D. WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WRIGHT;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When Linda Gomez met Francisco Perez in 1968, I
submit that she at that time did not consciously think that
she could have a child and hopefully get. support for an
illegitimate child.

The law of the State of Texas, of course,

at that time and, of course, to now has been construed to
provide squarely to the contrary.
I wish to begin by reciting from a Texas case,
Beaver v. State, which I think illustrates the attitude of
the Texas courts and therefore the present Texas law on the
subject of illegitimacy.

When the word "child" or "children"

is used in a statute, unless the statute clearly reflects to
the contrary, it means a legitimate child or children only.
While there is some conflict of authorities upon the meaning
of the word "child" when used in a statute, deed, or will,
the decided weight of authority is in favor of the construction
that, the use of such word refers alone to legitimate children.
The Texas court —

4
QUESTION:

I am not sure I follow your point on that.

Is this true in virtually all the States?
MR. WRIGHT:
States.

Yes,, your Honor, it is true in most

The difference is that in most States, the statutes

of the States have provided for support for illegitimate
children, have also provided for inheritance by illegitimate
children.

And, of course, the statutes under attack in the

cases Levy v. Louisiana, Glona, and Weber all dealt with
statutes which precluded support for illegitimate children.
My purpose in reading that cite, of course, was
only to succinctly state the Texas law on the subject of
illegitimacy.

I did not intend to recite that for any unique

proposition of law.

That particular cite does give, I think,

the best illustration of the status of illegitimates in Texas.
The Texas courts have taken that attitude for reasons
which are not to me clear.

Apparently, and in the lower court

opinion in this case, the primary consideration of the courts
has been that to determine paternity would require very
stringent evidence problems for which the courts are not
adequate to deal with at this point.

The courts have asked

that legislation be passed in order to provide proper safe­
guards to determine paternity rather than use the common law
rules of evidence.
In dealing with this subject, I submit that problems
of proof such as the issue of paternity in the State of Texas

5
first, of all should not be a valid consideration in refusing
to determine constitutional rights.
Secondly,, I submit that, the problems of proof
which the courts refused to deal with in determining paternity
for purposes of support for illegitimates in the State of
Texas are problems of proof that the courts in the State of
Texas have dealt with and are dealing with today and will
continue to deal with.

Therefor®, the refusal to meet these

problems of proof for purposes of support for illegitimates
is an invidious discrimination.
An example of the situations in which this area,
this problems of proof area, is dealt with daily by the
Texas courts can be found in the cases of James v. James,
253 SW .1112, in which the Court found not only paternity, but
also found legitimation of the child.

Therefore, the child

did inherit part of the paternal grandparents' estate.
The case of Robinson v. Seales, 1923 Civil Appeals
opinion, as was the case of James v, James, found at 242 SW 754
was another case dealing with the legitimation of a child
pursuant to what is now Section 42 of the Probate Code.

Again

in that case the Court dealt i\dfch the issue of paternity,
resolved the issue of paternity, dealt with and resolved the
issue of legitimation in favor of the child.

And again the

cbild participated in the distribution of an estate.
Ray v. Thompson is another case dealing with real

property in which again the issue of paternity was met and
resolved by the Court..

In that case at page 196 of 261 S.W.2d,

it was a 1953 case, in the actual opinion of the Court of Civil
Appeals it states that the lower court's findings of fact was,
one, that Lula

Mitchell Thompson was the daughter of General

Mitchell. Again, we have a Texas court confronted with and
<
dealing with and resolving the issue of paternity of a child.
I do not therefore believe that the problems of proof argument,
is a rational relationship to justify the State's present
policy in not dealing with and allowing for support for
illegitimates.
I could give many other cites on that subject.

I

do have many other cites in my brief on that subject to
illustrate the fact that the courts, by saying that the
problems of proof are too great are incorrect and are incon­
sistent with their own policies and their own decisions daily»
The problems of proof argument does have one other
aspect which I would like to deal with, and that is under
present Texas law if Linda Gomez had asserted a common law
marriage relationship, if we could have in the lower courts
stated that the necessary intent existed on her part to
create the common law marriage relationship, then in spit© of
the fact that Francisco Peres was a married man, we would
have been able to claim a putative relationship and under
Texas law we would have been able to have a judicial declaration

that that putative relationship existedj we would have
therefore had a legitimate child and we would have been able
to obtain support.
If we had taken that approach, the problems of proof
which the Court would have faced would have not only been the
issue of paternity itself and whether or not support should be
allowed, the Court would also have been required to deal with
the intent of Linda Gomez, another very serious and another
very stringent determination on their part.
Therefore, I am saying merely that in the problems
of proof area, what we are asking the Court to do in allowing
for support for illegitimates is not something which would b@
a severe burden on the courts, not something which would be a
greater burden on the courts than the burdens which these
courts face daily on the very

subject that we are dealing

with today.
Section 42 of the Probate Code which I mentioned
deals with legitimation of a child.

It's the only statute in

the State of Texas dealing with legitimation and allows for
legitimacy of a child if the parents of that child subsequent
to the birth of the child marry.

In that situation there is

no presumption of legitimacy such as we have in the ceremonial
marriage or the common law marriage in which a child is born
subsequent to the creation of the marriage.

Without, the

benefit of the presumption in any divorce action, the courts

8

where Section 42 of the Probate Code comes into play are
required to deal with the issue of paternity and resolve it
and also resolve issues of support.
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

{Inaudible)
Yes.
Therefore, ...involve the constitutionality

of the State statute whose constitutionality your State Court
has upheld.

That would provide jurisdiction for appeal.

MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And yet I understand that at the time

you brought this lawsuit, that statute was not in effect, and
I can't find anywhere in the opinion or dissenting opinion of
the Texas Court where the statute was even mentioned.
MR. WRIGHT:
rather than writ

The jurisdictional basis for an appeal

of certiorari, I believe, is found in

Article I of the Texas Civil Statutes.
adoption of the common law.

Article I is a statutory

Admittedly, it is the common law

principle that we are facing each day.
QUESTION:

It is dealing here with Texas common law

which says that the mother of an illegitimate child cannot
collect money from the putative father of the child.

Is that

it?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct.
Common law.
That's correct.

I do believe Article I

9
is a sufficient statutory basis —
QUESTION^

Well, that, would give sufficient

statutory basis, I suppose than, to make any decision of your
courts appealable as of right.
MR. WRIGHT;
QUESTION;
MR. WRIGHT;
QUESTION:

Yes.
Wouldn’t it?
That's correct.
Bo you think that statute goes that far

to make every decision of the Texas courts involving State
common law appealable as a right here by contrast to the other
49 States where you have to petition for certiorari?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION;
MR. WRIGHT:

I, of course —•
That makes Texas a very special State.
I, of course, could not argue for such

a construction.
QUESTION;

That's the thrust of your argument..

That's

where it leads, isn't it?
MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct. 4.02, which was not in

existence at the time, did have, of course, predecessors.
4.02 of the Family Code was part of a comprehensive code which
became effective in January 1970.

Prior to that there were

various civil statutes on the subject of marriage, on the
subject of divorce, and, of course, on the subject of child
support.
If this Court were to consider there be jurisdictional

10
problems in this matter, X would submit that pursuant to
28 U.SoC. 2101 that if in fact we should not, have brought our
case to this Court by means of appeal, that that issue alone
is not sufficient for the Court to refuse to hear and decide
this action and that Section 2101 will allow for tills Court
to treat the direct appeal approach as a writ of certiorari.
QUESTION?

(Inaudible)

writ research, then we

would still be in a position to deal with it, not pro temp
as though w© had it before us initially, would we not?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

In the case

of Edward Garrifcy v. State of New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, I
believe, there is a good illustration of the fact that the
Court at any time can treat the appeal as a writ of certiorari,
dismiss the appeal, assume

the writ of certiorari and go to

the merits of the case and determine them.
QUESTION:

Your basic claim is an equal protection

claim, twofold, is it not?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:
with that claim?

Yes, Mr. Justice.
Do you understand that your Court dealt

In their opinion they seem to just simply

be dealing with the fact that the common law of Texas did not
allow recovery

by

the mother of an illegitimate child from

the putative father of that child without any consideration
at all as to what, if any, ware the rights of the mother of a
legitimate child to recover from the father.

MR. WRIGHT:

The Court of Civil Appeals in this

case did, of course; have a very brief opinion, with the
exception, of course, of the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice
Cadena, and we, of course, did assert and it can be shown by
the record, we did assert in the appeal, in the Motion for
Rehearing and the Application for Writ of Error to the Texas
Supreme Court, we did assert our equal protection argument.
The fact that the Court of Civil Appeals refused to discuss
the argument in its opinion, I do not believe can be
considered .to be a refusal by the Court to hear the case.
i

QUESTION: ‘ You did raise it in the trial court,
did you?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

It was raised in the trial court.
Was it taken to the trial court in Texas

in your initial submission or only on rehearing?
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Justice, it was taken to the

Fourth Court of Civil Appeals which granted a — or which
rendered a 2-page opinion, the minority opinion.

in.

The

It was decided —

opinion in the jurisdic­

tional statement where that opinion appears, they certainly
do treat it, say you have made the contention, although they
don't deal with it.
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

They do state on

12
page 41 of that opinion, "Appellant asserts that such
judgment denying such child the support of her father constitutes
a denial of equal protection of law under the Fourteenth.
Amendment of the United States Constitution."

That opinion

can be found —
QUESTION:

On this point, are you asking to hold

the Texas statute unconstitutional?
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Justice, that issue was presented

in the responsive brief in this matter, and I do not assert
that the statute itself, 4.02 of the Family Code, should be
declared unconstitutional.
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

When was that effective?
4.02 was effective on the 1st of

January 1970.
The Court of Civil Appeals decided the case March 10,
1971.
QUESTION:

4.02 was the law of Texas at the time

the Court of Appeals acted.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

At the time the Court of Appeals acted.
And wouldn't you suppose that the case

would be decided in accordance with the then existing law?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
That is, Section 4.02 was construed not

to extend liability to the putative father in this case.
MR. WRIGHT:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

13

QUESTION;

You brought your lawsuit on September 18,

1969, before the effective date of the statute»
MR» WRIGHT;
QUESTION:

Yes.
The statute, so far as I can find, wasn’t

mentioned in the ferial court or the appellate ciourfe and it
was not in existence at the time you brought your, lawsuit.
QUESTION:

But it was in existence when the

appellate court made its decision?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.
Did you even mention the statute there,

4.02?
MR. WRIGHT:
Justice.

In the appellate court.

Yes, Mr.

The brief in the Court of Civil Appeals, Fourth

Court of Civil Appeals, did mention the statute as I recall.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. WRIGHT:

mentioned.

In the majority opinion, that is

correct, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

The Court dealt with the common law of

Texas that held that —
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.
It didn't contrast what the rights be of

a legitimate mother against the father of a legitimate child,
if any.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
You did, you say, cite 4.02 in your

14
brief to the appellate court.?
MR. WRIGHT:

As I recall, 4.02 was mentioned in

the merit brief.
QUESTION:

In the opinion is a sentence, "At the

present time there is no Texas statute imposing on the father
the duty to support and maintain an illegitimate child„"
Now, since 4.02 at the present time was on the books, can we
take it that that is an interpretation of 4.02?
■{*R. WRIGHT:

Yes, fir. Justice, it's either an

interpretation of — well, it obviously is
of 4.02 contrary to our assertions.

an interpretation

We asserted that 4.02

could apply to the illegitimate.
QUESTION:

That's why you sav that 4.02 as construed

is unconstitutional?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

However, if we were

in fear that a ruling on 4.02 would of necessity require
striking down 4.02 as totally unconstitutional thereby relieving
all fathers of support obligations, then I submit that we
could treat, this matter as a writ of certiorari and decide
the common law of Texas and leave 4.02 in existence.
QUESTION:

But for constitutional purposes under the

Fourteenth Amendment, it doesn't make any difference whether
the Texas rights are given or denied by statute or by common
law, does it?
MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

I believe

15
that: the case of Shelley v. Kraemer is a very good example of
the ability of the court, and -the jurisdiction of a court to
deal strictly with common law issues.
QUESTION:

I don’t think you can successfully main­

tain that even though the statute of Texas may satisfy equal
protection, nonetheless wo just want the common law analysed,
and if that doesn't satisfy equal protection, strike that
down.

I think you have got to take the statute and common

law together for purposes of your equal protection claim,
don't you?
MR. WRIGHT:

It was not my opinion that we would

necessarily have to take both together.

We, of course, also

in the State of Texas have 602 •—
QUESTION:

If you had accepted the construction of

4.02 to the effect that 4„02 simply doesn't reach the duties
of an unwed father, it deals only with spouses and married
people, and you have to look elsewhere for the duty, if any,
of an unwed father, if that's the position, then you are then
dealing with some non-statutory law of Texas, as Mr. Justice
Stewart says.
MR. WRIGHT:

As is illustrated by the mother's

liability in the State of Texas for support of illegitimates QUESTION:

Under what law or statute?

know she had any liability?

How do we

Or how, indeed, do we know that

the father of a legitimate child had any liability prior to

16
the enactment of 4.02?
MR. WRIGHT:

The case of

Galveston Railway v.

Walker, I believe, is cited for the proposition that the
mothers of illegitimates do have liability for support of
those children.

They may be sued for necessaries, of course.

Yet this exists outside 4.02 of the Family Code and outside
602 of the Penal Code.
Then it seems that any obligation on the part of a
father of an illegitimate could as easily and'as well exist,
outside.
QUESTION:

If the father of an illegitimate child

had custody of the child, could he sue the mother for the
child’s support?

That's the left side of this coin.

MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

That's my interpretation of the law.
There is no court decision interpreting

the law?
MR. WRIGHT:

Thera are no decisions I am aware of.

Of course, this may be due to the fact that the father of an
illegitimate was always considered not to have any rights.
The case of Stanley v. Illinois, I believe, does change that
in the State of Texas, and I do believe pursuant to that case
that the father of an illegitimate may have custodial
privileges now in the State of Texas.
This again presents another problem pursuant to
Texas law which I have dealt with in the brief.

If the

17
father of an illegitimate does have custodial rights to that
child, Article 2330 of the Texas Civil Statutes is the article
whereby the State or an, individual party can terminate
parental privileges.

The basis for that would be abandonment

or, in the alternative, nonsupport of that child.

If a

father of an illegitimate does have custody of that child and
at the same time does not, under Texas law, have any obligation
to support that child, then in the State of Texas we are
going to have fathers xvith custodial rights not subject to
termination for failing to provide adequate support for the
children.

If the Texas courts are not willing to accept such

a gross result, then I believe the Texas courts under the
present law will not, as a matter of course, blanketly grant
support Obligations on behalf of illegitimates running to the
father.

What they may do is simply state that the father of

an illegitimate with custody does have the obligation of
support and thereby parental privileges can be terminated
pursuant to 2330.

This, of course, would be a totally

irrational relationship.

The State would have no sound basis

for saying that only those fathers with custody should have
obligations of support.
I briefly want to mention that the responsive
briefs filed state that the State and the respondent state
that there is no insurmountable barrier in the State of Texas
for support for illegitimates, and they state that a child

18

whose parents afterward marry or whose parents had or have had
a common law marriage therefore can require support from the
father for the child.

Of course, that is not the category

of children that we are dealing with today.

The legitimation

statute, Section 42 of the Probate Code is the statute referred
to in the fact that the parties may aftoward marry.

The

common law marriage can be created.
But in both of these situations the children we are
dealing with there and the children who can get Support, from
fathers are not illegitimate children, such as the appellant
in this case.
I briefly would like to state that this Court can
determine this issue in our favor regardless of the equal
protection test used, whether it be a rational relationship
test or a compelling interest test.

The rational relationship

test, I believe, is satisfied in our case simply by the
classification itself.
QUESTION:

It says each spouse has the duty.

And I suppose if

two people are not married, then they are not spouses, neither
th© mother nor the father.
MR. WRIGHT:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice.

The

classification is, of course, contained in the case law in
tiie State of Texas.

Any statutory —

19

QUESTION:

You just told me there is no case -that

says that a father who has custody of an illegitimate child
can collect support from the mother.

And until and unless

that were the case law of Texas, you wouldn’t have any equal
protection claim, would you?
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I believe — I

thought that I had explained the absence of any cases to that
effect.

I do believe that would be the law in the State of

Texas.

*•

QUESTION:

It might be some day, but we don’t sit

here to deal with speculative questions like that.
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Inasmuch as the

fathers have never had custodial rights to begin with in the
State of Texas —
QUESTION:

The person with custody of a child h$s

the obligation of support, man, woman, or great aunt.
MR. WRIGHT:

This should be the Texas law.

I assume'

when that is confronted by a Texas court, that will be the
decision.

But taking the present Texas law and taking the

case of Stanley v. Illinois and taking Article 2330 of the
Civil Statutes and combining them, I would say that it is
entirely possible for the father of an illegitimate to have
custodial rights and not legally have the support burden, a
totally inconsistent result.
QUESTION:

So what happens in Texas is that law

20

evolves in the future.

That’s what you are telling us, isn't

it?
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:
MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.
We would have to guess.
But the classification by the case law

of legitimate children and illegitimate children alone in
determining support obligations is, of course, the primary
classification we are attacking.

There is no rational relation

ship between the needs of the child and the fact that the
parents of that child chose not to perform a marriage
ceremony,not even formulate the necessary intent to create a
marriage.

The parties may be guilty of wrongdoing, but I

do not see how the courts in the State of Texas can say the
illegitimates themselves are guilty of any wrongdoing.
QUESTION:

In this very case, the illegitimate child

is denied a support order against the father.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

13 that right?

That's correct, Mr. Justice.
And what you are complaining is by

official rule, that's the rule in Texas.
MR. WRIGHT:
QUESTION:

In effect, that’s correct, Mr. Justice.
Whereas, whether under 4.02 or whatever

itvmay be, had this child been a legitimate child of the
father, she would have gotten an order for support.

MR. WRIGHT:

This is the discrimination we are

attacking.
QUESTION:

We don’t have to knock 4.02 down.

was illegitimate, she is not getting a support order that,

And to be honest, T.

I did not take part in preparation of the

jurisdictional statement, and accordingly did not wish to
delete anything at the brief on the merits.

And I do hope

the Court will consider, if necessary, the possibility of
treating this matter as having come up on a writ, determine
the merits of the matter whether it be — well, of necessity
it would be the common law — determine the merits of the
matter in our favor.
QUESTION: where do you say we can find the law of
Texas that was just described by my brother Brennan which
says that a child has the right of action against a
legitimate father for support?

QUESTION;

As my brother Brennan

just put your case

to you, it was based upon the proposition that a legitimate

what the court in this case held.

Where can I find that in the Texas lav/?

MR. WRIGHT:

The case of Kaska v. Home of Holy

Infancy is the latest statement by the Texas Supreme Court
on the subject of support.

The decision was rendered in 1965,

and that case contains a brief review of the Texas case law on
the subject.
QUESTION:
MR.WRIGHT:

397 S.W. 2d.
Yes, Mr. Justice.

At page 210 the

Court states, referring to the fact that some States allow

23
custodial privileges on the part of fathers of illegitimates.
There are no similar statutes in Ter.as .

And here a father

is not under a coramon law or statutory duty to support his
illegitimate child.

The Court in this case found the child

to in fact be a legitimate child and the Court in this case
did grant custody of the child to the father.

The case did

not deal directly with the question of support from the father
of a legitimate child.

That is a proposition of Texas law

that, although it can be found in an abundance of cases, I am
not sure I have a case with me on that point.

I will perhaps

improperly assume that that proposition —
QUESTION:
have to enact

If that law isn't clear, why did they

the statute 4.02?

MR. WRIGHT:

The statute 4.02 is part of a

comprehensive reorganization of the laws of divorce in the
State of Texas, a codification and a centralization of all
those laws.

At that time the State of Texas through the

legislature first passed the no-fault divorce concept and
pursuant to that codification, of course, 4.02 came about,
which was a restatement of the Texas law of support liability
of fathers toward children.
» 602 of the Penal Code also exists.

And 602 of the

Penal Code states the obligation of support in terms of
parents, not in terms of spouses.
Mr, Justice, I apologize.

I just saw the coding.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH JAWORSKI, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. JAWORSKI;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

th© Court;
QUESTION;

May I ask you, please, Mr. Jawcrski,

were this a legitimate child of the appellee, would she be
administered a support order?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

Under what?

MR. JAWORSKI;

4.02?

Yes, sir.

I will deviate from my prepared argument for a
moment to answer, if the Court please, some of th© questions
that were propounded to counsel.

In all fairness, and

because I am appearing in the capacity I am today, I feel
it encumbent to make some of the remarks that I am going to
make right now.
First, the statute itself, that is 4.02, applies
only to spouses, and by interpretation you can strain that
argument, that interpretation,to mean it only applies to
legitimate children.
QUESTION;

Would it be correct to read the opinion of

the majority on page 19, third full paragraph,as though it
read "At the present time

we

do

not read Section 4.02

as imposing on the father any duty," and so forth?

25
MR. JAWORSKI:

In all fairness, I would say, yes.

That was the nest point I was going to make, your Honor.
QUESTION:

It's rather odd that since this was the

fulcrum of the argument that no one in either opinion mentioned
the statute.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

X have to agree, your Honor.

When the original case was brought, it

was not based in any way on the statute and could not have
been because the statute was not than in existence.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The issues therefore, in this lawsuit

were not framed and could not possibly have been framed in
terms of the statute.

Isn’t that correct?

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

I must agree, the statute was —

What, is the normal rule in litigation

when the law changes

when a case is on appeal?

What is the

law that applies?
MR. JAWORSKI:
to make, your Honor.

That was the third point I was going

That is that in Texas, ray understanding

is that the law that is in force at the time that the opinion
is rendered would be the applicable law.

So in all fairness,

I would make the same analysis that the Chief Justice made
in respect of the opinion.
To answer the question of the Court on the other
hand, 4.02 was not mentioned in any of the briefs.

26

QUESTION:

In the appellate court?

MR. JAWORSKI:

That is correct, before the Court of

Civil Appeals or in the Supreme Court on the Application
for Writ of Error.

At least the review that I have just

made of the briefs —
QUESTION:

Well, you know, it has happened in this

Court many times when a State law has changed between the;
time of the decision and our consideration, we vacate and
remand to consider a new Stats statute or something.

Do you

think that the Texas court had tills statute in mind at all,
decided this case with 4.02 in mind?
MR. JAWORSKI:

or do you know?

I do not know, but I would answer

that question affirmatively.
QUESTION:

What would you suggest — let's assume

4.02 had been passed last week and this case had been
decided the way it was without any reference to 4.02 because
it wasn't in existence.

4.02 was passed last week and then

this argument in this case comes today.
MR. JAWORSKI:

What would we do?

Mr. Justice, I would suggest that it

be remanded for a new trial at that point.
QUESTION:
Court, of Appeals.

You mean for reconsent

to the Texas

Let them decide what to do with it

themselves.
MR. JAWORSKI:

To the Texas Court of Appeals or

even further than that to the trial court.

27
QUESTION;

It would be up to them, though.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Simply vacate the appellate court

judgment and send it. back and let them reconsider in light of
the new statute.
MR. JAWORSKI;

That’s correct.

And the reason I

even went further is that I then believe that the appellate
court would send it back to the trial court at that point.
QUESTION:

Isn't it possible that both the Court

of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court thought the statute
didn’t apply because there were no spouses involved in this
litigation?
MR. JAWORSKI;

Well, your Honor, I have to believe

that because at the time that the opinion was written, the •—
QUESTION;

There are no spouses in this case, are

there?
MR. JAWORSKI;

That’s right.

4.02 was in existence

and, two, it had reference to spouses, and three, there have
been hotly debated arguments in our Texas legislature since
1968 and 1969 on this subject.
QUESTION:

So I just believe that —

And the court purposely said there are

no statutes which cover this.
MR. JAWORSKI;
QUESTION;

That’s right.

Because there are no spouses.

statute is limited to spouses

The

28
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

I agree, vour Honor.

Of course, are you suggesting that just

because the statute was passed in 1970 and this case 'was
decided by the Court of Civil Appeals in 1971, it was presumed
to know all the statutory law that might cover the case even
though it wasn’t quoted by counsel?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

I believe it should ba presumed.

I think that presumption (inaudible)

(Laughter.)
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, someone made reference to the

Texas courts, and maybe that’s applicable.
At any rate, levity has no place here.
that I am

I would say

prepared to meet the argument on its merits squarely,

was invited to argue in support of a judgment below, am prepared
to do so if it please the Court.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible) on that score, Mr. Wright

and Mr. Jaworski.
MR. JAWORSKI;

Thank you, sir.

Assuming jurisdiction, today this Court is presented
with the issues squarely of whether Texas should require or
sanction

paternity litigation, whether it be by statute or

by common law.

A reversal of the decision below and the

judgment in the trial court reads that it is based upon a
finding of law that there is no civil liability on the part
of a father to support an illegitimate child.

That's the

29
gravamen of the judgment in the trial court.

A reversal of

the decisions in that, judgment would in my judgment b© a
departure from a century of constitutional adjudication under
the equal protection clause.

A decision by this Court would

in effect be a decision never before made by this Court in
the area of family lax*
*/.

It xv-ould extend the case of Levv

and the Weber case which have been referred to in the briefs
extensively.

And it would disregard, in my view, the holdings

in Dandridg® v. Williams and Morey v. Doud.
We submit that there is no support in law or in
human experience for the result sought.

The sound principles
Texas has the tradi­

tional right to draw arbitrary classifications to facilitate
potentially difficult problems

of proof and to enhance the

administration of justice.
Now, v/ifch the Court’s permission, we would like to
with the time remaining address our attention first to the
applicable test in the event that the jurisdiction issue is
passed to reflect that the applicable test is rational

*

'” .

Two, Texas’ valid legislative purpose is (1) to

•minimize problems of proof, and (2) to avoid adverse effects
upon the administration of justice.
QUESTION:

Do you have to go so far as to say that

Taxas' justice is inferior to 43 States that have found that

30
they could do it?
MR. JAWORSKI:

Mr. Justice, that is the heart, of 'the

argument which we make,, and that is that the experience in the
other 48 States has been abysmal at best.
QUESTION:

You are prepared to prove this?

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, your Honor.

In our brief,

please the Court -—
QUESTION:

But if your brief had convinced me, I

wouldn't have asked the question.
MR. JAWORSKI:

I shall address myself to that.

Passing the applicable standard, if the Court please —
QUESTION:

If you are going to get to it, take it

in your own time.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

I shall, your Honor.

O.K.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Going to the applicable standard,

the ACLU in its amicus brief has raised the very narrow issue
of whether classifications of illegitimates is a suspect
classification as this Court views that terminology, therefore
requiring more active review.
Now, we submit that the rational relationship test
is applicable and, indeed, the appellants agree with that
by stating, and I quote from page 12 of their brief, "The test
is whether the state's classification is based upon a
difference which bears a substantial, reasonable and just

31

relation to the object for which it is proposed."
Dandridge indeed supports tills contention.

It states

clearly if the classification has some reasonable basis, it does
not offend the Constitution simply because the classification
is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice
it results in some inequality.

The Dandridge case, we submit

respectfully to this Court, is controlling here.

It is

closely analogous to the facts that are presented here on
the merits.

In the words of this Court, that case involved

the administration of public welfare assistance and involved
the most basic economic needs of impoverished human beings
and involved the attack upon the administration of public
welfare assistance.

And then the Court held that there was

no basis for a different constitutional standard.
Wow, passing to the question posed by Mr. Justice
Marshall, and that is the fundamental inquiry here, that is,
whether Texas has a valid rational interest in precluding
paternity suits.

What is Texas' valid interest?

And if it

has an interest, is it rational?
We meet this issue head on.

The answer is, first,

to minimize the very meaningful and apparent problems of
proof, and two, to minimize the danger of fraud and uncertainty
and inconclusiveness that surrounds paternity litigation.
Now, the right of a State to make such classifications
is traditional.

Texas or any other State, for that matter,

has the valid prerogative to draw arbitrary lines to facilitate
problems of proof.
recognized this.

This very Court has recently explicitly
And I am speaking of the Weber case.

The

Court said in that opinion at 1406, "Our decision fully
respects Louisiana's choice on this matter.... The State
interest in minimizing problems of proof is not significantly
disturbed by our decision."
"minimize."

Arid I should emphasise the word

Obviously, there are many different schemes and

many different statutes in many different States.

Counsel

alluded to statutes in other States which — and I believe
he said all States -™ allow inheritance by illegitimate
children.

That's simply in error.

There are 48 States and

there are 48 different statutes, and there is no uniform
statute for trying paternity suits.
The fact of potential danger, I expressly submit,
is a fact that is difficult to find issue with.

It's really

undisputed by commentators and authorities on the subject.
Xfc's undisputed by professor Krause who is recognized by
everyone involved in paternity litigation as the authority
today in respect to paternity suits and illegitimacy as a
whole.

And these people unanimously agree that wholesale

perjury and corruption is just a fact of life in a paternity
litigation, and it's supported by empirical data.
Now, 1*11 be the first to adroit that empirical data
can, you know, be disregarded.

You can consider it not worthy

people committed perjury.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, but the authorities that

I quote, your Honor, at pages 16 and 17 of our brief, were
based upon lie detector tests that these people

in one

test there were a thousand of them — submitted to lie detector
tests —
QUESTION:

Which is also questionable.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Lie detector tests.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, but my understanding of

the studies that have been made in respect of lie detector
tests is that they are 95 percent accurate.
QUESTION;

are there perjury?

MR. JAWORSKI:

I have not read any empirical data

QUESTION:

Well, with the same data, would you

Would you abolish divorces if you found the

same data?
MR. JAWORSKI:

I would not abolish divorces if you

found the same data, but —
QUESTION:
time the

For example, in New York where at one

only ground for divorce was adultery and thousands

of divorces were granted every day, but. no convictions were
ever made of the crime of adultery.

But they still left the

divorce law there.
MR. JAWORSKI:

My answer to that, your Honor, is

one that would be by way of example in Texas.

We found in

Texas that there was wholesale perjury in divorce cases.
QUESTION:

And you amended your divorce law, and

New York amended its divorce law, did it not?
MR. JAWORSKX:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

But did you abolish divorce?

MR. JAWORSKI:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

You amended the law.

QUESTION:

To eliminate the perjury.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

You didn’t.

Yes, sir, that’s right.

Why not do that here?

MR. JAWORSKI:

The point is, your Honor, that in

paternity litigation it is impossible to eliminate it for the
reasons I shall articulate.

In divorce cases when you have

two people standing up and they have a statute which makes
a divorce almost as a matter of right such as we have now in
Texas, there is no problem.

In the question of paternity-

litigation, you have the inherent problem of the inconclusive-

35

neas of paternity, particularly, your Honor, when you have a
woman who has had access to a number of man during the
conceptual period.
QUESTION;

Well, supprsing you have a case where a

woman who goes out with a man and they have 18 eye ‘witnesses
including 6 bishops of the Church to see them go in the room
together and is followed by a latter to him in which ha writes
back under a notory's

seal that ”J am the father of that

child.”

*.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

Texas.

YOUr Honor —

That woman could not get redress in

Am I right or wrong?
MR. JAWORSKI;

You are correct, your Honor, under

the present scheme, under the present status of the lav; and
the common law in Texas.

That is an unlikely hypothesis, I

respectfully submit.
The more normal situation is the one which was
presented here.
QUESTION:

Does Texas law impose a duty upon the

custodian of a child to support the child?
MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir.

And that custodian is the

mother.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume it's not the mother.

Let’s assume it’s an uncle or an aunt or an older — or a
generation ahead, a half-brother or sister.

36

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Does Texas law impose a duty?

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— of the child.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

On the custodian -—

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, to support the child.

So if the illegitimate father were the

custodian, if I understand your answer, he v/ould have a duty
to support —
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— just as the illegitimate mother who

is the custodian has a duty to support.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

This is correct, your Honor.

Now, by contrast, does Texas law impose

a duty upon an illegitimate mother of a child to support that
child if that child is in the custody of somebody else?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

No, sir, your Honor.

Then, doesn't the equal protection claim

evaporate in this case without your making the elaborate
arguments you are making?
MR. JAWORSKI:

I think that analysis can certainly

be made, your Honor, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Do I understand, then, from your response

to Mr. Justice Marshall that there isn't such a thing in

3?

Texas as an acknowledgement, of paternity procedure at all?
MR. JAWORSKI:

There is none in Texas today.

There is a proposal that, has been submitted;, your
Honor, to the Texas legislature since 1969.
submitted twice.

It has been

And it is a paternity statute.

And I think

that in response to your question that, on its face, helps
support and in fact confirms that which we state in our brief.
And that is that wholesale perjury and wholesale abuses obtain
in paternity litigation.
A little history might be appropriate her©.

This

paternity statute was prepared, .it was studied in 1968, and
it was submitted twice to our Texas legislature and rejected
both times.
QUESTION:

Could I interrupt you for one factual

piece of information?

As I understand, at the time of the

conception here, the putative father was married to someone
else.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, your Honor,

Does the record disclose whether at this

time he is still married?
MR. JAWORSKI:
your Honor.

The record does not disclose that,

The record discloses that the man was in the

service at Port Hood in Killeen, Texas, and has not been
heard of since.

The Court refused to grant — that is the

trial court — refused to grant his Plea in Abatement.

38

QUESTION;

I asked this because your brief contains

an intimation that children can be legitimatized by the marriage
of their parents, and I take it this just, you are speaking
merely in general terms.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTIONS

I am, your Honor.

Not in specific terms to these particular

people.
MR. JAWORSKI:

That is correct, your Honor.

Going back to the legislative history and the
statute which has been proposed, I would point out to the
Court that a similar statute has been prepared, or similar
bill, and is to be submitted to the next session of the
Texas legislature.
Now, that proposed bill is set forth in full at
Appendix A in our brief.

Now, that bill on its face confirms

that paternity suits are fertile field for corruption.
One, it provides for a one-year statute of limita­
tions versus two and four for tort and contract actions in
Texas.
Two, it provides for pretrail screen, very carefully,
in camera, to determine whether this is an extortionate type
of a demand being made by this woman.

The child and the

mother both must submit to blood tests or the case will be
dismissed out of hand to determine whether there is a
possibility of paternity.

39
’' ■

Dieting tills pretail procedure if a possibility of

paternity is not established by clear and convincing evidence,
not just a preponderance of evidence, but clear and convincingevidence, then the records are sealed, the case is dismissed,
the records are sent to Austin, our State capital, and they
are never to be reviewed
QUESTION:

again, except by court order.

Do the illegitimates inherit in Texas?

MR. JAWORSKI:

Through their mother only, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But no rights against the father?

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

And he can confer that right on them by

acknowledging paternity, you indicated before.
MR. JAWORSKI:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Section 40 —

I thought you responded to Justice

Blackmun that there was no statute to recognise them.
MR. JAWORSKI:

No, sir, I didn't mean to say that.

I meant to say that in this particular case the father, the
nominated father, was married, and I know not whether he is
married now.
QUESTION:

But if there was an acknowledgment, can

you get a support order?

Let * s'assume that some man wrote

a letter and said I agree, I confess, I am the father and
I acknowledge it, and then said

but I won't support, could

there be a support order entered against him?

40

MR. JAWORSKI:. My understanding is, yes, *—
QUESTION:

I thought you said no to Justice Blackmun.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Let me see the — the applicable

statute is Section 42 of the Probate Code.
I must correct myself.
QUESTION:

Does that work for both support and

inheritance or just inheritance?
MR. JAWORSKI:

It would work for legitimation.

And

once the child is legitimated, then he would inherit and he
would have all the rights of a legitimate child.
QUESTION:

Here, if the father was still married,

that section would not apply because the child could not be
legitimated.
MR. JAWORSKI:

That's right.

Section 42 — and I

want to make myself clear because I don't believe that it
was clear before — Section 42 of the Probate Code is the
applicable statute, and it says that where a man and a woman
have an illegitimate child and thereafter enter marriage, then
the child becomes legitimated for all purposes.
QUESTION:

But some States — these questions

address the fact that some States, for example Louisiana,
have a statute that even if the father is in fact married,
if he acknowledged paternity of the child, then certain
obligations ensue.

Texas, I gather, has no such statute.

MR. JAWORSKI:

No, sir.

In other words, Texas'

41
total finally scheme is one of where the mother has the
custody and all of the rights and obligations that flow from
it.
My time is about to expire and I was prepared to
submit to this Court argument to the effect that there are
both rights and responsibilities, not only responsibilities
but rights that flow to a mother by reason of her custody of
the illegitimate child,
QUESTION:

She can inherit from that child.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, sha can.

But there are substantial reasons why a father should
not be allowed to later come in and try to inherit from that
child.

The problems of proof become compounded,if the Court

follows me, in that respect.

If this Court held that a

paternity statute or a paternity action must obtain in Texas,
then under the situation Mr. Chief Justice Burger suggested,
then the father could come in 15, 20 years later and try to
inherit from the illegitimate child, and the problems of
proof would be paramount and compounded.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jaworski, may I as^ you a question?

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

In response to the question asked by

Mr. Justice Stewart with respect to the obligation of one who
has custody of the child, you said that the obligation would
be to support.

Does that apply to a formal order designating

42

someone as custodian,, or does it apply to custody de facto
without any formal designation of custodian by a court?

Does

it apply to both, or only to the formal designation?
MR. JAWQRSKJ:
ignorance on that.

Your Honor, I have to plead semi-

My understanding is that it applies both

ways, either a formal custody order or as a matter of de facto
custody you have that obligation, and if that obligation is
not fulfilled, then action can be brought to enforce that.
The description of the bill itself in response to
Mr.

Justice Marshall’s question, I think, might lay at rest

the issue of whether wholesale abuses do obtain in paternity
litigation.

The author of the bill that is to be presented

at the next session says that an "intricate system of
protections are built into the statute designed to prevent
bad faith, extortion, and publicity."
For reasons I have expressed, the Texas schema
makes good sense, and 1' request that the relief requested in.
our brief be granted.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Jaworski.

You acted by appointment of the courts, and we thank
you for your assistance to the Court and to the Texas court
whose position you were defending.
MR. JAWORSKI:

It was my privilege, your Honor.
