P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 53 Original, the United States
against the States of Nevada and California,.
Mr* Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. GRISWOLDs

May it please the Courts

This case is here on a motion by the United States
for leave to file an original complaint against the States of
Nevada and California*
The United States appears primarily in a fiduciary
capacity on behalf of the Pyramid Lake Indians of the Paiute
Tribe.
The United States does allege the ownership of
certain lands and water rights in its own right, but it would
not be here if that was its only claim*
The basic claim relates to the Pyramid Lake Ind5„an
Reservation in Nevada.

The general location is indicated by

the map which we have included in the pocket at the back of
our Complaint and Brief, and this is referred to in the
complaint.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Unfortunately, Mr,

Solicitor General, in the shuffling of papers, my map got lost*

QUESTIONS
too.

Mr. Solicitor General, mine was missing,

Would you mind stating that again?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Pyramid Lake is fed by the Truckee

River, which has its outlet — v/hich is the outlet of Lake
Tahoe.

Lake Tahoe is located partly in California and partly

in Nevada.

Now, the river runs for 20 miles in California,

where it gets most of its water, and then it flows for 65
miles in Nevada until it empties into Pyramid Lake.
The part we note on the map, just above the center,
the Derby Diversion Dam, and then the Truckee Canal, which
diverts a substantial part of the water of the Truckee River
into the Carson River System; and the Carson River System, with
the water from the Truckee stiver, produces the Newlands
Irrigation District, which is the green area in the right part
of the map.
The way the map appears, one could get the

5

impression that the Carson River is also an outlet of Lake
Tahoe, but that is wrong- The Carson River rises in the
mountains to the east of Lake Tahoe, and the water from Lake
Tahoe gets to the Hewlands Irrigation District through the
Truckee Canal from 'the Truckee River, and thereby represents
water which does not flow on to Pyramid Lake.
Pyramid Lake is 30 miles north of Reno.

It’s a

9

remarkable lake? some say it's the finest dasert lake in the
country.
The Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation originated on
November 29th, 1859, and was confirmed by President Grant by
an executive order issued on March 23rd, 1874,
The Pyramid Lake Indians had a culture which was
based primarily on fish, on which they lived and for which
they used for barter.

And the lake provided a large and

remarkable fishery, and the purpose of including the lake in
the reservation was to maintain the source of the Indians'
livelihood#

papers;

Two fish are mentioned somewhere in these

a variety of cutthroat trout and then another fish

I'd never heard of.

What's that fish?

MR, GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice, that «•“ I heard of

it in connection with this case.

It's spelled c-u-i hyphen u-i,

MR* GRISWOLDs

QUESTION: Say that again»
MR. GRISWOLD:

C-u-i hyphen u-ij and it’s pronounced

"quee-wee".
QUESTION:

Now, is that a variety of trout?

MR. GRISWOLD:
the Pyramid Lake.
QUESTION:

That is a fish which is peculiar to

The Lahontan cutthroat trout
Right.

MR. GRISWOLD:

— was a very large and successful}

commercially and otherwise, fish, which was peculiar to Pyramid
Lake.
Pyramid Lake is the geological residue of an older
lake called Lahontan, and, indeed, the reservoir created in
the Carson River is now called Lahontan Lake.
And the fish in Pyramid Lake, and that's part of
the complaint here, the cutthroat trout in Pyramid Lake have
been unable to maintain themselves because with the fall in
the level of the lake the fish are unable to get up the
Truck.ee River to spawn»
Now, the fish have been taken out and put into fish
hatcheries and now are planted in Pyramid Lake, and they are
also found in some of the other lakes) but without the help of
man, the Lahontan cutthroat trout would be extinct now.

It

QUESTION:

Are cui-ui found anywhere else, do you

know?
MR. GRISWOLD;

As I understand it, not any place

else; no place else, unless they have been taken out and
planted, but -QUESTION;

All right.

Is that a member of the trout

family, or is that something quite different?
MR. GRISWOLD;
that.

I'm not enough of a biologist to say

I believe so, but I do not know; except that I think

that it has a — I think it would go back millions of years
before you would find a —

QUESTION: Do the cui-ui have to go upstream, too?
MR. GRISWOLD:

As I understand it, they do not.

The cui-ui can apparently —
QUESTION:

Reproduce in the lake.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I am told that they are of the

sturgeon family, the cui-ui is.
QUESTION:

That's quite different, then.

MR. GRISWOLD;

In 1903, after the passage of the

Reclamation Act in 1902, the Newlands Reclamation Project was
established by the Secretary of the Interior, named after a
Senator from Nevada.
In 1905, the Derby Dam was completed, with the
consequent diversion of much of the water from the Truckee
River to the Carson River system.

As a result of this and

8
other activities, the water flowing down the Truckee River to
Pyramid Lake has been reduced to about 250,000 acre-feet, while
375,000 to 400,000 acre-feet are required to replace evaporation
losses and maintain the level of the lake.
Because of this annual deficit of 125,000 to 150,000
acre-feet, the level of the lake dropped more than 80 feet
since 1906.
QUESTION!

Mr» Solicitor General, does your complaint

show what the annual flow in acre-feet was before the Newlands
diversion?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I'm not sure that the complaint does.

The material referred to in the complaint, particularly the
Pyramid Lake Task Porce Report, of which copies have been
distributed to the Court, give figures going back to the 186Q's
as to the flow into Pyramid Lake.
♦

QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, has the lowering of

the level of the water in the lake resulted solely from the
diversion to the other river?
MR. GRISWOLD!

Yes, Mr. Justice,

The level of the

lake probably would have fluctuated because of variations in
annual rainfall which — the natural runoff of the river varies
apparently from 200,000 to 1.1 million.

It averages enough

to maintain the level of the lake at the level where it was
in 1860.
Apparently there has been a constant slight diminution

9

in the lake, but this has become very marked since the
diversion of the water by the Derby Dam and the Newlands —
QUESTION:

But I understand that that trend has

now been arrested, hasn’t it?
QUESTION:

Reversed.

MR. GRISWOLD:

It has been arrested, but it has not

been — necessarily, we can’t foresee the future, that it would
be stopped because of various actions which have occurred?
part of which is a substantial rainfall in recent years.

But

under a suit brought by the Indians, if I may say so, in their
desperation, in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, to compel the Secretary to follow his
own regulations and to avoid and prevent wastage of water,
there has been a considerable increase in the amount of water,
and it is true that in the past six years the level of the
lake has risen by about ten feet.

So that the net fall of

the lake, at this point, is about 70 feet.
There is a picture of the *— from the Truckee River
flowing into the lake, in the Task Force Report, on page 17,
which has been distributed to the Court, or at least made
available to the Co-art in enough copies.
QUESTION:

Has that been circulated?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, I'm now told only one copy was

filed with the Clerk; I thought one had been made for each
member of the Court,

I would suggest you look at page 17.

10
You will find a picture of the Truckee River entering in what,
amounts to a big delta into the lake.

The drop of 70 feet

makes it impossible for the fish to get up the river and spawn.
This has destroyed the fisheries? it threatens
extinction of the trout native to the lake? it increases the
salinity of the lake? causes land erosion; and threatens
continued existence of the lake as a useful body of water.
On behalf of the Indians, through this suit, the
United States contends that when the Pyramid Lake Reservation
was established in 1859, the United States, by implication,
reserved for the benefit of the Pyramid Lake Indians sufficient
water from the Truckee River for the maintenance and
preservation of Pyramid Lake.

And for the maintenance of the

lower reaches of the Truckee River as a natural spawning
ground for fish.
The United States claims these rights for the Pyramid
Lake Indians with a priority date of November 29th, 1859.
Whether this claim is warranted, whether the Indians have these
rights, is the principal issue before the Court in this case.
Now, the complaint also contains reference to a suit
which the United States brought in connection with the
Newlands Project.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, that Newlands

Project is the one in the Carson River setup, isn't it?
I don't see the name "Newlands" on here

11
MR. GRISWOLD;

Perhaps it is not, but that is what

it is known by, and it is so referred to in the complaint.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

That whole project —

I'm just trying to identify it on the map.

MR. GRISWOLD; That whole project — do you have one
that's colored?
QUESTION;

No, we don’t.

MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, I’m sorry.

That whole

project in the right half, right third of the map is the
Newlands Project.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

It obtains water from the Carson

River, as to which there also is a suit in the Nevada courts,
one which, over a period of 30, 40 years, operates on the
basis of a temporary injunction.

That’s all that has ever

been issued.
The diversion of the water from the Truckee River
to the Newlands Project -QUESTION:
General?

Could you hold up that map, Mr. Solicitor

None of the four of us on this side have the green

one.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

None of us have it.
That’s upside-down.

MR. GRISWOLD;

Oh, it’s upside-down»

12
How's that?
QUESTION! Doqs Newlands drain into the Colorado?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Oh, no, Mr. Justice, the Newlands

drains into what they call a sink ouc there and disappears.
In fact, the sink has greatly augmented because of the undue
diversion from the Truckee River, the runoff water from the
Newlands Project goes into the sink, and that has made a new
wildlife refuge where there are ducks and where hunters go,
we would say, using the Indians’ water for the purpose of
erecting a new sporting and non-commercial activity.
QUESTION:

Where is that, out in Stillwater Point?

MR. GRISWOLD:

That is on the map at — beyond

Stillwater Point, —
QUESTION:

Oh.

MR. GRISWOLD!

At the slough?
— and finally, when you get to

Stillwater Wildlife Management Area, near the upper righthand
corner, and the slough which is at the right edge of the map.
Now, there's quite a lot of water there.

That water

will presumably be cut down and allowed to go down the Truckee
River as a result of the decision of the District of Columbia
Court in the case requiring the Secretary to conduct a more
careful and efficient operation of the Orr River Project.
QUESTION!

Is the water in the sump saline?

MR. GRISWOLD!
QUESTION!

The water —?

In the sump, is the water in the sump salt

13

water or fresh water?
MR. GRISWOLD!
QUESTION;

In Pyramid Lake?

You were talking about the Stillwater

sump.
MR. GRISWOLD: That is essentially fresh, Mr. Justice.
I suppose that in — that is, in the water that goes into the
wildlife refuge is essentially fresh.

I suppose that having

percolated through the land it has picked up some salt.

But

the water that goes down the Truckee River is particularly
fresh, is remarkably fresh.
QUESTION:

I was just wondering about the end product

of the sump, xdiether that's salt water —
MR. GRISWOLD:
fresh water.

As I understand it, it is essentially

And it finally percolates into the ground and

disappears,
Pyramid Lake is more saline than fresh-water lakes
we are used to in this part of the country, but it is
remarkably non-saline when it has an adequate water supply,
QUESTION:

Does the complaint or other materials

before us indicate the extent of the fishing rights that the
Indians are claiming?

Is it just broadly to maintain the lake

and the fish as they ware when the reservation was created,
or is it —
MR, GRISWOLD: Well, it isn't even quite that far,
Mr. Justice. We don't ask for enough water to restore the level

14
of the lake to what it was in 1859.

The prayer of the

complaint is on page 14, "prays that a decree be entered
declaring trie right of the United States for the benefit of the
Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians to the use of sufficient
waters of the Truckae River to fulfill the purposes for which
the Pyramid Lake Reservation was created, including the
maintenance and preservation of Pyramid Lake and the maintenance
of the lower reaches of the Truckee River as & natural spawning
ground for fish."
Incidentally, I am told that *"»
QUESTIONi Well, is the fishing.right one for
sustenance or is it a commercial —MR. GRISWOLD: For both.
QUESTION:

— thing?

MR. GRISWOLD: For both, Mr. Justice, That was the
way they used it at the —
QUESTION: What is the commercial end of it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

The commercial end would be that the

Indians would sell large quantities of avery remarkable fish
for which they would get money, with which they would buy
clothes and other kinds of foods.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Do they sell the fish to other —

to fish hatcheries, or do they sell it as food, or what?
MR. GRISWOLD:

They have historically, Mr. Justice.

There have been substantial fishery establishments there,

15
including the canning of fish.

This is all greatly restricted.

We're told by counsel for the States that there are only 400
Indians who live there now; but there are 500 who don't live
there and have, in affect, been driven away because the
economic possibilities of maintaining themselves have gone
with the disappearance of the fisheries,
QUESTION;

There are no treaty fishing rights that

are depended upon here at all, as I understand it.

You're

relying upon the implied reservation of water for the Indian
Reservation, alone.
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Justice,

But the Indians

own the lake, so til at they —
QUESTION;

Yes, but it's not like a lot of these

cases where we're dealing with fishing rights.
MR. GRISWOLD;

— they would have the fishing rights

if there were adequate fishing,
QUESTION;

Yes, but they weren't given any fishing

rights, this was a reservation originally, in 1859, confirmed
by President Grant in the 1870's, and you're relying on the
Arizona doctrine of an implied reservation of water, isn't that
it?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr, Justice.

That's exactly it.

And telling us that historically these

people lived by fishing, that was their economy.
no fishing rights.

There are

16

MR. GRISWOLDs That is exactly our position.
QUBSTIGH;

That's what I thought.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I would suppose that the only question

here apparently arises because of this Court’s decision in
Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemical Company, and more recently in
Illinois v» Milwaukee, and it will be my purpose to try to
show that the approach taken in those cases is not applicable
here and that the motion for leave to file a complaint should
be granted.
This case does not raise questions of State or local
law, as was the situation in Wyandotte»

The questions here

are Federal questions, of the sort which this Court has
traditionally considered in original suits.

The United States

appears as a trustee for an Indian Tribe, exercising one of its
greatest responsibilities under the Constitution.

The questions

imrolved are Federal questions, essentially the effect of the
establishment of an Indian Reservation by Federal authority
and the application to that Reservation of the rule of the
case of Winters v. United States, and the very closely
comparable case of Arizona v. California, to which Mr. Justice
Stewart referred, where the United States intervened in an
original suit on behalf of Indian Tribes, and this Court made
essentially the same sort of adjudication that we’re seeking
here.
The order in Arizona v. California provides that a

17
million acre-feet of water shall be made available to the
Indians at the suit of the United States.
And there is also involved the effect, if any, on the
rights of the Indians on the establishment of the Newlands
Irrigation Project under the Reclamation Act*

The claim made

by the »—
QUESTIONS When was that established, Mr. Solicitor
General?

When was the Newlands Project begun?
MR. GRISWOLDs The Newlands Project was authorized in

.1903.

There was a suit called the Orr Water Ditch suit filed

in 1913, in which a final decree was entered in 1944, and one
of the questions in this case iss

What is the effect of that

on the rest of the Indians?
We contend that it does not bar the rights of the
Indians, but that's one of the issues which would be heard
if the leave to file the complaint was granted.
The claim made by the United States relates to the
»■

waters of an interstate stream, and thus presents the kind of
question appropriate for decision by this Court.
And moreover, and most important, this Court is the
only tribunal which can make a definitive and final adjudica­
tion of the right claimed on behalf of the Indians.
Nevada suggests in its brief that the suit could
proceed in the District Court for Nevada, despite the fact that
most of the water comes from California, and an adjudication

18

with respect to the rights of the Indians made by the Nevada
court would not be binding on California or on California
citizens.
Nevada says that the Nevada District Court could
reach California and its citizens through some sort of a longarm approach.

Perhaps Congress could authorize this, and for

a period of four years, from 1922 to 1926, Congress did
authorize what amounts to interstate suits in the District
Courts with respect to water and other matters, and some of
the cases cited here began in that period, notably the
Brooks case, which was a contempt case for violating a decree
which was — involved Arizona and New Mexico in a suit brought
during the period when the Arizona court was given jurisdiction
over parties in New Mexico.
Congress could authorize it, but it hasn't done so,
and I know of no basis for such jurisdiction in a case like
fcliis.

Incidentally, in the careful and thoughtful brief
filed on behalf of California here, there is no such suggestion
California does not come forward and say it wants to appear in
a Nevada District Court.
QUESTION:

Is there any possibility for parallel

suits in Federal courts in California and Nevada and then be
having them thrown into the multi «-district panel?
MR. GRISWOLD:

I know of no way?the multi-district

19

deals with cases where the court has jurisdiction with
respect to the issue.

Here the Nevada Court would not have

jurisdiction over the California water rights; the California
Court would not have jurisdiction over the Nevada water rights.
And I know of no authority under the multi-district suit to
require them to get together and to come to the same conclusion
on the questions of fact or of law.
This Court may be concerned, if it takes jurisdiction
of the case, that it will be involved in a multitude of
factual determinations with respect to individual water rights.
Perhaps if thousands of persons, both in Nevada and in
California — 1' think that concern is unwarranted.
The basic question here is an important one, and it
may present some legal difficulties.

But the problem is one

which the Court is well equipped to resolve.
The question raised here is whether the United States
has any right on behalf of the Pyramid Lake Indians and, if so,
what is the extent of that right?
If it is established that the Pyramid Lake Indians
are entitled to a definite amount of water, vrifch a fixed
temporal priority, then it will be known what water remains
for use in California and in Nevada.

At that point it may

well be that the two States can agree on their relative
portions of the remaining water, as they have agreed in a
Compact, which is pending before Congress but not approved by

20

Congress? but based on the assumption that the Indians have
no rights.

The Compact does say that it doesn’t deprive

anybody o£ any rights, but it doesn’t recognize that there are
any such rights.
The United States has no interest whatever in how
the allocation to California and Nevada is divided among their
individual water users.

And the District Court in Nevada can

make the appropriate allocations among Nevada users, if that
question, too, is not settled by agreement*
Now, I have mentioned the Compact, and I don’t have
time to discuss it.

It obviously is of no legal significance,

because it has not been approved by Congress.
Incidentally, both Senators from California have
joined in a statement — I mention this because it indicates
the unlikelihood that Congress is going to approve the contract,
if both Senator from California oppose it.
a statement in which they conclude;

They have joined in

“We therefore support

the efforts of the Tribe and Federal Government to obtain a
judicial determination in the Supreme Court,"
QUESTION;

Well, if we grant your motion, this would

necessitate the appointment of a Master, would it not?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Eventually it might, but it seems to

me that this basic question, whether the Indians have any
right and, if so, its extent ~~ it would be helpful to have it
heard before a Master,

But it would be a relatively simple

21

matter before a Master, and not the question of allocating
water rights among all the people in a great —
QUESTION;

More like the Tidelands decisions?

MR. GRISWOLD s

It would be very much like the

Tidelands, although perhaps somewhat simpler than that, and
not involving the massive historical considerations that were
there.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, do I gather from

your answer to Mr. Justice Douglas' question that the
government doesn't really seriously press the idea that the
case ought to be partially adjudicated here before it's
referred to a Master?
MR. GRISWOLD;
of difference.

I don't think it makes a great deal

I think what we are trying to say on that is

that it otight to be adjudicated here on the basic issue,
do the Indians have a right or not, before there is any
consideration given to the problem of how you allocate the
remaining water.
Now, whether —*
QUESTION: Excuse me.

What we have hare is —

this is an argument on a motion for leave to file a bill of
complaint, as I understand it.
MR, GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And there haven't even been responsive

pleadings on it, r.o answers.

22

MR. GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

There haven't even been answers„

No.

MR. GRISWOLD;

And I should think that —

QUESTION; So the issues haven't been filed.
MR» GRISWOLD;

— after the answers have been filed

and we know what is denied and what needs to be proved —
QUESTION: Right,
MR. GRISWOLD;

Exactly.

— it would be possible at that point

to — it could well be that the answers will be filed in such
form as to raise only a legal question, at least at the
threshold.
QUESTION; Exactly.
MR. GRISWOLD: And that threshold question, do the
Indians have a right or don't they, can be presented as a
purely legal question.

It becomes a little more complicated

when you say, Yes, they have a right, but what is its extent?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

For example, the Indians do not claim

that they are entitled to 375,000 acre-feet every year.
Sometimes the water goes down.

I think their position would

be that they are entitled to an average of 375,000 acre-feet
over a period of, let's say, ten years; so that if it goes
down one year, some water can be made available to the Newlands
Project, and it can be made up in subsequent years.
It's undoubtedly true that there have been differ-

23

ences of opinion and conflicts of interest within the Interior
Department about this claim of the Pyramid Lake Indians, the
Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs do not
always see eye to eye.

It's equally true that the Department

of Justice has not advanced this claim in prior proceedings.
The Indians should not be bound by that.
There will be argument about res judicata and merger
in bar, and our position is that the Indians should not be
bound to their great loss by reason of defaults which may have
occurred on the part of officers of the United States in the
past —• and I don’t criticize them, because they were reflecting
a national attitude at that time.

It was a great step when

the Secretary of the Interior requested the Department of
Justice to start this case in this Court.

It would be

something of a tragedy for the Indians if this Court should
now refuse to consider the claim made on their behalf.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Prettyraan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I am Barrett Prettyman, and I represent the
defendant State of Nevada in this Original action.
In the few minutes allotted to me, I am not going to
be able to discuss some of the purely legal questions in our

24
briefs, such as res judicata and collateral estoppel and
even case or controversy against the State.

I am going to have

to rely on our brief for those points.
Instead, my argument here is going to be restricted
to the reasons why this Court should not in its discretion,
assuming that it has jurisdiction, why it should not exercise
that original jurisdiction in this case.
In case after case after case this Court has
emphasized the States should work out problems relating to
mutual boundaries or interstate streams themselves, if they
can do it.

And in case after case it was only after such

attempts at reconciliation between the States had failed that
this Court had agreed to exercise its original jurisdiction.
How, here, what do we have?
We have the two States where the disputed water is
located agreeing, after more than 15 years of negotiations,
on an equitable apportionment of the waters involved.
We have a Joint Task Force that the government
participated in, after long study, finally agreeing on
recommendations which, as has already been noted, have already
begun to increase the water for Pyramid.

As a matter of fact,

the water level has risen some 11 or 12 feet in the last few
years, ever since the Interior Department has begun concentrating
on their operating criteria and putting them more in shape,
QUESTION;

How do the rights of the Indians, Mr,.

25

Prettyman, figure in this negotiation that you’ve just
described?
MR. PRETTYMAN: Well, in the first place, the Indians
originally participated in the Task Force? they withdrew;
then submitted statements and witnesses in regard to the
Compact.

They specifically made some objections to the

Compact as it was originally drafted, and those objections
were taken into consideration.

And this is quite important.

Let me give you two examples»

Originally,

California was given an unlimited right to create extra flow,
to create extra water, after the original tidal basin was
taken care of.

The Indians objected to that, and a 10,000

acre-foot limit was put on California's right.
In another example, the Indians were given a
maximum right, based on Orr Water Ditch, plus municipal and
other use, which was actually being put to beneficial use?
they could not get any more water after that.

That was

eliminated because of their objection,
So that after their Orr Water Ditch commitment now,
and after California's share comes out, then the use goes back
to Hevada again, and the Indians have a full right to get the
amount of money — the amount of water that they can show that
they need from that.
These are two examples of objections which the
Indians had to the Compact and which were taken care of in the

26

Compact.
QUESTION;

Of course the Constitution provides for

interstate compacts, it doesn't provide, to the best of my
knowledge, for compacts between the States and the United
States.

I suppose your point is that Congress wouldn’t

approve, as it has to do under the Constitution, of an inter­
state compact that wasn’t satisfactory to the United States;
but I would suppose the response to that would be, well, in
this case it’s not the Congress that is the guardian of the
Indian wards, but it's the Executive Branch of the Government
that's the guardian.

And we can't leave this matter to the

self-interest, if you will, of States like California and
Nevada, that are represented in the Congress by Senators and
Representatives representing those States; but, rather, to the
Executive Branch.
And there's no room, under the Constitution at least,
for a compact among States and the Executive Branch of the
Government, is there?
MR, PRETTYMAM;

Well, the Compact will not become

operative until Congress approves it, —
QUESTION;

Congress.

MR, PRETTYMAN:

The Congress.

— and we think that in view of the

fact that the Federal Government has been intimately involved
in the development of the Compact, and in view further of the
fact that the State of Nevada is also concerned about the

27
Indians1 rights in making sure that this level, that the lake
is kept at a certain level.
QUESTIONs

Yes.

MR. PRETTYMAN; We think that -they should be
presenting their arguments to Congress rather than here, in
view of this long history of negotiations between the States
where finally, unlike these other cases which you've had where
the States are unable to come to agreement, we have been able
to come to an agreement; and the agreement is such that the
Indians could not possibly be damaged.

The United States

doesn't claim that they’re going to be damaged by this
Compact.
QUESTION;

Do the Indians agree with —

MR, PRETTYMAN;

Pardon me, sir?

QUESTION; Do you have any evidence that the Indians
agree with this Compact?
MR. PRETTYMAN; Well, I think the Indians, obviously,
would much prefer a declaration by this Court that they have
a Winters

right to X amount of water; they undoubtedly would

prefer that to the Compact.
On the other hand, our position is that if the
Compact is approved, California's share is so small, it's a
maximum of 45,000 acre-feet, you've got five hundred sixty or
eighty thousand acre-feet of water here involved, that they
could not possibly be harmed by California's share»

You are

28

going to have plenty of water coming into Nevada, and if a
problem arises later, then the Indians can sue at the appro­
priate time, either in Nevada — they could sue in Nevada —
QUESTION: Sue against the Compact?
MR. PRETTYMANs

No.

They would not be suing against

the Compact, Mr. Justice Marshall, because the Compact would
leave plenty of water in Nevada for their share.
You understand that the Indians, at the very -~
QUESTION:

The only thing I understand is that the

fish are gone.
MR. PRETTYMAN: Well, sir, I beg to differ with you.
The fish, the United States has told Judge Gesell, are
thriving.
QUESTION:

In the other lawsuit?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, sir.

The fish are thriving

today because of great improvement in the level of Pyramid
Lake, and other things which are taking place there through
the Secretary of Interior's operating criteria.
QUESTION: So if we grant this motion, we certainly
would have to give it to a Master, just to find out if the
fish are thriving, would we not?
MR, PRETTYMAN:

You undoubtedly would have to appoint

a Master; if you accept this case, let me tell you what's
going to happen.
First of all, the Compact is going to come to a halt.

29

Congress obviously is not going to approve the Compact while
the issue is now pending before this Court*
QUESTIONs

Well, it's been there how many years,

Mr * P re t tyman ?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

The Compact has been •— it’s almost

17 years, sir.
QUESTION! That’s what I thought? several years.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

No. 2 —

Just one question, Mr. Prettyman.

If

Congress approves a compact that’s inconsistent with some
Indian claim, I would take it the congressional action would
supersede whatever Indian claim might have existed, wouldn’t
it?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

If you were to take an extreme case,

where so much water was given to California that it in effect
obliterated the Indians’ right, I think that there would foe
authority to do that in the same way that you could take away
a man’s land through an international treaty with, say,
Canada or Mexico.
I think that it would supersede„

But I want to

emphasise again that there’s no question of that in this
case.

Because if you look at what the Indians are asking,

when they say

Winters right, they’re not talking about some

esoteric theory where this Court says

winters- right, and

puts a stamp on it? they’re asking for enough water to maintain

30

the lake, namely 385,000 acre-feet,
QUESTION;

You call it

what — Winters right or

rights, or winners’ rights?
MR, PRETTYMAN;

Winters

right, yes, sir.

That

comes from the Winters case, Mr. Justice, where you —
QUESTION;

Oh.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

— first discussed the fact that

there was an implied reservation —
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. PRETTYMAN;

That there was an implied reserva­

tion of water along with an Indian Reservation,,
QUESTION; That's what you mean by Winters rights,
then; I see*
MR. PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Mr. Prettyman, going back to the

vindication of the Indians' rights after an allocation is made
of the greater proportion of this to the State of Nevada, would
you enlarge a little bit for me on how they vindicate that
right.

Is that a suit in the District Court against the

State?
MR. PRETTYMAN;
work.

Let me show you exactly how it would

The Compact is approved; at that point California

takes out, as I say, at a maximum — and this really is a
maximum ■— 45,000 acre"feet.
acre-feet flowing into Nevada.

So you now have over 300,000
If thereafter the Indians were

31

not getting their sufficient share, in view of your ruling that
their share would be allocated to the State, they would then
sue the State of Nevada in the Nevada Federal District Court
to get their portion of the 300,000 that was part of the
State’s use»
In other words, they would sue Nevada because the
only disagreement would be between the Indians on the one hand,
and the amount of water that Nevada has now collected on the
other.

There would be no conflict or controversy with

California.
QUESTION:

But you don't suggest that there’s any

other court right now in which a suit could be filed and
would settle this matter?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

We do, although I'm not going to

take the time to argue it here? we do claim that California
could be brought into the State of Nevada.

There's a

recent case by the California Supreme Court, called Hall vs»
University of Nevada, which we say supports that idea.

But

I don't have to take that position now, Mr. —
QUESTION:

You think the more persuasive one is

to wait on the Compact and then sue?
MR. PRETTYMAN: Well, our point is this:

that if

you allow Congress to act — Nov?, what's happened here, the
Compact has been placed in the Congress, the appropriate
committees have, asked for the comments of the United States —

32

QUESTIONS What's held it up for 17 years?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Negotiations on what the shares were

going to be.
QUESTION!

Well, it hasn't been before Congress all

that time?
MR. PRETTYMANj

No, sir.

No, no, no.

It's only

been before Congress the last Session and this Session. That's
the only time it's been before Congress.
All of these, some 15 years, —
QUESTION;

Well, what is it the Solicitor General

suggested that the Senators of California would prefer?
MR. PRETTYMAN; Well, there are two Senators which
have made statements on behalf of the Indians in California.
I would prefer that Mr. Walston, speaking for California,
address himself to that. But I don't think, obviously, that's
going to control here.
QUESTION; Well, I would suppose, as a practical
matter, if the Senators from one of the contracting States
opposed it, there's no chance that Congress will approve it,
is there?
MR. PRETTYMAN: We would hope that they would see
the light, Mr. Justice; and particularly after you don't
allow the claim here.
QUESTION; Well, fir. Prettyman, filing the case
wouldn’t necessarily keep the parties to the case, including

33

the United States, from settling it, would it?
MR. PRETTYMA.N;

Mr. Justice, if you take this case,

I can assure you, as a practical matter, that a number of
things are going to happen.
First of all, Congress is going to scop dead in its
tracks in trying to approve the contract.
Secondly, the various recommendations that have been
made by the Task Force for improving the lake are going to
stop, because nobody is going to know how much water has to
go to the Indians.

The Interior Secretary’s operating

criteria, which he is now under order to improve here, and
which is going to produce still more water if he has the
jurisdiction to do it for Pyramid Lake, are going to come to
a complete halt, again, because nobody is going to know what
we’re talking about here in terms of these Winters rights.
I emphasise to you that a Winters right is not some
definite, specific figure; you have to go back and find out
what the situation was in 1359, at the time the Reservation
vms created, what the Indians were doing; we’re not as all
sure as the Solicitor General that they were engaged in all
this much fishery, for example.

And we have to go through that

entire business.
Orr Water Ditch, which is a case which adjudicated,
we say, the very rights that are under consideration here,
took, I think it was something like 20 years for them to coma

34

to any conclusion.
Now, Orr Water Ditch, you understand, already ^fives
the Indians 30,000 acre-feet a year; that is adjudicated.
And we say that that actually covers this case and is fully
determinative.
But even if it isn't, the fact of the matter is that
what the Indians want they are either getting or are about to
get.
says.

They want 385,000 acre-feet.

That's what their brief

That's what the United States says.

Because 385,000

acre-feet is going to sustain that lake at its present levelB
That’s what they want.
How, when we turn to that, what do we find?
We find that there has been a tremendous amount of
water, increasing recently, into Pyramid Lake because of the
changes that I've talked about, and we also have these
specific recommendations of the Task Force, some of which are
being carried out..
Let me give you an example „

One of the things that

the Task Force represented was a cloud-seeding project.

Well,

that sounds a little far out, but in truth we're now into the
third year, because of that recommendation, of the cloudseeding project? and they found in the first two years that
there was a 14 percent and a 10 percent increase in precipita­
tion as a result of that.
In hard, cold fact, that 14 percent produces 140,000

35
acre-feet of water. 120,000 of which goes to Pyramid»

This

is one of the reasons why Pyramid, we think, has started back
up again.
There are other recommendations that the Task Force
made.

They said, for example, if you enforce your present

decrees, if you will go into the District Court with decrees
that you have right now and enforce them, that you’ll find —
and they gave a specific figure of how much that would produce.
S500 acre-feet there.
They talked about certain TCID improvements, the
Truckee-Carson Irrigation District improvements, which would
produce another 85,000.

And so we have these recommendations,

part of which are being implemented right now, and part of
which will be if the Court doesn't take things over, which we
say is already beginning to sustain the lake, and which
certainly will sustain the lake if you don't take this case,
and which, if everybody is allowed to proceed — for example,
if you don't take this case, and I might say we think the
United States is suing the wrong party here, we think they
ought to be suing themselves, because Judge Gesall took the
position that the Secretary of the Interior was not properlycarrying out his responsibility in his own operating
criteria.
And we say that if you combine these various factors,
if you combine the Compact, if you combine the recommendations

36

that have been made, some of which are already being carried
out, if you add into that Judge Gesell's order about improving
these operating criteria, you're going to have more than enough
water for Pyramid Lake.
We hope ~ obviously I can't guarantee this — but we
say until these things have had an opportunity to show them­
selves, until we’ve had an opportunity in good faith to carry
out what's gone on here, why should we stop the whole thing
right now, after these 17 years, bring it all to a halt, and
suddenly have this Court appoint a Special Master and go back
and begin determining for I don't know how many additional
years what the Winters rights is.
If there was a question about what they really
wanted from these Winters rights, I would take a different
position, but there's no question, they want 385,000 acre-feet.
QUESTION j

Has the filing of this motion for leave

to file interrupted anything?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, in the first place, the United

States has not responded to Congress' request for comments,
I am sure because of this case, and won’t until there is some
decision here.

That’s No. 1„

No. 2, there are projects which have been recommended
by the Task Force which require money, and obviously I don't
think the State can be expected to commit any funds if it
were willing to, with not knowing what the Indians were

37

eventually going to get.
And also I don't think there's any question but that
Judge Gesell's order would, in effect, be ignored if this Court
were to take jurisdiction, because, obviously, a ruling here
would, in effect, override much of what he's done*
So I think there's no question about what the
practical effect would be.
QUESTIONt The Compact is in the Judiciary Committee,
is it?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION!

Yes, sir*

Yes.

Does it go to the committees of both

houses?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, sir.

It's S, 24 and H. R. 15

at the moment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, if a Special Master were

appointed at some stage, not necessarily right away, if this
relief were granted, would this necessarily mean that the
Special Master would have to retread all of this ground, or
could he not draw on what the Task Force and what the
negotiations have flushed out in the way of evidence?
MR. PRETTYMAN!

Mr. Chief Justice, in the United

States District Court in Nevada there is a room full of
records relating to Qrr Water Ditch.

It's perfectly true,

he could go through them; but he's got a long, hard, difficult
task ahead of him.

38
I don't want to mislead you for a moment that this is
a question of sitting down and reading a few papers and coming
to a conclusion.

Everybody who has dealt with this problem

has found it extraordinarily difficult, it's taken an awful
long time.
May I just end by quoting to you something that was
said just last year by the National Water Commission that was
appointed by the President.

It said:

The future utilization

of Indian rights on fully appropriated streams will divest
prior uses initiated under State law and, curiously enough,
often financed with Federal funds, and will impose economic
hardship amounting to disaster in some cases on users with
large investments made over a long period of time.
That’s the reason that the State of Nevada is
concerned, because, obviously, we have an interest in the
Indians, in preserving the some 400 Indians? but we’re also
terribly concerned about the water that goes in the Newlands,
tiiat irrigates some 64,000 acres of land? we’re concerned about
the quarter of a million people in the area who —
QUESTION: Are you talking about the ducks?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Pardon me, sir?

QUESTIONS Are you talking about the ducks?

You’re

concerned about the ducks in the Wetlands?
MR, PRETTYMAN: Well, sir, if
wildlife »•»

when you get to

39

QUESTION;

Is the Solicitor General correct about

that, that it's all it's used for is the ducks?
MR. PRETTYMANs
used for ducks?

Oh, no, sir.

You mean — Newlands

No, sir.

Newlands, the spilloff from Newlands helps the
Stillwater Wildlife Refuge, but you've got 64,000 acres of
land out there under irrigation, sir.

You've got 5,000

farmers, you have a quarter of a million people in the area
who are depending upon water from the Truckee.

We're not

talking about protecting ducks.
QUESTIONSApproximately how much is the wetlands?
What percentage would it be?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Well, but it's spilloff, sir, it's

what's left over after —
QUESTION:

What percentage?

MR. PRETTYMANs

I'm sorry, I can’t give you the

actual percentage, but it's not the original use at all, sir?
it's the runoff that goes down to Stillwater.
talking about —
QUESTION:

But we're

•
In any irrigation district, isn't it that

you get a certain amount of runoff?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Yes, sir.

That's correct.

That's the reason for our concern here, that, yes,
there are the India).?,s' interests, and obviously they have
some rights.

We're not trying to do away with those rights.

40

We didn't in the Compact, as the United States agrees.

But

there's also the interest of an awful lot of other people here
that we want to make sure are also represented.
We think we, in good faith, after these negotiations,
this tremendous amount, a million and a half dollars spent on
getting this Compact.

We think we're entitled now to proceed

and if, by any chance, it doesn't work, if the lake goes down
again, they can come back; they can come back.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Walston.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK WALSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
MR. WALSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
California basically agrees with the arguments which
have been advanced by the State of Nevada, and we feel that
very basically the Pyramid Lake problem is presently being
solved by many alternative methods, at the legislative level,
the judicial level, the administrative level.
Court

And we want the

as far as California is concerned, the real basic

question between the Federal Government and the States of
California and Nevada is not really how, whether we're going
to solve the Pyramid Lake problem, but, rather, how we's
going to proceed to solve it.
Now, the Federal Task Force has come in with a

41
report,, about two years ago, and said that vast amounts of
water were being wasted in the Truck.ee River Basin by the
Federal Government's own mismanagement of its own reclamation
project, the Newlands Project.
The Task Force made a number of recommendations
whereby the Federal Government could improve the facilities
and improve the management of the system and make additional
water available for use in Pyramid Lake,

And if these

recommendations are followed and are applied, by the Federal
Government, the problem of Pyramid Lake will be solved.
Now, this same approach was taken more recently in a
lawsuit, or in a decision rendered in the Federal District
Court in Washington, D. C», Judge Gesell presiding.

This

lawsuit was brought by the Indians against the Federal
Government, the Indians claiming that the Federal Government
was violating its fiduciary obligation to the Indians by
wasting all this water in the river, and thus failing to
maximise the flow of the Truckee River into Pyramid Lake.
And Judge Gesell upheld the position of the Indians,
and he said that vast amounts of water were in fact being
wasted in the Truckee River by the mismanagement of the
Newlands Project, and he then ordered the Federal Government
to devise a regulation that will provide for salvage water,
which can go into Pyramid Lake,.

And so if Judge Gesell's

decision is implemented by the Federal Government and is

42

followed, and the water thus required to be made available to
Pyramid Lake is actually made available, again Pyramid Lake
would receive all the water it needs and the problem would be
solved.
So there would be no need for this Court, or any other
court, to really get involved with the question which is being
posed by the Federal Government in this case.
As a matter of fact, perhaps we'll find, after Judge
Gesell's decision is applied and after the Task Force
recommendations are followed, that there is in fact enough
water in the Truckee River right now to satisfy all the demands
which are being made upon itQUESTIONj

Well, then, this — assuming that nothing

that Judge Gesell ordered would be interrupted by the filing
of this lawsuit, the filing of the lawsuit might turn out to
be an unnecessary act but it wouldn't really be very bothersome,
would it?
MR. WALSTON:

I think it would, Justice White,

QUESTION: But not in terms of whether the water would
be available or not?

If Judge Gesell's orders were carried

out, as you say they could be.
MR, WALSTON:

If Judge Gesell's decision was carried

out, then Pyramid Lake would probably receive, on the average,
about 335,000 acre-feet of water per year*

And this is all

the Federal Government is really asking for on behalf of the

43

Indians in this case..
But it’s very interesting, Justice White, how Judge
Gesell's approach to the problem, and hov? the Task Force
approach to the problem really differs from the approach taken
by the Federal Government.
Judge Gesell’s approach and the Task Force approach
is based on the assumption that we have to preserve existing
water uses in the upstream area in the Truckee River Basin,
And this is diametrically opposite from the approach being
urged on this Court by the Federal Government,
Suppose, for instance, the 385,000 acre-feet of
water were flowing through the Truckee River in a very dry
year, when less than a normal amount of rainfall occurs in
the sierras, the approach taken by the Federal Government
would take the entire 385,000 acre-feet of water ar,d put it
solely for use in Pyramid Lake,

Thus there would be no water

left over for any upstream uses.
QUESTION!

They would be permitted a diversion for

the NewXands Project?
MR. WALSTON;

Not according to the prayer in the

Government’s complaint, which I believe is found at pages 14
and 15 of its complaint? they’re asking for a set minimum
yearly flow in terms of —
QUESTION;

Well, but I didn’t understand the

Solicitor General to say that that’s what they were demanding,

44
in his argument.
MR. WALSTON; Well, the Solicitor General's remarks,
I think, vary somewhat from his prayer.

If you look at his

prayer, Justice White, on pages 14 and 15, you'll find that
they’re asking for a minimum flow measured in terms of acrefeet to Pyramid Lake.
QUESTION: Well, if the solution of the problems are
so —■ I wouldn't say they are simple, but if you think Judge
Gesell has seized upon an adequate solution, it shouldn't be
very difficult, I wouldn't think, if you're right, for —
even if this suit were filed, even to arrive at a similar
result here; or to dismiss it and leave it to Judge Gesell's
decree.
MR. WALSTON:

That's possibly true, Your Honor, but

I strongly suspect that if the Court takes the case, if this
Court takes the case and proceeds to exercise its original
jurisdiction in the matter, then the whole Task Force will con®
to a halt.
QUESTION: Well, not if — I suppose, we've taken
cases in which we've specifically said we didn't intend to
interrupt a lot of other things going on in other courts, in
the same case.
MR. WALSTON:

Yes„

Well, if so, Your Honor, then

you're really, by taking the case, merely duplicating — this
is our whole point -- you’re really duplicating what Judge

45

Gesell has already found, and you're duplicating what the
Task Force has already recommended.
If the problem is actually being solved by
administrative and other judicial means, then I see no basis
or justification for this Court’s actually exercising its
discretion in the case.
QUESTION;

Has any judicial review been sought of

Judge Gesell's orders?
MR» WALSTON;

No, Justice Brennan.

I understand

that the Federal Government is not going to take an appeal
from Judge Gesell*s decision and thus, presumably, it should
Judge Gesell*s decision and thus provide Pyramid Lake
with all the water it needs.
QUESTION;

Well, your point is if we accept this

case, that enforcement of Judge Gesell's decree will stop?
is that it?
MR. WALSTON;

I frankly don't know how the Solicitor

General would respond to Judge Gesell*s decree if the Court
takas the case.
QUESTION;

Well, they're both the same party,

here's the fellow who is under Judge Gesell*s order now wants
another solution.
MR. WALSTON s
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Is that it?

There are two different groups within the

46

Department of Interior is what we’re talking about, aren’t we?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION s

That's correct,. Justice Stewart.

We * re talking about the conservation

group and we’re talking about the BIA.
MR. WALSTONs
QUESTION;

That's true.
But it’s the Secretary of Interior in

either event, isn't it?
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, that's correct. Justice White.

In other words, —
QUESTION:

Is he — he's the one who is under order,

Judge Gesell's order?
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

And he's the one who recommended the filing

of this lawsuit, if I understand?
MR, WALSTON:

The filing of the lawsuit which we're

arguing now?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALSTON:
So, in effect,

Yes, that's correct.
the Federal Government is coming

before this Court and really asking for a solution to the
problem that I think has already been found.

If the Court

applies Judge Gesell's decision, I think the problem should be
solved.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't mean if the Court applies

it, you mean if it's applied and enforced by the Secretary; is

47
that it?
MR. WALSTON;

Yes, that's correct.

QUESTION; And what you're suggesting, as I understood
you, was that if we take this case, the Secretary will not
apply Judge Gesell's order but will wait on the outcome of
this case.

Is that right?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, as I say, Justice Brennan, I'm

not sure what reaction the Solicitor General will take to
Judge Gesell's decision, if the Court takes the case.
Certainly I don't think that they will follow through with the
Task Force recommendations.
As a matter of fact, the Task Force made a number of
recommendations, and the Federal Government, I would assume,
xvould not comply with those recommendations if the Court
takes the case.
As a matter of fact, these recommendations haven't
been complied with so far.

The Federal Government is in

effect trying to implement a weather modification scheme which
the Task Force suggested, but that's the only Task Force
suggestion that's been followed by the Federal Government in
this case.
The Task Force found a number of other things the
Federal Government could do.

The Federal Government has taken

no action on those other recommendations, and i would assume
that the reason is that it prefers to seek a judicial solution

48

in this Court, in which the Winters doctrine question is
$

adjudicated.
The underlying assumption behind Judge Gesell*s
approach to the problem, and behind the Task Force approach,
is that the Federal Government itself really controls the
lion's share of water flowing through the Trucks© River.
QUESTION:

Of course Judge Gesell was limited, wasn’t

he, in that he didn’t have the water users before him, so that
that was really the only approach he could take»
MR. WALSTON: That’s the only approach he could do,
that’s right, Justice Rehnquist; but that still is sufficient,
a sufficient solution to the problem, we believe.
In other words, Judge Gesell was in effect saying
that there is a vast amount of water which is being wasted
in the reclamation project, that the Federal Government has the
power to control this waste and hase the power to eliminate the
waste.

And if it follows the suggestions of, or the order of

Judge Gesell and the Task Force and makes this water available
for use in Pyramid Lake, then the whole problem is solved,
I would remind the Court that all the parties who
are receiving water now in the Newlands Reclamation Project,
and all the other parties who are receiving water in Nevada,
and all the parties who are receiving water in California are
not before this Court, either.
QUESTION:

They weren't before Judge Gesell, either?

49
MR* WALSTON;

Mo? that's correct, Your Honor-

The

judge just had -the Federal Government before him, and he
ordered the Federal Government to adopt regulations which I
think should solve the problem.
QUESTIONs

Could they be brought into this suit?

MR. WALSTON; They could be.
could be.

I suppose that they

That raises a very interesting question*

The

Federal Government is in effect trying to have a water right
adjudicated on behalf of the Indians, and this is a water
right which would be taken out of the share of water which is
allocated to the State of Nevada.
Well, I don't see how this Court can adjudicate the
right of one water user in the Truckee River —
QUESTION;
MR. WALSTON;

Did it in Winters, didn't it?
Pardon me?

QUESTION; Did it in Winters, didn't it?

Didn't it

say that the admission of Montana did not supersede an
implied reservation of water when a Reservation was created
just a year before?
MR. WALSTON:

That's correct*

In that case, Justice

White, all the — my understanding of the case is that all the
competing water users were before the Court, and there were
the Indians before the Court, and all the other water users
were before the Court.
In this case the Federal Government is asserting a

50

water claim on behalf of the Indians in seeking to have this
Court adjudicate that water claim, even though there *s many
conflicting, or supposedly conflicting water claims in Nevada,
which deserve some consideration also.
I don’t see how this Court can really adjudicate the
water claim which is asserted by one user in the Truckee
Basin without asserting the water claims adjudicated by all
the Truckee users.
So we respectfully urge this Court to let the matter
proceed apace, and to let the decision of Judge Gesell be
implemented, and the recommendations of the Task Force be
followed.
We think that this provides a constructive solution
to the problem which will effectively preserve the rights and
the uses of the upstream water users, the people out in the
Reno area need water every year for drinking purposes, the
farmers in the Newlands Project need water for agricultural
purposes.

And Judge Gesell, I think, has pointed to a

constructive solution of the problem, and so has the Task
Force.

If they're right, the problem is solved.
So the matter, I think, is prematurely brought by

the Federal Government at this time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Walston.
Mr. Solicitor General, we've gone over a little bit
and we'.ve heard some estimates as to the impact of what might

51
happen if the relief you seek was granted, and perhaps you
could spend about three minutes enlightening us on your view
of those estimates,,

And perhaps answer some questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, the suit pending

in the District of Columbia, it was the responsibility of the
Solicitor General to decide whether an appeal should be taken,
and the decision has been made that no appeal will be taken.
Nevertheless, that case involves only the left-over,
only the runoff, only the water which does not go to someone
else by right.

It leaves — it does undertake to maximize

the left-over, and it will help the Indians; but it gives them
no right.

That water can be appropriated by somebody else.

It remains surplus water in the river, and it can be
appropriated in California, it can be appropriated in Nevada.
The only way that the Indians can be protected is by
having an adjudication that they have a right under the
Winters doctrine, as applied by this Court most recently in
Arizona v. California.
I am also advised that the Office of Management and
Budget has authorized the filing with Congress of a statement
that the Federal Government opposes the ratification of the
Compact until this question is resolved.
I would point out, too, that in the Compact itself,

52

in Article XVIII(C), it is provided that the Compact does not
deal with the rights of any parties which are not specified in
the Compact, and that was intended to leave open the question
of what would happen if there was an adjudication of the
rights of the Indians.
QUESTION:

A District Court, a Federal District

Court, or even a State Court, would have jurisdiction over
intrastate water adjudication if the United States was
noticed as to what its claimed rights might be, you would
have to enter that, to that decree.
MR, GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Under the case in Colorado, —?

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

That would be true.

That was an intra­

state stream in that case.
QUESTION:

Well, all right, with respect to the

competing claims of Newlands and Pyramid Lake, these are intra­
state claims.
MR, GRISWOLD:

With respect to the competing claims

in Newlands, these are intrastate claims; but with respect to
the claims in California, and I would point out that they are
substantial, we have filed a supplemental reply brief here
which recounts or sets out the text of an order of the State
Water Rights Board in California, which granted a substantial
additional amount out of Lake Tahoe, as saying that in that
decision the Board assumed to be surplus and unappropriated

53
the water from Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River flowing by
Derby Dam, which is not required to satisfy decreed downstream.
Indian rights, and which wastes in the Pyramid Lake,

The

only decreed rights the Indians have is 30,000 feet for
irrigation.
We are seeking here to establish decreed rights in
support, in favor of the Indians to maintain the level of
Pyramid Lake —
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Solicitor Generals

I

thought you said originally, did you not, that we would not
have to get in, or bring in these other claimants within
Nevada?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I think that is entirely right, Mr.

Justice.
QUESTION;

Well, what's your observation on that?

MR. GRISWOLDs

All this Court needs to do here is

to determine whether the Indians have a right with a priority,
and —
QUESTION:

But that would not decide, tfould it,

vis-a-vis the other claimants, those claimants' interests?
MR. GRISWOLDs

All that this Court needs to do here,

Mr. Justice, is to determine whether the Indians have a right
with a certain priority —
QUESTIONs

Well, I know, but if that priority

happens to mean that other water users in an area get half the

54
water they used to, you are foreclosing them.
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: The question is —
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

And ~
Well, I thought I understood what a

priority —
MR. GRISWOLD:

— all that they need to do is to

determine whether the Indians have a right with a certain
priority, and to allocate the waters of the stream between
California and Nevada, who appear as parens patriae and who
will represent the water users in those States, just as they
did in Arizona v. California, where exactly this was done,
in the —*
QUESTION: But that was initiated by the State, Mr#
Solicitor General.
parens patriae.

Arizona and California asserted claims of

Here you're insisting that they assert them,

even though they're defendants.
MR. GRISWOLD:

The suit was instituted by the States,

but the intervention by the United States on behalf of the
Indians was against the •— the suit was instituted by the States,
but the intervention by the United States on behalf of the
Indians was by the United States and against the States,

And

this Court adjudicated the rights, and adjudicated that the
Indians were entitled to a million acre-feet in that case.
If the Court here adjudicates that the Indians are

55

entitled to a right with a certain priority, and allocates that
between the two States, which is what it did in Arizona v,
California, then the question of allocating the water to the
individual users, which is allocated to Nevada in the one case,
can be handled in the Nevada courts, and allocation to
California users can be handled in the California courts,
QUESTIONS

But all these farmers would lose their

rights as a result of that adjudication, if it were favorable
to the Indians, without ever having had a day in this Court,
MR, GRISWOLD? They are represented by their
respective States, as has been the case in, I think I'm safe
in saying, dozens of cases involving interstate water rights
before this Court, where the States appear as parens patriae.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Thank you, Mr, Solicitor
General.
Thank you, Mr, Prettyman and Mr. Walston.
The case is submitted.
