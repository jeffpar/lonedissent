MR-, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No, 71-1422, Kaplan against California,
OEM. ARGUMENT OF STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, FLEISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Petitioner Murray Kaplan, a bookseller, has been
branded by the State of California as a criminal for selling
a book, a sexy bock, to an adult who asked for a good sexy
book,

For doing so, Mr, Kaplan has been, placed on probation

for three years on condition that he spend 30 days in jail
and that he pay a fine of a thousand dollars»
Initially I would like to point out what is not
involved in this case.

We do not have in this case any

issue of sale to or exhibit to minors.

We do not have in

this case any affront to the sensibilities of adults or anyone
else.

We have no shock.

We have no fighting words.

We

have, to put it simply, pure communication, a sale of a book
to an adult.
The facts are not in dispute at all.

On May 14,

1959, Mr. Donald Shaidell, a police officer with 16-1/2 years
of experience, came to petitioner’s bookshop-—it is an adult
bookshop,there ware some 250 of them in the City of Los
Angeles

at the time.

Mr. Shaidell was browsing around for

about 30 or 40 minutes when the petitioner said, "This is no
a library.

Can 1 help you?"
It was at that point where Mr. Shaidell said, "Do

you have any good sexy books?"
The petitioner said, "All our books are sexy."
Then he said, "I want a good paperback book.
Something really good."
The petitioner said, "Hey, I'm reading one now.
Suite 69."

And he read it, a portion of pages 84 and 85,

which I may say parenthetically are paled--the words are
paled by comparison to Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer,
found not obscene by this Court a long time ago.
After reading the passages to the officer, he
bought it for $1.95, and that is the entire transaction.
From the beginning, the petitioner here urged that
his conduct could not be punished constitutionally, that he
did not do anything that offended the state in any fashion
by selling this book to this adult under these circumstances
Our basic claim here, Your Honors, is one that has
not to my knowledge, been posed quite this way before,
although certainly we have posed it differently on other
occasions.

Our claim here is that an adult in America has

an absolute right—and I know that absolute rights are not
many, but X believe this is one of the few absolute rights
that we do have—an absolute right to read anything he wants

5
to read/ even if it has no social value, even if it appeal's
to the prurient interest of the average person, and even if
it. may be thought to be taking the offensive by others.
Q

Your client was not convicted for reading

something, was he?
MR. FLEISHMAN;

My client asserts the right to

defend the right to read, Your Honor.
derivative right.

My client claims a

We say that if in fact an adult has this

absolute right to read, then the bookseller has the right to
assert the right to read in exactly the same fashion that
Mr. Baird was given standing to assert the right of the
unmarried woman who wanted to obtain a contraceptive.

We

do not claim that petitioner bookseller has the right to sell
an obscene book.

That fact is so.

We do say, however, that

the right to read would be meaningless unless the bookslier, when he is charged criminally, can come before the
Court arid say, "This you cannot do because you are interfering
with the right of an adult to read if you punish ffls," the
bookseller who is selling to an adult.
Q

Stanley would seem, at least superficially,

to uphold the right to read.

But Raids1, on the other hand,

would indicate that that does not mean that your client has
the right to sell, would it not?
I mean, in other words, your client was not
convicted for reading anything.

MR. FLEISHMAN:

the Mr. Kaplan does not have a constitutional right to

sell an obscene book.

But I do say that the bookseller has

standing to assert the right of the reader.

There is nothing

in Reidel at all that is in conflict with that.
As a matter of fact, I believe that on a close
reading, Justice White, of Reidel, you fold vis that we did
not posit our argument correctly.

As I read it, you did

state that there was an independent right there but we had
not claimed the correct right in Reidel.

At least that is

I do not believe there is anything in

Reidel that stands in the way of our prevailing in this case.
That is all.

The result may be very close to the same.

we certainly are walking in a different door, and that is
what I am talking about at this time.
I do not think there is any way of avoiding the

only in our Constitution.

It is not

It is not only in the cases that

this Court hex-' decided on innumerable occasions.

But it is,

if you will, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which lias been with us now for some 25 years, passed in 1948.
Article 19 of that Universal Declaration of Human Rights
states that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression.

This right includes freedom to uphold opinions

without interference and to receive information and ideas
through any media.
Q

That means through any medium that is

available legally, does it not?

MR. FLEISHMAN:

It says really through any media,

which is through books, magazines, or through any
communication, as I would see it, Your Honor.
8

California is simply saying in this case that

the medium, that, i.s the store-—I am net now speaking of the
book—-the store, operating as it was operating, violates
California's law.

Is that correct?

MR. FLEISHMAN:

It does not violate California’s

statute, Mr. Chief Justice, because—

Q
statute?

What is California's claim with respect to the

MR. FLEISHMAN;

it would violate the statute if the

statute were given the broad reach that the state has
claimed for it.

What we say here, though, is that that

broad reach simply is impermissible because it does not
trench upon any state interest.

The only .-state interest that

has ever been articulated by this Court with regard to the
suppression of obscenity are really twofold.

One is the

legitimate concern with minors and the other is the
legitimate concern with the privacy of the general public
so that the general public is not shocked or offended by
obscenity because it is the fact that this kind of
communication, of very explicit sexual material, can cause
shock in very much the same way as the words in Chapiinsky
were thought, to be fighting words or in very much the same
way that the words in Boparnet

were thought to be

offensive

to the sensitivities of the persons who heard them.
But once we leave that, there simply is no state
interest in telling a person that he cannot read even an.
obscene book.

That is my understanding of what Your Honor

said in Reid el, Mr. Justice White, where, as. I read it, there
was the •statement that Stanley recognized an independent,
constitutional right, independent of the First Amendment, a
constitutional iright to read what one wants.

Whether one

talks of this in terms of the penumbras that come from the
First, the Fourth, and the Ninth or however one wants to

9

articulate it, we do think that the California just simply
does not have constitutional power to interfere as far as it
has in this case
Q

Mr. Fleishman, if we said in Roth that

obscenity as such is not protected by the First Amendment,
why need the state to show what you call a state interest if
it is dealing with what is arguably obscene?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Because,'. Your Honor, and this

really is the heart of my argument, that even though
obscenity is not speech and therefore is not protected by the
First and Fourteenth Amendments, even so an adult has the
right to read obscenity and this right to read, even
obscenity, is a fundamental personal right.

Therefore, if

the state wants to interfere with the fundamental personal
right to read even an obscene book, then the state must show
a compelling reason.
Q

Then you are saying that what we said in Roth

is not entirely correct, that if a person has a right to read
an obscene book, presumably that right stems from the First
Amendment as incorporating by the Fourteenth.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Not entirely.

I think that is what

Mr. Justice White was teaching me, at least, in Reidel, that
there is a right to read but it is not a First Amendment right
to read.

And, therefore, it is an independently saved right.

There axe certain things—for example, I suppose I have the

10
fundamental constitutional right to go about and enjoy a
sunset, to enjoy that; that is a. fundamental right that 2
have»

That is not a First Amendment right.

It is a

personal right that comes to me as a human being in terms of
the importance of living.

And the state simply cannot

interfere with that right without showing some legitimate
state interest, and the legitimate state interest must be a
compelling interest where you have fundamental rights at
stake.

Q

Would you require every single exercise of the

state police power to be justified on that score?

Supposing

the state decides to build on land that it owns a large
freeway that obscures your view of the sunset from your
backyard.

Would you say that the state has to show a

compelling state interest to cut off that view?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

No, no.

I think this is the

distinction that was drawn in Griswold, the distinction that
was drawn in Baird.

It is the distinction that is present

in Stanley fend it is the distinction we claim here, that there
are personal fundamental rights that simply stand on a higher
footing than merely economic rights
do not come into this same level.

.or social rights which
When you said in Griswold

that there is. a right of privacy, marital privacy, which is
fundamental and the state can only intrude in that in a
limited area and upon the showing of a compelling interest.

11
it was because there was a finding that that situation was of
great importance in a free society.

1 am saying that the

right to read, the right to think, and all that is embodied
in that is fundamental to a free society.

You simply cannot

have a democratic society without giving and recognising the
importance of a right to read anything that an adult wants to
read.

Once we agree that that is a fundamental personal

right, which is on a different footing than the land case
that Your Honor

was talking about, then I say that the state

has to come in and show something, Why, for what reason, can
the state come in and say that an adult cannot exercise that
right? And they simply have not done it here.

So, it tends

to justify—not only do not make a compelling case, they do
not even make a rational case.
Q

Mr. Fleishman, you have got me confused again.

Are we dealing in this case with the right of the reader or
the right of a seller?
MR. FLEISHMAN;

We are dealing with the right of

petitioner to assert the right of the reader in precisely the
same way, Your Honor, that Mr. Baird was given standing to
assert the right of the unmarried woman who wanted to obtain
a contraceptive.

In that case, the right belonged to the

unmarried woman, but the person who asserted the right was
Mr. Baird, who had given it to her.

Now, in this case, the

right that I claim, the constitutional right that is inherent

12

here in this case is the adult person's right to read.

So,

the bookseller, the person who makes that right meaningful,
is in a position to assert that right.

He has standing.

He

has standing for better reasons than Baird was given standing
in the Baird case, because in Baird the Court said that unless
Mr. Baird could assert the right that was involved, the right
would fall into disrepute, it would wither away.
In our case, in California, there is no time of
reading an obscene book.

Therefore, there would never be a

situation where the adult could assert—he would have no
forum in which to assert his right.

And, under those

circumstances, this Court has said that the third party rule,
the rule of

certain

should be relaxed.

third party rights, can be relaxed and

And that is exactly what we are here.

We do hot say—and X want to repeat it—we do not say that
the bookseller has an independent right to distribute an
obscene book.

Roth has said no, Reidel has said no, and we

accept those propositions here.

But that does not mean that

a bookseller can be sent to jail for doing nothing more than
engaging in a transaction which is absolutely protected.
That is to say, letting an adult obtain a book which he has
an absolute right to read.
Then, Mr. Fleishman, your case stands or fall
on the issue of standing, I take it?
MR. FLEISKMAHs

On this aspect of the case, that is

13
true.

Before leaving the Court, please, I would like to

point out that as 1 understand it, every member of the Court
really has accepted the right of the adult to read obscenity
privately.

If I -understand Rosenfeld correctly, Mr. Justice

Powell there stated that our free society had to be flexible
enough to permit adults to engage their tastes, which would
include obscene talk privately.

The condition was that that

obscene talk not be such as to intrude upon those who are
unwilling to engage in this kind of talk.

But inherent in

and explicitly stated in Rosenfeld was that there was the
right of individuals to exercise their own tastes in this
way.

It is something we all know,- this distinction between

the public and the private.

A joke' which is perfectly

proper—-it may be an obscene joke—perfectly proper in a
fraternity house or in & looker room is perfectly improper
whan it is in a pulpit or perhaps in this Courtroom because it
becomes an offense.

But if you have the situation which we

have in this case where there is simply no offense to anyone,
then so far as this aspect of the case .is concerned, there is
the actual right to read which then does depend on standing,
as Your Honor did state before.
But there ere other aspects to the case which do not
depend on standing.

First of all, once we leave the first

point, we believe that the book is not obscene under the
variable obscenity test even if it meets the three-pronged

14
test set forth by this Court in Memoirs«

That is to say, a

book which sold to a consenting adult under controlled
circumstances such as we have here simply is not taking the
offensive, because it is one thing if you have a mass mailing
such as was involved in Roth in the first instance or in
again in Ginsberg-—there, because it goes out indiscriminately,
it is going to be offensive to large numbers of persons.

And

then you do have to ask the question, Is it patently
offensive to this large group of people who are exposed to it?
But it is irrelevant, it seems to me when you have a
situation where if I choose to buy the book and read the
book and it does not offend me, then it does not matter that
that same book would offend most other people.

The other

people don't buy it, don't read it, and therefore whether it
does or does not offend them is simply irrelevant.

The same

thing is true with regard to the appeal to the prurient
interest.

The appeal to the prurient interest of the average

person makes sense when you have again a widespread
distribution to a large number of persons.

You have to then

stripe the group that is concerned.
But when you have a private transaction, such as
you have here, it simply does not matter that it may appeal
to the prurient interest, of the average parson if it does not
appeal to the prurient interest of the person who reads it.
This is only the other side, really, of Michigan.

In

15
Michigan Your Honor stated that it was proper to adjust the
testf depending upon the audience for whom it is prepared
and primarily distributed to.

And there material which would

have been perhaps not obscene, if it was to the average
person, was found to be obscene because it was geared for a
particular group where it would have a particular impact.
am looking at the other side of that coin.

I

If all we have

are consenting adults, people who are not offended, people
who do not have their prurient interest appealed to by the
reading of this, people for whom it does have valuef even
if it would not have

value generally, then that book to that

person under those circumstances simply is not obscene.
For that argument, Mr. Justice .Biaekraun, of course,
we do not require to go on a standing.

That is an

independent right, because the bookseller has an independent
right to sell the book now because on this argument the book
is not obscene under a variable obscenity test.
Q

When you speak of variable obscenity tests,

am 1 right in understanding that you mean just to capsulis:©
the argument you just made; is that it?
MR. FLEISHMANs

Yes, Your Honor.

That is, talk in

terms of the audience and the context.
Q

Right.

MR. FLEISHMAN:

Exactly.

The third part of the argument, insofar as this is

16
concerned is that.. aside frcm everything else, if we forget
the variable obscenity test, if we could get the right to
read, this book simply is not obscene under cases already
decided by this Court.
It has no picturas.

The book, after all, is words alone.

In terms of the words used, they surely

are no stronger, no softer, than the words that were in
Henry Miller's book and in Portnoy\s Complaint and all around
us, as far as that is concerned.
descriptions that are there.

And, in terms of the

There comes a time, I respect­

fully submit, that there is nothing new that you can say
about the subject, and that time has simply come and gone.
So that in every aspect of the case, the book, it seems to me,
cannot be the basis of a criminal conviction such as was
involved here.
1 would like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal„

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARD G. McCONNELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. McCONNELLs

May it please the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice:
It seems to me that all petitioner wants in this
case is that this Court should scuttle Roth, 15 years of

17
cases following Roth, including Reidel, including Thirty-Seven
Photographs, which is less than a year and & half since they
were decided»
Petitioner perceives something in Stanley v„ Georgia
which this Court has held already does not exist.

His

arguments have already been presented to the California
Supreme Court in People v* Lures, and they considered his
argument to be highly concatenated.

If I understand him

correctly, he is saying, number one, it is all right to sell
obscenity to a consenting adult.

Number two, if you sell it

to a consenting adult, it is not obscene.

And, number three,

he asserts that Roth is still the law of the land, that
obscenity is still not protected.
challenge Roth.

He says he does not

To me this is somewhat confusing.

There are some facts in this case which
Mr. Fleishman did not stress which I feel should be stressed.
I think the conversation in the bookstore between the officer
and petitioner was a little more involved than what
Mr. Fleishman has stated here.

It is all covered in detail

in the brief.
I think this case is unusual in the sense that
commercial exploitation exists in this case to a much greater
degree, at least in the record, than it has in other cases.
I think it is invalid for Mr. Fleishman to argue in this
Court that obscenity today in the United States is not being

18

thrust on an unwilling public.

The fact of the matter is

that the public is complaining.

The public did complain,

referring to the record, about Mr. Kaplan and that is why the
police went there.

At the time this case arose, there were

some 250—-1 call them dirty bookstores»
to call them adult bookstores, okay.
City of Los Angeles alone.

If Mr. Fleishman wants

There are 250 in the

There just are not enough

policemen assigned to vice squads to cover dirty bookstores
in all the other parts of their assignments for them to go
around aggressively enforcing laws against pornography.

And

the record shows the only reason they went to Mr. Kaplan’s
bookstore was because they had received complaints from the
public and complaints from the government of the people to
whom the public had complained.
Q

Does Los Angeles have any special squad or a

special mechanism to try to keep minors and other children
out of these stores?
MR. McConnell:

Not for that specific purpose.

They

do have a special squad within their organization that does
work on nothing but pornography, but it's just a handful of
men.

I believe there are no more than about six or eight

men assigned to that.

And most of their time is taken up

with conducting a survey in the state to determine
contemporary community standards.

There is no legal method

in California wherein the police can do anything other than

19

use ike statute before this Court to keep the public from
being offended by the pornographic booksellers.
Q

Is that group especially trained for

pornographic literature or literature generally?
HR,. McCONNELLs

For the most part , they are

especially trained—the few that work on them would be
specially trained for pornographic literature to some extent.
It depends on what you mean by special training»
they call the administrative vice division.

It is what

There are 17 vice

divisions geographically in Los Angeles, and then there is
an administrative vice division.

And these !asnr among their

duties, supervise and train the other vice officers in the

kinds of vice.

They work in all

But there would be just a handful that would

be assigned to pornography.
In this case, for instance,, the witness Blackwell
would be one of these men,, and the record reflects what kind
of training is fairly typical for these men.

At the present

time# one of the men., I believe, is a psychologist.

It just

happens to be that he is a policeman who is a psychologist.

•HER. McCONNELL s

It was not gone into in great

detail on the record, but people were complaining that

20

obscene books were being sold from this bookstore.
Q

Does the record show that these were being

displayed to people, passers-by?
MR. McCONNELL:

The record only reflects that the

complaint had been turned over fco.Sargeant Shaidell, and he
was assigned to investigate to see if there was any
substance to the complaint.
Q

The record just does not show what the

complaint was about, does it?
MR. McCONNELL:

He stated, as I recall, that there

had been complaints from citizens that Mr. Kaplan was selling
obscene books.
Q

Showing them to unwilling—

MR. McCONNELLs
from his store.

No, just selling obscene books

The record does not show to whom he was

selling them.
Q

Does the record indicate what the surrounding

environment was of the store?

Was it a place that purveyed

to juveniles and displayed to people who were not interested
or were offended by this?

Is this not at pages 44 and 45? “Did you

information before you went into the store as to

Mr. Murray Kaplan being employed at the store or working at
the store?
"Yes»
“Where did you get that information?
"I think I got it from two different sources.

I

thinkj, number one, at Administrative Vice we were checking on
different locations known as adult-type bookstores and who
the owner was, through licensing.

I also checked with West

there, if he was actually working as well as being the
proprietor of the location."
Is that not

about all there is?

MR. McCONNELL:

No, I recall more than that.

I

think it was on page 38 of the transcript.
Q

Well, don’t waste your time.

MR. McCONNELL:

Here it is.

He said the purpose

was to investigate citizens' complaints regarding obscene
matter being sold at that location and then later on either
voire dire or cross-examination it was brought out that the
complaints came to him via a city councilman's office and
the people had complained to the city councilman.
;;

Going on with this point, I think it is interesting

to note that in the Los Angeles Times, Sunday past, there

23
was an article apparently in Denmark that the people are
sorry that they have gone ahead and allowed the public
distribution of pornography there because it has become the
kind of nuisance that there is a danger of it becoming here
in the United States and in California and in Los Angeles
in particular.
Mr. Fleishman's theory on its face 1 think has
some sort of validity; that is, it would seem reasonable that
one could control sales to minors.
of a chilling effect.

There is a possibility

There is a possibility of a prior

restraint, though, if the state attempts to license book­
stores and police them in the same manner that it does with
alcohol.

Of course, with alcohol you can never have a problem

with prior restraint.
The reason the theory does not work is very simply
that if an adult goes into a liquor store and buys a bottle
of bourbon, he certainly is not going to give it away to
children and most times he is not even going to give it away
to other adults.

He is buying it to consume himself.

Once

he has drunk it all up, it is gone and he throws away an
empty bottle.

It is not the same thing with pornography.

It does not self-destruct in five seconds and it is not
bio-degradable.

It simply sits there until he throws it in

his trash and then he has the problems of redistribution.
There are controls now in the area of pornography.

You do

24
not. have much of a redistribution problem.

I anticipate

that Mr. Fleishman—he mentioned Butler v. Michigan, and I
do not want anybody to think I am implying that that is bad
law, 1 think it is good law, but still in all it bears to
the validity of his argument that it should be okay if
petitioner does not sell it to children,because the fact of
the matter is that if you have wider distribution, that means
wider distribution everywhere eventually.
The other factual area in this case that was
important to me was the fact that petitioner was exploiting
his material.

Ha sold the police on two different occasions

three different types of material—a film, a photo magazine,
and a book.
complaint.

Petitioner was charged with all three in one
He was tried in one case, and the jury was shown

was Mr. Fleishman calls comparables.

In the case of Suite 69

an entire book called Adam and Eve, held not obscene by this
Court in Hoyt v. Minnesota, was read to the jury.

The jury

was instructed that they should consider the fact that this
Court held Adam and Eve to be not. obscene in considering
whether or not Suite 6jJ was obscene.

And the jury considering

all of the different comparables and all of the factors in
the case, acquitted petitioner of selling an obscene movie
or selling an obscene photo magazine and yet held, based on
what they had heard, that the book is obscene.
The manner in which petitioner and other

25

pornography peddlers in this country are showing their
materials these days I think speaks volumes for social value.
And X would question whether a jury trial has the validity
in an abscenity case if the petitioner can eventually come
to this Court and say, "Well* the jury having all the benefit
of all of that testimony in evidence should now be overruled
because of some different standard. ,f
If Stanley v. Georgia has any meaning, if Heidel
and Thirty-Seven Photographs has any meaning and if they
mean what Mr. Fleishman says they mean, then I am truly
confounded.

I think the basic rule of Roth is still good.

I am frankly surprised that a case such as Stanley v. Georgia
ever had to come to this Court.

It would seem to me that any

sixth grade child would have told the police in Georgia
that you cannot control a man's thoughts, and he would not
have had to base it on the Constitution.
I do not. think—-and I submit that this Court should
not think so either—that because there is any right to
think and an absolute right to read what you want in the
privacy of your own home, that that, means there is the right
to sell pornography.

And there is not any logical connection

between Stanley's right to read and petitioner's right, on
the other hand, to conduct a public merchandising of the
material that Stanley might want to read.
simply do not abridge Stanley.

Roth and Reidel

26
1 do not believe that the birth control cases are
controlling in this case either.

In the birth control cases

Griswold and Pisanstadi, the Court was dealing with
dissemination of ideas and information which the public at
large thoroughly attaches great social value to,

Pornography

simply is not a matter that so fundamentally affects the
people in this country as decisions of whether or not. they
should bear children.
What petitioner is saying in this case essentially
is that the Court should throw out Roth.

He is saying that

Roth was wrong when it said there was no need for the state
to show a clear and present danger based on any compelling
state interest.

And he says that this Court has limited the

state to only two areas in Stanley v. Georgia..

The Court

gave two examples of Stanley v. Georgia but did not place
any limit on what this compelling state interest may be, if
any.

And I think it. is up to the legislature, net the courts,

to determine if these, interests exist and, if

bo,

what they

are.
I would point out that accepting the petitioner's
theory in this case would place a burden on the prosecution
the same as it is now and would be involved with the issues
of whether pornography was being sold to children or unconsetting adults, and I suggest that this flies in the face of
Ginsbergy. New York and Butler v. Michigan.

27
Some other issues that ware raised in petitioner’s
brief I would like to address very briefly.

Number one is

the question of the national standards versus state standards
or other local standards.

7. see no compelling reason why

the states should be denied local control over all aspects of
obscenity, and 1 see no compelling reason why a national
standard

of contemporary community standards should apply,
Q

Suppose the compelling reason is that it

is

a national constitution, is it not?
MR. McCCNNELLs

It is true, it is a national

constitution but—
Q

Unless one were to adopt the view expressed

by 1 think only two members of this Court in modern times>
Mr. Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice Harlan, that the
Fourteenth Amendment does not fully incorporate the First
Amendment against state action; then, because it is a
national constitution nationwide that determines what is
speech and what is press-™
MR. McCCNNELL:

It is correct that it is a national

constitution and that is really the only argument for a
national standard.
Q

That is a pretty good one, is it not?

MR. McCONNELLs

Yes, it is.

The question is,

though, suppose the national standard were to be applied.
In California today contemporary community standards have to

20
be proven by expert testimony, and the way this is most
commonly done is by having the police department continuously
conduct a poll which we maintain is scientifically' accurate
of the entire state of California.

They do this every six

months and they ask people, "What are the standards in your
community?”

And when they come into court and they set these

scores, does it not stand to reason the California standards
are essentially similar or more liberal than the national
standard?

Why should prosecution be put to the burden of

trying to prove this sort of thing over the entire nation?
It has been questioned in this Court before whether or not
there is such a thing as a national standard and, if so,
whether it is too elusive to determine.

I think that it could

foe established by expert testimony in a California court
that national standards of tolerance in the areas of nudity
or sex might be set by a book such as The Sensuous Woman or
by Si magazine such as Playboy»

But anything beyond that

would offend national standards, at least in California,
Q

I cXii talking about what offends and what is

protected by the national federal Constitution, the
Constitution of the United States, which has the seme meaning
in every state unlessf as 1 say, you are pressing to us the
view taken by Mr, Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice Harlan
:hat. the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the First
amendment.

Are you pressing that view?

29
MR. McCONNELL2
Q

No, X would not—

It is a very, very respected view, held by very

fine members of this Court.

But 1 think they are the only

two in modern times.
MR. McCONNELL%

The view that X have is the Court

in Roth defined obscenity and it merely said goes beyond
contemporary community standards.
Q

Are you suggesting, Mr. McConnell, that the

very use of the terra t!community standards” in Roth may have
suggested something other than a national standard?
MR. McCONNELLs

used the word "community,” what did they mean?

If they

Obviously,

if it is a national standard, then there is a better way to
phrase it than saying "contemporary community standards."
Q

Did not Mr. Chief Justice Warren, when he was

sitting, say precisely that?
MR. McCONNELL:

Yea, he did. And X submit that if

you, on the one hand, make the community to© small, then you
have a situation analogous to Butler v. Michigan where you are
reducing what people can read to a. very limited sort of
audience.

If you are going to make it a nationwide standard,

then petitioner also has a valid logical complaint, and that
is that he is doing business in Los Angeles, a community of
some—well, the metropolitan area--of some ten. million people.

30

and standards that apply in Duluth, Minnesota or Yakima,
Washington or- wherever all have an effect on how he is going

view, could convict a bookseller, if that was the communitystandard , of selling the works of Karl Marx or the

That is the community by which-—
Q

And the Constitution would have nothing to say

if a community decided that the publications of the John
Birch Society were obscene and convicted somebody for
selling it?
MR. McCGNNELLs

No, because I would assume that

the publications of the John Birch Society would not appeal
to prurient interests.
Q

Why is that so different?

What so different

about that constitutionally?
MR. McCQNNELLs

I am not sure I understand the

question, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Q

I am not sure I understand your argument, and

1 arc trying to test it.
MR. McCONNELL:

The argument is simply that there

is no logical reason to me why it is more fair to somebody

31

such as petitioner to say that community standards in the
nation as a whole have to be determined.

This Court has

never answered the question up till now which standard should
apply.

And 1 would assume that perhaps it wishes to answer

the question in this term.

If it does, then some of the

points that I think the Court should consider are, number one,
What did the Court, mean previously when it used the word
"community"?
of very

MR. McCONNBLs

Ho, it can make the community too

small or it can make-—
Q

The community thinks that is offensive and

obscene, that particular book.
MR. McCONHELL:

No, I do not think so,.. , 2 think the

community, if it is too small or too large, either way, is
an .analogous situation to Butler v. Michigan;

you then have

the petitioner in the standpoint of having to gear what he
sayr, to the standards of a very limited audience or in a very
limited way.

In essence, the national standard argument is

all tied in with the Stanley- v. Georgia argument because

32
what Mr. Fleishman was saying a few moments ago is that the
pruriency and so on should be judged by the intended
recipient, by a consenting adult.
Q

Where was that in Stanley?

MR. McCONNELL:
Q

Where was that point in Stanley?

MR. McCONNELLs
Q

Did that point come up in Stanley?

National standards.

MR. McCONNELL?
Q

I beg your pardon?

No.

In Mr. Fleishman's argument, sir?

You said that was in Stanley.

I just want

to know where it is in Stanley.
MR. McCONNELL?

If I did, then it. was the wrong

words that came out of my mouth.
Q

Mr. Fleishman—

On this standard, suppose that California

unanimously objects to people reading

:Suite 69.

Could they

stop a man from reading it?

MR. McCONNELL%

No, no, no, of course not.

But

Roth says and Reidel says that the State of California can
stop petitioner from selling it as standard.
Q

Could they stop a man from going door to door

with a magazine in a plain package and selling it?
MR. McCONNELL:

I do not know the practicalities of

trying to sell somebody a brown wrapped package.

They would

have to know what was inside before they would take it.'
A man is standing on a corner and a man comes

33
up and says „ "Do you know where 1 could find a sexy hook?1'

And that

To be perfectly

frank, the only way that these cases arise is when the

Q

Is there one iota of that in this record in

Los Angeles?
MR. MCCONNELLs
Q

No.

This record—

So far this record just shows somebody had to

go in there voluntarily and find out that he was selling
dirty books.
MR. McCONKELLs
true, yes.

According to this record, that is

But I think under Stanley, under Reidel, it does

not make any difference that the police had to gc find out.
That is how they make fcheir case.

The fact that the police

bought the book does not have anything to do with the fact
that

he might have been a consenting adult.

It has

something to do with the search and seizure law.

If the

police buy the book, that is how they obtain their evidence
and that is hew they obtain the fact—
Q

you mean the policeman was not a consenting

adult?
MR. McCONNELL:

Not in the sense that

Mr. Fleishman was talking about.

M. KcCONHKiLs

Q

No.

The seller assumed he was? that

But I do not believe—
This is the man you convicted, the seller.

He

assumed that this was a man that wanted to see a dirty book.
MR. McCONNELL:
Q

That is right.

And he accommodated him.

MR. McCOMKEiL•

That is right.

Just briefly, if I

may, I think that the obscenity of Suite 69 is clear from
reading it and the jury's judgment here is based on
comparable evidence which this Court had considered previously.
It is obviously different from other books. It Is charade
that the community standards could not be violated because
nothing can go further.

To say the book is not obscene is to

say that no book without pictures—in other words, novel-type
book—could be obscene and that there are no community
standards.
It would be nice for Mr. Fleishman and for myself
if this Court could decide whether social importance is an
element that the prosecution has to prove as far as its case
or whether or not it' is just part of the definition as stated
in Roth.

It seems to rae that Roth created somewhat of a

36
presumption that if the other elements of obscenity were
met, then social value is presumed not to exist.

The

California courtf the court below, interpreted that not to
be the law

and foil wed the minority opinion in Memoirs in

A Book v,. Attorney General, as it also followed the so-called
gambling aspects of that book.

I submit that if this Court

could say that a book such as Fanny Hill might be considered
obscene under certain circumstances of sale, then certainly
that book, being very tame compared to Suite 69, then
certainly Suite 69, under the circumstances under which it
was sold, does have to be considered obscene.
I think that this really is not a question of
pandering.

The court below did not talk about Ginsberg.

talked about A Bock v. Attorney General.

It

Ginsberg could not

he convicted under California law because you cannot prove
the other elements of obscenity by the statements of the
seller?

yon can only prove social value that way.
I think that the opinion of the court below shows

that they did not rely on the California statute.

Because

this Court thinks they did, I would point out that its
appearance is, to me at least, that of a rule of evidence
that codifies the law that was set forth in opinions coming
from this Court long before petitioner was arrested.

And it

did become effective as a statute in Los Angeles quite a long
time before he was actually tried.

It" did not change any

Therefore, I would submit under the facts of

this case that the judgment should be affirmed,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Fleishman..

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
Mr. Fleishman, may I ask you a question before

Q
you commence.

Would you extend the fundamental personal

right to read to a similar right to view photographs and
moving pictures?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Yes, sir, I would.

they stand on exactly the same footing.

X think that

The right to get

information, whether one gets it by words or by picture,
stands on the same footing, Mr. Justice Powell, in my opinion.
I think that the colloquy that Justice Marshall
had with Mr. McConnell points the direction, as I see it, to
the solution in the case.

Mr. McConnell said that as he

walked down Washington, somebody tried to hustle him into
a bookstore and there was no such similar hustling that
appeared in the case at bar.

There is nothing in the record

at all along those lines.
What we have suggested in our papers—and X think
it is wise and I think it follows the opinions mostly of you,
V’

Mr. Justice White, as X understand them—and that is that a
statute can be good or bad, depending upon the record that it
has mad®.

That is my understanding of Baird.

In that case

38
it was not the statute that Your Honor was focusing on so
much as proof in the case®

Since the state was claiming that

there was a health hazard*, then Your Honor quite properly said,
"Where is there any record that this film was relevant to the
health hazard?"
There again are only two things that the state
talked about in this case or any obscenity cases,
talks

Mr, McConnell

about minors and he talks about an obtrusive kind of

distribution.
conviction.

Minors essentially cannot be the basis of the
1 suppose it is true that if there are books

that are on the market generally, that some of these books will
ultimately find their way to minors in the same way that if
you have automobiles on the road, I suppose that minors are
from time to time going to drive those automobiles.

And in

the same way if you have cigarettes being sold, minors are
going to smoke cigarettes.
But Reidel told us—it was reinforced in Roth and
it has been restated at every opportunity this Court has had
an opportunity to talk about the subject--that you cannot
limit what adults are going to read because we are saying
that it is inappropriate for minors.

So that in this case,

for Mr. McConnell to argue that to follow the argument that
we huve suggested would mean that there is a greater likeli­

hood that minors will get books, simply does not meet the
constitutional issue.

39
Q

Mr. Fleishman, under your theory, which is then

the right of the reader rather than of the seller, I take it
that the state may limit a seventeen year old’s right to read

in a way that it cannot limit an adult's right to read?
MR. FLEISHMAN?

The Court has so held in Ginsberg

against Mew York , and we do not—
Q

But. there the theory was selling and purveying

rather than the right to read.
MR. FLEISHMAN?

Not quite...

As 1 read Justice

Brennan's ©pinion, it was there stated that the right of the
minor to read did not stand

at as high a footing as the

right of an adult and, therefore7 since it was not on the
same footing, the right of the minor could be interfered with
on a showing of rationality.
It is true that that was a bookseller who was
convicted.

But the Court did talk about the right of a minor

in that situation, and ha did not have—the minor did not
have the same rights.

It is what I understand Mr. Justice

Stewart was saying in that opinion, saying it is one thing
to say that the Constitution protects absolutely the right
of an adult to read, because he is a thinking person? but
that a minor, on a theory that he does not have the thinking
processes yet, it is kind of like an involuntary thrusting
upon a person who is not full—
Q

The same rationale that limits a minor’s right

40
to vote„
MS, FLEISHMANs

Exactly„ exactly»

So that my

argument does not in any way touch the Ginsberg against New
York argument, Mr» Justice Rehnquist.
Q

In order to reach that result we would have to

combine voting rights with First Amendment to get that
analogy»

The First Amendment says nothing about age limits

or minors»
MR. FLEISHMANt

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

this Court on a number of occasions has already taken the
step in terms of saying that the right of a minor is not as
great as the right of an adult.

Your Honors did that, of

course, in the Prince case in the beginning, came back
again in Ginsberg, and it came up in a fashion, X suppose,
in the Yoder ease, Wisconsin
Q

against Yoder.

Are you saying the states have a certain

amount of latitude in determining this, that California might
say age 17 and New Hampshire might say age 20, just as they
can on contract liability?
MR. FLEISHMAN:

There is certainly some latitude.

I don't think that I would accept 20.

I think 'that since a

person can vote at 3.8, I think that whenever you go above
3.8 you are going to get into a question of rationality.

But

certainly the state does have a right to have a different
test for minors.

And

1 might add that in California we do

41
have a minors statute»

In California, if in fact there were

a sale to minors, there is a specific statute which would
control that situation»
The other aspect of the case that Mr» McConnell
raises is—on®, as I say, is minors and that certainly will
not do it»

And the other is that if you have a rule such as

we are arguing for that there may be, it may end up in an
obtrusive thrusting upon an unwilling audience, the simple
answer to that is, when that time comes the State of California
is absolutely free to charge a person, put on proof of that
and to convict him for thrusting it upon an unwilling
audience»

We do not ask in this case that the statute be

touched at all»

All we say is and all we argue for is that

the state has simply gone too far,' it has infringed upon a
constitutional right when it has punished Mr» Kaplan for­
doing no more than selling the book under these circumstances.
There are one or two other things that I would
like to touch upon, if I may, in the brief time still
remaining.

Mr. McConnell says of course Griswold and Baird

stand on the high ground that discussion about birth
control is very important, very fundamental, and of course
the state cannot interfere with that.

And than ha says in a

way that I do not quite understand that sex somehow is not
important.

People somehow are not interested in sex, as I

hear Mr. McConnell*s argument.

42
The simple fact is that people are enormously
interested in the subject..

If there is one thing that we

know, it is that the people buy books dealing with sex.,very
explicit bookso

They look at films of this kind.

derive a great deal of value from it.

And they

The Commission on

Obscenity and Pornography spent some two years engaged in an
enormous amount of original research? it engaged in a great
deal of scientific survey taking in berms of who reads sexy
books, why do they read them, what do they get out of them,
and they have concluded that the people who read them are,
for the most part, middle aged, middle-class, white people
who read them and derive a great deal of pleasure, information,
and satisfaction from reading this.
*

It therefore seems to me to be inappropriate and
wrong to make an argument that Griswold and Baird were
correctly decided because there the discussion was about
contraceptives and whether or not on® would have children
but at the same time that a book,, a magazine, which deals
with sex, explicit sexual material, somehow is without social
value.

It is not the fact, and I believe that the commission

studies and our whole history has taught us that there is in
fact value in books such as Suite 69, even if the values do
not seem clear to all of us.

Thank you very much,

Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
