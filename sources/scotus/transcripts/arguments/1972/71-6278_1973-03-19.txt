proceedings
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

in Sanchez against the United States, No. 71-6278.
Mr. Chanoux, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. CHANOUX, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHANOUX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may the Court

please s
The question involved in this case revolves around
whether petitioner's constitutional rights under the Fourth
Amendment were violated in reference to a search and seizure
of some marihuana which was found in a car driven by the
petitioner.
It is the contention of petitioner that these rights
were violated.

The government contends that the search was

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, in that it was done by
officers of the Border Patrol of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service; and that the search of petitioner's
car was for aliens.
The Immigration and Naturalization Act has a section
authorizing warrantless searches of vehicles for aliens.
QUESTION: What would be your position if he had
found an illegal alien under the back seat?
MR. CHANOUX:
Your Honor.

I feel that the issue would be the same,

I do not feel that this would be constitutional

4
in —
QUESTION: Well, I thought you were making some
distinction there.
MR. CHANOUX:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

No, I do not feel that there is a distinction as to
whether they were searching for contraband or searching for
an alien.

It is petitioner's contention that, at the least,

the Court should set guidelines or bring the searches for
illegal aliens, or the searches of vehicles for illegal
aliens, in line with the Customs searches of vehicles for
contraband.
Petitioner does not feel that the Customs Services'
hands have been tied by the safeguards implemented by the
courts in order to give judicial sanction to certain facts.
Petitioner does not feel that in this particular
set of facts, and this case was, or this motion was decided
on a stipulated set of facts; it is not felt that it would be
necessary to find that probable cause, per se, existed to
search the car for an illegal alien, but, rather, that in a
search under cases similar to Alexander and

Weil, if the

Court had reasonable suspicion, reasonable certainty that the
car being searched did have an illegal alien, then it would be
possible for the search to be justified under the statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Chanoux,

to sustain that position of

yours, we would have to hold the statute unconstitutional,

5
wouldn’t we?
MR. CHAOUX:
yes.

That is ray — my contention, Your Honor,

It would be possible to hold the regulation in question

unconstitutional.

I feel that would be begging the question.

We would left with a standard that 100 miles might not be
reasonable, but the courts and officers would be left with.,
again, the statute or the subsection, stating that within a
reasonable distance of the border,

I do not feel that 100

miles is any religious, you know, reason for stating that
100 miles should be the safeguard; 75, 50; the Attorney General
could have posssibly stated three miles or three minutes.
Possibly some safeguard is necessary.
But I do not feel that there is any magic involved
in the hundred-mile limit set by —
QUESTIONS

What is the constitutional difference

between three miles and 100 miles, in your view?

You now

indicate that three miles might be reasonable,
MR. CIIANOUXs

No.

I again, Your Honor, do not feel

that there is any, you know, greater constitutional safeguards
involved in a three-mile limit as opposed to 100-mile limit.
QUESTIONj Then you wouldn’t allow any distance away
from the border?
MR. CIIANOUXs

Possibly certain distances might be

determined to be reasonable.
QUESTIONS Well, fifty yards?

HR. CHANOUX:

I would hate to see the situation

where somebody could cross "an international boundary line”
and then thumb his nose at the -- [coughing]

excuse me, if

the Court please — thumb his nose at the border officers.
And sort of show them that he had some illegal contraband, or
have recently smuggled some.
QUESTION: Well, how about a nonstop airplane flight
from Mexico City to Chicago?

Certainly a search for contraband

or for aliens to take place in Chicago, could it not?
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Counsel seems to be ill*
Would you help him, officers?
Just let counsel sit down, and we'll — just relax —
MR. CHANOUX:

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mrs. McGuire up.

Perhaps you should call

We'll just ~

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

That's his wife.

Let his

wife help him.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, I think what

we'll do is to take a five or ten-minute recess until the
nurse can arrive here.
[Whereupon, at 1:37 o'clock, p.ra., a recess was
taken for the purpose of assisting counsel? case was
continued to a later date.]
