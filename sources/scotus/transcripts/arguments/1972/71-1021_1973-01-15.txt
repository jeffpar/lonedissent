PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-1021, Employees against the Department of
Public Health and Welfare.
Mr. Zwerdling, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. L. ZWEEDLXNG, SSQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ZWERDLXNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We arc here on certiorari from a five-four decision
of the 8th Circuit, granting motion to dismiss a complaint
filed by employees of the State of Missouri.
They sue for time and one-half overtime pay, an
additional equal amount as liquidated damages,and reasonable
counsel fees, as provided for in the Fair Labor Standards Act,
known as the Wage Hour Law.
That act was amended in 1966 to apply to such State
employees.
Complaint was filed in Federal District Court in
1969, alleging violation of the overtime provisions, commencing
in 1967, in February of that year, and continuing thereafter.
The 1966 amendments to the Act, under which these
employees of State schools and hospitals sue, was held to be
a proper exercise of the Congressional power under the Commerce

4
Clause lui Maryland r. Uirfcs by this Court.
And the case today presents the quest ion, which ?:,io
expressly reserved in dryland

v.

Uirfcs, aa unnecessary to

decision there?of whether employees may sue in Federal court
to enforce rights given them by the 1966 amendments.
Me submit that Congress intended to permit such
employee suits against the States for violation of the act,
and that Congress had the power under the.Commerce Clause to
so provide, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.
The Congressional intent is clear.
16(b) of that Act provides, and 1 quote:

The statute, in

”Any employer who

violates the provisions of Section 6 or Section 7”

-- those

are the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions -- ’’any
employer who so violates the provisions of this Act, shall be
liable to the employees affected in the amount of their unpaid
minimum wages or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the
case may be, and an additional equal amount as liquidated
damages.

Action to recover such liability may be maintained

in any court of competent jurisdiction.”
In.Section (b), the language so states.
How, the term "employed which is used in that section
is defined, in Section 3 of the act.
Ubat those amendments in 1966 did was to expand this
definition to bring under the statute as employers, within the
meaning of that section, the States and their political

5
subdivisions, 'with respect to certain institutions, schools
and hospitals.
Prior to that year of the amendments, the section
saidid"Employers shall not include the United States or any
State or political subdivision of a State,” but when they
added the amendatory language, Congress specifically injected
a removal of that exclusion of the States from the definition
by inserting the language in 1966, quote, "except with respect
to employees of a State or political subdivision thereof
employed in a hospital, institution or school referred to
in the last sentence of Subsection (r) of this section."
And so Congress chose explicitly to remove this
. previously excluded category, and the subsection to which it
refers in this definition is the definition of the word
"enterprise."
Here, Congress added to the list of covered
enterprises the operation of a hospital, institution or
school, and once again in those amendments Congress underlined
its express intention by adding these words, quote, 'Regardless
of whether or not such hospital, institution or school is
public or private or operated for profit or not for profit."
Nothing could be clearer or more explicit.
And, again, in the next subsection which speaks of
the definition of enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce, Congress added the same

6

language, once again stressing, quote, *’regardless of whether
or not such hospital, institution or school is public or
private -88
The remedy of the employees* suit in Section 16(b)
has existed in the statute since it was enacted in 1938.
It reaches the States here because it says, -.%ny employer- who
violates these sections shall be subject to such suite.”
And by expanding that definition of employer, thus,
this remedy comes into play.
Q

Do I understand that if there is a recovery it

is automatic that the recovery be a double recovery?
MR, ZWERDLING:

That is explicit in Section 16(b).

It says, quote, "And in an additional equal amount as
liquidated damages.”
Q

And is the law clear that there is no discretion in

the trial court?
MR* ZWE&DLIHG:
Honor.

There is acme discretion, Your

But the purpose of that liquidated damages is it is

instead of interest.

It is for purposes of certainty in

setting forth damages.
Q

I know the purpose, but I wondered and I am asking

for information, is the law clear or is it not that when there
is a recovery the recovery has to be a double recovery?
MR. ZVJERDLIMGi

There is discretion in the courts

to reduce it under some circumstances, Your Honor.

7
Q

Is that clear in the law?
MR. ZWERDLING:

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And how about the provision further down in

Section (b), the court in such action shall, in addition to
any judgment awarded, allow a reasonable attorneys' fee to be
paid.
That's, of course, in addition to the double
recovery.
MR. ZWERDLING:

Yes, Your Honor, and costs of the

action.
Q

i And costs.

And what is the law as to whether or

not there is any discretion?
MR. ZWEKDLIKG:

I understand that there is

discretion and the specific section is Section 60, that is
it is 260 of 29 U.S. Code.
Q

Is that, do you know, in the Appendis: to your

brief ?
MR. ZWERDLING:

That section is not in the Appendix,

Your Honor.
Q

I was asking, as I say, for information, because

I didn't know how automatic this statutory language had been
held to be.

It sounds as though there is no discretion.

MR. StJERDLIHO:

In the brief of the court below,

there is citation of that section on page 11-A of the white
document which is a petition for certiorari, Your Honor, which

says, quote, quoting the court, "Under Sec tiers 260, Remission
of liquidated damages in whole or in part is only allowable'’
quoting the statute now, "if the employer shows to the
satisfaction of the court: that the act or omission giving rise
to such, action was in good faith and that he had reasonable
grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act that was shaded."
Tiie court goes on, "and even if the required showing
is made, the remission is left to the sound discretion of the
court."
Q

And there is nothing there about attorneys’ fees?
I®. ZWEEDLING:

Q

No, Your Honor.

That discussion could he exercised with respect to

erroneous evaluation of the law, for example?

If you are

correct in your case here, would the judgment of'the State of
Missouri which is in disagreement with yours, be the kind
of factor that would allow the court to exercise that
discretion?
MR. ZWERDLIHG:

As to whether or not Congress had

exerted its jurisdiction through exercise of the Commerce
Clause, Your Honor?
Q

Oh, no, on double ■»- the same subject Justice

Stewart has been pursuing with you.

On the double damages,

on the penalty.
MR. ZWERDLIHG:

Yes, X believe there would be that

9
discretion.
Q

After Maryland v, Ulrta. you would wonder if

Missouri could say that it had reasonable grounds for
believing that its act was not a violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938.
MR. ZWERDLIHG:

Then I misunderstood the question.

If the question addresses itself to whether there is dis­
cretion to be exercised by the court in reviewing whether or
not the State exercised the waiver, that is something that is
dealt with, as I would point out, and as was pointed out in
the brief, in the decision of the court in which it is made
clear that that waiver occurs by virtue of continuing to
operate, and that that waiver need be neither knowing nor
intelligent, to use the citation by the dissent, in that case,
of what the court held.
In the case to which we refer, in the Pardon case,
which is the case which is key to the problem before us, in
that case which was Parden v. Alabama Terminal Railroad, that
was a case that was decided in 1964 in which the court had
before it the Federal Employer Liability Act.
And in that case as here, there was the question
of private employees* suit to enforce the rights under that
statute.
And there the court held that by virtue of fee
fact that the statute enacted by Congress in the exercise of

10
its commerce power, as was the case here in the exercise
by Congress of its cosaaerce power here in dealing with the
Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.
la the Pardon case, which involved the Federal
Employers Liability Act, which is the act under which
employees can sue for redress for damage to the employee and
injury on the railroad.
In that case, involving a railroad, which was State
owned railroad at the docks of Alabama, the court held that
the Commerce Clause enabled Congress to act in this manner to
provide that private employee remedy

that lawsuit as a

.

means of remedy, and the court held that this occurred by
virtue

of the continuing operation of that railroad.
How, the same principal applying here —

*

Q

This is one of those businesses States didn't usually

engage in, wasn't it, the railroad business?
MR. ZWERDLIHG:

As to whether it is usually engaged

in, Your Honor, I do not believe that is a distinction that
the courts have held to make the constitutional difference.
That discussion has occurred by this Court in two cases
involving the State of California, which we discussed in our
brief, and in the Farden case and numerous other cases in
which the question — I think Your Honor is alluding to
Q

You say the waiver doesn't need even to be voluntary?

It may not need to be intelligent, but does it have to be

11
voluntary to be a waiver at all, or -MEL ZWERDLXMG:

Well, it is voluntary in the

sense that, as here, the State of Missouri was well aware of
the fact that in the case of Maryland v. Wirta, in which the
validity of the Wage Hour Law amendments here before the
Court was dealt with expressly as to their constitutionality

■ Q

This doesn't have much »- see, a State might have

a choice about whether to engage in the railroad business,
but it doesn’t have much choice about whether it is going to
conduct certain

operations or to -- it doesn’t have much

choice about whether it is going to run a mental hospital,
probably.
ME. ZWERDLIHG:

Well, X think Your Honor is alluding

to what we are familiar with as the ancient argument as to
proprietary versus governmental powers -Q

I didn't mention it.

You brought those words up,

I didn't. X just said that a State doesn’t have much choice
about whether it is going to run a mental hospital.

Does it,

or not?
MR. ZWERDLING:

I presume that a State doesn't have

much choice as to whether it is going to run a mental hospital,
Q

So its price for running a mental hospital is to

waive its constitutional right to immunity under the Eleventh
Amendment, is that it?

12

MR* ZWERDLING:

When Congress enacts this kind of

a statute under the commerce power» which is plenary, unlike
the Federal taxing power, Commerce can lay down,under the .
commerce power, the conditions for operation in reference to
anything that affects commerce.
And that is what Congress did in this case.
That is what was upheld in Maryland v. Wirf:;;.
That is what was dealt with in Maryland v. Uirta,
which involved the very State which is before us today, among
other States, the State of Missouri.
The State of Missouri was on notice when that decision
was handed down in 1968 that Commerce in the exercise of its
plenary power under the Commerce Clause,

had determined that

the problem of labor disputes, the problem of maintaining -of eliminating unfair competition between the States and the
effects on commerce, was best dealt with by that enactment in
its wisdom, and it so acted.

And the court so upheld the

action of Congress in Maryland v. Wirts.
As I say, that case involved not only the State of
Maryland, but the State of Missouri.
It was ruled upon.

They were a party to it.

Theycontinued to operate thereafter.

They were on full knowledge of the situation.
But as the majority held in the garden case, such
waiver need be neither knowing nor intelligent.

The point is

it is a matter of plenary power of Congress, under the commerce

13
power.
Q

What you are saying, in effect, is that under the

Eleventh -Amendment, the governmental function aspect of the
activity is irrelevant?
MR. 2WE1DLIKG:

As to the distinction between

governmental and proprietary, and if I may now allude to those
words, Mr. Chief Justice, Maryland v. Wirts said, quote,
"In the first place, it is clear that the Federal Government
when acting within a delegated power may override counter­
vailing State interests whether these be described as
governmental or proprietary in character.”
That was disposed of many times before.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Indian Towing cases
which involved a waiver of immunity question, said, quote,
"There is nothing in the Torte Claims Act which was involved
there which shows that Congress intended to draw distinctions
so fine-spun and capricious,” to use the words of the Court,
through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, "as to be almost incapable
of being held in mind for adequate formulation.95
And, again, in the Rayonier case, Rayonier, Inc.
v. United States, the court said, "We expressly decided,in
Indian Towing.that an injured party cannot be deprived of his
rights under the Act by resorting to an alleged distinction
imported from the Law of Municipal Corporations between the
Government’s negligence when it acts in a proprietary capacity,

and its negligence when it acts in a uniquely governmental
capacity,*'
Q

Is there reference to what the State tradit onallf did

as a State and the State entering into Easiness?
MR. ZWERDLIHG:

There is reference to that just as

in contrast in the Sanitary Pis trie ir. case, which I thought
Your Honor had in mind, there is reference to the overriding
commerce power enabling the Congress to prevent the State
from taking water from Lake Michigan which was essential to
its inhabitants, because it was in contravention of an enactment
by the State by the United States in connection with a
commerce power.
Q

But that wasn't authorising any private individual

to sue the State, was it?
MR, ZWERDLING:

Ho, and that old not involve a private

suit.
garden, which is the governing case here, we
believe, Parden v. Alabama Terminal Railway, did so involve
private suit.
And in that case, this Court upheld the, specifically
ruled on this very question of the immunity of the States
from private suit, and held that that immunity did not fasten
to the extent of precluding the exercise of the commerce
power to enable this private suit which has its purpose not
siaiply to help the individual, as such, but, more importantly,

15
as has been pointed out by the courts, including garden,
the purpose of enforcement of the statute of enabling what
could not otherwise occur by the Government, the enforcement
of this exercise of commerce power -**
Q

The State operation of a railroad is no different

than a State operation of a mental hospital?
MR. ZWERDL1NG:

It depends, Your Honor, on whether

one is a mental patient or one who is involved in railroad
operation.
I don't mean to be facetious.

Whether it is

essential or not, and one fixes on mental hospitals, this
statute embraces much more than mental hospitals.

It involves

hospitals, institutions which exist in the private sector
as well as the public sector, and its function is, as stated
to, by eliminating the differential between what must bo paid
over 40 hours, time and one-half, and what must be paid
minimum wage, for a public employee as opposed to a private
employee, by eliminating the unfair competition against
private industry by that enactment*
Q

You do agree that the State has the constitutional

right to immunity from suits by its own citizens or citizens
of other States?
MR. ZWERDLING:

We believe it is totally unnecessary

here for purposes of this suit to -■» of this case --to
challenge the Eleventh Amendment interpretation, that Is right,

16
Your Honor.
Q

Well, that wasn’t Eleventh Amendment interpretation,

was it?
MR. ZWERDL1NG:
Q

'Hois y. Louisiana.

I didn’t think that was to interpret the Eleventh

Amendment.
MR* ZWERDLIEG:
Q

I believe it is. Your Honor.

I thought it said there was a constitutional right

to immunity.
MR. ZWERDLING:

By virtue of the Constitution,

other than the Eleventh Amendment, Your Honor?
Q

Yes.
You do agree there is a constitutional right in the

State to immunity suit?
MR. ZWERDLING:

When it does not collide with a

plenary power of Congress over the commerce power, Your Honor.
Q

Well, the Congress could certainly

»** the Issue

here isn’t whether Congress can impose wage and hour conditions
on the State,

The issue is whether the private individuals

can sue the State to enforce it.

Congress can’t legislate

away the constitutional immunity just by saying it doesn’t
exist.
Q

As far as Federal constitutional immunity goes,

isn’t it applicable only in Federal courts?
MR. ZWERDLIMG:

This statute, Your Honor?

17
Q

No, no, the Federal constitutional immunity of

a sovereign State from suit is applicable only in Federal
courts.
MR. ZWERDL1NG:
Q

That’s right.

Can a private individual enforce

does the statute

prevent these suits from being brought in State courts?
MR. ZWERDLING:

No, Your Honor.

May I say what Mr, Justice hhite wrote in United
States v. California, I am sorry in the Pardon case, in which
statement was made on behalf of the minority, quote, and this
was on behalf of the minority, "I agree that it is within the
power of Congress to condition a State’s permit to engage
in the interstate transportation business ” which is what was
involved there, "on a waiver of the State’s sovereign im­
munity from suits arising out of such business,

Congress

might well determine that allowing regulable conduct, such
as the operation of a railroad to be undertaken by a body
legally immune from liability directly resulting from these
operations, is so inimicable to the purposes of its regulation,
that the State must be put to the option of either foregoing
participation in the conduct or consenting to legal respon­
sibility for injury caused thereby.*’
Q

Cases involving a railroad.
MR. ZWERDLING:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would like to reserve the balance of my time, if

18

there are no further questions.
Q

And I spoke in dissent.
MR. ZWERDLING:

Yes, Your Honor, as I pointed out.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF 'LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The petitioners here are non-professional employees
of State hospitals and of a State school in Missouri.

Their

complaint,which was dismissed, does not specify their citizen­
ship, but presumably they are also citizens of Missouri, and
the suit, therefore, dees not come within the literal terras
of the Eleventh Amendment.
The protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act
were extended to these employees in 196b amendments to the
act which this Court upheld as constitutional in Maryland v.
Wirts.
And they are seeking here to sue their employers in
Federal court for unpaid overtime compensation.
As Mr. Zwerdiing ably pointed out at the beginning
of his argument, on their face, the remedial provisions they
invoke under the act apply to these employees and their
employers just as they do to any others covered by the act.
And so the question presented is whether

19
constitutional con siderat io sis,

none

the less, require that

this category of employees be discriminated against, by being
denied a remedy against their employers provided by Congress
and available to all others within the act’s coverage.
The answer, in our view, is to be found by putting
together this Court’s decision in Maryland v, Uirta with its
prior decision in Parden v, Terminal Railway.
What Parden holds is that where a State engages in
activities that are validly subject to Congressional regu­
lation under the Commerce Clause, it is subject to that
regulation as fully as if it were a private person or a
corporation.
And specifically, the Congress can in effect
condition the State’s continued participation in the regu­
la ted activity on constructive consent to be sued under the
Federal Regulatory Statute.
And, Maryland v, Wirtz, of course, adds to this,
that the activities involved here are activities that are
validly subject to Congressional regulation under the
Commerce Clause,
It seems to us that these cases have developed that
as the relevant test, rather than the old distinctions that
were attempted to be drawn between governmental and proprietary
functions, or what might be called essential functions or
traditional functions.

20

Q

The question is whether you can reasonably say the

State has waived9 isn’t that the basic question, Mr, Wallace?
MEL. WALLACE:

Q

Isn't that what Pardon was all about?
MR. WALLACE:

a waiver,
opinion.

Q

Well, the defense said that it was

I don't think that word was used in the court's
It really amounted to a constructive consent.
It's a condition.
MR. WALLACE:

Q

Well, —

It’s a condition.

If you want to do this, you have to do that, so —
MR. WALLACE:

Congress has undertaken to regulate

the activities in this field whether performed by a State or
by a business,

and undertake them evenhandedly, and has

notified the State that if they continue to engage in this
.

f-

'1 •

activity they are subject to the same Federal regulation
that the business enterprises also engaging in this activity
are subject to.
And by continuing to engage in the activity, the
State constructively consents to be cued, therefore.
That is what the court —
Q
consented.

That's what it is all about, is whether it is
We

reasonably said to have consented to suit in

the Federal court.
MR, WALLACE:

That is correct, Your Honor, by

engaging in the activity.

21
Indeed, we think Chat in two important respects
this case really follows a fortiori from garden.
First, the FELA, which was the statute at issue in
Parden, made no reference to State owned railroads.

It

merely said that "every common carrier by railroad while
engaging in commerce" is liable to injured employees and
subject to suit,
And the court there had to decide whether this
general language should be construed to include State owned
railroads.
A majority held that it should, although four
dissenting justices were of the view that Congress should
speak more specifically in order to subject States to suit
if they engage in activity subject to regulation under the
Commerce Clause.
And here, Congress has explicitly amended a series
of definitional provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act
to make the act’s provisions apply.
Q

Would you say that Parden is basically a con­

stitutional holding?
MR. WALLACE:

The court was unanimously of the view

in Parden that Congress had the constitutional power to
impose, in effect, this constructive consent on the State’s
activity, but was divided 5 to 4 on whether Congress had in
fact done so.

22
Sos it was both a constitutional and a statutory
decision.

The court was unanimous on its constitutional

holding, but divided 5 to 4 on the statutory construction.
There is no question but under this act the State
has been put on notice, which was the query raised in the
dissent in garden.

It has been put on notice that the pro­

visions apply to it and it has been put on notice that it
surely is subject to suit if it violates them by withholding
the wages that are due, surely subject to suit by the Secre tar
and or# the face of the act, also subject to suit by the
employees as well.
So
Q

Remedies in a suit by the Secretary are what?

An injunction,

He can enjoin.

He can get recovery of single

wages, is that it?
MR, WALLACE:

Of the single wages without interest

and without consequential damages of any kind.
In the ordinary suit brought by the employee,to
fully compensate him, Congress has provided for liquidated
damages —
Q

Double recovery, plus interest, plus attorneys1 fees
MR. WALLACE:

It's not plus interest, Your Honor.

It's in lieu of interest and in lieu of consequential damages.
Q

Plus attorneys' fees.
MR. WALLACE:

Plus attorneys' fees.

Otherwise,

23

many or these suits- X doubt; would be in court, because
many of them are for relatively small suras of money.
I understand the argument,

Q

X am just asking for

information.
«

If the Secretary does move in, then the wage
earner's lawsuit is displaced, is that right?

Do I remember

correctly?
MR, WALLACE:

That is correct, in those instances

where the Secretary sues.
The court long ago held that the liquidated damages
provision is compensatory in nature, that there are many
consequential damages suffered by wage earners in low pay
categories, such as the nonprofessional employees of hospitals
and schools Involved here.

There are many consequential

damages from withheld wages which are difficult to ascertain,
and in lieu of either interest or consequential damages, this
is the measure of compensation.
Q

What happens when the Secretary recovers money?

Is that payable immediately to the employees?
MR, WALLACE:

That is turned over to the employee,

the recovery, yes.
Q

Just that much?
MR, WALLACE:

the withheld wages.

Just that much.

Just the amount of

So that, in effect, the judgment against

the employer in that case is nothing but what he should have

paid -Q

All along.
I1®.. WALLACE:

All along, sometime earlier.

And he

has had the use of the money in the interim.
Wow, there is another important respect in which
this case, in our view, follows a fortiori from Fardor.
. Here, the substantive requirements of the act
clearly apply to these State employers, and the only question
is whether, in the context of State employment,this sub­
stantive right should be separated from the statutory remedy
provided for employees.
In our view, even if this kind of divorce of rights
from remedies might be plausible in interpreting some statutes,
it is particularly inappropriate with respect to the Fair
Labor Standards Act, because under the Fair Labor Standards
Act, the remedy is not merely compensatory as it is in most
statutes, including the FELA, which was involved in Farden,
but the remedy itself also accomplishes an important part of
the regulatory objective that Congress had.
Since one of the principal purposes of the act is
to insure that some employers do not gain an unfair advantage
over their competitors by paying substandard wages. That is
why

this Court has said that Section 16(b) of the act involved

here has both a public and a private character, that it is both
compensatory and an enforcement provision.

25

And3 significantly, the Senate report on the 1966
amendments specifically said that one of the purposes of
extending the act to cover these State run institutions was
to bring about a competitive equality with similar activities
carried on by business enterprises,
We have the quote,on page 17 of our brief, from
the report.
They were attempting to follow through on Che act's
original basic purpose of eliminating unfair methods of
competition in commerce.
Q

Does that mean that you are telling us Chafe the

operation of a mental hospital or a university by a State is
unfair competition against private universities and private
hospitals?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, this was the view Congress

took.
Q

I am asking you if you think that -«•
MR. WALLACE:

I think that there is a rational

basis for concluding that in many instances they are
competing with privately run enterprises, and Congress felt
it was unfair for the privately run enterprise to have to
comply with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act
and to have competing services made available by State in­
stitutions at lower cost to users of those services partly
because low paid nonprofessional personnel were being paid

26

substandard wages.
This was one of the conclusions Congress case to
in enacting the amendments that this Court upheld in Maryland
v. Wirfca.
Another basic purpose of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, recited in the act itself, was to avoid labor disputes
that interfere with commerce.
Congress wanted to take these controversies about
substandard wages and overtime compensation out of the streets
and into the courts.
Yet, what could be more calculated to lead to
labor strife than a holding that employees whose Federalstatutory rights have been violated are to be denied
judicial remedy.
So in this respect, too, the remedy here is an
integral part of the regulatory objective.

It is not merely

compensatory and not merely designed to encourage compliance
with the act, as are most remedies in statutes.
Of course, it also does encourage compliance and
thereby furthers the act's other objectives, such as reducing
unemployment, by encouraging employers to hire more people
rather than to work their employees at overtime.
This is one of the basic objectives of the act and
it is of continuing importance with our persistent unemployment.
How, the fact that the Secretary of Labor is also

27
empowered to bring enforcement: suits here, which will not
fully compensate the employees, does not, in our view, call
for a different result than in Farden because of the vast
numbers of employees in establishments covered by the act,
the Secretary is unable to bring suits except in a small
proportion of the cases in which violations occur.
Indeed, the Secretary is not staffed even to be
able to investigate all possible violations, let alone to
bring suit against all the violations that occur.
Of necessity, the Secretary's limited staff of
50 attorneys in 13 regional offices must concentrate their
efforts on cases that involve the greatest public interest.
From the beginning, Congress decided to provide a
private remedy in the act, rather than to create the vast
Federal bureaucracy that would otherwise be required, if
enforcement were to be entirely in the hands of the Secretary.
Q

How much of that bureaucracy would you need if you

allocated this enforcement just with respect to the States?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, of the covered employees,

2.7 million of them are in these covered State institutions,
and this involves 118,000 such institutions.
So it is a substantial part.

Altogether, we are

talking about 2 million establishments and 45 million
employees, but it is still a very substantial figure, and the
problem would be very much exacerbated, Mr. Justice, by the

28
same issue which arises under 1972 amendments to the Fair
Labor Standards Act, which extends coverage of the Equal Pay
for Equal Work Regardless of Sex provisions to professional
employees in these covered institutions, including the State
institutions.
Those are cases that tend to involve special facts
tint have to be developed with regard to the particular
individuals covered and whether their work is comparable to
somebody else’s work.
They are quite time-consuming lawsuits, and in many
instances of employees denied compensation you have timeconsuming factual problems to be developed in the suits.
There is little doubt

but what the Secretary could

not bring suit on behalf of all who would be entitled to
recovery, and the Secretary would then be in a very awkward
position when his refusal to bring suit would constitute
a final denial of a remedy in particular cases, and there is
no reason to believe that Congress intended to give the
Secretary that kind of essentially unreviewable authority
over the rights of individuals protected by this act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, Mr. B lac lunar.

29
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALLEN BLACKMAR, ESQ. ,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BLACKMAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I think X would discuss, first of all, what is not

at issue in this case, the way the State of Missouri views the
case.
First, there is no question that Congress has the
power to include State schools and hospitals under the
definition of employer found in the Fair Labor Standards Act,
and there is no doubt that Congress has done so, that is,
Maryland v. Hirta and the 1966 Amendment to the act.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that Missouri has
an obligation to obey the act.
And, looking at the Parden case, we do not dispute
the fact that Congress has power to require Missouri to waive
its constitutional immunity from suit as a condition to
entering into activities where Congress has regulated the
activities pursuant to its commerce power, if Congress so
provides.
And, finally, there is no question presented by
this case as to whether a State court would be required to
hear at action brought under 216(b) — or 16(b) -*> by a
private employee, whether that would be required either by
Federal constitutional law or by Missouri law.

30
Q

Do X understand that you concede that an action such

as this could be brought in a State court?
MR. BLACKMAR:

No, Your Honor.

I am saying that

that question is not presented by this case.

I do not

concede that in this case, although X think there are very
persuasive arguments that certainly could be made that the
State court would, under the — Article 6 of the Constitution,
where it is required to enforce the Federal laws, have a duty
to hear such a case,
Q

And you do concede, or do you, that so. far as the

Federal Constitution goes, with its protection of State
sovereign immunity, that protection extends only to Federal
court actions?

Certainly, the, terms of the Eleventh Amendment

talk in terns of extending the power of the Federal courts.
MR, BLACKMAR:

Whether we speak in terns of the

Eleventh Amendment or the basic constitutional principle
recognized in the Hans case, that that was not the Eleventh
Amendment, we would suggest that it only applies to the
Federal courts.
What is at issue is one narrow question, that is,
whether the remedies provided a private employee by 16(b)
were intended by Congress to be available to such employees
against the State of Missouri,
Now, in 1933 *•Q

' (inaudible)

31
i-JR. BLACKMAR:

That8s precisely it, Your Honor.

I feel vjg have to concede the rightj on the basis
of both the minority and majority, in the Pardon case which
recognized that Congress dees have a power to require the
State to waive its consent to suit as a condition to entering
activities regulated by Congress, and the Maryland v. Wirta
case which holds that Congress has the power to regulate
wages in schools -Q

You say the only issue then is whether Congress,

in fact, required Missouri to enter?
MR. BLACKIiAR:

Yea, Your Honor, that is Missouri’s

position.
In 1936, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was
initially passed, States were excluded from coverage of the
act.
In 1966, an exception to that exclusion was written
into the act in the case of State schools and hospitals.
The act has four remedy provisions.
First of all, there are criminal sanctions, in
Section 16(a),
Secondly, the Secretary of Labor, by Section 16(c),
is authorised £o file suit,when requested by employees on
behalf of the employees, to recover wages that have not been
paid to them.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume right

32
there after lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 ©‘clock, noon, the oral
argument was recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock,
p.m.9 the same day.)

33
AFTER33QOH SSSSIOM
(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue,

Mr. Blackraar.
MR. BLACKM&R:

Mr. Chief Justice and members of

the Court:
We were discussing the four remedies that Centre or:
lias provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act,
We mentioned the first was a criminal sanction
under Section 16(a).
Secondly, there is the suit by the Secretary of
Labor, when the employees requested him to maintain a suit,
where he may recover unpaid wages on behalf of the employees,
which he ultimately will turn over to the employees.
Q

Does he do that only on request?
MR. BLACKMAR:

This is a suit under 16(c).

Mow, there is a remedy under Section 17, that's
the third remedy, where the Secretary of Labor may seek an
injunction against the employer, and,as part of his equitable
relief,request restitution of unpaid wages.
It would seem that Section 17 lias pretty much
eliminated Section 16(b) as an effective remedy by the
Secretary of Labor because he can dp more under that section
with fewer restraints than he can under Section 16(b).
Section 16(b) hasa provision that he may not bring

an action when there is a novel legal question undecided by
the courts.

That restraint is not found in Section 17.

And finally, the remedy of Section 16(b)

and if

I said 16(b) before, I meant 16(c) -- Section 16(1.) allows
private individuals to sue their employers to recover their
unpaid compensation, an equal amount as liquidated damages.
The terra "liquidated damages" are the words'that
Congress has used,and reasonable attorneys’ fees.
Q

You are talking here only about 16(c)?
MR* BLACKMAR:

Only 16(c).

This is the only situation where the employer is
required to pay more than has been withheld illegally.
Again, to the question presented in this case,
and specifically and expressly left unanswered by the Maryland
v. Wirta question, and the question is, did the inclusion of
State employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act automatic­
ally result in an intention that Congress would make appli­
cable the 16(b) remedies,of private suit against the State,
to such employees?
Really, the question is, did Congress destroy the
State's constitutional immunity from suit in this area?
We

note that there is not one word in the Fair Labor

Standards Act itself, or the 1966 amendments» that indicates
that a State is subject to suit by private individuals, not­
withstanding its constitutional immunity.

It has often been observed that the Federal courts
are courts of limited jurisdiction.
How, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not, in
itself, confer jurisdiction to hoar a case arising from the
act in the Federal courts.
Jurisdiction is conferred by 28 USC, Soc. 1339,
which is a jurisdiction statute,

that deals with an act of

Congress regulating commerce. That is the jurisdictional
section that the plaintiffs below brought this case, under.
How, it has been held by this Court that the mere
fact that there is a Federal question in a case does not mean
that the States are subject to suit by private individuals in
the Federal courts, and we would submit that since the basic
Federal question, jurisdictional statute, is little different
except for jurisdiction araount, than the jurisdiction statute
that is involved in cases of Congress -- cases arising out of
Acts of Congress, regulating Congress, that it can be argued,
and should be argued, that Congress has not intended in one
way, to any degree, to change the State's basic position,
which is that they are immune from suit in the Federal courts.
Q

Mow is it argued in Parden?
HR* BLAGKMAR:

Well, Parden, Section 56 of the FELA,

specifically allowed the employee to maintain an action in
the Federal courts.
I would submit that that is a jurisdictional —

36

Q

That is an expression of Congressional intent that

is not present in this case?
MR. BLACKMAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the jurisdiction that I think not only shows
an intent on Congress -Q

Yes, but doesn't 16(b) permit the employee to sue?.
MR. BLACKMAR:

In a court of competent jurisdiction,

and the Federal courts are not courts of competent jurisdictio:,
Q

Unless they are otherwise competent.
••

•

MR. BLACKMAR:

• «-->

Unless the State has consented to

suit, and that's the Eleventh Amendment in the Constitutional
principle of Sovereign Immunity.
Mow, the Pardon case
Q

~~

The employees are practically without remedy?
MR. BLACKMAR:

I don't think that that is certainly

the situation in Missouri.

As our*brief indicates, the

Secretary of Labor has filed an action under Section 17
against the State of Missouri.
That action included some two or three thousand
employees, and they have been successful in that action, and
the State has, as a matter of fact,

had an appropriation to

pay those employees and it has paid those employees,
Q

That's not Congress’ action, as I understand ifc.
This private action was in order to get enforcement

sufficient for the employees, am I right?

37
MR, BLACKMR:

To have futuro enforcement?

Although the court declined injunction and to
recover past unpaid compensation.
Q

That was the purpose of 6(e),

That was the purpose

of that section, am X right?
MR, BLACKMR:

The purpose of Section 16(b) was

to permit private actions by the employees.
The suit I am talking about -Q

Isn’t that just as valid if the State is or is a

private person?
MR. BLACKMR:
Q

Pardon me.

Isn’t that just as valid to protect the employee

of a State as it is necessary to protect the employee of a
private employer ?
MR. BLACKMARf

Well.

Except that there has been

a traditional principle that the States are immune from
suit in the Federal courts.
Q

Why did Congress leave it?
MR. BLACKMR:

Section 16(c)?

Well, because it would have

application.
16(c) is the section that permits the Secretary
of labor to bring suit.
Q

Well, whichever section involves, allows the

private employee **“ what section is that?
MR. BLACKMR:

That’s 16(b).

38
Q

That'8 what 1 thought.
Wader 16(b), is it just as necessary for the

employee, working for the State, as it is for an employee
working for private individual?
Ml, BLACKMAR:

I don't know.

I would think that

there are different considerations between public employeat
and private employment.
I think, for one thing, that you have a single
entity that is generally inclined to obey the law, that is
generally not engaged in competition,, and as soon as it can
administratively solve the problems that exist in complying
with the Fair Labor Standards Act is reasonable, and it has
been our experience in Missouri that it lias.
It seems to me that there are special incentives,
possibly to private employer^ to violate the act.
Q

Mo need to bring the State under it, was there?
MR, BLACKMAR:

Well, Congress has brought some

activities of the State under the act, but I think that the
congressional purposes, in so doing, can be fully vindicated
without finding that Congress intended that the State waive
its immunity from suit.
And that is the proposition that I am arguing to
the Court today.
Congress did not say that a State would lose its
immunity as a condition of continuing to operate State schools

39

and hospitals, after it became covered with respect to those
activities.
And I submit that it is not reasonable to infer
that that was the Congressional intention,
Q

The Solicitor General’s brief, mentioned in the

argument, indicated that about 95% of all the employees
covered b" the Act are private, truly private employees, and
perhaps 4 or 5%, more or les3, are public.
Do you quarrel with that figure?
MR. BLACKMAR:

I would think that would be o

reasonable estimate,
Q

From your point of view, the only tiling supporting,

governing the Solicitor General’s view, and his friend, is
that it is more convenient to let the private —■ the employees
sue in a private suit rather than have the Secretary sue for
them,
MR. BLACKMAR:

That appears to be the Solicitor

General's argument, and I thought he had advanced a rather
novel proposition, which was,because of the limited staff
•N •

available in the Solicitor of Labor's office, that Congress
must not have intended that they would be the sole vehicle
by which the act could be enforced against the State.
As a matter of fact, the Department of Labor has
sued Missouri, and has sued, to my knpwledge, at least 10
other States to recover unpaid overtime compensation.

40
I think that in this area that one or two suits
against the State pretty much forces the State into compliance.
And when that is done, the State gives its employees what
they have coming under the act.
Since there are only 50 States, X think sooner or
later if any State persisto in disobeying the Act, that it
will be compelled,by the remedies available under the Act,
to comply,whether it likes it or not, and may not fee particu­
larly difficult for the Secretary of Labor to maintain such
suits.
Pardon recognises that a State must consent to suit.
.

1-,-V

And the court, in that case, went on to find and Alabama
when it commenced operation of a railroad, twenty years after
the FELA was enacted, necessarily consented to such suit.
In this case, we would have to ask when did Missouri
consent?

Did it consent when Congress passed the Act and the

Act became effective?
Did it consent after Maryland v. flirts was decided?
Or was it some other date at which it consented.
It is known and recognised by the court below
that Missouri operated schools and hospitals prior to the
effective date of the 1966 amendments.
At some point, according to the argvsoents advanced
by the petitioners, Missouri must have consented to the Act.
But I do not see how you can say that a State

41
continuing activities that it has historically engaged in,
and which have been recognised as functions of State
government, consented to waive its Constitutional immunity
from suit in the Federal courts.
Certainly, the Act did not advise Missouri in
express language that it was going to have to make what
the district court in Idaho

has termed a ’’Eobeson choice7'

of either foregoing fee operation of its schools and hospitals
before consenting to suit by private individuals in the Federal
court.
Congress, very easily could have provided an
express waiver provision, where it would advise the States
that they would lose this immunity, but it has not done so.
And that leads me to three factors which the Court
below distinguished this case from garden,

I think each of

these factors are very important in considering the question
of what did Congress intend when it made the State subject
to the Act.
First of all, there is the very nature of schools
and hospitals.

They are traditionally activities States

engage in.
Considering the nature of those activities, is it
reasonable to infer that Congress would intend that an
employee would recover double before the State were to
expend funds on the care of the patients,or the students, of

42
the institutions covered?
And, of course, there is the fact that there are
double damages and attorneys’ fees that are available to the
private employees, if they are permitted to maintain the
suit.
It does not seem, again, that Congress would intend
that this type of remedy be available against the State.
I think that there are more -- at least it is a
policy judgment that should be made expressly and not found
by a court on the basis of silence.
And, finally, the court -•»
Q

Would you make that argument, that there was

a suit brought under the Act in the State court?

MR. BLACKM&R:
argument.
Q

I would consider making that

I don't know.
It would be very difficult for you to do so,

wouldn’t it?

MR. BLACKMAR:

It would be very difficult to argue

that if the State court had jurisdiction that the provisions
of the Act did not apply.
And, as I mentioned earlier, I am not necessarily
conceding
Q

—
So your argument really is, should be, whether

the Congress intended to make the remedy available in the
%

Federal court?

43

MIL BLACKMAR:
Q

Well, the argument — yes,

Rather than at all.
MR. BLACKMAR:

This goes to the fact that there

are the double damages, X think, goes fco the intent of
Congress, and I think when you have an extreme remedy
of that nature, that it certainly raises a question as to
whether Congress intended that that type of remedy would be
available against the State.
Q

Enlighten me on this.

What does that have to do

with whether the suit is brought in the State court or the
Federal Court?
MR. BLACKMAR:

Well, the Pardon case

—, it’s

whether Congress intended that a State waive its immunity.
Q

Well, but you have indicated,or at least I thought

you had, that you would not have this defense that you are
• *r

arguing to a suit in the State court,
MR. BLACKMAR:
Q

Yes, sir.

Could they recover double damages and all those

statutory remedies in the State court?
ME. BLACKMAR:

They would certainly be in a

position to argue that they could.
Q

Is there anything in the Act which indicates that

you wouldn’t get the same remedy in the State court as in
the Federal court?
MR. BLACKMAR:

No, there isn’t.

Q

So you are really just arguing the forum, aren’t

you?
MR. BLACKMAR:

I am arguing the forum:, and I think,

in view of the remedy, it certainly raises the question as to
whether Congress intended that the forum be available.
Q

As I understood you, Mr. Blackmar, you haven't

conceded, however, that this kind of suit could be brought in
a State court,you simply pointed out that question is not
before us.
MR, BLACKMAR:

Yes, X have tried to limit .it to

that question.
The final factor that the 8th Circuit relied on,
and I think it is significant, is the fact that there are
alternative remedies which will vindicate the Congressional
purpose behind the Fair Labor standards Act amendments.
How, in the Pardon case, if the court had not found
that the Federal forum was available to the employee, suing
the State of Alabama, he would have been left without a
remedy.
Hie whole purpose of the Federal Employees
Liability Act was to permit injured employees to recover.
How, X think, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and
it has been discussed by the others, permits suits in
State courts as well as Federal courtf
either court.

It expressly says

43
This Act, Your Honors, only says a court of
competent jurisdiction.
Q

That certainly doesn't give any intiiaations of

excluding State courts, State courts being courts of general
jurisdiction.
I thought earlier in your argument you had virtually
;

'

-A".**'-

V

conceded that, not in this last colloquy but
MR. BLAGKMAR:

Well, X do not believe the question

is before the Court.
Q

X know.
MR. BLACKMAR:

But I would say that it is a

difficult question and that Missouri, based on several cases,
would be hard pressed to argue that the State court did not
have jurisdiction to hear the action.
Q

Mr. Blackmar, I am thinking that there might be

two separate inquiries as to whether a suit like this might
be entertained in the State courts of Missouri, the first
being whether under Missouri State law you could sue this
particular public institution, the second being whether
Congress might have by implication required the State courts
to entertain such action.
MR. BLACKMAR:

That would be right.

X would

probably reverse the order as to — the order in which you
asked the questions — but there would be two separate
inquiries.

Q

Let me ask you, is there a forum in Missouri for

employees of the State to sue for back wages ?

Has Missouri

waived its own sovereign immunity in its own courts?
MR, BLACKMAR:

Missouri has been very, very

reluctant to yield one bit of Its sovereign immunity.
Now, there is a fairly recent ease involving a.
State contract where the court -Q

Is this almost entirely a judicial construct in

Missouri or is it statutorial?
MR. BLACKMAR:

Basically judicial.

We do not have

constitutional provisions like Alabama does, and I believe
Illinois, which are very express on that question of sovereign
immunity.
Q

I suppose you can therefore make the argument that

a State court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction?
MR. BLACKMAR:
Q

Well —

In any event, it was pointed out at the outset
MR. BLACKMAR:

I would hate to lead myself into the

position of arguing against the position I may have to argue
sometime in State court,
Q

In any event, that question is not before us, and

that is your real point.
MR. BLACKMAR:

Finally, the 8th Circuit did consider

the alternative remedies that are available, which I think
really will vindicate the act and certainly have in Missouri.

After the Secretary of Labor filed his action,
the Missouri Legislature, for the first time, took cognizance
of the problem.

They appropriated a sum of money which was

sufficient to satisfy the judgment.

The people who had

compensation coming to them were paid, and the State was
able to pay them reserving its traditional practices of
paying on appropriations and warrants drawn by the State
Treasurer, after action by the State Legislature.
It mas asked as to whether the State of Missouri
would have a defense to the double damage provisions.
Section 11 of the Portal to Portal Act allows an
employer to make a defense that the act «- or admission giving
rise to such action was in good faith, that is not Che act
or admission giving rise to the failure to pay wages.
After reading the Portal to Portal cases, 1 am not
at all sure, and I am rather pessimistic, that Missouri would
have any defense that would meet the traditional PorCal to
Portal Act arguments, that Missouri has acted in good faith
and should be permitted not to have to pay the double
damages.
This is a serious question and it is a question
that goes to the heart, I think, of our Federal system.
It may not be fair from a strict equity sense that
States are immune from suit in the Federal courts for their
wrongs, but It is established law.

48
When the Court hold otherwise, back in the case of
Chisholm v. Georgia, there was an immediate response by ~~
on the part of Congress and the States with the enactment of
the Eleventh Amendment.
Ever since that date, the courts have been very
respectful of the States’ sovereign immunity.
Congress has not expressly said that the States are
to lose that immunity,

I don’t think it is fair to read that

into the act by implication.
I would like to close my argument with this
observation.

When the Portal to Portal Act was enacted, the

Congress started out with this finding;

”The Congress finds

that the first effort, of the Fair Labor Standards Act of

1938, as amended, has been interpreted judicially in dis­
regard of long-established customs and precedents.”
I would think that if the Court were to find that
Missouri has lost its Constitutional immunity, that that would
be a holding that would be contrary to long-established
customs and precedents.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr, Blackmar,

Mr. Zwerdling, you have a few minutes left.

49
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A. L. ZWERDLING, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ZWERDLING:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

My approach to the statutory intent here was
perhaps more pedestrian than that of my brother at the bar.
I went to the statute and I cited very carefully
and explicitly to this Court the language that Congress
injected in 1966 by its amendments, and I traced carefully
the result, by virtue of that set of statutory amendments.
And nothing could be more explicit than the
Congressional intent there.
I will not yield to the temptation of wandering into
the thicket of the question of whether the State courts are
in or are out,
I would merely observe that assuming, for the sake
of argument only, that the State courts are available as a
remedy, Congress chose to give the employees access to the
Federal system, to the Federal courts, with all of the
advantages that flow therefrom, including
Q

They were explicit, I think you said, in stamping

a Federal suit against a State in Federal court.
MR. ZWERDLING:

I was saying that in a definition,

in the amendment of Section 3 of the definitions, giving
access to Section 16(b) to these employees covered by the
amendments, where it says in Section 16(b), "any court of

50
competent jurisdiction.”
Q

Do you think, that is explicit enough to take care

of the -MR. ZWERDL1KG:

It is particularly explicit in the

light of the fact that the statute has been on the books
since 1938 and almost invariably these suits occur in
Federal court,
And Congress had the experience of all the years
since 1938 of the exercise of this statutory language in
thousands and tens of thousands of private employee suits
in Federal court where they almost invariably go under
Section 16(b).
And in the light of that experience, Congress,in
its amendment of the definition,chase to pass on to the
public employees covered,as it had in '38 to the private
employees, that access.
Q

Does this show any discussion or consideration of

the Eleventh Amendment problem?
MR. ZWERDLING:
Q

Not as such, Your Honor.

You wouldn’t think that that would escape their

attention.
MR. ZWERDLING:

It would escape their attention,

I believe, if it were not in question as it appeared not to
be in question since they enacted these amendments in 1966,
barely two years after this Court handed down -Pg&deiis which

51
laid down the disposition

of.

this question, and in the

light of that knowledge, Congress enacted the amendments of
1966.
There are 50 States, as counsel points out,
but there are some 118,000 establishments in question here,
which is a horse of somewhat different color in terns of
the problem of the Secretary of Labor enforcement.
And just to illustrate, in the facts of this case,
the complaint here was filed when?

The complaint was filed

by these employees in August of 1969 for back pay and
liquidated damages commencing in February of 1967.
The Secretary of Labor came in later in January of
1971, reaching back only to January of 1969, and then only
because of the course of this litigation and its .disposition.
Let me just conclude by reemphasising, once again,
that as was said in Pardon, quote, "by empowering Congress
to regulate commerce, then, the

States necessarily surrender

any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way
of such regulation,"
Such regulation involves two sides of the coin.
It involves reaching the substantive matter by exercise of
the commerce power to achieve this coverage that we are
talking about, but at the same time there goes with that
exercising commerce power to reach the remedy which is the
chosen means which has been;itfcilissGd successfully since 1938

52
which Congress, in the light of that long experience with
millions of situations around the country

with some 40

million people, decided to extend to certain limited classes
of State employees, as they did here, we believe that
Maryland v. Wirtg and Parden govern.
And, as was said in Maryland v._ Wirtg, and i conclude
on this, if I may, it said, quote, "This court was, of course,
concerned only with the finding of a substantial effect on
interstate competition and not with the consequent policy
decisions."
Quoting another case, Kataenbach, this Court said,
"Where we find that the legislatures have a rational basis
for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the
protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end."
May I submit that in Parden,when that case was
concluded, the court had already determined as to this
situation that that case -- that this investigation is at
an end.
Thank you.
Q

Would you think, as an another factor to be taken

into account, the greater uniformity that might be achieved
in dealing with these cases in eleven circuits as distinguished
from 50 State courts?
MR. ZWERDLING:
is better than mine.

Mr. Chief Justice, that argument

All the aspects of the Federal

53
jurisdiction, the availability of liberal discovery which is
very important to employees in these suits, the uniformity
that you point out, the fact that there is more expertise
in interpreting Federal laws, all of the panoply of reasons
which would cause Congress to be moved to make this remedy
available in any court of competent jurisdiction,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

BURGER:

Thank

you, Mr..

2wes;dlir.g.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:28 o’clock, p,m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
