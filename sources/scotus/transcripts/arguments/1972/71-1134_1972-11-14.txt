Mr. Wicker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP K. WICKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WICKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The single issue in this case arises out of the
conviction of the petitioner in the Circuit Court of Pulaski
County, Kentucky, following a jury trial for violating
Kentucky's obscenity statute, which is Kentucky Revised
Statutes, Chapter 436, Section 101.

Petitioner was convicted

under Subsection 2 of that statute, which may be found on
pages 3 and. 4 of the Brief for Petitioner.
The facts in this case are simple and for the most
part undisputed.

On the night of September 29, 1970, the

Sheriff of Ptilaski County, Kentucky purchased a ticket to
Highway 27 Drive-In Theatre, which was managed by the
petitioner.

The sheriff viewed the entire film

being

exhibited that evening, which was entitled "Cindy and Donna.’’
Immediately following the exhibition of the film,
the sheriff proceeded to the projection booth of the theatre
and there arrested the petitioner on a charge of violating
of violating this statute, and seized the film.

At the time

4
the arrest was made and the film was seised, there was no
warrant in the hands of the sheriff issued by any magistrate.
No magistrate had viewed the film.

There were no descriptive

affidavits furnished to any magistrate.

Admittedly,, there

was no hearing of aiy kind before a judicial officer,
adversary, or ex parte, to focus on the question of
obscenity.

The sheriff, upon viewing the film, ex parte and

on his own made a determination that the film was obscene
and such ex parte determination on his part led to the
arrest and seizure of the film.
0

If on Monday night the sheriff went with the

local magistrate, a person authorised to issue warrants, and
the magistrate observed the film and then on Tuesday morning
issued a warrant, would that satisfy your claim?
MR. WICKER:
0

No, Your Honor.

You would want an adversary proceeding in which

you could appear to try to persuade the magistrate that there
was not probable cause to believe-—
MR. WICKER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

That is correct.
Q

You are going to try out the issue of

obscenity in the warrant-issuing proceeding?
MR. WICKER:

We would ask a meaningful opportunity

on tlie part of the petitioner to be heard to counter the
judgment of the local law enforcement officer that the film

5
was obscene»
Q

Would the issue then not be probable cause

but obscenity vel non of the film?

MR. WICKER;

I think the issue would be probable

obscenity of the film.
Q

Probable cause.

Q

I donf t see why in your case-—maybe you are

concerned about impairing the success of the next case.- but
taking your case alone-—I don't see why you need to contend
that the Constitution requires an adversary hearing.

You

simply, I should suppose, need to contend that the Constitu­
tion requires that there can be no seizure except by warrant
issued by a magistrate, a neutral and detached magistrate,
on the basis of probable cause.

And yet all through your

brief you talk about an adversary hearing being required.
MR. WICKER;

Your Honor, we believe the issue of

obscenity is so sensitive, and this Court has said that it
is separated by only a dim and uncertain line, and that
separation calls for the use of sensitive tools.

We believe

that it is required here.
Q

Do you think it is more sensitive than

searching a private home?
MR. WICKER:
Q

Yes.

Under Kentucky law, do you have an adversary

proceeding to get a search warrant to search a private horae?

6
MR. WICKER:
Q

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Wicker, I thought-—perhaps I am wroncr—in

Marcus and A Quantity of Rooks, both of which involved
magazines, as I remember, X thought we held the proceeding,
even though it is a warrant proceeding, had to be one in
which there was determination not of probable cause but of
the obscenity vel non of the material before they could be
seized.

Am I wrong about that?
MR. WICKER:

Mr, Justice Brennan, my reading of the

Marcus and Books case convinces me that adversary hearing
pertains to probable obscenity.

$

You wrote the opinion.

0

That does not prove too much.

Q

Then what would there be to try if the

determination was a determination vel non of the obscenity?
What do you need a further proceeding for?

Is that by way

of appellate review or trial de novo?
MR. WICKER:

There would be no need for any further

proceeding if it were determined that there was not probable
cause to believe the film to be obscene.
Q

I am taking the other tack.

If the magistrate

issues the warrant on a showing which must reach the level of
a determination of obscenity rather than probable cause or
probable obscenity-MR. WICKER:

There would be no need for further

trial in that case, Your Honor.

7
Q

Then you might be into trial the next morning

after a showing of the film, might you not?

Would that he

res adjudicata of the issue?
MR. WICKER:

No, Your Honor.

On the day following the arrest of the petitioner
and the seizure of the film, the sheriff took it to the
grand jury of Pulaski County and an indictment was returned,
charging th© petitioner with the offense of which he was
convicted.

The petitioner three days later pleaded not

guilty and the case was set for trial on the 20th of
October.

On the 12th of October the petitioner moved to

suppress this film as evidence and to dismiss the indictment,
contending as he doss here today that the film was illegally
seized in violation of due process of law, because there
had been no adversary hearing prior to the seizure.

The

motion to suppress and dismiss the indictment was overruled
and petitioner's trial began.

And petitioner at the trial

again objected to admission of the film in evidence and
renewed his motion to suppress.

The trial court overruled.

The issue was again raised before the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky, and that court affirmed the conviction on June 25,
1971, and denied rehearing.
At no point prior to the seizure, did the petitioner
or anyone in his behalf have an opportunity to contest the
judgment of the sheriff that this film was.obscene.

So,

8

thus is presented the

single issue of whether in the absence

of a prior adversary hearing the seizure incident to arrest
of allegedly obscene material is a violation of due process
of law.
Q

Mr. Wicker, as I read the opinion of the

Kentucky Court of Appeals, the commissioner who wrote the
opinion said that during the trial of the action you conceded
the obscenity of the film? is that a correct statement?
MR» WICKER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we maintain

that that is not a correct statement of the closing argument,
( *

and we think that a fair reading of the closing argument will
disclose to this Court that that was trial strategy.

And

even if the Court concluded that there was a concession made
in the closing argument, we nevertheless maintain that all
material, regardless of its eventual characterization as
obscene or non-obscene, is clothed with the same procedural
safeguard until there has been an adversary hearing.
Q

Would not an adversary hearing have been pretty

much of a charade in this case if when you first got your
chance to have an adversary hearing in the trial you conceded
the obscenity of the thing?
MR. WICKER:

We did not concede the obscenity, but

for the protection of material that is non-obscene, whether
this material turned out to be obscene or not or whether it
was conceded

at any time during the trial, we clo not think

it is important»

We think it was clothed with the same

procedural safeguards as non-obsesne material until the
determination in an adversary hearing.
Petitioner in his contention here relies on the
opinion of this Court in Marcus v. Search Warrants of
Property, A Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas,and Lee
Art Theatre v„ Virginia.

And the gist again of petitioner’s

contention is that discretion to 3ee allegedly obscene material
cannot be confided to lav/ enforcement officers without some
safeguards for the protection of non-obscene material.

And

a seizure without a warrant, such as occurred in this case,
there were no safeguards at all to prevent the suppression of
non-obscene films which are protected by the Constitution,
And because First Amendment rights are involved here, the
sheriff of Pulaski County, Kentucky had no discretion to
say that a crime had been committed in his presence.

A state

is not free, this Court said in Marcus, to adopt whatever
procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity without
regard to the possible consequences of constitutionally
protected speech, and the line between speech unconditionally
guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be punished
is finely drawn.

It is dim and uncertain, and separation of

the legitimate from the illegitimate calls for the use of
sensitive tools.
So, her© we have an esc parts non-judicial

determination of probable obscenity by a law enforcement
officer in the field»

The sheriff acted as judge in a sense

and nowhere was there any procedure designed to focus
searchingly on the question of obscenity.
shown for two nights prior to the seizure.

This film had
There was no

emergency or danger to the community which compelled the
seizure without at least a warrant or some prior judicial
scrutiny.

The test of obscenity as laid down by this Court

in the Roth case is so difficult to apply that it must be made
judicially.
To permit unbridled discretion in law enforcement
officers to apply such tests amounts to a vague and
standardless delegation of judicial power.

We believe that

Marcus and Books require the courts of law to make the
determination that there is probable cause to believe the
film obscene» and this only after a meaningful opportunity to
be heard in an adversary proceeding.

Police officers in the

field are not equipped to apply the test and separate the
legitimate from the illegitimate.

While police officers may

be properly trained experts in the detection and proper
identification of the usual paraphernalia of crime, they do
not enjoy such a status with respect to the determination
of literature and movies.
Q

When

a policeman on the beat witnesses

conduct which he regards as obscene and defends particular

11

ordinances or statutes, does he not have to make a judgment
then and there whether there is probable Cause to make an
arrest and take the person into custody?
MR. WICKER;

That is true in most, cases. Hr. Chief

Justice, but not in the area of First Amendment rights.
Q

Suppose the man says that h© is picketing

for something or other but is engaging in a lewd and obscene
exhibition in that process, carrying a picket sign at the
same time.

Does not the policeman have to make judgments

constantly?
MR. WICKER:

I do not believe that, a police officer

in the field is capable of applying the Roth test with
respect to obscenity.
Q

A policeman in these circumstances is not

making any final determination, is he?
MR. WICKER;

But once he makes this determination

and seises the film, then there is the danger that non™
obscene material has been restrained.
Q

Mr. Wicker, would it make any difference in

your position if your client had had a cuplicate film and
could have continued to show it to the public?
MR. WICKER:

Mr. Justice Powell, 1 believe that any

requirement that a theatre owner keep two films on hand is
burdensome and—
0

That was not my question.

Assume he did have

12
a duplicate film so that there was no prior restraint and
he could have continued to show it.

Would your position Joe

different?
MR. WICKER;

I still feel that the petitioner’s

Fourth amendment rights were involved and that even the
seizure.of one film imposes a restraint, whether it is one
film or a dozen films.
Q

That particular film was restrained.

If your client had operated a bookstore with

a hundred books, and only one was seised for the purpose of
evidence at a trial, I take it your answer would foe the same.
MR. WICKER:

My answer would be the same,

Mr. Justice Powell, because we believe the First Amendment
makes no reference to quantity, that it affords one book, one
film, the same protection.

Q

Mr. Wicker, returning for a moment to the

question I asked you earlier, I call your attention to page 37
of the Appendix in what was apparently your argument to the
jury at the bottom of the page 37.

You say, "if the film which

you saw yesterday' ’’was all that was on trial hare, X would
not be here.

I would not be good enough to tell you at the

outset that in behalf of Mr. Rsaden I am not going to get up
here and defend the film observed yesterday nor the revolting
scenes in it or try to argue or persuade you that those scenes ware not obscene."
I take it that is what the commissioner referred to.

13

MR. WICKER;
Q

Yes, it was.

X would certainly be inclined to think that

supported his suggestion that you had conceded it.
MR. WICKER;

We maintain, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

that we did not concede the obscenity of the film? that this
was trial strategy.

The jury which saw the film and came

back to the courtroom was ready to—if Kentucky law had
permitted it—would have hanged this man.
given him the death penalty.

They would have

We felt like there was no

chance of persuading this jury that the film was not obscene.
Q

How is your situation different in this

case with that argument than if you had been

defending a

man on a first degree murder charge and you argued to the
jury that yes, undoubtedly he did kill the victim but it was
an accident and therefore it should be a manslaughter
verdict and not a first degree murder verdict?
different?

Is this any

If so, how is it different?
MR. WICKER:

Your Honor, I do not believe there is

much difference in that.

The jury had to make two findings.

First, is the film obscene?

And, second, was the defendant

guilty of showing an obscene film?

And we concentrated on

the second thing, the conduct of the defendant.

We felt we

did not have much chance in convincing that jury that this
film was not obscene.
Q

Does it make any difference to your argument

14
whether it was obscene or not?
MR. WICKER:
Q

No, it does not/ Mr» Justice Marshall»

Just for my information, was it obscene or not?

MR. WICKER:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not believe

that that film was obscene when compared with other films
which have been held not to be obscena.
Mr. Chief Justice, I request to reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well, Mr. Wicker.

Mr. Bullock.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT V. BULLOCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BULLOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the

Court, may it please the Court:
The question an has been stated before the Court,
in the absence of a prior adversary hearing, Is a seizure
incident to arrest of allegedly obscene material a violation
of clue process?

Our answer, of course, is no.

Let me go into, if I may, a few of the facts that
may not have been fully brought out before.

On September 28,

1970, the Deputy Sheriff of Pulaski County observed
approximately 30 minutes of the film "Cindy and Donna" from
a vantage point outside of the theatre at a road nearby.
Thereafter, he reported to his superior, the Sheriff of
Pulaski County.

The next evening, as was noted,on September

15
29r 1970 , the sheriff accompanied in this case by the
Commonwealth Attorney, who is the chief prosecuting officer
for that district, paid admission for entrance into the
theatre for showing of the film.

After a viewing of the

entire film—the entire film—the sheriff proceeded to the
projection booth and arrested the petitioner, Mr. Roadan, who
was at that time changing the cartoon, 'X believe it was, on
the projection theatre.

It was upside down.

The sheriff

seised the film incident to the lawful arrest.
The following day, on September 30th, the matter was
presented to the grand jury, who returned the indictment, a
trial on the merits of the case was had, and a verdict was
entered October 21, 1970.

There are certain facts in this

case that are somewhat peculiar.

We take issue with my

Brother Wicker concerning whether the film’s obscenity has
been acknowledged.

The • petioner obviously acknowledged the

obscenity of th® film, as was earlier noted.

And during the

course of appeal through the courts he has not seriously
contended otherwise.
To answer your question, Mr. Justice Marshall, in
our opinion, the film was obscene in this case.
The petitioner in this case also moved—
Q

While you are talking about the film, when

was this film returned to him, if ever?
MR. BULLOCK:

When is it or has it been?

16

Q

Yes.

MR. BULLOCK:

It is in the custody of the Court of

Appeals, sir.
Q

Until this day?

MR. BULLOCK:

Until this day, yes, sir.

Of

Kentucky.
Q

You do not have any First Amendment problems

with that, do you?
MR. BULLOCK:

No, sir, because even to this day—and

this was my next point-—petitioner has not moved for the
return of the film.

He has moved for the film which was

admittedly obscene to be suppressed in evidence, but he has
not moved for a return of this film so he might later show it,
copies of "Cindy and Donna.”
Q

He did not gives it to you.

MR. BULLOCK:
Q

That is correct.

You took it.
For use as evidence.

Did you also give it bade to him?

MR. BULLOCK:

I would say that the burden would be

on petitioner to move for its return.
Q

Now will you answer my question? have you

offered to give it back?
MR. BULLOCK:

No, sir.

Extreme caution, we maintain, was used to safeguard
against the abridgement of petitioner's constitutional right.
The chief prosecutor for the district accompanied the sheriff

17
in this case at the time of arrest and. seizure and
presumably he would have had the opportunity to advise the
sheriff on the probable cause.

As I have noted, the grand

jury the next day affirmed and confirmed the fact that there
was probable cause f and they returned an indictment.

In this

case I mean to emphasize the fact that the trial of the
case was completed some 22 days after the original arrest and
seizure.

There was a determination within that period of

time.
We maintain that the seizure of the film was
incidental to

a lawful arrest for a crime which was committed

in the officer's presence and that the reason for the
seizure of this film was for its use as best evidence of the
commission of the crime and not for the purposes of suppressing
ideas or First Amendment rights.
As noted by our Kentucky Court of Appeals, this is
the way we are differentiating, we have differentiated, the
Marcus and Quantity cases which we: -interpret to be for the
purpose of suppressing and destroying evidence.

I might also,

add that the Kentucky statutes specifically permit a peace
officer to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor that is
committed in his presence.
And also in answer to an earlier question, 1 would
say that in many instances a police officer must make a quick
judgment concerning an obscene situation.

And the peace

18

officers in most instances, in all instances, are lawabiding officers; they are sworn to a particular duty.

The

material here, which was a film, differs from books and
pamphlets—
Q

Mr. Bullock, in the Marcus case the police

officer there involved went to the various newsstands and
picked up a copy of each of the magazines involved, did
he not?
MR. BOLLOCK:
Q

Yes,' sir.

And then he went before a magistrate on sworn

complaints in which he stated that each of the newsdealers,
and I am quoting, kept for the purpose of sale obscene
publications, did he not?

And then on the basis of that,

the circuit judge issued the six warrants which were then
executed.
MR. BULLOCK:
Q

Yes, sir.

And we held that that procedure did not

comport with constitutional due process in light of the First
Amendment implications involved, did we not?
MR. BULLOCK;
Q
was done there?

Yes, sir.

Row is the procedure here differ any from what
You say this was incident to a lawful

arrest.
MR. BULLOCK:
Q

Yes, sir.

This was a seizure, similarly nobody was

19

arrested at that time.

Because that was, as you pointed out,

a suppression here.
MR. BULLOCK:
Q

Right.

But other than that, how was there any

difference between the two procedures?

Why does the

seizure of the operator make that any different from due
process and First Amendment context?
MR. BULLOCK:
to that, sir.

I think there might be two answers

First, the case we're involved in here was a

crime that was committed in the officer’s presence.

And,

second, we are dealing with a film as opposed to a book.
is a big difference in a film.
They can be changed.

There

Films can be altered quickly.

Certain objectionable portions can be

quickly taken out of the film.
Q

Our point is not whether a state may have a

procedure to seize a film to prevent its being altered.

Our

question is, is it not, whether the state may have a procedure
for seizure of the film itself without first determining its
obscenity; that is the question, sir.
MR. BULLOCK:
your question, sir.
Q

Yes.

J am not sure 1 understand

'

what we are concerned with here is whether you

can issue a warrant, as was done in this case, was it not,
on probable cause.
MR. BULLOCK;

There was no warrant, no, sir.

20
Q

Ho warrant.

MR. BULLOCK:

Just an arrest?

There was an arrest in the officer's

presence.
Q

And the question is whether you can do that

without having a determination of the obscenity vel non of
the motion picture.
MR„ BULLOCK:

And we maintain that you do not have

to have the prior adversary hearing or determination vel non
ahead of time.
cause.

What you need is determination of probable

In this case,, the sheriff made that determination.
Q

And this is on the ground that there is a

difference between films and magazines.
MR. BULLOCK;
Q

That is part of it, yes, sir.

I gather that there have been a good many

cases that have held the other way; most of them, I gather.
MR. BULLOCK:

There have been a number of eases

in the lower courts, especially in district courts, that
have held you could have seizure and then they have been
sometimes overturned.

A number of state courts the same way.

They have been overturned.

But there are still some cases

left.
Q

Marcus and A Quantity of Books did not hold

that you could not seize one copy for the use as evidence, did
they?
MR. BULLOCK:

Not to my recollection, no, sir.

21

Q

They just held that you could not take out of

circulation that entire series of publications,.
MR. BULLOCK;
Q

That is correct, yes..

Of course, taking one copy out of circulation

of a movie might take the entire showing out of circulation.
MR. BULLOCK;

As we maintain, Mr. Justice White,

in our brief, we feel that it is not unreasonable to require
in certain circumstances a second copy to be kept, if there is
a probability or a possibility that this is an obscene movie.
Q

If you were going to have a hearing about

obscenity, you could have given them a subpoena to bring it
to that particular hearing .and otherwise leave it in circula­
tion.

If all you are really trying to do is to have the

evidence available at the hearing, unless you think there is
really some substance in the alteration theory.
MR. BULLOCK:

I believe there is substance in the

alteration theory, yes, sir.

I also believe that there is

some substance in the difficulty in which we face where an
operator may remove that film and send it to another state
very quickly, because most of these films are on a schedule
of—
Q

If the operator had two films, you would not

argue that the state could seise both copies in the face of
Marcus and Quantity, would you?

What would foe wrong with having the magistrate

and the sheriff and the prosecutor go and see the movie on
Monday, issue the warrant

Tuesday, and go out and seize

it then, if a non-adversary proceeding would satisfy
Kentucky law and the Constitution?

Thera are a number of

"ifs" in there.
MR. RULLOCK:

Ves.

The Kentucky law, though, says

that it is proper to seise the evidence incident to a lawful
arrest, and there was a proper arrest.

And it is my

understanding the question before the Court is whether there
is a need for a prior adversary hearing.

And it is, of course

our contention that it is not necessary.

Even if there is not a need for a prior

adversary hearing, you would lose if the

Constitution

Q

We could possibly do that too.

No, I thought you meant ask for a

I misunderstood you.
Is there anything in the record to show any

expertise on the part of either of these two men in the field
of what is and what is not obscenity?
MR. BULLOCK:

The record, Mr. Justice Marshall,

shows that the sheriff had been a sheriff for some ten years.
It shows that he was familiar with the statute.
he quoted it during the trial on the issue.

The fact is

He knew what the

statute was, and I think a man of common intelligence can
determine what is prurient if this material taken as a whole

value.

This is not a determination, a final determination,

on the matter.

It is a determination of probable--

not the film is going to be seized.

That's correct»

That’s correct.

So, that is final.

MR. BULLOCKs

Yes, sir, but of course if it is not

obscene-—
Q

And there is absolutely no expertise over and

above any other citizen in this county in the field of
obscenity.
MR. BULLOCK:

Of course, if it is not obscene, it

would be returned.
Q

My question is, Does he have any expertise in

the field of obscenity over and beyond every other citizen
in the county?
MR. BULLOCK:

There is no showing in the record

that he has any expertise other than being a law enforcement
officer.

Then how did he know that a crime was being

committed?
MR. BULLOCK;

Because he could observe the

situation that is occurring and come to tha conclusion that
it did appeal to prurient interests.

that anybody in the theatre could mate a citizen’s arrest»
MR. BULLOCK:
0

You do not think so.

MR. BULLOCK:
Q

Not for a misdemeanor, no, sir.

Wo, sir.

Mr. Bullock, do you suppose these jurors had

any particular expertise when they returned a verdict of
guilty?
MR. BULLOCK:

I was going to mention that, sir.

It would appear to me that if a jury can make a determination
that a particular film is obscene, this would likewise be
true for a peace officer, at least as far as probable cause
is concerned.
Q

Would it not follow as a matter of course

that if lay jurors can do it, a peace officer can do it on
the lesser standard of probable cause, whereas the lay juror
has got to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR, BULLOCK:
Q

Yes, sir, that would be my point.

Was this a drive-in?

MR. BULLOCK:

Yes, sir, it was a drive-in which,

without getting into the Rabe or Robey case, at least the ,
deputy sheriff was to the side of the movie theatre and was
observing it from a post outside of the—Q

Meaning where, a bridge or something?

MR. BULLOCK:

No, it was a little street or road

to the side of the drive-in theatre.

27

Q

And he could see it from the street?

MR. BULLOCK:

He could sea the nude scenes that

were going on from that area, yes, sir,
I might also point out the difference between the
films and the books, is that you can purchase books for use
in evidence; whereas, in the case of a film being shown in
a drive-in theatre, you can’t very easily purchase that for
use in evidence.

And, as we say, the film is the best

evidence and it would provide a fair basis for a decision of
the Court, not only for the prosecution but also for the
defense.

Because obviousy if we are talking about certain

isolated segments, this is not enough to satisfy the
definition involved in Roth.
So, the film itself, taken as a whole, must be
obtained in order to make a decision in this case,
I would also point out that the ideas that are
conveyed in "Cindy and Donna" are probably not of such a
nature that it would be a tremendous abridgement of

It had been

So, we are saying that absent a pattern of
harassment or in an attempt to suppress ideas, the seizure
of obscene material incident to a lawful arrest is beneficial
to justice, both for the prosecution and the defense»
Since this Court has stated in 'Roth and later in
Reldel that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment
there is no basis for placing hurdles in front of lawenforcement officers in the prosecution of their duties.
This film as we say, was admittedly obscene.

It is an obscene film.

It is not
Requiring an

adversary hearing, as suggested by petitioner, would put
law-enforcement officials in an untenable position of trying
to enforce laws which this Court and the Commonwealth of
Kentucky say are lawful, while putting obstacles for the best
means of doing so in the way of the law-enforcement officers.
In this respect I think it is important that we enforce white
collar crime—laws against white-collar crime just as much
as we do crimes of violence.
Obviously, if you can get by with white-collar
crimes such as obscenity or consumer protection or

environmental laws, this breaks down a respect for the
judiciary and the law-enforcement officials, if they can see
this going on here.

And yet a man who does a crime of

violence is immediately placed in custody and tried.
As we noted earlier, the petitioner did not move
for return of his material.

We feel that it can be assumed

that his purpose for his motion, which he made before the
Court, was for the purpose of suppression of an obscene
to avoid prosecution.

There was a speedy review of the

action taken by taking the matter before the Grand Jury of
Pulaski County the ne^t day.
Your Honors, if it please the Court, I would like
to state that in an attempt not to overstate my case in my
brief I may have understated my case on a particular point.
On page 11, 1 stated;

"Although a failure to indict by a

grand jury would not have assured petitioner of his release
or the release of his film, the fact that it went before the
grand jury was a showing of good faith."
I would like to correct any ambiguity there by
saying that pursuant to the Kentucky Rules of Criminal
Procedure, 5.22, if a defendant is not indicted by a grand
jury, he must be released.

Second, 1S5.

However, a subsequent grand
This is Marcus v. Bradley,
A failure of a grand jury in

this case to indict would have resulted in the release of

30

petitioner,, the immediate release, and he would have remained
free absent a subsequent grand jury indictment, and
presumably his film would have bean released with him.

I

might add that if this film was not released, he could have
made a motion to the court for its release and if the lower
court refused to do it, a writ of mandamus would be a proper
remedy before our Court of Appeals,

This was indicated in

the case of Johnson v. Commonwealth, 475 Southwest

Second,

893, which was decided subsequent to the case before this
Court,
There was a speedy trial in this case, the 22 days.
This was done in order to jealously guard petitioner's rights.
This Court recently in U. S. v„ Thirty-Seven Photographs
held that where there was seizure of allegedly obscene
material by custom officials, there would not be an undue
hardship if the forfeiture proceedings were commenced within
14 days and completed within 60 days of their commencement»
This would allow a total of 74 days from seizure to decision.
In our present case before our Kentucky Court of Appeals,
there was seizure on September 29, 1970, an indictment the
following day, and the trial was concluded on October 21,
1970.

This was some 22 days after the arrest and seizure,

and I submit to the Court that this is significantly less
than the 74 days that was indicated in the Thirty-Seven
r

Photographs case.

Q

Is there any evidence in this record as to

what it cost to rent this film and how long it Would have
taken him to gat a substitute film?
MR. BULLOCK:
recordo

No, sir, there is no showing in the

I would assume it could be done fairly easily and

without a whole lot of cost.
Pulaski County, Kentucky is not like New York
City or some of the big cities»

Pulaski County, Kentucky

is essentially a rural area? requiring an adversary hearing
would, in my estimation, penalize rural areas»

For instance,

in Pulaski County there is one circuit judge who covers two
counties.

There are other lesser judges, but our main judge

is a circuit judge and he covers two counties.
Q

Who issues warrants?

MR. BULLOCK:
Q

Do you have them?

MR. BULLOCK:
0
magistrates?

Magistrates, X believe, can issue—

We have a county judge too.

Yes, but I mean, do you have available
So, if a warrant had been required here, I

gather there would have been an available magistrate.
MR. BOLLOCK:

On a warrant situation, 1 would suppos

this is probably true.
There are not, however, judges that are quickly
available to be able to go and have a prior adversary
hearing before this film, which we submit is fugitive in

32
nature.

It can be shipped to another state and lost, the

evidence lost of the eoaimission of the crime.
In conclusion, Your Honor, we submit that the
Commonwealth has used careful procedures to protect
petitioner’s constitutional rights.

We are basically talking

about a Fourth Amendment case and not necessarily a First
Amendment case.

The prior adversary hearing situation, which

has been interpreted by many of the courts, is simply not
a workable solution.

It will not work.

What is needed

is

a firm determination by this Court that a peace officer can
make arrest and seizure of the film when that arrest and
seisure is for the purposes of tssing in evidence the material.
For these reasons, if it please the Court, we respectfully
request that this Court affirm the holding of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Bullock.

Mr. Wicker, do you have anything further?
MR. WICKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP K. WICKER;.ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WICKER:

As to the expertise of the Sheriff of

Pulaski County, in this case if a comparison is made of the
sheriff's reading of the Roth definition of obscenity, which
he copied from the Kentucky statute as shown on page 17 of the
Appendix, a comparison of that with v?hat the statute actually

33

says as shown on page 3 of the petitioner's brief,
formidably illustrates that the sheriff could not even read
the definition of obscenity much less purport to comprehend i
For instance, he copied, "To the average person
applying to a temporary standard," when the statute caysf
Applying contemporary community standards."
I wish to make the point that the petitioner also
contends that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated
in this case.

The prosecution would distinguish the Books

and Mar cits cases by saying that in those cases large
quantities of books were seised, while in this case only one
copy of a film was seised.

We say that this distinction is

not legally significant because the single film is equal
in disseminative power to a large quantity of books; it is
equal to the entire stock of a newsdealer or to the entire
inventory of a newsdealer.
Q

That is the state’s position here, that one

exhibition reaches many, many people.

Are you supporting the

state’s position on that score?
MR. WICKER;

The restraint imposed upon this ■,

exhibition deprives many people of an opportunity to see the
film, to receive the expression and the ideas contained
therein.
Q

But if it is obscenity, do you concede that

they are not entitled to exhibit it and people are not

34
entitled to receive it?
MR. WICKER:

If it is obscenity„

Again, Your Honor, the determination

is so sensitive under the Roth test that there is no other
way to determine obscenity»

I say that it cannot be delegated

to local police officers in the field»

And it is not any

answer to say that just one copy of the film was seized»

The

effect of the seizure, of one seizure and one prosecution,
can proceed ripple-like outward from its source, and we say
that the First Amendment affords national protection, that
its scope extends beyond Somerset, Kentucky»
Another point made by the prosecution is that they
apprehend that if an adversary hearing is afforded, that the
film might be kept out of the jurisdiction, edited or
altered before the adversary hearing could foe concluded.
they say that the adversary hearing just will not work.

And
We

might point out that these fears can foe met by protective
orders of the magistrate, subject to the sanction of
contempt.

To give an example, in Texas the legislature has

expressly authorised protective orders to prevent a film's
removal from the jurisdiction or alteration.

And a knowing

violation of these orders is made a separate defense.

And

courts have consistently indicated that conduct designed to
subvert or bypass the administration of justice will not foe
permitted merely because obscenity litigation may involve
the sensitive procedural tools of the First Amendment»

35
The Report of the President’s Commission on
Obscenity and Pornography points out that legislation can be
drafted to require an exhibitor or distributer to.make a
film available for judicial hearing while permitting its
exhibition pending that hearing*

And the adoption of such

legislation, consistent with local practice, would appear
warranted in jurisdictions which may continue to seek to
prosecute film exhibitors for adults, contrary to the
commission's recommendation»

The commission proposed a model

declaratory judgment and injunction statute and it provides
that whenever material is being disseminated in violation of
the obscenity laws, the state may bring a civil action against
the disseminators in order to obtain a declaration that
the dissemination is prohibited.
We say that the requirement of an adversary hearing
will work.
Application, to be made for preliminary injunction
after notice to the adverse party and opportunity for him to
be heard.

The court could grant an ex parte restraining

order to control any real threat of editing.

The order can

direct the exhibitor to keep and maintain the film within the
jurisdiction and keep it intact, and it can order and
enjoin the exhibitor from altering any part of it, and it
can punish violations of those orders by contempt.
There is nothing, we say, to prevent diligent state

36
prosecutors from executing adversary proceedings before a
judicial oi-tzcer

through notice to the distributor and a

subpoena duces tecum directed to it. with the name of each
questionable and challenged publication? and following
judicial determination of obscenity, the state authorities
raay seise and prosecute if the publications and materials are
put on sale.

And this is very clear where state procedures

are modernized,
The prosecution contends that it is significant
that petitioner did not move for a return of the film so that

It is not up to the defendant to seek return of
If the trial court hare had sustained his motion

to suppress, return of the film necessarily would follow*
The burden is on the prosecution to show their right to this
film and their right to keep it*

And return of the film in

any event is not an adequate remedy because it does not
redress the restraint which has already occurred up until the
time the film was ordered returned.
The Quantity .of Books case, I believe, makes it
clear that the adversary hearing must precede seizure in
order to protect the right to circulate non-obscene material.

37
Again, the prosecution's argument has not taken into
account the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights to ha free
from unreasonable searches and seizures, for which the onlv
adequate redress is exclusion of the evidence.

Exclusion

of the evidence will compel respect for the constitutional
guarantee, and the only effective way, as said by this Court
in Mapp V» Ohio, is by removing the incentive to di
it.

And even if the film is returned, officers are still

going to keep on seizing films, knowing that :Lt return ia
ordered with the provision that a copy be made available,
ultimately they still get the evidence.

The return of the­

ft lm proposal secures to the state the fruits of the
poisonous tree.

process of which led to obtaining the evidence.
My time is up, Your Honor.
