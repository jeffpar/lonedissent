MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 71-1304, Bradley against the
United States.
Mr. Homans, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. HOMANS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HOMANSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This is a petitioner for writ of certiorari to a
final order of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,
which order appears on page 20 of the record appendix herein,
in response to a motion for an order vacating sentences and
for remand and for motions for stay of mandate, which appear
respectively on pages 16, 17, and 18 of the record appendix.
The motions filed by the petitioners in this case
filed in order by the Court of Appeals affirming a judgment or
judgments of conviction against the four petitioners on the
merits following a prosecution for violation of 26 U„ S. Code,
Section 4705(a), now repealed, and 26 U. S. Code 7237(b).
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
MR. HOMANSt

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi
a little bit.

Mr. Homans.

Maybe you could help me

Is there anything in this record that

affirmatively indicates that the district judge did not

4
consider probation?
MR. HOMANS:

Can yon help me on that?
Yes, Your Honor.

The only thing that

would appear in this record, may it please the Court, is in
the petitioner for certiorari»

1 believe it appears on

page-—in any event, as I come to it. Your Honor—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The judgment and

commitment does not indicate—
MR. HOMANS %

No, Your Honor, not one way or the

other.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ordinarily a district

judge would, not give any indication one way or the other,
would he?
MR. HOMANS:

No, Your Honor.

In the form of

judgment which is prescribed, there is no indication one way
or another.

And off the record, Your Honor—-and I cannot

go off the record-—we did file motions after the affirmance
on the merits as distinguished from the so-called appendage
to the appeal which is in issue here? we did file motions in
the district court on which the district court took no
action.

And I believe reference to those appears in the

docket on page 2,
February 8th motions were ordered vacating
sentences arid for remand of appellants filed--motion for a
mandate filed in Court of Appeals.

That is the only indica­

tion that such a motion was filed in the district court prior

5
to it being filed in the Court of Appeals«,
In any event, Mr» Chief Justice and Members of the
Court, this was a prosecution under the prior drug law which
was repealed by Public haw 91-513, effective May 1, 1971,
The indictment which appears on pages 2 through 5
inclusive of -the appendix, charged a conspiracy in several
of the counts between March 4, 1971 and March 12, 1971, as
well as charging under 4705 of former Title 26, all of the
defendants with the substantive offense of giving away,
selling, or distribution of cocaine»
The indictment, xaay it please the Court, also
charged in counts which are not material here three of the
four petitioners with carrying a firearm during the
commission of a felony»
The important aspect of this case, so far as the
indictment is concerned, is that the indictment alleged that
the offense took place between March 4 and March 10, 1971,
which was before May 1, 1971, the effective date of repeal
as a result of 91-513, Public Law 91-513, of the prior drug
law, which contained among other statutes 26 U» S. Code,
Section 7237(d), which appears again on page

3 of the

petitioner’s brief and provides, as Your Honors are aware,
that upon conviction of offenses, the penalty—and I
emphasise penalty—'for which is provided in subsection (b)
of the

section, that the imposition or execution of sentence

6
shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted, and
in the case of a violation of a law relating to narcotic
drugs, Section 4202 of Title 18, the statute otherwise
providing for parole, shall not apply»
I would emphasise in connection with later portions
of the argument the language in (d) of 7237, which says;
"Upon conviction of any offense, the penalty for which is
provided in subsection >'b)" Referring back to subsection (b)
of 7237, that provides, "Whoever conspires to commit an
offense described in 4705(a) shall be imprisoned not less
than five or more than 20 years and, in addition, may be
fined not more than $20,000."
Thus, may it please the Court, in accordance at
least with the language of 7237(d), the penalty appears in
section (b).
Again—and I em hesitant to read statutes except
that the wording of the various statutes involved here is
important to the decision in this case.

There are two saving

statutes involved, may it please the Court, in this case»
The first statute is the general saving statute,

United

States Code Section 109, which I will read with some
emphasis»
"The repeal of any statute shall not have the
effect to release or extinguish any penalty"--and 1 emphasise
the word ’‘penalty" — "forfeiture, or liability incurred under

such statuto”-“and I emphasise the words "incurred under
such statute—"unless the repealing act shall so expressly
provide and such statute shall be treated as still remaining
in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action ox”
prosecution"—which I emphasise—"for the enforcement of
such penalty’s, forfeiture, or liability."
That is the general saving statute which has been
in the statute books since late in the 19th century unchanged.
The specific statute which appeared in Public
Laif 91-513 provides—and again I use some emphasis—"Prosecu­
tions"—! emphasise the word "prosecutions"—"for any viola­
tion of law"—-and I am reading from page 4 of our brief—
"occurring prior to the effective date of Section 1101 shall
not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by such
section..., or abated by reason thereof."
May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice, we
suggest here that Section 1103(a), the specific saving
statute, which I have just concluded reading, controls this
case.

And under the doctrines of conflict set forth in

Herts: against Woodman and in Great Northern Railway against
United States, both of which are cited in both briefs and in
our brief

on pages 9 through 13 of the petitioner's brief,

we suggest that the conflict in wording between Section 1103(a)
the specific statute, and Section 109, the general statute,
is sufficient so that 11.03(a)

is the only saving statute

8
which is involved in this case.

Later on, if time permits,

we shall argue that even if the Court disagrees and 109
appliesi the same result should still follow.
But for fee moment 1 address myself, Mr. Chief
Justice and Members of the Court, to the effect of the
specific saying statute,
Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Court will
note that 1103(a), the specific statute, refers only to the
word "prosecutions."

It does not us® the words "penalty,

forfeiture, or liability."

And the contention of the

petitioners resolves itself, we suggest, based upon the
meaning of the word "prosecution."
The Government urges that notwithstanding the
wording of the 7237(d), that both probation, the discretion
of the Court to order a suspension of sentence and finally
parole under 18 U. S. Code 4202 is part of the prosecution,
as the word is used in Section 1103(a).

We disagree, and

there are reasons both from a policy point of view as well
as from a conceptual point of view which we submit in support
of our argument.
The cases of Affronti and Murray and finally
Ellenbogen, which are cited on page 14 of our brief and
they are cited as wall in the United States brief, all show
that a court does have authority following the imposition of
sentence and prior to the execution of the sentence to grant

9

probation and to suspend sentence.

Thus, although it did not

take place in this case .and it does not take place in most
cases, as the Solicitor General correctly points out, had
the district court here, for example, sentenced these
defendants to five years, not suspended sentence, assuming that
he had the power to do so, and thereafter before incarceration
and while the case was not on appeal, for example, to the
Court of Appeals, if there had been some reason for delay in
execution of the sentence,

before execution of the sentence,

he had then suspended sentence and granted probation, he
would have been within the authority which appears very
plainly in Affront! and Murray and in the Second Circuit
case, Ellenbcgen, where that actually took place.
The Government's brief correctly points out that,
as Ellenbogen says, normally the imposition of probation and
the suspension of sentence should normally take place at the
time of sentence.

But the Court has authority, nevertheless,

to suspend and to grant probation during that interval, if
there is an interval, between imposition of sentence and
execution.
Thus, sentence being in 99 percent of the cases,
as Berman indicates, which is also cited on page 14 of our
case, the judgment sentence has concluded, we suggest, the»
prosecution as of the time that it is imposed.

Sentence, of

course, as we suggest, looks to the past and the judgment

10

looks to the past.

It looks to the determination of guilt.

It looks to the consideration which the trial judge takes
into account in determining the term of imprisonment or the
amount of the fine.

It looks to the prior criminal record,

if any, of the defendant or, for that matter, to whatever
good work he has done in his life.

Whereas, probation looks

to the future? probation as an act of grace looks to the
opportunity which the defendant may have to rehabilitate
himself while, instead of being incarcerated, through the
grace of the court and through the act of grace, which is the
suspension of sentence and probation, he finds himself, to
use the colloquial phrase, on the street rather than
incarcerated.

So that these are two separate concepts, and

the difference, may it please the Court, between probation
and suspended sentence as an act of grace, on the one hand,
and the imposition of a term of years, on the other hand, as
policy matters, is consistent with what we've urged and the
Affront! and Murray and Ellenbogen cases show, namely, that
there is a difference conceptually between sentence and the
discretion of the court or its exercise in granting probation
and in suspending sentence.
Q

What about parole?

MR. HOMANS:
0

With respect to parole—

On existing cases that were final at the time

the act was passed, sentences were being served under the old

11
law.

A prisoner wouldn’t be subject to parole.

Is ha under

the new law?
MR. HOMANSs

This case, may it please the Court,

and 1 am not trying to hedge, does not reach that because,
of course, we were sentenced after the repeal.
Q

I know, but your argument is that probation

isn't part of either prosecution or sentence.
MR. HOMANSs

Tfes, sir.

the question is even clearer.

As to parole, we suggest

Under the language of this

Court in Morrissey against Brewer, which is cited on page 13
of our brief, U. S. 471 at page 430, the Court said parole
arises after the and of the criminal prosecution, including
imposition of sentence.

Therefore, even more clearly than

is the case in probation and the—
\

Q
day?

Were we saying any more than night follows

That was merely an observation about the chronological

events.
MR. HOMANS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But in each case, probation and parole, a

sentence is pronounced, is it not?
MR. HOMANS:

h sentence has been pronounced, yes,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

They are each under a sentence, and perhaps

physically a difference is that the release begins
immediately

on probation, and it's deferred in parole.

12
MRo HOMANSs

Yes,, sir.

There are those similarities

and , of course, by saying the parole issue is stronger than
the probation issue, we certainly do not concede the
probation issue.

But 1 would suggest, Mr. Chief

Justice,

that with respect to parole, the determination, for example,
of when parole shall be granted except in the exception
provided by 4208(a) , is in an. executive rather than a—at
least for federal purpose—is in executive rather than a
judicial body, the board of parole, that the matter, except
again in the case of the exception in 4208(a), the matter
is not a. judicial matter, it is not in the control of the
court but is in control of the executive body, and this is
consistent with the purpose of parole, to see how the man
does during the time he has been incarcerated and taking
into consideration his background and thereafter give him
the opportunity to remain in a form of custody in what the
Court called a variation in Morrissey against Brewer upon
imprisonment but again on the street under supervision of
his parole officer until the time of his original term has
finished.
So that in that sense, may it please the Court,
it is like probation in that he has a form of supervision
by an employee of the executive, the parole officer.

But

the determination is made completely separately from the
original determination made by the court as to the term of

13
years or the fine in the few cases where there are fines,
the terra of years which the defendant will serve.

So that

again, may it please the Court, we would suggest that the
concepts are entirely different, whether you call parole an
act

of grace or whatever terminology one puts on it.
Nevertheless, there are completely different

considerations going into whether a man is paroled than the
sentence imposed upon him, whether that sentence is to be
suspended or served.
Q

Coming back to that for the moment--

Rather than calling it an act of grace,

would it not be more accurata to say that it is a matter of
sound judicial discretion?
MR. HOMANS:

With all respect, may it please the

Court, parole except—
Q

No, I am treating probation now, probation.

MR. HOMANS:

Probation, oh, yes, sir, there is no

question but that the exercise of discretion to grant
probation and to suspend sentence certainly is in the
exercise of sound judicial discretion, but it comes, may it
please the Court, after the court has already determined
this man shall serve so many years.

The court then comes to

the question of whether it shall exercise its discretion to
grant probation coupled with a suspended sentence or a
suspension of the sentence which has already been ordered.
And as Nageiberg case indicates on page—-which we cite—on

14
page 16, if in the unhappy event the probation is eventually
revoked and the sentence is ordered to be served at some
future time during the period of the service of -the probation
term, then, to quote the Court, the original term, although
suspended “informs the judge who revokes probation of what
the trial judge thought an appropriate prison term would foe»"
In that case, which is helpful for our purposes,
in that case one judge had imposed the original sentence and
suspended it,

A second judge revoked the probation and

ordered service of the sentence.

And the concept voiced by

the Court of Appeals in that case was that what was to be
done by the second judge, so far as imprisonment was
concerned, was already decided by the first judge, indicating
again the separation between the two concepts.
Q

Mr. Homans, if you put it in terms of more

or less lay understanding rather than strictly legal concepts,
would it not be fair to say that when one says a person can
be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of
parole, that the reference to without possibility of parole
is really a modification or adjective describing the form
of sentence?
MR. HOMANS:

Perhaps to a lay person, not

understanding the difference in concepts, the without
possibility of parole, Your Honor, would normally, as I
understand it, it resulted from authority of a statute, such

15
as in this case 7237(d) for the court to make that order»
And., again may it please the Court, similarly to the power of
the federal court given by 4208(a)

to use statutory

authority either to order that parole be granted as the case
in 4208(a) at an earlier time or as in the case Your Honor
poses to say again under statutory authority that no parole
shall ever be given»

Again may it please the Court,- the

judiciary or the particular judges involved in that decision.
But the decision, 1 would suggest, is not part of the
sentence for the purposes we5re dealing with sentence

here,

may it please the Court.
I agree, Your Honor, and there is perhaps a logical
inconsistency between the case Your Honor poses and the
position we take here, which is also present, as I say, in
the case of 4208(a).

But we would suggest that on the basis

of the language of this Court in the Berman case, in the
Roberts case, in the many other cases which have dealt with
the differences between either probation or parole, on the
one hand, and the power of the Court to sentence to a term of
years and to fine or a fine on the other, that so far as the
word "prosecution” is concerned in Section 1103(a), the
specific saving statute, that the prosecution has ended, may
it please the Court, with the imposition of sentence,
regardless of what takes place afterwards in terms either of
the exercise of probation or suspension of sentence

16

discretion or even

labor

the grant or refusal of

parole by a parole board .
I apologia© for a rather long-winded answer.
Q

Do you recognise the difference that

probation is judicial and parole is executive?
MR. HOMANS:

At least in the federal jurisdiction

„

Your Honor, and certainly in all jurisdictions it is an
administrative decision, although in some state jurisdictions
the—
Q

This is federal.

MR. HOMANS:
Q

Certainly here—

Parole is strictly executive.

MR. HOMANS;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Strictly executive, yes, Your Honor.

And do you also say that probation is

strictly judicial?
MR. HOMANS;

A judicial exercise of discretion,

yes, Your Honor.
Q

Why is that not part of the sentence?

MR. HOMANS;

The reason, may it please, it is not

part of the sentence is because judge has already at the time
that he makes the decision conceptually, at the time he
makes the decision to suspend sentence and to grant
probation, has made the decision that this man shall serve
two or three or four years, and the man is liable to serve
that time whether he is given probation or a suspended

17
sentence or not.
Q

He is liable'—

Which means it is a sentence.

MR. HOMANS:
Q

It means it is a sentence—

And the probation is a part of his sentence.

MR. HOMANS:

I would not say so, Your Honor, for

the purposes of the statute here which-—
Q

Suppose the judge gives him five years in

another type of case, not a dove case, and within the
statutory period because the man says 1' made a mistake, I am
going to cut it to three.

That's a sentence.

The second one

is a sentence, is it not?
MR. HOMANS:

The second one is reduction, as I

understand it, under Rule 35, which is quite different.
Q

Is it a sentence?

MR. ROMANS:

Yes, sir, that goes into the

sentencing process, the reduction of sentence.
Q

Is not anything the judge does after

conviction within the sentencing part?
MR. HOMANS:
Q

No, sir.

Why not?

MR. HOMANS:

It may be part of the "sentencing

process," using the words in a rather broad sense.

But I

would suggest that what is at issue here is the meaning of the
word prosecution.
Q

You agree that the prosecution includes

13
sentencing?
MR. HOMANS:
Q

Do you agree on that?

MR. HOMANS:
Q

“-sentence.

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that not the end of your case?

MR. HOMANS;
Q

f

It includes—

I—

I thought you said a minute ago the probation

was a part of the sentencing.
MR. HOMANS:

No, sir.

I said, may it please the

Court, that it is part of the—using the language rather
loosely—.normally part of the sentencing process.

But, as

we have indicated, may it please the Court, by the citation
of Affront! and Murray and Ellenbogen, which appear on page
14 of the brief, the sentence may take place and be followed
after an interval of time under Section 3651, which is the
probation statute, may be followed after an interval of time,
even though sentence was not originally suspended and
probation not originally granted.

Sentence may be followed

after a ten-day or a month or whatever interval of time
before execution occurs.

And certainly from that point of

view, may it please the Court, the sentence has taken place
at the time that the man is told, "You are sentenced to five
years in jail," period, without any further words of the court
as to whether the sentence is suspended or probation given.
Then to give the obverse of the hypothesis Your

19
Honor posed, if the judge after, for example, a month prior
to the time that the sentence is executed thinks to himself,
“Well, perhaps this sentence should have been suspended," at
the end of that 30 days, providing execution of the sentence
is not started, he has the power and the authority to
exercise his discretion to suspend and grant probation for
a period of years.
G

Assume that this record showed that at the

time of sentencing there had been arguments urging probation,
with all the usual reasons that may be advanced.

And the

judge said, "I have"—-and this is all on the record and in
the record when the case comes on review—"I have considered
the arguments and the reasons advanced for probation, and X
conclude that this is not a proper case for granting
probation because of the past history of this defendant."
Where would you be then?
MR. HOMANS:

If that had taken place, may it please

the Court, X think it is unlikely that we would be here,
although—
Q

Now, all of those events have preceded the

sentence, have they not?
MR. HOMANS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Enlighten me on how that then is not part of

the sentencing process.
MR. HOMANS:

As I say, Mr. Chief Justice, using

20

the words "sentencing process5’ as imposing all of the matters
which the trial judge is considering either at the time he
imposes the sentence of years or during that time, including
an interval following that, that is part of the sentencing
process»

But, as the word is used, the sentence is the

judgment in the Berman case which we cite»
The prosecution, may it please the Court, has
terminated with the judgment of the Court imposing a sentence
of years»

And what takes place after that so far as probation,

suspended sentence, or parole, we would suggest is not part
of the "prosecution»"
Q

But in my hypothesis the events have taken

place before the sentence and the judgment»
MR, HOMANSs

The attorneys have made the arguments,

may it please the Court, and obviously the judge has considered
them.

But from the point of view of the statute, as it has

been interpreted, this is the difficulty—if I can interrupt
myself for a moment—with this—-not the difficulty, because
many cases turn on statutory language.

But we suggest very

strongly that whatever may be the practical effect and
whatever different ways judges and lai^yers may deal with the
questions involved here, that from the point of view of the
way the statutes read, and particularly the wording of the
statute insofar as one statute refers to prosecution and
another statute refers to penalty, forfeiture, or liability,

21

that this is a question of* in this case, as to how these
statutes are to be interpreted.
I would ask the Court—thank you, Your Honor.
Q

You may finish.

MR. HOMANS;

Oh, I would ask the Court to consider

the arguments in the brief with respect to the applicability
of 1 United States Code, Section 109.

I have not made that

argument this morning but thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Lacovara.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LACOVARA;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

pleas® the Court;
I must confess to being somewhat perplexed by the
arguments that have been advanced, including some of the
arguments that have been made in lower court decisions on the
question that is

before the Court this morning.

As the

Government sees the case, it does not involve for the Court's
decision the question, What is the nature of the probation
decision or the pr-obation process?

It does not involve the

question of the exercise of executive discretion to grant
parole.
What the Court has before it, in our view, is a
relatively straightforward question of legislative intent.

22
This is a case involving two saving statutes, and the
question is not, What, is the nature of probation? or What is
the nature of parole?, but rather when Congress has said
that by reason of engaging in certain illegal conduct a person
is absolutely ineligible for probation and cannot even be
considered for parole, that legislative direction is part of
the punishment for engaging in that prohibited conduct»

If

the answer to that question is yes, if that absolute
legislative bar to the exercise of judicial discretion or
executive clemency is considered a penalty or punishment,
then we submit that the answer to the ultimate question
before the Court this morning is clear, that the saving
statute, both the saving statute in Title 1 and the specific
clause that Congress included in the 1970 act operate to
preserve these bans on probation and parole.
Therefore, I will not—
Q

Does this case involve parole?

MR. LACQVARA:

One of the issues that could be

raised,. Mr* Chief Justice, is whether the parole question is
right.

The four petitioners in this case have just been

sentenced.

They are still on bail, I understand.

And

although the probation decision or the inability to qualify
for probation is clearly raised, there is a question about
the rightness of the parole decision.
The Government acquiesced in the petition for

23
certiorari primarily because of the importance of the parole
decision»

And I would submit that the issue is a live one»,

because the way the system actually operates, the Board of
Parole is now considering as eligible for parole only
defendants who have been sentenced in the Seventh and the
Ninth Circuits for narcotics offenses because the courts of
appeals in the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have held that
people sentenced after May 1, 1971 are to be considered
eligible.

Since the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

as well as other circuit courts have held that parole
eligibility is not eliminated, the Parole Board will not be
considering any people sentenced in those circuits for
parole.
The petitioners filed a motion before the First
Circuit to remand their case to the district judge for him to
exercise probation discretion and also to certify whether
they should be eligible for parole.

If the district judge

has the power to determine that they are eligible for parole,
the Parole Board—and certifies that on hi.s judgment—the
Parole Board will respect that judgment,
Q

Is there any way of knowing that the district

judge did not consider and reject probation?

Do we know one

way or the other?
MR. LACOVARAs
the Court,

The sentencing hearing is not before

That transcript is not available.,

We have*

24
suggested in our brief that there is a real possibility that
the petitioners in this case may have been given probation
if Judge Wyzanski had the power to do that* and we point
simply to the fact that he did sentence them to the
minimum sentence that was mandatory under the pre-1970 law*
and also three of the petitioners violated the Gun Control
Act and Judge Wyzanski placed the three petitioners who were
convicted on those offenses on probation.

And* therefore*

we have suggested that since the record is not clear that he
has made a conscious decision on probation* if Judge Wyzanski
has the power that petitioners press for* then we think that
the remedy that they sought in the Court of Appeals, remand
for the purpose of allowing him to consider probation or
parole, would be an appropriate remedy.
The question as we see it is basically whether the
ineligibility for probation and parole, which was
unquestionably contained in the Internal Revenue Code*
Section 7237(d), until its repeal in May of 1971, constituted
a part of the penalty for engaging in sales of narcotics, the
offense of which these petitioners have been convicted.
The interpretation of the savings clauses that are
before the Court will be the ultimate question.

But we

think in order to apply the language of the saving clause
it is important to begin by determining what is the nature of
the no-probation, no-parole decision that Congress has made

25
for narcotics traffickers„
In our brief we have set out in some detail the
legislative history surrounding the introduction of the noparole, no-probation directive in the statute, and we think
that it underscores quite vividly that Congress was adding
an additional penalty in the sense that Mr» Justice Rehnquist
before said a life sentence without parole is a modified
penalty that is more severe than a simple life sentence»
This, we submit, is exactly what Congress has
shown it was doing when it added the no-probation, no-parole
provisions and applied them to specific kinds of illegal
conduct violative of the narcotics laws.
The no-probation and no-suspension~of-sentence
provisions first came into the narcotics laws in the 1951
Boggs Act, which then applied only to smuggling of heroin
into the United States and the ban on judicial grant of
probation or the suspension of sentence applied in 1951 only
to second or subsequent offenders.
In 1956, however, in the Narcotics Control Act of
that year, which is generally recognized to have been a very
severe and harsh statute, Congress after hearing a consider­
able amount of testimony about the narcotics statute,
tightened the screws.

And what Congress did was to apply the

no-probation provision not only to second offenders involved
in narcotics smuggling, but applied the ban on probation even

26
to first offenders and applied that prohibition not just to
smugglers but to anyone who dispensed, narcotics in violation
of federal law.
In addition, in 1956, Congress added the ban on
parole, making an offender convicted of these narcotics
violations absolutely ineligible for parole.

Congress

denied district judges the discretion to place people on
probation and it denied the parole board the discretion to
release them before the expiration of their sentence.
We have quoted some of the relevant excerpts from
the legislative history surrounding the 1956 legislation at
pages 12 through 14 of our brief.

And the very language

that was used by the x^itnesses and by the Congressional
committees recommending this legislation shox^s that Congress
intended these prohibitions to be an inherent and intrinsic
part of the penalty for engaging in narcotics trafficking.
Thus, net only is there a mandatory minimum sentence of five
years for trafficking in narcotics, which all courts of
appeals and petitioners agree has been saved by the saving
statute for pre-repeal violations, even if they are not
sentenced until after the repeal of the 1956 act.

But the

no-probation, no-parole directive by Congress was similarly
intended to be part of the penalty that was to attach
automatically upon conviction of these offenses, just as the
mandatory minimum sentence.

27
In 1970, when Congress passed the comprehensive
drug abuse and control act and repealed the various
scattered provisions of the narcotics laws, it eliminated
the absolute ineligibility for probation or parole that
existed under the 1956 legislation.

But it so in a somewhat

qualified way and for reasons which are important in
answering the question before the Court.
The decision to eliminate the absolute ineligibility
for probation and parole that was contained in Section 7237(d)
was not, we submit, an exercise of legislative clemency; it
was not an effort to get soft on the narcotics problem.

What

Congress was doing in reorganising the entire drug control
structure was to make a somewhat more refined classification.
Even under the 1970 legislation, Congress has
provided a category of narcotics offenders who will not be
eligible for probation and who will not be eligible for
parole.

In fact, over the opposition of certain witnesses,

Congress even expanded that absolute prohibition.

As I

mentioned, the 1956 statutes had applied only to trafficking
in narcotics.

Section 848 now of Tit3.e 21, which punishes

engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in the drug
field, applies to engaging in any kind of drug traffic,
including trafficking in LSD, amphetamines, and barbiturates.
In that statute, Congress has raised the mandatory
minimum penalty from five years to ten years, has increased

28

the outer limit from 20 years, as under the statute which
petitioners violated, to life imprisonment, added an
additional special parole term, increased the fine to be
imposed, and provided for forfeiture*
The reason I am going into these statutes, which
conceivably are not directly applicable to petitioners
because they didn’t become effective until two months after
they committed their violations, is that it shows what
Congress was trying to do in 1970*

It was not trying to do

what petitioners’ argument would have th© effect of doing,
and that is to wipe out, to remit in part, some of the very
severe penalties that attach to people who violated the pre1970 laws.
What Congress was doing was redirecting its
focus and refining the categories of people who would be
punished in this severe way.
Q

Mr. Lacovara, just as a matter of curiosity,

I know often legislation is made effective in the future,
but why so long here, some seven months, I think it was,
almost?
MR. LACOVARA;

As I mentioned, Mr. Justice, this

was a reform, a revision, of the entire narcotics structure.
It affected statutes that were scattered throughout the
United States Code, and it also provided for extensive
administrative changes.

Enforcement responsibilities were

29
being transferred# a whole new administrative system, of
classifying different dangerous drugs into various
schedules was being set up*

So# Congress provided that long

lead time of sir months in order to make sure that all of the
actors in the system would have an adequate amount of time to
familiarise themselves with the changes that were being made
and to bring the operational machinery into line so that it
would be effective—effective in a practical as well as a
legal sense—on May 1# 1971.
Q

For this kind of statute» it is rather hard

on the individual concerned when May 1 comes down and forms
the barriers—
MR. LACOVARA:
around.

Well# no# X think that turns it

Up until May 1# 1971# the provisions of the old law

were in force.

Those were the provisions that the petitioners

violated# and it is unquestioned that those provisions were
the ones—and we contend still are the ones—-that provided
a minimum sentence of five years in jail and forbade the
suspension of sentence or the grant of probation for
consideration of parole.
So# we are not talking about retroactively
applying the—
Q

Precisely# that is my point# that Congress has

made its determination in October# made it effective next May#
and this individual and others are caught in that interim

30

period»

But that is neither here nor there»
MR. LACOVARAs

I think it is either here or there,

because that is the dilemma that the lower courts have been
wrestling with.

There is clearly an anomaly, at the very

least, in having to draw a line

in saying that someone who

committed a violation two months before the effective date
is not going to be allowed consideration for probation, is
not going to be eligible for parole, but somebody who commits
his violation after May 1st will be eligible for these
considerations, unless he is engaged in a continuing
criminal enterprise»
But this is really an example of Congress having
to draw a line somewhere»
earlier stage.

It could have drawn a line at an

But we submit the legislative history shows

it did not»
Q

The Ninth Circuit's view does not avoid the

necessity of line drawing, does it?
MR. LACOVARA:

No, sir.

As we underscore in our

brief, there is just as much challenge to the lines they have
drawn.

In a parole board case, the Noriega case, which we

have cited on page 31 of our brief, footnote 13, the Ninth
Circuit has—excuse me, Noriega is page 23 and 24.

The Ninth

Circuit has drawn the line at the date of sentencing,
irrespective of the date the violation took place.

The

Ninth Circuit says if you are sentenced after May 1, 1971,

31
you are eligible for probation or parole»

But if, as might

have happened in this case, the petitioners were tried more
promptly and were sentenced immediately, the Ninth Circuit
would say, even though the new law has come into effect,
nevertheless these petitioners are not eligible for
probation or for parole»
What we say is that the Ninth Circuit has
%

substituted its judgment on where the line should have been
drawn and might have been drawn for what we think is the
legislative judgment.

And choosing among options that are

otherwise reasonable is emphatically a legislative judgment.
But in this kind of setting we think it is a particularly
reasonable judgment.

The policy underlying the ex post facto

clause, for example, is one that makes the consequences of
conduct turn not on the time the conduct is adjudicated or
sentenced but on the time the conduct was permitted, and
this we say is exactly what Congress has done.
If you committed your violation under the old law,
the old law applies.

If you committed a violation under the

new lav/, the new statute applies.
The saving statutes are reflective of that national
policy.

The basic saving statute in Title 1 dates from 1871,

and it provides what we think is fundamental national
policy on the interpretation of the effectiveness of statutes.
It provides in very broad terms that the repeal of any

32
statute .shall not have fcha effect to release or extinguish
any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such
statute.

So, here we come back to the date upon which the

penalty was incurred, which would be the date of the
violation, unless the repealing act expressly so provides.
Clearly, the 1970 act has not expressly provided for the
extinguishment of what we think is pcirt of the penalty for
these violations.

But, on the contrary, the statute is to
*.

be treated as still remaining in force for preserving a
proper civil action or prosecution to enforce that penalty.
There has been a considerable amount of discussion
in the brief about what those words "penalty, liability or
forfeiture'1 mean.

In the first case that this Court had to

consider that question, the Reisinger case in 1888, the
Court applied the statute to a criminal case which--by the
way, the statute there had been repealed before the
indictment was returned, and the repealing statute itself,
just as in our case, had its own saving

clause, which was

much narrower than the general saving clause.

It applied

only by terms to saving prosecutions that had already been
commenced at the time of the repealer.
This Court nevertheless said that the general
saving statute applies in addition, that that narrower focus
in the specific saving clause is not to be construed as an
i

express provision to the contrary, and that the words

33
"penalty* forfeiture or liability"--and this is quoted on
page 26 of our brief—were intended by -Congress to be
synonymous with the term "punishment * and were used by
Congress to include all forms of punishment for crime.
That is why we submit today the general saving
statute* 1 United States Code 109* operates to save the
applicability of the no-probation* no-parole provisions of
Section 7237(d),

These* we believe and we argue this in

our brief * were part of the penalty that Congress created
for these violations and as part of the penalty or the
punishment* they are saved by the general saving statute.
The specific saving clause also points in the same
direction* as in Reisinger and the Great Northern Railway
case* which also involved a more limited specific saving
clause* which this Court said did not cut back on the general
saving clause and allowed a subsequently returned criminal
indictment to be prosecuted.
The specific saving clause here reiterates the
same national policy; although the language is difference*
we think the thrust is the same.

And Congress in the

specific saving clause says that prosecutions for any
violation of lav? occurring prior to the date—Mr. Justice
Blackmun* here again is the question of focus on the date of
the violation* although that is not the only focus the Congress
might have provided for.

But these prosecutions shall not be

34
effected toy the repeals or abated by reason thereof.

It does

not take much extravagant argument to show that the
punishment for an offense is part of the prosecution for it.
Prosecution is not just an academic exercise.

And

certainly, as I believe petitioners have conceded and the
lower courts have certainly held, the sentence prescribed for
a violation is part of the prosecution for that violation
within the meaning of this kind of saving clause.
And if our interpretation of the legislative
history is correct, the no-probation, no-parole provisions
are part of the penalty that operate automatically, attach
automatically

upon conviction,then those prohibitions are

part of the sentence

or

part of the prosecution for the

offenses that took place and are preserved.
I think one illustration of the point that I am
trying to make, that the ban on probation and parole is part
of the penalty, part of the punishment that Congress has
fixed for violation of a statute, is that the courts of
appeals are now virtually unanimous in holding that a guilty
plea entered to one of these narcotics offenses is
involuntary because without sufficient knowledge, unless the
defendant who pleaded guilty not only knew about the minimum
sentence, the mandatory minimum sentence, but also knew that
upon conviction he would be ineligible for probation and
would be ineligible for parole.

And the rationale that the

35

courts of appeal have followed in reaching that result is

,

that unlike certain other collateral consequences of
criminal convictions, the ineligibility for probation and
parole are attached to the very violation itself in the same
sense that the prison sentence is a consequence of a plea»
For all these reasons, v/e submit that the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit has reached the proper
result in holding that violations of the pre-May 1, 1971
drug laws are to be punished as if those laws are still in
effect and for all legal purposes under the saving statutes
they are to be considered in force»
