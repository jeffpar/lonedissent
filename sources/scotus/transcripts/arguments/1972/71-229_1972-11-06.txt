MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first in No. 71-229, United States against Dionisio.
Mr. Lacovara, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LACOVARA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
This case3 United States against Dionisio and the
next case on the Court’s calendar this morning, United States
against Mara, both raise important questions about the ability
of federal grand juries to obtain exemplar evidence from
recalcitrant witnesses.
Both cases are here on writs of certiorari applied
for by the United States to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
In this case, the proceedings began when a special
federal grand jury sitting in the northern

district of

Illinois, the special February, 1971 grand jury, supoenaed
.Mr. Dionisio and approximately 20 others in a gambling
investigation that the special grand jury was conducting.
Mr. Dionisio

and others were ordered by the grand jury to

submit to them what would be the reading of a transcript over
. .a telephone connected to a recording device.
Mr. Dionisio refused to give the exemplars as

Ii

directed by the grand jury foreman, as did other grand jury
witnesses, and the government thereafter filed

petitions to

obtain court orders to compel the furnishing of the voice
exemplar,
The government’s petition against Mr. Dionisio
alleged that the special grand jury was investigating vio­
lations of federal criminal statutes, that the grand jury
thought it necessary and essential to obtain a voice exemplar
of Mr. Dionislo * s voice on the telephone for the:-sole purpose
of comparing his voice as recorded with voices intercepted
pursuant to court orders issued by the federal '.'district
court.

"y
The government also alleged that the transcript
'•

'i

that Mr. Dionision had been asked to read was special grand
jury exhibit 13, which the petition stated consisted of
names, numbers and races, names of horses, numbers of horses
•and races and

certain other informat on.

The. hearing on the petition in this matter as well
as' petitions with respect to the other 20 or so recalcitrant
witnesses was held before Chief Judge Robson of the district
court and at that hearing it was brought out that

what the

government was seeking was compliance with what was termed a
"reasonable order" of the grand jury and this was explained to
mean that if an exemar that was clear was given, only one
exemplar would be necessary but on the basis of similar

requests several days earlier, exemplars had been given by
other- witnesses and the time consumed had been no more than
10 or 20 minutes that the government would preserve any and
all original examplars for subsequent comparison and expert
analysis, including by the defense and that counsel could be
present during the taking of the exemplars because the
expected procedure would be that the exemplar would be given
before a specially designated agent of the grand jury outside
the grand jury room.
Chief Judge Hobson entered, orders directing each of
the witnesses including Mr. Dlonlsio to provide the exemplars.
Nineteen of the 21 witnesses did provide the exemplars under
court order.

Mr. Diohisio and one other witness whose

petition was ultimately dismissed by the government refused to
give the exemplars, asserting fourth and fifth amendment
\

defenses.
The court

entered an opinion which is reprinted in

the appendix to our certiorari petition in which both the
fourth amendment and the fifth amendment claims, were
rejected.

On the fourth amendment issue, Chief Judge Robson

held that since the grand jury subpoenas were lawful, the
witnesses were properly subject to these directions, were not
in unlawful detention within the meaning of this court13
position in Davis against Mississippi and relying on this
court’s decisions in Gilbert, Wade and other cases, held that

6
no fifth amendment values are impinged upon by requiring a
person to give exemplars.
When Mr. Dlonisio

refused in open court to give

the exemplars9 he was committed for contempt until he
complied with the order or until the expiration of 18 months
which was the maximum statutory imprisonment for civil
contempt.
On appeal after Mr. Dionislon had been released on
bond by the seventh circuits, the court of appeals rejected
fifth amendment claims as well as any possible sixth
amendment claim but found that the fourth amendment defense
was a valid one.
The court ruled that before a grand jury may compel
a witness before It to give exemplars of his voice the
government must make an affirmative factual showing
this request is reasonable.

that

The court apparently believed

that the petition and the hearing that was held on the
government petition did not satisfy that reasonableness
request and the court reversed the contempt judgment.
The ground for decision by the Seventh Circuit was
essentially that exemplars may be covered by the fourth
amendments relying here on the same case that the district
court had found not applicable, Davis against Mississippi
and also that the fourth amendment applies to grand jury
proceedings and the court relied on one or two decisions

7
in this court in which the court stated that grand jury
supoenas for the production of documents might he so broad
and. Ill-defined as to constitute an unreasonable search.
The government petitioned for rehearing en banc
and that was

denied by a five to three vote and In August

of 1371 we filed a petition for certiorari.

In.May of 1972,

after we had filed a supplemental memorandum calling to the
court's attention an intervening decision by Chief Judge
Friendly of the Second Circuit which had explicitly rejected
the rationale in the Dionisio case, the court granted
certiorari.
The Issue, then, in this first case is whether,
when a grand jury witness has been properly called before an
investigating grand jury, the fourth amendment requires that
before a witness can be compelled to give exemplars of his
voice or, as in Mara.» exemplars of his handwriting, the
government must make an affirmative, factual showing that this
request is reasonable.
It is the government’s petition — position— that
no such requirement of affirmative, factual showing of
reasonableness is necessary tnder the fourth amendment and
that the decision below

constitutes a departure from

settled principles of grand jury practice and settled prin­
ciples of the application of the fourth amendment.
We think the appropriate place to start in this

8
case

— as Chief Judge Friendly in the Schwartz

case has

done — is with the nature of the grand Jury itself»

There is

not need» X think, for us to rehearse at any great length the
principles

governing grand jury investigations, since only

last terra the court had a number of such cases before it.
But, briefly, the relevant context here Is this2

A

grand jury is a touchstone of the criminal process under the
federal system since only a grand jury can Initiate felony
prosecutions.

The grand jury, for several hundred years,

has had the completely undisputed right to compulsory process.
This court has explained that complusory process involves not
only the justifiable demand that every witness appear before
the grand jury, but that every witness, unless his testimony
is privileged, must testify before the grand jury in its
search for truth.
«

Mow, last term, in a decision which has been
rendered by this court since the Seventh Circuit®s decision
in the two cases before the court this morning, the court
rejected the very kind of preliminary showing that the Seventh
Circuit has imposed in these eases»

In

Branaburg» Caldwell

and Pappas it will be recalled, where important first
amendment rights were unquestionably involved, as none of the
justices of the court disputed, the court nevertheless said
that in light of the historic function of the grand jury,
even where It was possible that there might be some

9
collateral impact on first amendment values, nevertheless a
newsman subpoenaed before a grand jury had an obligation to
appear and had an obligation to testify and in rendering
that decision the court explicitly rejected the suggestion
that even

in order to protect these first amendment rights

some preliminary showing should be made before the newsman
was compelled to respond to the subpoena.
The showing that was suggested by the lower courts
arid by the dissent in Branaburg was remarkably similar to the
showing of reasonableness that the Seventh Circuit has
posed in th

and it is our position that a showing

in this context was no more justified than in the Bransburg,
s

Caldwell and Pappas context.

The second case this

Circuit of the nature of the proceeding that mustybe held to
demonstrate reasonableness and the substantive content of the
reasonableness.

But if this court decides that the Seventh

Circuit erred in Dionisio in saying that there is this kind
of constitutional requirement., the second case,fin our
judgment, becomes academic.
The contention by Seventh Circuit, which is, of

10
course9 defended by respondents In these cases is that
compelling a witness to provide this kind of exemplar
evidence is covered by the fourth amendment, even though,
as the Seventh Circuit itself has concededs the fourth
amendment, governing unreasonable seizures of persons, does
not apply to summoning a witness before a grand Jury.

It has

Isn't it?

11
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, X can answer that question by

saying that the petition that the government filed and the
order that was entered in both of these cases did not require
that the evidence, the testimony, if you will, be given
outside the grand jury room.

This was the procedure that the

government proposed so that counsel could be present during
the taking of the exemplar.

Did he ever refuse to testify before the grand jury pursuant
to a grand jury subpoena?
MR. LACOVARA:

My answer to that question, and X

I think the reading of

the transcript of the hearing before Chief Judge Robson will
show that the orders that were being entered were to direct
the witnesses to give these exemplars and at the time they
were toeing entered and argued on the merits, it was not clear
to Judge Robson that the procedure that was expected for
purposes of defense counsel being in attendance was to have
a
them given before/specially designated agent of the grand
jury outside the grand jury room tout what Judge Robson asked
counsel and the respondent in each of these cases was, “Will
you give the exemplars?”
outside the grand jury

It was not, "Will you give them
room?"

And as I say, the order that

was entered was not limited to giving them outside the grand
jury room and there would have toeen no contempt here.
Q

Well, what — he didn't refuse to answer any

15
questions in the grand, jury room, did he?
MR. LACGVARA2

Well* he refused, while in the grand

jury room, to give exemplars.
Q

Did he refuse any questions?

MR. LACOVARA:

No,

The only evidence that he was asked

to give in the grand jury room by the grand jury was the
exemplar evidence.
On this point, I reiterate that the order that was
entered by Chief Judge Robson and the order that was asked
for by the government provided for the giving of exemplars,
either before and to the grand jury or to a specially desig­
nated agent of the grand jury who had been sworn by the grand
jury previously to receive this evidence so that, as X say,
there was also no objection, on the ground that this was beyond
the power of the grand jury to do and we, 3uggaat,e,d- the case
of O'Brien against the United States in 339d«S. as dispositive
..of-this point-since this objection was not made by the witness.
This was not the basis for his objection and if that objection
>■ \«

had been made, the government, of course, would have been
•quite willing to receive the exemplars in the grand jury room/
But as the transcript of the hearing makes clear, Mr. Justice
Marshall, the government counsel said that the procedure that
was contemplated was outside the grand jury room so that
respondent * s counsel could be present at the talcing of these
exemplars and that, in fact, is the procedure that was

16
followed, j. am told., by the 19 witnesses who did provide the
exemplars.
Q

As a matter of fact, the witnesses don*t affect

this case at all, do they?
MR, LACOVARA:

Ho, sir, but I am trying to set the

contest in which this cams up to show that it was not thought
material to the obligation or lack of obligation of
Mr. Dionisio to give these exemplars that the grand jury, for
other purposes, directed him to provide the exemplars to its
agent down the hall.
Q

That was not an —

who was the agent?

MR. LACOVARA:

He was an agent of the FBI sworn

by the grand jury to receive these exemplars and then
testify what further processing they received.
Q

So it is like my hypothetical.

You go down the

hall and talk to an FBI agent.
MR» LACOVARA:

No, sir, we have a fifth amendment

problem there.
Q

What is the difference?

MR. LACOVARA:

¥a are talking about evidence that

the grand jury — putting aside the location,

or the giving

of the testimony — that we think there is no fifth or fourth
amendment obstacle to the order that was entered
Q

Would you turn your

here,

attention at least to

the bottom of page 9 of the appendix where Mr. Dionis io

'
after

IT
being asked a question, said, "I refuse to give any voice
exemplar based on the rights guaranteed me under the fourth
and fifth amendments.Ef

Now, was that Inside the grand jury

room or outside?
MR* LACOYARA:

That was inside the grand jury

room and that Is the thrust of my position that his refusal
was categorical, Just like the refusal in the Bryan case, which
was also a contempt case and there was never at any time any
objection based on the locale for the giving of the exemplar
and the government would have been quite willing,as the
court order itself reflects, to receive the exemplar in the
grand jury room If the witness did not want counsel present
outside the grand Jury room.
Q

Where is that in the record?

MR, LACOYARA:

That appears In the transcript.

It

is not printed in the appendix but the transcript, I believe,
is before the court and the —
Q

Mr. Laccvara, the Chief Justice was reading

on page nine and then again on page 10 the answer, !,I refuse
to give a voice exemplar based on the rights guaranteed me
under the fourth and fifth amendments."
MR. LACOYARA:
Q

Yes, sir.

No qualification whatsoever.

MR. LACOVARA:

Absolutely none.

I might say that on page 21 of the transcript of

18
the hearing before Chief Judge Robson on February 19ths a
government counsel brought out that this was after one
counsel for another respondent had asked for permission to be
present in the grand jury room when his witness gave the
exemplar under compulsion, and Chief Judge Robson denied that
motion saying that counsel are not allowed in the grand

jury

room and government counsel said, “Your Honors we've antici­
pated that problem and that is why we have set up a
procedure to allow these exemplars to be taken outside of the
grand jury room so that counsel can be present."

That appears

on page 21 of the transcript of the February 19th hearing
and it appears later on that counsel were actually present.
The context that we find ourselves in, then* is one
in which a witness lawfully before the grand jury has been
ordered to give evidence which is essentially evidence that
he carries with him.

This is not even a subpoena duces tecum

to bring in his person effects from somewhere else.

This is

evidence* evidence of his own physical characteristics —
identifying characteristics that he has been ordered to provide
to the grand jury which is no different* we submit, for
fourth amendment purposes than would be compelling him to
give testimonial evidence again assuming no fifth amendment
problem.
The witness, under what we believe to be settled
principles, is obliged to cooperate in the grand jury's

19
investigation in its search for truth by providing whatever
information or evidence he can provide at that time*

In

typical grand jury proceedings, that involves his..formulation
of an answer to a particular question that calls for Infor­
mation that he has within himself.
In this contexts what the witness is asked for is
to give information, evidence, that is similarly important
to the grand jury for its investigation as the petition
alleged and this is also evidence that he has with him at the
time.

It is evidence about his own physical characteristics.

Now, Chief Judge Friendly in the Schwarts case, which rejects
the rationale of the Seventh Circu.it here, says that this
does not implicate any fourth amendment rights at all because
these identifying physical characteristics voice or, in Mara,
handwriting, are not characteristics as to which any person
has a reasonable expectation of privacy and for this reason
in Judge Friendly’s analysis, we are not even talking about
a search or a seizure within fourth amendment terms.
This is simply the requirement of giving a testi­
mony or evidence which is no different from the formulation of
oral responses by a grand jury witness lawfully before the
grand jury.
Q

Do you suppose the grand jury could tell a man

to go over to that table and put your fingerprints on that
ink pad and get a fingerprint of every one of your fingers?

20
Q

Wells we'd have a slightly different analysis

because of the reasonable expectation of privacy but I would
be prepared to say the grand jury could insist on that9 too
and I think that that brings us right to Davis against
Mississippi which is perhaps the heart of the case»
The Seventh Circuit, X think, misunderstood that
and I happy to be able to rely on Chief Judge Friendly as
having correctly, in our view, understood Davis.

In Davis,

the court's analysis was not whether finger prints abstractly
considered are protected by the fourth amendment, whether
there is a right to privacy In a man's fingerprints.

The

analysis there was, as the court formulated the question, can
fingerprints taken in the course of an

unlawful-police

detention be used against a l4-year~old black to convict him
of rape?
We do not have that problem here.
lawfully

before the grand jury.

The witness was

Chief Judge Robson

recognized that that was the determinative fact.oir.

Chief

Judge Friendly has said the same thing and I think the court's
own explanation in Davis„ that there is no prying into
private thoughts or personal information when fingerprints
are obtained supports Judge Friendly's analysis, that this
really is not a search or seizure problem, assuming that the
police — that the government citizen contact

itself is

lawful, as we submit it is under the fourth amendment when a

grand jury process is being used, not a street confrontation
between police and eitisens.
Q

It is your submissions as I understand it,

that the compulsory giving of fingerprints is not of itself
a violation of either the

Q

fourth or the fifth amendment.
Not of itself.

And that the rationale of Davis was that this

during an unlawful detention which violated the

fourth amendment.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes3 sir.

We regard Davis as a taint

cases a Wong Sun kind of ease; whatever evidence he had
given would have been Inadmissable —
Q

And then here there is no unlawful detentions,

there is merely a summoning of a person before the grand
jury.

That is your argument, as I understand it.
MR. LACOVARA:

That Is our positions sir.

If there are no further questions, I should like to
reserve any further time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Lacovara.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN POWERS CROWLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENT
MR. CROWLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The statement of facts as given by the Solicitor is

22
generallj? sufficient.

I would like to add one further thing

which I think adds some dimension to the problem he had
presented.
The witness, Dionisio, refused to give voice
exemplars.

A

witness, Charles Bishop Smith, during the

same investigation, also refused to give voice exemplars.
Mr. Smith, after being held in contempt and after the Seventh
Circuit had reversed his contempt in the same opinion as
here below, Mr. Smith was indicted by the special February
1971 grand jury and after the government's petition for
certiorari had been filed in this case Mr. Smith was
indicted by this grand jury for alleged violations of the
federal laws prohibiting gambling.

And the Solicitor sought

leave of court and obtained pursuant to rule 60 the dismissal
of the petition against Mr. Smith on the grounds that his
voice exemplar was no longer desired since he had been
Indicted.
The wiretap evidence which formed the basis for
Mr. Smith's indictment and presumably formed the basis for
the request for the grand jury exemplars was found by the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois in United States versus Smith efc al to have been
unlawfully obtained and improperly authorized.

That decision,

the government has sought appeal from that decision.
If that decision is affirmed by the Seventh-Circuit

23
of courses then Mr. Dionisio would have an additional reason
for refusal to furnish the exemplars under the principles
set forth in this case and by this court in Gelbard versus
the United States.

Mr. Dion is.1.o was not protected under the fourth amendment
Just to give voice exemplars per se, I believe that under
this court’s opinln in Gelbard, that Mr. Dionislo would have
a right to refuse to give the voice exemplars alleging that
the evidence upon which the grand jury sought the exemplars
was unconstitutionally obtained.

At least it might constitute

just cause for refusal to answer.
Q

Well, if this court sustains his contempt

conviction, how does he do that?
MR. CROWLEY:

No, your Honor, if it reverses the

Seventh Circuit, Mr. Dionislo would then, I assume, be given an
opportunity to appear again in the district court in which he
could raise the issue that the evidence which the grand jury
sought to compare, had. — and sought to compare his compelled
exemplar, had been unconstitutionally obtained and would
appear to be just cause for —
Q

If this court refuses the Seventh Circuit

will that not reinstate the judgment, the contempt conviction?
MR. CROWLEY:

I think it would, your Honor, but I

think then Mr. Dionislo would have other collateral proceedings
available to him.

26

Q

You mean he could go to the grand jury —

MR. CROWLEY:
to give the exemplars.

Go to the grand jury and again refuse
I think he would have to do that on

other grounds -— on other grounds.
Q

You say that he would give them save for the

unconstitutional obtaining of the evidence?
MR. CROWLEYs

Without binding your Honor again*

without looking into the future as to what 1 would do or what
his counsel at that time would do» I would assume' that a
procedure similar to that would have to be followed in order
to protect ..his record» yes* and to comply with the order of
this court.
Q

Mr. Crowleys are you saying that this issue

that you have been discussing is before the court on the
present record?

It is the position of the respondent here that the
decision of the Seventh- Circuit ,dp.es not. as contended by the
government* present a novel issue.

It has been law since

Hale versus Henkel that the fourth amendment applies to grand
Jury proceedings.

In Hale vsrsus -Henke 1, this court held

or struck a subpoena requiring the production of documentary
evidence before a grand jury as being overbroad in violation
of the fourth amendment.

27
It is also interesting to note that this court’s
decision in Hale versus Henkel., as did the decision of the
Seventh Circuit below, this court indicated in Hale versus
Henkel that it might

very well appear at some future time

in the grand jury proceedings that the request for this
over-broad production of documentary evidence might very well
be a reasonable request and therefore, reasonable within the
meaning of the fourth amendment and that the person then
could be compelled to produce the papers.
What the government would ask this court to hold is
that the fourth amendment9s application to grand -jury
■

/'

proceedings applies solely to the production of documentary
evidence.

We submit that to place this limitation upon the

fourth amendment is to give an unduly restrictive meaning to
the fourth amendment.
What the government , if their position.is sustained,
here, what they would then allow the grand jury to do would
be to do, under the aegis of a simple grand jury subpoena, to
violate the fourth amendment where normal investigative
procedures of law enforcement agenices could not -.-do.
Q

Haven’t the grand jury powers traditionally

oan one of the broadest powers that are possessed by
government?
CROWLEY:

Mr. Chief

Justices they have been

the grand jury in its investigation cannot because it wishes
to investigate* cannot violate the privileges under the
fourth amendment if —
Q

Doesn’t the Davis case turn on the fact that

Davis’ fingerprints were taken when he was in custody
illegally and here is it not a distinction unless you claim
that he is illegally before the grand jury?
MR. CROWLEY;

Mr. Chief Justice* I think it is a

distinction without a difference.
Q

Yes* in Davis —

The Davis case turned on that distinction

so how can you say this is without a difference?
-T*- •••

MR. CROWLEY:

+ ■

•''

'■

Ho* but I think that in this case* if

this court — if we take that analogy then all’that would
have been required in Davis to legalise the grand jury or
the fingerprint ~~ if the situation had been reversed* rather
than the dragnet detention in Davis where the police went up
and took Into custody many* many young blacks in. the
community* what if they did* Instead of doing that* cause
subpoenas* grand jury subpoenas, to be served on every young
black in the community* called him before the grand jury and

29
forced him to give his fingerprints before the grand jury I
submit that the invidious nature would still be present and
that the grand jury would be violating the individual's
fourth amendment rights just as much as the unlawful police
detention in which the fingerprinting was a product of that
unlawful detentions, because it is true that the grand jury
can issue a subpoena to compel the appearance of anyone before
it.

However, the grand jury cannot issue a subpoena to compel

the production of things before it without regard to the
fourth amendment„
And I think by analogy, proposed Rule *il in the now
federal rules of criminal procedure provide that applications
can be mads to magistrates to compel individuals to submit
to identification procedures such as suggested here, such as
voice prints, fingerprints and et cetera.
Howeverj in applying to a magistrate for such an
order the* agency or the government applying to the magistrate
must submit papers to show probable cause and reasonable
grounds before the magistrate will Issue such an order.
Now, grand juries, 1 think, are subject’*, generally,
to the jurisdiction of the district court and to say that the
.

f . < • -v

grand jury that weald have greater subpoena power"than the
district court 1 think is to ignore the function of the
grand jury.

We can compel, for example, the attendance of

witnesses before any district court in the United States by

30
proper service of a subpoena but we could not compel that
person -- compel him to appear before the district court in a
case on trial and I don’t think they could compel him to give
voice identifications handwriting exemplars or whatever other
physical characteristics be required.

I think that — yes9

Mr* Justice Rahnquist?
Q

Mr. Crowleys 1 take it you wouldn’t say that

probable cause is required for either a grand Jury or counsel
in trying a case before a petty jury to follow a particular
line of

inquiry with a witness where all that :1s being

sought is ordinary oral question-answer testimony?
MR. CROWLEY:

No, it is not probable cause, your

Honor, but it must bo questions that are relevant in material
to the inquiry and there must be some showing of relevancy
and materiality to the issues at trial before the court will
allow counsel to question into an area that does not have
immediate appearance of relevance.
Q

How about before a grand jury?

Simply oral

questions and answers without any voice print problem
involved?

......
MR * CROWLEY:

'
I think there, your Honor, we are

seeking solely testimony and absent a fifth amendment I don’t
think we have the same principles we have involved here.
Q

Your argument, then, turns on the difference

between a voice print and ordinary question and answer

31
testimony.
MR. CROWLEY:

I think there Is a substantial

difference,
Q

Is it critical to the case you are making?

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Yes, it is.

Well, assuming that the testimony before the

grand jury is taken down on the tape and then tested, what
would you do then?
MR. CROWLEY:

Then there Is another problem that

may be a violation of the fourth amendment if the grand jury ~~
if it can be established, X think* that we have here that there
was no reasonable grounds to bring this man before the grand
jury and he was only called before the grand jury* not asked
any substantive questions in regard to their investigation*
but merely as a ruse -Q

Do you have a right to challenge the reason a

person is brought before the grand jury?
MR. CROWLEY:

Not eliminate* no. you do not.

Once

a grand jury subpoena calling for the attendance of a person
before the grand jury, which is ail these subpoenas call
for — the government speaks in terras of these subpoenas
were narrowly drawn in calling for —
Q

Well, .1 asked a question that is very simple,

which X would like an
MR. CROWLEY:

answer to.
I*m sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall.

32
Q

If you are subpoenaed before a grand jurys do

you have ary redress other than to appear?
MR * CROWLEY;
Q

I do not believe you do* your Honor,

tod when you appear, they ask you your name

and address and that is taken down on tap© and. examined*

What

is your complaint?
MR. CROWLEY:

Your Honor, I do not believe that we

would be faced here with the voice print type of Identification
because ray understanding of voice print is that this would —
taking your voice down on tape — would not give the necessary
fidelity that would allow comparison to the other -»-»
Q

My assumption was it could be done.

What

would your complaint be?
MR. CROWLEY;

1 think the complaint would be

similar to the complaint here that If the witness'. —

You*d move to strike the

grand

Mm?
MR. CROWLEY;

No, I couldn’t do anything then,

your Honor, but If 1 were subsequently indicted tod this

used against me for the purposes of that, identification rather
than used against me as is common for the purposes of —
Q

Would you move to quash the indictment?

MR, CROWLEY;

I don’t • think I could move to quash

the indictment, your Honor.

I think I could move to suppress

Q

So the only difference between this case and

the hypothetical is that they asked him to go outside and do

What is the other difference?

MR. CROWLEY:

It is not.

he were just tobe called before the grand jury —
Q

Well9 in my case, if he didn't answer the

questionss what would happen to him?
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

in your case?

Yas.

MR. CROWLEY:
I

In this

He could take the fifth amendment and

don’t think there would be a -- I think it would be a

perfectly valid claim of the fifth amendment privilege.
Q

Well, you are adding things.

If he did not

answer the question, he would go to jail.
MR. CROWLEY:

In this case he would, not in your

hypothetical though, your Honor.
Q

That is right.

So I can’t see the difference.

I just don't see the fourth amendment point here.
MR. CROWLEY:

Well, your Honor, I think9 under the

fourth amendment. that the physical identifying characteris­
tics such as in Sohmerbsr versus California recogniseds that
the taking of the blood sample was protected under the
fourth amendment. . If we take Dlonislo and Dionislo and 20
others are compelled to appear before the grand jurys
properly compelled before the grand jury and then compelled
under threat of contempt to furnish blood, we have the
Schmerber case before us.
They could similarly be called under the government1
theory — if the government has prevailed in this case ~
dragnet subpoenas could constantly be used to bring people
before the grand jury to compel them to give blood, to compel
them to give hair samples, to compel them to give semen, to
comple them to give voice prints, handwriting, as the case
in Mara and what you are then authorizing the grand jury to
do is allow the government, through the vehicle of the grand
jury, and in violation of Rule 41 of the federal rules
equivalent procedure, just to bypass the magistrate and not
ask the magistrate for the order because there they must show
probable cause and it Is recognised under the rule that that
probably cause for that type of compulsive testimonial
identification, must

that the compulsion for testimonial

identification must be supported by probable cause but then.

35
to allow the grand jury to turn around and do exactly the
same thing* we submit, is just as much protected by the
fourth amendment as it would be protected in an application
to a magistrate.
He submit that these* for example* the voice
exemplar or the parson's voice* as is his handwriting — which
will be covered* of course* by counsel for the Respondent*
Mara -- are not those types of physical characteristics which
are necessarily exposed to plain view, such as person's
stature or his facial characteristics.

A person can choose

to speak or not to speak and to do that requires a conscious
act of will* something that he possesses within himself and
requires his act of will to expose to the general public*
whereas his facial characteristics are exposed to: the general
public and to everyone concerned without any act of will on
his part unless he were to become a hermit
Q

Mr. Crowley?

MR. CROWLEY;
Q

end that is —

Yes?

What if the grand jury asked a witness

appearing before it to roll up his sleeves so they could see
whether or not he had a t&too on his upper arm?
MR, CROWLEY:

I think that would be the physical

characteristics, just as his face,
0

That would require an act of will.

MR. CROWLEY:

Well, that would be such as the

person putting on a coat to see if the coat fits him* which
has been approved by this court.

But I think, your Honor,

that they go to things such as that — go to a mere physical
characteristics of a person.
Q

For example —

Could they ask him to strip down to his

shorts to see If he had something on his back or chest?
MR, CROWLEY:

This could possibly be done, yes,

Because if a — within reasonable limitations of decency9 I
would suppose3 yea.
Q

Well, I said ,rstrip down to his shorts."

HR. CROWLEY:

Right.

But to

~ I think that if

a man, for example, refused — when I talk about the "act of
will " — if a man refused to exhibit his arms to see if
there were a taboo, his coat or his shirt could be removed
ffom him by someone else.

He could ndfc, by his own acts,

completely hide from anyone else what appeared tatooad on his
arm because others could take his coat off and the tatoo
would then become visible.

But no act of anyone else could

force a man to speak and I think that there is a valid
distinction there.
Yes, Mr, Justice Rahnquist?
Q

Mr. Crowley, perhaps

1 am pursuing into an

area where neither you nor I — at least, certainly, I don't
I.

know very much, but certainly one technique of narcosynthesis
in psychotherapy is administration of pentothal or something

37
like that to get a man to speak where he does not* In fact*
want to and where his unconscious takes over.

If you

rigorously pursue that distinction between will and not* I
am not so sure which side of the thing the speaking comes out
on.
MR. CROWLEY:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I — this is

certainly an area beyond my expertise* but it is my under­
standing Just generally that the speaking there is a speaking
with a release of all inhibitions and to speak what is in the
subconscious* to answer questions the answers to which are •
in the subconscious and that the man* in answering the
questions will not color his answer and theoretically will
speak the truth to the question put* I donft know If those
drugs — I just don’t know if those drugs administered to a
person overcome his entire will so that he speaks against his
will.

I donTt believe they do.

I believe that the answer

may not have the inhibitions given by the conscious mind but —
and b® free of that conscious mind and be dictated solely by
the subconscious but I don81 think that the administration
•of the drugs themselves, a fortiorari, just brings forth a
vocal response and I think that in — if we were to take that
position. If persons were dragnetted — and I. think here the
evidence shows that there is a dragnet similar to that in
Davie, that 20 people were called before the grand jury and
there is absolutely no showing whatsoever as to the

reasonableness of their being called before the grand jury
but I don't think the grand jury has to show that but the
reasonableness of the grand jury asking for their voice
exemplar.
Q

Do you make any point of the fact that the

grand jury had directed the exercise to be carried outside
of the court room?
MR. CROWLEYs

Nos I don51«

No9 I don't* your

Honor *
Q

He had refused while he was in the grand jury

room and the refusal outside was merely a repetition* was it
not?
MR. CROWLEY5

I think the record here Is, as the

Solicitor points out8 would indicate the witness * when he
appeared before the grand jury, refused to testify in the
grand jury.

X mean — not in «— he was never requested to

give the exemplars in front of the grand jury per se, but 1
think that the Solicitor’s interpretation of the record here
is reasonably correct and we did not raise that issue below.
The Seventh Circuit mentioned it in a footnote primarily in
relation to the authority of the grand jury to appoint
agents to hear testimony but that is not raised in the district;
court.

It was not raised in the district court and it was

not raised in the court of appeals by the respondent ,
Dioniaio.

39
Q

Well., you? whole point is that he will talk to

the grand jury*

He will say anything and answer any questions

hut he will not give an exemplar?
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

Mo, no —•

Before the grand jury?
Is that your point?

MR. CROWLEY:
Q

??os your Honor, that is not —*

Well, what is your point?

MR. CROWLEYs
Q

Ho.

That is pure —

Will you please tell me what your point is?

MR. CROWLEY:

The point is this, that the compelling

of a witness before the grand jury —* is the position of this
respondent — to give

..Identifying characteristics which are

normally not exposed to public view — is protected by the
fourth amendment.
Q

The exemplifying characteristic is his

talking,
MR. CROWLEY:
Q

His voice, that is correct.

His voice, which he has been using in the

grand jury.
MR. CROWLEY:

He has been using it in the grand jury

but just —
Q

He has been using it in the grand jury but he

does not allow the grand jury to make an exemplar of it*
MR. CROWLEY:

Just as he

40
Q

Is that your point?

MR. CROWLEY:

Just as he is bringing his finger­

prints into the grand jury also* but without'"having placed the
fingerprints on an ink pad and then transferred them to
another pad for purposes of expert comparison* that no
comparison can be made and the same is true with the voice*
Unless* as 1 understand, the procedure, to obtain voice
exemplars for any comparison to be made in whether — and we
don’t raise the question here of the validity of such
experiments, but for the only way that any comparison can be
made is if one speaks into a specific type of device which
records the vibrations and the tonal effects of the voice and
that they can then be compared to other unknown samples*

The

mere talking before the grand jury would not allow the grand
jury, as I understand the procedure in voice exemplars, to
make a comparison to an unknown sample.
Q

You don’t know.

MR. CROWLEY;

I — I don’t.

It is beyond my

expertise.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Lacovara* you have four minutes.

Thank you, Mr. Crowley.
Bo you have- anything

further?
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, two points, Mr. Chief Justice.

41
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A LACOVARA3 ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, LACOVARA:

First of all, on the question of

what the government *s contentions are In this case, I should
point out that we are not- here pressing the notion that nothing
that a grand jury might demand would be covered by the
fourth amendment.

We do not have a case where the grand jury

was demanding that a person strip down to his shorts or
beyond.

We do not have a grand jury demand for semen, do not

have a grand jury demand that someone bring in a gun from his
home,
We simply have a grand jury demand that a witness
properly before the grand jury make available to the grand
jury those identifying physical characteristics .as to which
there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.
arid in the Mara case, handwriting.

Here, voice

That is as far as we are

going in these cases and I think that is as far as we need to
go.

• '
Q

That can be done in the grand jury room?

MR. LACOVARA:
Q

•

Yes, sir.

Or outside the grand jury room depending on

whether or not the witness wants a lawyer present?
MR, LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

That is the limit of all

we have urged through all the lower courts and. here.
Secondly, on the question of the so-called "dragnet/1

42
while it is not clear that si grand jury has to believe that
every person that it calls before it has relevant evidence —
in fact I think the law is to the contrary ~~ here the record
will show that each of the witnesses who was called and was
asked for an .exemplar was asked to read a different transcript}
a different grand jury exhibit„ .so we don’t have even the
case of 20 different people being asked to read the same
transcript to see which of those 20 might have been the
voice intercepted in giving that transcript.
Also8 related to that is the reference that counsel
for the respondent has mentioned about the subsequent
indictment returned by this grand jury said the subsequent
suppression.

Twenty of the 21 people who were called before

the grand jury — all but Mr. Dioniaio ~~ have been
indicted and that also, I think, undercuts the dragnet
possibility, ' On the Gelbard problem we should point out that
the district judge that suppressed the evidence here did not
rule that there was no probable .cause or that the search, the
interceptions3 were unconstitutional.
'In fact 9 the sufficiency of the indictments has
been upheld.

The evidence the Interceptions have been

suppressed because the district ‘judge believes the justice
department' filed improper Internal procedures in securing
approval for.applying to the court for the interceptions.
That issue is before this court in the Pisoicano case.

It is

No. 71-1^10.

The Second Circuits again speaking through

Judge Friendly* has explicitly upheld the validity of the
procedure that the department followed in applying for these
wiretapo.
The Eighth Circuit has apparently also upheld It.
The issue is pending en banc in the Third and the Fifth
Circuits and I believe has been argued in the Fourth and the
Ninth3 but3 essentially& the presentation here is that the
evidence that was to be used as the basis for the exemplars
has not been suppressed on any constitutional or ’lack of
probable cause grounds, but simply on what the district judge
thought was the improper Internal procedure in applying for

-y

the court orders.
Q
•

In that senses violating the statute?

MR. LACOVARA: In that sense» as the district

courts found, it violates the statute.
Q

Well3 suppose that should ultimately prevail,

what happens to this case?
MR. LACOVARA:

I think counsel5s argument is a very

reasonable one„ that if the district court is ultimately
sustained in suppressing the evidence, the 2315 would preclude
the use by the government of this evidence before the grand

S ury.
