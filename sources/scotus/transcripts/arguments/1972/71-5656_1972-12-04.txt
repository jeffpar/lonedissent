MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-5656, Philpott and Wilkes against Essex
County„
Mr. Bruno, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE CHARLES BRUNO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRUNO;

v

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
This case arises as a result of writ of certiorari
to the New Jersey Supreme Court granted by this Court on
May 15, 1972.

The issue presented is whether a county

welfare board, pursuant to an agreement to reimburse, as
authorised by state law, may attach Social Security benefits,
thereby overriding the immunity of Section 407 of Title 42
of the U. S. Code.
On August 2, 1966, petitioner applied to the Essex
County Welfare Board for financial assistance under the
state program for total disability insurance assistance.

This

program is one of the categorical assistance programs in
which New Jersey participates.

In all there are four:

Old

Age Assistance, AFDC, Aid to the Blind, and APTD, Aid to those
with Permanent and Total Disabilities, which this case
involves.
Unlike the regular Social Security Program, which

is federally administered, the categorical assistance
programs are administered at the state and local level,
pursuant to certain federal standards.

The financing

arrangement of the APD program, which this case involves,
requires New -Jersey to pay 50 percent with the Federal
Government providing the remaining 50 percent.
provided on the basis of need to the recipient.

&PTD is
Social

Security is provided on the basis of earnings and premiums
previously paid into Social Security by the wage earner.
As a condition to receiving APTD, petitioner
executed an agreement in which he pledged "all and every
part of the real or personal property wherever found," and
further agreed to sign to the Welfare Board "all and any
part of their personal property as the Board shall or may
from time to time specify."
Petitioner was then referred by the Essex County
Board to the Social Security Administration to apply for
federal disability insurance.

It is not clear from the

record why it took two years for the first Social Security
check to arrive.

But on August 20, 1968, petitioner received

a check from the Social Security Administration of §1,864.20
as a retroactive award of Social Security benefits.
Q

There are intimations in the record, are there

not, as to why it took two years?
MR. BRUNOs

There is an intimation that they did. noi

5

have a correct address of the recipient»

I do not think the

record is much more explicit than that.
Q

Usually when one wants something of this kind ,

he lets himself he known as to his whereabouts»
HR. BRUNO s

This 'Social Security check represented

payments beginning May, 1966 through July, 1968, or
approximately $7£ monthly.

Petitioner received APTD from

the county frost January, 1967 through approximately June,
1970, or approximately $108 per month.
Subsequent to June, 1970, Mr. Wilkes began
receiving veterans5 benefits of approximately $92 a month.
And the combined veterans* benefits and Social Security
benefits surpassed his level of need, thereby eliminating
him from the APTD program.
Upon receipt of the August Social Security check,
it was deposited in a savings account by one Doris Philpott
in trust for Mr. Wilkes.

On the same day, the funds were

attached by the Essex County Welfare Board.

On an agreed

statement of facts, the matter was heard before the Essex
County Court which held for the petitioner, thereby upholding
the immunity provision that Social Security benefits were
immune from attachment by hostile claimants.
The trial court concluded by saying, “If a relative
or a neighborhood grocer or a charitable institution who
advanced funds or credit for maintenance and support of an

6
individual would be barred from recovery out of federal
funds, why should a welfare board be in a better position?
The mere coincidence that the claimant is a public body
cannot dictate a contrary result.

In the absence of any

exception in the statute demonstrating such an intent, the
will of Congress must be enforced.”
The New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed, based
upon the trial court's reasoning.

The State Supreme Court

reversed based upon its view of the equities.

The court

cited as support for its conclusion Section 404 of the Social
Security Act, which authorized the Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare to seek recovery of overpayments of
Social Security benefits.

As far as can be determined, no

state court of last resort other than this case, has
permitted the attachment of Social Security benefits.
I do not believe, Your Honors, that this is a
difficult case.

The petitioners are basically urging two

contentions. And the first is that the meaning of Section
40? of Title 42 is clear—clear on its face.

And that,

secondly, the Essex County Welfare Board should be treated
no differently than any other hostile claimant.
Q

I gather the statute is so clear on its face

that there is no room for equities.
MR. BRUNOs

It is petitioner's position that the

statute is unambiguous, is clear, is precise, unqualified

7

and absolute in every way and that there were no exceptions
intended wher Congress passed this legislation.,
Q

Therefore , the approach taken by the

Supreme Court balancing the equities is not permissible?
MR. BRUNO:
of the statute.

That is true, under the fair reading

And the immunity provision under 407 provides

this twofold shield.

It protects the recipient prior t©

receipt of those benefits, and if protects the recipient after
lie has received the benefits»
es

So, either way, Congress­

I take it you are not arguing, Mr. Bruno,

that if balancing the equities were permissible, that the
equities are with the recipient, are you?
MR. BRUNO;

I think there are equities on both

sides, Your Honor.
Q

What are on the side of the recipient?

He

has hctd the money twice.
MR. BRUNO;

He has had the money twice.

But that

distinction alone does not make him any different than if he
had received earlier monies from another
Q

That his statutory argument.

MR. BRUNO:
Q

creditor.

Right.

What 2 am suggesting is as a lawyer, any room

for consideration of the equities, he would be hard put to it
to it to find any supporting his claim to keep--to get the
money twice, would he not?

MR, BRUNO;

Yes, sir, except for the fact that his

resources are limited and that the money he does receive
would go for his support and maintenance.

X mean, that would

he the equities on his side,
Q
the

The basic argument, I would suppose, is that

equities are irrelevant,
MR. BRUNO;

That is true-.

That what we have is a

statute that is very clear and absolute on its face, and that
there is no reason to go behind it.
Q

That you cannot go—-not that there is no

reason to go—-but it is impermissible to go behind it? is not
that your argument?
FIR. BRUNO;

Yes, sir.

That to do so would ba a

violation here of—
Q

Plain statutory language.

MR. BRUNO;

Not only of plain statutory language

but also the legislative prerogative in the policy decision.
What does Social Security do if you overpay?

Q

MR. BRUNOs
404 of the act.

They secure a recovery under Section

But in order to secure that recovery, the

action must be instituted

under Section 404 by the

Secretary of HEW and not by the state in question.

There is

no room under 404 for the state to institute an action for
recovery.
Q

Would the Secretary have authority to bring

3

any action here, a third-party beneficiary action on behalf
of the state to prevent this windfall?
MR. BRUNO:
Q

They, would not have to.

Could they?

MR. BRUNO:
the reason that

No, I do not think so, Your Honor, for

404 speaks only to an overpayment of

Social Security benefits, and 1 donBt think that the
contention here is that there was an overpayment.

In fact,

the Social Security benefits were very explicitly computed,
and there was no overage and no excess in this case.
Q

Who is Doris Philpott?

MR. BRUNO:

She is Mr. Wilkes' housekeeper.

Mr. Wilkes is an infirm gentleman, and she helps him.
Q

Is there any controversy in this case as to the

basic applicability of the statute in that, as I understand,
the money was deposited in the account of Doris Philpott and
so on?

Or is there an argument about that?
MR. BRUNO:

No, I think that that argument was

settled at the State Supreme Court level where the Supreme
Court in its opinion said—
Q

No question about the applicability of the

statute.
MR. BRUNO:

Recognised it as being held in trust.

The point is that the money was at all times available for the
maintenance and support of Hr. Wilkes, and that is the crucial

10

issue.
Q

And there is no continuing controversy as to

the facts as to the basic applicability of the terms of the
statute,even though this deposit was made in the account of
Doris Philpofctf or is there?
MR. BRUNO:
courts,

I am inquiring.

There was not in any of the lower

1 am not certain as to what—
Q

It is too late to have one here.

MR. BRUNO:
Q

I would think so.

Mr. Bruno, Mr. Wilkes was hospitalised in a

sanitarium for a time, was he not?
MR. BRUNO:
Q

That—yes, that is—

Was that at any of the time when these payments

v?ere not being made?
MR. BRUNO:
Q

No, sir.

At a different time?

MR. BRUNO:

That was at a much earlier time,

several years previously, and that fact is also outside the
record in this case.
Q

1 just saw it in Justice Hall's opinion in

the. footnotes.

I do not know whether it is outside of the

record or not.

In footnote four he says he had previously

received state disability assistance which was terminated in
1965 because he was a patient in a county sanitarium.
MR. BRUNO:

Yes.

11
Q

Is that outside the record?

MR. BRUNO;

Yes, Your Honor, it was,.

Q

Address that to Justice Hall.

Q

Mr. Bruno, was Mr. Wilkes also receiving any

VA benefits during this period?
MR. BRUNO:

No.

As soon as he began receiving-

veterans6 benefits, he was terminated from APTD
Q

assistance.

One last question. If this case is reversed,

is there any possibility that it opens the door to fraud by
persons making their whereabouts unknown for a convenient
time and then later collecting?
MR. BRUNO:

I do not think frat’d should be a

serious problem in this case because, if it arises, the
county has sufficient resources to prosecute those individuals
that purposely intend to delay this process.

What I do see

happening, though, is that if an exception is created, that it
might have the effect of undermining the security that many
older people and disabled people now enjoy under Social
Security benefits because it would create litigation in both
state and federal courts.
Q

There--

This is security to which he is not entitled.

All that you can say is that he needs the funds but other
people need the same funds that otherwise would not have gore
to him.
MR. BRUNO:

Then we are back to our original

12
position that the Welfare Board in this instance is no
different than any other creditor or hostile claimant.

The

language 407 is even broader than the word "creditor," and
it is more encompassing, more embracing.
„v’ .

Q

I suppose you would argue too, would you not,
%

Mr. Bruno, that it is virtually impossible, given the language
of the statute, to distinguish between someone who may have
acquired too much and someone who has only acquired what
they should have and that to protect the security of those
who simply have what they should have was Congress's intent
in forbidding attachment.
MR. BRUNO:

I think Congress recognized that in the

policy judgment that they made in 1935, that minor
inequities would be created by this provision, and they
recognised that some legitimate claimants might like to
secure repayment for money that they had loaded.

But as

deciding between those claimants and the Social Security
recipient, they came down on the latter in their favor.
I think. Your Honor, that I would like to reserve
the remaining portion of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR, BRUNOs

Very well, Mr. Bruno.

Thank you.

13
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD REICHSTE1N, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR. REICHSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
In the first sentence of the argument in ray brief
we made what I thought was a rather important confession,
that if the statute in question were applied literally,
without consideratior, of the particular factual situation,
we would be barred from recovery.

Such decision, construing

the statute literally, would not be out of conformity with
precedent, would be a safe and sound decision.

The only

criticism the Welfare Board would have would be that such
a decision would not be fair, would not be equitable, and
it would not furnish justice under the particular factual
circumstances of this case.
We contend that the statute cannot be put in a
glass jar and analyzed from afar in a vacuum.
analyzed as it is applied to particular facts.

It has to foa
And we

respectfully submit that the facts in this case are
important and justify the interpretation given to the
statute by the New Jersey Supreme Court.

In particular, the

primary fact that Mr. Wilkes here received a double payment.
If he had furnished his correct address to Social Security
and received his payments, approximately $70 per month, as
they became due, the Welfare Board would have contributed

another $38, 1 believe, to his income.

But, in fact, for

most of the period which the retroactive check covered,
Mr. Wilkes received the full $108 from the Welfare Board.

So

that whan he subsequently received the lump sum check from
Social Security, he in effect did receive double funds for
a substantial portion of the period.
The fact about the lack of address by Social
Security is sat forth in the Appendix, page £28, a letter
from the Social Security Department.
Q

Would you tell us,whether the states have

ever made any effort to have Congress modify the statute
with a specific exception for dual payments to only-—
MR. REICEETEIN:

Ho, sir.

The statute is some 35

to 40 years old new, and so far as we have been able to find
there has been no such indication.

I think perhaps that

the thinking was so clear that it. is not subject to
interpretation»
Q

Has this situation, to your knowledge, reached

trial?
MR. REICHSTEXM?

In New Jersey we have had three

cases since.
Q

Since this one?

MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Yes, sir,

But before that?

MR. REICHSTEINs

There were two cases which we

15
cited in our brief to the Mew Jersey Supreme Court, both
unreported decisions, one in the state courts and one in the
federal courts.
Q

And how did they go?

MR. REICHSTEIN:

Both in our favor, basically on

the theory that there was fraud involved.
Q

Fraud?

MR. REICHSTEIN:
Q

Fraud.

But also there was no—

They presumed or they found actual fraud?

MR. REICHSTEIN:

In one case there was a finding

of fraud? in the other I think it was merely a presumption.
One case was the Essex County Welfare Board v. Hardy, which
is a county court decision in 1966, where the recipient
failed to notify welfare that he received a lump sum payment,
and in that case the court held that lump sum payment was
not exempt from the levy by the Welfare Board.

And the

second case was a federal court decision, district court,
where the Welfare Board reached the proceeds from the
National Service Life Insurance Policy.

Q

I notice that the Solicitor General is

supporting petitioner in this case.
MR. REICHSTEIN:
Q

Perhaps.

We know of no state court of last resort

except this one that has permitted attachments of Social
Security funds.

16

MR. REICHSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

But in his

brief the Solicitor General does apparently concede that a
particular factual situation can arise which would give rise
to an exception to the broad language of Section 207.

He

then reviews the particular facts of this case•and says if is
not justifiable in this particular case.

But I would

respectfully point out that the, fact that the checks were
withheld for newer address was not set forth in the record
furnished at the time the Solicitor General's brief was
filed and that particular fact is not mentioned in the
Solicitor General's brief.
Q

You said that fact is in the record?

MR. REICHSTEINj

The Appendix? not in the record

itself but in the Appendix filed with this Court, page A28.
Q

I mean, was this before the courts below?

MR. REICHSTEIN:
Q

Ho, it was not, sir.

How do we consider it?

MR. REICHSTEIN:

Merely because the question was

considered by the New Jersey Supreme Court in this decision,
and I believe there was some wording in that report to the
effect that, the court did not know why the benefits were
i

withheld such a long time.

I believe it is an?immaterial

question, and the information was furnished by HEW to the
attorneys for the petitioner in this case.

And that is the

reason that we ask that the letter be reproduced in the

17
Appendix.
Q

Do you know whether your opposition is

objecting to its inclusion in the Appendix?
MR. REICHSTEXN;

I have heard no such opposition

to this .point, Your Honor.

Q

Where is it in this Appendix?

MR. REICHSTEXN;
Q

A23?

MR. REICHSTEXN:
Q

In the Appendix.

Page 28, sir.

28?

MR. REICHSTEXNs
Q

Page A28.

Yes.

Then presumably your opposition itself has

placed it in the Appendix.
MR. REICHSTEXN;

No, I cannot say that, Mr. Justice.

I requested it at one point.

The last two sentences of the

letter froia HEW on page 28.
Q

What is the significance of that?

MR. REICHSTEXN;

That the benefits were withheld

only because they did not have a current address for the
petitioner, Mr. Wilkes.
Q
suggest, fraud?

It said pending a new address.

What does that

is that vour argument?

MR. REICHSTEXN;

It could suggest it, sir, but X

am not alleging fraud in this particular case.

I do suggest

that a literal reading of the statute would open the door to

18
a widespread fraudulent situation whereby, as Mr» Justice
Blaekmun indicated, I believe, recipients of Social
Security could withhold Social Security benefits—
Q

I am not suggesting that is not so»

What I

am asking you is. Are you suggesting any fraud in this case
based on that statement-MR. REICHSTEIN;

Yes, sir.

Fraud was alleged in

the initial complaint that was filed.
Q

That is not my question.

Are you suggesting

that this proves fraud in this case?
MR. REICHSTEIN:
Q

Ho, air.

Ho, sir, far from it.

Does the state have any elbow room in a

situation like this by refusing to make the payments?
MR. REICHSTEIN;

No, sir, that is—the distinction

set forth in the so-called involuntary creditor cases, the
Savoid case, the Lewis case, the Sepsick f?} case.

The

argument was made that the neighborhood grocer or the
neighborhood baker is barred by the provisions of the
Social Security Act.

We contend that the Welfare Board here

is in a different situation.

The local baker, butcher or

whatever he may be, is not under any compulsion to furnish
any goods or services to the recipient.

Here the Welfare

Board is mandated by statute to furnish such assistance.

As

such, it is not a voluntary creditor but in the nature of an
involuntary creditor.

And we submit that the language of the

IS
involuntary creditor cases* while not strictly applicable to
this factual situation, does have a bearing.
is applicable.

The reasoning

And for that reason we suggest that the

involuntary creditor cases did offer the New Jersey Supreme
Court a sufficient basis to create an exception in view—
Q
untary.

The statute did not say voluntary or invol­

It said what?—creditor.
MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

As a matter of fact—

Has credit been proved involuntary?

MR. REXCHSTEXN:

X would think it does.

I would

think the interpretation given by the courts in the Savoid
case* in the Lewis case* was very strained* very tortuous.
Therefore* in this case what we are seeking is a head-on
confrontation.

We are asking the Court not to reverse on the

basis of the involuntary creditor cases or the basis of the
cases cited by HEW in its brief to the effect that the
statute was not merely intended to apply to accrued benefits *
past benefits.

X think those interpretations fly in the face

of the statute just as much as the interpretation we are
seeking„
The Court could also* in this particular case* say
that by depositing the monies in the account of a third
person* Miss Philpott* that Mr. Wilkes exceeded the protection
he was allowed by Porter case in that he was no longer* once
the money was put in the account under the name of someone

20

else able to control the funds.

We submit that such an

interpretation would have the effect of allowing us to win
this particular battlef but I think in effect wa would lose
more because in such situation the recipient hereafter would
merely deposit the funds in his own name.
I think the issue lias to be considered in light of
the history of the Social Security Act itself and the fact
that when Social Security was originally enacted and conceived»
the scope of the present-day welfare program was nowhere near
what it is today.

I respectfully submit that the welfare

program must be considered as a complement or a supplement to
the Social Security program.

This is the line of argument

set forth in the brief filed by the state as amicus curiae.
I think it is a valid one? that both programs have to be
considered together.

The funding for both programs

basically comes out of HEW.

The result of considering both

programs together is the only result„ we submit, which can
result in anything approaching a fair or equitable
situation.

For these reasons, we respectfully submit that

this Court affirm the decision of the Hew Jersey Supreme
Court.
Q

Did the United States get its money back?

MR. REICHSTEIN;
Q

The United States would get—

No? could it recover what it paid?

MR. REICHSTEIN:

I do not see how.

I think the

21
United Statas would be barred by the same statute which the
petitioners bars us,
Q
back,-is it?

The United States is not entitled to anything
It paid only the Social Security benefits to

which this man was entitled»
MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Were these for disabled people?

MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Social Security?

Yes.

MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Yes, sir.

Do they pay money to disabled rich people?

MR. REICHSTEIN%
Q

Except—

Yes, sir.

And so they were entitled to the money no

matter what.
MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Yes, sir.

Could the United States have conditioned,

its

payment upon the recipient repaying to the state?
MR. REICHSTEINz

I believe it could have, yes, sir,

if that is considered a problem»
q

Then is there very much trouble in this whole

picture?
MR. REICHSTEIN:

Yes, sir.

I believe that the

statute
0

l mean, if the United States simply asked,

"Have you been receiving disability payments from someone

22
else/* would the whole problem wash out or not?
MR. REICHSTEIN:

No, sir, because whatever the

answer to that question is, the Social Security benefits
would still have to be paid, and the particular disability
benefits would still have to be paid.
Q

Your answer a while ago—perhaps you did .not

mean it—that the United States could have conditioned its
payment upon repayment to the state—•
MR. REICHSTEIN:

By statute they could have done it

yes, sir.
Q

Oh, by statute.

MR. REICHSTEIN:
Q

Yes.

But under the present statute they could not?

MR. REICHSTEIN:

I do not believe so, sir.

No, sir

I am sorry, Mr. Justice Stewart asked me a question
with reference to the applicability of Social Security
benefits and. whether the Government was entitled to any
refund.
Q

In this case I understand that the

Government's payments were not in any way erroneous.

They

came late, but beyond that they were just exactly what this—
MR. REICHSTEIN:

The Government is considered to

be part of the welfare program also; it supplies half the
funds for the welfare program.
Q

Yes, but under this, this man did not receive

23

an. overpayment.
MR. REICHSTEINs
Q

Directly from the United States.

MR. REICHSTEIN£
Q

No, sir»

No, sir.

So, the United States had no ground to bring

up any kind of an action to get any of it back, did it,
directly?
MR. REICHSTEINs

Hot directly, sir, just under the

weIfare program.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Bruno, do you have

anything further?
REUBTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE CHARLES BRUNO, ESQ,. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Q

Do you agree with your colleague there in

terms of what the United States might be able to do and what
it. might not be able to do?

Do you think this particular

statute at issue in this case would bar the United States
from recovering its payment?

I am not suggesting that the

United States could get it back, but if it could not. would it
be because of this statute?
MR. BRUNO :

I cannot conceive of any circumstances

how the United States could get the money back unless there
has been a miscalculation.
Q

But it would not be this statute which barred

the United States?

24

MR. BRUNOs
Q

No

It would be the fact that they were just

carrying cut the statutory program.
MR. BRUNOs
Q

Right.

Because they make payments to disabled people

whether they are needy or not.
MR. BRUNO:
Q

Yes.

And if it were only the needy disabled that

were paid Social Security» there might be a ground for
recovery because somebody who is being paid elsewhere is not
particularly needy.
MR. BRUNO:
Q

Is that right?

MR. BRUNO:
that point.

Right.

I am not sure I am following you on

I would like to address myself» Mr. Justice

Blackman, to your question on the two-year delay.
know why it took two years.
took two years.

I do not

Mr. Wilkes does not know why it

It. did take that long.

The letter from

Mr. Hall at the Social Security Administration was
completely new to the record at the appellate level of the
case.

I am not sure what his thinking is underlying the

two sentences that oppossing counsel refers to.
In any event, the question of the incorrect
address was never part of the record below, and there is no
intimation in this case of fraud.

25
Q
written one».

I take it the letter was not a recently
It is dated back in December, 8 69 and just

was not put into the record*. I suppose.

It is not anything

that was manufactured, I take it.
MR. BRUNOs
Q

You are right.

But still it was not in the record.

MR. BRUNO:

It was not in the record.

There is a point, there that the Welfare Board at
all times knew Mr. Wilkes9 correct address.

So, it was not

a case of him not being available.
Briefly, as to this involuntary / voluntary creditor
concept.

This is an artificial distinction.

There is no

basis from which one could draw a conclusion that Congress
intended a distinction of this sort.

And, furthermore, all

the cases to which my brother opposing counsel refers to
ar© veterans' benefit cases.
1 hasten also to point out that since we are
talking about the equities, that the equities are always on
the side of a creditor, and that it would be impossible to
distinguish between higher and lower equities,

which is

what opposing counsel is asking this Court to do.
Q

There is completely unjust enrichment, is

there not?
MR, BRUNOs

There is always an unjust enrichment

whenever the statute is invoked, because there will always be

26
two payments s the payment that the creditor had extended—
Q

What I had in mind was the difference between

what counsel called the voluntary creditor who takes his
chances and the involuntary creditor who had no options
about it.

At least there are fewer equities available here.

Your position is that the statute does not have anything to
do with equities?
MR. BRUNO5

Yes,, Your Honor.

I wonder also about another situation that poses
an equitable problem, and that is where a municipality
constructs maybe a wafcerpipe in front of a person's home for
the purpose of erecting a fire hydrant and then makes a
special assessment on the people living in the home and that
the* only money that those people have are Social Security
benefits,,

Does the municipality then have a right to attach

the Social Security benefits?
Q

He does not need the Social Security money.

He just puts a lien on the property, that is all.
MR. BRUNO:

I was speaking about the municipality,

in attempting to reach those benefits, to pay for the
special assessment.
Q
goes

If he pxits a pipe exit in front of a house, he

after the house.
I®. BRUNO:

Okay.

The question then boils down

to, Does the statute mean what it says?

And petitioners'

27
is that the statute does mean what it says; it is precise and
it is absolute t unqualified in every way in both its wording
and in the protection that it offers to Social Security
benefits.

Thank yon.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is58 o*clock p.m. the case
was submitted.]
