PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments now

in No, 71-1545» Bute against Glover Livestock Commission.
Mr. Jones, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JOKES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
The issue presented is whether the court below
exceeded the permissible scope of review in setting aside the
Secretary's 20-day suspension of respondent as a registrant
under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.
The suspension was ordered pursuant to the Secretary’s
authority to suspend for a reasonable period any registrant
committing any violation of the Act.
Respondent is a livestock broker or market agency
x$ho is paid a sales commission for conducting an auction at
which livestock is sold on a weight basis.
Respondent has now been detected violating the Act
on four separate occasions by short-weighing cattle consigned
to it for sale.
On the earlier occasions, it had siuply been warned
against future violations.

4
On the fourth instance of short-weighing, which is
the subject of this suit, a formal complaint against respondent
was issued by the Packers and Stockyards Administration.
The case was initially tried before Department of
Agriculture Hearing Examiner who found that respondent had
intentionally short-weighed the cattle consigned to it for
sale.
The hearing examiner recommended an appropriate
cease and desist order, and also a 30-day suspension.
The matter was then reviewed by a judicial officer
having authority to act on behalf of the Secretary.

He-found

that respondent’s short-weighing constituted a willful viola­
tion of the Act, and he issued the cease and desist order
recommended by the hearing examiner, but he reduced respondent’s
suspension to only 20 days.
Since the respondent operates its market only one
day per week, this 20-day suspension will affect, at most,
three business days.
Before discussing the disposition of this case on
appeal, I think it would be helpful to describe the respondent’s
brokerage function as a market agency, and to explain why a
market agency like the respondent might intentionally shortweigh the cattle consigned to it for sale.
The sellers at respondent's auctions are typically
livestock producers who bring, or send, their cattle to the

5
respondent for purposes of the auction.
These livestock producers rarely know the true
weight of their cattle.

They typically lack the weighing

facilities necessary to determine the true weight.
It is the respondent who is responsible for
weighing the cattle.
The buyers at the auction frequently, perhaps
usually, are representatives of meatpacking companies.

They

buy the cattle at the weight given by the respondent, and the
cattle are then shipped to the packing plants where they are
reweighed.
The sad truth of the matter is that the packers
tend to patronise the auctions held by market agencies which
give them a favorable break on the weight, thus, short­
weighing encourages buyers.
And this, in turn, stimulates an increase in sales,
for the livestock producers will tend to patronize the
markets which attract sufficient buyers to insure a sale of
their cattle.
And, since the market agencies are paid on a per
head basis, they profit from this higher level of sales.
Q

Their commission isn't based on a percentage of the

sale price?
MEI. JOHES:

It is based -- and I think that in the

record there is a schedule of the commissions

it is based,

6
in part, on the weight of the cattle.
if the cattle in question weighs 400 pounds or more,
i think the sales commission is $4 and some odd cents.

If it

is between 300 and 399 pounds, it is a lower figure, and so
forth.
Q

To that extent then, it would be against their

interest to short“weigh.
1®. JONES:

Only if the short-weighing brought the

weight down from 100 weight category into a lower one
And, in fact, in this case, none of the cattle
short-weighed, in fact, brought the weight down from 100
weight category to another.

So that there was no loss in

commissions resulting from the short-weighing.
Now, the Packers and Stockyards Act was, of course,
designed to eliminate abuses such as short-weighing.

It does

this by requiring the market agencies to observe a high
fiduciary standard of care in dealing with both buyers and
sellers.
And, since negligent as well as intentional short­
weighing injures the livestock producers, negligent short­
weighing has long been considered to be a violation of the Act.
Weil, I turn now to the treatment of this case in
the Court of Appeals.
Q

Is there any concession here by Glover, however,

that the short-weighing was not due to negligence in this case?

7
MR, JOKES:

No.

I believe that they have con­

sistently maintained that their infractions of the Act were
not intentional.
On appeal» the Court of Appeals -Q

Denied that they were willful?

Or do you dis­

tinguish between intentional and willful?
MR* JONES:

Yes, we do distinguish between

intentional and willful, as did the Court of Appeals.
The Act is phrased in terms of willfulness and
negligent violations are considered willful for purposes -~
Q

It just means you know what you are doing.
MR, JONES:

Q

That’s right.

I mean you know what physical acts you are going

through,
MR, JONES:

I believe that it means that if you act

in careless disregard of your statutory responsibilities that’s
considered to be willfulness for purposes of the Act.
It simply means that you knot» what your responsibili­
ties are and you don't live up to them.
Q

And what is intentional?
MR. JONES:

Well, X suppose that in this context

intentional would mean that, for example, the respondent
ordered its weigh master to weigh the cattle at le3s than their
true weight,
Q

And, there is no concession of their being intentional?

8
MR. JONES:
Q

That's correct.

Is there a concession that they were willful?
MR, JONES:

1 believe so in the sense that the

respondent has conceded that the suspension here was within
the statutory authority of the Secretary.

And, of course,

it would not be if the act were not: committed willfully,

in other words, was not a violation of the Act.
Furthermore, the Court of Appeals upheld the
finding of a violation as supported by substantial evidence
and the respondent has not cross-petitioned in this case, so
that the finding of a violation of the Act is not at issue
here.
However, although the Court of Appeals sustained the
cease and desist order —
Q

Did we limit the grant here only to the remedy?

Is this a limited grant of the writ, do you recall?
MR. JOKES:

I don't recall, Mr. Chief Justice.

The only issue presented, of course, is whether
the suspension itself — excuse me, whether the court exceeded
its permissible scope of review —
Q

There really is only one issue in the case.
MR. JOKES:

And that's the proper scope of review

and how it was applied.
The court did set aside the 20-day suspension here.
It is hard to determine just why the suspension was

9
set aside, however*
The court expressly held that the suspension was
within the Secretary's statutory authority, and it further
acknowledged that the shaping of remedies is peculiarly within
the special competence of the Secretary.
Having acknowledged its narrow powers of review,
however, the court turned to a comparison of this case with
four previous administrative decisions involving suspensions
for short-weighing.
In each of those four cases, at least in the court's
view, the short-weighing had been intentional and flagrant.
The court did not view the respondent’s offense as
being equally culpable. And on the ba3is of this comparison
alone, the court concluded that the 20-day suspension here
failed to achieve uniformity of sactions for similar violations *
In so concluding, the court overlooked the fact
that in those four cases with which it was comparing the
present case, the suspensions there had all been for 39 days,
longer than the period of suspension here.
And the court further overlooked the fact that the
Secretary has frequently imposed suspensions in cases in­
volving offenses no more culpable than those committed by the
respondent.
The court then made its own independent ©valuation of
the proper sanction

to be imposed and concluded that the cease

10
and desist order, when coupled with the adverse publicity which
had attended the finding of the violation, would be an
adequate remedy.
It is our position that the Court of Appeals merely
paid lip service to the applicability of a narrow standard of
review, and that it, in fact, substituted its own judgment
for that of the Secretary with respect to the proper sanction
to be employed for short»weighing under the Act.
I will first outline our view of what constitutes
the proper standard of review in cases such as this, and then
turn to a discussion of how that standard should be applied
to the facts of this case.
This court has repeatedly stressed that the courts
exercise only a very limited power of review over orders
fashioned by administrative agencies.
This limited power of review has normally been
described as requiring the courts to sustain an administrative
action which is authorized by statute and which is not arbitrary, capricious or an abusive discretion,
Although in articulating the proper standards to be
applied, the court has varied its language slightly from case
to case, the essential point has remained clear.

A reviewing

court may not simply substitute its discretion for that of the
administrator.
When discretionary enforcement powers are given by

Ii
Congress to an administrator who thereupon develops special
expertise over the subject matter, a reviewing court may not
replace its discretion — may not replace the administrator's
discretion with its own.
We believe that a narrow scope of review is particu­
larly appropriate where, the administrative action question is
the imposition of sanctions for statutory violations.
The determination of what sanction is necessary to
insure compliance with the act and to deter future violations
must be based upon an informed judgment which can properly
be made only by the administrator who, unlike the reviewing
court, is thoroughly familiar with both the conditions in the
industry and the real significance of the particular violation >
Where the sanction ghoeen

by

the "administrator can be

shown to have some reasonable relationship to his legitimate
enforcement objectives, under the statute, we contend that the
sanction must be sustained,
We believe that a party attaching a sanction bears
a very heavy burden of proof.

That party must show that the

sanction bears no relationship whatsoever to the effectuation
of the statutory program, and is out of all proportion to the
seriousness of the offense.
And when, as in this case, the sanction employed is
a suspension, we believe that that sanction may be modified or
set aside only when the period of suspension Is wholly lacking

12
in reasonableness.
Q

Judge Stevens,in his opinion for the Court of

Appeals, said this was unconscionable»
If, instead of using the word "unconscionable,” he
had said arbitrary and capricious, would that have satisfied
the test?
MR. JONES:
Q

Well, I think that there must »**

Isn’t it, therefore, just a matter of language?
MR. JONES:

I think there must be some reasoned

elaboration.
Q

Well, he gave the reason why he thought it was

unconscionable.
MR. JONES:

Yes, and I will turn to a discussion of

those reasons in a moment.
First, I would say, however, that I believe that the
use of the word "unconscionable" here was not a finding of an
abuse of discretion, but really only a conclusory assertion -a conclusory description based upon the presumed lack of
uniformity of sanctions.
As such, it did not constitute a finding that there
was no reasonable relationship between the sanction imposed
and the need to effectuate the statutory program.
Q

What if he simply said that the Department abused its

discretion?

That would be equally conclusory, wouldn't it?

MR. JONES:

That’s correct and I believe that a

13
reviev?ing court: cannot simply say that this is an abuse of
discretion without explaining why*
And I think that the explanations in this case were
inadequate.
The violation committed -Q

The standard they use is all right here?
I®, JOKES:

Q

Oh, no -«

Only their —
IE.» JOKES:

1 think the court gave lip service

to a narrow standard of review but that it did not attempt
conscientiously to apply that standard.
The violation committed by the respondent here, the
short-weighing of cattle consigned to it for sale, is a serious
offense under the Act, and furthermore, this was not the
respondent’s first violation.

It has been detected short-

weighing on a total of four separate occasions.
These repeated violations may, as the respondent
seems to contend, have been merely cue to negligence, careless-*
ness.
If so, the respondent has repeatedly been careless
in the observance of its statutory responsibilities.
On the other hand, the violations may have been
intentional.
The record is unclear and the Secretary’s findings
are couched only in terms of willfulness, which is the statutory

14

s fcandard.
Whether Intentional or careless, respondent’s
actions thwarted a fundamental safeguard devised by Congress
for the protection of livestock producers.
In contrast to the seriousness of the offense, the
20-day suspension here is relatively mild,
Xt certainly cannot be said, in the context of
respondent’s repeated violations, that this brief suspension
is arbitrary or Jacking in reasonableness or an abuse of
discretion.
Congress has given the Secretary wide discretion
to choose the sanctions necessary to insure compliance with the
Act, and the Secretary, in this case, acted well within his
discretion.
The court below, however, was concerned with whether
there had been uniformity of sanctions for similar violations.
I would note, first, that we believe the court was in
error in concluding that there was a lack of uniformity here.
The Department of Agriculture has provided us and
opposing counsel with a comprehensive list of short-weighing
cases, including 152 cases involving suspensions.
How, these suspensions range in length from a minimum
of one week to a maximum of five years,
How, ’some of the violations were more obviously
Intentional than those involved here, but many were not.

So

15
that, if the history of the enforcement of the Act is any
guide, the sanctions here were, if anything, lenient, certainly
not severe.
But, more importantly, we would submit that the
court fundamentally erred inquire, at least in any strict and
comprehensive way, into the uniformity of sanctions at all.
The Secretary is not required to impose the same
sanction for all similar violations.
In Federal CommunicatIona Commission v. WO&Q, which
we cite in our brief, the court was once before confronted
with the argument that an administrator had not applied
similarly harsh sanctions to violators in the past.
In holding that this factor was not a ground for
rejecting the sanction, the court replied, and I quote

from

page 228 of that volume, "tfe cannot say that the Commission
is bound to deal with all cases at all times as it dealt with
some that seem comparable*"

end of quote.

We believe that the same answer is appropriate here.
Even if it is assumed that respondent's suspension
was harsher than those meted out in the past, the Secretary's
action, we believe, should be measured not against any past
leniency, but only against the need to effectuate the statutory
program.
So, Jr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe that is the
answer to your inquiry about whether merely the verbalisation

16

of an abuse of discretion would be adequate.
We believe it is necessary to show that there is no
reasonable relationship between the sanction and the need to
effectuate the statutory program.
The conclusion of the court's opinion, below,
illustrates that the court was actually substituting its own
judgment for that of the Secretary and not really finding an
abusive discretion.
The court expressed its view that the cease and
desist order, plus routine press iroleases describing the
finding of the violation, quote, "Would certainly seem
appropriate and reasonable with respect to the practice the
Department seeks to eliminate," end quote.
This statement by the court reveals at least two
serious errors.
First, it is for the Secretary and not the court to
determine what constitutes an appropriate and reasonable
sanction for purposes of carrying out the Secretary's enforce­
ment obligations.
Secondly, Congress has made the legislative judgment
that a suspension is appropriate and reasonable for any
violation of the Act, an a fortiori for the serious violation
of short-weighing involved here.
q

it seems to me in your brief, Mr* Jones, you emphasise

that there had been prior violations and that there had been

17
three or four occasions when the authorities of the
Secretary's staff warned Glover about violations*
E4R» JOKES:

That's correct, Mr, Chief Justice,

There were repeated violations,
Q

I don't find that the Court of Appeals made any

mention of that, or perhaps —
MR, JOKES:

I think the court overlooked that, as

it did, I think, many other things, as well, relating to the
seriousness of this offense and to the uniformity of the
sanctions which the Secretary has applied in the past.
In conclusion, we submit that the decision setting
aside the suspension, ordered by the Secretary, should be
reversed and the suspension reinstated.
Q

The upshot was that no punishment or no remedy

whatsoever was to be imposed?
MR. JOKES:

Ko.

A cease and desist order was

sustained by the court below.
Q

But that’s all?
MR. JOKES:

That’s all.

I would like to reserve my remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Eilbott.

Very well.

IS
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R, A* EXLBOTT, JR*, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. EXLBOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Tour Honors, gentlemen of the Court:
I think we came here

or I thought 1 did -- to

argue some degree of law.
But there have been so many statements of fact given
which X do not agree with, and which can only be thought of
as prejudicial to my clients that X think X should answer just
a few of those before I go into what X had intended to say
to this Court.
How, number one, we have this statement by Mr. Jones.
And may X say to Your Honors before X go further that X am a
small country town lawyer and Mr. Jones has been most coopera­
tive to us and most kind to us in the preparation of our
appearance this morning before Your Honors.
I have never had that privilege before except when
X was admitted.
Q

I used to litigate against small town lawyers, too,

and X almost always got beat.
(laughter)
MR. EXLBOTT:
Q

That’s exactly what I thought, sir.
MR* EXLBOTT:

if I can

That’s what X hope to do today.

That's exactly what X intend to do

19
Q

A small town lawyer, counsel, is like the lawyer

who walks into the courtroom with just one law book and that’s
the fellow that ~~
Ml. EILBOTT:

I wish I had one law book, Your Honor.

(laughter)
He first makes mention, however, that we bad been
told four times.
How, if it please Your Honors, let me get one thing
straight,because I have now lived with this case for three and
a half years.
We did receive three letters on the question of
weighing and the record shows that in each and every instance
we immediately had weigh scale testers in to determine what
the condition was of our scales.
And, unfortunately, we got no answers on those
first three occasions.
We would urge Your Honors that in — and the
transcript so shows -- that this was found to be true, that
if you weighed these scales as was required by the Government,
that is, put a weight on each corner and weighed it, they
found nothing wrong with our scales.
And, indeed, nothing was found wrong with these
scales until, at my repeated urging, they brought in a
gentleman from Memphis who had been selling scales and had
been using scales, Fairbanks Morse scales for 20*»some odd years.

20

He testified and it is part of the record.
He showed that those scales had enough wear and tear
that when a cattle rushed onto the scales, notwithstanding
the scales would prove correct at a dead weight, but when you
prodded one on with an electric prod,which is the system, when
it hit the middle of that scale, there was going to be some
variance sometimes*
How, sometimes, the scales would weigh accurately.
Other times, they would not*
Q

Did he testify that it was true of scales all over

the country?
MR. EILBOTT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

He

certainly did, Justice Marshall.
How, when we come down to the question here of how
many -(Whereupon, at 12:00 ©‘clock, noon, the oral
argument was recessed to reconvene at 1:00 o‘clock, p.m*,
the same day.)

21
AFTERMPON SESSION
(1:00 p.ra.)
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel, you

may resume,
MR. EILBGTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Truthfully, gentlemen, when we get through sparring
/■•..•/ii,**'

and there are several things that I would like to answer from
the Solicitor General, we are here on the matter of a 20-day
suspension.
We could have, if it please Your Honors, and the
court record will show, we could have taken the 30-day sus­
pension the day they filed the complaint, or,in plain language,
we could have taken our medicine for 30 days and that would
have been all there would have been to it.

It could all have

been over.
Q

How many business days would that actually he?
MR. EILBOTT:

working days.

Your Honor, that’s about three

The Government is correct on that, but they have

no more conception of what those three working days are to us
than anything in this world.
What those three working days amount to, I think
Mr. Justice Leigh, in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals,
very aptly put it, they amount to calling us crooks.
we are not crooks.

And

22

And that3 s what we stand before this Court on today.
We did not intentionally violate any regulation.
We did not intentionally, if it please Your Honor,
deliberately under-weigh or over-weigh cattle.
In the first place, the Government says that we
were warned four times, and each of those instances »** three
times

-- and in each of those instances, we had the Govern­

ment's own weighing team to check our scales, and they
couldn't report anything wrong to us, because there they use
the four edges of balance.
That's what the record show3.
It was only when we tore those scales down that we
found out what was wrong with the scales, or what could have
been wrong with the scales.
Now, the Government says that was not mentioned by
the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, but indeed, if it please
Your Honors, it was mentioned not once, but twice, in their
opinion.
And if Your Honors look at the Appendix, it is on
page 16 and 19, that the Eighth Circuit -Q
gestion.

It wasn't the Solicitor General.

It was my sug­

X said I couldn’t find it —
MR. EILBOTT:

If Your Honor will look at Appendix A

to the Petition for Writ of Certiorari, on page 16, you will
find, "Glover is an operator of a posted stockyard in Pine Bluff,

23

Arkansas, registered" and so forth, f£o sell livestock*"
"On or about June 2, 1964, July 26, 1966, and June
20, 1967, representatives of the USDA conducted investigations
of," so forth and so on.

And it goes on.

Then, on page 19, it also points out in another
place that these matters were brought to the attention of
the Eighth Circuit Circuit Court of Appeals, and they men­
tioned them in their finding and in their decree.
He would respectfully point out also that in three
of those instances there was no evidence taken, nothing other
than to say, you are not weighing properly, and we called in
a scale examiner, one approved by the Federal Government, and
they could give uo no answers.
The Agriculture Department made no effort to give
us any answers.
So, consequently, when it came to the Eighth Circuit
Court of Appeals, we had had a situation where the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals found specifically that it was not
an intentional and flagrant violation.
And that, also, is in the Eighth Circuit Court
of Appeals opinion, if it please Your Honor.

It is on page 9

of our brief, and I am sure it is in the Appendix.

I didn’t

go to that trouble to find it out.
But, most assuredly, they found no intentional
violation.

24
But we have had a situation that 1 would like to bring
to the attention of this Court.
The word '’unconscionable1’ has come in'.

And, Mr. Jones

states that really the Eighth Circuit didn’t give any reason
for that word.
But, gentlemen, they did.

They most assuredly did.

In the last paragraph of their opinion, they pointed out
exactly why they thought it was unconscionable,
I don't think there is any doubt about it.
They found out that these press releases which
Mr, Jones a few moments ago says -- I've forgotten what he
called them — routine press releases, I believe.
Well, we are in the unenviable position that we
found out we had been charged with an offense in the newspaper.
Everything that was done in this case was in the
newspaper.

Routine press releases?

damaged us.

If they be routine, they

.

They damaged us to the point that truthfully and
honestly if it wasn't at my own insistence we wouldn't be here
today because we are not financially able to be here.
But we are here.
intentionally do anything.
and we are not crooks.

We are still saying we didn't
We didn't intentionally do it,

That's what it amounts to.

How, they say we short-weighed cattle.
There were 29 drafts, I believe it was, proven to

25
have been weighed.
Whether or not those cattle had any excess water,
which would have caused them to gain weight, I am not in a
position to say, but if it please you Justices, neither was
the Government because they weren't there either.
I know one thing.

Of the 29 drafts weighed, 9

were under-weighed, 9 were over-weighed and the rest were
right on the spot.
And 1 want to say to you that of the 9 under-weighed,
2 of them — 2 out of the 9 — belong to one of my clients
who was selling his own cattle through the Livestock Commission
Agency.
In other words, if anybody got cheated on those two,
it was Thomas Glover who owns part of Glover Livestock
Commission Agency.
How, that doesn't make sense to me, that we would
intentionally cheat ourselves.
How, the Government has used the argument that I
have heard since the first day we heard this before a
hearing examiner.
And, let me digress just one minute and say that
the way we heard this matter is simply this.

The Government,

through the Agriculture Department, charges us with an offense.
That's heard before a hearing examiner who is an employee of
the Agriculture Department.

That's heard with two witnesses

26
from the Agriculture Department.
That’s heard with prosecutors, two of them, from the
Agriculture Department.
And from that, we had an appeal to a judicial review
officer who also is an employee of the Agriculture Department.
And that was what we got in the way of a hearing
until we got to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
And X would be the first to admit that they do have
somewhat limited powers of review, but Congress never intended
that the Judiciary abdicate all of its powers to the regulatory
commissions.
Certainly, if it did, it should have said so.
We have been told here that the reason that we did
this, the reason we short-x^eighed x$as because if we shortweighed them when we weighed the cattle, then the buyer got
more than he paid for and he was happy.
I’ve heard that now for three and a half years, but
that isn’t the truth either.
And, I don’t mean to imply that anyone is fibbing.
I mean to say that’s a matter of philosophy.
The truth about the matter is, in the conduct of
livestock commission agents,whoever1s got the cattle to sell,
the buyers will come.

You don’t need to worry about getting

buyers if you can get the farmer to bring you the cattle.
He don't have to under-weigh the farmers' cattle and

27
give Armour a little excess 10 or 15 pounds.
Q

You are «*- at least as I follow your argument -«•

you are arguing,rearguing,an element on which the Court of
Appeals has found against you, and you have no cross appeal
here.
For example, at page 19 -MR. EILBOTT:
Q

Mister —

Let me read this, first.
’’All evidence considered, the hearing examiner,

crediting the evidence that the cattle reweighed had no
access to food and water, could properly conclude that they
had been underweighed by Glover.”
And that’s just one of several items.
The only thing the case is here on — at least so
I had thought -** was the appropriateness of the Court of
Appeals modifying the penalty, not the fact findings.
MR. EILBOTT:

Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice, and that

was what I was prepared to argue until I came this morning and
I found that it was stated that the Court of Appeals had not
considered this, that and the other, and I knew the Court of
Appeals had because it was in their opinion.
I will gladly move along into

what we are really

here for.
The appellee here concedes that the judicial review
by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, whether it be good law

28
or bad law, is a limited review.
But, we say to you, in all sincerity, that there has '
been absolutely no proof, and the Eighth Circuit Court of
Appeals so found, that there was any intentional violation of
the statute, or the regulations.
As a matter of fact, there is none.
We have asked the Department of Agriculture.

We

have requested of the Solicitor General that they show us one
case in which the Department, without a finding of intentional,
can say that a suspension is in order.
We didn't place into the law the requirement that
these orders be uniform.
Indeed, this Court did not place that into the
law.

The Secretary of Agriculture, himself, said that
the findings of the Department of Agriculture should be uniform,
because otherwise they would be discriminatory.
And that is in the much cited case of Roycejv. d/b/a
Madison Stockyards, which is a Department of Agriculture case.
We are here saying merely one thing,

The Department

of Agriculture may have found that there was a proper reason
for suspension of our license for 20 days, but if they did,
they didn't set it out in their opinion and neither did the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Yet, as the Eighth Circuit said, and as the Department

29

of Agricultura has said, these rulings must be uniform.
Hr. Jones mentioned 150 cases, but those «ere not
cases.

That «as a mere citation at the bottom of a page,

that merely mentioned rulings of the Department, whether they
were consent cases, those in which a person had consented to
be suspended, which most of these cases end up being, or
whether they were actually tried, or whether they were entered
on an original order,
Q

What difference would it make, T. wonder, whether

they were tried, actually tried out on a contested basis, or
whether they, in effect, entered a guilty plea, in terms of
the penalty?
HR, EILBOTT:

Your Honor, we find no case, and we

have asked the Department to show us a case,in which it has
been tried or otherwise, where they have made a finding that
or have not made a finding that it was intentional and
suspended a business.
Ebt a one.
And I say to you today, standing in the Supreme
Court of the United States, we have not found a single case,
absence the finding of intentional violation,that a suspension
order has been issued by the Secretary of Agriculture up to
the day he issued our order.

Why did the Court of Appeals send it back for a

MR. EXLBOTT:
Q

I beg your pardon?

Could the Court of Appeals have sent It back for

a finding?
I®. EXLBOTT:

I don’t think there was evidence there.

Justice Marshall, to support such a finding*
Q

I said, well, could they have sent it back to the

administrative agency to make a further finding one way or
the other?
MR, EXLBOTT:
they could, yes.
Q

Yes, sir.

And if they did, X think

And if they did —

But, instead, they took over the administrative

agency’s job,
MR. EXLBOTT:

They may have taken it over only

because —
Q

Well, if they took over the administrative agency’s

job, do they have authority to do that?
MR. EXLBOTT:

X think they do.

Unless you would read

the Stockyard and Packers Act as a complete abdication of
.judicial review.
Q

I am just talking about general administrative law —
MR. EXLBOTT:

Q

What in the Act makes it so different?
MR. EXLBOTT:

Q

I understand that,

What makes it so different from the

The regular Administrative Procedure Act?
MR, EXLBOTT:

I think the Eighth Circuit could have

**»

31
sent It back, but they chose to say —
Q

Well, would you object to us suggesting that the

Eighth Circuit send it back?
MR, E1LBQTT:

That would be just like throwing us

back to the lions from which we came,

Somewhere along this

line, surely we have a right to be heard by judiciary.
We went through all of the departments —
Q

I am asking you about what relief you are entitled

to?
MR. EILBOTT:
Q

I am entitled to a relief --

You want this Court to say that you are just not

guilty of doing anything.
MR. EILBOTT:

Wo, sir.

If it please, Your Honor,

Mr, Justice Marshall, there is plenty that has already been
done.
Number one, we have been dragged through the mud
and mire,
Number two, there is a cease and desist order that
we do not appeal from.
If we violate that cease and desist order, I am sure
Your Honor knows that the penalties are rather severe.
What we are fighting and all we are fighting is
what the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals said was unconscionable.
And that’s the 30-day suspension.
There's plenty of teeth in what they’ve done to us,

32
besides the 30-day suspension.
They didn’t need that to add to our

woes.

That is our point.
Because with the finding of that 30-day suspension,
on the basis of the cases before us, they have found that no
intentionally violated the Act.
And we’ll deny that until the day we die.
Those are our sentiments,
Q

You are saying that it is inconsistent and in

violation of

what is it, the Secretary’s own rules **- if

he, for the first time, imposes a suspension that is not an
intentional violation?
MR. EILBOTT:
reason.
Q

That’s correct, without giving a

And he gave no reason here.
Well, he imposed a penalty though.
MR. EjlLBOTT:

Yes, sir.

And his own judicial review officer reduced it 10
days,
Q

But you are saying that because this is the first

time it is inconsistent?
MR, EILBOTT:

Then it is discrimination, unless

he gives a reason why we should be discriminated against.
Q

So any two instances where you have non-intentional,

non-intentional violations, you must either give them both

MR, EILBOTT:

Q

MR. EILBOTT:

He may have changed his mind, then

he should have given us a reason why we, of all the world,

The record will show in this case that of the 50
stockyards in the State of Arkansas, only one was examined
in twelve months, and that was us,
Mow is there reason for that, too?

I am not even sure that is part of the record.

I can quote it to you

Q

But not with respect to the remedy phase?
MR. EILBOTTf

Mo, but I can say to you I asked

Mr. Grizaell, one of the two Government witnesses, whether or
not he had any proof whatsoever that we intentionally
violated this Act, and he said no.

34
Q

What clo you understand willful means under this

Act?
MR. EILBOTT:

What 1 understand willful means, could

be flagrant negligence, but that’s far different from in­
tentional.
Q

Oh, yes, but is that all it means?
MR, EILBOTT:

Willful means --

Yes, sir.

It does not mean that we intentionally back-weighed.
O

You didn’t know you were short-weighing.

You knew

what physical acts you were going through and you were careless.
That’s the most it means, huh?
MR. EILBOTT;

We were careless, but we also, when

we were careless, we took every step we knew to find out what
was wrong.

We had the Government's own scale weighers to weigh

the scales, to check them.
Q

But it was, nevertheless, the finding is that you

were careless,
MR. EILBOTT:

The Eighth Circuit found we were

careless, but the Eighth Circuit refused to find that we
intentionally did what we did.

And the Eighth Circuit pointed

out that the Secretary had held that uniformity was -<r '

MR. EILBOTT:
Q

Well —

Unless —

35
MR. EILBOTT:
Q

According to his own opinions.

He has to put hits with the negligent violator rather

than with the intentional?
MR. EILBOTT:

Yen, sir.

But if he puts him only with the negligent violator
then it is my position that the Department of Agriculture or
the Secretary must show a reason for doing that.
Otherwise, all others who have been found guilty
only of negligence ~~ there has been nothing but a cease and
desist order.
Why suddenly us?
Q

Well, on that score ~~
MR. EILBOTT:

Q

May I finish?

Go ahead, you finish.
MR, EILBOTT:

If he was going to make the new rule,

then why didn't he say so?
Q

Well, right on that point, it is a common occurrence

in traffic courts, for example, that a traffic judge con~
fronted with hundreds and hundreds of cases sees a mounting
epidemic, almost, of either drunken driving or speeding, or
some such thing,
Finally, the last straw comes.

And on that day he

starts imposing more severe sentences to make an example of
them, either a drunk driver or a speeder, or what not,
Wow, do you think the judge, that's what you have

36
here, must make some explanation that this situation is getting
so severe that X am tired of this under-weighing and we are
going to make an example out of Glover?
Do you think he has to articulate that?
MR. EILBOTT:

You are getting down on my level now,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I know that the judge xjould lean back in his chair
and say,5feh% Eilbott, I am tired of this.

I am tired of this

continuing mounting of this type of offense and that typo of
offense and I am going to put a stop to it.”
Q

Let’s assume he didn’t, though.

That’s the

assumption.
Let’s assume he —

Q

Well, they do it quite regularly,
MR, EILBOTT:

Then assuming he did.

If it was

within his power, he had that right, but it would certainly be
discriminatory against the first man he did it to.
Q

The first man, but not the second?
MR. EILBOTT:

Q

Sir?

The first one, but not the second.
MR. EILBOTT:

No, if he had announced a caveat

But not the second or the third,
MU, E1LB0TT:

If he had announced a caveat, then

I would say it was not discrimination.
But: I say, in,all fairness, that when you, out of
a great line of cases, none of which has ever imposed a
suspension unless there be found an intentional violation,
then suddenly you do that, you are saying to me and to my
clients, you are a bunch of crooks.

Q

The question in the case is whether Congress gave

them that power, really, isn’t it?
MR, EILBOTT:

Yes, that is, but the question is also

in this case that the Secretary set out the original rule
that the findings must be uniform.
And, if he is going to depart from those findings,
then he should say, "Now, gentlemen, this is where we get off.
This is the first case, but we are going to depart from our
rule for these reasons."1
They shouldn’t just single one out without any
warning whatsoever and say, "You little bitty outfit down there
in Arkansas, now, we’ve had packers, we’ve had stockyards,
we’ve had —by the thousands.

Well, would it be fair to assume that since you

indicate there were news releases and the word has gotten
around in the industry, among the dealers -- would it be fair
to assume that perhaps they are being a little more careful
after the experience with Glover and the litigation that’s
ensued ?
MR. EILBOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I do not propose

to deal in levity with you, but it would have been easier if

39

Then, maybe, it

might have been a better lesson»

I don't think it has had any effect

That's the only one

that's ever been inspected, as far as I know, in the State of
Arkansas,

It certainly was up until the day we were inspected.
I think there is a little more here than is in the

record, if you want to know what I think, but I have no proof
of that, Your Honor.
Thank you for your kindness.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr.Eilbott.

Mr. Jones, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
Ml. JONES:

I would just like to dispel one mis-

itapression.
The counsel for the respondent has asserted
repeatedly that the Secretary has not imposed suspension in
cases where there was no finding of intentional misconduct.
However, I would like to bring to the Court's
attention the IS cases which we cite in our Footnote 7, page
20, of our merits brief, where there were suspensions **»
Q

Give us a little time to find that, will you,

40
Mr. Jones.
What page again?
MR. JONES:

Page 20 of our brief, Footnote 7.

And in these cases, there vias a suspension issued
for short-weighing without a finding of intentional misconduct.
And I would, particularly, refer your attention to
the Williamstown Stockyards case, where, although it was a
consent order, as counsel for the respondent points out, the
consent order was conditioned upon the assertion that the
offense was not intentional.
Nevertheless, a suspension, I don’t recall whether
it was 20 or 30 days, but it was not less than that

involved

in this case, was issued.
Furthermore, the distinction between intentional and
merely negligent violations of the Act is a very difficult one
to make in practice.
For example, in this case, all we know for a fact
is that the respondent’s scales were accurate and that the
cattle was misweighed.
Respondent did not call the weighmaster to testify
as to why there might be a discrepancy between the true weight
and the weight given by respondent,
Q

Were you in Department procedures, would you have

been entitled to call him as an adverse witness?
MR. JONES:

I can’t answer that with confidence,

41
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I assume that he could have been
called.

1 understand it is not generally the practice to call

the employees of the respondent -«■ of the person subject to
sanction.
So that distinctions made between intentional and
negligent misconduct are really very difficult ones to make,
and, in this case, as in almost all cases, the final finding
of the Secretary was simply one of willfulness, and net one
of intentional misconduct.
And it is the willful violation which, in almost
all these cases, is the one which is subject to sanction.
That’s all I have, Your Honor.
I®. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
MR. EILBOTT:

I don't suppose I could have one

minute of what he left?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ho.

We don't permit

a surrebuttal, counsel.
MR, EILBOTT:

Thank you.

Thank you for your

kindness in hearing us, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.
