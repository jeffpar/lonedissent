MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 71-6272. Robinson against Neil.
Mr. Robinson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT.OF JAMES D. ROBINSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBINSON;

Mir. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Mr. Jerry Summers is here with me as co-counsel
on behalf of the petitioner in this case.
The sole issue involved in this case is whether the
decision of Waller v. Florida decided by this Court in 1970
declaring an end to the "dual sovereignty" theory with respect
to criminal prosecutions by the states, should be accorded
retroactive application.
With the Court's indulgence, I would like to briefly
review the history of this case.
Tha petitioner was tried and convicted of assault
and battery in the City Court of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in
three cases receiving a $50 fine on each.

He was later

indicted by the Grand Jury of Hamilton County, Tennessee,
in three cases of assult with intent to commit murder.

The

occurrences giving rise to the indictments were the same as
the city cases.
The petitioner in the State cases entered pleas of

4
guilty and received sentences of 10 years, 3 to 10 years,
and 3 to 5 years running consecutively.

The petitioner is

now in custody of respondent Warden, pursuant to the
sentences imposed in the Criminal Court of Hamilton County,
Tennessee.
In 1966, the petitioner filed a petition for writ
of habeas corpus in the Criminal Court of Davidson County,
Tennessee, contending double jeopardy.
denied, and on appeal
affirmed.

.

The petition was

the Supreme Court of Tennessee

Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for a

writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court
in Chattanooga contending double jeopardy.
was denied in June 1967.

This petition

On appeal the Sixth Circuit Court

of Appeals affirmed in April of 1968.
In April 1970, following Waller v. Florida, the
petitioner filed a petition for ’writ of habeas corpus contending
again double jeopardy.

This petition'

for writ of habeas

corpus was filed in the U.S. District Court again in
Chattanooga.

The petition was sustained by the U.S. District

Court and the respondent appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals and the decision of the District Court was reversed.
QUESTION;

Mr. Robinson, do I understand there were

four years between the first conviction and his complaint of
double jeopardy?
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, your Honor, that’s approximately —

5
QUESTION:

Do you know why he waited so long?

MR. ROBINSON;

Your Honor» I did not represent the

petitioner at that timeo

I am unaware of why there would be

the delay between his conviction and the first petition for
habeas corpus in the State of Tennessee.
QUESTION:

Is that a usual, ordinary event in your

courts, such a time lapse?
MR, ROBINSON;

Your Honor, I don't really know how

to answer that because it would vary from case to case.

It would

depend perhaps on the circumstances, the attorney representing
th© defendant.

We do have, of course, access to law resources

in the state penitentiary at Nashville, and it could be that
the defendant himself came in contact with this source or
with other people there.
QUESTION;

Where was he between the time of the

conviction in the municipal court for assault and battery
and got a $50 fine and the time when they indicted him on
the state charge?
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION;

All the time.

MR. ROBINSON;
QUESTION;

He was in custody, your Honor.

Yes, your Honor.

No interruption.
%

MR. ROBINSON;
QUESTION;

No, your Honor.

That might explain' why there was no

hurry, I suppose, or at least why someone thought there was

6
no hurry, because he wasn’t going anywhere.
MR. ROBINSON:

Well, I believe — perhaps I mis­

understood Mr. Justice® question earlier.

There was not a

very big time lapse between the trial in City.Court and the
trial in State Court, but there was a lapse of about 4 years
between the conviction in State Court and his first petition
for writ of habeas corpus in the State of Tennessee.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ROBINSON:

I misunderstood your response.

-It's our position on behalf of the

petitioner that Waller v. Florida should be accorded retro­
active application.

We respectfully submit that this is more

than an attack on the fairness of the trial.

It is our

position that the second trial, that is the trial in the
State Court of Tennessee, was in violation of the Fifth
Amendment

prohibition against double jeopardy.
Insofar as a discussion of whether a principle laid

down by this Court should be applied prospectively or retro­
actively, there are certain guidelines set out in the case
by this Court of Linkletter v. Walker in 1965.
QUESTION:

Now, this question only arises on the

assumption that the crime was the same in the two cases.
MR. ROBINSON;
QUESTION:

Is there any dispute about that?

MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

I don*t believe there is.

I thought, you had to prove some element

7
in the second case you didn't in the first.
MR. ROBINSON:

No, your Honor.

We touched upon

this in our brief, because this was a point of contention in
the lower courts.

But this point is conceded by the respondent

that the occurrences giving rise to both the City Court
QUESTION:

Maybe it's conceded by him.

What about

the fact — is there soma element in the crime that was
charged second, was it. necessary to prove something that, it
wasn't necessary to have proved in the first trial?
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, your Honor, there would be»

In

the City Court, the charges were simple assault and battery.
QUESTION:

Yes.
4

MR. ROBINSON:

And in the State court, they were

aggravated assult with intent.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. ROBINSON:

Now, is that double jeopardy?

Your Honor, we submit that it is

because it arises out of the same transaction.
QUESTION:

All right, but you have to claim double

jeopardy on that basis rather than the identity of the crime.
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Now, have five Justices in this Court

ever taken the transactional approach to double jeopardy?
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, I am unable to answer

that question.
QUESTION:

Well, the answer is no.

I wrote the

8
dissent supporting the transaction, and only two others ever
concurred with me in that opinion.

There were only two of

my colleagues who ever joined rae in that.
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Well, let's assume that you are wrong

in that, would you say if the transactional approach isn't
taken, then the question is the identity of the crimes.

Is

it that there is double jeopardy involved if you have to
prove an additional element at the second trial?
MR.. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, it's our position that

it is since they spring from the same conduct, but not
same charges.
QUESTION:

the

•*
Now you are getting back to transactional
% .

•-

again.
MR. ROBINSON:

The essential elements would be at

least identical insofar as the assault arid battery is concerned.
QUESTION:

The same evidence rule, however, calls

for the application of double jeopardy doctrine only if the
same evidence is required in the second as in the first trial.
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, sir.

I think this case would

satisfy that requirement.
QUESTION:

There is a whole element in the second

crime that is different from the first one — intent.

One

is simple assault and one is something else.
MR. ROBINSON:

We submit that the proof, though,

9

insofar as the two charges are concerned, assault and
battery

and that required in the intent would be identical,
QUESTION:

When the judge instructed the jury in

the second case, he was obliged presumably to instruct the
jury that they had to find intent.

How they found it would

be another question, but that would be required, would it not,
under Tennessee law?
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, your- Honor.

Well, in the

State Court cases, there were pleas of guilty entered, so it
did not reach that stage insofar as the trial is concerned.
QUESTION:

But had it been tried, there would have

been an instruction on the intent, I assume.
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that's correct.

The jury would have to make an affirma­

tive finding on an element which was not involved in the
$50 case.
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, sir, insofar as the intent only

is concerned, it would be.
QUESTION:

I suppose you could argue, Mr. Robinson,

that if we are talking about the same evidence test that
frequently no separate evidence is introduced on the element
of intent.

All it amounts to is an additional charge to the

jury to find perhaps from the same evidence that was admitted
in the trial that didn’t involve intent there was this
added element.

10

MR. ROBINSON;
case,,

Yes, your Honor, that's exactly the

I don't feel like there would be any need of additional

proof introduced insofar as the showing of intent is concerned,
because this would be a determination by the jury upon the
instruction by the Court.
QUESTION;

Apparently the United States District

Court in this case and the Court of Appeals agreed with you
because the Court of Appeals says the only question is the
retroactivity of Waller .
MR. ROBINSON;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.

And the District Court seems to go on the

assumption that it was the same evidence, the same offense.
So if there remains any question about that, should we decide
that the District Court was

in your favor on the retro­

activity question, I suppose we would remand it for considera­
tion by the courts below as to whether or not the offenses
were identical.

It's not for us to decide that question here,

is it?
MR. ROBINSON;

No, your Honor.

that I overlooked mentioning.

There is one matter

That is the matter of assault

and battery,, would be a lesser included offense in the charge
of aggravated assault with intent to commit murder so far as
the State charges are concerned.
QUESTION;

That may be, but they weren't acquitted.

MR. ROBINSON;

No, your Honor, they were found

11
guilty on a plea of guilty.
QUESTION:

If he had been acquitted of an included

lesser offence, maybe that's a different story in the double
jeopardy.

But hare they were found guilty of simple assault

first and then aggravated assault next.
QUESTION;

They pleaded guilty.

MR. ROBINSON:

They pleaded guilty in the State and

were found guilty.
It's our position, of course, that the entire
second trial is the matter that was in violation of the
petitioner's constitutional guaranty under the Fifth Amendment.
Insofar as the criteria -this Court has laid down with regard
to applying a new principle retroactive or prospectively, the
three matters have been, one, th© purpose of a new rule,
and, two, the reliance on the old rule by law enforcement
officials, and, three, the effect on administration of
justice by retroactive application of the new rule.
A 1969 case of Benton v. Maryland, the double
jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment was held applicable
to the States by this Court

through the Fourteenth Amendment..

This decision was recognized as being retroactive in the
■' ’ *

cases of Ashe v. Swenson and Price v, Georgia.
With respect to the first criteria as to the purpose
of the new rule, we submit that the purpose is self-evident,
to prevent two branches, a State and a city, of the same

12
government from trying a person twice in violation of the
Fifth Amendment for the same occurrence.
So far as the second criteria is concerned, the
reliance on the old rule by law enforcement officials, we
submit that the 1907 case of Grafton v. U.S. wherein there
was a prosecution by a court of the U.S. was held to be a bar
to subsequent prosecution, by territorial court since both
are arms of the same sovereign, that this case is applicable
and germane to the case under discussion insofar as the
city prosecution and then later the State prosecution

in the

present case.
It has been recognized by the courts of Tennessee
from the latter part of the nineteenth century that the
city is but an arm of the State, and therefore is but one
sovereign involved v/ithin the State of Tennessee, the city
being but merely a subordinate part of it.

And we submit that

the State of Tennessee should not be permitted to justify the
act in the past of trying persons both in City Court, and later
in State Court on reliance since the city had notice by
judicial determination that the city was but a part of the
State and there was just one sovereign

within the State of

Tennessee.
In the case of Reynolds v, Sims, a legislative
reapportionraent case by this Court in 1964, the Court held
political subdivisions of States — counties, cities, or whatever

13
— never were and never have been considered as sovereign
entities.

Rather they have been traditionally regarded as

subordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the
Stats to assist in carrying out of State government functions.
The relationship of States to the Federal Government could
hardly be less analogous.

We submit that this is important

insofar as the second point, of Link letter v. Walker is
concerned, that with the combination of the Grafton v. U.S.
case, the cases within the State of Tennessee recognising
the city was but an arm of the State, and in the Reynolds v„
Sims case that there was no reasonable basis for reliance of
the State of Tennessee on this rule separating city charges
and then State charges because they are both part of the
same sovereign.
Insofar as the third criteria of Linkletter v. Walker
is concerned, that is, the effect on administration of justice
of a retroactive application, the respondent has submitted
letters and affidavits in regard to this phase.

A review of

these letters from ten States expressed the view that the
Waller v, Florida decision would have little or no effect on
the administration of justice in their State if it was given
a retroactive application.
to make an evaluation.

Four States had insufficient data

Seven States there was no response.

It is significant there were only two States, Tennessee and
Washington, expressing the opinion that a retroactive application

14
of Waller would have a substantial effect on administration
of justice.
Insofar as the reply from the State of Washington
is concerned, at page 61 of the appendix, it was stated that
in the State of Washington a retroactive application of
Waller v. Florida quite possibly could affect the administration
of justice in that State.
So we submit that it essentially boils down to one
State insofar as this material that was collected by the
respondent and that even insofar as the State of Tennessee is
concerned, there is only one county that would be affected by
a retroactive application of Waller v. Florida.

In the

affidavit of Attorney General of Shelby County, Memphis,
Tennessee, submitted by the respondent, Appendix page 22, it
is stated that a retroactive application of Waller v, Florida
would have but a minimal effect on felony cases.

This

affidavit further states that 15 percent of the then present
misdemeanor cases would be affected by a retroactive application
of Waller v. Florida.

W© feel like it's significant this

affidavit is dated October 30, 1970, and under Tennessee law
the maximum punishment for misdemeanor is 11 months and 29 days.
So these people would certainly have served the time by now
and it would have no effect so far as the misdemeanor cases
are concerned.
We respectfully submit that a review of this data

15'

submitted by the respondent, would appear to limit any effect
on the administration of justice to Chattanooga, Hamilton
County, Tennessee, and there is some speculation contained
insofar as this effect is concerned in the affidavits and other
materials submitted in this regard.
Nonetheless, it would appear even other counties in
Tennessee were not engaging in the unconstitutional act. of
trying a person in City Court and then in State Court, and
that it would seem to boil down to a proposition of the City
of Chattanooga using their ordinances and prosecutions in
City Court as a revenue-raising device.

We respectfully

submit on behalf of the petitioner that Waller v. Florida
should be afforded retroactive application and the judgment
\-

of the District Court should be reinstated and the judgment
of the Court

Appeals be vacated and the petitioner be

discharged from custody.
May it please the Court, we would like to reserve
a few minutes for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Durham.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BART C. DURHAM, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF
MR. DURHAM:

RESPONDENT

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
With regard to the issue of transactional approach,
the same evidence approach, of course, we didn't ask for

1G
certiorari in this case.

We were satisfied with the judgment,

of the Sixth Circuit, which only reached the retroactivity
question.
QUESTION:

Well, that's the only question brought

in the Court, of Appeals.
to them, isn't it?

That's the only question you brought

That's what they say in their opinion.

MR. DURHAM:

I think that is the only on© they

considered, your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's the only one you brought to them.

Am I wrong about that?
MR. DURHAM:

I think you are perhaps correct.

I

wasn’t counsel then.
QUESTION:

That is what Judge Peck says in the

opinion of the Court of Appeals.
MR.

DURHAM:

QUESTION:

Yes.

I suppose you are free to support the

judgment in this Court on any precisive ground, aren't you.
whether it was raised in the court below or whether even if
it was rejected in the court below.
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:

Yes, we are, your Honor.
What about this issue of double jeopardy?
Well, I think it's a very profound

question and I would have hardly expected the Court when it
granted certiorari on retroactivity —
QUESTION:

Well, nobody forces you to rely on that

17
ground if you don't want to.
MR. DURHAM:

— to have gone beyond that.

I did

in doing research trying to find out how other Statas have
been affected by the Waller rule find that this happens, quite
frequently.

I will give you two examples.

A young man is

brought in the juvenile court and some adjudication is made.
Then he is tried as an adult.

The burden of proof is different

and so forth.
The most frequent example, however, are in your
DWI cases.

A person is arrested and charged in City Court

with that.

Perhaps he has hit someone —*
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:

Driving while intoxicated.
— and perhaps he. has struck another
■M

vehicle, and then the victim dies and there

are a number of

cases that the Supreme Court of Florida, I believe, and
other states have decided since this Court's opinion in
Waller which say that even though you bring a man in the City
Court and convict him of driving while intoxicated, you are
not thereafter barred to a trial of murder or homicide if
the person he hit while he was drunk later dies.
So it. is a very profound argument, and frankly I
wasn't prepared to really stress that.

But if the Court wants

to adopt that —
QUESTION:

I don't know anything about what, proof

it takes for these two offenses in your State.

No one gives

18

us any authority.

How can we do other than if it's still an

open issue, send it back for a 3™judge court to look into it?
Certainly we aren't competent here to. do it, are we?
MR. DURHAM:
and battery.

No, sir.

The two offenses are assault

We all know where assault and battery is.

The

other offense is assault and battery with intent to commit
first-degree murder.

And first degree murder is lying in

wait, committing the act by poison.

And the reason they have

the intent on there, of course, is that the victim didn't
die.
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:

Your State Court should look at them.
Well, I am sure your Honors know -No, I don't know what your Tennessee

courts would do with them.
MR. DURHAM:
notice

Well, your Honors should take judicial

of • Tennessee law, and I know your Honors know that

pure and simple assault does not include as an essential
£

ingredient of the offense premeditation with intent to commit
first degree murder.
QUESTION;

Are these the same crimes then or not?
a’

MR., DURHAM:
no.

Under the rationale as an alternate,

Assault and battery is pushing someone, slapping him in

the face.

Assault
with intent to commit first degree murder
*

is where you commit first degree murder except your victim
doesn't die

19
QUESTION:

The simple assault would be a lesser
'

included offense in the other one, wouldn't it?
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:

I am not so sure.
I see.

But even if it was — if it was

and there was an acquittal, there might be a real argument
about double jeopardy there.
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM;
cases.

Yes, sir.
But there was a conviction.
Yes, sir, and

guilty pleas in both

And that's not being challenged here.
I believe your Honors have a case, somebody against

the United States,involving the less included offenses on the
calendar this week or next week, and that's a very profound
question.
There have been other people in Tennessee prosecuted
to answer some of my adversary's points.
Douglas v. Nixon, is a Sixth circuit case.

The Douglas case,
That's a reported

t

case which arose after Waller, and they followed Judge Peck's
opinion.

The District Attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee,

where Memphis is located estimated that approximately 40
serious felonies in that county xjould be affected by this.
That's on page 25 of the appendix.

On page 21 of the appendix,

Mr. Clyde Sanders who is the Clerk there irt Chattanooga, says
that 95 percent

of all their cases they handle by bringing

them first in the City Court and then take them over into

20

Stata Court,
QUESTION:

Well, after Waller, that sort of a policy

has got to be examined pretty carefully, don’t you think?
MR,- DURHAM:
QUESTION;

That policy stopped on April 6, 1970„
Is that the date of Waller?

MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
What problem would stem in that, situation

from the retroactive application of Waller that ought not "to
from it?

I mean, like he did.

You wouldn’t say it had a

serious impact, on the administration of justice that people
could no longer be tried once in the county court or once in
the city court and then once in the state court since that is
what Waller was designed to eliminate.
MR. DURHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
What is the disadvantage to the administra­

tion of justice that would result from applying it retroactive?
MR. DURHAMwould be affected,

if

In.terms of the number of people who
this.Court heard argument in December

of this year and decided the case normally sometime in 1973,
there wouldn’t be a great deal of people probably affected.
I said 40 from Shelby County.

That’s one county in Tennessee.,

And Judge Peck in the Sixth Circuit said

possibly

9 of

23 States had some*
But the important thing is the continuing argument
that keeps arising about the retroactivity of decisions of

21
this court.

And it's a philosophical question of is this

the proper category case to deny retroactivity?

And we

believe it is,
QUESTION:

Well, at this late date, isn't it rather

difficult to generalise about that problem?

Don’t you have

to deal with that on a case-by-case basis, depending on the
subject matter?
MR, DURHAM:

Yes, sir.

In fact, we can do that here.

We are always aware, of course, that it affects hundreds of
people other than the litigant.

But in the instance here, for

example, this particular man Robinson, he entered a plea of
guilty in City Court in 1962, he entered a plea of guilty in
State Court in 1962.

In 1966 he filed a State habeas proceed­

ing which was unsuccessful.

In 1967 he filed a Federal

habeas proceeding which was unsuccessful, based on the double
jeopardy, trying to anticipate the Waller rule.
Circuit, affirmed him in 1968.

The Sixth

Then Benton was decided in

1969 and Waller in 1970.
So he has to go back and, of course, take advantage
°f Waller.

Our job is to try to convince your Honors that

the tests you gave for determining retroactivity are good
ones and that they should be applied here.
QUESTION:
why should Waller
retroactive?

Why should this one not be retroactive
not be retroactive if Benton was held

MR. DURHAM:
finding process.

very simple, your Honor, the fact-

Benton was a case in which a man was found

not guilty of burglary, tried again and found guilty.
is a serious doubt about whether he is guilty,

There

Ashe v. Swenson,

another case where you call into play the guilt, or innocens®
of the man.

But here you have got all the criteria for not

QUESTION;

But fch® difference is whether or not the

trial should have taken place, at all or not.

Now, how can

you call the integrity of the process into more question than
to say the trial should never have taken place at all?
MR. DURHAM:

Well, in Benton, of course, we know

by this Court’s law that the second Benton trial should never
hav© taken place.
QUESTION:
MR. DURHAM:

And Benton was held retroactive.
Yes, sir.

Benton"s retroactive.

X suppose that the first trial of Mrs. Mapp should never have
taken place.

W© know that all those cases that this Court

has held not to b© retroactive should never have taken place.
So it seems to me that would be begging the question.
QUESTION:

But I don't think that necessarily is

a good answer on Mapp and on the other procedural type issues.
They shouldn't have been tried in the manner that they were,
but presumably the State was entitled to try them had it just
conformed with the procedural constitutional requirements
that were enunciated in these later decisions,

I think the

23
point Justice White is making is that here there never even
should have been a second ferial
MR. DURHAM:
United

at all.

Well , all we can say is that one

States District Judge two years later told us that’s

fine, three Sixth Circuit judges told us that’s fine.

And

I’m presuming this Court had been denying certiorari since
Grafton in 1907 on the same question until finally the rule
was changed in Waller.
To me I see a very big difference and it’s important,
on questions which affect the truth-finding function. Nobody
wants to see Benton tried and acquitted by a jury of 12 people
in the State of Maryland and then tried again and found guilty.
But who wants to let a man loose who pleads guilty to assault
and battery on three counts, three people, and gets a $50
fine and a 25-year sentence, 9 to 25 years, and then get
immunity back, when the sovereign states (inaudible) good
constitutional lav/?

I can see a profound difference, if your

Honor please, between the fact-finding function and other
purposes.
QUESTION:

Well, you say the harm to the administra­

tion of justice here is that the man is tried perhaps
substantially for the same offense but gets widely differing
sentences, serves the smaller of the two, and then as you say
claims immunity from the greater.
MR. DURHAM;

■o

Yes, sir.

It’s just, as wrong, I

24
suppose, to the body politic to allow him pay a $50 fine in
three instances of lying in wait with intent to kill as it.
would be to punish him any other way.
In Linkletter v. Walker and the other cases on
retroactivity, this Court said we ar© going to talk about the
purpos© of the rule, the reliance by the States on the rule,
and the effect cn the administration of justice of the rule.
Now, th© purpose of this rule wasn't to give a
windfall, and Desist said the purpose was the most important
thing.

Now, the purpose of your Honors' opinion in Waller v.

Florida wasn't to give a windfall to the people who had been
brought in the municipal court, the purpose was to conform,
to get the sovereign states to conform their practices to
Federal constitutional law.
are evolving.

And we all know that our laws

We all know that we must have nonretroactivity.

Else there would be this tremendous pressure on this Court
not to come out with decisions that are in keeping with the
evolving law.
I want to make one other observation.

Judge Peck

of the Sixth Circuit pointed out that the retroactivity of a
case in no way turns on the value of the constitutional
guaranty.

The Fifth Amendment is like our jury trial, it’s

a sacred, hallowed right.

But the Benton situation is so

different from the Waller situation that, as this Court said
in the Johnson case, we don't look at what number the amendment

25
is, we look at how the amendment is being applied in the
facts of that case.
Judge Peck wrote in the Michigan Law Review some
of the rationale for the successive municipal-state prosecu­
tions.

He said municipal offenses have historically been
»

considered, to be too petty to bring into panoply the full
constitutional play.

And that's true.

You read

the

opinions of this Court in the writ.
And then the second thing he mentioned was that
the State interests are different from the municipal interests.
The city of Chattanooga really didn't have ■— counsel has
suggested that they use this as a revenue-raising measure.
But they don't have a District Attorney for the city of

system.

I don't know many cities that do in a county

It's a State prosecutor.

And he's the law

enforcement official of the county.

Speeding tickets and

municipal offenses are held in an entirely different, atmosphsre
and in a different context.
Now, I have found other instances, going back —
the first thing was the purpose.

The first criteria was the

purpose, the reliance, and the effect on the administration
of justice.

This Court has said the purpose is the big thing.

And I have talked about the purpose was to get
in compliance.

the States

It wasn't to punish the States, if you want

to use that term, for past mistakes.

It's to get the States

26

into conformt.y with what we think are now proper constitutiona
procedures„
Secondly, the reliance issue.

I don't know how

much stronger it could be, because just by coincidence, as I
pointed out earlier, the Robinson case had gone up on the
same double jeopardy question in the District Court and
the sixth Circuit just two years before and had been affirmed.
And the third aspect is the effect on the administra­
tion of justice.

I don't think we take a head'count of the

number of people who would be released or not released.

I

think we go into the broader area of does this fit within
the standard accepted criteria that w® have used in other
nonretroactivity cases.

If it does, we deny retroactivity,

because we want to be uniform and consistent.
of course, we do grant retroactivity.

If it doesn't,

Of course, w® submit

that it does.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Durham.

Mr. Robinson, you have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. ROBINSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My adversary made reference to the first petition
for habeas corpus that went to the Federal District Court

27
and then the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals being affirmed.
I would submit at that time as the law existed, the double
jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment had not been made
applicable by this Court to the States by reason of the
Fourteenth Amendment, and I feel like that was the basis that
the petition for habeas corpus was denied at that time.
This was changed in this particular instance, of
course, in Benton and then later in this particular- matter
that we have, of course, here today in the Waller case.
We would submit that insofar as the purpose is
concerned which is the first criteria mentioned by the Court
in Linkletter v. Walker that the purpose really that would
appear to be in Waller was to prevent a person from being
subjected to trial in a City Court within a State and then
a later trial by State Court within the same State on the
basis that this is one sovereign, and it's not two sovereigns.
QUESTION:
context.

Well, let's check this in a practical

Suppose a man is charged with reckless driving,

speeding, in connection with a contact accident, and h© is
found guilty, and pleads guilty, in the City Court.

And then

it develops that someone in the car that he struck dies as a
result of injuries.

In your view would that bar prosecution

by the State for manslaughter?
MR. ROBINSON:

No, your Honor, it would not, because

of the transactional approach.

The reckless driving would be

28

a separate offense from the offense of murder or what the
charge might b® insofar as death is concerned.
QUESTION:
here.

Now, you have at least something of that

Perhaps the issue isn't before us, as Justice Stewart

pointed out.

Only retroactivity of Waller was decided.

But

on the merits, when you have the very serious factor, the
element of intent to kill, you have a very substantially
different crime, do you not?
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, you do.

But I still must

get back to the premise that in Tennessee, aggravated assault
with intent to commit murder includes assault and battery as
a lesser included offense, and therefore under the transactional
theory then these would be one -~
QUESTION:

Yes, the transactional theory is not the

doctrine of this Court as of now.
MR. ROBINSON:

But we submit that the two charges

of assault and battery, assault with intent to commit murder
are of the same nature, one is greater in degree perhaps
because of the intent, but they all stem from the same basic
charge.

Proof is practically essential, there being only the

element of intent in the latter.

And this is often left to

the jury to draw a conclusion from the evidence whether the
intent is there.
QUESTION:

I think someone asked your friend

and I will put the same question to you:

If the Court

Durham,

29
concluded — if this Court now should conclude that the
Sixth Circuit was in error in holding Waller not retroactive,
would the correct procedural solution be to send this case
back and give the State an opportunity to deal with the case
on the double jeopardy level?
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, we would ask the Court

to vacate the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals and
grant release of this man on the basis of retroactive applica­
tion of Waller v. Florida.
QUESTION:

Would that court not have to consider

whether Waller controls this case after it was determined that
it was retroactive?
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, this didn’t appear to be

considered by the court below, and I didn’t understand it to be
a question.

Perhaps my adversary and I both were in error

on this particular point.

I understood our appeal here to be

only on the issue of retroactivity of Waller v. Florida.
QUESTION:

Well, Justice White pointed out the

State of Tennessee can undertake to support this judgment on
any ground.
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Even one not reached.

But you wouldn't

think we should reach the merits of any possible double
jeopardy, then, would you?
MR. ROBINSON:

No, your Honor.

I would just hope

30

this Court would find Waller v. Florida retroactively applied
and therefore release the petitioner from custody, or his
release.
QUESTION:

In Waller itself,in announcing the rule

of Waller — I just read it, there is a footnote as I now
read it, that left the State of Florida free in that case to
find that the two offenses in fact were not identical or at
least some of them were not.

It's just that Waller decided

the legal principle.
MR. ROBINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

And remanded the case to the courts of

Florida where I suppose they were free in further proceedings
to determine that in fact at least some of the offenses ware
not. identical.
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, your Honor, that would have to

be made by the lower courts, the determination on that.
QUESTION:

Did the State in its return to the

petition or anywhere up- until now even question whether or not
there was double jeopardy?
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, this was mentioned in

the cour3© of at least oral argument.

I just cannot state

whether it was in any of the written —
QUESTION:

But you really can’t say then that the

Stats really waived the question.
MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, I would say the question

31
has been discussed, but I couldn't say whether it. has been
waived or not.

As I say, I was under the impression that, we

are hare only on the sole question of retroactivity of Waller
v. Florida, and I would suggest that if this Court saw fit
to hold Waller v. Florida retroactive, then it could be sent
back to a lower court for determination there in. line with
the Court's determination on that question.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

Thank you, Mr. Durham.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:37 o'clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
