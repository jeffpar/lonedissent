MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

No. 71-1119, Indiana

Employment Security Division against Essie D. Burney.
Mr. Diamond.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARREL K. DIAMOND* ESQ. ,
-ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. DIAMOND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This appeal by the Indiana Employment Security
Division presents the issue of the validity of certain practices
used by the Division in determining the eligibility of claimants
for unemployment compensation benefits.

These practices,

which are called for by the Indiana law, were held by a
three-judge district court not to comply with requirements of
the Social Security Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond, before you go further, it

would help me if you would clear up the situation, the facts
of the situation.

As I understand it, the appeal board reversed

so what is the posture of the benefits now?

.Arc chsy allowed an<

are they being paid?
MR. DIAMOND;;
tice, to Mrs, Barney

Are you referring here* Mr. Chief Jus­

s case or the general ruling?

I don * t understand the question.

I am afraid

Wtt

the Division officer’s decision to terminate these benefits,

4
I got; the impression that the Division officer in this
case—MR. DIAMOND: In this case?
QUESTION; Yes, had reversed, and it had been reversed
by the appeal board, and that the benefits denied by the
Division officer were then granted.
MR. DIAMOND:

They had in fact been granted much

earlier on the basis of the preliminary injunction and temporary
re s training order issued, by the district court.
The facts of Mrs. Burney's particular case were moot
well before the district court entered its judgment.

In fact,

it became moot at the time that the referee, providing the type
of hearing 2hieh was required by the district court order,
determined that she was not eligible for benefits.
In this case, the first determination by the
deputy was that Mrs. Burney was not eligible for benefits
and that she was unduly restricting the hours in which she was
available for work.
The referee, after a full hearing, upheld that
determination.

The review board, after going over the ease,

hearing argument, determined that the restriction Upon her
hours of possible work was not so severe as to indicate that
she was not available for work within the statutory meaning.
At that time her case was completed.

There was

no appeal to the Indiana Court of Appeals on this.

So Mrs.

5
Burney’s case was moot

at this point, in the same way that

the Java case, also an unemployment compensation case, was
moot, never came before the courts for final decision.
This was a class action, although her particular claim
was not designated as such.

The district court clearly stated

that it was ruling on behalf of Mrs. Burney and of a sub-class
within the original case.

In the original case, there were

actually two questions, one being precisely identical to the
Java issue, and the other, Mrs. Burney’s case, so the district
court divided this into two sub-classes.

While Mrs. Burney’s

particular case was moot at a very early stage, this is a class
action within the scope of the district court opinion.
QUESTION:

Is she the only named plaintiff within this

sub-class?
MR. DIAMOND: Yes, she was.

She intervened in a case

that was filed by a Mr. Hyatt.
QUESTION: And that was a class action and that had
to do, I guess rather directly with the doctrine of the Java
case that was decided arid is not an issue before us.

She was

an individual intervener in that case, v?as she not?
MR. DIAMOND: She was an individual intervenor within
the scope of her case. However, the. district court in its
order spoke of its ruling as going to a sub-class within the
initial order.
pUhJTION; Were there named persons in that order?

6

MR. DIAMOND: No, your Honor.
QUESTION (inaudible}
MR. DIAMOND3 I cannot give you the exact language, but
it was all persons who had initially been determined eligible
for benefits and then at a later time had been administratively
determined no longer to be eligible.
QUESTION; Mrs. Burney was the only one of that class
who was either an intervenes: or a named plaintiff?
MR. DIAMOND; Thafcis correct, your Honor.
QUESTION; And

their case has now been terminated

because she's receiving benefits?
MR. DIAMOND; In fact her benefit eligibility period
ran out sometime ago, your Honor.
QUESTION; 1 see. So she's really out of the case?
MR. DIAMOND: Yes.

.....

QUESTION; There is no named party here as of this
moment?
MR, DIAMOND; There is none.
In considering the question of determination—
QUESTION:

Under our cases, under the controlling

cases, what is the situation then?

Do we still have a live

case here, when there is no named plaintiff in the case in
controversy?
HR. DIAMOND: I cannot say definitely.

court order did. not depend upon the facts of the individual

QUESTIONS Would this be an advisory opinion?
MR» DIAMOND? This would not be an advisory opinion,
your Honor»

There is an injunction—

QUESTION:

Who is the controversy between?

MR. DIAMOND:

At this point the controversy would be

between the Division and all persons within the sub-class as
designated by the district court.
QUESTION: Is there any case you know of that we have
held- MR. DIAMOND: No, your Honor, I do not know of any such
case.
QUESTION: And where do we get jurisdiction?

Suppose

the other side loses, who do you assess costs against—-the claim6.

MR. DIAMOND: I cannot give a firm answer.

This is an

QUESTION: And we don't have such party.

MR* DIAMOND:

So far as I know, there is no

sugh party in this ease.
QUESTIONs

You would be satisfied, X suppose,

wouldn't you, if the—or would you if the decision of the
district court were vacated?
MR. DIAMOND;

If the injunction were--

QUESTION: If the injunction were vacated?
MR. DIAMOND? Yes, as far as the Indiana procedure
is concerned.
QUESTION:

Decide it. one way or the other, I suppose?

MR. DIAMOND:

One way or the other because there

art.5 other esses which would nave to be decided, presenting
- exactly the same issue.
QUESTION: What you are really saying then is, isn't
it, that you would like an advisory opinion from the Court

to cover future cases?

Or strike "advisory."

You would

like an opinion from the Court governing the future cases?
MR. DIAMOND:

Governing future cases and the cases

by which we are now operating.
QUESTION: If this were dismissed and the district
court judgment ware held of no effect, then the initial
effect would be exactly the same, unless of course a new
action were brought?

Could.X ask you since the judgment

in district court, has Indiana been following it or not?

9

MR„ DIAMOND:

Yes, your Honor, since that 'time when

a deputy has made a dtermination of ineligibility, if the
claimant files a notice of appeal, benefits are still paid
until the referee hearing and referee decision«
QUESTION; This hearing covers no other persons of the
class?
MR. DIAMOND* Within the present time. If this ware
vacated, it would then go back I assume to the prior practice.
This

would be a decision to be made by the Division, and not by

our office, and then the class would come back into it.

If

the injunction were no longer in effect.
QUESTION: The fact is there is probably no other
member of this class that could now intervene in the law
suit, because you have made sure there isn't any other member
of the class?
MR, DIAMONDThat is true, because we like to follow
district court injunctions.
QUESTION: Well, if the district, court injunction
were vacated, you Would soon have more people coming into that
class?
MR. DIAMOND: I would assume so, because I would
assume

the decision is not mine to make—hut I assume that the

Division then would go back to something like its prior
practices,
If I may than deal briefly with the types of

10

determinations which are involved here, in determining a
claim for benefits, there are basically three determinations
to be made.
analysis.

Breaking this down into three is for purposes of
As a matter of law, there are only two.

The first of these is a determination of insured
Status.

This is merely whether the claimant has had enough

work and has earned enough wage credits in a covered employment
to be eligible for benefits, if he meets the eligibility require­
ments .

This determination says nothing about whether the

person is eligible or not eligible.

In fact, a person can

even request this determination when he is still employed.
The second determination is to eligibility and this I
have broken down into two parts.
The first issue goes to the reason for termination
of the prior employment.

That is.- basically whether the termina­

tion was attributable to the employer or to the employee.
The third issue which is involved in this case is a
continuing question of the conduct of the claimant during the
period of the unemployment.

Each week the claimant is required

)

to continue to be unemployed, to be able to work, to be available
for work, making an independent effort to secure work, to not have
refused an offer of a suitable job or not have refused instruc­
tors by the Division to apply for a job which would be suitable.
The determination is made each week by the Division,
and it is on this basis that the determination of eligibility

11
ror than week is made.

There is never any determination by

ox vision which would have any effect for anything past, the
ciiae ox that week.

This is like in a sense pay for looking for

yjor.-c f snd you don * t get paxd until after you have done the "job.
When a person comes in each week to present his
claim, lie is required to establish that, he has mat these
cri cena.

This establishment may come about by his certifica~

tion upon the voucher ronn that he has met these requirements.
It may come by an interview type hearing with a claims deputy.
IfiLii hearing would oe basically similar to a hearing on an
luii,i3i claim which was described by this Court in its opinion
in the case of California Department of Human Resources
Development versus JavaThe claimant is called in, the
question which raises the doubt is discussed.

If there is

anyone else who would have information, the deputy finds that
information and he reaches a determination of whether or not
the person was eligible for that particular week.
That decision is as much an initial decision in
that, sense as is the first week, the only difference being that
in the normal situation, it is not necessary each week to
determine the questions of why the previous employment was
terminated.
In this case, Mrs. Burney was determined by the
Division, oy die Deputy not to be available for work and that
sbe- '-'.-as unduly restricting the hours for which she was available

for work.

In the other cases presenting the sane issue

in the New York case of Torres, there was the plaintiff# Hr.
Dinger, who was found by the Division not to be making an effort
to secure work.

In the Vermont case, Wheeler versus Vermont,

there was a determination there that the claimant had refused
to seek work when directed by the Division.

In the California

case, Mrs. Crow was determined to have refused an offer of
suitable work.
Then these questions arose, it was necessary to make
a determination of the prior week5s conduct, because each of
these questions is a condition precedent to eligibility
for unemployment compensation benefits.

This is a different

type of system than the welfare system, in which there is an
initial determination of status, such as a family has a child
or children who are dependent within the definition of 42 U.S.C.
Section 606 that it is a needy child living with a designated
relative who is deprived of the parental support of at least
one parent.

In those cases, once a determination is made, it

continues in effect and it is necessary to have a hearing
because a prior determination having continuing effect is now
being changed.
The welfare recipient has no such affirmative duties
to go out and look for work, to be available for work and not to
refuse work.

So we have a completely different situation here,

The welfare situation is not applicable to this case at all.

13

In looking t<

this Court's decision in Java last year,

which was held by the district court to be disposative of the
issue, I believe that the rule of law of the Java court
actually supports the position of the Division in this case»
In Java, you had an initial determination by the deputv
in the California Department as to the eligibility of a
particular claimant.

After that determination had been made,

one of the parties to that case filed a notice of appeal and
that notice of appeal was sufficient in itself to call for a
termination of benefits, even though in that case the Division
had determined that the benefits were due, so you were allow­
ing a party to upset the decision of the impartial agency.
In this case, we merely have the other party seeking
to overturn the decision of the impartial agency that benefits
are not due.

This is merely two sides of the same coin.

I would emphasize in this respect that the Indiana
Employment Security Division is an impartial arbiter in these

<

cases. The State of Indiana and the Division have no interest
in whether or not these payments are made, in the sense that
the money used to pay these benefits comes from employers
and not from the state treasury.

The administrative expenses,

so long as the plan is held to be in compliance with the
federal law, are paid by the federal government.

The interest

of the state agency is merelyin having a workable system
in which the authority of the impartial arbiter is upheld and

the duties placed upon claimants by the Social Security Act
and the state unemployment compensation laws are met.
When Congress passed the provisions of the Social
Security law dealing with the questions of unemployment compen­
sation, they had before it a general outline of what an unem­
ployment compensation plan would be like., and this included
these issues.
The District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation
Code, which was then passed by Congress, includes these same
provisions.
So as a result, we have the determination by the
agency that a party is not eligible for benefits.

We have a

claimant for whatever reason, in most cases probably because of
a sincere question as to the fact, but as was pointed out in the
Java

case, possibly by an arbitrary desire or merely by a

desire to have the short-run benefit, may file a frivolous appaaL
and there's no way to determine this until the referee decisi
has been made and in some cases on from there to the review
board, and from there to the Indiana Court of Appeals.
The issue of due process has been presented in
this case.

I am not sure that it is an issue in this case/

except in the following way.
the due process

5

The District Court did not rule on

resented under Goldberg y

„ '

It did however require the Division to provide a prior due
process hearing and dxd not explain what that hearing snould

15
consist of.

The Division filed a motion for amendment of

judgment to show what that hearing would consist of, and the
District Court refused thatraction, being unable or unwilling
to say what a due process hearing is, and I believe it is clear
from the law that there is no such thing as a due process
hearing in the sense of a specific set of requirements.
Due process is a much more general phrase which would vary
from period to period and from case to case.

What is due pro­

cess in one situation would not be due process in another, and
what would he a denial of due process in one situation would
provide due process in another situation.
•Therefore, it is necessary to look at this question
within the realm of the unemployment compensation and not in the
question of welfare, even though both of these programs are
under the Social Security Act, and determine whether the deputy
determination would be a proper determination in this case?
whether the deputy determination itself is a due process hearing
within the scope of the District Court orderu

'since'-the

District Court refused or was unable to clarify that order
the Division felt it was necessary to give it the strictest
possible interpretation, because they didn’t know what might
put them in contempt of court.
Since the injunction was presented, there is the
deputy determination which is basically the same question, the
same procedure as was presented in the Java case? t;hat is, the

16
deputy intervenes, the claimant interviews other persons
'having information about it.
How in the disability cases, for example, frequently
there will be no employer party, because the prior employer
would haveno way of having knowledge as to the behavior of the
claimant after this period.
After ail this information is presented and in most
of these cases, the information comes exclusively from the
claimant himself, the deputy determines the facts and determines
whether that brings a person within one of the limitations,
whether in that situation the person is eligible.

However,

since the District Court injunction was entered, the deputy
determination is made in the same way.

However, the deputy

determination of ineligibility is .not given effect if the
claimant expresses a desire to appeal to a referee, but rather
benefits are paid, despite the fact that there's never been
a determination of eligibility for that period, until a
referee hearing, and the written formal referee opinion is
handed down.
QUESTION: Would you again spell out just how that

I...

differed from what ocurred before the injunction?

What did you

do before the injunction?
MR. DIAMONDS

Before the injunction when the deputy

made the-determination, if the deputy determined that the
eligible for benefits, benefits were not paid

17
for that week,
QUESTION:

Then I gather if the claimant appealed

and prevailed on the appeal, and benefits were resumed, would
they be retroactive?
MR. DIAMOND: They would be retroactive.
QUESTION: And were you not constrained, as you
believe you are by the injunction, to do what you are presently
doing, I take it you would go back to that procedure, would you?
MR. DIAMOND: I believe that it would go back to that
procedure.

This is a ruling made by the Division, of course,

not by our office.
QUESTION: Yes, but I gather then that the real problem
here is whether pending decision on the appeal by the referee
benefits shall or shall net be terminated?
MR. DIAMOND:

That is basically the question.

However,

I'd have to take issue with the statement you used in that
there is no termination of benefits.

There is one poind I'd

like to emphasize most clearly.
QUESTION:

They are simply not made?

MR. DIAMOND:

Simply there's never been any determina­

tion that the claimant was eligible for any period other than
past weeks and the question of what happened in past weeks does
not control what happens in

the week in question.

QUESTION: In other words, what you are saying is that
\

>•

.; •-

\

’

'

18
there is a burden of proof every week on the part of the

claimant<

and he must meet that burden of proof?
MR. DIAMOND? Yes, he must come in and certify;

that he has met these requirements.

He must fill out the certi­

fication, or, if it is a time when there is an interview, at
that time they will discuss what he has been doing during the
time, what efforts he has made to secure work, what he has
been doing.

At that, time also they might suggest other ways of

finding work, perhaps looking in a slightly different field,
checking to see if

there is some other type of skill which

the claimant has which would enable him to find work in a
slightly different field.
This is not merely an attempt by the Division to do
a person out of benefits? it is an attempt to find out whether
the person meets the criteria and try to find a way to find him
a job.
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond, it is probably of no conse­

quence , but a while back, you said that the funds carae from the
employer.

Is there no contributory aspect, to this at all,

nothing taken out of the employee's salary when he's working?
MR. DIAMOND;

As I understand it, I believe it is

unlawful for the employer to attempt to deduct any of this
contribution from the employee's wages.
QUESTION; So
MR. DIAKC: E>:

:.n

theory, it is non-contributory then?

It is not a contributory fund.

This is

19
simply payment by the employer himself.

No claimant’s money

is involved# no state money involved.
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond# is there a time limitation

on the period within which an appeal may he made from the
decision of the deputy to the referee?
MR. DIAMOND: Yes# there is.
QUESTION: What is that?
MR. DIAMOND: I believe it is ten days in the
normal case.

In certain cases# if you have an interstate

claimant or the like# it may be IS days.

Bat ordinarily# the

appeal must be presented, within that period of time# and under
Indiana law# that time limit is jurisdictional for consideration
of the next highest level.
QUESTION: That is the time limit on the filing of the
appeal.

What is the experience in terms of how promptly a

hearing may be had before the referee?
MR. DIAMOND:

This varies according to the staffing

of the department and according to the case loads at the time.
At the time, that Mrs. Burney’s case arose# it was a long period
of time# perhaps 10 to 15 weeks.

At the present time# most#

about half the cases or more are being decided by the referee
within 30 days.

This is because primarily of an increase in

the staffing and partly because this is a little bit slacker
time for claims.

Not as many claims are being presented.

QUESTION: And what type of hearing is now afforded

20

a claimant before the referee?

Is counsel provided or allowed?

May witnesses be called?
MR . DIAMOND % Before the deputy?

There were two

questions unless I failed to understand all or both of them.
QUESTION: The question I asked was whether at the
hearing before the referee„ what elements of due process are
now provided in light of the injunction of the district court?
How go they compare with whatpreviously existed?
MR. DIAMOND!

The injunction of the district court

did not affect the referee hearing.
hearing.

This is an administrative

The parties are given notice. They are told that they

may bring witnesses. They may bring counsel or any other
person to assist them in presenting their case. If a party is
not represented, the referee is given the duty of helping them
present their case, bringing out all the facts which might be
relevant to it.
It is like a court hearing in a

sense

except that the

referee has greater duties to make sure that the facts are
presented than an impartial judge who merely sits back and
decides what the case is like. It might: be like a small claims
court in many areas.
I don't think that there is amy question but that the
referee hearing would provide the due process elements under
Goldberg.
QUESTION s

This is true befosre the injunction?

21

MR. DIAMONDs

This was true both before and after.

The practices of the Division have not been changed by the
injunction, except to tine extent that the determination by the
deputy of non-eligibility is no longer given effect.

That is

the only difference in the procedure at this time.
QUESTIONi Inofher words, benefits are paid pending
decision of the appeal?
MR. DIAMONDt That is right, your Honor.
QUESTION: Wht
MR. DIAMONDS

is the maximum of weeks of benefits?
The benefits year can be up to 52

weeks. If there is a situation of

substantial unemployment,

then under a federal program there can be an extended benefit
period beyond that.
QUESTION: Have you any idea what this payment of
benefits pending decision of the referee has meant in
terms--'of financial impact?
MR. DIAMOND: I do not have those figures for Indiana.

X don't believe that those figures have been calculated.
Indiana is also in this regard a small state.
QUESTION:

,

California8 si

indicates $50 million.
MR. DIAMOND: I believe the information I received front
their o ifiee when last talking to them was that an affidavit
in the •-.-row case in California indicated the total cost would
!:;e s orris thing like $16? million there.

This was in extra employe;

22
contributions and extra administrative expenses.
If the benefits are. found to be paid erroneously,
it is necessary to try to bring them back by either collecting
the money or not paying for future weeks of eligibility.
This requires extra administrative help.

For example, the

Indianapolis local claims office, before the injunction, had
one worker spending about half of his time on recouping
erroneous payments.

Now this one office has two employees

full time on this, and this is one local office only.

So there

is an extra administrative load,which expense falls on the
United States Government and not upon the state government,
but it's an extra administrative expense and extra administrative
burden.
QUESTION: Do I infer from what you said that now that
you are paying benefits pending the appeal, where the claimant
loses, an effort is made to recoup either by getting the
money back or perhaps against not paying future benefits?
MR. DIAMOND: Thatis correct.
QUESTION:

How successful has that been?

MR. DIAMOND: I don't know that the figures are
available for this latest period.

Previously they were receiving

repayment on, I think, about 60 to 70 percent. I'm not sure of
the exact figure, but as I remember it, it is in that area.
QUESTION: May I ask you this. When there has been
an initial determination of eligibility and then as you say.

23
there is. a necessity of

rede termination of eligibility,

that redetermination is normally made, most often made just
on the papers, just on a certification that is received?
MR, DIAMOND: Yes, your Honor, when the claimant comas
into the office—
QUESTION:

But he doesn't have to come in each week,

does he?
HR. DIAMOND: Yes, he comes in each week»
QUESTION? You said not for benefits?

He cannot

do it by mail?
MR. DIAMOND;

Only in exceptional cases where the

agency will—
QUESTION: So he comes in each week and he fills out a
blank for that week?
MR. DIAMOND; Yes, the voucher form which he fills out
is a blank IBM card which, will be punched later and includes the
statement, "I hereby certify that I fulfill the registration
for work requirements.

During the compensable week covered by

this voucher, I was unemployed, physically fit, available for
and actively seeking work as except noted herein.”
QUESTION: Now, every now and then on your initiative,
there's an interview?
MR. DIAMOND: Yes, periodically.
QUESTION: Periodically.

Now, is a determination

■if ineligibility after ;m initial determination of eligibility

24

is a determination of ineligibility for some future week ever
made without interview?

Just on the paper?

How about this case?

Was there an interview?
MR. DIAMOND; There was an interview and it was
at the interview that the information came out.
QUESTION: Right, but is it ever done just on
certification?
MR. DIAMOND: Well, if the person refuses to sign a
certification, then there can be no payment, because this
voucher itmsfc be signed and sent in, and it is from this voucher
that payment is made.
QUESTION: But if there is a question which arises,
the claims taker will then refer that to a deputy for the
full interview hearing type?

Does it ever happen that he would

refuse to sign the voucher?
MR. DIAMOND: I am sure it would be unusual but I was
told everything happens, and it does happen sometimes.
PION:

If it happens, dc they take action on it

without asking him for an interview, having an interview?
MR. DIAMOND %

If there is

a question, ordinarily

any time the claims taker sees any issue, this is to be referred
to a deputy for full interview to find out what the situation is.
QUESTION: Thank you. I think you stated prior to the
decision of the district court on appeal from the deputy to the
feree, there were reversals in about 49 pereant of the cases.

25

What has been the experience with respect to appeals since
the district court injunction?
MR. DIAMOND:

It has been about the same.

QUESTION: No change?
MR. DIAMOND: No significant change, your Honor.
I would point out in relation to these statistics that I think
I covered this in the reply brief, but I don't think these are
really relevant to the case and in any event, these show a
somewhat comparable reversal level at the review hjoard of the
referee.

to me, of the Java procedure, it pointed out in a footnote

.MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Mr. Bodensteiner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IVAN E. BODENSTEINER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF ISEPJELLEE.
MR. BODENSTEINER;

Mr. Chief Justice Burger,

may it please the Court;
On the question of mootness, this case comes up

26
in exactly the same posture as Java did.
exactly the same posters as Goldberg

did.

It comes up in
In other words, in

Goldberg? the welfare recipient had also resumed receiving
benefits and had a hearing before the case reached this Court
and before it was finally decided in the lower court.

By the

very nature of the problem that we are dealing with here—
QUESTION:

Could you get in the same trouble again in

both of those cases?
MR. BODENSTEINER:

MR. BODENSTEINER:
case as it was in Java.

It would be true very much in this

In other words, in Java

presumably

Mrs. Java could sometime in the future have another claim.
Here also Mrs. Burney could have another claim.
In the area of Goldberg, they could have another
claim.
QUESTION:

Got any other reason that says this is a

good case in controversy?
MR. BODENSTEINER:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

Have you any other reason that says this

is a case in controversy as of now?
MR. BODENSTEINER:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think we do.

Wouldn’t it be much easier to intervene

somebody?
MR. BODENSTEINER:

Well, I think after the injunction

27

was issued, it did cover the entire class.

In other words,

the lower court defined the class as any recipients—QUESTION:

Coulci any member of that class intervene?

ME. BODENSTEXNER:

They could have, your Honor,

except that after the injunction was issued, they were all
receiving the benefits of the court order.

In other words,

the state was under an injunction not to terminate anyone in
the state without a hearing.
QUESTION:

Why couldn't they intervene to protect

that?
MR. BQDENSTEINER:
QUESTION:

There was one instance—

I understand the law of class action that

any member of the class can intervene at any time.
MR. BODENSTEINER:
QUESTION:

Am I right?

Yes.

Well, why did nobody intervene? Do you

just want us to say that you don't have to insist on that?
MRa BODENSTEINER:

No, your Honor, the reason no one

intervened is because they were receiving the benefits of the
order, and as long as their benefits were not being terminated
without a hearing, they had no reason to intervene.
QUESTION:

Who do you represent now?

MR. BODENSTEINER:

I represent Mrs. Burney and all

members of the class as defined by the lower court.
I think what's important here, because of the very
d sling with, as the court was

20

dealing in Goldberg,, the question is when do you get a hearing?
After the hearing is granted, you know there is no permanent
member, no permanent class representative.

The problem contin­

ues as was indicated earlier that if the order is vacated,
we'd probably be back in the same circumstances; it will be
necessary to relitigate the matter.

So in spite of the fact

that Mrs. Burney has in fact received her hearing, has in fact
received her benefits, the case is still, you know, ripe, and
there is still a controversy.
Now this Court, in addition to Java

and Goldberg,

has ruled similarly in soma earlier cases: in Motor Coach
Employees versus Missouri in 1963, which involved a labor
dispute and seizure of property by the Governor of Missouri.
The property was released before the appeal reached the court,
and this Court ruled on the question.

Likewise in Carroll

versus the Princess Anne College, 'where students were enjoined
from rallying.
QUESTIONs

But in this case, she is no longer eligible

for anything.
MR. BODENSTEINER:
QUESTION:
I right or wrong?

Hot on this particular claim.

She is now not a member of the class.
In the first place, what is the class?

MR. BODENSTEINER:

The class is defined as all

present and future recipients of unemployment compensation
benefits in the State of Indiana.

Including the Deputy Attorney General?

MR. BODENSTEINER:

Possibly.

All right, turning to the narrow issue presented in
this appeal, the question is very simply whether unemployment
compensation benefits of an unemployed worker who has been
determined eligible for benefits, can be terminated without a
prior evidentiary hearing.

We claim there is a right to such

a prior evidentiary hearing, under both the Social Security Act
and the United States Constitution.

The case can be decided

with those who were working, suddenly out of work for

a short-term period, and Congress was interested in taking care
of their short-term need, and for this reason, we feel the case
is even stronger on the Constitutional issue than Goldberg.

The interests

of the state are much less than the interests of the state that

MR. BGDENSTEINER:

That's one way, your Honor, and

the other way is, we must remember that we are dealing with
people who are working, as opposed to welfare where this Court
recognized that there would in effect be no recoupment.
QUESTION:

I take it then that one of your proposi­

tions is that the Indiana method of determining initial eligi­
bility for compensation does not comply with Goldberg versus
Kelly?
MR. BGDENSTEINERs

No, your Honor, we're not dealing.

as the court below pointed out, we are not dealing here with
claimants funds initially ineligible.
QUESTION:

Well, then, 1 will ask you this:

think that the method for determining eligibility or ineligi­
bility in Indiana comports with Goldberg against Kelly?
MR. BGDENSTEINER:

No, that comports with the

procedure outlined in Java for determining—•

So a fortiori, it wouldn't for a redeter-

BODENfcTBXNER:

Well, when we are talking about

now taking that recipient off, that is correct.

We are saying

that the procedure does not comply with Goldberg.

for

determining initial eligibility would pass muster under Goldberg

Would I agree with that?

No, let's assume that is what the court

Then does that settle this case?

MR. BODENSTEINER;
that, I assume it would.

Well, if the Court were to hold

However, we’re saying that these

procedures, Number 1, do not comply with Goldberg. Number 2,
they are not sufficient even unto the Act because at this point
we must remember what the program is all about,.

The program,

as is pointed out in Java, is to give benefits tc unemployed
workers when they're unemployed, and not six months latex- when
they're back to work, so one of the key factors here is that the
program was designed to get these benefits to the unemployed as
soon as possible after they lose their job.
QUESTION:

Doesn't this program differ fro.-., Sori.a.1

ployed worker to prove every week that he has complied with
these standards?
MR. BODENSTEJNER:

The same burden rests on the

welfare recipients, your Honor, as pointed out in Java.
QUESTION:

Are they required to corae in with new

proof every week and sign a new certificate every week?

QUESTIONS

How about in Indiana?

Do you know whether

it is mailed or requires personal appearance there?
MR» BQDENSTBINERs

As a general rule, in Indiana,

it requires personal appearance each week.

As was indicated

earlier, in some cases the certification can be dorse by mail.
The check itself is actually mailed to the recipient.
QUESTIONs

You don't get it when you corae into the

office for your appearance?
MR. BODENSTEINER;

That is correct.

Now, in this case, Mrs. Burney was employed, invol­
untarily lost her last employment, and filed a claim for
unemployment compensation benefits.

As pointed out, she was

found eligible for a period of 22 weeks, to receiv- these
benefits for a period of 10 weeks.

At that time she was

advised by the deputy that she was no longer eligible and the
benefits would be terminated and were in fact terminated at
•that point.
Now, Mrs. Burney's case points out the importance of
a hearing in this context.

The termination was based on

to accept suitable work and an allegation

that she was not. making herself available for work.
this was made, she requested a hearing.
this hearing was held.

After

Three months later

At this time she produced evidence

that sha did in fact have grounds for refusing this job, that

36

she was in fact available for work, and she also demonstrated
that the reason she could not accept this job was because of
tli® lack of proper transportation, the lack of baby sitting,
the fact that the job was in the middle of the night, the fact
she had never worked a night shift, the fact that she had no
car, no public transportation, the job was too far away for
her to walk to.
Now when., the Division was forced to prove its asser­
tion that she had in fact refused suitable work, they were
unable to do so.

As a result, the review board ultimately

ruled in her favor.

description of what is happening?

QUESTION?

If oar affirmance in Torres

was correct,

can you prevail here?
MR. BODEtfSTEINSfc:

Well, I think in dealing with

Torres, the first thing we have to discuss is the fact that
the case is actually pending before this Court now on a peti­
tion for rehearing.

To the extent that Torres raises the same

issues as are present hairs, we disagree with the lower court
decision in Torres.
QUESTIONS

You disagree with us in affirming it,

X

take it?
MR. BODENSTEINERs

1 think as I indicated, it's still

pending on rehearing and to the extent that there is an affir­
mance on the identical issues raised by Plaintiff Dinger, we
would disagree.
QUESTIONS

If that stands, Mr. Rehnquist's question

is, how can yon prevail?
MR. . /ObSNSTITINER:

Insofar as the Torres decision

raises the same issues, and I must point out there ar® soma
distinctions, especially on Plaintiff Torres where it was a
very unusual circumstance involving the initial determination,
but insofar as the issue is exactly the same as raised by
Plaintiff Dinger, we would disagree with that affirmance.
QUESTION:

S' ppose ■

j

How do you stand

ME. BODENSTEINERs

Wall, X think we have to keep in

wind also .that that was a summary affirmance and the Court

MR. BODENSTEINERs

To the extent that the issues

were exactly the same.
QUESTIONS

Well, of course I think I would know

that without asking you that .

the extent the issues ar©

exactly the same, you would be in trouble.

I mean to what

extent are the issues not the same?
MR. BODENS:" fJBR:

They are not the same to the

extent that in that case, the Plaintiff Torres presented a
very unusual circumstance to the Court.

Plaintiff Tojrres was

determined initially eligible for benefits, allegedly without
the employer having any notice of the application, and there­
fore without being involved in the critical procedure which
this Court described in Java, so to that extent, it is a very
unusual circumstance which we clearly don't have here.
the employer was involved £i

Here

that initial determination of

eligibility.
Now concerning the constitutional issue, in Goldberg
this Court found that welfare benefits could not be summarily

43
terminated without according the recipient a prior evidentiary
hearing, as pointed out earlier, this case is uniquely like
Goldberg and in many respects, it is even stronger than
Goldberg.

For example, the factual determinations to be made

in unemployment compensation are more complex than those to be
made in the context of welfare.

The interests of the state in

a summary procedure are much less; hara that; they were in
Goldberg, because of the recoupment proceedings.

„-»s pointed

out, the state recoups over 70 percent, of any wrongful payments.
In Goldberg, the Court recognized there was virtually no
chance of recoupment.
QUESTION?

.. Goldberg *'s

argument only becomes

really cutting if you-are right in saying and in maintaining
that this weakly determination is not a determination of
initial eligibility,

MR. BODENSTEINER:

Yes.

Xr addition here the determination of unemployment
compensation bench; res is a sc rious deprivation and a serious
loss to the recipientas was the welfare even though initial
eligibility is not boned on an individual means test,; Java
and earlier decisions of this Court recognized that Congress
intended-unemployment compensation to meet a short-term need.
Just as welfare providas funds for the old, disabled, blind
and children, unemployment compensation provides•tu ids for
unemployed workers during short-term unemployment.

they didn't want workers to get into relying on;welfare and
therefore not look for jobs.,
Now the need for a prior evidentiary hearing is very
great her* : because of the complex factual issues.

Once a

person is in this continued claim status after the initial
determination of eligibility, the issues that come up subs©
quently are usually, as in Mrs. Burney's case, issues of avail­
ability and issues of refusal of work.
Indiana courts have held that these questions
involved questions of fact which depend on the circumstance in
each case.

For example, is the claimant restrictingthe hours

of work?

Is the claimant restricting herself to certain types

of work?

Is the claimant looking for work?

Was there an actual offer of a job?

la the job suit­
Is the job safe?

Is there transportation to the job?

Is there baby sitting?

What were the previous work habits?

Is the person physically

fit to work at this job?

And we contend that reliance as to

such questions can best be obtained at an evidentiary hearing,
and I think the past experience of the Division with the near
50 parcent «reversal rate indicates that in the past there was
not. a reliable procedure.
As pointed out earlier, the interests of the state

45
iusre are much less than in the welfare situation.

The one

argument advanced by the state in the brief is the need to
