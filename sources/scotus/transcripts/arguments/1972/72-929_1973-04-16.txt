We will hear arguments

Mr. Pfeffer, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC
EDUCATION AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, ET AL.
MR. PFEFFERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This is a suit challenging the constitutionality
of three parts of Chapter 414 of New York Laws of 1972.
That Act consists of five parts.

Part 1 provides public funds

for the maintenance and repair of nonpublic schools.

Part 2

provides funds for tuition in such schools of parents whose
income does not exceed $5,000 a year.

Part 3 provides for

tax credits to parents of children attending such schools,
whose income exceeds $5,000 a year.

Part 4 provides public

funds to public school districts, impacted funds, whose
enrollment increases by reason of the closing down of non­
public schools in that district.

And Part 5 empowers the

public school districts in those areas to purchase unused
or no longer used nonpublic schools.
The suit challenges only the first three parts under
the religion clauses of the First Amendment.
The district court held unanimously that Part 1 and

5
Part 2 are unconstitutional„

By a divided vote, with Judge

Hays dissenting, it held constitutional the third part, the
tax credit part.

And also held that that part was severable

from the rest of the statute.
Judge Hays dissented on both points.
Now, taking each of these parts seriatim, the
maintenance and repair part, the statute is quite broad in
what constitutes maintenance and repair, indeed it’s openended.
It defines maintenance and repair as"the provision
of heat, light, water, ventilation and sanitary facilities,
cleaning, janitorial and custodial services? snow removal?
necessary upkeep and renovation of buildings, grounds and
equipment? fire and accident protection? and such other items
as the commission", that's the State Commissioner of Education,
"may deem necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety
of enrolled pupils."
Indeed, I think it is fair to say that except for
teachers' salaries this statute permits practically the State,
and directs the State to pick up the bill for everything in
those schools.
Now, the only qualifications under the statute are
that the schools be located in low-income areas.

The amount

given to the school for that purpose is $30 per pupil in
attendance, and an additional ten dollars if the school is

6

more than 25 years old»
Now, in Lemon v„ Kurtsman and Earley v. DiCenso,
this Court in 1971 declared unconstitutional State laws in
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island which appropriated public funds
to pay for the secular teaching in religious schools.
On the same day the Court decided these cases, it
decided Tilton v. Richardson, which upheld on its face, not
necessarily as applied, indeed, quite clearly not as applied,
a Federal statute which appropriated flands to pay half the
cost of constructing facilities at colleges.
Now, in Tilton v. Richardson, the plurality opinion,
there was no court opinion, distinguished the Federal statute
from the statutes in the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island cases.
The Court said, in the first place the Federal statute deals
with colleges and universities, and there is a real latitude
given by the Establishment Clause under such circumstances
because the students are mature and they can resist pressure
by the teachers, sectarian pressure and other reasons, and
therefore the limits of governmental action are somewhat
broader, are broader than those in elementary and secondary
schools.
Secondly, the Court pointed out that we had there a
one-time grant in each of those cases.
and that’s it.

The money is given,

Whereas, in the DiCenso and Lemon cases, it

was ongoing payment each year, and therefore there was a

7
greater area of governmental involvement.
Finally, the Court pointed out, that in the Federal
grant, the Tilton grant, the statute specifically forbade the
use of any of those facilities partly financed with public
funds to be used for religious purposes.
And, indeed, in that case, the Court held,
unconstitutional by a unanimous decision that part of the
Federal statute which restricted — which removed this
limitation after twenty years.

After twenty years under the

statute, those Federally financed facilities could be used for
religious instruction? the Court said this is unconstitutional
No funds which come from governmental bodies may be used, to
finance any facility used in whole or in part for religious
instruction or worship.
Now, in the present case, the statute applies to
elementary and secondary schools, not to colleges*

Moreover,

it is not a one-time grant, but it has to be renewed each year
And, perhaps above all, the statute does not forbid the use
of the facilities so financed by governmental funds for
religious or sectarian purposes.
QUESTION:

You're speaking now of Part 1, is that

correct?
MR. PFEFFER:

Part 1, yes? begin with Part 1.

The same rooms which are financed, whose lighting,
whose ventilation, whose upkeep, whose renovation is financed

8

i
with State funds, are used for sectarian instruction and
religious worship.

If there is a chapel in the school, and

many of the schools do have chapels, that chapel, too, is
part of the cost of maintenance and repair borne by the State»
The statute provides that only 50 percent of the
average State cost of maintenance and repair of public schools
may be appropriated for these schools; and in no case more
than the 100 percent of moneys actually used for these purposes
in the parochial schools may be used.
But there is no distinction within the statute
between those parts of the building, indeed, it's questionable
whether it could be, with those parts of the building used for
religious purposes and those for sectarian purposes»
Now, I do not believe, as a matter of fact, as I
read the briefs, there is, I believe, implicit admission that
if this statute applied to all nonpublic schools, it would
clearly be unconstitutional»

I don‘t see how it can be

denied,
There is an effort to justify the statute on the
police power of the State to provide for the safety and health
of students.

Well, the police power has to be exercised

within the restrictions of the First Amendment»
In Flast V»Cohen, this Court held that there is an
express provision in the Constitution, the First Amendment,
forbidding governmental financing of parochial schools.

9

I do not know of any case in which the Court has
held that where there is an express prohibition in the
Constitution, that can be transgressed under the police power»
The police power of a State is inherent in them, it is used to
““ the word "police", its origin, it's used for the security
and safety of the people, to arrest criminals or those who
are charged with crime, to charge them, convict them, and
punish them.

But that doesn't mean that under the police power

a State can violate an express prohibition against double
jeopardy, let tis say, or trial without jury, or trial without
counsel.
Surely, the public has an interest, the State has an
interest in the education of children; but it must be
exercised in such a way that it does not violate the specific
prohibition of the Bill of Rights,

No matter how wise, no

matter how effective a trial without jury, or double jeopardy^
or trial without counsel would be in preventing crime in the
streets, that cannot stand, that cannot justify a specific
prohibition in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights,
And in Flast v„ Cohen, the whole basis of the
decision was that the Establishment Clause is a specific
prohibition, the first prohibition in the Bill of Rights,
against a financing of the operations of parochial schools.
The State seems to also, indeed clearly bases its
position on this, in this Part, that this statute is limited to

10

schools in low-income areas.
Again I know of no decision of any court holding
that to be a critical or relevant constitutional question.
Where the question is equal protection, if the State
chooses a certain class as beneficiaries of its action, and
excludes other classes, as, for example, if the State provides
free counsel in a criminal case, which indeed it must, to
poor people but not to wealthy people, or provides free access
to the divorce court, as indeed it must, to poof people but
not to wealthy people, or in other cases provides the
transcript of criminal trials to the poor but not to wealthy
people —
•

QUESTION*
MR. PPEPPER*

Not to poor people, it's to indigents,
Indigents.

To indigent people, well,

if the State did that, then, quite clearly, this would not —
this was a rational classification, not to violate the equal
protection.

But the State could constitutionally provide

free access to divorce courts, to bankruptcy courts, to free
transcripts, to public defense service, to all, to the wealthy
as indeed it does in public schools»

Public schools are open

to everybody, the wealthiest as well as the most poor.
And it’s not a violation of equal protection because
a reasonable classification, if the State chooses one
alternative, free for all, or the other alternative, free only
for the poor indigent.

But that never has been used to say

11

that the State can violate an express provision of the Bill
of Rights where indigents are involved, when it cannot violate
it where the well-to-do are involved»
So, it seems to me that the first — the unanimous
decision of the court below is entirely correct, that it is a
violation of the Establishment Clause for the State to provide
funds for the maintenance and repair of schools which are used
in part, at least, for religious education and religious
worship*
Now, the only case that can remotely justify this
statute, and very remotely, is the Everson case in which the
Court upheld the constitutionality of paying, reimbursing
parents for the expenses of sending their children on the
public bus to parochial schools,
Mr. Justice Black, for a majority of the Court,
stated that the purpose of this law is to protect the children
from the hazards of the road.
Now, we do not deny, we cannot deny because of the
prior decisions of this Court would seem to take the position
that you cannot go behind what the Legislature states in its
declaration of purposes.

Therefore, we must assume that the

purposes of this statute are secular,
But the effects are entirely differant.
teach religion or practice religion on the bus.

You do not
If you did,

in a privately owned bus — in Everson it was a publicly owned

12

bus system, where simply the parents got paid back for the
money which they paid for transportation on the public one,
But if you did, under McCollum v, Board of .Education, and you're
going way back to 1948, which held that no premises publicly
owned, publicly financed, can be used for religious teaching
or religious worship, even for as much as a half“hour or an
hour a week»
If it does that, it's unconstitutional, that's what
the Court held in McCollum; and of course it held the same
thing in Engel v, Vitale, the prayer case, in ftbingbon Township
involving Bible reading, and in Lemon v, Kurtzrrtan,
So we believe that this part of the statute, Part 1,
was quite properly held unconstitutional by unanimous vote
of the district court*
Part 2 deals with tuition payments.
In fact, it provides that up to 50 percent of the
tuition of —no, I believe — it does have that, but the
basic provision is that $50 is paid per child for the tuition
up to, or no more them the tuition actually is; for the
tuition paid for enrollment in nonpublic schools.
The question of tuition grants is not a new one,
unlike the maintenance and repair and tax credits, which are
quite new, which appear to be very recent; tuition grants as
a means of avoiding constitutional limitations goes back at
least a century*

13

It has been challenged in the courts in three
different contexts?

first, as a violation of State

constitutional provisions against financing parochial schools,»
second, under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?
and, third, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment in a racial segregation context, and the decisions
growing out of State appropriations of public funds to pay
for the tuition of pupils in racially segregated schools.
How, my own research, and I'm not warranting that
it is exhaustive, indeed, as I will indicate in a moment, I
did overlook one case, fortunately which was supporting ray
position not opposing it.

But the research I have done has

disclosed not a single decision, and there are many, many
which considered the question, not a single decision holding
that there is a constitutional difference between a direct
grant of public funds to religious schools and paying, in whole
or in part, of the tuition of children attending those schools.
The casest some of the cases, there are many others,
supporting my position are in my brief„ both under the State
Constitution, the Establishment Clause, and the Equal Protection
Clause.
In the Establishment Clause cases decided both before
and after the Lemon-DiCenso cases, there were three — I point
out three in my brief; there is actually a fourth which, as I
say, I overlooked, even though I argued the case, but it

14

slipped my memory, I was in the case in the district court»
There were four cases in which the U„ S. District Courts,
in these cases they were three**judge courts, passed upon the
question.
One was Wolman v, Essex in Ohio, which this Court
affirmed without argument? the other is this case? and the
third is the case which will be argued after this one, Lemon v,
Sloan? the fourth, which I did not cite in my brief, as I say,
which slipped my memory, is Lemon v. Sloan where
Brusca v. Missouri.

I mean is

Brusca v, Missouri, where a district

court in Missouri was faced with a challenge by parents of
children in parochial schools to the State Constitution and
the State practice of excluding parochial schools from
governmental

financing.

The parents claimed that this was a violation of
religious freedom and equal protection.
The suit was started before the decision in Lemon v»
Di Censo — Lemon «*QUESTIONS

So that at least the ones I am familiar

with, that is the Ohio case and the Pennsylvania case to be
argued following this group of cases, those provide for
assistance across the board to parents whose children go to
nonpublic schools? this one is directed to impoverished
families, is it not?
MR. PFEFFERs

May I address myself to that

15
QUESTION:

Am I wrong about that?

MR* PFEFFER: Well, I think — technically you are
right and to some extent this is what the State of New York
contends that distinguishes them»

But actually, it's onJ.y

technically right, because Chapter 414 is a single package»
It takes care of children, parents of children with incomes
under $5,000 through a tuition grant.
QUESTIONs Right.
MR. PFEFFER: It takes care of children, of parents of
children with incomes over $5,000 through a tax credit grant.
QUESTIONs

Well, that's Part 3, you haven't got to

that —
MR. PFEFFERj
QUESTIONt

That's Part 3.

Yes.

— you're talking now about Part 2.

MR- PFEFFER: Yes.

But, as I say, this is one single

package, and *—
QUESTION: Well, that's another question in this case,
whether or not it’s severable.
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.

QUESTION: But you haven't come to that yet, either.
I'm just directing myself to Part 2.
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.

Part 2, if it were -- if it were

to be severed from the rest, did apply to parents of children
with incomes not more than $5,000.
QUESTION; And in that respect this case is differant

16

from the other three that you've cited to us, is it not?
MR.. PFEFFER:
three»

That case is different from the other

It is not, however, constitutionally distinguishableP
QUESTION: Well, that's the question„
MR. PFEFFER:

— Mr. Justice, in our position, for

the reason which I state with respect to Part 1.

That, too,

limiting itself as it does to schools in low income areas is
also so purposed and so applied.

But, as I say, it is our

position, it's our position, that there you have, as all the
cases to ever come before this Court, before any court, have
held that you cannot pay the tuition for persons attending
nonpublic schools where either equal protection or, more
specifically in this case, an express prohibition of
Establishment is involved, the fact that it is limited to
one particular class of low income does not justify which
otherwise would be an express prohibition against financing
of religious schools.
QUESTION:

How about the categorical assistance

programs, Mr. Pfeffer?

I'm thinking about AFDC, cooperatively

financed by the State and Federal Gox'ernments, the amount of
the grant to the family with dependent children depends,
generally, upon the number of children.

And what provision,

if any, is made for children in AFDC families that go to
nonpublic schools, do you know?
MR. PFEFFER:

The AFDC payments are payments for

17

poor children, indigent children families which are used by
those families for their —■
QUESTION: Well, I know.

I basically know what the

program is, I asked you —
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

But it's not —•

— what provision is made for children

who go to parochial schools.
MR. PFEFFER:

As far as I know, there is no specific

provision in there for tuition to them.

That is, as far as I

know, and I believe if it were —
QUESTION: Do you know?
MR, PFEFFER:

I do not know, for I believe it would

be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

I don't, either; that's the reason I was

asking.
MR. PFEFFER:

Sure. As far as I know there isn't,

there is no such provision.

It is similar to the G. I. Bill of

Rights, which goes to everybody.

But if it were, if there

were specific grants in there, and I'm fairly confident there
isn't, if there was a specific grant in

there for tuition

to schools, and that tuition was paid to schools which teach
and practice religion, I believe it would be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

What about a grant for, under the G„ I.

program, that included tuition to go to Georgetown Law
School?

18

MR. PFEFFERs

Yes,,

Well,, in the first place, this
*

indeed is pointed out in the various briefs.

This case, this

question and the question asked by Mr. Justice Stewart have
also been considered in many of the cases which I have
referred to, considered and passed.
In respect to the poverty, or indigents, as a matter
of fact, in this very case, a majority of the court pointed
out that the fact that this money in Part 1 goes to indigent
schools, schools in indigent or poverty areas, is almost to
differentiate this from the tax credits, for the unconstitu­
tionality.

It says tax credits are across the board, whereas

the low-income housing

low-income schools are mostly

Catholic schools, therefore a specific religious group is
benefitted, and therefore it's unconstitutional even though
they hold tax credit constitutional,
Now, with respect to —
QUESTION; Well, would your position on that point
be different if, in a particular area that brought the case
to us, if they were 80 percent Lutheran and 20 percent Catholic?
MR. PFEFFER:

Not the least,

QUESTION; Would it make any difference if it was 80
percent private nondenominational and 20 percent -MR. PFEFFERs

Not the least.

I'm just pointing out

the court below was using this argument just the reverse way.
I'm not saying that in every case, in every case which came

19

to the courts, to this Court, Lemon, DiCenso, and to all of
the other courts, the argument has always been, and it's stated
in the declaration of purposes, that without this money from
the government, the poor people wouldn't be able to get an
education.

That's the basis of the argument in every case,

and this.Court didn't deem it, even in DiCenso, the law there
distinguished be tween indigent and nonindigent, poor and non™
poor schools, it provided that the money could only go to those
schools where the cost, the salaries paid to teachers, are
less than the salaries paid in public schools.
That is the poor schools, those which had lower
payments, therefore, that in poor schools where -- and the
arguments are, the argument in this case was that without this
money the poor people won't be able to go to private schools.
QUESTION: Well, that's the whole justification for
welfare programs, particularly the categorical assistance
program for,the AFDC, for dependent children in fatherless
families, isn't it?
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
We had a case here •— what was it —

?

Swab v„ Lennox, unless I have the caption wrong, saying that a
State couldn't cut off aid to a child who is attending an
institution of higher learning.

Now, do you suppose that

case would have gone differently if that institution had been
a parochial institution?

20

MR. PFEFFERs

It might very well have.

QUESTIONS Do you really think so?
MR. PFEFFERs

Except on private, if it goes to

colleges; if it goes to colleges.
QUESTION!

Well, let's assume it's a high school.

MR. PFEFFERs

Yes, indeed, I believe it would.

I believe to that extent it would.
QUESTION:

Do you think the welfare -~

MR. PFEFFERs
QUESTION:

I think that's something —

Because the —

—■ funds have to be set, cut down insofar

as the children of welfare families -—
MR. PFEFFERs
QUESTION:

Well, not necessarily.

—* who go to parochial schools?

MR. PFEFFERs

Not necessarily, because this answers

the question which the Chief Justice raisedB

These moneys go

*

to these parents and they become their funds.

They have a

certain degree of flexibility as to what they use, it's their
money.

Also true with the G. I. Bill,

In World War I, the

G„ I, did not get G, I. benefits as they did in World War II,
they got bonuses, and they used that bonus for whatever
purpose; some of them gave it away to churches, which they
had a right to do, it was their money»

It was paid to them

in compensation for the services which they rendered to this
government.

It was a "no strings attached".

Now, because many of the soldiers used this money

21

unwisely, they set up businesses, they gave it away, they
gambled it away; in World War II it was decided to put strings
attached.
Rights s

It said this, the rationale of the G. I0 Bill of
We have taken a group of American young men away from

their lives, and vje've put them into the Army to serve this
nation; during that period their more fortunate, or other
contemporaries didn't have to do this and could continue their
education in order to make, to earn a livelihood.

They could

go to college, they could go to trade schools, they could
even go

to seminaries to become clergymen and make a living

that way.
Now, when we sent the survivors of the Armed Forces
back, they had lost three or four or five years of their
preparatory years, and instead of giving them unrestricted
money as in World War I, because of the unfortunate experience
there, we're going to say you've got to use this money to
give you some possibility of making up in earning a livelihood,
and it was to be "only for preparation to earn a livelihood",
to give you some money for that purpose.
And you might even argue that it would have been an
unconstitutional violation of religious liberty if the States,
if the government said "any livelihood you want except being
a clergyman".

I'm not arguing that one way or the other, it's

not necessary.
But that was v/hat was in the C,e I, Bill of Rights.

22

QUESTION; Well, that's the rationale, but how in the
world does that affect your First Amendment argument?
MR. PFEFFERs

Because the money was used by them for

any purpose, itas their money.
QUESTION:

But in fact it was used for many of them

to go to religious institutions of learning, was it not?
MR. PFEFFER:

In this case, in this case the money

could only be used for that purpose, unless they coxae up,
unless the parent comes with a receipted bill from a private
school, as the record shows, the brief shows, 95 percent of
the schools in New York which are private are religious
schools.
So, for all practical purposes, it means a religious
school.
QUESTION;

But in this case you can come with a

receipted bill from a private, nondenominationa.1 school?
MR. PFEFFER;

Yes.

Yes.

There are about four

percent of the schools, and I don't think that token could
really save the — it didn't in Lemon against -— it didn't in
the Lemon case, it didn't in DiCenso, it didn't in Wolman case,
in the two Essex cases, which one has already been affirmed
without opinion, it isn't in any of those cases, in all those
cases? no case that I know of.
QUESTION;

Since you again emphasize those

percentages, what would be the situation in your

view if they

23
were reversed, 96 percent private secular schools and 4 percent
private sectarian schools?
MR, PFEFFER: Well, if the money went for tuition,
I don't believe it would be constitutionally distinct,
QUESTIONS As to the —
MR, PFEFFERs Because it still, it's still money for
tuition.

It isn't a —
QUESTION:

Well, then these percentages aren't of

any relevance, are they?
MR. PFEFFER: They're relevant mostly for the third
point, and it was pointed out by this Court in Your Honor's
opinion in both Lemon and DiCenso, that —- and in Walz, too,
Your Honor's opinion in Walz ~ that these statutes are all
directed to practically one religious group.

I am just relying

on what Your Honor said in those cases.
QUESTION:

Well, in Walz —

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

It was —
In the Walz case it wasn't directed

to one religious group.
MR. PFEFFER: That's why it was upheld in that.
why Your Honor upheld it.

The Walz decision.

That's

Because of that,

as the Court pointed out, as you pointed out, that it is not
directed at one religious group, and that's how you get around
to distinguish.
QUESTION: But we didn't concern ourselves with trying

24
to weigh and measure the proportions,, well, then, why should
we here?
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, you —

QUESTION: Whether it's 96/4 or 4/96.
MR, PFEFFER:

Well, in respect to what the Court

pointed out, both in Lemon and DiCenso, the division of the
community on religious lines and the entanglement involved
in — political entanglement in bringing in this issue in
political areas,

Nov/, this was one of the things which the

Establishment Clause was intended to prohibit.
And in Walz, . it was relevant towards constitutionality, it
was relevant in Lemon and DiCenso towards unconstitutionality;
and I suggest that it's relevant here towards unconstitutional!
as well.
This is not created by me out of thin air,

It was

brought in by two decisions.
QUESTION:

Well, what?

I don’t understand.

That a

majority are Roman Catholic, or that a majority are religious?
And of course, in Walz they were all religious by
definition; that’s what the case was about,
MR, PFEFFER:

Yes,

'And therefore — yes,

I just add that I believe that even if they were all
religious, of all religions, as I think the Court, this Court,
in Everson and McCollum, in the Sunday law cases, in Watkins,
forbade aiding one religion over all religions, and it made no

25

distinction.

And I think it would be unconstitutional whether

it was one religion or all religions.
QUESTION: Then I don't understand how you can concede
the constitutionality of the payments made under the G. I,
Bill of Rights after World War II.
MR. PFEFFER:

The answer, I say, Your Honor, is that

this was not even restricted to religion; this was unlimited -QUESTION:

Oh, we know, but a lot of that money

went to aid religious institutions.
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, indeed.

Did it not?

MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.

Just as the bus transportation

went to religious and non-religious schools.

That's true.

But there was no money paid for tuition —
QUESTION:

Directly to the schools, nor is there

here.
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, no.

There is not here, in the

sense that there was — it's not paid directly, but there is
here, in the sense that the money is paid only if you pay
tuition in the religious schools.

It's only if you pay

tuition in —
QUESTION:

No, it's if you pay tuition to private

schools.
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION;

Yes,

Private schools, —

Nonpublic schools.

No, well, it did ~ it did not

originally, but it do go through the hands of the recipients
afterwards.
QUESTION; Well, it certainly didn't when I was under
the G. I. Bill, which was for some four or five years,» the
tuition check simply went to the school.
♦

MR, PFEFFERs

That was changed afterwards; the

question was brought before Congress, and they realized that
there was a constitutional problem there, and thereafter
they changed the law, so that the tuition went directly to
the G.I* and not to the —

Only for tuition.

He could use it

only for tuition, but for tuition in any college, public
college or private college.
QUESTION;

Including -- yes, well, including

or

a trade school.
MR. PFEPFER;
QUESTION:

Yes.

If he hadn't finished high school.

MR. PFEFFER: That's right, he could use it for any
*— any college.
But in respect to tuition limited specifically —
limited specifically, except for four percent — for four
percent, which I believe is tokenism, and I don't believe
could purify the other 96 percent.

Limited specifically

to religious schools, in 96 percent of the cases.

I do not

believe that could be upheld under any law.
QUESTION:

Now, did they not, under the G„ I. Bill,

have some process of inspection and certification after a
period when there were some fraudulent schools, spurious
operations, did they not then establish regulations under the
statute which required the school to meet a particular
standard, so that the government checked on whether this money
was being used wisely in that respect?
MR. PFEFFER:

If the — Mr. Chief Justice, if the

then inspection, those standards, involved surveillance of
the schools, in the sense which Lemon and DiCenso followed,
I believe that could not be upheld under Lemon and DiCenso

Because — it's not found

The Court said —

of all nonpublic schools.
MR. PFEFFER:

MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.
That's not constitutionally objectionable»
That's not constitutionally objec­

tionable, but, on the other hand, that fact does not, at least,
/*

unless this Court overrules Lemon and DiCenso, that fact is
not found to immunise the use of public funds for religious ~ -

29

for schools which would teach both religion and secular
subjects»

That's what the Court held in Lemon and PiCenso»

And the Court, indeed, as recently as last year, in Wisconsin
v, Yoder, this Court repeated that statement? the Court
repeated it, and I should like to just quote what the Court
said, as recently as last year in Wisconsin vc Yoder„

It's

found on page 14 of my briefs
"Long before there was general acknowledgement of
the need for universal formal education, the Religion Clauses
had specifically and firmly fixed the right to free exercise
of religious believes, and buttressing this fundamental right
was an equally firm, even if less explicit, prohibition against
the establishment of any religion by government»

The values

underlying these two provisions relating to religion have
been zealously protected, sometimes even at the expense of
other interests of admittedly high social importance»

The

invalidation of financial aid to parochial schools by
government grants for a salary subsidy for teachers is but
one example of the extent to which courts have gone in this
J '

regard, notwithstanding that such aid programs were legislatively
determined to be in the public interest and the service of
sound educational policy by States and by Congress»"
Lemon v, Kurtzman, Tilton v,

Citing

Richardson, Everson v. Board of

Education»
Then the facts in those cases are no different than

30

the facts in this case-

As I — and if no different in any

of the cases, the four District Court cases, including the
one which, Brusca v~ Missouri, which I have not cited? all
those cases, there were twelve judges, four from the Court of
Appeals and eight from the District Court, deciding on tuition
grants.

Not one, not one of those judges held that tuition

grants is constitutional»
QUESTION:

You didn't, I think, give us the citation

of your Missouri case, uncited in your brief.
MR» PFEFFER:

Yes»

332 F» Supp. 275, affirmed 405

U»S. 1050, affirmed last year, in 1972»
Now, let me read —
QUESTION: Would you repeat that last cite again?
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

405 U»S. 1050, 1972»

Yes»

MR„ PFEFFER:

Let me say, for a moment, what the

Court held in the Brusca case»

This was the — the Lemon-

Pi Censo case was decided after this suit was started, and the
Court in that respect says:
Faced with this decision, plaintiffs now argue
that some alternative programs, such as tuition grants, could
constitutionally be devised which, sc they contend, would be
free of government entanglement.
The Court rejected that and it said
want to read it now because of time — it said:

and I don't
Lemon violates

31

that.

Three judges —
QUESTION:

Isn’t that parochial parents’ action —

MR., PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

—* to require the State to

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

That's a somewhat different context

MR. PFEFFER:

No, it is — this is —- well, it’s

somewhere between dictum and holding.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PFEFFER:

But the Court said — the Court said

that this would be unconstitutional under Lemon.

I will

repeat it to you:
Wholly apart from the fact that entanglement
comparable to that described in Lemon cannot be realistically
avoided, if plaintiffs are granted aid for parochial school
purposes, particularly on a continuing basis, it's selfevident that both the purpose and effect of any statute giving
tax-raised funds to assist parents in the free exercise of
religion would necessarily be to support religion.
So that we have twelve, twelve Federal Court judges,
not one of them finding any distinction, and none of the State
Courts, as cited in Walz, both in this context and in the
equal protection, racial subjects? not one of them finding
any distinction between a direct grant and tuition.
Now, I must devote the rest of my time —> unfortun-

32

ately, I have not been able to go to it.

But I must speak

about the third part, the tax credit part, which, indeed, is
the most important, because that seems to be which way the
wind is blowing„
Now, I concede if tuition grants are held by this
Court to be constitutionally permissible, then tax credits
are constitutionally permissible,

Now --

QUESTION: Do you think the reverse of that is true,
also?
MR. PFEFFER:
true.

Yes.

I think the reverse of that is

I think the reverse of that
The reason for that is because tax credits is merely

one form of paying for tuition.

Now, we're not speaking about

tax deductions, I'm not speaking — that's not before this
Court —
QUESTION:
MR. PFEFFER:

Tax exemptions?
Well, certainly not tax exemptions.

We're not speaking of tax exemptions nor tax deductions.
Suppose ~
t

QUESTION:

Do you think there is a difference, Mr.

Pfeffer?

Between exemptions or between

yes, would a tax deduction make it be a different case?

Mr. Pfeffer, you have

about 15 minutes of your time left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.,
i

ON BEHALF OF COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION
AMD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, ET AL.
MR. PFEFFER:

- [Resumed]

I just wanted to complete my answer,

then 1*11 reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
The District Court in Ohio, the case cited in

the

Kosydar case, and Professor Freund, among others, are of the
opinion that there is no difference between tax credits and
tax deductions, as they are equally unconstitutional*
I am inclined to think that a fairly good case could
be made of constitutionality of tax deductions for tuition
paid to parochial schools»

I think there was a wall of

difference between credits and deductions, for reasons which
I don't want to — which I state in my brief and which are
stated by the court below, Judge Gurfein, in his opinion,
stated the reasons why there's a difference between tax
deductions and tax credits8
But I think a good, a reasonable argument could be
made that if a payment for tuition to parochial schools were
treated as a contribution to the parochial schools, in other
words it would be deductible to that amount and to no more,

35

and treated like contributions to a church, which are tax
exempt, or to
QUESTION s

Or medical deductions for

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Or medical deductions

~ for service to you in a Catholic

hospital*
MR* PFEFFER:

Anything.

If it were treated as a

deduction.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. PFEFFER:

Then I think that a reasonable argument

could be made for it, that it's constitutional.
I know that, as I say, the court disagrees with me,
and I of course respect his preeminence in the field of
constitutional law? but I believe it can be made.
But where the, as in this statute, you simply
reduce the tax liability by a certain amount, and instead of
paying the government what you owe it, you would reduce the
amount which is set forth, which is determined by the
statute, and it has nothing to do with how much you deduct,
how much your tuition is, it depends upon your income status.
And I can see no difference between a situation
where you owe the government X dollars for taxes, and you pay
the government that amount, and the government sends you an
independent check for tuition which you owe, which you pay to
a parochial school.

I see no constitutional difference between

36

that situation and the situation where, instead of paying the
government itfhat you owe them on your income tax, you send
instead

a receipted bill for your tuition, and you deduct that

amount, to make -QUESTION:

Of course, whether it's a credit or

a deduction, neither does any good unless you have income;
unless you have enough income to make it worthwhile.
MR. PFEFFER:

Well, if you don't have, then you get

it under another technique, they'll give you the money in the
form of tuition.
QUESTION:

That's right —

MR* PFEFFER:

Under this statute.

So you get the

money from —
QUESTION:

But a deduction wouldn't do anybody any

good without income.
MR. PFEFFER:

That's right.

That's right.

That’s

no good without income, and therefore in this State, in this
statute they give you the cash in the form of tuition.

In

Ohio and some other States, they give you a negative income
tax, where they pay you the money even though you don't pay it.
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mrs. Coon.

Very well, Mr. Pfeffer,

37

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEAN JL COON,
ON BEHALF OF NYQUIST, ET AL.
MRS. COON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
To freshen the perspective here, we think that the
validity, constitutional validity of the statutes here at
issue revolve not solely around the precise language of the
statute, but the intent and purpose with which the New York
State Legislature enacted them»
The Legislature, in 1972, undertook to meet certain
specific needs of children attending nonpublic schools and
their parents.

It was confronted with a growing clamor for

tax reflief on the part of parents who paid tuition in the
nonpublic schools on behalf of their children, and who also
additionally support public schools in the form of tax
payments»
It was faced with the problem of increasing safety
hazards in nonpublic schools, which particularly in low-income
areas had been unable to meet the cost of maintenance and
repair, essential to health and safety structures»
Further, the State had become increasingly
cognizant of the problem faced by low-income parents in
paying the tuition necessary to the selection of a nonpublic
school education for their children.
And finally, although not directly relevant to this

33
appeal and still part of the same legislative enactment, in
those areas where the financial crisis in the nonpublic
schools had forced their closing, the public schools had been
faced with increased costs of education in general, and
particularly in the cost of additional physical space for
the increasing enrollments.
Consequently, in an attempt to meet or in part to
alleviate what the District Court here indeed recognizes were
basically secular problems.

The Legislature of the State of

New York adopted Chapter 414 of the Laws of 1972«,
I will address myself initially in this argument
to the problem with which Mr. Pfeffer left off, that of the
income tax portion of the legislation„ then to the health and
safety grants, and finally to that portion of the statute
relating to the tuition reimbursement to low-income parents.
The tax portion of this statute provides not for
a tax credit but for a modification of adjusted gross income
for the purposes of New York determining the New York State
income tax payable.
For New York State income tax purposes, the adjusted
gross income is the same on both the Federal and State
returns, with the exception of a number of State modifications.
There are additional modifications of gross income, which are
provided solely in State law qad not under the Federal tax
r-eturn.

39

For example, a deduction is not allowed on the State
return for income tax, Stats income taxes which have been paid,
although it is allowed on the Federal return? and on the State
return an additional modification is allowed for life
insurance premiums paid, although they are not allowed on the
Federal return.
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:

Is there a limit on that?
Yes, there is.

It’s — I don’t remember

what it was this year, but it had been $150? it’s now less
than that»
This Court has indeed recognized that the States have
an inherent power and authority in enacting tax legislation.
The powers of the State to tax its citizens are co-equal with
those of the Federal Government, and are only limited by the
specific limitations on the State's power found in the Federal
Constitution.
QUESTION:
MRS» COON:
QUESTION:

Mrs. Coon, —
Yes?
— are you going to address yourself to

the precise manner in which this New York tax, the portion of
the statute dealing with tax, operates?

It came up, I know,

in questioning during Mr® Pfeffer's argument, as to whether
it's a credit or a deduction or an exclusion.

Are you going

to address yourself to the precise manner in which it operates?
MRS. COON:

Yes, Your Honor, I am

40

We think it is particularly significant here that
in the cases involving the constitutionality of the Federal
income tax law, that this Court upheld the validity in the
face of arguments that there were differences in the classes
of income tax deductions or exemptions that were allowed,
that they were not uniform as to all taxpayers and that some
could claim ones which others could notc
We submit that the New York Legislature, in selecting
and enacting tax legislation, has the power to select what
income to tax, how much of the income it wishes to tax, and
to provide for deductions and exemptions in whatever amount and
for whatever purpose it elects,
QUESTIONS
MRS. COONs

But a credit is different in New York?
A tax credit is different, yes; a tax

credit comes off at the tail end.
QUESTION:

It's just a forgiveness of what you owe

the government, —
MRS, COONs
•

QUESTION!
MRS, COONs

— it’s a setoff„
Right.

QUESTION:

It's like paying you money directly.

MRS, COONs

Now, in this particular instance, this

comes off at the top.
the

Yes.

This is a modification of income for

prior to the determination of the amount of tax owed,

It comes off at the beginning of the tax return; it’s a

41
reduction of the income subject to tax*

We submit that this

is equivalent to, in legal principle, to a deduction or to an
exemption, because it is a thing which reduces your income that
is subject to tax, not a forgiveness of tax owed»
QUESTIONS

But it isn't — if you pay $300 tuition,

under the New York plan you don’t get a $300 deduction from
your income, do you?
MRS» COON:

No, you do not.

QUESTION:

No, you do not.

So it's not a deduction

as that term, at least, is generally understood in tax law:
is it?
MRS„ COON:

No, it is not»

But it also is not a tax credit, as that term is
generally understood, because the tax credit also amounts to a
precise dollar amount»
QUESTION:

Well, a tax credit is just a reduction of

the amount of money you owe the government directly, that’s
what a credit is,
MRS, COON:

Right, that's what a credit is»

And this is not, this is, we submit, equivalent in legal
principle to a deduction or exemption* even though in terms
of the actual mechanism by which it operates it doesn't come
out the same way.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it closer to an exemption

that you get for dependents on. your Federal income tax return?

42
isn't that the closest analogy?
MRS. COON:

Well, it is closest in analogy, because

your exemption is not related to an actual expenditure.
a fixed amount.

It's

So it is closest to an exemption.

QUESTION:

Yes, but that, the exemption comes out

of — it serves to reduce your taxable income? in that
extent, it's like a deductions
MRS« COON:

Yes,

And to that extent this is

precisely the same way? that this does reduce your taxable
income,

This comes off *—
QUESTION:

I thought it was geared to operate to

actually reduce your taxes directly„
MRS, COON:

No, no.

It comes off the top6

QUESTION: Well, maybe you'll explain it, as Justice
Rehnquist suggested in an earlier question,
MRS, COON:

New York State has actually had a

history of tax credits which have not been related to specific
purposes.

They have been a tax credit to single and married

people, which is directed at reducing the tax owed,

It was,

for example, for a single person, $12,50, for a married
couple $25 in the reduction; and up until this past year we
have taken off, as a tax credit off the income tax, after it
has been computed.
QUESTION:
MRS, COON:

This —
And that's a true credit,
Right,

That's a true credit.

43

QUESTIONS

That’s a forgiveness of part of what you

owe in taxes.
MRS. COONs

Yes,

Now, this, on the other hand, the modification of
gross income provision, starts at the top of the income tax
return,

this comes off before you compute your tax liability,

it comes off ~
QUESTION:

You mean like the box that, goes over,

how many exemptions you have, this would be like another box
right there,
MRS, COON:

Yes, except that it's figured slightly

differently, since it's figured differently in amount.

But

it comes off at that part of the tax return, it comes off in
the
QUESTION:

But it is a flat amount?

MRS. COON:

No, it varies based upon income.

QUESTION:

That's right, that's what I ~~

MRS. COON-:

For persons with an income of less than

of $9,000 or less, it’s $1,000? if your income is between,
I think it’s between $20,000 and $23,999, it's $100,

and

above that it’s a zero amount.
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:
QUESTION:
MRS. COON

Yes,

Yes,

So that the —
But it would be up in that level?
Yes,

right

44
QUESTION:

On the return»

MRS. COON:

Yes, it would be up at that point; it's

up in that part of the return, before you start computing
your taxable income and the tax liability»

And to that

extent we say that it operates much the same as a deduction,
or exemption, and probably much closer to an exemption simply
because exemptions themselves are set as fixed amounts which
are unrelated to the purpose for which it’s grantedo
In other words, you’re exempt, your present
exemption under the Federal income tax is $750 ■—
QUESTION: But that’s the same for everybody, be his
income $5,000 or $500.
MRS. COON:

Yes, but it’s also unrelated, it’s

unrelated to the actual expenses necessary to live, for the
beneficiary, for the dependent for whom it's claimed.
QUESTION:

This is a very appropriate day to be

discussing this.
MRS, COON:

Yes.

[Laughter,]
MRS. COON:

Although actually in New York State

we*re entitled to an additional day because the Internal
Revenue District office in Massachusetts has a legal holiday
today.
But an exemption also varies, can be claimed
additionally; there are additional purposes of exemption for

45

persons over 65 or blind# and so forth? so the exemptions do
multiply to some degree not directly related to the number of
persons involved»
But to that extent# because it is also not
directly involved in the question of the actual amount spent#
we say that this is closer to an exemption than to a deduction#
but is a legal principle equivalent to either a deduction or
exemption# rather than a tax credito

Because it relates to

the modification of taxable income prior to the computation
of the tax dues
We submit that the addition of a modification of
gross income# allowable to tuition~paying parents of
children in nonpublic schools# was no more and no less than an
exercise of the State's inherent power to determine the measure
of personal income subject to taxation by the State»
QUESTION *

So one thing — but# in any event# on

the deduction# if it's an exemption or a deduction it has a
differential effect# then, depending on how much money you
make?
MRS. COONs
QUESTION*
MRS. COONs

Yes.
I see.
I should also point out that in the

medical deductions# for example# in the Federal income tax#
there is a difference there, really# as to whether or not
you can claim them# depending upon your income? the higher your

46

income is, the less likely you are to ever get a medical
deduction on the Federal income tax»
QUESTIONS
MRS» COONs

Yes»
This initial portion of the statute,

we submit, is not only simply an exercise of the State's power
of taxation, but also meets the secular purpose and effect
test which was set forth by this Court in the Schempp case »
The purpose of this statute, as was specifically
found by the district court, was to provide tax relief to
tuition-paying parents of children in nonpublic schools»
It was not to provide aid to the schools themselves»
The primary effect, also as found by the district
court, would not be a benefit to the nonpublic schools but
rather to the tuition-paying parent.
The court recognized the fact that by the time the
parent's income tax liability is fixed and determined and he
files his return, the tuition has long since been paid»

And

that any benefit he gets out of this reduction, and the
eventual reduction in the tax which would most likely be
pocketed by him and used for his own personal purposes
rather than turned over to the school.
That it is chronologically unrelated to the time of
paying tuition, and therefore not be considered to be using
the parent here as a conduit to paying money to the schools.
Without payment to the schools or any contact with

47
the schools attended by the parent *— incidentally, on the
New York State income tax return, in claiming the modification
of gross income, a parent is not required to state what school
he sent the child to.

He simply adds this in as an item off

of his return, and only if he is subsequently audited would
there be any question raised, would he ever have to prove to
what school the money was paid.
QUESTION:

Is there anywhere in these papers a

i

tax form that shows us how this works out?
MRS. COON;

No.

I can get you one, there might be

someone in the Court who might, but — all right.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
all of us.

It would be helpful to

I suggest, with copies to your friends, that if

you would submit some illustrations as to just how that works,
it might be helpful.
MRS. COON:

Okay.

I know I have them at home.

Now, without payment to the schools or with any
contact with the schools attended by the children, we submit
that there can be no entanglement between government and
religion, let alone excessive entanglement.
The provision of tax relief to parents can in no
way be construed as an unconstitutional aid to religion.
There is here no First Amendment violation and the district
court’s judgment on that should be affirmed.
As to Section 1 of the —

48

QUESTION;

Now, is this a choice a person makes

between getting a tax benefit or getting the tuition grant?
HRS„ COON;
$5,GOO-

Mo, only if his income is less than

Then he would have to make the choice»
And the purpose of that, of course, is simply to see

that they don't get a double benefit.

QUESTION:

But yo\ir deduction, your deduction or

exemption, whatever you call it, or credit, whatever you call
it, doesn't go progressively down up to 24, does

it?

Or does

it —
MRS. COON:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does, it goes progressively down,
It goes progressively down and then ends

at 24.
MRS. COON:

Yes.

QUESTION: Right.
MRS. COON:

That apparently assumes that if your

income is over $24,000 you can afford to send your children to

50

nonpublic schools without needing any tax relief.

I am sure

there are parents who would disagree with that, but that was
the legislative philosophy behind it.
Getting to Section 1 of the statute, the so-called
health and safety grants, the Legislature specifically found
that the financial crisis of nonpublic schools in low-income
areas would result in deferred maintenance and repair programs,
and it had also resulted in an increase in health and safety
hazards to the children attending those schools.
Here, too, the district court in this case found
that the conditions and problems set forth in the legislative
findings were valid, and expressed a secular legislative
intent.
The bill provides, as Mr, Pfeffer said, for
specific dollar amounts per pupil, with an additional dollar
amount for pupils attending schools in buildings constructed
prior to 1947, and would be paid to the schools as a partial
reimbursement for prior expenditures for repairs and
maintenance„
The expenditure of the money, we submit, is safe­
guarded in two wayss

first, the amount may not exceed 50

percent of the statewide average cost of maintenance and
repair in the public schools; and may not exceed the actual
amount paid by the nonpublic school in the preceding base
year

51

Further, not all nonpublic schools will qualify for
grants under this program.,

Only those schools will qualify

which have been certified as serving a high concentration of
low-income pupils for the purposes of Title 4 of the
Federal Higher Education Act of 1965»
Title 4 involves the specific grants to teachers who
agree to teach in — for educational purposes, for persons
in educational institutions who are preparing for teaching,
who agree to teach in low-income areas.
The schools involved in this will be approximately —
approximate some 250 out of the 1400 nonpublic schools in the
State of New York,
In perspective, we must observe that this Court has
never held that all direct payments to nonpublic schools are
unconstitutional.

And we must also state that there is a

long tradition of Federal as well as State aid to the nonpublic
schools in the form of special benefits and direct payments
to either the schools or their students,

I use as an example

the school lunch program, tax exemptions, the G, I, Bill of
Rights, and the programs and benefits under the Federal
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,
We cite many other instances in our brief on this
appeal.
It must be assumed that the payments and benefits so
provided have been considered not to aid religion but rather

52

to have some other public and secular purpose.
The statute here at issue, we submit, was adopted
in the exercise of the State's police power, to protect the
health and safety of children of the State,
Contrary to the argument of Mr, Pfeffer's seemed to
advance, we do not consider and we do not believe that the
Court's decisions have ever considered that the police power
was directly related to what we normally consider as crime
policing*
The police power has had its purpose and activity
in various fields of health and safety, far beyond the normal
criminal justice system.
The latitude which has been ascribed to the police
power by the courts is very great.

This Court has indeed

held that the State has a sovereign right to protect the
welfare of its people, and while most of the cases cited in
our brief relate to regulatory statute adopted as an exercise
of the police power, we submit that there is no essential
legal or constitutional difference between statutes which
regulate and statutes which provide money to accomplish the
desired police power purpose*
In fact, the Everson case, as Mr, Pfeffer stated,
we submit, supports this.

Because this Court, in Everson,

upheld bus transportation on the basis that as a police power
measure is designed to get children safely to nonpublic

53
schools* to protect them from the hazards of, as this Court
said, either hitchhiking or walking on highways,
QUESTION:

Well, that really doesn't answer your

problem here, though, does it?

I mean, if it's a valid

exercise of the police power, that means you've got to first
conclude it doesn't violate the First Amendment»

And if it

doesn't violate the First Amendment, it is a valid exercise
of the police power,
MRS„ COON:
statement,

Well, yes, Your Honor, that’s a correct

I would think it does not violate the First

Amendment,
QUESTION: But to say it's the police power, I don't
see how that really advances your argument,
MRS, COON:

Well, I think, in this respect:

this

was the purpose of the statute, it was a police power statute.
It had a — it was not intended to benefit religious schools,
it was not intended to benefit religion, it was not intended to
benefit the schools essentially as institutions.

It was

intended, as an exercise of the police power, to protect the
health and safety of the children, the State's citizen children
who were attending these nonpublic schools,
QUESTION:

Well, as Justice Rehnquist said, it might

be a perfectly valid exercise of the State's reserva power, or
police power, that power compendiously known as the police
power, so far as the Due Process Clause goes, or something like

54

r

that,, but that doesn't* that begs the question of whether or
not it violates the First Amendment, doesn't it?

The First

and Fourteenth .Amendments *
MRS* COON:

No, I think this is — this is what we

get to from there*
QUESTION; Well, let's pursue that for a moment*
It might be perfectly valid, as applied to a secular school,
a private, nondenominational school, and I take it Mr* Pfeffer
would not question that, if the State decided to make grants*
It runs afoul of the First Amendment, as Justice Stewart and
Justice Rehnquist suggested, if it runs afoul, as soon as you
introduce this other element*
MRS* COON:

Well, we advance the police power

argument, I think, as a — to demonstrate the secular intent
of the legislative purpose of this*

Contrary to Mr* Pfeffer's

argument, we do not see, in the language of the First
Amendment, a direct prohibition against aid to parochial
schools*
QUESTION: Well, what if, for example, Mrs. Coon,
the school was, the building was condemned, it was in such a
bad state of repair, it was condemned because it was hazardous
to the health, the safety of the stairways, it was a fire
hazard, and a lot of other things; in your view, could the
State of New York contribute the money to build a new
building under the exercise of its police power?

55

MRS» COON;

I would think that they could at least

contribute the money to rehabilitate the structure.

The

State does this now, not. in the ~
QUESTION; Well, that's this —
MRS„ COONs
QUESTION;

Not in terms of facilities»
That's this case* but I'm speaking now

of a new building? could they say, we now condemn it, we tear
it down, we're going to put up a new building, and we, the
State of New York, will pay for it„

Do you think they could

do that?
MRS, COONs

No, I don't think we go — I don't think

it goes that far, because what we're saying here is that we’re
trying to protect the safety of children in the buildings
they attend»
Now, if the building were in such a case that it had
to be condemned, to be torn down, it could not be rehabilitated?
to that extent, then, there is no question of the safety of the
children in the building in which they're attending.

That

would be a — that's a different questionc
QUESTION;

Well, suppose they found a seminary that

was — all the seminaries were in complete need of rehabilita­
tion,

The same findings that they made here as to the

elementary and high schools.

Would you say the State could

contribute toward that?
MRS, COON;

I would think no,

I think that the

56
difference, the difference is one of the State's interests
in protecting children who are, for whom the State acts in a
different plane than certainly from the adults x^ho would be
going there.
QUESTION;

Suppose they found that all of the

church schools were in need of rehabilitation, where all they
taught was religion; would that be all right?
MRS, COON:

Where all they taught was religion?

QUESTION;

Yes.

MRSe COON;

I would think no, because we’re talking

here about —
QUESTION;

So that the First Amendment does limit

the police power.
MRS, COON:

Well, it limits the police power, because,

in that extent, I suppose we would say that the money would be
going directly to the aid of religion, if all the school
taught was religion»
Here we’re talking about schools which meet the

QUESTION:

Well, don’t let me get to the half and

half, 40/60 now; don’t let me get to that,
MRS, COON;

No, I don’t think we get into that; I

don’t think it is half and half or 40/60? I think it’s a
question of what the State is doing is relating to the
children who attend schools which meet the requirements of a
secular education, for whom the State takes this interest,

57
for whom the State has this interest in ~ relating to their
education.
QUE£5TlQNs

Well, on the interest of the Stats in

supervising the private schools, what does the State's reason
for that, other than the enforcement of its compulsory
attendance lav/?

What other reason does the State have to

supervise these schools?
MRS. COON:

I think that's the sole reason.

It's

the enforcement of the compulsory attendance laws, and the
compulsory attendance law does more than just say whether the
student goes to school on a particular day.
QUESTION:

That's right.

And that's the State's

Precisely,

In this case the State's

only interest.
MRS. COONs

interest is that these students have a right to go to these
nonpublic schools for the purpose of complying with this
compulsory education 1 aw, for the purpose of attending these
nonpublie schools, for the purpose of getting a secular
education.

To that extent, that the State has the, not only

the power of supervision of the schools but also the right to
get into the issue of the health and safety of the structures
which they attend.
To tills extent, we say that this is a

that the

primary intent and effect of the statute was not aid to
religion, did not violate the First Amendment, that it did,

58

in the health and safety grants also complies with the
constitutional mandate in the intent of the First Amendment„
Briefly,, I should like to mention the tuition
reimbursement portion of the statute.
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:

It is --

That’s Part 2, isn’t it?
Pardon me — that's Part 2 or Section

2 of the statute, yes.
First of all, that the tuition reimbursement provides
for a payment to low-income parents of the lesser of two
amounts, either 50 percent of the tuition paid to the nonpublic
school or $50 per child per year in elementary school or
$100 in secondary schools? the lesser of those two amounts.
We say that this is equivalent to the — to those
other public measures which enable parents, in which the
State participates in the assistance of low-income or
indigent parents, or indigent persons.
Before lunch, Justice Stewart asked the question
concerning the ADC payments.

New York State, as the Court

may be aware, has the flat grant system of payment to the
ADC, to welfare recipients? but prior to that time, prior to
the time that the flat grant system was introduced, where
there were categorical grants for various things, such as
rent, heat, food allowances, clothing allowances, and so
forth, the State Education Law required payments for the
educational expenses of children, and this was interpreted

53
to include not only tuition to nonpublic schools but also the
expenses of books, clothes, which would include uniforms for
nonpublic schools, educational supplies, and so forth.
So that prior, and since the flat grant deduction,
the pressure increased upon the Legislature for the benefit
of the low-incoma parents, directly related to the fact that
they no longer were getting this assistance which they had in
the past for the purpose of tuition reimbursement as well as
other expenses of children attending nonpublic schools.
Along with that, and there has been an additional
feeling within the Legislature that since low-income parents
as well as upper-income parents have a constitutional right to
send their children to nonpublic schools, that they should not
be deprived of this right solely because of their lack of
income B
We have equated this to some degree with the welfare
system, with the provision of low-income housing, with the
State’s provision of certain benefits in the way of transcripts
of administratiine hearings, and so forth, to persons who have
low income or who are poverty-stricken.
To this extent, we submit that the low income portion
of the statute was itself intended not to benefit the schools,
it is paid to the parents long after the tuition has been
paid, it is not — they are not used as a conduit for the pay­
ment to the schools.

There is here no direct aid to the

60

schools, and the only indirect aid results from the fact that
the attendance at nonpublic schools may be made easier for
some children? a benefit which this Court has held does not
constitute an unconstitutional aid to religion in and of
itself.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Coon, under the New York system of

government, does there have to be an appropriation for this
periodically, or once the law is enacted does it just
automatically
MRS, COON:

No, there would have to be an

appropriation periodically.

All moneys to be paid out of the

State treasury are subject to appropriation.
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:
QUESTION:

What, bi-annually or annually?
Annually.
Annually?
Annually.
Yes.

So that this law is self-executing

from the point of view of its financing?
MRS. COON:

No, it is not; no, it is not.

By the

effect of the State constitutional provision which prohibits
any payment out of the State .treasury unless there is a
specific appropriation for that payment.
QUESTION:
MRS. COON:
QUESTION:

An annual appropriation?
Yes.
Mrs. Coon, is there any limitation on the

61

kind of a parochial school that could benefit under this New
York statute?
MRS * COON s

Yes, to this extents

the school must

of course comply with the State's compulsory education law?
it may not discriminate on the basis of race? it may not
discriminate on the basis of religion, except as to its own
— if it is a religiously oriented school, as to its own
religious denomination»

In other words, if a Catholic

school determines to accept non-Catholic, any non-Gatholics,
it could not discriminate between groups of non-Catholics,
So there is that limitation.
QUESTIONi

But yet it may still benefit in the

program, even though it limits its admissions to Catholics?
MRS» COON:
QUESTION:

Yes, as to persons of its own religion„
And even though one of the requirements

of going to this school is that you study religion?
MRS, COON:

Yes, that would be true.

It's not

something that the statute looks at; the statute is — the
statutory enactment is not concerned with those requirements
of the school.
QUESTION; Right,
MRS. COON:

But it would, if that is the type of

school to which the parent determines to send a child, as to
be permissible.

The only prohibition is against racial

discrimination.

And then, as I said, discrimination between

62

religions other than what they have at the school*
We have covered, I think, the issue of severability
of this statute in our brief, and I will leave that part of
the argument to that»
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PORTER R3 CHANDLER, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS CHERRY, ET AL.,
AND APPELLEES BOYLAN, ET AL,
MR„ CHANDLER:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I am here representing two groups of parents, one
are parents with taxable incomes of less than $5,000, who are
eligible for tuition refund under Section 2 of the Act? the
other group of parents have adjusted gross incomes of less
than $25,000 and are eligible for the tax modification
provided in Sections 3 through 5 of the Aat.
The emphasis that I want to make from the start is
that this statute is aimed to help parents, not schools, and
that we represent parents who are directly affected.
Now, what kind of figures are we talking about?
I realize, from questions this morning, that the percentage
of one or the other is not of particular importance.

But

we're talking now about the children in New York State who

63

go to nonpublic schools, and. there are about 750,000 of them,
as compared to about 3,2 million in public schools»
The 750,000 nonpublic school children attend schools
of all categories, the only requirement of the school is that
it should give satisfactory education in secular subjects,
and that it should not discriminate on race and so on, as
indicated in what Mrs» Coon just said»
QUESTION:

I gather it can't be a profit-making

school?
MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

A profit-making school.

MR. CHANDLER:
right, Your Honor.

It can’t be a what, sir?

It can't be profit-making, you're

A nonprofit school that comes within the

requirements of the compulsory education law.
There are a total of something around 2,000 such
schools in New York State, and the figures roughly are that
are 1400

of them are affiliated with the Catholic Church,

300 or a little more are affiliated with, I think, some
dozen or more other religious bodies, the largest one next to
the Catholic is the Jewish schooly and about 300 more are
non-religiously affiliated.

A total of about 2,000 and

accounting for 750,000 children.
While I'm on the subject, which has been injected
again and again, in some of these cases, I want to correct
certain misapprehensions as to what the Catholic school, at

64

least, is or is not*

It is not a school for rich or medium

well™to-do, it is increasingly becoming a school of the poor
and of the minority races.

The figures show that in New York

City alone there are 70,000 families with children in Catholic
schools who have incomes at or near the poverty level.
The figures show that Catholic elementary schools
in the Bronx and Manhattan have 31,000 non-white children
attending, out of 65,000 total.

More than 60 percent of

the children in Catholic schools in Manhattan are black or
Spanish-speaking? over 30 percent in the Bronx.
QUESTION;

That would be, as a matter of just fact,

that would be largely the Puerto Rican community, would it?
MR. CHANDLER;

Largely Puerto Rican.

Well, New

York has a rather large Spanish, other than Puerto Rican,
community.

If you lump the rest of Latin America and from

Spain itself, yes, the others would be primarily Puerto
Rican.
Now,, the statute comes before you with very strong
legislative findings as to each of the sections involved,
and the statute recognizes the burdens that are now being borne
by parents who send children to accredited nonpublic schools
and relieve the State of that tax burden, under Sections 2 to
5

.
Concentrating first on the tuition reimbursement,

the requirements for admission to that ballpark are that you

65

should have an income of less than 25 — of taxable income
of less than $5,0002 that you should have children in a nonpublic school; and that you shall have paid tuition for having
them there.

And the tuition, as Mrs, Coon pointed out, the

tuition that is ultimately reimbursable can in no case
exceed half what was actually paid; it*s half what was
actually paid, or $50 per annum for elementary school pupils,
$100 per annum for high school pupils,
I mention that because, with all respect, I think
Mr, Pfeffer misquoted it this morning; he said that you could
get up to the full amount of tuition, which you can’t.
On the tax reimbursable — on the tuition reimbursable
provision, the trial court found that there was a good secular
legislative purpose, and the effect is actually, we submit,
neither to advance nor to inhibit religion.

It's to nurture

a pluralistic society, to see that all segments of the society
have a right to mature and develop and be adequately
represented.
New York, with its tradition of over 200 years of a
single system of education, both public and private, under
the Board of Regents, has always laid stress on promoting
plurality and diversity.

And the refund, as I have emphasized,

is for the benefit of parents, it goes to parents only*
is no question of a conduit here.

There

The parent has his child

in a school, to get him in he has to pay tuition at the

66

beginning of the year? he pays it, and he's parted with that
money*

Some months later, after he's filled out the necessary

forms, he gets back from the State a check representing a
small fraction of what he may have paid to the school*

He

doesn't ~~ that's his money, he's already paid the school,
there is no connection between the two of them, it is perfectly
open to that parent to say, I don't like this shool any
longer, I won't bring my child back next year, I'll take him
out*
And it's all right for him to say, I've got $50 here
from the State, it's a windfall, I'll go spend it at the
races*

Or if he's feeling more charitable, he will say to

his wife, In view of the price of steaks, I'm going to give
you this money, you can go downtown and buy a good, nice
steak to celebrate with.
In the session this morning —
QUESTIONt

You of course recognize that he knew

about that when he paid the money to the school?
MR. CHANDLER! That he knew that the°money was coming?
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

Of course,
Yes, yes, that's right,

I mean I don't want to take advantage

of your argument, but I think you ought to —
MR* CHANDLER:
company in

in --

Just as the parent who paid the bus

67
QUESTION s

Everson»

MR- CHANDLER?

— Eversonhe knew he was going to

get it back.
QUESTIONS Sure.
MR- CHANDLERS

But when he got it back, it was his

money, I think, Your Honor.
There was discussion this morning of the G. I- Bill
of Rights as an example of this tuition business-

We have

listed in our brief various other, similar items, such as the
Regent's scholarships and the scholar incentive programs in
New York State; and I shan't develop those further.
As to entanglement, this tuition refund requires a
minimum of entanglement.

There must be a verification that

the children are actually enrolled at schools, no entanglement
there; the verification that tuition has been paid; and a
verification that the individual in question is not telling
different stories to the people whom he is asking for the tax
refund and the tax authority-

In other words, if he says he

has an income of $,972, they will check with the Federal Tax
Commission — the State Tax Commission, to see if that is
right.
Turning now, in the very brief moments left, to the
tax relief business-

We have discussed in our brief the

question of tax credit versus tax exclusion versus tax
deduction and so on-

A typical tax credit is the $12o50 that

68

every New York resident is entitled to take off of his income
tax after he has figured it all — he figures it all out, and
he figures that he has to owe $483,97? and then, just for
being a taxpayer, he's allowed a flat cancellation of $12,50
of that money, whether he's a millionaire or whether he's a
pauper.

That's an example of a tax credit.
Tax exemption, I think the best example is what

Your Honors held in Walz, namely a particular person or
institution that just doesn't have to pay any taxes, or
doesn't have to pay a particular category of taxes.
This is just what the statute describes it, a tax
modification; and it comes off, as Mr, Justice Stewart
observed, it comes off the top rather than at the bottom.
Section 5 comes to the Court with this legislative,
strong legislative finding, which I'm going to reads
Such educational institutions — and that refers to
all of the institutions covered by the Act, religious and
non-religious — Such educational institutions not only
provide education for the children attending them, but by
their existence relieve the taxpayers of the State of the
burden of providing public school education for those
children.
That finding was adopted almost
in the district court.
As with the tuition reimbursement, I emphasise that

69

this is only partial relief, the beneficiary is the parent
and not the school-

There is no grant from the treasury#

There is a secular intent, namely equity#

And the benefit is

net to the — if any, to religious schools is so remote as
not to involve impermissible entanglement#

And there's a

minimum amount of administrative entanglement#
All those were specifically spelled out by the
district court as reasons for sustaining the constitutionality
of this Act#
I don't think I need to say, to repeat, that the
State has wide authority in classifications in tax things,
and there is no precedent that I know of for holding this
unconstitutional*
The district court said, in holding that the secular
purpose as well as its effect were strong, the lightening
of the tax burden of those who contribute to public education,
while deriving no benefit from it for themselves, albeit theirs
is a voluntary choice, is a legitimate legislative purposeB
I accordingly request,Your Honors, that the judgment
of the district court be reversed as to tuition refund section,
and that that section be held constitutional; and that the
judgment of the district court as to the tax modification be
affirmed, and that likewise be held constitutional#
Thank you, Your Honors#

Mr» Haggerty,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. HAGGERTY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE ANDERSON
MR, HAGGERTY;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
An attack on a particular aspect of the State’s
effort in education fails, unfortunately, to look at the
State's responsibility and commitment for education in its
total aspect.
This is somewhat what has happened today»

It's my

purpose to outline the New York State Legislature's commitment
and responsibility for education»

Article XI, Section 1 of

the New York State Constitution fixes the primary duty to
provide for the education of all children in New York State
on the Legislature,

It requires that the Legislature provide

for a system of free schools, wherein all the children of
the State may be educated.
We educate four million children in the elementary
and secondary schools of New York State each year.

Approxi­

mately 18 percent, or 750,000 of these, attend the nonpublic
schools.
The cost of State financing of public education rose
to over $2»5 billion in the 1972-73 fiscal year, and increased
to $500 million over the 1969-70 year.
The cost to the State of educating the 750,000 non-

71

public schools is virtually non-existent*
educating — the total cost of education

The cost of
the State of New

York is $5 billion, another $2.,5 billion contributed by the
localities.
The support of the nonpublic school education is,
in the main, from contributions, endowments, and, of late,
approximately but not quite one-third, through tuition payments
by parents who, in addition to making these tuition payments,
also have a normal taxload.
QUESTIONt

But the people under $5,000 aren't

paying — in New York City, do the people under $5,000, with
five children, pay any taxes to the State of New York?
MR. HAGGERTYs

No, they don't.

But what I'm

attempting to do is to put into the total perspective of the
educational aspect —
QUESTION:

But they're paying sales taxes,

MR. HAGGERTYs
QUESTION:

They're paying sales taxes, —

— and other things.

MR. HAGGERTYs

— and they're paying, if they own

real property, some type of real property tax.
They do pay some type of real estate tax if there's
a chargeback by the landlord to a tenant in an apartment.
The greatly increased cost of nonpublic education,
plus ruinous inflation, plus ever-increasing taxes on all
levels of government, including education, has precipitated a

72
danger within the nonpublic school system in New York Stats.
I have delineated, in pages 11 through 15 of my
brief, why this is of such great consequence; to wit, there
is not a tax base to which the public schools can look in a
number of our cities, to increase their total commitment
towards education.
To fulfill its responsibility in the public sector,
the State contributes cash grants-in-aid, general cash
assistance on a per capita basis, and on a formula derived
through weighted average attendance as the primary form.
Faced with the crisis in the public schools, and
mindful of their responsibility for the education of all
children, including the children in nonpublic schools, the
Legislature enacted the program which is here under review»
They determined that it was in the public interest
and that it was important that not only the nonpublic school
system of education in New York continue to exist, but that
there be available a plurality of educational opportunity in
New York State,,
When talking about the children in

the nonpublic

schools, we’re talking about New York State citizens, about
our own children.

So, just as we provide for cash assistance

on a per capita aid basis in the public schools, the
Legislature responded by overwhelming proportions in the
private sector by enacting a program of moderate, minimal, and

73

varied assistance to low™income children and their parents,
and to middle™income parents, to support their voluntary
effort in education.
This is not a special isolated program, it's part
of the general program of assistance to education by New York
State.

Indeed, it would seem that if New York could so

determine, it could acquit itself of its educational
responsibility by total grant-in-aid assistance to all of
the parents, both public and nonpublic.
If that be the case, and allow those parents to
determine what schools they wanted to send their children,
whether it’s public or private, if that be the case it would
appear that New York, having made its choice of its machinery
or mechanism, to strike down the nonpublic sector, would be
to put form before substance.
Hew York’s minimal program of aid reflects the
appropriate and the required governmental neutrality toward
religion.

It neither governmentally establishes a religion,.,

nor goveramentally interfers with the religion.

Our task in

enacting the omnibus Act was, we felt, to reach that neutral
ground between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise
Clause,
The New York program does not encourage attendance
at nonpublic schools, indeed, in any event, it’s going to be
more costly.

The State is simply not involved in the parent's

74
choice of what school the parent chooses for their children.
While the program may enhance the ability of the
parent to exercise his choice of which school his child will
attend, it is nevertheless completely neutral in that it
does not favor religion over non-religion, it does not
sponsor a particular sect, nor does it try to encourage
participation in or abnegation of religion.
The question of whether or not a distinction should
be made for programs of aid to poverty area schools, to lowincome parents, should distinguish it from an over-all program.
In enacting legislation, it was felt strongly that
a program of aid, of health and welfare grants to low-income,
impoverished areas, which had certain restrictions, did fall
within the welfare assistance benefit program, and should be
considered as a welfare benefit program.
These restrictions are as followss

The schools

to be benefitted — and, incidentally, about 280 out of the
total 2,000 nonpublic schools are benefitted by Section 1 —
the schools to be benefitted must be schools which have a
substantial proportion of children attending whose parents
receive ADC.

In addition, under -- that's required by Title IVa

In addition, under Title IV, teachers in those
schools who had gone to higher education on loans would
receive a forgiveness from the Federal Government because
they are teaching in these type ghetto-area schools„

75
The school cannot be in violation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964»

To avoid the question of entanglement,

we require that the school provide a private audit, there's
no involvement of the State going in there; the school provides
a private audit, and that private audit is forwarded to the
State»
QUESTION:

You say this comes to about 280 schools

out of a total of around 2,000?
MR. HAGGERTY:

Yes.

There are 2,000 nonpublic

schools in the State, and 280 of the schools are benefitted
by Section 1»
QUESTION:

That's almost — under 15 percent*

MR. HAGGERTY:

Under 15 percent, it's about 12

percent, I believe*
The question arose as to whether or not the chapels
could be painted.

The answer to that is clearly no*

The

legislative findings are restricted to expenditures which are
clearly secular, neutral, and non-ideological in nature.
Expenditures for a chapel clearly could not fall
into that restrictive criteria*
The Commission of Education in the State of New York
is given the authority to promulgate rules and regulations
where he could not approve, as a result of getting this
private audit, -QUESTION:

I take it, that if the heating system

76

broke down, under the statute the entire heating system,
which also heated the chapel, could be replaced, could it
not?
MR. HAGGERTYi

The heating system could be replaced,

to the extent that it would fall within the definition of a
secular or non~ideological ~
QUESTION: Well, I know, but if you have a central
heating system in the school and it collapses and it has to
be replaced, and it heats every room, including the chapel, ~~
MR, HAGGERTY:
QUESTION:

Yes, —

— and under this statute it could be

replaced, could it not?
MR. HAGGERTY:

It could be replaced, but we have

built into the statute xtfhat we considered a statistical
requirement of neutrality, and that is that —
QUESTION:

I know, but —

MR. HAGGERTY:
QUESTION:

— not more than 50 percent —

—* as to

my question, it could be

replaced, could it not?
MR. HAGGERTY:

It could be replaced, but our

preposition in formulating the legislation was that we would
never get to a position where we would pay the total amount
of the repair or replacement of the heating system, because
in no event can the cost reimbursed by the State be more than
50 percent of the comparable cost in the public sector.

And

77
that we tried to build in as a statistical degree of
neutrality.
QUESTION: Well, my only point was, you may not be
able to paint the chapel under this, but you can repair the
heating system that heats that chapel, can't you?
MR» HAGGERTY:

That's correct, but our purpose was

not to provide for the total cost of repairing the heating
system.
QUESTION:

But I suppose implicit in your answer

is that in every few schools would the chapel exceed 50 percent
of the total heated space? is that a reasonable assumption?
MR, HAGGERTY:

That's correct, yes.

In answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, the answer as to
the question of whether we could provide such services or
such repairs to schools where all they teach is religion,
the answer is no, because, again, it must be only those areas
which are non-ideological, secular, and neutral,
QUESTION:

I wasn't talking about this statute, I

was talking about the one you're going to pass next year,
MR, HAGGERTY:

Hopefully we won’t have to do that.

The number of schools that are sectarian were
incorrectly stated in that 96 percent.

There's approximately

82 percent of the nonpublic schools in the State of New York
are sectarian.
And finally, with regard to the modification of gross,

78

adjusted gross income.» and whether or not that distinguishes
from any other type of income tax change.

Section 612(c) of

the New York State tax lav? provides for some 15 or 16
modifications, an example of which, you can modify your
adjusted Federal gross income by subtracting therefrom any
amounts of income derived through United States Savings plans?
this is a modification.
Well, what we do is add to Section 612(c) an
additional modification which would provide, on a reduced,
graduated scale, as you go up the line to an income of
$25,000, an amount which would be taken away or reduce your
Federal adjusted gross income for your New York State income
tax liability.
The purpose of this was that we would benefit the
parent who is benefitting the State by their voluntary effort
in the nonpublic or private school arena.

And we are doing

it on the fir3t level so that we benefit the parent before it
becomes involved in any types of State money.
Finally, I would suggest that, on the question of
modification of tax income, the Court look to the decision
of the majority below upholding the modification program, where
it points out that it does not involve a subsidy or grant of
money from the State treasury, it has a particular secular
intent, one of equity, to give some recompense by way of
tax relief to our citizens who bear their share of the burden

79

of maintaining the public schools and who, because of religious
belief or otherwise, send their children to nonpublic
full-time schools, as is their constitutional right, the
benefit to the public —- parochial schools, if any, is so
remote so as not to involve impermissible financial aid to
church schools.
And lastly, there is a minimum of administrative
entanglement with the nonpublic schools, nor is ongoing
political activity likely to cause division on strictly
religious lines.
It was out intent to reach the neutral point between
the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, and
we submit that the judgment of the court below, with regard to
the health and safety grants be reversed; and with regard to
the tuition reimbursement be reversed; and with regard to
tax modification be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.

I am going to limit myself to one question to you
on your rebuttal, Mr. Pfeffer.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFPER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, ET AL.
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Suppose you had — I start with your

80

comment this morning that there's no constitutional barrier
to the State of New York providing funds and tax credits to
private secular schools.

Suppose you had such a private

secular school maintained by anti-religious people, and all
these credits were given, does that give rise to any
possibility of violation of equal protection or possibly
the Free Exercise Clause?
MR. PFEFFER:

I think it may even give rise to a

question under the Establishment Clause as well.
QUESTION:

I said the Free Exercise Clause.

MR. PFEFFER:

Well, you can move on Free Exercise

free exercise and establishment, because the Establishment
Clause has been defined by this Court in a nunfoer of cases,
equally forbids aid to religion and aid to anti-religion.
The classic expression —
QUESTION:

Well, in my hypothetical, I wasn't

assuming that they had a sign on the building that this is
an anti-religious school, I'm simply assuming it's a secular
school —
MR» PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

A secular school.

MR. PFEFFER:
school.

No.

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

It's a —?

Oh, I thought you said an atheist
If it's a secular school, it —

Patronized by people who do not want

their children to have a religious education.

81

MR. PFEFFER;

Oh,

Oh, I’m sorry,

I misunderstood,

I thought you said atheist school.
No, if it's a purely secular school, then it's a
public school, because that's what this Court held under
McCollum and Engel v„ Vitale and the Schempp case,
QUESTION* Does that give you any equal protection
problem in that respect?
MR, PFEFFER* Well, I don't see — I don't see how
as a matter of fact, this Court has so decided in the Brusca
case, in affirming the Brusca case.

That was the argument

of the plaintiff in the Brusca case, that there was a violation
of equal protection because —
QUESTION; What case?
MR, PFEFFER:

The Brusca case, which I cited this

morning, with respect to a suit brought by parents of children
attending private schools, parochial schools, who claimed there
was a violation of free exercise, because the private schools
were excluded,
. The district court unanimously rejected, and this
Court affirmed without any dissent.
There is no — let me put it this ways
no violation of

There is

equal protection in a classification which

the First Amendment compels.

That's what this Court held,

the First Amendment compels, this Court said in Lemon-DiCenso,
compels non-support, in whole or in part, of parochial schools

82

And if the First Amendment compels it, then a State complying
with it, obviously is not —• is not following equal protection,
I should like to address myself primarily to what
I wasn't able to do this morning, the tax credit provision.
It is our contention that this is a tax credit
statute.

Mrs. Coon has conceded that's not a tax deduction

statute.

The court below called it a tax credit.
Nox*, it's not a tax deduction statute for obvious

reasons.

In a tax deduction you deduct from your gross income

the amount you contributed; that's what you do if you make a
contribution to a hospital, to an art museum, to a church.
Here you do not deduct that.
The State figures out for you, and in our brief and
in the jurisdictional statement of all the parties in their
briefs, the State figured out — on page 6 of my brief —*> the
amount you will get, benefit you will get by the deductions.
And it's clear that the deduction, the benefit starts where
the tuition grant stops; §50 per child.
Now, if you make — if I make a contribution of
$1,000 to a church, to an art museum, I deduct from my gross
income $1,000; and then my income tax is determined on the
balance.

If I pay tuition of, let's say, $50 for each child,

then that — I don't deduct $50 from my gross income, I
deduct up to $1,000 a child, up to $3,000 from my gross income.
Why?

In order to get the $50 which would be allowed to me?

83

per child»
And the State has done that itself, this is the
analysis given by the State Legislature*

It is simply using

the device of a tax system to achieve a payment to the parents
of children in the public school»
QUESTION*

That —

Mr. Pfeffer, you say this is a tax

credit.
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, how do you define a tax credit, as

opposed to a deduction or an exemption, when you're using that
term?
MR. PFEFFERs

All right.

I do it in several ways.

First, a deduction is one in which it is a uniform one in
respect to all contributions, there is no difference between
a grant, how much you contribute to an art museum, to a
scientific institution, to the ASPCA, from the amount you
deduct you contribute to a parochial school.
«■

Here there is a difference»

If you contribute $50 to

the art museum, you deduct $50 from your taxable incoxae»

Here,

if you pay $50, you don't deduct $50 from your taxable income,
you deduct $1,000 for each child*
QUESTION: Then your definition of tax credit is a
broader one than one which would simply say a tax credit is an
amount you subtract from the otherwise computed tax due»
MR. PFEFFERs

I say that the First Amendment —

84

QUESTION? Will you answer my question?
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes*

Under — in this context, yes*

In this context, this is a tax credit*

It would be a tax

credit if — let me —•
QUESTION:

But then it is a broader definition than

the one I just mentioned to you?
MR, PFEFFER:

It is a broader definition, yes, indeed*

And, indeed, Mrs. Coon conceded that.

She said this is not a

tax deduction.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pfeffer, suppose that New York

says for every child below the age of 18 you get 500 bucks'
deduction, and for all such children in private schools you
deduct 550?
MR. PFEFFER:

I would deem that unconstitutional„

I would deem that unconstitutional, because that’s an obvious
preference of

within the class of tax base.

In **« in —
QUESTION:

I’m still waiting for your answer.

MR. PFEFFER:

I said — I said I deem that

unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. PFEFFER:

Because this constitutes a benefit

exclusively limited to those who send their children to
parochial schools.
QUESTION s

Is that equal protection?

85

MR, PFEFFERs

It would be both equal protection and

establishment.
In any event, what this statute does, it recognizes,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's not a tax deduction because it
allows you-this money, even if you deduct, if you had
deductions, or even if you take a standardized deduction, if
you don't itemize, you've already got the benefit of the
deduction, whatever it is, ten percent, whatever it is.

The

statute specifically says that you still get it, you still
get this amount, even if you've already gotten the benefit of
the deduction.
QUESTION:

But what you get is something that you're

entitled to subtract from your adjusted gross income, not
something which you're entitled to subtract from the tax that
you've already computed to be due.
MR. PFEFFER: The only thing I can answer to that is
that this means elevating form of substance, it merely pretends,
and it is clear because, as the court below pointed out, that
this is a tax credit; and as all my opponents say, that the
purpose of this statute was the recognition of the serious
finance conditions of the private schools, and the nonpublic
education, they put it in one statute, all these things.
The whole purpose of this is to get money into the
private schools, or else the whole purpose of the statute fails.
Else the provisions regarding the impacted aid have no —

86

QUESTION s

But you could make that same argument if

you were simply here dealing with an orthodox tax deduction,
that the whole purpose was to get money to the private schools.
MR. PFEFFER;

Mo, sir.

Oh, no.

Because an

orthodox tax deduction applies equally to every type of
beneficiary, and the courts have answered that in Walz, that
where you have a uniform gift, a uniform treatment of all
non-profit organizations, museums and so on, then you avoid
entanglement.
QUESTIONS But supposing you weren't dealing with a
gift, that you're dealing with someone who is obviously a
payment for services rendered, tuition, and the State made
that simply deductible?
MR. PFEFFER:

I think that — for tuition

rendered# for services rendered in all instances?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR© PFEFFER:

If it were deductible as a deduction,

in other words, the amount you paid is deducted?

Well, I

think if it's deducted from your gross income, I think, as I've
indicated before, it may be constitutional? if it's deducted
from what you’re liable for, I think it would be unconstitu­
tional o
And that's what this has done here©

You aren't

deducting the amount of your tuition, you're deducting it
in the amount which the State figured

out would give you back

87

your tuition»
of $50»

A thousand dollars per child»

You pay tuition

You get a deduction of $1,000 up to $3^000, in order

to what?

In order that you can get your tax liability

reduced 50 — even if you've already gotten the deduction in
the form of a standardised deduction.

And the State says,

the statute says you've got to make a choice.

If you want to

get this money, you can get relief in two ways.
You can get it through a benefit of this, or you can
get it through a benefit of the tuition grant section»
They're both for the same purpose.

You take your choice»

We're going to give you your $50 back.

One way or the other»

You can take it through a tuition grant, assuming
you're under 5,000? you can take it through a tuition grant,
you can take it through this.
But, obviously, the purpose in both cases is saying
the same.
Now, I just want to make one point about what Mr»
Haggerty says about the fact that the money can't be used in
respect to the maintenance and repair, it cannot be used to
repair the heating system, as far as the chapel is concerned,
and so on.
Assuming that’s so — it isn't so; but assuming that's
so, that brings you back into the problem of entanglement»
That propels the State into checking how your money is used»
And an average is not enough, because in granting only 50 percent

88

of governmental funds, 50 percent in government funds, the
other 50 percent came from the college, yet the Supreme Court
said that you cannot use those premises for religious
purposes, even after twenty yearss even for one lecture in
religion, even for one mass, it said, after twenty years.
Even though the government pays only half.
But the fact that the government pays only half here
does not remove the constitutional taint.

The government

cannot, under the First Amendment, pay in whole or in part
for the maintenance of institutions which teach or practice
religion.

The Court said, long before Tilton, the Court said

that in McCollum v. Maryland, where only a few small portion
of the school,

for a half-hour or an hour a week was used

for religious education.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Pfeffer*

The case is submitted*

above-entitled matters was submittedo}
