MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

International Van Lines.
Mr.

Nash, I think you may proceed now.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER G. NASH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here is here on certiorari to the
Ninth Circuit which denied enforcement of provisions of a
National Labor Relations Board order requiring tye
reinstatement of four employees who were engaged in a strike
when they were discharged by their employer.

The question

presented here concerns the protection which the National
Labor Relations Act affords to employees engaged in a strike
against their employer for an economic objective, who are
discharged for that activity before they have been
permanently replaced by that employer.
Thus, do such strikers have an unconditional
right to reinstatement to their former jobs as the Board
found, or is that right to reinstatement lost if the
employer controls substantial and legitimate business
justifications for refusing to reinstate them as the court
below found?

The facts may be briefly summarized as follows,
in August, 1967 f the Teamsters Union commenced an organising
campaign amongst employees of ten to eleven moving and
storage companies within the Santa Maria, California area,
including the respondent, International Van Lines.
On September 21st, the union that had obtained
authorisation cards from five of six International
employees filed a representation petition with the Nationai
Labor Relations Board, a copy of which was then served upon
the company and received by it on September 25th.

A week

later, on October 2nd and 3rd, this union held meetings at
which union representatives told the employees that certain
t

companies being organized,, including International, had
withdrawn their consent for an NLRB election.,

There was also

some discussion at that time about the discharge of the
employees of other companies other than International.
In any event, the assembled employees decided to
strike and did so on October 4th.

Three of International’s

employees-—Diets, Manuel Vasques, and Mr. Casillas—refused
to cross the picket line, and a fourth, Robert Vasques, did
not report for work that day because of the picket line.
The president of International, Robert McEwen,
obtained temporary replacements the next day, October 5th,
from his brother, who had & similar moving and storage
company 'within the area, and sent telegrams to Manuel and

5
Robert Vasques and Dicus, advising them that they had been
permanently replaced,
Seven days later,, oh October 12th, the union had
filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board
alleging that Manuel and Robert Vasques, Casillas, and Diets
had all been discriminatorily discharged in violation of the
National Labor Relations Act.
Between October Oth and October 28th, Dicus and
Manuel Vasques each asked the president of the company,
Mr. McEwen, who was then hospitalised, whether each was going
to have a job, and neither received any commitment.
Dicus had the same experience shortly after
Mr. McEwen left the hospital on October 28th.

In the

latter part of November, Casillas, who had prior to that time
been a casual worker, asked Mr. McEwen to put him back on the
availability list for calls.

He received no particular

commitment, and he had not by the time of the hearing been
recalled to work.
On October 12th, Robert and Manuel Vasques and
Dicus asked Mr. McEwen to b@ reinstated and were refused.
The strike continued on at least through the hearing, which
commenced on April 3, 1968.
The Board found that tha company * s employees were
engaged in a protective strike to compel a consent election
and that even if the object of the strike was to compel

0
immediate recognition by the company of the union, it was a
protected strike»
Further,, the Board found that. Manuel and Robert
Vaaguez and Dicus were discharged by the telegram sent on
October 5th, for as a matter of fact they had not been
permanently replaced at that. time.

And, further, that all

four employees, which included Casillas, the casual
employee, were refused reinstatement upon their unconditional
offers or applications for reinstatement, which further
violated Sections 8(a)(3) end (1) of the National Labor
Relations Act.
The Board ordered reinstatement of all four of
these employees even if that reinstatement required the
discharge of strike replacements which may or may not have
been hired since the time of the discharge and the refusal
of reinstatement of these employees»
that all four of the

The Ninth Circuit found

employees had been discharged on

October 5th for engaging in a protected strike which sought
a consent election, that none had been permanently replaced
up until that time, and that, as such, those discharges
violated sections '8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor
Relations Act.
The court further found that three of the strikers,
exc3.uding Casillas at this point, the casual, made
unconditional requests for reinstatement which were denied,

/

7
and that Casillas had made a similar request but because he was
a casual employee, it was not clear to the Ninth Circuit
whether in fact he had been denied reinstatement or whether
there just had not yet been an opportunity to the employer
to call him back to work„

The court remanded that latter

issue to the Board.
However, despite these findings and despite an
assumption by the Ninth Circuit that employees who struck
after the discharge of these employees, who continued their
strike, might in fact be properly considered to be unfair
labor practice strikers, the court held that the discharged
strikers remained economic strikers, finding that to be their
status at the time they were in fact discharged.
Accordingly, although these employees had not been
replaced whan fired, the court found that they were not
entitled to reinstatement if the employer had a legitimate
and substantial business justification for refusing to
reinstate them, which includes the hiring of permanent
replacements since their discharge»
The court remanded the case to the Board to make
this determination.

In argument, I think it might be helpful

to discuss initially some of the general principles involved
in this area which are not, in my judgment,disputed.

Thus,

there is no dispute between the parties concerning the
validity of the consistently recognised distinction between

the reinstatement rights of unfair labor practice strikers
and economic strikers.
Unfair labor practice stri
strike activity either begins or is prolonged or aggravated
by reaction against employer unfair labor practices; and
economic strikers ara generally everybody else.

Economic

strikers are entitled to reinstatement at the and of their
strike, unless the employer controls some substantial and a
legitimate business justification for failing to reinstate
them, such as the continuing presence of permanent replace­
ments in their jobs.

The theory here is that although the

employer may not discriminate against those strikers, he does
have a legitimate interest in operating his business during
the strike and may, in the balancing of the interests and
equities involved, obtain permanent replacements for those
strikers.
Unfair labor practice strikers, on the other hand,
are entitled to unconditional reinstatement, regardless of
the employer’s business justification for not reinstating him,
including the presence of permanent replacements.

The theory

hare is that such strikers are acting to protect themselves
against the illegal acts of the employer which violate the
act.

And, although the employer can and has a legitimate

interest in operating his business during the strike, he may
not penalize his employees by permanently replacing them for

9
the acts which they have taken really in response to his
transgression.
Further elaborating on the foregoing, it is also
clear that a strike that starts as en economic strike may
in fact become an unfair labor practice strike, thus
converting the economic strikers into unfair labor practice
strikers where the employer’s commission of an unfair labor
practice has the effect of prolonging or aggravting the
strike.
And finally and apart from the discussion cf unfair
labor practice and economic striker, that distinction, it is
also clear that the discharge of economic strikers for
strike absences before they have been permanently replaced
is discrimination and violates sections 8(a)(3) and

(1) of

the National Labor Relations Act.
As 1 say, up to this point 1 think there is no
disagreement between the respondent and the petitioner nor
indeed by the court below.
Q

Is that what this case is about, even though

a person who is fired before he is permanently replaced is-—
what if he is fired but then permanently replaced?
MR. NASH;

That is what this case is about.

And

if that is a protected strike, then in fact he has under
all previous decisions—

Q

II© docs not cease to be an employee until he

10
is permanently replaced? is that it?
MR. NASH:
Q

That is correct.

The only way the employer can terminate him

is by replacing him?
MR. NASH:

By permanent replacements, that is correct.

He may not fire that employee.

And if he fires that

economic striker, if he fires the economic striker prior to
the time that that striker has beer» replaced, then that
striker has the unconditional right to return to his job.
0

If he, replaces him permanently, then he may

say to him, "You*re fired”?
MR. NASH:

That issue is not involved in this

particular case, and that gets into a question of the
Fleetwood and Laidlaw cases which extend additional rights
to economic strikers, even replaced economic strikers, the
right to go on a seniority register, if you will, and be
called back, other than discriminating against them by hiring
someone in their place later on.
Q

You may never really completely terminate the

rights of a totally replaced striker?
MR. NASH:

The full extent of the Fleetwood and

Laidlaw doctrines of the Board I don't think have been fully
explicated or examined either by this Court or by the Board.
That issue, however, is not involved in this particular case.
Q

Did not Mackay intimate that once a guy was

11
replaced, that was pretty well the end of it, if he was
legitimately replaced under the doctrine you have
esfcab1ished?
MR, NASH:

Yes, but that preceded by some number of

years ths Fleetwood decision of this Court and the ultimate
Laidlaw decision of the Board, which gives meaning I think to
the Fleetwood decision.
Q

Did Fleetwood, at least in part, overrule

Mackay?
MR. NASH:

To the esitent that Mackay indicated that

perhaps an employee could he discharged and his employment
status completely eliminated or terminated by reason of his
replacement to the extent that what 1 would call dicta in
that case is different than Fleetwood, yes.

It is implicitly

an extension of rights.
The court below, however, did find in this case
that all four of the strikers were discharged before they
had been permanently replaced; they could not as a matter
of law require any greater reinstatement rights than those
of economic strikers.

That was the status that they held

at the time of their discharge.

And this is true in the

Ninth Circuit’s view, even if those discharges converted
the strike in question and the strikers f the non--discharged
strikers, into unfair labor practice strike and into an
unfair labor practice group of strikers.

I think that the

12
court's position is erroneous for at least two reasons.
First r wholly apart from whether the four
dischargees became unfair .labor practice strikers or not.,
the respondent, because of its action in unlawfully
discharging them as an unconditional obligation to
reinstatement, the classic remedy for an unlawful discharge
of an employee is unconditional reinstatement, for that is
the best way to restore the status quo ante.

This holds

true whether the discharges was unlawfully discharged from
active duty or whether he was unlawfully discharged from the
picket line before he had been replaced.
In the latter case, the striker, not having been
replaced at that time", at the time of his wrongful discharge,
had an unconditional right to return to work.

He was

terminated from that position? and, in order to replace and
put things back in the status quo, that wrongfully terminated
striker should be in the same position that he was in before
he was discharged, which is the position of an economic
striker with an unconditional ability to return.
Thus, the circuits have uniformly held that without
regard to v?hether the strike subsequently takes on the
nature of a protest against an employer's unfair labor
practice, that that employer may not lawfully terminate
economic strikers prior to the time they have been validly
replaced, and that the appropriate remedy, therefore, is

13
reinstatement, even if that requires the displacement of
post-firing replacements.
Just as an employer may not deny reinstatement to
an employee unlawfully discharged while he is actively
working, on the grounds that he subsequently replace that
discharged employee, so too a striking employee can have no
less protection.

To hold otherwise, I think, would be to

recognise a distinction between non-strike concerted
activities, protected by Section 7 of the National Labor
Relations Act and strike activities similarly protected.
Congress did not authorise such a distinction to be made
and rightly so, for no one can deny that the right to
legally strike is one of the paramount protected activities
under the National Labor Relations Act and, indeed, Congress
so recognized specifically in passing Section 13 of that act.
Secondly and contrary to the court below, the
Board could properly find that by continuing to strike after
their unlawful discharge, the four dischargees in this case
became unfair labor practice strikers.

It is, I submit, a

reasonable inference for the Board to make that dischargees
have added to their protests against their employer their
unlawful discharge.

And, further, that the unfair labor

practice of firing a striker has such an effect upon a strike
is to tend to prolong it.

At the very least, the Board in

the exercise of its expertise, may, I submit, properly

conclude that, the discriminatory and unlawful discharge of
strikers is so likely to have an impact upon the strike
itself that such an act by the employer shifts the burden to
that employer to show that the strike was not in fact
impacted by the illegal discharges.
Q

Kbr. Nash, what do you think the record shows

here as to that detail, that it did or did not have an
effect on the prolongation of the strike?
MR. NASH:

That is the second part of the augment

here, and I believe that the record shows quite clearly that
it did have an effect upon the prolongation of the strike
and certainly upon the prolongation of the strike by these
four employees or, in fact, they unconditionally asked to be
reinstated, were denied that request, and continued or» strike,
and that was back in December of 1967, and continued as
strikers at least on through April 3, 1968.

So that 1 think

without question, at. least as to those four particular
employees, the strike continued well on past what it would
have, had their original
Q

grievance bean resolved.

Incidentally, now that I have you

interrupted, does the record- show whether they knew why they
were striking?
MR. NASH:

The record indicatas that seme of these

four employees did know.

One of them, at least, was

present at the meeting with the union at which the employers

15
believed withdrawal of his consent to a Board election was
one of the circumstances that prompted the strike♦
Q

You say that the Board was justified in making

the assignments.

I take it you complain that the Court of

Appeals did not give full weight to"-what is the question
before us, then, under Universal Camera and Pittsburgh
Steamship?

We do not simply sit in the place of the Court

of Appeals and. say would we have upheld the court, do we?
MR. NASH?

The Court of Appeals merely said that

even assuming that this now becomes an unfair labor practice
strike, after you have discharged these four employees,
because the four employees were themselves economic
strikers at the time they are discharged, there was no way
as a matter of law, no matter what the Board may show as a
matter of fact, that those four people can ever become other
than econoraic strikers, because that is the status that they
held at the time of the discharge.

And my complaint that 1

bring to you today is that the Ninth Circuit is as wrong as
it can be in making that kind of judgment? as a matter of
law, they are wrong.

That not only do those employees under

the facts in this case become unfair labor practice
strikers with full rights to reinstatement, but, furthermore,
even if they are economic strikers

and remain economic

strikers, they are fired economic strikers 'who at the time
they were fired had not been replaced by anyone else and

16
thus have the unconditional right to return to work on that
day, because they had not been replaced? and that the
appropriate remedy for that situation is to put them back
into the situation they were in when they were discharged,
which is an unconditional right to reinstatement, regardless
of what happened after the day that they were discharged.
Q

Does it make any difference as to the time

when the claimed unfair labor practice occurred in relation
to the time of their conversion from being economic strikers
to unfair labor practice strikers?
MR. WASHi
Q

Yes, 1 think—

Before any unfair labor practice occurred.

MR. NASH:

They were permanently replaced before

an unfair labor practice occurred.
presented in this case.

That issue is not

But, in my judgment, they would then

foe permanently replaced economic strikers who would not
have the unconditional right to return.
Q

So, their conversion, if we can call it that,

must relate to an unfair labor practice which had existed
while they were economic strikers? is that what you are
telling us?
MR. NASH:

If there is in fact to be a conversion

rather than the strike starting initially as an unfair
labor—yes, there must be unfair labor practice and then
they become unfair labor practice strikers.

17
Q

In effect, then, could it be said that they

were striking in a dual capacity from the outset here?
MR. HASH:

Ho, because they were not fired until the

second day of the strike.

Initially they could not have

been obviously objecting to their discharge, because they
had not yet been discharged.
Q

But it comes under some other kind of an

unfair labor practice?
MR. HASH;

Yes.

They could very well have been

dual purpose strikers, in which event they would be unfair
labor practice strikers, unless the employer can come
forward, I believe with compelling evidence to disentangle
the morass that he himself has caused by committing unfair
labor practices and shewing as a matter of fact that the
unfair labor practices had nothing to do with the strike or
the prolongation of the strike.
Q

Mr. Hash, in answer to the Chief Justice you

suggested in a hypothetical case that had they been replaced
before they were discharged, then that would be no unfair
labor practice and they would be out.
MR. HASH;

Had they been permanently replaced?

Q

They would be out?

Yes.

MR. HASH:

Yes, they would be—at the time they

were fired—
Q

My question, How is that consistent with the

18
answer you gave Mr. Justice Rehnquist before as to the effect
of Fleetwood on this Board case?
MR. NASH;

That is inconsistent with the answer

I gave Mr. Justice Rehnquist to this extent:

Mher. I mean

they are out. 1 mean they are then replaced economic strikers
at the time that they are fired, and they would be returned
to the position of replaced economic strikers, which would
mean that they do not have the unconditional right to return
to work but may have the subsequent
rights, which

Fleetwood and ha id. law

would be the rights to corae back when rights

do in fact occur.
Q

Your position depends entirely on chronology?

on which happens first really, the discharge or the
permanent replacement.
one result ensues.

If one happens a day before the other,

If it is just the reverse by one day—

MR. NASH;

I think strictly speaking, yes, the

employer has a right during an economic strike to permanently
replace strikers.

And to the extent that the employer does

that, he commits no violation of the National Labor Relations
Act.

If the next day—
Q

He makes no violation by what, by not re­

employing the striker?
MR. NASH;

First of all, he does not commit it by

employing a permanent replacement.
Q

Right.

19
MR. NASH:

If on the next day he fires a striker,

evers though he has been replaced, he commits a violation of
the act.

He violates Section 8(a)(3)? he has discriminatorily

discharged a striker.

He. has taken away whatever rights the

Fleetwood and Laidlaw may give him.

Let us assume no

discharge on the second day; the strike ends and the striker
says, "I now want to come back to work."

The employer

then says, "You have no unconditional right to return to
work because you were replaced, permanently replaced.

You

will go on a Laidlaw list, if you will, and when an opening
occurs, I will be calling you under those circumstances.”
And although that issue is not present in this case, there
would be no violation in the refusal to reinstate at that
point.
Q
chronlogy,

Mr. Nash, is the case really as simple as
Mr. Justice Blackiaun referred to the discharge

happening on one day and replacements being employed the
next day.
minutes.

Suppose it would happen within an hour or ten
Are there any principles involved or does it just

depend on whether the employer was smart enough to say, "I
hire you to replace John Smith■and then advises John
Smith, "You are fired," or whether he reverses that process?
MR. NASH:

I do not know of any case on the books,

but in the different capacities as General Counsel, as an
investigator and prosecutor of unfair labor practices, I

20

would look carefully at that set of events that you just
posed to 3ae if, in fact, that that was not a ruse and what
was not in fact intended was a discharge before replacement
in both circumstances»

And there might very well, under tic-

facts of that case, be found to be a violation.

But given

a clean, permanent replacement and a subsequent refusal to
reinstate, there would not, in my judgment, be a violation.
Q

That would be entirely a factual determination,

would it not?
MR. HASH:
Q

Yes, the latter would .be.

On a case by case basis.

You could not have

a general rule about that, could you, except that subterfuge,
to the extent that would be a principle, that subterfuge
would be penetrated,
MR. MASH:

Right.

I think that the only general

principle is that you cannot discriminate against people
because they exercise their rights under Section 7 or the act
and that, whether there is discrimination or not, obviously
involves a factual question in each case.
I think the problem created by this case can best
be put in focus by a practical hypothetical.

Under the

circumstances now allov7ed by the Ninth Circuit, an employer
during an economic strike fired all of his economic strikers.
At that point, if the Ninth Circuit’s decision stood, those
employees would have no unconditional right to return to work

21
unless they immediately came in and said to the employer,

rv

We •

want to coxae back to work unconditionally at this point,"
before they had been permanently replaced.

That adds an addi­

tional risk to the risk of an economic striker, which I do not
think is justified in law nor by any of the decisions prior to
the time that the Ninth Circuit came down with its decision.
It adds an additional risk that the employees must immediately
come back in—the strikers must immediately come back in and
sav,

"We give up our strike, we want to come bad-: to work ?" a

risk that they do not have as economic strikers.

For, although

they might be permanently replaced, the goal of that replace­
ment has not. come to their attention immediately, they do not
feel that kind of compunction to give up their strike, and I
submit to allow the Ninth Circuit’s decision to stand in
essence means than an employer can break strikes by violating
the act.

Thank you very much.

I will save the rest of ray

time, if I may, for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Nash,

Mr. Kirshman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN R. KIRSHMAN, ESO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, KIRSHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think the essence of the case before you and the
holding of the Ninth Circuit is very simple.

The Ninth

22
Circuit has held for a rule of evidence»

The Ninth Circuit

has said- "We will not call an automatic conversion of an
economic striker to an unfair labor practice striker without
substantial evidence that the unlawful act of the employer
has prolonged the strike."

And, I refer the Court to page 34

of our brief on the merits, quoting from the Court.

The

court points out in the middle of the page that the Board
has made a finding, the Board has argued that the employer’s
unfair labor practices substantially prolonged the strike,
were a significant factor in the strike.

And then the court

concludes by saying, "The Board adduces no evidence in
support of this necessary effect."
We submit that the Ninth Circuit has done no more
and no less than say that it will not accept a per se
conversion, because the essence of an unfair labor practice
striker is an individual who is on strike protesting the
unfair labor practice»

It is a question of cause and effect.

And cause and effect, must necessarily require evidence.
The Ninth Circuit is not alone,with all due respect
to the General Counsel; the Ninth Circuit is in the company
of the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit and the Seventh
Circuit in the Thompson case, in the Frick case, and in
Jackson Printing.

In each case the circuits recognised the

cause and effect situation and required evidence.

I think

that the Board has the burden, if it is intending to impose

23
a severe restriction of unconditional reinstatement, of
proving that the conduct of the employer prolonged the strike
and the court below merely said that the economic strikers
were cn strike for a prior complaint, that there was no
unfair labor practice strike at the time they went on strike,
and that the employer's conduct, though unlawful, may or may
not have had a bearing on their continued picket line
conduct.

And 1 respectfully refer the Court to the fact that

the record shows that with the exception of the December 12th
reqtiest for reinstatement, all other requests as late as
April a few days before the hearing in the case were
predicated and conditioned upon the signing by the employer
of a contract and not any contract but a specific contract.
Q

Were these employees permanently replaced?

MR. K1RSIIMAN:

The finding of the Board was unclear

on that issue, sir, and for that reason the court remanded—
the court said that they were not~-no, may I correct myself?
The court

said that they were not permanently replaced at

the time of the unlawful discharge.

But the court said that

the record was unclear as to whether they were permanently
replaced before they applied for reinstatement, and that was
one of the issues upon which the court remanded to the Board
for further proceedings to determine whether there were
substantial business justifications.
Q

How could an employer refuse to reinstate a

If they were economic strikers,

they were only entitled to reinstatement if they had not been

Until they have been permanently replaced,

they have got a right to reinstatement.
MR. KIRSHMAN:

That is true.

Why are the people in this case entitled to

Why do we dream

held that when they were discharged, they had not been

application they are entitled to their jobs hack unless they
have been permanently replaced; or is it the employer's
burden to show that they had been if he is to withstand the
application of evidence?
MR. KIRSHMAN:

We submit that the employer has the

burden of showing that they have not been permanently
replaced? yes, Your Honor.

So that

unless they did something after that to clarify it, you have
a very muddy picture» have you not?
MR. KXRSHM&N?

That is exactly the picture that

the Ninth Circuit had before it, Your Honor.
Q

The Board takes the position that it does not

make any difference whether they were permanently replaced?
as long as they were fired beforehand, you do not need a
finding about—MR. KlRSHMAN:
Your Honor.

That is the position of the Board,

And the position of the Board is that that

result occurs regardless of the evidence, whether or not
there is any evidence.

And, as I said, we submit that the

Second, Third, and Seventh Circuits provide for a more
rational view of the case.
I would like to proceed at this point to an issue
that may or may not be before the Court, but respondent has
included it in its brief and in the answer which we feel was
in the nature of a cross-petition.

And that question is

fairly comprised within the question of reinstatement and
threshold to it.

Before you can reach the question of

reinstatement, we must have

a finding of unlawful conduct

in the first place, and we believe that in our supplemental
brief, which was filed with the Court, that the 90-day
period does not run from a jurisdictional standpoint and

27
that the Court raay consider this issue, if it feels that the
issue is worthy of consideration.

As we have discussed,

the decision of the Ninth Circuit was not

&

final decree,,

The employer was under no obligation to do anything at that
point.

The case was sent to the Board for the taking of

further evidence»

Therefore, we feel that there was no

final judgment for purposes of the 90-day period in respect
to a petition for certiorari.
The issue that we would like to address ourselves
to is whether a strike to force the employer to consent to
an election, in effect to force the employer to forego his
access to the Board, is protected activity.

And we have

set out in our brief the legislative history and the actual
wording of the statute and the regulations.

And we conclude,

with all humility, that the employer has an absolute right
to his hearing in a representation case.
right.

This is a statutory

There was disagreement in the Congress in 1947 as to

whether there should be provisions for pre-election, for
pre-hearing elections, and the majority in the Congress
determined that the tearing was important enough so that it
was set forth in mandatory terms.
for the hearing is critical.

The access to the Board

It provides, one, a question

into the jurisdiction of the Board, in the first instance„
the appropriateness of the bargaining unit, eligibility to
vote, and collateral issues.

28

A strike to force the employer to forego this hearing
we submit is a strike in derogation of the orderly processes
of the Board.

It is an invitation to a labor union to stand

up and say, "We will strike unless you forego your right to
have the regional director and the Board determine whether
this election should be held in the first place and, if it is
held, who should vote."

We do not believe that this is in

the interest of the national labor policy.

We do not believe

it is consistent with the spirit of the Boys Market case.
We do not believe it is consistent with those cases that
indicate that arbitration is preferable to a strike or a
muscle-to-muscle confrontation.
Q

Is this an argument that in fact this was an

unfair labor practice strike on the part of the union?
MR. KXRSHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe further that to compound this problem,
this particular strike had a dual facet.

The Board found

alternately that it was a strike to force the consent and
also could have been a strike for recognition.

I already

covered the question of a strike to force a consent.

In

respect to a strike to force immediate recognition, I submit
to the Court that the failure by the union to notify the
employer in any manner other than by receipt by the'
employer from the Board of the petition itself and the
failure by the union to comply with the Board's regulations

29
in Section 9(c)(4) of the act, which requires an allegation
in the petition of a demand for recognition and a refusal,
that this basic jurisdictional defect in that petition
rendered the petition a nullity.

I think that in the

context of the union's activity here in fabricating—and
this is a finding by the trial examiner which was not
disturbed by the Board or the court, that the union here
fabricated a labor dispute, willfully fabricated a dispute
on a non-existent grievance that in the context of that
fabrication the failure to allege in the petition that there
was a demand, that there was a refusal, renders that
petition fatally defective; and the picketing which continued
for more than 30 days, with such a fatally defective
petition, in our opinion, rendered that strike a violation of
Section 8(b)(7) of the act.

And the authorities are quite

clear that an employer has no obligation to reinstate any
striker who strikes in violation of 8<h)(7) of the act.
I think that we have a basic question before the
Court on the consent and/or recognition issues, and that
question is, Do the processes of the Board prevail?

Are they

available to the employer in the sanie fashion that they are
available to the employees?

Is the mandatory language of

Congress—and Congress did not say "aav," it said ''shall” —
is the language of the implementing regulations which says
that upon the filing of a petition in accordance with the

30

rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, are they not
set up as a condition precedent to the processing of a valid
petition?
Or,, on the alternative, do we say that the right to
strike is so powerful, is so important—and we clo not
undermine that right, it is. powerful, it is important, but
where is the balance?

Do we invite labor to ignore the

Board, not on peripheral issues but on a basic due process
issue, the question of the employer’s right to a hearing?
1 submit that that is what the Court is faced with on the
underlying threshold issues which in respondent’s view are
far more significant and far more important than the rule of
evidence which has been promulgated by the court below.
be can live v?ith a rule of evidence.

A rule of

evidence can be interpreted very strictly by the Board.

I

think if the Board clearly said in this case that the
company failed to sustain its burden of proof, if it has such
a burden, that the unfair labor practices did not prolong the
strike, 1 might be able to accept that as a lawyer.
Board did not say that.

But the

The Board urges an automatic per se

conversion theory, notwithstanding the evidence, notwith­
standing whether the unfair labor practice occurs one day
before the strike, six months before the strike, six months
after the strike, a per se rule.

And I believe in the law,

especially in the law of Xcibor relations.

Der se rules are

31

very dangerous.

Much in the practice of labor law and much

in our functioning here in labor relations is not so much what
the employer does, it how he says what he does.

And,, for

example, if an employer says, "I am going to discharge you
or I am going to replace you," there are entirely different
connotations that the Board could place upon this semantical
difference.

Basically, these are our three issues.

The

consent—a strike to for a consent is not protective
activity, and the cases

cited by the Board do not support

that proposition, Your Honors.
I would li'ice to comment briefly on Washington
Aluminum. which is cited by the Board as this Court's
authority for the fact that a strike for immediate
recognition or any protest without notice is still protective
activity.

I refer the Court to the fact that in Washington

Aluminum there was no labor union.

The employees were not

represented and the employees had an instant sit-down strike
based upon working conditions, a cold shop»

That is a far

cry from International Van, where there v;as a labor union, a
petition filed with the Board, and a fabricated reason for
the strike.

I submit that as a further argument for the

unprotected nature of these activities, is that there was no
labor dispute, and 2 am well aware of the MacKay language
which talks about the wisdom or unwisdom of the employee's
activities in going on strike.

a remand?
MR. KIRSHMAN:

Appeals, Your Honor, should have-—
Q

You did not cross-petition?

MR. KIRSHMAN:

We believe we did, Your Honor.

Cur

answer was in the nature of a cross-petition, and we believe
that it was timely, and we believe that there is such plain
error in this record—
Q

You can support the judgment below on any

ground available to you, but you cannot get any more than you
got below.
MR. KIRSHMAN:

Honor, that we are entitled to more than we received below
because our answer—
Q

You did not follow the ground rules, did you?

MR. KIRSHMAN:
respect.

I think we do, sir, with all due

Our answer wets filed, raising new issues.

And,

although it did not label itself as a cross-petition, I think
that the fact that we attempted to raise new issues, if we are
not jurisdictionally untimely—

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

In addition to the

question presented to the Board, respondent respectfully
submits the following additional question.
MR. KIRSHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

33
Q

As Mr. Justice White asked, really what you

wanted was a denial of the question of the Board*s order.
MR. KIRSHMAN:
Q

In its entirety.

in that way it was a remand to the Board for

further proceeding.
MR. KIRSHMAN:

That is correct. Your Honor.

But we

got the remand on the issue that we were not as concerned
about,
Q

That is just it.

That is why I wondered

whether without it—maybe it sounds rather technical, but
ordinarily if you want to raise an issue which gives you a
different judgment than you are here to defend, you have to
cross-petition, do you not?
MR. KIRSHMAN:
yes, Your Honor.

We believe that the document trial—

And, further, Your Honor, we believe under

the Court’s rule 23(1)(c), if the Court believes that the
issues are so interrelated that you cannot reach a Question of
damages, which is the question of remedy, without reaching
the question of liability, that perhaps the Court in its
discretion could take it.
Q

Did you deliberately choose the form you did

rather than cross-petition?
MR. KIRSHMAN?

No, Your Honor.

I must confess this

is my first trip before the Court and I fumbled somewhat.
I would like to comment just briefly on one more

34
issue, and that is the question of the labor dispute,
whether or not there was a labor dispute.

I believe that

under the facts in this case the one element of MacKay,
which talks about the mistaken judgment of the employees or
the wisdom or unwisdom of going on strike for a reason which
is not correct implies good faith.

I think when you examine

a willful fabrication of a reason to go on strike, the
element of a good faith mistake disappears, and we open the
door to permitting employees or a union or a union
representing employees to fashion a labor dispute out of
thin air any time they want to bring the conduct within the
purview of the act.

And, once again, I believe that Section

2 of the act says quite clearly or at least implies that the
Board has no jurisdiction to inquire into a dispute which is
not a labor dispute.

And, there again, in my attempt to

bootstrap, I would believe that this Court could inquire into
a jursdictional error, even if not raised in the court
below.

But we did raise these issues at trial.
