MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now in No, 71-1694, Frontier© v. Melvin R. Laird, et al.
Mr. Levin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH LEVIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This is a sex discrimination case.
After a short statement of the facts here, 1 will
seek to refute the Government's statistical analysis of the
case and point to what we consider to be the insubstantlability
of the Government's interest in continuing this particular sex
discrimination.
Following this, I will speak briefly about the merits
of judging sex classifications by what we consider to be an
intermediate test.
Professor Ginsburg, to ray left, will then speak on
the merits of judging these cases by the standard of strict
scrutiny.
A year after entering the Armed Forces in 1968,
Lieutenant Sharron Frontiero married Joseph Frontiero.
Because of the statutes which are at issue here,
any male member of the Armed Forces would have automatically
become entitled to certain housing allowance benefits and

4
medical benefits.
Lieutenant Frontier© did not.
The statutes giving males in the Armed Forces the
irregrefcfcable presumption that their spouses are dependent and
grant benefits regardless of the wife's actual financial depen­
dency.
A female must prove that her spouse is, in fact,
dependent upon her for more than one-half of his support.
In this case, Lt. Frontiero earned more than three
times as much as her husband, Joseph.
$8200.

Her income is approximately

His income is just a little in excess of $2800.
But because Joseph's Individual expenses are low

his small income meets more than half of his personal expenses.
Sharron was, therefore, denied any supplemental
benefits in both housing and medical for her spouse.
It is undisputed that under these statutes, the ones
that are at issue here, that a male Armed Forces member would
have received these housing and medical benefits.
So we have a two-fold discrimination.

The first is

procedural.
Women are forced to the burdens and uncertainties
of proving that their spouses are, in fact, dependent upon them,
while males are given the benefits automatically, and irrefutably.
But more importantly, there is substantive discrimina­
tion here.

5
Males whose wives are not financially dependent upon
them,nevertheless ,receive these housing and medical benefits.
Women in precisely the same circumstances, identical
circumstances, do not receive the benefits.
Government really seeks to explain away this dis­
crimination by saying that it is only a procedural difference,
and that since women earn less than men that they can presume
for the sake -- and 1 am talking about women in the general
*

population -- that they can presume for the sake of administra­
tive convenience, or administrative ease, that the male spouses
are financially dependent.
*

We have three relatively simple answers to the
Government's contention that lower income shows dependency.
First of all, earning levels don't, alone, necessarily
indicate dependency.
Q

Does earning level indicate a general tendency, do

you think?
MR. LEVIN:

I think that earning level -- not

necessarily even a general tendency — I would think that you
could say that in the whole population that it does indicate a
tendency that men earn more than women.
We don't dispute that.

We don't dispute that at all.

But the only reason that Joseph Frontiero's expense
-- only because his expenses are low is he technically not onehalf financially dependent upon his wife, Sharron Frontiero.

6
which is the criteria and the standard that women are forced
to submit to under these statutes.
And this is in spite of the fact that his income is
less than one-third of her income.
So, though we feel that income and expenses are
relevant in this case, the Government wants to take into account
only income.
If they realty believe that income is the only
predictor of dependency, then why not make that the standard
for determining dependency.
Instead, they take a biological class, women, and
they ascribe a status to the entire class without reservation.
If they believe that lower income equals dependency,
then let them protect their own interests by making that, that
is, income, the criterion and end the sex discrmination.
They could do this with a narrowly drawn statute.
How, we doubt that what the Government refers to in
its brief as -- if I recall it correctly -- "economic facts of
life,” are really facts at all.
Their own statistics, as set out on page 51 of our
own blue brief, show that Armed Forces males actually earn less
than females.
Noxo, if lower income equals dependency, the majority
of Armed Forces males who are now granted an irrefutable pre­
sumption, would not be able to prove their spouses dependent.

7
Mow, they say that our use of this kind of comparison,
is kind of like missing apples and oranges.
q

Is if a median head count of Armed Forces males and

•B •**

MR. LEVIH:
Q

Of Armed Forces males, yes.

The reason is there is a higher percentage of non­

commissioned and commissioned officers among the female,
1 suppose.

That would have to be the reason, wouldn’t it?

MR. LEVIN:
Q

It very well could be.

And we are dealing here with military personnel whose

spouses are civilians, are we not?
MR. LEVIW:

Let's assume that the Government is

correct in what they say and that we should not have used —
Q

Does this case involve only military personnel whose

spouses are civilians?
MR. LEVIN:

Yes, sir, it would.

That is correct.

Mow, let's say that the Government is correct in
what they have to say about our analysis that way.

They

suggest that we should instead use the figure for all women,
instead of just women in the working population.
Well, let's do that.
Mow, the census shows that for all women -- and this
is for everyone over the age of 14, regardless of whether or
not they are employed, that for all women there is a median
income of $2400.

8
If we lump the military males’ median income which is
$3700 with the median income of the female, we come up with
$6100 lump sum median.
Now, the dependency standard, we recall, is one-half,
in fact, or one-half dependency.
For a woman to fail to provide,that is the wife of
an Air Force or any Armed Services member, for her to fail to
provide one-half of her own support, she would have to have
expenses that total $4800, which would be over 80% of the
entire family's income.
Now, we don't think the Government can prove or is
saying here that service families wives are such spendthrifts.
I don’t believe there is any way to prove it.
But, this whole analytical approach of statistics is
extremely misleading.

We don’t think that it has any particular

relevancy in this case, because the crucial aspect of it is the
substantive inequality which results here.
And, that is, when you get right down to the bottom,
that males who cannot prove their wives dependent, nevertheless
receive the benefits.
Women in the identical position do not.

And there is

no way to cure that.
There is no way to cure that in Sharron Frontiero's
case.
Q

How many are we talking about in terms of numbers?

9
I suppose, what, 98**9970 of the military personnel are
males, or is that too high a percentage?
MR. LEVIN:

1 don’t have access to these percentages.

I recall the figures are that there are approximately 1,000,005
married male service members, and that there are somewhere in
excess of -- I am told by the Government -- new figures are
somewhat in excess of 6,000 married female service members.
Q

So it would be a percentage somewhat comparable to

that I mentioned?
MR. LEVIN:

Very well could be.

I have not computed

this, but I would say that would be approximate.
Q

As I understood it, a good part of the Government’s

argument is based upon administrative simplicity, is it not?
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Justice, the only part of the

Government’s argument, their entire argument, is based upon
administrative convenience, and that is all that they have
alleged here and that is the only justification.
Now,we don't say that this is an illegitimate end,
because, of course, it isn’t.
But, it in itself, cannot justify the discrimination
that exists here.
It it did, any arbitrary cutoff in benefits would be
constitutional.
In Shapiro v. Thompson, in Reed v, Reed, we feel that
this Court explicitly rejected administrative convenience as

10

justifying this kind of disemination.
And, the court in Shapiro explicitly stated that this
interest was insufficient regardless of whether measured against
tiie rational basis or the compelling State interest standard.
Now, the Government has proposed that the minimal
standard of review be used here.
The Amicus, American Civil Liberties Union, has
proposed that the — and we will argue -- that the strict
standard of suspect classification is appropriate for this
case.
Now, we, as appellant, suggest that the strict
standard applicable •- that the strict standard here does not
pose a choice between polar alternatives.
We agree wholeheartedly with what Mr. Justice Powell
had to say in Weber v, Aetna, that regardless of the test
employed here, that the essential inquiry is inevitably a dual
one, what legitimate State interest does the classification
promote and what fundamental personal rights -- personal rights
— might the classification endanger.
Now, here, the classification that we are talking
about surrounds employment benefits.

And this Is an area of

discrimination in which women have been discriminated against
-- have been the object of discrimination, I think, and that
is well documented.
The Government’s approach employs sort of a reverse

II
bootstraps theory, where their reasoning is the traditional
discrimination in employment should be rewarded by further
discrimination in employment benefits, if you look at the
figures they attempt to use.
Now, we have got to stack up against the women's
right to be free from these inequalities, and what the Government
stacks up against the right of women to be free from inequali­
ties is the ease of administration.

That's the only thing

that they really advance in this case.
Q

You say that it is a personal right you are claiming

here, following the analysis in Weber.

It is a personal right

to more money, isn't it?
MR* LEVIN:

It is a personal right, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, to be free from discrimination in employment, and
Q

But you can argue any equal protection that way.

You are saying, in effect, I want to be free from this dis­
crimination that I claim exists, but I would think if you follow
the Weber analogy you've got to see what it is you are claiming,
what you would get if your claim were sustained, which is
more money, in your case.
MR. LEVIN:

I think so too, but I think with the

personal right that X am talking about, and I think that the
kind of personal right that the Court was talking about —
Mr. Justice Powell was taIking about for the Court in Weber
was the right to be -- for a group to be free from discrimination.

12
Here, that is the right for women, as a group, to be
free from discrimination, and that you’ve got to look at the
facts involved in that case.
You have to look at the facts and you have to
determine whether or not the Government has advanced a suf­
ficient — or a legitimate, as the language is here, governmental
interest.
For example, evidence might be educed to show that a
sex difference which related to performance in combat would be
a legitimate governmental interest.
It might be.

I am not saying it would, but it

might be.
Here, the Air Force certainly doesn’t claim that the
general earning differential, that you see in the population as
a whole, would justify discrimination, sex discrimination in
basic pay.
So, it certainly couldn't justify sex discrimination
in fringe benefits.
We think that Mr. Justice Powell's analysis in Weber
is a legitimate method for determining what standard is to be
used in this case.
It is stronger than the minimal scrutiny standard
which the Government proposes.
We feel that a burden should be placed on both the
Government, the Government to show a legitimate Governmental

13
interest, and on the appellant to show that there is dis~
crimination.
We think that there should he equal burdens here.
The test should be stronger than it is now*
Q

Do you feel that a statute enacted by the Congress

or a statute enacted by the legislature of a State was pre­
sumptively constitutional?

You don't hear very much about that

any more, but when I went to law school, that's what the
doctrine was.
MR. LEVIN:

I think that that is fine except when

the State is classifying different groups, and especially when
they are classifying a group which has traditionally been the
object of discrimination; and, consequently the lower standard
in sex discrimination cases, the minimal scrutiny standard,
simply isn't sufficient.
Q

Now, it gets so that statutes enacted in that area

is only, sort of, step one, isn't it?
MR. LEVIN:

Step one, before it is tested.

Well, I think the legislature should consider this
in passing legislation.
And they should make sure that you don't have
invidious discrimination,
Q

The rule of construction to which X referred was

sort of based upon the hypothesis that Congress would consider
the Constitution before it enacted legislation.

14
MR. LEVIN:
Q

Yes, well —

That was the basis of that rule of statutory

construction, that the Congress could read the Constitution
as well as other people.
MR. LEVIN:

Appellants in this case would say that

apparently the Congress did not pay too much attention to the
Constitution in enacting these particular provisions.
Q

The petitioner was a volunteer or was drafted into

the Amy?
MR. LEVIN:

Petitioner was, in a sense, a volunteer.

She — the Air Force put her through some portion of her
schooling and in return she was obligated to serve in the Air
Force.

So, six of one and half a dozen of another.
I would say that probably a volunteer.
I have used more time than I should have.

I would

like for Professor Ginsburg to speak to the appellants7
respective position of strict review that she is going to argue
and felt that it was essential in this case that she be given
an opportunity to present all argument to the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrs. Ginsburg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. GINSBURG:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

15
Amicus vieris this case as kin to Reed v. Reed, 404
U.S.
The legislative judgment in both derives frora the
same stereotype, the man is, or should be, the independent
partner in a marital unit.

The woman, with an occasional

exception, is dependent, sheltered from breadwinning experience.
Appellee stated in answer to interrogatories in this
case that they remained totally uninformed on the application
of this stereotype to service families; that is, they do not
know whether the proportion of wage -earning wives of service­
men is small, large or middle-siscd,
What is known is that,by employing the sex criterion,
identically situated persons are treated differently, ■ The
married serviceman gets benefits for himself, as well as his
spouse, regardless of her income.

The married service woman

is denied medical care for her spouse and quarters allowance
for herself,as well as her spouse, even if, as in this case,
she supplies over two-thirds the support of the marital unit.
For these reasons, amicus believes that the sexrelated means employed by Congress fails to meet the rationality
standard.

It does not have a fair and substantial relationship

to the legislative objective, so that all similarly circumstanced
persons shall be treated alike.
Nonetheless, amicus urges the Court to recognise in
this case what it has in others, that it writes not only for this

16

case, and this day alone, but for this type of case.
As was apparent from the decisions cited at pages
27 through 34 of our brief, in lower Federal, as well as State
Courts, the standard of review in sex discrimination cases is,
to say the least, confused.
A few courts have ranked that as a suspect criterion.
Others, including, apparently, the court below in this case,
seem to regard the Reed decision as a direction to apply
minimal scrutiny, and there are various shades between.
The result is that in many instances the same, or
similar, issues are decided differently, depending upon the
Court*s view of the stringency of review appropriate.
To provide the guidance so badly needed, and because
recognition is long overdue, Amicus urges the Court to declare
sex a suspect criterion.
This would not be quite the giant step appellees
suggest.
As Professor Gunther observed in an analysis of last
termh Equal Protection decisions published in the November 1972
Harvard Law Review, it appears that in Reed some special
suspicion of sex, as a classifying factor, entered into the
Court’s analysis.
Appellees concede that the principal ingredient in­
voking strict scrutiny is present in the sex criterion.
Sex, like race, is a visible, immutable characteristic

17
bearing no necessary relationship to a body.
Sex, like race, has been made the basis for unjusti­
fied, or at least unproved assumptions, concerning an
individual's potential to perform or to contribute to society.
But, appellees point out that although the
essential ingredient rendering a classification suspect is
present, sex based distinctions, unlike racial distinctions,
do not have an especially disfavored constitutional history.
It is clear that the core purpose of the Fourteenth
Amendment was to eliminate invidious racial discrimination.
But, why did the framers of the Fourteenth Amend­
ment regard racial as odious?

Because a person's skin color

bears no necessary relationship to ability.

Similarly, as

appellees concede, a person's sex bears no necessary relation­
ship to ability.
Moreover, national origin and aliens have been
recognized as suspect classifications, although the newcomer
to our shores was not the paramount concern of the nation
when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.
But the main thrust of the argument against recog­
nition of sex as a suspect criterion, centers on two points.
First, women are a majority.
Second, legislative classification by sex does not,
it is asserted, imply the inferiority of women.
With respect to the numbers argument, the numerical

18
majority was denied even the right to vote until 1920,
Women today face discrimination in employment, as
pervasive and more subtle than discrimination encountered by
minority groups.
In vocational and higher education, women continue
to face restrictive quarters, no longer operative with respect
to other population groups, their absence is conspicuous in
Federal and State legislative, executive and judicial chambers,
in higher Civil Service positions, and in appointed posts in
Federal, State and local government.
Surely, no one would suggest that race is not a
suspect criterion in the District of Columbia, because the
Black population here outnumbers the White.

Moreoverj as Mr* Justice

Douglas has pointed out

most recently in Hadley v. Alabama, 41 L.W. 3205, equal pro­
tection and due process of law apply to the majority as well
as to the minorities.
Do the sex classifications listed by appellees imply
a judgment of inferiority?
Even the court below suggested that they do.

That

court said it would be remiss if it failed to notice, looking
in the background, the subtle injury inflicted on service women,
the indignity of being treated differently, so many of them feel.
Sex classifications do stigmatize when, as in
Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S., the exclude women from an

19

occupation thought more appropriate to men.
The sex criterion stigmatizes when it is used to
limit hours of work for women only.

Hours regulations of the

kind involved in Muller v. Oregon, though perhaps reasonable
under turn of the Century conditions, today protect women from
competing for extra remuneration, higher paying jobs, promotions.
The sex criterion stigmatizes when, a3 in Hoyt v.
Florida, 368, U.S., it assumes that all women are preoccupied
with home and children and, therefore, should be spared the
basic civic responsibility of serving on a jury.
These distinctions have a common effect.

They help

keep woman in her place, a place inferior to that occupied by
men in our society.
Appellees recognize that there is doubt as to the
contemporary validity of the theory that sex classifications
do not brand the female sex as inferior, but they advocate a
hold-fche-line position by this Court unless and until the
Equal Rights Amendment comes into force.
Absent the Equal Rights Amendment, appellees assert,
no close scrutiny of sex based classifications is warranted.
This Court should stand pat on legislation of the
kind involved in this case, legislation making a distinction
service women regard as the most gross inequity, the greatest
irritant and the most discriminatory provision relating to
women in the military service.

20
But this Court has recognised that the notion of what
constitutes equal protection does change.
Proponents, as well as opponents, of the Equal Rights
Amendment,believe that clarification of the application of
equal protection to the sex criterion is needed and should come
from this Court.
Proponents believe that appropriate interpretation of
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments would secure equal rights
and responsibilities for men and women, but they also stress
that such interpretation was not yet discernible, And in any
event,the amendment would serve an important function in
removing even the slightest doubt that equal rights for men
and women is fundamental constitutional principle.
In asking the Court to declare sex a suspect criterion,
Amicus urges a position forcibly stated in 1837 by Sarah Grintey,
noted abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for men and
women.
She spoke, not elegantly, but with unmistakable
clarity.

She said, "I ask no favor for my sex.

All I ask of

our brethem is that they take their feet off our necks."
In conclusion, Amicus joins appellants in requesting
this Court to reverse the judgment entered below and remand the
case with instructions to grant the relief which is requested
in appellants complaint.
Thank you.

21
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Ginsburg.

Mr, Huntington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The position of the Government in this case is first,
that there is a rational basis for the different treatment of
male and female members of the Armed Forces in the statutes
here under review.
And, second, that the rational basis standard is the
proper standard for determining the validity of those statues.
I would like to first address myself to the statutes
and then discuss the appropriate standard of review.
I think it would be useful to begin by reviewing the
actual impact of the housing allowance and medical care statutes
here in issue.
The housing allowance statute is 37 U.S.C. 403 which
grants a basic housing allowance to each member of the military
for whom on-base housing is not available.
In addition, each such member is entitled to an
increased housing allowance if he has one or more dependents,
as defined by 37 U.S.C. 401.
f

Under the scale which is now in existence, for example,
a lieutenant in pay grade 2 would be entitled to $138.60 per

22
month for housing without dependents and $175.80 with dependents,
a difference of $37.20.
Now, the particular issue here, of course, concerns
under what circumstances a member of the Armed Forces may claim
a spouse as a dependent.

And, the general rule under the

statute is that wives of male members qualify automatically for
dependency benefits, whereas, husbands of female members
qualify only if dependent, in fact, on their wives for over
half their support.
Q

Does the housing allowance run right through all of

the commissioned and non-commissioned ranks?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
Q

Yes, it applies to everyone.

It varies in amount, I know,
MR.HUNTINGTON:

Yes.

I would like to point out, first —
Q

Except those for whom housing is provided by the

Government,for the person and his or her family.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes, right.

I would like to point out that under —
Q

As you put it, discrimination is against the man, is

that it?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

I didn’t mean to imply that —

(laughter)
I would like to point out that the — that under 37
U.S.C. 420, in the case of an interservice marriage, neither the

23

husband nor the wife may claim his or her spouse as a dependent.
Now, this fact has considerable importance here, for
a significant majority of married women in the Armed Forces
are married to military men.
Now, while the record is silent on this matter, the
Senate report issued on the proposals in Congress last year to
amend the statute contained a letter from the General Counsel
of the Department of Defense, which is in point.
In the letter, at page 4 of the report, that’s Senate
Report 921218, it is noted that a recently completed survey of
married women in the Air Force showed that 25% of the officers
were married, but that only 4% of the officers were married to
civilians.
And the percentage of all women in the Air Force
married to civilians is even smaller.
In not being able to claim their husbands as dependents,
military women married to military men are not discriminated
against since their husbands could not claim them either.
Similarly, a female member
Q

—

'The only way for the woman to get equality.is to put

her husband in the army, is that right?
MR, HUNTINGTON:

That would be one way, yes sir.

This is also true that these women married to military
men are not discriminated against with respect to medical benefits
because under 10 U.S.C. 1074, both the husband and the wife would

24

qualify for medical benefits.
Well, in short, then, the only «omen «ho tare treated
differently than their male counterparts are those women who
are married to civilians.
Now, in our view, one does not have to search far to
discover a rational basis for Congress* decision to treat
married men and married women differently with respect to
dependency benefits.
We start with the basic purpose of the two statutes,
and the basic purpose is to provide housing allowance and
medical benefits for dependents in order to establish a com­
pensation pattern which would attract career personnel into the
Armed Forces.
In Congress' vievs, this would enable the military to
compete with the civilian sector of the economy for married
people.
Nov», in establishing these benefits, Congress had to
determine what proof of dependency it would require.
Now, an examination of the statute shows that where
it was very likely that a military person would be supporting
certain relatives, dependency benefits were conferred automatic­
ally.

Where it would be less likely, or unusual, that a

military member would be supporting a person, proof of dependency
was required.
Also, under 37 U.8.C. 401, a serviceman5s wife and

25
minor children automatically qualify for dependency benefits.
Whereas, his older children and his parents mould qualify only
if dependent in fact.
And, since women generally do not provide the main
support for their husband, children or parents, service women
were required to establish dependency in fact in each case.
• .

*

Let me state this another way.

Taking the over

one million married military men as a group, a significant
majority of their wives are dependent on them.
Under these circumstances, it is rational to decide
to grant all married men dependency benefits for their wives
automatically, rather than undertaking the heavy administrafive
burden of determining dependency in fact in each case.
On the other hand, taking the one or two thousand
military women who are married to civilians, as a group, an
overwhelming majority of their husbands are not dependent upon
them.
Under these circumstances, it is rational to examine
individually the few instances where a military woman might have
a dependent husband.
a

Q

In regards to relationship, are you going to square

this with Reed v. Reed, I assume?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes, we think Reed v. Reed is

distinguishable.
Let me just address myself to the statistical basis

26
for our statement that the majority of women are dependent upon
their husbands.
The ACLU cites in their brief the fact that 60% of all
women living with their husbands are gainfully employed.
Well, the converse of this fact, of course, is that
40% of all married women are not employed.
Moreover, of those who work, as other figures cited
in the ACLU brief indicate, only a portion work full time.
In preparing for this argument, I looked at the —
Q

You mean like 90%, or what?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Or do you know what the «*-

Well, I think the figure in their

brief was that 43% of women are in the labor force, and 18%
work full time.
Q

18%.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

That’s at page 45 of the ACLU brief.

Now, in the Statistical Abstract of the United States,
which is a document which is cited in our brief, there is a table
that shows that in 1970, in white families where both the
husband and the wife work, and the husband is under 35, the mean
contribution of the wife to the total family income was 27.1%.
That's the table at page 327 of the Statistical Abstract.
In comparable black families, the mean contribution of
the wife was slightly higher, 33.4%.
In short, there can be no question but that husbands
still provide the primary income in most families.

In many

27
families, they provide the only income-

In the remaining

families, their aggragate contribution to the total family
income totally eclipses the aggragate contribution of working

wives.
Now, if that is true today, we submit that 23 years
ago and 17 years ago when these statutes here were passed it
was true to an even greater extent.
Now, on the other side of the coin, it can hardly
be disputed that most men are not dependent upon their wives.
As we note in our brief, almost all married men work,
and in families where both the husband and the wife work the
husband’s income is generally well above the wife’s.
Q

Is there some danger of fraud in this area?

Is

that part of the Government’s aim?
Let's assume that you are trying to determine if a
parent or older children are dependenti

Do you just take an

affidavit, or what do you do?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

They fill out a form listing their

expenses.
Q

That's the end of it, isn't it?

m. HUNTINGTON:
Q

I believe that probably is.

Is that the large administrative burden you are

talking about.
MR, HUNTINGTON:

Well, for a million and a half men

to have to examine a million and a half forms, I submit would be

28
an administrative burden.
-

Q

I agree it is a burden, but I am just trying to find

out how much of a burden it is.

If it is making an affidavit

and then somebody would have to read them.
MR. HUNTINGTON;

Making an affidavit and then somebody

reading it and making a determination as to whefcher it is
justified.

I think that is exactly what's involved.
I suppose if evidence came to the military's attention

that the affidavit was false, they would have to investigate
further.
Q

Wouldn’t it be the other?

How about letting the

women claim — you could treat women the same as men the other
way, I suppose.

MR. HUNTINGTON;

You mean deny them benefits

altogether, not even give them a chance to show —
Q

No, treat them like —
MR. HUNTINGTON;

Oh, treat them the way men — well,

certainly, Congress could do that.
Q

Save a whole lot of money that way.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

The proposal before Congress in the

last Congress and will probably be resubmitted this time is to
amend the statute to treat women exactly the same way.
What I am saying here is —

Q

Would that include a requirement to show dependency,

or would it be a presumption?

29
MR. HUNTINGTON:
Dependency

No, there would be no requirement.

benefits for spouse and minor children would be

conferred automatically noth on men and on women.
Q

The Senate bill would give the petitioners exactly

what they are asking for here?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes, that's right.

MR, HUNTINGTON:

But, we submit that while that may

be a good suggestion and Congress may adopt it, there is a
rational basis for the classification made in these statutes,
and that it is the different statistical characteristics of
married military men,as a group,compared with married military
women, as a group, which justify the different treatment here.
Q

Those statistics haven’t been consistent, I am sure,

have they?

For 40 years?

MR. HUNTINGTON:

Been consistent for 40 years?

No, —
Q

Of course.

They vary every year.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

The statistics I gave were for the

current year, or the last couple of years.
Q

And that was not what the statute was based on.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

The statute was based on the

situation 20 years ago.
Q

Is there any evidence in the legislative history that

they considered those factors?
MR, HUNTINGTON:

No, there is not.

The legislative

30
history simply indicates that the statute was designed to give

That women arc women and men are men.
Ml. HUNTINGTON:

Q

-- benefits for dependents.

Is there anything in the legislative history other

than there should be a distinction made between men and women
in the Armed Services?

Is there anything else in the legislative

history on this statute other than that?
MR. HUNTINGTON: Well, there is not even that.
statute speaks for itself on that point.

The

The only thing in the

legislative history is that by giving allowances for dependents
you would compensate military personnel better so that you could
compete with the civilian sector of the economy.
Now, I still say that it is apparent that Congress
wrestled with the question of how do you determine who is a
dependent, and that it was rational for them to determine that
in the case of men you assume that wives are dependent auto-*
maticaily because, treating the class of men as a whole, that
is generally true.

Treating the class of women, it is generally

not true.
Q

So you based it on the whole general class of women

and the whole general class of men, period.
MR. HUNTINGTON:
Q

Period, right.

But we submit that —

And that's a rational basis?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes.

We submit it is a rational

basis because there are statistical differences between the two

31
classes, which justify —
Q

And what statistical differences did Congress consider?

You said none.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

I said the legislative history

doesn't indicate that they looked at it.
history is fairly silent.

to find an underlying rational here.

The legislative

I think that this is

I don't believe that this is the type of

case where you have to strain your imagination to dream up
some conceivable rationale behind the statute.

I think the

rationale, as I have indicated, is one which, if it doesn't
leap at you from the statute, is one which is fairly apparent.
Q

What leaps at me is that women are women and men are

men and you can draw that difference and that difference only
and base money on it.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I would submit simply that

there are statistical differences here which do justify the
different treatment.

I

would like to turn now to the Reed v. Reed case.
»

*

•

In that case, as you will recall, the court reviewed an Idaho
statute which provided that when competing applications to
administer an estate were filed by a man and a woman in the
same priority group, the man was to be given preference
and appointed.
Now, there was no evidence in the record that men, as

32
a class, were better administrators than women, and the court
rejected the contention that the measure was justified to save
litigation costs.
In short, there are no differences in the two classes
of applicants, men and women, which justify the discrimination.
By contrast, there are very real and relevant
statistical differences between married military men, as a
class, and married military women, which justify -- in our view
justify — the classifications under review in this case.
I would like to turn now to the question of the
appropriate standard to be applied under the Due Process clause
of the Fifth Amendment to determine the validity of these
statutes.
To begin with, as this Court has held in numerous
cases, traditional principles of equal protection developed
under the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant in considering
attacks under the Fifth Amendment, alleging that Federal
statutes unjustifiably discriminate between difference classes
of individuals.
How, as already has been touched upon here today,
the traditional equal protection test is the rational basis
test.

Although originally developed in cases involving statutes

regulating business, the test has been applied in recent years
to cases involving economic and social benefits.
Now, as both Mr. Levin and Professor Ginsburg have

33

pointed out, the Court has imposed a stricter standard of
review with respect to statutory classification in two types
of cases, those involving classifications which affect funda­
mental personal rights and those involving inherently suspect
classifications.
As far as the personal rights are concerned, 1 would
disagree with Mr. Levin that personal rights of the type which
bring into play this standard are involved here.
The rights are to dependency benefits.

These are the

same type of economic benefits which were under review in the
Dandridge case, and I think it is not the type of personal
i

rights which were under consideration in the Weber case which
Involved the relationship between illegitimate children and
legitimate children within the family unit.
So we would say that the strict view, if it is going
to apply at all in this case, it must be because sex is a
suspect classification.
Let me just comment briefly on Professor Gunther’s
article in the Harvard Law Review.

He suggested there that, in

recent cases, this Court has not been limited simply to ond of
the polar extremes, but that in reviewing statutes,the Court
has been taking a fairly close look, even when applying the
rational basis test, to determine whether there is in fact some
Government interest Involved which can -- which Is readily
apparent and you don't have to stretch the imagination to come

34

up with it.
We would submit that in this case the classification
here would stand scrutiny under that type of approach.
I would like now to turn to Professor Ginsburg’s
argument that classifications based on sex are 3'aspect for
equal protection and due process purposes.
To begin with, as Professor Ginsburg acknowledges,
this Court has never treated classifications based on sex as
inherently suspect, and only last term,in Reed v, Reed, applied
the traditional rational basis test.
In our view, the Court should not now abandon the
traditional test and treat sex classifications as suspect.
Just last week, in the Cross decision, which upheld
the $50 filing fee requirement as a precondition to discharge
in bankruptcy,the Court referred to the suspect criteria of
race, nationality and alienage.
Now, race classifications, of course, have an
especially disfavored status in our constitutional history, and
each of the three classifications, in the words of Justice
Blackmun in Graham v. Richardson, involves, and I quote, "a
discreet and insular minority for whom heightened judicial
solicitude is appropriate.”
Now, these minorities generally lack the political
power to protect their own interests.
We are not contending that women have achieved equal

35
political power with men.
The statistics cited by Professor Ginsburg as to the
number of women in high government positions and State and
Federal legislatures are certainly not in dispute, and they
are very small.
What we do suggest is that because they are a
numerical majority in the population as a whole they have been
exercising substantial and growing political influence upon
State and Federal legislatures.
At the Federal level, as summarised in the ACLU’s
brief, there has been considerable legislative activity in
amending statutes containing classifications based on sex.
Proposed legislation to amend these statutes, as I
have already stated, was before Congress last year and
undoubtedly will be before Congress this year.
And, also, of course, the Equal Rights Amendment,
which was passed last year is evidence -- is an indication of
the influence

women who favor the amendment have been able

to exert.
There is another reason for not expanding the category
of suspect classifications to include women.

Unlike classi­

fications based on race, nationality or alienage, classifications
based on sex frequently are not arbitrary but reflect actual
differences between the sexes which are relevant to the
purposes of the statutes containing the classifications.

36

Nov;, we contend here that the dependency statutes,
for example, do not discriminate against women because of their
femininity.

They treat women differently because women,as a

class,are less likely to have dependents than men.
Similarly, the Florida statute upheld in Hoyt v.
Florida, did not excuse women from jury duty because they were
inferior but excused them because of the fact that women, as a
class, were more likely than men to have family responsibilities
making it impractical for them to serve as jurors.
Application of the rational basis test permits the
courts to consider statues on a case by case basis to determine
which classifications are based on valid factual or physiological
differences between the sexes, and which classifications, like
the one struck down in Reed and Reed,are arbitrary and not based
on sex differences.
On the other hand, denominating sex classifications
as suspect would subject all statutes containing sex classi­
fications to strict review, and could result in invalidating
many of them, whether or not individual classifications reflect
acknowledged factual or physiological differences.
Q

When you talk about the generality of women being less

likely to have dependents, you mean dependents in this narrow
sense, financially?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
dependents

Dependents, as defined -- yes,

37

Q

In terns of children -~
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Mo, in terms of dependent spouses,

is what I mean.
Well, in closing, let me simply state that we have
no quarrel with the drive of many women to achieve equality by
attacking statutes enacted in a different era that may reflect
antiquated notions of the respective roles of the sexes.
We submit, however, that the plea for across-the-board
change, rather than case by case consideration, is better
addressed to the legislatures rather than to the courts.
In conclusion, the judgment of the District Court
should be affirmed.
Thank you.
Q

Could I ask you, if we agree with the other side,

what do you understand the consequence would be?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

I understand the consequence would be

that you would extend the same benefits to women.
Q

I think —

What would we strike down?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

You would strike down the portion of

the statute which says that women have to establish dependency,
in fact, in order to claim their husband as —
Q

If we strike that provision down which provides for

their allowance, how do they get the allowance?
MR* HUNTINGTON:

You would only strike down as far

as it requires them to establish dependency in fact in order

Q

If you didn’t strike down the discrimination, the other

way of doing it would be to say that

is that no one must

prove dependency.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

I would think that would definitely

not be the preferable alternative.
Q

I didn't say it was preferable.

I wondered how do

you know which one —

be what Congress would have wished had it been faced with the
situation of not being able to make this classification.

If we just strike down that particular part of a

statute, of a provision, just those particular words?

statutes to mean men and women wherever it says men, or -MR. HUNTINGTON:

So we would strike down one statute and rework some

others, or at least —
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, no, just within the definition

same standard had to apply to women as applies to men,
Q

Why couldn’t we just as easily say that since the

allowance **- if that were the conclusion -- is discriminatory,
all allowances are stricken?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I think that would fly right

in the face of the purpose of Congress in adopting the
dependency statutes to begin with.
Q

Any more so than except as to numbers?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I think numbers are quite

*

relevant when you are talking about a million and a hulf men
and only a couple of a thousand women married to civilians.
Q

You don't want us to strike the allowances for men?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

No, we don't want you to strike that

and we don't want you to require that the men's applications
for dependency allowances be examined —
Q

Well, in Section 401 of the definition, says that a

dependent of a member of the service is one, his spouse,

two,

his unmarried minor child, and then down below it says, however,
a person is not a dependent of a female member unless lie is
in fact dependent on her for over half his support.
Now, what do we strike down?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
Q

That sentence.

Then there are no provisions for a man being a

dependent, because up above it is his spouse.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I think his means her in this

40
context.
(laughter)
Q

Obviously9 if it is unconstitutional to discriminates

it must, is that it?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, the statute has always been

construed —
Q

Well, it doesn’t, it isn’t though.

That means his.

It means his because it treats the other one —
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, take the next one, his un­

married legitimate child.
Q

So you do have to change the meaning of his in one,

don’t we?
We have to make it his or her.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

If you want to do a complete job,

you could do it, but the way —
(laughter)
— but the way the statute has been construed, his
is interchangeable with her there.
Q

Can we assume that the petitioners in this case are

not in favor of cutting out all of the allowances that the
wives get?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

You can certainly assume that, and

we are not suggesting that you do that.
Thank you*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have three minutes left.

41
Mr. Levin, if you wish to use it.
Q

How would you answer Mr. Justice White's question?
MR. LEVIN:

About which provision of the statute should

be struck?
Q

Rewritten.
MR. LEVIN:

First of all, I don't think you get into

any trouble by striking that portion that begins "however”
and ends "support."
Q

Why ?
MR. LEVIN:

Because I don't believe that his means

his in the masculine —
Q

It means that now, doesn't it?
MR. LEVIN:

No, sir, it doesn't mean it now, because

the only limitation you have is down here, "is not a dependent
of a female member," unless he is, in fact, dependent on her
for over one-half his support.
Q

What page of what document?
MR. LEVIN:

I am looking at page 23(a) of the

Appendix, last paragraph.
But I certainly wouldn't construe his in the masculine
or feminine sense —
Q

Back up one sentence.

That's what we are really

talking about.
MR. LEVIN:

I believe that that would extend the

benefits to all, yes, sir.

42
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. LEVIS!, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEVIN:

I think the Government has misconstrued

the basic question here, and the basic purpose of the statutes.
The basic purpose of these statutes, and the legis»
lative history shows this, is to extend these benefits to men
and women.

That's the language that the legislature used,

and the proponents of the legislation used, and the idea was
to encourage re-enlistment of men and women.
And-it is said more than once, and that is the legis­
lative history, anything anything else would be inconsistent
with the basic purpose of the statutes.

I

think we lose sight of the issue that no matter how

many figures are thrown up to the court, that, nevertheless,
you get right down to rock bottom, women who are identically
situated to men, as in the case of Lieutenant Frontiero, don't
receive either housing benefits or medical benefits, and there
can be no justification for that kind of situation.
The Government talked in terms of forms that have to
be filled out.

I

know from military experience that there are

a hundred forms that have to be filled out when you go in* ::v<u ,
..{ ju;.

Men, all service people, have to inform the

Government as to how many dependents they have, and a variety
of other items, In order to determine initially what kind of
payments they might be eligible to receive.

43
So you are not asking for any — if you extend it
all the way around, you certainly wouldn’t be asking for any
extension.

You would just have to acquire a quality of proof,

if you prefer to call it that.
The Senate bill that has been discussed by the
Government, of course, is speculative, and its only prospective,
as I read it, would not apply whatsoever to assist Lieutenant
Frontiero and her husband.
I think in Reed v. Reed that the lower court there
talked in terms of a difference in the experience of men and
women and attempted to justify the classification that way.
Well, statistics in that case could just as easily
have shown that there are more men in this world than there
are women and, consequently, they have more experience, so
the classification would then be justified, once again, under
the administrative convenience justification.
I think you get into a problem when you try and ask
the question: what is the definition of dependency?
The Government seems to x$ant to use one «half dependent
in the case of women who are seeking to have their husbands as
dependents, but to:use another classification,that is, just
general dependency or breadwinning in the case of men.
And we think that this cannot in any way be justified.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.

Thank you.
