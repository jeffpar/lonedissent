PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We will hear arguments
next in 71-666, United States against Glaxo Group»
Mr. Friedman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a government civil antitrust case here on
direct appeal to the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, which presents two basically unrelated
issues.
The first issue is whether, in a civil antitrust
case, the government may challenge the validity of patents
which, although not relied upon by the defendants as a
defense to the antitrust charge are, nevertheless, involved
in the antitrust violations in the case; and the second
issue is whether the relief given by the district court in
this case was inadequate.
The appellees, the Glaxo Group Limited, and Imperial
Chemical Industries, Inc., which I shall refer to as ICI, are
two British drug firms.
The drug involved in this case is an antibiotic
called "griseofulvin".

Griseofulvin itself is an old product

and it's unpatented, and for many years it was used as a

4

fungicide in the treatment of fungus infections of plants»
In the 1950's», ICI discovered that if griseofulvin
was taken internally it would be able to cure various fungus
infections, such as ringworms, on the skin of people and
animals.

And, as a result of these discoveries, in 1959 ICI

obtained a patent upon this new use of the drug.
The patent contained two basic claims.

The first

was a so-called method claim which consisted of a method of
curing external fungus infections of animals and people by
the administration of what theydescribed as an effective
amount of griseofulvin.

The second claimw as a so-called

product claim, it was described as a pill, capsule, or
container containing an effective amount of griseofulvin
which would accomplish this objective.
And this is the basic patent, these two claims,
which the government is here challenging.
In 1967, the other appellee, Glaxo, obtained a
United States patent on an improved form of griseofulvin,
the so-called microsise form of the drug, which is very much
ground up into very small particles, which has proven to be
much more effective than the original form, and which is the
one now of principal commercial significance.
Between 1957 and I960, the two appellees had
extensive discussions, looking to a pooling of their patents
and cross-licensing.

And in 1960 they reached such an

5

agreement under which the patents on griseofulvin of the
two companies were pooled, and they cross-licensed each
other.
And in addition to that, in this agreement ICI
agreed that it would use its best endeavors to make sure that
its licensees did not sell griseofulvin in bulk to third
persons without the consent of Glaxo,
In 1962, ICI appointed the American Home Products
Corporation, an American firm, as its exclusive distributor
of griseofulvin.

It previously had appointed this firm as

its exclusive distributor for other drugs.

And in its

license to American Home Products, it required an agreement
that American Home Products, in turn, would not sell this
drug in bulk to any third persons without the written
permission of ICI.
Shortly before this, Glaxo had granted similar —
made a similar agreement with two other American firms,
Schering Corporation and Johnson & Johnson, appointing them
as distributors for the drug griseofulvin in the United
States; and the agreements of Glaxo with these two licensees
similarly provided that the licensees could not sell in
bulk without the written approval of the licensor.
Each of these agreements gave the people crosslicenses under the patents.

That is, Glaxo license under

its own and ICI's patents? ICI license under its and the Glaxo

6

patents.
And each of these was in the form of a patent licen­
sing agreement.

That is, in addition to the bulk sales

restriction, the basic agreement was they licensed them to
manufacture and sell under the patents, and each of the
licensees

was required to pay a royalty to the licensor,

based upon the total amount of the griseofulvin which they
purchased from the English firm and sold.
Now, although the licenses permitted the American
firms to manufacture, the fact is that throughout this
entire period all three of the American licensees purchased
all of their griseofulvin from the English firms.
During this entire period, neither Glaxo nor ICI
made any bulk sales to anyone other- than the three licensees,
and the three licensees themselves made no bulk sales at all
to anyone in the United States.
Shortly before this suit was filed, when the appellees
were informed that the Justice Department was investigating
the legality of these bulk sales restrictions, they cancelled
them.
Since that time American Home Products Corporation
has made a few sales of the griseofulvin, not in bulk but
in the capsule form.
Now, when this government suit was filed in March
1968, the three licensees together had 100 percent of the

7
marketo

And at the time the record was closed, a couple of

years later, they had 98,5 percent of the market.
The government suit alleged that the bulk sales
limitations contained in the licenses and also in the ICIGlaxo patent pooling arrangement violated Section 1 of the
Sherman Act.
The government complaint also challenged the ICI
patent on two grounds.

We contended that the method patent

was invalid because it did not disclose how to practice the
invention, since it nowhere stated what was an effective
amount of griseofulvin, and of course the patent, the idea
that was patented was the administration of an effective
amount necessary to cure these diseases. And we said that
•1

all it said was an effective amount, and that didn't suffici­
ently disclose the method of practice in the invention, so
that when the patent ultimately expires this patented
information will be available to the public.
QUESTION:

This was in the complaint?

MR. FRIEDMAN: This was in the complaint, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION: And why, in the complaint, did the
government challenge the validity of the patent?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, we didn’t spell out in the
complaint, but we said that these patents were invalid and
the theme —
QUESTION: This was perhaps in anticipation of their

8

relying on the patent to justify the restriction, or what?
MR. FRIEDMANi

No, they had not relied on the patent.

No, our basic theory, Mr. Justice, was that we have the right,
in an antitrust case, where we allege and claim that the
patents are involved in the violation, we have the right, as
an incident to that antitrust suit, to challenge the violation.
Of course, here our allegation is that these bulk
sales restrictions were invalid and these, of course, were
part of the patent licensing agreement.
Nov?, we also challenged the so-called product
claim on the ground that all this was was the new use of a
well-known product, and that you couldn't get a product claim
on that, that that could only be patented under the method
claim.
There was not, in this case, a trial in the
traditional sense. The case was decided on various motions
for partial summary judgment.

However, an extensive record

was produced, it occupies better than 400 pages in this

Court,

and extensive facts were developed through affidavits, through
depositions, through stipulations, through various documents.
The district court held that the ban upon the sales
of bulk of the griseofulvin in both the patent licensing
agreements and the cross-licensing agreements was a per se
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, because, under
this Court's decision in the Schwinn case, in 388 U.S., it

9
was an impermissible restraint by the manufacturer upon
alienation.

That is, the manufactur parted with all his title

and control over the property when he sold it to the American
licensees, and he could not thereafter control the disposition
made by the American licensees.
The district court, however, struck from the
complaint the allegations with respect to the invalidity of
the patents.

The court said that the government had no

standing to litigate this issue, and there were two grounds
of its decision — really, one ground. What it said was:
as it interpreted the prior decisions of this Court, the
government may challenge the validity of a patent only in
two circumstances:

one, where it is alleged that the patent

has been obtained by fraud on the Patent Office *— and there
was no such claim here; two, where the defendants rely
upon the patent as a defense to the antitrust case. And since
the defendants here had expressly — at least one of them,
ICX had disavowed the reliance on the patent; it concluded
that the government had no standing.
And consistent with that decision, it also
denied the government's motion to file an amended complaint
which, among other things, would have also challenged the
validity of the later Glaxo patent.
The judgment the district court entered in this case
prohibits the appellees from participating in, adhering,

10
enforcing in any way any agreement: prohibiting or limiting
the resale in bulk of not only griseofulvin but of all drugs
that it sells in the United STates.
The district court, however, refused to grant two
other provisions which the government asserted was essential
to dissipate the effects of this illegal conduct. That is,
we saids

in addition to that the court should order the

appellees themselves to grant licenses in bulk as long as they
sold in the United States on reasonable, non-discriminatory
terms; and in addition we urged that they should be required
to grant licenses under their patents at reasonable royalties.
And I will discuss the facts relating to the need
£or this relief when I come to discuss the relief portions of
the case,
Now, under this Court's decision in the Gypsum case,
there's no question that if the defendants rely upon a patent
as a defense to an antitrust case involving patents, the
government then has standing to challenge the patents.
In the Gypsum case, what happened was that the
government alleged that an industrywide price-fixing system,
resulting from a series of patent licenses, violated the
Sherman Act,
The defendants in that case admitted that if their
patents didn't provide a defense, their conduct was illegal,
but they asserted that the patents did provide a defense.

11
At that point tha government then moved to amend
the complaint, to challenge the validity of the patents.
The district court, refused to permit the government
to do that, saying that if you permitted the government in an
antitrust suit to challenge the validity of patents, that
would involve a collateral attack upon the decision of the
Commissioner of Patents granting a patent, and that the
statutes do not permit such collateral attack.
When the case came to this Court on the government's
appeal, the Court said it was actually unnecessary to decide
that issue, because it concluded that what the defendants
had done in that case could not be justified by their
patents; but it said that because of the significance of the
issue, it was unwise to leave that holding as a precedent, and
therefore took pains to correct it.
And I would like to read to the Court the ground on
which this Court held that the district court had erred in
Gypsum in saying the government couldn’t rely on the patents.
It's in 333 U.S., at pages 387 to 388.

The Court said:

"In an antitrust suit instituted by a licensee against his
licensor we have repeatedly held that the licensee may attack
the validity of the patent under which he was licensed" — and
now I stress these words — "because of the public interest
in free competition, even though the licensee has agreed in
his license not to do so."

12
That is the public interest in free competition
method, even though the licensee had said he wouldn’t attack
the patent? nevertheless he should be given the right to do
so.
And the Court then concluded:

"In a suit to

vindicate the public interest by enjoining violations of the
Sherman Act," — that is a suit to vindicate the public
interest as distinguished from the private interest involved
in the private suit — "the United States should have the
same opportunity to show that the asserted shield of
patentability does not exist."
Wow, of course, as our opponents argue vigorously,
this is a different case, because here they haven't relied
upon the patents as a defense, but we think the basic
rationale of that case, and the whole theory of all of this
Court's decisions dealing with the interrelationship of
patents and the antitrust laws calls for the same result in
this case.
This Court, in recent years, has frequently
recognized, as it said in Lear v. Adkins, the important public
interest in permitting free and full competition in the use
of ideas, which are in reality a part of the public domain,
and the strong federal policy favoring that interest.

And

in Lear v. Adkins, it also referred to the public's interest
in the elimination of specious patents

13
This concept is nothing new.

Eighty years ago,

in a case called Pope Manufacturing v. Gormully, this Court
stated, and I will quote, "It is as important to the public
that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents,
as that the patentee of a really valuable invention should be
protected in his monopoly."
Now, in the patent laws, Congress has provided that
inventors are to be rewarded with a monopoly for seventeen years <,
And this, of course, is designed to encourage invention, to
see that people who make significant contributions get the
financial rewards thereof.
However, Congress has provided rather explicit and
specific conditions that have to be met before a patent can
be granted.

There are, of course, the standards of

inventiveness, non-obviousness, the fact that the invention
cannot be patentable if it was made public more than a year
before the application is filed, and also certain things
that are involved in this case as to what has to be disclosed
in the patent application.
Now, if these requirements are not met, it's
clearly, we think — and this Court has recognized — it's
in the public interest that such a patent be invalidated.
The patent monopoly, of course, and for very valid
reasons, is an exception to the basic principle of free
competition that is reflected in the Sherman Act.

The Court

14
itself so stated in the Lear case.
Therefore, in the light of that fact that it is an
exception to the policy of free competition, we think it is
important that the patent monopoly only exist when the specific
terms Congress has provided for it in fact are satisfied.
The purpose of a government antitrust suit, of
course, is to eliminate restraints upon competition.

By

definition, an invalid patent, one that has not met the
standards Congress has provided, involves precisely an
impermissible restraint of that type.
We therefore think it is appropriate that when the
government brings an antitrust suit, in which the patents
are involved, that it should be permitted in that suit also
to challenge the patents.

Because such a challenge furthers

the basic principle of the lawsuit.

That is, the purpose of

the Attorney General in bringing a suit under the antitrust
laws is to eliminate restraints on competition.
And where a patent is involved in an antitrust
violation, that is a restraint also on competition and one
which furthers and, in effect, strengthens the basic restraint
arising under the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

Would it not follow, Mr. Friedman, that
i

the government could bring a civil antitrust suit against any
patentee, claiming that since his patent was invalid, then
he was an illegal monopolist under the antitriist laws?

15
MR. FRIEDMAN: As a matter of logic, Mr. Justice,
certainly? and in the court below we argued this case on
alternative theories.

We argued that general theory and we

also argued, as we’ve explained in our reply brief, the
narrower theory, that here the patents were involved in the
antitrust violations.

In this Court we have not abandoned

the position maintained below, but we have brought the case
to this Court on the narrow ground because we think in this
case, we think that in this case here the patents were
involved.
QUESTION:

Well, they were not in issue in any

sense of the word, they were not one of the issues to be
determined in this litigation, the way the issues were framed
*

by the ultimate pleadings, isn't that true?
MR. FRIEDMAN; Well, they

were not in issue only

because —
QUESTION:

They were not relied upon by the

defendants.
MR. FRIEDMAN: They were not relied upon by the
defendants.
QUESTION: Therefore they were not one of the issues
to be determined in the antitrust litigation.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, except, Mr. Justice, that we
did make an allegation that the patents were invalid,
QUESTION: Well, as I say, then it would follow, it

16

would seem to me as a matter of logic that you could bring an
antitrust suit against any patentee claiming that his patent
was invalid and therefore his exercise of a monopoly violated
the antitrust laws.
MR. FRIEDMANs Well, it would not — the mere fact,
Mr. Justice, that the patent is invalid would not be enough
to establish a violation of the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

Because —

The patent confers upon the patentee or

his assignee the right to exercise monopolistic rights,
with respect to the patent, for the number of years.
MR. FRIEDMAN? Monopoly in the colloquial sense,
Mr. Justice? but this Court held in the Walker Process case
that that in itself was not enough to establish a violation of
Section 2.
That is, the mere fact that you have an invalid
patent and enforce it, if the patent is subsequently invalidated,
that is not enough to establish a violation of Section 2.
And therefore, in that kind of a case, in that kind of a case
we would not be able to show that the patent was involved
in an independent antitrust violation.
I concede that as a matter of logic the policy
arguments I have made would point to the direction that we
can challenge it in every case.

But that's an issue that

does not have to be faced in this case, we think, Mr. Justice,
because in this case we think the patents are involved in the

17
antitrust violations.
And let me explain just briefly, if I may, why we
think that is so.

These patents basically, we think, were the

foundation upon which the illegal bulk sales prohibition
rested.
To begin with, the restriction is contained in the
patent licensing agreements.

The agreement between Glaxo

and ICI or the original agreement which involved the pooling
of patents and the cross-licensing itself was the first time
in which Glaxo insisted that ICI should prevent its
licensees from selling in bulk.
Now, the thing that —
QUESTION:

Would you say, then, that what you've

been arguing you would not argue in a treble-damage case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

We would not argue?

Yes.

Did you say you would or wouldn't?

I thought you said something about —
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I thought Mr. Justice Stewart's
question did not relate —
QUESTION:

Yes, but I was turning to a different

one.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

I was turning to a different one.

MR. FRIEDMAN: You're asking a different one?
QUESTION:

Yes.

18

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I would think — you mean if

the government or a private party were bringing a trebledamage case?
QUESTION:

A private party bringing —

MR. FRIEDMAN:
party would, Mr. Justice.

No, I would not think that a private
I don't —

QUESTION: Why?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Because of the role

the Attorney

General has in this case.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but I thought — I thought
the theory of the treble-damage suit was private Attorney
General.
QUESTION: Well, what if the licensee were sued by
the patentee here to enforce the license agreement?
Do you think the licensee could answer and say.
Well, by the way, you patent’s invalid.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, certainly? certainly, Mr.

Justice, if —
QUESTION: Well, what if it were then?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That would be — he could challenge.

QUESTION? And how about treble damages?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think that if — well, the

treble damages would have to be based on -QUESTION:

On an antitrust violation.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

— a violation of the antitrust laws.

19

QUESTION:

Which is on the -- which you say appears

on the face of the license agreement?
MR. FRIEDMAN: It's been so held, yes.

The violation

of the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But you would not be entitled to

get treble damages on the basis of invalidating the patent.
Treble damages could be obtained for the violations of the
antitrust laws that were found.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same
day. ]

20

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue, Mr.

Friedman.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When the Court rose, there was discussion about the
relationship between this suit and private litigation, and I
would just like to come back to that a minute if I may.
Because we think it is somewhat anomalous that the government
is denied the right to challenge patents in an antitrust suit
that are involved in the violation, where it is asserting
the public interest.

Yet, it's well settled that in

private suits, private parties in many situations have
standing to challenge the validity of patents.
For example, if a patent licensee is sued for
infringement or if a person is sued for infringement, or a
patent licensee is sued for royalties, he always has the
right to assert as a defense that the patent is invalid.
QUESTION:

That isn't very historic, is it?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's not historic, but it's a principle

that this Court has long since recognized, Mr. Justice,
And, indeed, it goes a little bit — it goes beyond that, it
seems to us.

It goes beyond that because under the patent

misuse doctrine the courts of equity will frequently deny

21
their processes to bar enforcement of a patent, not where
there has been a violation of the antitrust laws as such, but
even where the patentee has engaged in anticompetitive
conduct.

And we think that in the light of that subtle

practice when dealing with the rights to challenge patents
in private suits, certainly the government should have no
lesser interest when it is suing to protect the public
interest,
And in —
QUESTION: Well, is there any indication in these
cases that without the condition against bulk sales there
would have been no license?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Or do you just infer that?

There's no such indication, but it

does appear, Mr. Justice — I mean, the limitation was a
part of the patent licensing agreement.
QUESTION: Evidently it was, but it was negotiated —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Presumably.

Presumably one of the

conditions for the patent license is that they accepted this
restriction.

And, indeed, the fact that the appellees

considered this restriction so important I think is shown by
the fact that when they had their cross-licensing agreement
they agreed that ICI would impose this restriction upon its
licensee.
So that it seems to us that this whole thing was
part of the single transaction.

And I just may refer in this

22
connection, to point out that the position we are advocating
here would fully accord with this Court's statement only last
term in the Blender-Tongue case, recognition that this Court's
decisions do encourage authoritative testing of patent
validity*
And there's one final point to make:

in this

particular situation, if the government is not permitted to
challenge these patents, it's unlikely that anyone else will.
And of course, in permitting challenges by licensees, this
Court has stressed that frequently the licensee is the only
one who has an interest in challenging*
Now, in this case, certainly the three licensees
who have had the benefit of what I shall come to when I
discuss the relief, of basically a non-competitive, highly
concentrated market, there’s no reason to think they would
have any incentive to challenge the patents.

And the people

who are trying to get into this market are the small generic
drug manufacturers who don't sell under brand names, they
are small companies, the market itself is not an overwhelmingly
large one, and they would have no interest to challenge it.
Now, what is the basic position that the appellees
urge as to why we shouldn't have this power?
First of all, they tell us that, Well, you don't
come within Gypsum because we have not relied on the patents
as a defense

23

Well# Gypsum# of coursea, merely held that where the
government — where the defendants do rely on the patents as a
defense, the government can challienge the patents.

It didn't

at all deal with the question where# if the patents are not
relied on as a defense, whether the government can challenge
them nonetheless if they're involived in antitrust violations.
And then — I will come to it in one minute# but I
just want to say here at the outset that basically we don't
think they make any convincing policy arguments as to why
the government should not be able to do this.

Their major

argument# and# indeed, the principal reliance of the
district court was on this Court"s decision in the Bell
Telephone case# 75 years ago.
The Bell Telephone case

was a suit in which the

government challenged certain of the Bell Telephone patents
as having been obtained by fraud on the Patent Office, by
alleged misrepresentations# and we brought a suit to cancel
the patents.
The circuit court held that the government had not
*

proven fraud, and dismissed the suit# and this Court affirmed
the dismissal, saying that the wJhole theory of the government
that these people had failed to imove with sufficient dispatch
before the Patent Office# that therefore they were extending
the life of the patent and the protection of the patent.
They said that is not fraud within the rule that permits the

24
government to challenge a patent — to cancel a patent for
fraud.
And then the Court went on and commented on a
statement made in an earlier decision involving the Bell case,
which, it suggested that the government could also perhaps
challenge a patent for a mistake on the part of the patent
official's bad judgment and so on.
What the Court said was that in making the statement
in the earlier case it was not intending to suggest or state
that — and this is the quote — the courts of the United
States, sitting as courts of equity, could entertain
jurisdiction of a suit by the United States to set aside a
patent for an invention on the mere ground of error of
judgment on the part of the patent officials.

That would be

an attempt on the part of the courts, in collateral attack,
to exercise an appellate jurisdiction over the decisions
of the Patent Office, although no appellate jurisdiction has
been, by the statute, conferred.
Now, to begin with, the rationale that, was announced
in the Bell Telephone case, that permitting the government to
maintain such a suit would amount to an impermissible
collateral attack on the Patent Office, that is the identical
theory upon which the district court in Gypsum refused to
permit the government to challenge the patent, and one which
we think this Court implicitly rejected in its Gypsum decision.

25

And of course, as a practical matter, patents are
challenged, and the decisions of the Patent Commissioner are
reviewed all the time in the courts of this country, because
what happens is, whenever there's a patent suit and the patent
is challenged, the district court, in determining whether the
patent is valid or invalid, to that extent reviews the
decision of the Commissioner of Patents.
QUESTION: And that's because without the patent the
case, on one side or the other, falls?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, but I'm suggesting, Mr. Justice,
that the fact that the court is in effect reviewing the
decision of the Patent Commissioner —
QUESTION:

No, but in this case whether or not the

patent is valid doesn't determine your case, in terms of
whether there's an antitrust violation.

You don't nee3 to

hold the patent invalid to argue that there was a per se
violation of the antitrust laws.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

But we think this is an

appropriate ancillary phase of the case.
QUESTION:

So is the jurisdictional question, is it

a pendent /I jurisdictional question — is the issue ju3t —
does the court have independent jurisdiction to consider this
question, or is it pendent
MR. FRIEDMAN:

to the antitrust issue?

I think it's pendent to the antitrust.

I think under Section 4of the Sherman Act, the jurisdiction.

26
The jurisdiction of the district court embraces anythir.g
that is ancillary and *—
QUESTION: But absent a subsequent antitrust claim,
would you say there is jurisdiction?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Perhaps under other sections, but

not under — I wouldn’t think, under Section 4 of the Sherman
Act.

Under the other provisions dealing with the —
QUESTION: Well, logically your position would be

that there was under the Sherman Act?

Logically, you would say

that there was an antitrust — if there's an invalid patent
being practiced?
MR. FRIEDMAN: We don't say that the mere practice
of an invalid patent itself is a violation of the Shernan Act.
What we do say is that there would have to be more than that
to be a violation of the Sherman Act, and I assume your
hypothetical was that all we had was just a naked suit
challenging a patent.

We wouldn't say that there's

jurisdiction to deal with that under the Sherman Act.
QUESTION: And it's just — just on the tip of your
tongue, there's some other section, is there, that you just
happened to think of?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I suggest two sections, Mr.
Justice.
QUESTION: An act regulating commerce, or what?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, one is 1338(a), original

27
jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of
Congress relating to patents; and also the section
QUESTION: All right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

— where the United States is the

plaintiff in the suit.
QUESTION: And you say, Mr. Friedman, that substantive 3.y
the question is not one of whether a patent may be collaterally
attacked, since they are in other proceedings, but whether —
it's one of standing, whether the government has standing to
collateral issues.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, the government has standing
to challenge a patent involved in an antitrust violation,
where there's no claim of fraud on the Patent Office, and
where the patent is not relied on as a defense.

That's the

case that we put to the Court.
Now, of course, the other —
QUESTION: Didn't Gypsum implicitly decide that
question against you?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

We think not, Mr. Justice —

In Gypsum the Court said that where the

patent is relied on, the government can attack the patent's
validity. And it went on to say, in this case, at least, there
was an antitrust violation, Gypsum, regardless of the patent's
validity, and therefore we don't need to decide the patent's
validity in this case.

28

MR. FRIEDMANs But then they went on to say —
QUESTION:

In other words, saying where reliance on

the patent does not give immunity from the antitrust action,
we don't need to decide it.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
decide it.

But then the Court went on and did

The Court went on and —
QUESTION:

The validity of the patents?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, no.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

No.

No.
QUESTION: Well, that’s what we’re talking about here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But, of course, in the Gypsum case

we were challenging the validity of the patent only because
the defendants were relying on it.

Whereas, in this case,

they're not relying on it and we are challenging the patent
as incidental to the antitrust violation.
Now, if I may come to two other respects in which
the Bell case is quite different.

First of all, the statement

in the Bell case of course was not necessary to the decision
in the case, because the actual holding in the case was that
the government had not proved fraud.
Secondly, and more importantly, the Bell case was
decided only seven years after the Sherman Act was passed.
There's no reference in the opinion in the Bell case to the
Sherman Act, and again the Bell case did not involve any
challenge to a patent in connection with an antitrust suit.

29

It was a naked challenge to the patent, and the Court said
that a naked challenge to the patent by the government, where
the government challenges it for fraud and fact, that it cannot
challenge it just on the ground of a mistake on the part of the
Patent Office.
And we think that in the light of the more recent
decisions of this Court dealing, giving broader rights to
challenge patents, and the right of its repeated statements of
the importance of permitting authoritative testing of patents,
if Bell is read as precluding the government's challenge to
the patent in this situation, we then suggest that Bell should
be reexamined and rejected to that extent.
I'd now like to turn to the other phase of this
case, which is the relief aspects, and what we think is the
court's error in failing to grant us these two additional items
of relief.

That is, to require the appellees to sell in bulk,

and to give reasonable patent license royalties.
This Court has many times specified the purposes of
antitrust relief to cure the ill effects of the illegal conduct
and protect the public from its continuation.

It is said that

the relief must be effective to restore competition, and in
a much broader statement from the International Salt case,
that it should pry open to competition

a market that has

been closed by the defendant's illegal restraints.
Now, of course, the district courts have broad

30

discretion in framing relief in antitrust cases, but this
Court again has pointed out that it has never hesitated to
step in in what is described as perhaps the most critical
aspect of the antitrust case, to take whatever steps are
necessary to insure that the relief is adequate.
Now, while the bulk sales prohibition was in effect,
there were no sales of this product in bulk in the United
States,

The three licensees had all of the market, and, as

would be expected in this kind of a situation, the prices
were virtually identical.

We have figures in the record

showing the prices charged by the three licensees at wholesale
to the druggists.
On the regular size of the capsule, the prices were
identical of all three of the licensees,
of 100 capsules of the most popular size.

$10.40 for a bottle
In the microsize

type of drug, which, as I indicated, is the most popular at
the moment, there were microsized variations in the prices.
One of them charged $12.14, the other $12.10, and the third
one $12.04.
Once again, substantially identical prices.
The three licensees are the major — three of the
major drug firms in this country, they sell drugs under
well-known trademark names. They advertise extensively.
They engage, as we all know, in very extensive promotions.
There are several small firms in the drug business,

31
who are so-called generic drug manufacturers.

They sell the

same product under the generic name or under their own name,
which is not well advertised.
These firms compete on price, they do not have the
big name brand but they are able to sell the drug cheaper,
and many people are willing to accept the non-name brand for
a lesser price.
And the evidence in this case is that for the generic
distributor to be able to compete effectively with a brand
name on a product like this griseofulvin, they have to sell
at about two-thirds the price that the brand name charges.
There's also indication that several of these drug
manufacturers are very interested in going into the griseo­
fulvin business.
After the appellees had cancelled, shortly after the
time the suit was brought, the restriction on bulk sales,
American Home Products offered both bulk griseofulvin and
the capsule form in this country.

But the testimony is that

they offered it at prices to these generic manufacturers at
which the latter could not effective compete in the market.
For example, ICI charged its licensee, American Home,
$78 a kilogram for bulk griseofulvin.

ICI, in turn, offered

the same bulk product to these generic firms at prices
ranging from $118 to $141 a kilogram.

And it's hardly

surprising that the other firms besides the licensees were

32
not interested in purchasing and could not do so econonicaily.
Now, American Home Products also offered capsules,
and once again statements by two of the generic manufacturers
stated that they couldn’t compete effectively with American
Home Products at the prices American Home was quoting ro
them, which presumably was the pxice at which American Homs
would make a profit.
Two of them did buy sosne capsules.

One small firm

bought a million capsules for distribution, an order that
came to about $46,000, and after they had finished
distributing, with all their marketing and distribution
costs, they discovered that they were losing $2,30 on every
bottle they sold.

And when American Home Products refused to

reduce the price, of course they stopped any broad-scale
promotion of griseofulvin.
The $2.30 figure is contained in the statement at
page 228 of the record.
Now, this evidence as to what happened after the
parties terminated their bulk sales restrictions demonstrates
to us that an order of the district court merely prohibiting
the restraint on bulk sales isnfct going to have any effect at
all in restoring competition in this market.

All that order

tvould do would be to continue by judicial decree what the
parties have been doing up till that time.

There's no reason

to think that if all we have in this case is an order

33

directing the appellees to stop prohibiting bulk sales that
there's going to be any change in this market.

Why should

the appellees now decide to permit the various competitors to
come into the market?

There’s no reason why, because this

market has continued for ten or twelve years in a concentrated,
non-competitive situation, and there’s no reason on earth why,
unless they're required to do something more than what has
been done, that there's going to be any competition.
The appellees have been selling, one of them, Glaxo,
at $60 a kilogram; ICI at $78 a kilogram for many years.
There's no reason to think that they're not profiting on this
business, and we see no reason why they shouldn't also be
ordered to sell, to offer this product to the other people
in the United

States who want to enter the market.

Now,

we want to make it very clear in our proposed judgment,
all that we're saying is that if they continue to sell in this
country, if they continue to sell in this country at all,
they have to offer the product to all on non-discriminatory —
at a non-discriminatory level.
And we think this is what is required in order to
inject some competition into this market.

And when 1 say

inject some competition, frequently the relief is framed in
terms of "to restore competition", to restore the status quo.
In this case there's nothing to restore, because there's never
been any competition in this market.

This market started

34

in a non-competitive, concentrated basis, and that's the way
it's continued.
We are also urging that there should be some
compulsory licensing of patents at reasonable royalties.
We covered that fully in our brief, and I would therefore
like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sailer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY P. SAILER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE GLAXO GROUP LIMITED
MR. SAILER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As Mr. Friedman has indicated, there are two
appellees in this case, and I represent the appellee Glaxo
Group Limited, and am speaking on behalf of Glaxo, although
many of my points will apply to both the appellees.
I have found the government's position on what I
call the basic issue in this case, the non-relief issue, to
be quite elusive from the beginning, but I think I'm now
— I now understand what they are saying in this Court, and I
would now like to state it as I understand it, and then
direct my remarks to that, if I may.
I think their position is this:

that when the

Attorney General brings an ordinary antitrust case, to challenge
ordinary antitrust restrictions, and somewhere in the picture
there are patents — and I will get back to this ■— he should

35

have a right first to try the antitrust suit and then after
that suit is determined and he's gotten an antitrust judgment,
and gotten antitrust relief, go on and try a patent suit, a
suit on the question of patent validity with no antitrust
issues, with nothing but ordinary patent law issues? what I
call issues arising under the patent code, inventions and the
like.
Now, I understand that the government seeks that
position even where, as in this case, the outcome of the
antitrust suit doesn't depend in any way on the validity or
invalidity of the patent.

I think that's conceded here.

And even where, as here, the government has won the antitrust
suit and has gotten antitrust relief.
Now, the appellees think that there is no more or
less reason for allowing a pure, what I call a pure, ordinary
patent suit in this situation than there would be for allowing
the Attorney General to bring an ordinary patent validity suit
all by itself, whenever he saw fit to do so.
I don't understand appellant to press that right
in this case, and I'll come to some observations about that
question.

But I think that I'm unable to distinguish between

the two situations.
Now, appellant has made some broad, factual, as
well as legal arguments in this case, but the adjudicated
facts are very narrow indeed, and I'd like to emphasize

36

them for the Court's consideration.
This case involves restrictions on the resale, the
resale, of griseofulvin. The appellees also had agreements
that related to the sale by patent licensees of any
griseofulvin that they might manufacture, but those agreements
have not been challenged by the government in this case.
They would have challenged them, they chose not to challenge
them.
The government didn't charge any over-all conspiracy,
it has three judgments on the merits and each one is directed
to a written provision of a written contract.

In each case,

a provision that says you may not resell griseofulvin in
bulk.
Now, there's no question but that those provisions
can't be justified by patents, no attempt was made to justify
them by patents.

They're ordinary restraints on the resale

of a purchased commodity.
The record shows that when Glaxo made these
agreements it didn't have any doubt or question about its
legality,

Glaxo, the record shows, is an English company,

still has no place of business in the United States.
The provisions I'm talking about have long since been
cancelled.

The ICI provision, with its vendee, was cancelled

more than five years ago.

And the Glaxo provisions were

cancelled more than four and a half years ago.

And the

37

appellant has a judgment that expressly prohibits their
revival, and that judgment is already currently effective.
Now, in the trial court, appellant made that
challenge, and they also sought to challenge two patents on
the pure question of ordinary patent validity.
The original complaint challenged an ICI patent
relating to dosage form griseofulvin that had issued in
1959,

Later, after some time, appellant sought to amend

their complaint, to challenge the Glaxo patent on griseofulvin
in a particular form, so-called roicrosize or ultra-fine form.
That patent hadn’t even been issued until the fall
of 1967, which was shortly before this suit was brought and
very shortly before the restrictions, the only restrictions
we’re talking about, were terminated and cancelled.

It

hadn't existed at all at the time these agreements were
entered into, or for years afterwards; not for years.
Now, I do think it's Important to emphasize, although
I think the Court now has been made aware that the patents
weren't challenged on the ground they were invalid,because
they had been misused, or because they had been used to
accomplish illegal restraints or anything like that.

They

were challenged on the ground the Patent Office had made a
mistake under the patent law in issuing them.

That was the

sole ground of the challenge.
And below, I understand appellant not to have

38

relied on the antitrust laws, and I invite the Court to
examine the appellant's main brief on this subject below,
which beings in the record at page 263.

They there relied

on a claimed inherent power of the Attorney General to bring
suit to cancel invalid patents.
The trial court stated the issue, as it understood
it, as, and I quote, "whether the United States can challenge
a patent independent of any antitrust claims."

That's the

way the trial court formulated the issue that it decided,
and the trial court held that it couldn’t.
The appellant didn't petition for reconsideration,
and it didn't suggest to the trial court that it misunderstood
the issue it had ruled on before making the issue.
Now, the appellant hasn't appealed the question of
the inherent power of the Attorney General to challenge
patents.

I don't think it could appeal that question to this

Court under the Expediting Act.

That's not a question, in

my judgment, that arises under the antitrust laws.
Here they formulated a new issue, and I submit a
different issue, which is — they state it variously, but
I'll — whether they are patents that are involved in or
essential to or the foundation of or the keystone of — these
are

all terms that they used — can be challenged under the

antitrust jurisdiction in a pure, on pure patent law grounds,
in an antitrust case even when that challenge is not necessary

39

to enable the government to reach the antitrust violation,
the only antitrust violations alleged.
Now, in their reply brief in this Court, the govern­
ment claims that they did present this question that they now
seek to present, what I call the "patents involved in" question,
to the trial court.
Well, as I read the record, this simply isn't
correct.

The only materials they cite in support of this

proposition are at footnote 1 of their reply brief, and I
submit that those questions don't raise the issue meaningfully
as to ICI, and don't even raise it at all as to my client,
Glaxo,
None of the government's papers below as to Glaxo
ever mentioned any alleged involvement of Glaxo*s patent with
any antitrust violation.

What the government says here, the

question is one of law and therefore the court go ahead and
decide the question, assuming that the patent was indeed
involved in an antitrust violation,
I suggest. Your Honors, that whether Glaxo's patent
was involved in the restrictions on resale we're talking about
in any sense that's relevant here is not a question of law but
a question of fact.
Appellant didn't show below and it didn't ask the
court below to find, and the court below didn't find, that
Glaxo's patent was an essential element in the original

40

agreements.

Indeed, it couldn't possibly have found out,

the patent didn't even issue until seven or eight years after
the agreements we1 re talking about were made.
They didn’t ask the court to find, the court didn't
find, that the violations would have been any more effective,
any different, if the Glaxo microsize patent, which issued
seven years, eight years after the agreements were made, had
never existed.
I suggest that there's an interesting contrast
between the situation here and that that existed in the Ansul
case, in 448 F. 2d, as cited in the appellant's reply brief,
where the trial court was asked to make and did make very
specific and detailed findings on the actual involvement of
the patent that was in issue in an independent antitrust
violation,
QUESTION:

Mr. Sailer, —

MR. SAILER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— both you and Mr. Friedman have used

the term "involved in".

What do you conceive that to mean in

the context you're using it?
MR, SAILER:

Well, I invite you to ask Mr. Friedman

that guestion, Your Honor; that I don't quite know what he
does mean.

But I suppose that my answer is that whatever

it means, if it means anything relevant at all, it seems to
me it must mean a sine qua non or a foundation or basis of

41
the agreement that was alleged to violate the law.
Otherwise, it — it is there, there is such a
patent, I concede that.

But if it doesn’t mean that, I

don’t know what possible relevance "involved", in any other
sense, would have.
I dealt with this point at pages 15 and 16 of my
brief, and I invite the Court’s attention to it.

I just

don't think the factual predicate for the agreement — for
the issue they seek to raise, at least as to my client, is
here.
But I don't need to rest on that narrow, although
dispositive, ground as to my client.
Even if the Glaxo patent had been truly related to
or involved in, in any sense, in the antitrust violation, I
suggest that will be no reason to give the government a right
to engraft on this ordinary antitrust case a straight patent
validity suit, involving no antitrust issues, nothing but
patent issues, unless, as in the Gypsum case, it was necessary
to do so in order to reach a cure in antitrust violation;
that's not claimed here.
The government doesn't claim that unless it's
permitted to try to invalidate the patents it can't reach
the antitrust violation or obtain antitrust relief.

Indeed,

the only antitrust violation has been abandoned five years
ago, its revival has been enjoined.

42
Now, appellant concedes in its reply brief, and
Mr. Friedman again conceded on ox-al argument, that they
could not have invoked the Sherman Act jurisdictioai, they
say, solely to raise the patent validity issue.

But at. the

same time they want to first try an antitrust case and,
having tried it, now try an altogether separate and
distinct patent validity case; and the logic of that simply
escapes me.
,

i

It seems to me that they suggested no reason why
the parties should now go through a pure patent litigation
that wouldn't have equally existed if there had been any
antitrust suit in the first place. The government does argue
that invalid patents are burdens on commerce, like sunken
logs in streams, and so forth; but that kind of argument
simply proves too much here.

That is an argument that would

be equally out of
QUESTION: Well, you might well argue that if an
antitrust violation is achieved through the mechanisms of the
patent, that it gave the patentee such leverage that he could
achieve certain restraints of trade that he might not
otherwise achieve, that they could argue, just as a matter of
remedy, they ought to —
MR. SAILER:

Yes.

I want to make it perfectly

clear, Mr. Justice White, that the government misstates
our position in their — I think misunderstands our position

43
in their reply brief.

We don't take the slightest issue with

the proposition in an appropriate case, the court in an
antitrust case plainly has power to —
QUESTIONS

If you find in a license agreement a

condition that you won't sell, a territorial restriction, or
a customer restriction, and it's in a patent agreement, you
wouldn't think — it isn't so unreasonable to think that the
licensee is agreeing to that limitation of his market only
because he's on the hook, he wants that patent, the use of
that patent.
MR. SAILER:

Look, I can readily agree with you,

arguendo, on that, Mr, Justice, and say at the same time that
under those circumstances it might well be appropriate for a
court to decree compulsory patent licensing, for example.
But here we're talking about something —
.

QUESTION: But even there it wouldn't be wholly

irrational to say that as a matter of remedy they ought to
get rid of the power that was the fulcrum for this violation,
MR. SAILER:
QUESTION:
MR. SAILER:

Well, I have a hard time seeing —
I agree with you that —
— that an antitrust issue as a

question — I mean a patent suit as a remedy, if you will.
QUESTION:

I agree with you that it would be a

very arguable remedy, but, nevertheless, it's one step beyond
the compulsory licensing.

44
MR. SAILER:

Well, I would say it’s one very, very

long step,
QUESTION:
MR. SAILER:

Yes.
The government denigrates our position

somewhat as relying on some old case that was decided a long
time ago, that if I understand Mr. Friedman's argument.
Now, we don't simply say, Here's this case, don't
pay any attention to whether it's right or not, there it is
on the books, and therefore we want you to follow it.
The Bell case was decided in 1897, 75 years ago, and from that
day to this, the government has never claimed the power, until
this case, that they're now asserting, the power to attack
patents even when there is not necessary in order to serve
antitrust ends, or to reach antitrust violations.
If that rule were changed, it would open up a whole
new and different class of patent litigation.

It would mean

that the government could — there are provisions in the
patent code for judicial review at the instance of a dis­
appointed would-be patentee.

He may take the Patent Office

to court.
Congress has not seen fit to turn that around and
say that if somebody gets a patent that the government doesn't
think should have been issued, that they can go to court.
There is no such provision in the statute.
I suggest that what the Attorney General is really

45

asking for is an implied general appellate and revisory
jurisdiction over the Patent Office.
Now, I want to talk about Gypsum for a minute,
because there is a dispute between the parties as to whom
Gypsum helps.

And I enthusiastically agree with the

implication of Mr* Justice Stewart's question, that Gypsum
QUESTION:

—

I got the idea from your brief.

MR. SAILER:

It's nice of you to say so, Mr. Justice.

— that very strongly cuts in our direction.

In

the Gypsum case, the government had sued and said, Here's some
illegal restraints, and the defendant said, Those restraints
would be illegal if we didn't have patents, but we do have
patents.
The government wanted to amend their complaint, to
challenge the patents, because, without doing so, they couldn't
reach the underlying antitrust violation.
And under that narrow set of facts, this Court said:
if it were necessary to challenge the patent in order to reach
the antitrust violation, the government should be allowed to
do it.
But I invite the Court's attention to what actually
happened in that case.

The Court found that the restraints

were illegal whether or not the patents were valid or invalid,
a nd made it perfectly clear that, in its view, that was the
end of the matter.

You didn't go on, even so, and have an

46
ordinary patent validity suit, which is what Mr. Friedman
is suggesting here.
I want to —
QUESTION:
MR. SAILER:
QUESTION:
MR. SAILER:

And so the patent was untouched?
In the Gypsum case —
Yes.
-- they never had any litigation about

the validity of the patents.
Now, I want to say one word and only a word about
this anomaly argument of the government.

They say it is

anomalous to allow private parties to challenge patents and
not allow the government to do so.

That's not our position

at all.
There are situations where both private parties
and the government can challenge patents.

And if the

government is infringing a patent, and the patentee sues
in the Court of Claims, which is his remedy, the government,
like anybody else, can defend on the ground that the patent
is invalid.

The government could seek a declaratory judgment

action that a patent was invalid if it wanted to use the
patent.
So we're certainly not positing a situation where
the government doesn't have the same rights as a private
party, we're saying it has those rights and no other rights,
unless Congress gives it to them.

47
The other situation mentioned was the misuse
situation,

X point out a very major difference between the

misuse situation and what x-ze're talking about here.

When

you adjudicate patent misuse you don't go and have a trial
about whether the patent is valid or not, whether the patent
should have been issued, whether there's invention, whether
there is prior art, that sort of thing; it is misuse that
bars you from asserting certain remedies for, under the patent,
f or a certain period of time.
But it has nothing to do with the validity or
invalidity of the patent.
QUESTION: Well, does a misuse trial in effect
concede the validity of the patent?
MR, SAILER:

Well, in a misuse — I guess the

answer to that question — where it concedes it arguendo, I
suppose, Mr, Justice; it assumes it, I would suppose, because
the question is implicitly assuming the patent is valid,
how much will we limit, nevertheless, and for what period
the enforcement of that patent by the patentee.
Now, I want to say one word on the second question
in this case, this question of relief.
As I pointed out below, that the only restraint
challenged, the only restraint found in this case was one
on the power of vendees to resell.

Now, those restraints

had been terminated and their revival has been enjoined.

48

Now, Mr. Friedman talks about creating and
restoring and so forth competition, that it seems to us that
what the Court, in fashioning a remedy in this case, had
his eye on was to create, as far as he could, a market structure
of a kind that would likely have existed had these restraints
on alienation never existed.
Now, the government has made a very revealing
statement, I think, in the course of their argument.

They

say the termination of these restraints is not likely to
create competition, because the individual economic interest
of each of the vendees will cause those vendees not to sell
bulk griseofulvin to their competitors so that their
competitors can compete with them.

I agree with that, and

I suggest, for that reason, although none of us can know
certainly that the government's own argument indicates
strongly that there isn't any rational reason to believe that
if these restraints which the record shows, at least as ICI,
would routinely put into all its patent licenses, and
distribution limits, that if these restraints had never
existed, I suggest there is no evidence that Schering,
Johnson & Johnson, and American Home Products, which were the
three appellees and the only people bound by these restrictions,
would have been enthusiastically selling bulk griseofulvin
to their generic competitors so the generic competitors
could in turn go in and undercut them in the marketplace.

49
Arid on this point I want to point to one item of
evidence that is mentioned at page 29 of my brief, and that
is that there is evidence about the bulk sales practices of
all three of these licensees in this case, that there was
testimony from Johnson & Johnson that it was not and never
had been in the business of selling bulk drugs at all.
There was testimony from Schering that at no time during the
relevant period had it ever resold a purchased drug in bulk,
never, as to any purchased drug.

And I suggest that that is

a rather strong indication that there be no reason to believe
that they would have been out selling griseofulvin in
bulk, absent this restriction.
And American Home Products, the third licensee, in
the year *69, sold $8,000 worth of bulk drugs out of a total
in corporate sales of $900 million.

And I suggest that that

indicates pretty clearly that none of these licensees would
have been out selling bulk griseofulvin even if these
restraints had never existed.
I do not want to exceed my half of the time, and
therefore I would like to leave the question of relief,
beyond what I have said, to my brief.
Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIGMUND TIMBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE IMPERIAL
MR. TIMBERG:

CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please:
I should like to open by describing the antitrust
violation in this case as found by the Court below.

Because

I think it's crucial to both of the issues raised on this
appeal.
My client, Imperial Chemical Industries, is a
British company that was developed drugs in its U.K. labora­
tories, that it considered suitable for the U. S. market.
These drugs were too few to justify it in developing its own
organisation in the United States.
So in 1958 it entered into an elaborate, exclusive
distributorship agreement with a U. S, concern, AMHO, or
American Home Products, under which ICI exported the drugs
f.o.b. a U.K. port and AMHO took title to the drug which it
processed and sold in dosage form on the U. S. market.
•»

*

That agreement has never been challenged in this litigation.
ICI's antitrust violation did consist of a single
clause in a later, 1962, agreement dealing only with the
antibiotic griseofulvin, which provided that AMHO, its
distributor, not resell the griseofulvin in bulk without
ICI’s permission.

This clause was a routine carryover from

ICI’s many international drug agreements, perhaps involving

51
a hundred countries.

Its purpose was found by the Court to be

to insure proper worldwide medical standards for the drug's
use and preparation.
However, the district court found its effect to be to
reserve in ICI the power to control the conditions under which
the bulk drug might be resold.
Applying this Court's then recent decision in the
Schwinn case, the district court held the clause to be an
illegal restraint on alienation, violating Section 1 of the
Sherman Act,
The government did not charge, and the court did not
hold, that there was any monopolization under Section 2 of the
Act.
*

The record shows that this inadvertent restraint on
alienation was cancelled by ICI more than five years ago.
Only four months after the Schwinn decision, which the district
court characterized as unpredictable — that's not my
characterization — and four months before the complaint in
this case was filed.
Moreover, the restraint had no effect on competition
in the marketplace, for ICI's reserve power was never exercised.
No request was ever made to ICI or to AMHO for bulk griseofulvin
for use on the U. S. commercial market.
Pages 14 and 15 of our brief set forth the situation.
In depositions taken by the government, the officers

52

of one large and one small drug firm testified that they
considered the U. S. griseofulvin market too small, too
competitive, and unattractive for entry.
That market, by the way, had shrunk by one-sixth
during the two-year period, 1967 to 1969, from about $8 million
of retail sales annually to $6.7 million.
By their own affidavits, none of the independents,
who the government claims were denied access to bulk
griseofulvin, showed any interest in the drug until one year
after the restriction was cancelled.
Considering their limited operations a-d resources,
these independents in fact could not have engaged in the
expensive and extensive clinical and toxicological testing
that was necessary to obtain Food and Drug Administration
approval for the drug, which we describe on page 13 of our
brief.
Nor could they have sustained the heavy laboratory,
operating, and promotional expenses involved in launching
the product on a national market with appropriate medical
safeguards•
The record therefore, I submit to Your Honors,
abundantly supports the district court’s central finding on
relief, which was that the evidence did not show that a
current monopoly condition exists as a result of the bulk
resale restriction.

Absent such an effect or result, and

53
such a condition, there is, as we show in our brief, no legal
basis for the compulsory sale, and compulsory patent
licensing relief requested by the government.
Before leaving the rest of the subject of relief to
our brief, because I do want to address myself to the second
issue on this appeal, I should like to point out just one
fact.

A compulsory sale requirement in this case would

involve ICI in a breach of its binding contractual relationship
to its distributor, AMHO, a party not before this Court.
This is unfair, we think, to AMHO, whose large-scale
expenditures and efforts, both in obtaining the Food and Drug
Administration approval for the drug and launching it on the
U. S. market, has built up such U. S, market as there is for
ICI1s two hundred to three hundred thousand dollars' worth of
annual griseofulvin exports from the U.K.
If I may, I should like to address myself to the
patent invalidity issue, and in this connection I wish to make
two preliminary points*
First, the ICI patent is not a worthless and specious
patent, it embodies, as we point out in our brief, at pages
12 and 13, a true invention.

The efficacy of the drug was

conceded by the government, and its novelty is attested to by
the medical literature to which we refer in our brief.
It is not being attacked for lack of patentability,
or for lack of novelty, or utility.

It is being attacked

54
fro two alleged errors of judgment by the Patent Office in
the allowance of patent claims, as Mr, friedman has described
here.
The question is, is the possibility of correcting
such errors sufficient justification for prolonging into an
indefinite future an antitrust litigation, the antitrust
aspects of which have been concluded after five painful
years?
Second, the District Court held that neither ICX
nor the Glaxo patent had been abused.

Yet the Attorney

General is asking for broader relief, the complete invalida­
tion of the patent, than a private defendant in a patent
infringement suit could obtain, where patent misuse had been
abundantly demonstrated.
On pages 4 to 5 of the government's reply brief,
they do refer to the Morton Salt and Ansul cases, which do
establish a doctrine of patent misuse.
But I must, I should remind the Court that this
Court has held that the defendant there is only entitled to
a stay of the infringement suit until the improper practice
has been abandoned — whatever that might be in our case —
and the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been
dissipated.
Now, Your Honors, you learned for the first time
from the government's reply brief, and from Mr. Friedman's

55

colloquy, .1 believe it was with Mr. Justice White, that the
government’s position is that, in an antitrust controversy,
pendent jurisdiction of a patent invalidity claim may be
asserted.
This is my apology for bringing up a case which I
have communicated to Mr. Friedman, it’s the case of UnitedMine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715.

This case teaches us

that for pendent jurisdiction to apply, the main antitrust
claim and the pendent patent invalidity claim must derive
from a common nucleus of operative facts.
It is clear that the factual issues

relevant to

the alleged errors of the Patent Office, in its allowance
of the ICI patent claim, which are set forth on page 25 of
our brief, and to which I refer the Court to pages 437 to 450
of the Appendix, have nothing in common with the factual
issues involved in the antitrust action.
Mr. Sailer has pointed out that the patent
invalidity has no bearing, either on the issue of antitrust
liability or on the issue of antitrust relief.

On pages 30 to

31 of our brief, we indicate that compulsory patent licensing
relief is available in antitrust cases, whenever the patent
poses an illegal barrier to competition.
In fact, as far as this case is concerned, my
client, by way of implementing its hands-off policy as far
as the U.S. market is concerned, has made its patent

56

generally available for licensing,, and has granted
licenses to five independents on reasonable terms, two of
which have already purchased griseofulvin from AMHO, its
distributor, and AMHO, I should also point out, as the
record shows, has offered to make bulk griseofulvin available
on reasonable terms in at least fifteen different cases.
This was in a short period of time before the record
in the case closed.
Furthermore, as stated in Gibbs, pendent jurisdic­
tion is a doctrine of judicial discretion, justified by
considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness
to the litigants.
The challenge of patent validity supported by the
Attorney General
considerations.

flies in the face, we think, of these
As this Court pointed out in Blonder-Tongue,

it would needlessly promote, protract an expensive
litigation.

It would expand the already crowded dockets

of the district courts.

t

Under the Expediting Act, this Court would have to
review such extraneous patent law determinations directly
from the district court without the helpful assistance of the
Circuit Courts of Appeal.
Also, speaking from the patentee's standpoint.
such challenges are unfair to the patentee.

He is entitled

to assume, until Congress has spoken to the contrary, that

57
the action of the Patent Office in granting the patent is
not to be independently challenged by one or two lawyers in
the Justice Department, however gifted their powers of analysis
may be.
Finally, from the aspect of Sherman Act and
antitrust enforcement, these challenges would be academic
and purposeless exercises that would operate wastefully,
to divert time, money, and resources from the

more purposeful

prosecutions.
A word about the legal issues in the case.

We do,

of course, think that public policy considerations do favor
the affirmance of the district court's ruling? but the
determinative issue is a legal one that goes to the heart of
our constitutional system of separation of powers.
Has Congress in fact authorized the courts to
entertain this kind of challenge of patent validity?

As this

Court said in Simpson v. Onion Oil, "Congress ... is the
arbiter of the public interest."
Thus, even where the more effective enforcement of
the Sherman Act was at stake, this Court has been unwilling to
confer on private parties a remedy that had not been prescribed
by Congress.
That was the case of Kelly vs, Kosuga, cited in our
brief.
Similarly, it has been unwilling to confer on the

58

Attorney General a remedy that has not been prescribed by
Congress, and that is the Cooper case, referred to in our
brief.
As this Court said in the Cooper case, It is not
the function of the courts to engraft on a statute additions
which they think the legislature logically might or should
have made.
The rule of the Bell case has been stated, and we
say only that it is more than a sound rule of decision.
reflects, to us, a constitutional imperative.

It

For the

courts to try issues of patent validity without congressional
authorization involves the negation, we think, of two basic
powers conferred by the Constitution on the Congress.
One of these is the plenary power of Congress to
legislate on the subject of patents.

The other is the

exclusive congressional power to prescribe the jurisdiction
of the federal courts, including the jurisdiction to review
administrative decisions, such as those made by the Patent
Office in this case.
Now, in the exercise of its patent power, Congress
has paid particular and continuing attention to the
administrative procedures, for examining and reviewing patents
within the Patent Office and its predecessor agencies, and
the judicial procedures for reviewing these
determinations

administrative

59

We cite on page 36 of our brief twelve such cases
where the Congress has amended the patent code.

Despite

this meticulous and specific supervision by the Congress, the
patent code contains no provision conferring this authority
on the Attorney General to initiate in the courts the kind
of challenge of patent validity involved in this case.
We also refer, in footnote 42 of our brief, to
several proposals that have been made, giving the Attorney
General and other persons the right to challenge,collaterally
challenge patent validity.

None of these has ever been

reported out of congressional committee, and it is
significant that the impact of these proposals is that the
challenger must sue to cancel or revoke the patent in the
Patent Office first before seeking review in the courts.
And it is submitted that perhaps this may be the logical
method of procedure, rather than the procedure supported by
the government.
QUESTION:

Mr, Timberg, is the apparently established

authority of a court to declare a patent invalid in a suit
involving the licensee and the licensor; is that authorized by
statute or is that —
MR. TIMBERG:

It is, indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

That has been in the statute, I think, since 1870.

The right

of a person sued for a patent infringement to defend the case.
I think it*s in the statute, yes, he may specifically defend

60
on the grounds of invalidity.

I don't think that's been

contested.
In fact, I don't think the government has pointed,
for all of its analogies, to — it's 35, my colleague informs
me it’s 35 USC, Section 282 that confers that right.
QUESTION: And more recently in a suit for royalties?
MR. TIMBERG:

Yes, and that was along the same

line of reasoning that led to the Gypsum case.

In other words,

if the royalties are predicated upon an illegal agreement,
and it is —
QUESTION:

Let's just assume a patentee sues his

licensee for royalties, unpaid royalties, and the licensee
says, Well, I don't need to pay you, the patent's invalid.
MR. TIMBERG:

I assume, under Lear v. Adkins, if

that's the case Your Honor is referring to, he would be able
to challenge that portion,
QUESTION:

There you say jurisdiction is predicated

on some other —
MR. TIMBERG:

it's predicated on something else,

yes, Your Honor.
I'd like to — as a matter of fact, I'd like to —
QUESTION:

Mr. Timberg, —

MR. TIMBERG:
QUESTION:
Rehnquist's question.

Yes.

I thought that was the import of Justice
Now, is that last rule based in

61
statute or in judicial decision?
MR. TIMBERG:

It's based ultimately on statute.

If I may say a word, Mr. Justice Blackmun, on the question of
Gypsum.
In our view Gypsum confirms the Bell case, and
underscores the paramount authority of the Congress to
prescribe the jurisdiction of the courts and the authority of
the Attorney General;in enacting the Sherman Act Congress did
confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain anti­
trust suits that were brought by the Attorney General.
There was a possibility in Gypsum that the defendants would
rely on patents as a defense to a charge of illegal price­
fixing.
Hence, if the Attorney General were not given the
opportunity to show patent invalidity, and that the asserted
shield of patentability does not exist, the congressional
grant of jurisdiction to enforce the Sherman Act would be
frustrated.

And this, I think, is the theme that I would

suggest reconciles Gypsum with the questions that both of Your
Honors have been asking.
We say that if the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act
would be frustrated, and such a similar situation was involved
in the Walker Processing Equipment case; yes, in those cases
the court may reach to a patent invalidity defense.
But what the government is doing in this case is

62

that, independently of raising it as a defense, they are
collaterally, in their complaint, attacking patent
invalidity in a situation that has nothing at all to do with
the policy of the antitrust lav/s.
QUESTION: Well, what if the government says, and
alleges there's been a tying — there's a tying agreement here
in existence, here it is right on the face of the paper, and
the engine of this tying arrangement is the patent, the
patent leverage, the economic power of the patent being
used to secure and enforce this tying arrangement.

And the

government says, We think the patent is invalid and should be
declared invalid, so as to eliminate this power,
MR. TIMBERG:

If in fact that were alleged to be

the leverage that made the restraint possible, then this
would — that might be so; but this is not that case, Your
Honor.

This is a situation where the leverage that might have

made the restraint possible was the fact that two persons
controlled the manufacture of this commodity, which is indeed
an expensive commodity ~
QUESTION: They also have patents,
MR. TIMBERG: They also have patents, may I say,
and they also cross-license the patents.

But the reason that

they cross-license the patents to each other was that they
were blocking patents.

They couldn't even get going in the

United Kingdom on the manufacture of the griseofulvin unless

63
they cross-licensed each other.
QUESTION: Was the pooling dissolved in this case?
MR. TIMBERGs The pool couldn't be dissolved.

It

was really a settlement of conflicting patent rights, because
none of the three distributors in the United States

could

even have gotten on the market unless they had access to
Id's dosage patent, which, as Mr. Sailer has pointed out,
was the only patent in the field until September 1967, when
the Glaxo patent came in.
But the situation in England was much more complicated
than that, and I would want Your Honors to bear in mind that
the 1960 agreements, which the government has referred to,
v/as an agreement that had worldwide implications.
an agreement between two British companies.

It was

It wasn't

specifically directed against the U. S. market, and the
particular provision in the 1960 agreement, the good-faith
provision that ICI impose this restriction on its distribu­
tor, was something that was found illegal only to the
extent that it affected the U. S. vendees of ICI, which was
just our exclusive distributor AMHO,
So that in — dnless this Court is going to say that
it's never possible for people to have blocking patents, to
cross-license each other under those patents, and that they
must automatically license the world, this, the government's
claim for licensing in this case is not, I think, one that

64
is warranted, though the patent was not used to — was not
used to stop anybody from selling griseofulvin in this
country.

The only antitrust violation was the restraint on

alienation, which was cancelled.
In our case the patent license was —
QUESTION: Suppose it hadn't been.
MR. TIMBERG:

Well, if it had not been cancelled,

then there might be a possibility of the government urging
that the dosage patent be made available on a royalty-free
basis — excuse me, on a reasonable royalty basis, to all
applicants.

Which is within the discretion of the district

court.
QUESTION: Thatrsa question of remedy, then.
MR. TIMBERG:

It is.

It's a question of remedy,

pure and simple. Your Honor.
QUESTION: All right.

And so would it be a question

of remedy if they said not only that, but we think the patent
should be invalidated.

You could say that's a bad remedy,

but in terms of — but it still is a remedy question.
MR. TIMBERG:

it is a remedy question, but I get

back to the reason why I cited Kelly v. Kosuga and the
Cooper cases,

it is, if you want to call it a remedy, you

may, but it is a type of remedy which we believe should be
authorized by the Congress, which has authorized all sorts of
remedies in this situation.

65
That is our feeling with respect to this,
I don't think — the only other ground that the
government asserted was in connection with jurisdiction,
was the inherent equity jurisdiction grounds, that was the
only ground we thought they argued in the district court,
and in our brief we’ve indicated the irrelevance of the five
cases cited by the ATtorney General as supporting this
inherent equity jurisdiction; none of them involve patents.
Only one of them, decided in 1888, involved the judicial
review of an administrative determination; and we agree with
the result in that case, because we do believe that the
district court does have the right to,inherently, to look
into patents obtained by fraud*
We therefore conclude that the district court acted
wisely and correctly, and urge that its judgment be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Timberg.

Mr. Friedman, you have about three minutes left,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
We think that this patent, the leverage of this
patent most assuredly was involved in these violations. We
think the patent, in a very real sense, was the whole key to
these violations, because without the power of the patents

66

these firms could not have been able to impose these bulk
sales restrictions.
And when Mr. Timberg talks about the pooling
arrangement, that this was just designed to correct a problem
in the United Kingdom, where they had to cross-license, the
fact is that in addition to the pooling of the patents, Glaxo
saw fit and felt it necessary in that agreement to prohibit
ICI from permitting its licensees to sell in bulk.
So, obviously, it was not just something that these
people added, this bulk thing, as an afterthought.

The patent

license was all tied in with the bulk situation.
I'd like to invite the Court•s attention to a
document at page 86 of the record, in which a man from ICI
was discussing with someone from Squibb, not one of the
licensees, their interest in griseofulvin, and what this man
said was:

I gave Mr. Dahl, that is of ICI, some idea of the

patent situation on griseofulvin in such form as will, I hope,
have impressed upon him the impossibility of Squibb trading
in griseofulvin without a license from Glaxo under the ICI
and Glaxo patents.
In other words, this whole market was tied up, the
whole market was kept free from any competition because of
these patents. And that's why we think these patents are
involved in the violation. The leverage of the patents, the
power of the patents was an important element affecting the

67
violation.
Now, Mr. Sailer has said that our argument that the
licensee’s self-interest will lead them to continue the
existing situation proves too much, because he says that
proves that even had there not been these restraints,
nevertheless, the licensees independently would have reached
the same result.
Well, the self-interest we're talking about now is
their self-interest in continuing the existing situation.
And with respect to the claim that the appellees
have sold so little of — I'm sorry, the licensees have, in
effect, been de minimis in selling other drugs in bulk, and
therefore it's a reasonable assumption they wouldn't have
sold these drugs in bulk, Mr. Sailer referred to statistics
showing that in 1969 ICI sold only, oh, eight to ten thousand
dollars' worth of drugs.
The documents contained at pages 239 to 244 of the
record, in earlier years, for example, in 1961, ICI sold
better than two hundred thousand dollars' worth of the drug.
And if you look through these particular things, in 1962, ICI
sold $223,000 of this drug.
One other fact, there is also in the record a table
at 243 to 244 which shows bulk sales by the Schering Corporation
of other drugs, and in a period of ten years this firm sold
approximately $11 million in bulk other than griseofulvin.

68

In the face of that, we think that it cannot be
said that if it had not been for these restrictions in the
bulk sales they nevertheless would have accomplished the
same objective. We don't know. We do know that there were these
restrictions. We do know that the market following these
restrictions was non-competitive, and we think appropriate
relief is to make it competitive for the first time.
Mr. Chief Justice, I misspoke myself at one point,
where I said ICI and I meant American Home Products.

Mr.

Sailer has probably corrected me.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:12 o'clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
