ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justicef may it please the

Courts
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
to review a five to four en banc decision of that court which
held that under the Sixth Amendment a defendant in a criminal
case is entitled to the presence of counsel at a pre-trial
showing of photographs to witnesses to the crime which he
is accused of committing.
This case arises out of an armed bank robbery of
the branch office of the American Security and Trust Company
in the District of Columbia on the 25th day of August, 1965»
A lone gunman entered the bank, put a stocking mask over a
portion of his face, announced his intentions and told
everyone not to move.
Immediately thereafter a second man entered the
bank, ran behind the tellers* cages, scooped up the money,
and ran out of the bank followed by the gunman who had

4
initially entered the bank.

As the bandits ran from the

bank, they again removed the stocking mask which covered
their faces up to the bottom of their noses and at this point
they were both seen with their faces uncovered by a woman who
was seated in a car outside of the bank.
The two robbers, however, made good their escape
and it was not until some five months after the robbery rad
occurred that a convicted felon, concededXy seeking
consideration from the authorities, told them that one
Charles Ash had asked him, the informant, to participate in
the bank robbery and had on the day

following the robbery

admitted his participation to the informant.
On the basis of this information police gathered
five photographs, one of the defendant Ash, one of Bailey,
who was the accomplice which the informant told the
authorities Ash had implicated as the second man in the
robbery, and three other photographs.

These were all black

and white and they 'were shown to four witnesses to the
robbery.

Two of them were bank tellers, and both of them

selected photographs of Ash as the gunman.

Neither was

positive in their identification.
The third witness who was shown these photographs
was a customer of the bank who had seen the gunman enter
the bank and put the mask on.
of Ash.

He also selected a photograph

His identification was likewise inconclusive.

5
The fourth witness was the woman who had seen the
two running from the bank.

She also picked out a photograph

of Ash as being one of the two whom she had seen running
from the bank.

Her identification 'teas likewise uncertain.

The case, for a number of reasons, was not
scheduled for trial until May 8, 1965, some two and a half
years after the showing of the initial photographs and some
three years, almost three years, after the date that the
crime was committed.
The assistant United States attorney in charge of
the case no doubt wondering whether any of the eyewitnesses
would, be able to make any kind of identification at this
stage of the proceeding, had five color photographs displayed
to each of the four witnesses.

The five photographs included

one each of Bailey, one of Ash, and three others.

The two

defendants—
Q

The three were unconnected?

MR. KORMAN:

Unconnected with the robbery.

The two photographs of the defendants who were to
go on trial the following day were what is known as, I believe,
called full-length FBI case photographs, indicating their
height and their build.

Three other photographs were not

full-length but were cut at some point above and below the
chest.
At this point the results of the photographic

s
display were again inconclusive.

Three o

picked out Ash's photograph and said that he looked like him
or words to that effect.

Their identification- was uncertain.

A fourth witness, the gentleman who was a customer
at the bank, could not pick out any photograph.

Again, as in

the first instance, none of the witnesses were able to pick
out the photograph of the co-defendant, Bailey.
The district court, after a hearing, pre-trial
hearing, held that the initial photographic display which
took place five months after the robbery, was not
impermissibly suggestive and that regardless of the propriety
of the second showing of photographs, there was an
independent basis for the uncertain at that point eyewitness
identifications.
At the trial, the Government introduced the
testimony of its informant, who under oath testified that
Ash had asked him to participate in the robbery and that the
day following the robbery Ash had admitted his participation
to him.
The Government also introduced the testimony of the
four eyewitnesses.
identifications.

Three of them again made inconclusive
They were not positive of their identifica­

tion of Ash, merely picking hira out as looking like or words
to that effect.
The fourth, the woman who was seated in the car

7
and who had of all the witnesses perhaps the -greatest
opportunity to view the bandits unmasked, picked out both
Ash and Bailey positively»
Again, none of the' other three witnesses were able
to select Bailey at all as even looking like the second
person that had been involved in the robbery.
The prosecution during its case did not elicit
the fact that there had been any pre-trial identifications
from photographs.

Bailey’s counsel, however, was anxious

to show that Mrs. Apple, who had made a positive identifica­
tion of Bailey in the courtroom, had been unable the day
before to pick Isis photograph out of the five that were shown
to her.

And so during the defense case, he called the FBI

agent and Mrs. Bailey to elicit the fact that, one, she had
indeed been shown photographs; she had picked out one person
as being one of the tV7o she had seen running from the bank
but was unable to pick out the photograph of Bailey.

And

he then offered the photograph of Bailey into evidence.
At this point the United States Attorney asked
that Ash!s photograph be offered into evidence, presumably
less the jury get the impression that the other person she
had picked out was someone other than Ash.
Ultimately all five photographs were admitted and
the jury thus became aware that Mrs. .Apple had made an
uncertain identification of Ash9 s photograph on the day

8

be fore tria1.
The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to
Bailey.

As to him, the only evidence was the positive

identification of the witness in court.

The jury was hung,

and after the trial the judge directed a verdict of
acquittal.

The defendant Ash, however, was convicted of all

counts of the indictment arising out of the armed bank
robbery.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach the
.issue of whether the second pre-trial photographic display
was improperly suggestive.

The majority stated that

certainly the elements of suggestiveness were strong enough
so that it cannot be assumed there was no undue suggestiveness
in the absence of explicit findings by the trial court.

^

Of course, the trial court had not reached this issue, but
the majority in the Court of Appeals likewise stated that it
was aware that there are indications offsetting in part the
inference of undue suggestiveness.
Since these other indications were not conclusive
and since there were no explicit findings by the district
court on this issue, the majority held that a remand would
ordinarily be required but for its conclusion that the
defendant was entitled to counsel at the photographic
display on the day before trial and that thus reversible error
was committed

in the admission of the fact that Mrs. Apple

9

had in fact made an identification, albeit an uncertain one,
on the day prior to trial.
We believe that this holding, which is contrary to
the holdings of nine other circuit courts of appeals and the
overwhelming majority of state courts is erroneous.
Accordingly# we ask that the judgment be reversed and that
the case be remanded for the further proceeding suggested, in
the opinion of the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals rested its decision, the
majority of five, principally on the holding of this Court
in United Statas against Wade, that a defendant was entitled
to counsel at forced confrontations between himself and the
witness or victim of the offense.

In holding that an

interview between prosecutor and the witness, at which the
accused was not present, was like a lineup, a critical stage
of the proceeding.

The court below, we submit, ignored the

critical and crucial distinctions between a lineup and a
photographic display.
The basis of this Court's holding, as we read Wade,
was that lineups were susceptible to many forms of subtle
suggestion, which increased the possibility of erroneous
identification.

And not only were they susceptible to this

kind of subtle suggestion, but because of the. nature of the
proceeding, it was impossible for a defendant to reconstruct
them at trial.

^

10
The reasons for the inability to reconstruct
these events was peculiar to the nature of the tense
emotional atmosphere that is involved when a victim or a
witness to a crime is confronted with the person who is
accused of perpetrating the crime.
The possibility of subtle suggestion is present
simply in the fact that it is a live lineup; the defendant
is asked to walk in, to move about, to don clothing, to utter
words.

The potential for suggestion, it has been suggested,

is present in everything from the clothing he wears to the
manner in which the lights are focused on him.
Under these circumstances, given the. inability to
reconstruct the subtle forms of suggestion, it was held that
a lawyer was present to enable the defendant at trial to
confront the witnesses against him and to elicit before the
jury or for the benefit of the court those elements which
were improper in the conduct of the lineup.
The difference between what Judge Wiikey in his
dissenting opinion called the little drama of a live
confrontation and the showing of five or six still photographs
to a witness or a victim is apparent.
just these five photographs.
He does not move around.

There is no defendant present.

He is not asked to say anything.

He is not asked to don any clothing.
upon him.

Initially there are

No lights are shone

11
In addition, the photographs are generally shown
in a touch.less emotionally charged atmosphere*

They are

shwon either in the office of the prosecutor or, as in this
ease, at the horns or place of business of the witnesses to
the crime.
While it is true there is still a potential for
suggestion, it is true that the photographs themselves
not be properly selective or in some other way indicate to
the witness who it is that the police think committed this
offense.

But that kind of suggestion is readily shown

simply by looking at the photographs at .a suppression
hearing*

And, indeed, in this case the defendant argued

and the Court of Appeals was able to give a minute descrip­
tion of the suggestive influences that it found present
simply on the basis of viewing the photographs.
This is not the same as simply taking a picture of
a lineup*

A picture of a lineup x^ould just show what happened

during that one split second when the picture was taken.
It would not. show what happened a minute after or a minute
before.

So that this is not, as the defendant, suggests in

his brief, the equivalent of taking a picture of a lineup.
It is also true that there is a potential for
suggestion in the words that may be spoken to the witness
when the photographs are shown.

But that kind of suggestion,

number one, can be revealed by the witness.

There is no

12

reason in the world why he should not ba able to testify
truthfully as to what was said to him when the photographs
were shown.

More significantly, there is no more potential

for suggestion there than in an interview wit lout any
photographs at all.

After all, if the prosecutor was so

inclined, ha could simply tell the witness, ''Well, remember
yoxi gave us a description.
was 19 years old.
well dressed.

You said the gunman in this case

He was black, light skinned.

He was wearing glasses.

He was

Well, you go into the

courtroom and take a look and see if you see him at the
defense table.”
That is the most apparent kind of suggestion which

•/

can take place without any kind of photographs being
present.

Yet it has never been held nor, as I understand,

has it ever, been suggested that any time a prosecutor even
talks with a witness to the crime that a lawyer is required
to be present.
And so for these substantial reasons we think that
this proceeding, showing of still photographs, is significantly
different and that this is not a critical stage of the
proceeding.
Also, there is another significant fact that
differentiates this case from the lineup case.

This is what

transpires when a prosecutor talks with a witness? this is
simply the preparation by the prosecutor of a witness for

13
trial.

We know of no case, one, that it. is ever held that

a defendant is entitled to a lawyer at a proceeding at which
he himself is not present.

Particularly this is so when the

proceeding is nothing more than an interview had between the
witness and the prosecutor as part of his preparation for the
trial of the case.

And 1 think that it is significant not

only the language of the majority opinion weighed which
constantly stressed the forced confrontation between the
accused and a witness to the offense, but also the concurring
opinions of the justices who cast the deciding votes on the
issue of whether a lineup was a critical stage of the
proceeding.
Mr. Justice Black, in concurring in that portion
of the opinion which this Court said that a lineup is a
critical stage of the proceeding, said, "I agree with the
Court that a lineup is a critical stage of the criminal
proceedings

against an accused because it is a stags at

which the Government makes use of his custody to obtain
crucial evidence against him.
Mr. Justice Clark, who cast the concurring vote
in that case, relied principally on Miranda v. Arizona as
the basis for his concurrence.

That case, of course,

involved custodial interrogation of an accused who was in
custody.

And so that that factor that the accused was

present when this transpired and needed a lawyer to help him

14
because of his very presence there we regard to be one of the
other crucial factors which distinguished this case from
Wade »
Q

Was there testimony in this case about the

pre-trial identification?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

At the trial?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Yes, there was.

Only during the defendant's case. yes.

Only during the defendant's case--

MR. KORMAN:

Right.

The prosecutor did not offer

any evidence during the course of the trial.
9

So, you think there is no Gilbert problem in

this case?
MR. KORMAN:

Mo, I do not follow you.

In what

way?
Q

Let us assume that Wade did apply the

photographic identifications and the prosecutor in examining
his witness brought out the fact of a pre-trial identification
absent counsel.

It would not help to show no taint then,

would it, under Gilbert?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

No, it would not.

As I understand-—

Is there any problem like that in this case

or not?
MR. KORMAN:

We do not dispute the finding of the

Court of Appeals that it was the Government who asked that

15
Ash’s photograph be introduced and that it was at the
Government * s behest that all—Q

Would you say then that if Wade ware held to

apply to this case that this case would automatically be
reversed?
MR. KORM&W:

That is correct, and that is precisely

V7hat the Court of Appeals did.
0

So that the finding of no taint—there was a

finding of no taint, was there not, here?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

By the district court.

Yes, but that would not override a Gilbert

violation?
MR. KORMAN:

No, it. would not.

Given both the state of the law, the overwhelming
majority of the cases which have decided this issue and have
held that a lawyer need not ba present at a photographic
display, the respondent has understandably relegated to
second place .in his brief the defense of the majority opinion
of the Court of Appeals.

And, instead, he would have this

Court decide this case on an issue which was not dealt with
by the district court, which the Court of Appeals felt was
not properly presented, given this state of the record.
That is, that in effect the showing on the day before trial
was so impermissibly suggestive as to constitute a violation
of due process.

hfj 1 have notc3f ths Court of Appeals, and I think

quits properly, was very careful in dealing with this issue
and in stating that they could not and would not, absent
specific findings by the district court on this particular
question, rule on this issue.
I think this careful disposition was correct for
two reasons.

Number one, the Constitution, of course,

provides that all criminal trials shall be by jury, in
Article Three, Section Two.

A finding that a particular

photographic identification was so impermissibly suggestive
as to constitute a violation of due process necessarily
ousts from the jury its function of considering the
reliability and credibility of this eyewitness identification,
even whereas here all of the facts can be brought before the
jury.
So that before a court reaches such a conclusion,
before a court determines to oust from the jury its crucial
fact-finding function under the Constitution, it should be
very careful to do so on a record that is complete cm findings
that are made fov a district court and should not reach out
and decide it on an inadequate record.
Second, it is worth noting that in this case are
the factors which the Court of Appeals alluded to, which
indicated the possibility that there was no such undue
suggestion that would lead to a due process violation.

One,

17
despite the alleged suggestion—and we have to keep in mind
that these photographs, to the extent that they were
suggestive, were suggestive as to Bailey as they were to
Ash, yet not a single witness was even able to pick out
Bailey's photograph and even say so much that he looked like
Bailey,
In the second place, despite the suggestion—
Q

Bailey was acquitted by the jury-—

MR. KORMAN:

Hung.

He was acquitted by the judge

after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
Q •

I sea.

MR. KORM&N:

In the second placa, even as to Ash,

three of the witnesses on the day before trial were able to
give only uncertain identifications and a fourth was not even
able to pick out his photograph.
And, in addition, because of the way the proceedings
were handled, the pre-trial hearing, none of the witness-—
all but one, I should say—-only one of the witnesses was even
asked questions about the effect which the viewing of the
photographs had on her the day before trial.
And the third reason I think ought to ba considered
before the Court deals with this is that this is really a
factual issue that has not been resolved by the two courts
below.

And at this stage we think it would be improper for

this Court to reach out to decide the issue before any

18

consideration was given to it by the lower courts.

And in

this respect I would call the court's attention to an
analogous case of United States against Foster, which this
Court concluded by a five to four vote that, in fact, the
identification was impermissibly suggestive, but declined to
rule on harmless error argument that had been advanced for
the first time in this Court, saying that it wished the
lower courts to resolve that issue first before it got
involved in what was essentially a factual determination.
And so for these reasons we would ask that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed, not that the
judgment of conviction be reinstated f but that the case be
remanded to the Court of Appeals for appropriate disposition
in accordance with the suggestion in its opinion.

Thank

you.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Koxman.

Mr. Cohn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHERMAN L. COHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COHNt

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
The Government, we submit, was quite correct in
Wade when it urged upon this Court that there is no meaningful
difference as concerns the right to counsel between a pre­
trial identification from photographs and a similar pre-trial

.19

identification made at a lineup.
Indeed, the trial judge in this case himself
testified, stated, in May of ’68 that there then had been a
recent increase in the use of photographic identification
in the District of Columbia.

This was nine months after the

decision in Wade.
I respectfully suggest that this case illustrates
precisely that the Government was correct in Wade, that
Wada was a correct decision and still is and that drawing
an artificial distinction between corporeal identification
procedures and photographic identification procedures would
not only be, in the Solicitor General’s words, meaningless,
but would permit the continued easy use of this device to
evade this Court’s clear holding in Wade.
One needs only to examine the facts in this case
to see how intentionally or unintentionally the United States
attorney attempted to use what I respectfully suggest is
impermissible suggestions.

I invite each and every member

of the Court to examine personally the colored photographs
of the 1968 identification procedure which arc in your file.
I respectfully urge that they portray graphically
what this case is all about.

The witnesses to the crime—who

had little opportunity to see the robbers, who made indefinite
or no identifications at a photographic array some five
months after the crime, who after the crime could describe

20

the robbers only as to height, about six foot; to build,
thin, slender; and color, black, light complexion—was
shown almost three years later and at that the day before
the trial, five photographs-.

Only two were full length.
markers to indicate six foot.
identification numbers.

Only two had height

Only two carried police

Only two were thin.

In each and

every case these two were the persons to be tried the next
day.

This the Government calls the preparation of a witness.
The Government urges that the fact that we know

these facts demonstrates that the presence of counsel at
the photographic ID could serve no purpose.

But here we part

ways with the Government and for two reasons.
First, as Gilbert v. California makes clear, the
requirement for counsel at critical stages of the proceedings
is not only to permit the raising and the proper presentation
of defenses but also as a prophylactic to deter constitution­
ally objecfcable practices.

Although I find it curious and

surprising to find a lone

United States attorney engaging

in such practices as I described nine months after Stovall
and two months after Simmons, I would find it most difficult
to conceive of a United States attorney engaging in such
tactics in the presence of the counsel for the defendant.

lie

21

would stand there as a reminder» a graphic reminder, that
due process must be followed.
Secondly, although we know much of what happened at
the photographic array, we cannot know all.

We do not know,

we cannot know, the nuances, the gestures, the intonation
that might have been used.

The Government urges that these

matters could be developed in cross-examination.

My learned

colleague states that there is no reason in the world why the
witness cannot testify as to the words that were used.
I suggest there is a reason, and the reason is
stated in Wade.

The reason is that the unschooled layman

does not and cannot be expected to note those matters that
are important.

And, besides, if he does note them, they

will not work.
Q

Mr. Cohn, suppose instead of having had

interviews in the context of this case, the police had the
same five photographs of five different people, all of whom
were at least thought to be suspect for one reason or another,
and took them around the neighborhood and exposed them to
people and said, "Have you ever seen any of these men before,"
and then "If so, where?” and narrowing it down to the day and
details:

What would you say about that exposure of the

photographs?
MR. COHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I draw a line between

identification of procedures that are investigative.

We are

now after Kxrby , so that we are dealing with a post-indictment
situation as distinguished from a pre-indictment*

Where there

is investigation going oa, where there has not yet been a
focusing, where there has not been ah indictment, where no
criminal proceedings or prosecution, whichever word one
wishes to use, has begun, we have an entirely different
story than we do after indictment.

Here there has hot only

been a focusing, but you have a man who is incarcerated
several blocks away.

The trial is about to begin.

And what

we have is an identification which is then entered as positive
evidence.
My colleague stated that this was during the
defendant's case, and I just want to emphasize it was by the
co-defendant's counsel that it was offered, and that the
picture of Mr. Ash was ultimately offered by the Government.
So that whatever taint there is from the fact that it was
ofered during the defendant's case, it was not during this
defendant's case.

And he did not offer it; then we would

have an entirely different proposition.
Q

It is not your claim, as I understand it,

that photographs cannot be used in a variety of different
ways during the investigation of a criminal offense.

For

instance, if a camera in a bank, one of these automatic
cameras, takes a picture of a holdup man, there is nothing on
earth, I suppose, in your argument that would require the

23
police to take a lawyer with him when they go around the
neighborhood asking people,, "Have you ever seen this man?
Dees he live here?"
Your argument is limited to the case of where this
kind of evidence is used in the trial in order to convict
comebody.
MR. COHN:

That is correct.

We have here—and this

is where we also draw the line—
Q

Through eyewitnesses.

MR. COHN:
Q

Who testified.

MR. COHN:
Government.

Yes.

Here is where we part ground with the

The Government says, "This is the same as all

other preparation of witnesses."

1 would hope not.

But 2

suggest that what we have here is the production of positive
evidence,, positive evidence of identification.

And this

production, whether it is through a lineup which is then
used or is through pictures which are then used or showup or
anything of the sort, once the criminal prosecution has
started, once there is an indictment or information or an
arrest, to use the words of the Kirby case, once that happens,
the right to counsel is attacked.
Q

Mr, Cohn, you say this is positive evidence,

and I take it that is the way yon distinguish Mr. Norman's
example where the prosecuting attorney is simply horse-

shedding the witness without any photographs.
MR. COHN:

In a horse-shedding situation, the

statements of the witness are not admissible as positive
evidence.

Perhaps for impeachment purposes—
Q

But a photograph is not admissible until the

witness in court identifies it.
MR. COHN:

No, Your Honor.

Here we have a situation

of a police officer saying that these are the photographs
that were shown and Mrs. Apple said, "This is the man.”

The

actual identification itself, I suggest, is not hearsay.

It

is a positive act in itself.
Q

Had she already identified the defendant at

that time from the stand?
MR. COHN:

At that time she had already been asked

by Mr. Bailey's counsel—had she already identified him in
court?

I am sorry.
Q

The answer is yes, sir.

Yes, she had.

She had already made an identification

independent of any photograph, had she not?
MR. COHN:

In court.

That is correct.

But now

are we to use her identification itself outside the court as
positive evidence to buttress the identification in court?
After all, we have a situation hare where the first
witness, the bank teller, had to be asked four times, "Is he
here?"

And three times she says, "I am not sure," and the

fourth time, "Well, he looks similar."

25
The second bank teller says, "I am not sure, but
I think."
Q

How do you contend that her testimony was

used independently to buttress it during the trial?

V!hat

testimony is it of hers?
3?®. CORN:

If we can refer to the appendix, Your

Honor, I believe that would be at—
Q

Did this occur at the time of the reference

case in chief?
HR. COHN:

No, Your Honor.

This occurred at the

time of Mr. Bailey's case.
Q

Mr. Cohn, is it not the standard rule in the

Federal courts, a rule of evidence, that pre-trial
identifications are admissible in evidence to corroborate
in~court identification?
MR. COHN:
Q

That is generally the rule, is it not?

MR. COHN:
Q

That is my understanding.

Yes.

So, if the Government wants to, it may have the

witness identify the witness in court and then say, '‘Did you
identify him before?” and the witness can answer.
MR. COHN:
Q

That, is correct,

Or the Government can simply offer the pre-trial

.MR. COHN;

Either way.

It can do it through the

eyewitness or it can do it, as I understand it, through the
policeman or, in this case, the United States attorney-—
Q

A policeman can say, "Mrs. Smith identified

this picture."
MR. COHN;

Yes.

What was done here was—-first of

all, she was asked—

Bailey's attorney and she is asked

Yes, it is.

I see."

Now, there it stops, because at that point
Mr. Stanford wanted to offer all the pictures.

And there was

an objection made on page 105, and there- is a colloquy and
they were withdrawn.
Now, we go over toward the end where Mr. Stanford

27
calls the police officer»
Q

Where are we now?

MR. COHNs

On page 123 is where Mr. Fallin? the

police officer who accompanied—this was involved with the
sixty-six.

Let roe get this.

126.

Mr. Bailey? who is the

FBI officer? who accompanied the assistant United States
attorney»

On page 127—we are talking in terms of Mrs» Apple

now—
Q

Mr. Bailey’s attorney—

MR. COHN:
!:Q

This is Mr» Bailey's attorney.

Did you at any time show her several photographs,

photographs in color?
“A

Yes? I did.

"Q

Did she identify one of these as the man?

"A

Yes, she selected one, she thought he was the

one."
Then shows him Exhibit No, 5.

Is that the one?

"A

That is correct.

MQ

X show you Defendant's Exhibit No» 4, did she

make an identification" as to him?
"A

No, she did not."

Number four is Bailey.
Q

She then states that»

Number five is Ash?

MR. COHN:

Number five is Ash»

does not. know that five is Ash.

So far the jury

28
Q

1 see.

MR. COHN:

Okay.

But they now know that four is

Bailey and that she did not identify Bailey, but she
identified somebody else.
At this point the assistant U» S. attorney at the
bottom of the page says, "I believe the five photographs
should go into evidence.”

I am assuming the word “that”

means the five, but I am not quite sure whether it is only
Ash's or all five at that point.
And Mr. Rosen, who is Ash’s attorney, says, ”1 will
object to that, Your Honor."
Then there is a colloquy that goes on on page 128
and 129 in which Mr. Rosen is constantly objecting, and there
is a lot of discussion as to what should happen.
On page 130«—
Q

Mr. Stanford is Bailey's attorney?

MR. COHN:
Q

Mr. Sepenuk is the prosecutor.

MR. COHN:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

And Mr. Rosen is Ash’s attorney; is that

right?
MR. COHN:

That is correct, sir.

Then on page 130, about the middle of the page,
Mr. Rosen still says, "I would oppose that.”
And then the Court down a few lines:

“I would be

29

disposed to admit it regardless of who offers it."

introduce all five?"
And Mr. Rosen says, "That might avoid prejudice
against Ash.*'
At that point the Court has already ruled that they
are to be admitted.
131, they—Q

Mr. Rosen did agree?

MR. COHN;

He agreed, and 1 suggest that he agreed

once the Court had ruled that Ash’s picture should go in that
what his statement is is that the least amount of prejudice
would be if all five pictures go in.

But the Court has

already ruled by this time on Mr. Stanford’s request.
Q
leaning..

As he ruled, he indicated that he has a

He said, "I would be disposed to admit it."

is hardly a ruling at that stage.

That

It is a suggestion of how

he feels about it, but it does not foreclose objection and
argument, does it?
MR. COHN:

I suggest, Your Honor, that we have had

now pages of argument on tha subject, and that at the end of
that paragraph the Court himself suggests, "Should we
introduce all five?"
Q

At least Mr. Rosen did not have tc agree.

MR.COHN:

I agree, Your Honor.

If I were there

30

secondgusssing him, 1 would not agree to any form of it.

But

here was the man under fire-Q

He was not agreeing until—-I mean, at the top

of page 130, the same page, he said, "It is not going into
evidence„!l
MB. COHNs
Q
here.

Oh, he is objecting all along.

I have not read this carefully.

I cannot

But it seems to me that finally when it became evident

that at least one of the pictures was going to go into
evidence, that the Court had so indicated if not ruled; he
said it is better to have all five of them than just one of
them.
MR. COHN:

That is the way the Court of Appeals

apparently read it, and I would certainly say that is a
permissible reading, the way I would read it, .sir.
Q

Mr. Cohn, would you say that if it were held

that Wade applies to photographic identifications, those
involved in this case, that based on what we have just been
over here, there was a Gilbert error in the sense that the
prosecution should be charged with having relied on pre-trial
identification so that a finding of no taint would not
suffice?
MR. COHN:
Q

That is correct, sir.

That is correct.

You would think, even though the Government

carefully avoided pre-trial identifications on its side of

31
the case and the defense brought if. up—
MR. COHN:

Q

Yes.

—-first presented it to the jury—

MR. COHN:

Yes.

—that nevertheless a finding
would not suffice?
ME. COHN:

What we really have here is Brufcen

situation where we have pictures instead of a confession
being used.

And it is a problem of how you are going—where

you have two co-defendants in a case and how do you handle
this.
Q

How does the Government avoid this sort of

thing?
MR. COHN:

By having counsel at the photographic

identification, I suppose is the easy answer.

By seeing that

a case such as this is tried separately rather than
together»

And—
Q

Were there motions here to sever?

MR. COHN:

I am afraid not, Your Honor.

Again, one might say that it would be better at
this point or earlier to have made a

motion to sever.

I

was unable to find one—
Q

When the motion to sever is not made, is it

not a reasonable inference that both the defendants thought
that it was to their advantage not to be severed.

32
MR. CORNs

Unfortunately I cannot cross-examine the

mind of Saul Rosen, the attorney here, as to what he had
in mind.
Q

He is talking about inferences from known

facts.
MR. COHN:

That is possible.

I can only rely back

on the fact that this certainly did prejudice my client and
if it was offered by Mr. Bailey, from my client's standpoint
it should not have been admitted into evidence because it
violated the standards of Wade.
Q

Do you

agree

that what triggered the

introduction of the five photographs was the proposal to
introduce the Bailey photograph?
MR. COHN:
Q

X will, yes.

Yes, sir.

So that this was not the Government's idea?

MR. COHN:

It was the Government!s idea then to go

on and introduce the Ash photograph.
steps of the Government.

That I will lay at the

If everything would have stopped

with the introduction of the Bailey photograph, we would have
a different case.
Q

But once having avoided a motion to saver and

elected to have a joint trial, this is the type of difficulty
which is inherent in a joint trial, is it not?
MR. COHN:
the same time--

That is correct, Your Honor.

And at

33
Q

Sometimes lawyers can foresee that and

sometimes they cannot»
MR. COHN»

But at the same time it would be

avoidable by the Government and counsel, by the court,
cautioning all that we have to have in here is that there was

a photograph of Mr. Ash shown to Mrs. Apple, and she did not
identify it.

If everything would have stopped there, we

would not have this case»

It was the Government going or; to

say that we now want the Ash photograph»
Q

Mr» Cohn, assuming there was not a so-called

Gilbert violation here and that a finding of no taint would
avoid a reversal, even if Wade applied the photographs.
Was there a finding of no taint here sufficient for that
purpose?
MR. COHN:

As far as the in-court identification

is concerned, when you say no taint.
Q

Yes.

MR. COHN;

The trial judge found that there was no

taint on the in-court identification.
Q

It came from an independent basis?

MR. COHN:
Q

It came from independent basis.

Are you satisfied that that would stiff ice

even if Wade were applicable in this case?
MR. COHN:

Q

No, Your Honor.

Absent a Gilbert-*-

34
MR. COHN:

No, Your Honor.

If we were at that

point, if that issue were here, I would argue that based
upon this record that that was not a permissible finding.
But that .issue was not brought here by the Government.
Q

Excepting that finding though, the finding

in form is sufficient, in form?
MR. COHN?.

The Court of Appeals ruled that it was

not sufficiently detailed, that it was much too general.
And I will stand on that, if 1 may.
Q

Mr. Cohn, the first photographic identification

in this case was on February 3, 1966.
MR. COHN:
Q

That is correct, sir.

Let us assume for the moment that Mr. Ash had

been indicted at that time.

Would your formulation hare

required the presence of counsel when the FBI agent presented
those five photographs?
MR. COHN:

That is correct, sir, because under

Kirby, once you have the indictment or information or arrest,
and X would assume arrest having to do with this matter,
Q

Suppose one of those witnesses, let us say the

customer who was in the bank, had been in Seattle and the FBI
had wanted to ascertain whether she could identify the
indicted defendant.

Your position, as I understand it, is

that counsel would have had to go out and be present at that
identification?

c

MR. COHN:

That is my position, but I do not agree

with all of the unstated implications that I heart

Because it

would seem to me that notice to counsel would be adequate,
and then he could go or he could retain counsel out there to
appear at the photographic identification.

So that I do not

think that is any insoluble problem or even impractical.
Q

Your formulation does not depend at all on

whether or not the photographic showing is or is not
suggestive»

Counsel must be present in any event?

MR. COHNs

That is correct.

that is the way it is either.

And I do not think

It is a prophylactic against

this sort of thing occurring.
May I emphasize—
Q

Was there any suggestion of harmless error in

this case?
MR. COHM:

No, sir.

And where you have had such

indefinite identifications, I suggest—and here again I part
ways with my brother here—that once that the photographic
identification could be read to have contributed to whatever
posifciveness there was to the identification or at least we
cannot say that the witnesses would not have been less
definite but for the identification.
Q

Did not the Government have a rather strong-

case when they had the would-be accomplice testify that Ash
had asked him to join in this enterprise and then

told him

36
the day afterwards that he had carried it out and then you
had one witness at least Who made a positive identification;
a pretty strong case* is it not?
MR. COHN:

But whether it was strong enough* Your

Honor* for the jury without the photographic identification—
Q
there.

Suppose the Government had stopped right

Just put the would-be accomplice and the lady who was

positive about the identification* stop there* you would
concede that there was a case for the jury* would you not?
MR. COHN:
0

Oh* sura.

And then if you had a conviction, you would

not be here.
MR. COHN:
know from our

That is correct.

But what we do not

vantage point is whether the jury would have

then convicted* and that is our problem.
Q

' We never know that as a certainty in a

harmless error case* do we?
MR. COHN:
correct.

This is a judgmental factor.

That is a judgmental factor; that is

That is correct.
If I may comment on a few matters raised by the

Government in the few minutes that X have here* the point is
raised that we did not have here the presence of the accused,
and therefore this is different than Wade.

May 1 suggest

that that has been answered in Gilbert* that in Gilbert
when this Court examined whether the taking of the

handwriting exemplars was a critical stage., the fact that the
defendant was present was not at all dwelt upon.

What was

dwelt upon was whether there is a sufficient risk to the
defendant at the time of trial that could not be remedied by
the trial proceedings so that the talisman that the Government
would now offer us—’though at the time of Wade they too
did not see it—-of the presence of the defendant is., I
suggestt nothing but a mystery.
Q

A few moments ago Mr. Justice White asked you

something about a Gilbert violation as contrasted with a
Wade violation.

What did you understand by that?

MR. COHN:
Q

X understood what ha meant—

Perhaps I had better just ask Justice White

at some other time $ but I did not understand his question or
your answer.
MR. COHN:

I am not so positive I did either.

heard him ask the question to each of us„ and I

I

am not quite

sure.
Q

1 thought Gilbert—«either Wade or Gilbert t

one or the other—indicated that if the Government in this
case in chief not only asked the witness to identify the
defendant in the courtroom but referred to a pre-trial
identification that the witness had been engaged in and that
the pre-trial identification had been without counsel, that
then there was an automatic reversal and that a no-taint

38
finding would not suffice.
MR. COHN:

That is correct, but then the next

question-Q

Automatic reversal only if there were not

harmless error.
HR. COHN:
Q

But the-—

in Wade, if the Government just has an in-court

identification and there has bean a pre-trial idem tification
without counsel, if the Government can demonstrate that the
in-court identification is independently based and not
tainted, the absence of counsel will not result in a
reversal»
MR» COHN:

I thought you were also applying that

to the Gilbert, the question being whether the in-court
identification can come in at a new trial.

That is an issue

that is still open in this case»
0

I thought, Mr. Cohn, that your argument as to

Ash was that there was a Gilbert violation because of the
way that, the Ash photograph got into evidence, and if that
were so and the principles of Wade and Gilbart applied to
photographic identification, then 1 take it Gilbert, would
require a reversal unless there were harmless error.
MR. COHN;

And we would have a requirement of a

new trial and then we would have the question as to whether
the in-court identification itself is salvagable.

?
i

39
Q

Yes,; but if we recall in Gilbert we sent the

case back for a new trial unless there were a determination
of harmless error»

There was no issue of taint then involved,

Q

Taint is irrelevant.

Q

That is right.

MR. COHN;

Okay * I am sorry.

Then X misunderstood

your question.
Q

If you have evidence of the identification#

the pre-trial identification itself# which by hypothesis in
GiIbert violated the Constitution# then even an untainted incourt identification does not correct that constitutional
error.

I understand now.
MR. COHN:
Q

There would have to be then a new trial.

Yes, and then you would have the question to

which you referred.
MR. COHN:
Q

Yes.

Unless there is a Gilbert finding here, unless

there is a Gilbert violation here, the issue of the
applicability of Wade to photographs is not here at ail if
you accept the no-taint.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Konnan.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I would just want to

allude to one or two points.

The only real substantive policy

40
reason which has been suggested for having counsel present
by Mr, Cohn is that it would act as a deterrent to “--the v>S£y
fact that counsel was present there—-would act as a deterrent
against the use of suggestive procedures»
I do not think that that deterrent is necessary»
It is enough of a deterrent to the prosecutor that if he
engages in a suggestive identification procedure he is going
to totally endanger the in-court identification»

^

That is

represented by the very facts in this case, that even if we
are successful here, we are hardly out of the woods in terms
of sustaining the judgment of conviction in this case»

So

that by engaging in suggestive procedures, he is endangering
the entire in-court identification, bringing upon himself a
whole mess of problems before trial.
In the second place, by having a suggestive
photographic procedure, he also undermines to a substantial
degree whatever corrobative basis the fact that an out-of-court
identification was made»

It is not likely to have very

much impact with a jury that before trial a witness picked
out a photograph in an array that was obviously suggestive,
And, of course, finally that substantive policy
reason for having a lawyer present was not even suggested, as
I understood or read the Court's opinion in Wade».
Also., there has been some allusion both in the
opinion of the Court of Appeals and by Mr» Cohen to the

41
Government? s brief in Wade where we are quoted as saying
that there is no difference between a lineup and a photographic
display.

What; the Government said in Wade was. that clearly

no one has ever suggested that a lawyer was required when
photographs are shown and that we saw no difference as far
as lineups go.

This Cour t disagreed only to the extent that

it did find a difference as far as lineups went, feat as a
matter of fact the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan pointed
out that the prosecution could show in attempting to evade
a taint finding that there had in fact been a prior
identification by photographs.

And these, unless there are

any questions, are the only two points that I wanted to
make„

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Roman.

Mr. Cohn, you were appointed by the Court to this
case, and on behalf of the Court I want to thank you for your
assistance to the Court and of course your assistance to the
client.
MR. COHN:

Thank you for the privilege.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 2s35 o’clock p„m. the case was
submitted.}
