MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-624, United States against Pennsylvania
Industrial Chemical Corporation.
Mr. Reynolds, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REYNOLDS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to review
that Court's judgment reversing the judgment of conviction by
the District Court and remanding for further proceedings.
The action was commenced by criminal information in
April 1971 against respondent, Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical
Corporation, hereafter referred to as PICCO.
The company was charged in four counts with violating
Section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the so-called
Refuse Act, which, in relevant part, makes it unlawful without
first obtaining permission from the Secretary of the Arv.y to
discharge into any navigable water of the United States, quote,
"any refuse matter of any kind or description whatever other
than that flowing from streets and sewers and passing therefrom
*

in a liquid state", close quote,
QUESTION;

Mr. Reynolds, what wa3 the date of the

alleged offense here charged?
MR. REYNOLDS s

The date —- well, there were two

dates, August 7 and August 19, 1970.
QUESTION^ Do you know why the complaint — I think it
was by complaint here — didn't zero-in on a post-December
date?
MR. REYNOLDS ;

No, Your Honor, I don't know why

they —
QUESTIONs

It would have simplified your case some­

what, wouldn't it?
MR. REYNOLDS:

It certainly would have made a much

different case —
QUESTIONS

Well, I suppose there weren't anybody

canoeing on the Monongahela in December.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, at least nobody, apparently, was

sampling the discharges on the Monongahela after that date.
But the date of the offenses were August 7th and August 19th,
1970.
Now, the discharges involved here flowed into the
Monongahela River, admittedly in navigable water, from txvo
pipes owned by PICCO and used by the company to carry off
treated waste matter left from the manufacture of chemical
compounds used in industry.
One of the pipes, an iron pipe, served only PICCO!s
plant? the other, a concrete pipe, served the plant primarily

5

but was also used by six private residences nearby, essentially
to discard used laundry water.
On August 7 and again on August 19, 1970, the
discharges from the two pipes were sampled by private citizens,
and the samples were turned over to the Allegheny County
Bureau of Tests for chemical analysis.

This analysis revealed

that the effluent flowing from PICCO’s pipe contained a
disproportionately high amount of aluminum, some iron, chloride,
phosphate, and other chemicals, all in greater amounts than
were found in the midstream waters of the river, and an
unusually high quantity of suspended solids.
At trial, PICCO took the position that the industrial
waste it was discharging into the Monongahela River did not
constitute prohibited refuse matter under the Act,
First, it argued that the Refuse Act covers only
river deposits that impede navigation, not non-impeding liquid
solutions of the sort involved here.
In the alternative, it urged that the discharge from
its plant was nothing more than sewage, and thus came within
the explicit statutory exception.
Both of these contentions were rejected by the
District Court.
also rejected.

They were renewed in the Court of Appeals and
Ho cross-petition was filed by respondent in

this Court seeking further review of those rulings, and thus
the application of the Refuse Act to discharges of the type

6
involved in this case is not at issue here, because the
judgment under review is based on the preraise that the Act
does apply to these discharges.
Rather, the issues before the Court relate essentially
to the second proviso in the Act, which provides that the
Secretary of the Army, quote, "may permit", close quote, the
deposition of otherwise prohibited material in navigable
waters if navigation will not be adversely affected thereby,*
provided that application is made to the Secretary prior to
depositing such material.
QUESTION5

You're suggesting that we don't know,

or that it's irrelevant whether these discharges would be —
would pass muster under existing regulations under another
Act, or under the State Act?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I'm suggesting that that is irrele­

vant for purposes of this case.

We don't know it, but whether

they would or would not pass —
QUESTION §

Are the State —

MR. REYNOLDS;

— muster under State Water Quality

Standards, I say is not relevant,
QUESTIONz

Are the State Water Quality Standards

approved by the Federal authorities?
MR, REYNOLDS s The 1967 State Quality Standards for
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been approved.
record “>**-

The

7
QUESTIONS

Well, let's assume — assume for the

moment that under those regulations approved by the Federal
authorities, these discharges could continue to be made.
Just assume that, —
MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

To assume that, I still --

— would that have some significance for

whether or not a criminal prosecution tinder another Act should
go forward, for making these very discharges?
MR. REYNOLDS s

It wotild have significance, Your Honor,

to the extent that the plant sought permission from the Federal
Government also to discharge.

The 1970 Water Pollution

statutes require that in order to get permission from the
Federal Government, a certification has to be presented that
you do meet State Quality Standards.
QUESTION;

So, then, this is a prosecution for

not getting a permit; not whether or not you could get one if
you applied?
MR. REYNOLDS; For discharging without getting a
permit under —- without getting a Federal permit, or without
getting permission from the Federal Government,

It does

not concern whether, if application had been made, this plant
could have gotten a permit.
But we don't know on this record or on the basis of
the offers of proof whether they even had a State permit, a
State certification that they met the 1967 Standards,

8

QUESTION: But if that sort of thing were relevant,
the government would lose its case here, since they did make
an offer of proof, wouldn't they?
MR. REYNOLDS s
QUESTION:

Well, ~

You've got to say it's irrelevant, and

the trial judge properly excluded it.
MR. REYNOLDS: That's right.

But its irrelevant

because they never -— in any event, they never presented that
certification, even if they did have it, to the Federal
Government, and therefore never sought a Federal permit.
It's irrelevant if they just hold it and keep it in their
office, which would be all that the offer of proof in any
event would have shown, had it incorporated such a permit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, what is the significance ~~

I gather there are pending other criminal prosecutions, but
how about for the future?
MR. REYNOLDS: Well, Your Honor, I think it's
relatively insignificant for the future.

It does have

significance with respect to the pending criminal and civil
actions —
QUESTION: Well, how many of them are there?
MR. REYNOLDSs There are now 115, I believe 115,
pending criminal actions and 70 pending civil injunctive
suits under the Act. But the 1972 Water Pollution Control
Act, which does require — set up a statutory permit program,

%

3

and provides a moratorium, in essence, on Refuse Act
prosecutions until after implementation of that permit plan really makes this particular case insignificant with respect
to the future.
QUESTION;

In the future, once that program is

implemented, people are still going to have to get a permit,
aren't they?
MR. REYNOLDS;

People will still have to get a

permit, but —
QUESTION;

It may be they could get one in these

circumstances, but if they don't get one, they may be
criminally prosecuted?
MR. REYNOLDS;

That's correct, Your Honor? but I

believe they would be criminally prosecuted under another
statute.
QUESTION;

Not under —

MR. REYNOLDS s

I believe it would not be under this

statute? it would rather be under the new 1972 Water Pollution
Control Act amendment.
QUESTION;

Because that Act modifies this one?

MR. REYNOLDS;

Well, that Act has transferred the

permit authority that was vested under this Act in the
Secretary, has transferred it to the Environmental Protection
Agency, and it requires now that you get your permit from
that agency.

And I think that —

10

QUESTIONs But does that agency — but you have to
get a permit, one of tine reasons you have to get a permit is
to satisfy the Refuse Act?
HR. REYNOLDS; Well, I believe that the Refuse Act
*— that the prosecution would proceed.
penalties now under the 1972 Act.

There are criminal

I think that the Refuse Act

could well still be viable for nonpoint source emissions,
because the 1972 Act really pertains to point source. That is,
emissions coming from pipes directly into the river.
Where your Refuse Act prosecutions in the future will
lie is essentially with respect to matter that's placed on
the bank, where —
QUESTIONt Where it trucks it in and dumps it.
MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

Yes,

MR, REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

Of course; or that type of situation.
Or an accident.

Or an accident.

That's correct.

Mr. Reynolds, I think you mentioned that

there now are more than 100 prosecutions pending under the
1899 Act,

How many prosecutions were there between 1899 and

1970, when this prosecution was brought?
MR. REYNOLDS; Well, —
QUESTION; There's a footnote in —
MR. REYNOLDS;

— I don't — I thxnk that before

1968, Your Honor, that there were relatively few prosecutions
brought.

That in 1968, I believe that there were something

11
like 30 or 40? and then in 1969, that is when the government
really began to use this particular statute to reach the
activity that we're talking about in this case.

So that

most of the prosecutions that are set forth in that footnote
were prosecutions that were commenced in nineteen sixty- *—
perhaps late '68, but generally 1969, '70, and '71.
QUESTION s

The footnote on page 15(a) of the

opinion below, which, as I read it, states that there was only
one case in the '70 year-period, where the prosecuting
authorities pressed criminal charges under comparable
conditions, and that conviction was overturned.

Page 15(a)

of your petition for certiorari.
I don't want to interrupt your argument, I just,
wondered whether you challenged that statement in the opinion
below.

But if you — if you don't recall it —
QUESTION;

But that's a Texas case, and it says

"Tax Criminal", but I think it means "Tex", it's a Texas case,
MR. REYNOLDS;

OhJ

Yes, I see.

QUESTION; And it involves the principle, that
principle that the court is talking about.
MR. REYNOLDS: That's right, that is not a

— that's

a case — in fact, those two cases do not even involve the
Refuse Act.

They involve statutes requiring plumbers to get

a license before they could operate in the State of Texas.
There were more than one criminal prosecutions —

12

there was more than one criminal prosecution under this Act
before this particular action was brought. There was the
ha Merced case in 1936; there were a couple of cases prior to
that, There was the Ballard Oil case.

Of course, we have the

two cases that were in this Court, Republic Steel and Standard
Oil.

There was —
QUESTION s

Were those criminal?

MR, REYNOLDS: The Standard Oil case was a criminal
case; the Republic Steel case was not.
There was a decision in the Third Circuit, and there
were a number of others.
QUESTION:

So it was certainly more than one,

This — these two cases cited in

Footnote 8 of the court's opinion have to do with the principle
of imposing criminal penalties for people who fail to comply
with a nonexistent regulatory program, as I understand it,
MR. REYNOLDS: That's correct.

That's correct.

Yes, Your Honor.
Let me look just briefly to the language of the
Refuse Act, and this second proviso.
in broad terms.

The Act itself speaks

It bans all discharges of refuse matter into

navigable rivers or into navigable waters, except sewage.
But lander the second proviso, the Secretary of the Army,
quote, "may permit", close quote, certain forbidden discharges,
quote, "provided application is made to him prior to
depositing such material,"

13

Now, this proviso doss not speak in terms of a
formal regulatory program.

What Congress did in 1839 was to

vest in the Secretary discretionary authority in those
instances where a prior application is made, discretionary
authority to immunize from criminal prosecution discharges that
would otherwise be unlawful.

How, when, and under what

circumstances he might exercise that authority were left to
him.
In this regard, the 1899 Refuse Act was no different
from tiie predecessor statutes on which it was based.

Neither

tiie Act of 1890 nor the Act of 1894, both of which imposed a
flat ban on the discharge of enumerated substances into
navigable waters; neither of those statutes called for the
establishment of a formal regulatory program, under which
permission to discharge would be given.
Instead, the decision whether to permit a forbidden
discharge was left, in those earlier statutes, to the
discretion of the Secretary of War; he could act or not, as
he saw fit, to except particular discharges from the general
statutory prohibition.
And this we think is what Congress intended by the
second proviso in the Refuse Act,
If the Secretary wished to establish a formal
regulatory program, it certainly was within his authority
to do so under this proviso.

But for some seventy years he

14
chose not to operate on that basis.

Rather, he chose to act

informally, passing on applications only when and as submitted*
QUESTIONS Would it really make much difference in
your argument if Congress had contemplated the establishment
of a formal regulatory program?
MR. REYNOLDS %

I believe that if Congress had

contemplated that, and had contemplated that the violations
of the statute turned on compliance with that program, it
would make a difference, Your Honor.
QUESTION: But if the language were still the same,
that you're guilty of —
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

Oh, I see —

— doing this unless you get a permit.

MR. REYNOLDS:

I'm sorry, I ~

QUESTION: Does it make any difference how formalised
the procedure for getting the permit is?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I thought you meant if the language

had required — if the statute required it.

No, I think it

would not make any difference under this language, that
whether there was a program set up, a formal program set up
or not would make no difference.
I think the — what the proviso does, it provides a
limited defense to a Refuse Act prosecution, for discharges
which the Secretary, in his discretion, may permit.
Now, under the Court of Appeals decision, that

15

limited defense, based on affirmative action taken by the
Secretary, is converted to an absolute defense through a formal
permit — because the Secretary fails to exercise his
discretion through a formal permit program.
What the Court of Appeals decision does is turn the
statute on its head.

That which Congress in 1899 declared to

be generally prohibited, that is, the continuous discharge of
industrial waste into our nation's waters, becomes generally
permissible in the absence of a formal regulatory scheme
which Congress did not prescribe.
Now, apparently the Court of Appeals reached tills
result not so much on the basis of the language or the
history of the Refuse Act, but, rather, on the basis of its
reading of later Congressional enactments in the water
quality field, particularly the Water Pollution Control Act
of 1948, as amended through 1970, but not the 1972 amendments,
which I've alluded to and which were enacted after this
decision,
But this water quality legislation, the Court of
Appeals suggests, can't be reconciled with the 1899 prohibition,
unless we read enforcement of that prohibition as turning on
the existence of a formal regulatory program,
I might just interject that this problem of
reconciliation, whatever it might be, has been, in large part,
resolved by the 1972 amendments, where Congress itself

16
incorporated the two Acts, in essence, and certainly
reconciled them in that legislation.
But before that, in the earlier water quality
legislation, Congress provided explicitly that that water
quality legislation was not to be construed as impairing or
affecting the prohibition of the Refuse Act.
Moreover, the water quality legislation and the
Refuse Act don't work at cross-purposes, as the Court of
Appeals seemed to suggest; both are aimed at the same end,
cleaning up the nation's waters.

But they use different

means to do it.
Now, we've spelled out in our brief the structure
of the Water Pollution Control Act.
Essentially, that legislation contemplates a
cooperative effort by the States and the Federal Government
in establishing and enforcing Water Quality Standards.
But prior to 1972, that is the new amendment in
1972 to this water quality legislation, prior to that time
the water quality legislation contained no penalty
provisions.

Discharges which reduced the quality of the

receiving body of water below the said Standards was subject
only to lengthy proceedings which could possibly end in an
abatement order.
Thus, the Refuse Act, which was saved by Congress,
the Refuse Act of 1899 essentially provided the teeth to the

17
Clean Water Program*
QUESTIONS

Would this discharge have violated the

water quality legislation?
MR, REYNOLDS; We don't know —• it just can't be
determined. Your Honor, on this record or on the base of the
offers of proof.

We have a permit that's in the appendix,

I believe, to respondent's brief, a State permit issued in
1956, which permitted the construction of the plant and
discharge at that time.

The State of Pennsylvania's Water

Quality Standards were approved in 1967 by the Federal
Government, and there’s no indication that they company has
gotten a permit, a certification from the State that it x*ms
in line with the 1967 Water Quality Standards,
QUESTION:

But —»

If it is your submission that the

Refuse Act did no more than provide the teeth for enforcement
of the Water Quality Standards Act, I should suppose the first
inquiry in this case, if you're right, would be whether or
not this discharge violated the Water Quality legislation,
wouldn't it?
MR, REYNOLDS: Well, I think that would be the first
inquiry to be made on submission of an application to the
Federal Government for a permit.

But the point that we're

making in this case is that the Refuse Act precludes those
discharges which fail to meet the Water Quality Standards,
and also even those that arguably do meet them until you

18

first go to the Federal Government and get permission»
Now, the 1970 water quality legislation* that's
the earlier amendments, required that the companies submit
to the Federal Government certification that it met the Water
Quality Standards, and its efforts to obtain a permit.

And

the Refuse Act would — there would be no violation if they
had gone to the Federal Government and they had submitted a
certification that they did in fact comply, and then they had
been permitted by the Federal Government to discharge»
But in this case we don't have any inquiry made by
the company whatsoever to the Federal Government with respect
to a permit for these particular discharges.
Now, the company's argument is that they were
affirmatively misled by the Corps of Engineers into believing
that a permit wasn't required in this situation, since its
discharges did not impede navigation.

And principal reliance

for this argument is placed on the Corps of Engineers'
early regulations, which, in 1968, or until 1968, indicated
that the Corps viewed its responsibility under the Refuse
Act as

and I’m quoting from those 1968 regulations -- as,

quote, "directed principally against the discharges of those
materials that are obstructive or injurious to navigation",
close quote.
In view of these earlier regulations, and the fact
that there were many industrial plants up and down the river

19
that were discharging industrial waste in the same manner,.
P1CC0 argues that it could properly assume — and I use that
word advisedly —- it did not go to the Corps of Engineers and
ask about these discharges, it didn't make any inquiry? it
says that it could properly assume that it needed no Federal
authorization for its nonimpeding discharges,,
Well, I think this Court in 1966 made it clear in
the Standard Oil case that the Refuse Act proscribes discharges
of refuse matter having no adverse effect on navigation to
the same extent as it proscribes those discharges that in fact
impede navigation.
And the fact that the 1899 statute had not for many
years been enforced as vigorously, with respect to the nonimpeding discharges, cannot be held to diminish its force
today.
We think the essential point here is that following
the Standard Oil decision, the Corps of Engineers changed its
view of its responsibilities under the Refuse Act with respect
to administering activities in navigable waterways.
And as we spelled out in our brief, the regulations
issued — the regulations on which PICCO relied were withdrawn
in 1968,

New regulations were issued by the Corps,

They

were published, in the Federal Register, and they served notice
that the Corps would consider pollution and conservation
factors in passing on applications for permission to use

20

navigable waters.
In addition — and this, Mr. Justice Powell, goes
to, I guess, your earlier question -- in addition, a number of
actions, both criminal and civil, were commenced in 1969 and
in 1970,

a large number of actions, under the Refuse Act

against companies that were discharging nonimpeding industrial
waste into the rivers.
In fact, as early as 1967, the Third Circuit
the same court that rendered the decision below —• the Third
Circuit held that that activity, that's the nonimpeding
discharges, that that was unlawful.
Interlake Steel, which is perhaps the Ccise most often
cited in this area — lower Federal Court case most often
cited in this area — was to the same effect; it was decided
in 1969, and, indeed, there's no court decision that we've
been able to find prior to the offenses here that held that
the Refuse Act was not

was limited just to discharges that

impede navigation.
In short, the scope of the criminal prohibition have
been authoritatively settled well before PICCO made the
present illegal discharges into the Monongahela River.
Moreover, the Corps announced in the summer of 1970
sweeping changes in its regulations pertaining to permits for
work in navigable waters.

We have set forth that announcement

in our — as an Appendix to our main brief; with specific

21

reference to the Refuse Act.

It also announced in July 1970,

and this announcement is in both our main brief and our reply
brief; but there’s a misprint in the main brief, and that’s
v/hy we incorporated it in our reply brief.
In July 1970 it made the following — issued the
following announcement, and let me just read quickly the
first paragraph of that.

It says;

"The Corps of Engineers today announced new permit
requirements under the Refuse Act concerning all discharges
into navigable waters.

Permits will be required for all

industrial discharges into navigable waters and their
tributaries.

New permits will be required where existing

permits were granted without adequate consideration of the
quality of the effluent.

Permits will also be required for

current discharges into navigable waters where no permits have
been granted."

Close quote.

Now, we believe that it's clear that if PICCO had
made even the most superficial inquiry after 1968, it would
have known that it needed a permit to discharge this kind of
industrial waste into the waterways.

It made no such

inquiry.
And we think that without such an inquiry, in the
face of the change in the regulations, the clear pronouncements
by this Court and other lower courts, and the clear pronounce­
ments by the Corps of Engineers, that it cannot now be seen to

22
rely on the defense that it was affirmatively misled into
believing that this conduct was lawful and was not prohibited
by the Act.
For these reasons and the reasons stated in our main
brief and reply brief, we submit that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals should be reversed, and the judgment of the
District Court should be reinstated.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I have any time remaining,
I'd like to reserve it for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right.

Mr. Gondelman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD GONDELMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GONDELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Listening to government's argument today reminds me
very much of the lyrics of The Mikado, where Mr, Gilbert said,
"The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la have nothing
to do with the case."
ibid the government's argument has nothing to do with
this case.

lie did not tell you, Mr. Justice Powell, that

the first attorney in the history of the United States, since
March 3rd, 1899, who has fought a case under that Act through
to a jury verdict is me.

That's the first and only case that

has come before th.i3 Court on a trial in a courtroom, and Your

23

Honors have specifically reserved that, and that is why I did
not go through motions and have the case corae up here in the
vacuum -that it did in Republic Steel and Standard Oil.
You have to have the facts of the case.
And, in fact, in the opinion of this Court in
Standard Oil, the last paragraph says, We pass only on the
quality of the pollutant, not on the quantity of proof
necessary to support a conviction, nor on the question as to
what scienter requirement the Act imposes, as those questions
are not before the Court on that restricted

appeal.

Interestingly enough, in the footnote, it says,
Having dealt with the construction placed by the court below
in the Sherman Act, our jurisdiction on this appeal is
exhausted, we are not at liberty to consider other objections
to the indictment, or objections which may arise upon the
trial with respect to the merits of the charge,
I don't know whether they mean the criminal charge
or the charge to the court,

I did attack both of those

before the court below.
Now, being trial counsel in the case perhaps gives
me a little advantage.

I'm a bit appalled when the government

tells this Court that there was no offer in the court below
to prove that the discharges of which we stand convicted
comply with the Water Quality Standards of the Government
of the United States.

So you have this anomalous situation.

24
PICCO has been fined $10,000 for violating a
criminal statute which the Government of the United States says
is not a pollution discharge under its own water quality.
Now, I would refer you to page 158 of the Appendix
that the government printed.

Despite the efforts of the court

below to keep me from making a record that this Court would
have, I insisted that certain offers be made.

One of them is:

"I also xtfant to be on record" — "I want to be on the record
the fact that in connection with Hr." —
QUESTION:

What page?

MR. GONDELMAH:

158, sir? at the top.

Mr. Lisanti, incidentally, is a water quality
control expert who, at one time, while the canoes were running
up and down the Monongahela River, one of his employees filled
the bottle and gave it to one of the bounty hunters in the
canoe so that he would have it to taka back.
—"Mr. Lisanti*s testimony, he would have testified,
if permitted, that the discharges", August 7th, August 19th,
that’s the discharges — "and the specific analysis on every
matter which is related to this, and these informations, are
absolutely within the prescribed limits of the Pennsylvania
Water Quality standards."
This case was tried in June 1972, and I intended to
prove as late as June 1972 that every item on the exhibits
that the government had, the chemical analysis, and they are

25
attached to their brief, every item is below the standards
that the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board in charge of it
permits'

under our State permits, permits PICCO to discharge

in the Monongahela River.

And the Court said, "Yes, but I've

overruled that."
And to make sure that the record was clear, I saids
"But it is not on the record and I want it to be, that every
matter discharged by this Defendant" — PICCO — "is within
the prescribed regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
which have been adopted by the Government of the United
States, and therefore insofar as this actually relates to our
dumping, the cases refer to pollutants and refuse interchange™
ably.

As to the Government’s own regulations", what we were

convicted of discharging as a pollutant, "is not a pollutant.”
Wow, we've said it in our brief, and I need not go
into that, that the government has adopted specifically the
Pennsylvania standards.

Congress has specifica™ly said that

the primacy of enforcing water pollution controls is in the
States.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gondelman, does this part of your

argument go to the existence of the offense, so to speak, or
to the existence of the defense, the permit?
MR. GONDELMANs The existence of the offense.

I

tried very hard, believe me, to get the court to harmonize the
Water Quality Acts which were passed in 1965-1970, and the

26

Refuse Act, they can be read harmoniously together without
putting the Government of the United States into the box that
it has painted itself by actually being the one who muddies
the waters of this whole situation more than anyone else»
QUESTIONs

I understand the government’s position

to be that since you hadn't cross-petitioned for certiorari
from the Third Circuit, that the existence of the offense
wasn’t properly here,
MR. GONDELMAN: Well, of course I find that argument
very difficult to believe.

Because the government has appealed

from the Circuit's finding, No. 1, that Congress intended no
crime under the facts of this case, and, two, if Congress did
intend such a crime, such a crime would violate due process,
I don’t know how this Court can consider the
government's appeal without getting into the merits of the
case, and whether or not a crime actually was committed.
And on the issue of whether a crime has been committed, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, the issue seems to me to bei
refuse?

What is

And in technology, in Mr. Lisanti's testimony, he

was completely — almost as'frustrated as I, because he would
not talk about pollutant and refuse or define those terms,
because, he said, I must know what the receptacle is into
which the effluent is being discharged.
vou see, they go out to the middle of the Monongahela
River and find a little bit of iron and a little bit of

27

sulphur and other .solids, where if you came closer to the
river, and the millions of gallons, and I think even their
test — expert testified billions of gallons of water, in water
pollution science you must know what the effluent is going
into, and the rate of water flow? not dissolve and evaporate
the water to get the solids out and make these exhibits
sound like these were actually solids.

All of the discharges

in PICCO's plant were in a liquid state, not solids.
And the fact is that what 1 tried to do is say to
the court:

The word ''pollutant" has a scientific present

technology definition.
How can you charge a jury that we have no permit to
discharge refuse if in the science and technology today it
is not refuse as that term is defined by the very science
trying to work to clean up the streams?
Mr. Lisanti would have testified, and I've cited
in the brief the fact that Pennsylvania and the Federal
Government define pollutants as things above a certain
standard, above a certain discharge rate.
continuously said:

And Mr. Lisanti

I cannot tell you if this is refuse, since,

Your Honor, you have told me I can't talk about what it goes
into and the rate of the flow of the stream.

In other words,

you can't let me testify as an expert, which I am trying to do.
QUESTION: Well, your case doesn't hinge on this,
does it?

+

28

MR» GONDELMAN:

It doesn’t hinge on that, but it

hinges on this, Your Honors

The question asked was?

If there

was no permit program, is there a crime committed?
I must first say that such a finding would, 1 think,
adopt the court's approach to this case.

The lower court’s

understanding of this case in light of Republic Steel and
Standard Oil was that it’s like when he was in Bolivia, they
told him that he couldn't carry a cigarette lighter without a
permit? he went down to get the cigarette lighter and they
say, "We don't have permits", they confiscated the cigarette
lighter.
And tills is the way this whole case was tried.
The court continually said to me that whether we —
QUESTION:

Well, I think it's one thing if you're

just going to attempt to sustain the Court of Appeals
judgment on the grounds it views, but something else if you
think you have to reach some other ground to sustain it,
MR. GONDELMAN:
grounds, Your Honor.

I don't have to

reach other

What I'm saying is that under these

circumstances the Court of Appeals has said that without a
permit program, and that I should be entitled to prove
whether or not there was a permit program in effect, because,
after all, the regulations and the statute itself —
unfortunately the government doesn't quote these things
completely to the Court,

29

If they read the complete "Provided further, however"
quote of tiie Act of 1899 — incidentally, it's interesting
that up until 1969 this was the Pd vers and Harbors Act of
1899.

Congress has not amended that Act.

The government

has amended it by continually referring to it as the Refuse
Act.

It becomes the Refuse Act on December 23rd, 1970, in the

Presidential Proclamation, when he referred to the Refuse Act
of 1899.
But the Act itself, Section 13, says;

"And provided

further, That the Secretary of the Army, whenever in the
judgment of the Chief of Engineers anchorage and navigation
will not be injured thereby," — now the government hasn't
read the next clause to you — comma, "may permit the deposit
of any material above mentioned in navigable waters," comma,
"within limits to be defined and under conditions to be
prescribed by him," comma,

then it says "provided application

is made to him prior to the deposit of such material".
Now, the courts have been, the lower courts
especially have been very concerned about whether the phrase
comes after the semicolon or before the semicolon; I don't
know how anyone would diagram this sentence at all, it would
be an impossibility.

But it certainly seems to me that as

the phrases flow, the Secretary may permit the deposit of
materials "within limits to be defined and under conditions
to be prescribed by him".

30

Now, what we find actually is that in 413 of the
Act, that is 33 U.S.C» 413, the Department of Justice shall
conduct the legal proceedings under Section 407, and it shall
be the duty of the United States Attorneys to vigorously
prosecute all offenders against the same.
This was passed on March 3rd, 1899, with the Act
we're concerned about.
I happened to check, I find there are 28 Attorneys
General of the United States, five of whom have graced this
honorable Court, and yet we find that no vigorous prosecution,
except for the Act of 1899 affecting navigation; next we
find Section 419, this was a new statute passed in 1905,
in which Congress said;

The Secretary of the Army is

authorized and empowered to prescribe regulations to govern
the transportation and dumping into any navigable waters or
waters adjacent thereto of dredings, earth, garbage, and
other refuse materials of every kind and description. The
exact language in the Act, Section 407.
The Secretary must prescribe regulations concerning
the dumping of, among other things, "other refuse materials
of every kind or description”, whenever in his judgment
navigation will not be affected thereby.
So I say that the Secretary of the Army , if this
was a pollution statute, and if we required a permit, he
had a duty to set forth in regulations what the permits would

31

be.
I offered these exhibits in evidence, and they are
part of my brief? I think they are Exhibits 7, 8, and 9„
In 1939, and this comes to the Court of Appeals
argument, Justice White, that the administrative rulings and
interpretations caused PICCO not to apply for a permit any more
than to ask if anything else were required.

In 1939 the

Information Circular says "Applications for authority to
execute work or erect structures in the navigable waters of
the United States."

Nothing about pollution in this circular»

This was secured by subpoena to the Corps of
Engineers to bring with them all of the regulations they had
ever published under section 407.

This they brought.

QUESTION: What was the date of that?
MR. GONDELMAN*

This is 1939, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Now, they then brought to me, since we hear that
the regulation was somehow changed in 1968, after some of the
decisions in this Court which went beyond the factual situations in those cases, they then show how well they amended
it in 1968, "Permits for work in navigable waters".

This is

the administrative ruling and publication which was given to
everyone.
Then we find —* now we see the difference? this was
after the Presidential Proclamation, which, incidentally,
had a moratorium, and the date you asked about, Justice

32
Blackmun, was very important — these informations are filed
in April 1971.

In December the President issued:

An order

to implement a permit program.
And you had until July 1st to apply for a permit.
So that under the President’s own proclamation of December 23rd,
there was an attempted moratorium to get people to now
understand what had never been the law in this country, that
you needed a permit.
now says:

Because in 1971, the same regulation

"Permits for work and structures in, and for

discharges or deposits into navigable waters."
And now we get to the need for a permit, and it’s
not a letter, like Judge Teitelbaum kept telling me, but the
permits are five, six, and seven pages, and require thousands
and thousands of dollars to determine the quantity of the
effluent, and there are vast technological data that is needed
in order to apply for a permit.
QUESTION: Those regulations are in the record, I
take it?
MR. GONDELMAN:

They are only in the record in this

way, Justice Powell, that I offered them, they were put in
this envelope, and I have added them to my brief, and there­
fore you will find simply the cover as an appendix to my brief,
I did not duplicate because I was afraid the brief would
simply get out of hand.

But you’ll find that Exhibit 9 is the

1971 regulation? Exhibit 8 is the '68 regulation.

33

I have duplicated a few sections, which show that,
it —- actually, the regulation says, since Republic Steel, the
Secretary of the Array must now, with the Corps of Engineers,
find out how to get industry to pay for dredging the Calumet
River, in effect, because the solids were building up.
QUESTION:

Did you just say, Mr. Gondelman, that

you offered these regulations in evidence at the trial?
MR. GONDELMAN:
QUESTION:
do?

Yes, Your Honor.

Isn't that kind of an unusual thing to

I can imagine the regulations might have a bearing on

the judge's determination of a legal point, but ordinarily
you wouldn't offer them for use of the jury.
MR. GONDELMAN:

Only, Your Honor, if the theory, as

I have it, is that the finder of fact — now we're going to
a jury — under the court's theory of this case there was
really no point in trying it, I think you plead guilty because
you have no defense.
throughout:

You don't have a permit.

He says this

The only way you can. avoid liability and

criminal culpability is, show me if you have a permit; or that
you didn’t know that you were putting this stuff in the river.
Now, the fact is, we knew we were putting it in the
river and we knew that we didn't have a permit? but I was
offering in evidence at the trial a number of things.
talking now about scienter.

We're

I thought I would get a charge

on mens rea because it's reserved, this honorable Court hasn't
■

, ,r->

,-r.

34

decided whether it’s malum prohibitum-

If it is, of course,

then all industry should have been closed down for seventy
years in this country.

But if there is any scienter

required, I felt that the actual publications of the Government
of the United States, telling us whether we needed a permit,
would be necessary to prove in the court.
Not only that ■—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We'll resume at that

point after lunch.
MR, GONDELMANs

Oh.

Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 12s00 o’clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at IsOO o'clock, p.m., the same
day. ]

35

AFTERNOON SESSION
112C0 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gondelman, you may

proceed.
May I suggest to you that your time is running out*
and the merits aren't really the irrportant factor here. The
only issue before the Court now is whether the case should go
back to the District Court for a new trial, and that's a
limited aspect of the merits,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD GONDELMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT — Resumed
MR, GONDELMAN:

Or really whether the case has a

criminal violation inherent in it at all, Mr. Chief Justice,
and in connection with that —
QUESTION:

Well, did you cross-petition?

MR, GONDELMAN:

I did not cross-petition.

However,

the —
QUESTION:

Then let's just stay with the — let's

concentrate: you've only got about 11 minutes left,
MR. GONDELMAN:

All right.

I'll cover it in less

time than that.
We have to look at the opinion of the Court of Appeals
to see what this Court granted certiorari from.

And the

Court of Appeals specifically held that the due process
violations, in answer to Mr. Justice Rahnquist's question,

36

how did I offer this, the fact that I offered this in the
trial is what the Court of Appeals ~ and that is what is now
i

before this Court, 1 might respectfully suggest, because the
Court of Appeals held two things:

One, Congress never

intended a crime under the facts of this case.

From that,

the government has appealed, and that is what is before this
Cpurt.
So the Court must now decide whether a crime has
been committed.
QUESTION:

Well, why did the Court of Appeals

send it back to the District Court if no crime ~ if their
holdings was definitively that no crime has been committed?
MR. GONDELMAN: Because they held that at least my
offers of proof should have been affirmatively allowed.
QUESTION:

If there was error in the rejection of

evidence.
MR. GONDELMAN: That is correct. And if the
evidence
is;

the effect of the opinion of the Court of Appeals

If I can prove the exhibits which I have shown this

Court, namely, that there was no permit program; that the
Corps of Engineers did not believe thata permit program
affecting pollution rather than navigation was necessary;
that the — that there was no crime committed under the facts
of this case.
And I think that by reversing, they simply said:

37

Put that evidence before a court, and I'm entitled to a
directed verdict,
QUESTION:

But that's before the District Court#

not this Court,
MR. CONDELMANs That would be before the District
Court# unless this Court were to find# as the Court of Appeals
found, that if there was no permit program# which is
throughout# everybody but the Department of Justice agrees
that there was no permit program.
And it is definitely before this Court# because
the second holding of the Court of Appeals is that the circum™
stances here demonstrate that no crime was committed. And
in that connection they discussed the regulations of the Corps
of Engineers# they discussed the lack of any affirmative
permit program. They discxissed the fact that we were
affirmatively told that there was no permit program required
until 1970# and then, in the third part of the opinion# he
says "Even if the Act of 1899 were construed to make
PICCO's activities criminal# due process considerations would
require a reversal."

And in that situation he says that

PICCO claims it was misled by interpretation given to the
statute by the Corps of Engineers.
And this is where we get to the offers of evidence#
none of which was admitted in the court below? but which are
attached to the brief for the consideration of this Court.

38

So I do believe that the government’s petition for
cert and this Court having granted cert directly places before
this Courts Was a crime committed at all, if the offers in
the court below had been allowed?
Now, I think we briefly ought to get to the effect
of what the government is saying here.

Since Kalur vs. Resor,

the government has been enjoined from issuing permits, period,
Nov;, if we understand the government’s argument
today, then under the administrative absolutism that the
Department of Justice says it has, every industry in this
country, since the injunction has been issued, where no permits
are now available by a court injunction, every industry that
has been discharging without a permit is guilty of a crime,
obviously.

It has to be the logical conclusion of the

government’s argument before this Court today.
We know that you cannot get a permit today because
of that decision.

It's on appeal, but at least for a year,

year and a half now, nobody could get a permit.
And yet a U. S. Attorney certainly could prosecute
any industry discharging into a navigable stream matters which
do not affect navigation, because they don't have a permit,
because, after all, what difference does it make, they don’t
have a permit only because a court has enjoined the government
from issuing them; and if they have not committed — if
industry has not committed a crime during the pendency of that

39

injunction, then why doesn't it logically follow that before
the injunction, if there was no permit program, there also was
no crime committed,
Mr. Ruckelshaus, the Director of the EPA, says
that there's no question, that no one could get a permit under
the Act of 1899.

I have his citation in my brief.

So that without a permit program, because of court
injunction, or prior to that, certainly there is no crime
committed here, and that issue has been decided by the Court
of Appeals.
The court below took the position completely that
it does not make any difference whether we could get a permit.
The only way that we could not violate the law is not to
discharge effluent into a river.
I suggest that if that position had been taken by a
United States Attorney in 1944 when industry was going full
blast to supply the war materiel for the boys on Omaha Beach
in World War II, and the effect of that type of criminal
prosecution would have been to advise industry to close its
doors, the U. S. Attorney would have been subject to, I'm
certciin,

great criticism if not internment for having taken

un-American activities approaches to the law.
The fact that they didn’t in 1943-1944, in fact
the fact that the Secretary of the Army awarded "E" awards to
industry during those periods in our national crisis certainly

40

would indicate that there is no criminal violation.
And to compound it in this case., the court below
charged the jury that if the Secretary of the Army, in his
discretion, decided not to issue permits, despite the fact
that my entire offer was to show that the Secretary of the
Army had actually exercised his discretion, saying that
no permits were required.
In fact, in the 1968 regulations, when they talk
about the Republic Steel case, the only change the Corps of
Engineers saw was that under Republic Steel they were now
obligated to assess who should pay for dreding.
I think what has happened in this situation, and
the metamorphises, so-called, the change from a Rivers and
Harbors Act to a Refuse Act, unfortunately comas about in
this ways

Republic Steel came before this Court on a petition

by the Government, of the United States, and if you read their
briefs you will find that they affirmatively told this Court
that they are not in a pollution case they are in a navigation
case; the entire brief on both sides talked :about navigation.
The opinion of this Court says s'.-'We have a pollution
statute, but that is obiter dictum as to the facts that were
before this Court,
Then from there we are led to Standard Oil. An
accidental discharge in which the Court defined good gasoline,
aviation fuel, as a pollutant

41
Prom those two cases we have now jumped the complete
line,, to say that we now have in the United States — and, as
X said, now they talk about a Refuse Act.

But I think that

when you see the Presidential Regulation, Proclamation of
December 23rd, 1970, you must ask yourself: Why did the
President of the United States take time from a busy schedule
to issue a proclamation implementing a permit program and
talking about all of the laws dealings with water control
in the implementation of that program?
He did it because there was no such program.
Water Pollution Control Act of *65,

The

*70, *72, can be

harmoniously read with the ACt of 1899 if one defines
pollution in terms of those Acts,
This case has no impact whatsoever on future cases
because of the Act of 1972, The government admits that.
This case, and the thing that must be understood
here is that this case is not a pollution case.

It has

•

it's being brought here with that attractiveness in the times
of today, but the fact is that it is not a pollution case
because if we are complying with State and Federal standards
concerning what went into the river, we could put the same
thing into the fionongahela River today, and I offered to prove
that, that we did in 1970, because they are within the
standards of the Government of the United States,
The reply brief of the government, again this

42
represents what I offered to prove.

It says that I offered to

prove that we would comply with the 1374 standards. That is
not the offer of proof.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed Clean
Streams Legislation before the Federal Government found out
that there was a problem.

Our Act was passed in 1937? the

Federal Act in 1948.
I offered to prove that under the present
Pennsylvania standards, which are among the highest in the
country, they intelligently to deal with the economy and the
ecology and the technology that is available said by December
31st, 1974, these will be the new standards that will be
applicable to effluent discharges in streams of this
Commonwealth.
I offered to prove that PICCO is already in the
process, and was when the canoes floated up and down the
river, ready, in the process of building a $300,000 additional
water treatment plant to meet the new standards which were
effected and will be effective December 31st, 1974,

You do

not have, as the government untruthfully tells this Court
in its reply brief, the largest polluter of the Monongahela
River,

You have a company that has accepted its

responsibilities, understands its responsibilities, and the
only thing the government has done in this prosecution has
attempted to turn off an industry that recognizes that it is

43
trying to be a good citizen of this country and comply with
the Water Control Programs of the Federal and State governments.
QUESTION?

Mr. Gondelman, the Court of Appeals

relied heavily on its conclusion that even if an application
for a permit had been made# no permit could have been obtained
because the court's opinion says permits were unavailable*
In your view, is the record clear on that, or is
that disputed in the record?
MR. GONDELMAN;

It was disputed in the record.

It

was disputed, but I tried to prove it in two ways; First of
all, Exhibit G, which I offered in evidence and attempted to
argue to the jury, shows the schedule of permits, the dollar
cost of all permits. There is nothing in Exhibit G that would
indicate that this permit would have been required, or that
there was a charge for it, or included in Exhibit G.
The other is the — twofold:

first, that Mr.

Ruckelshaus, and I have that as part of my brief, actually
in an interview had said — I think it's on page 7a of my
brief, Your Honor; and I'm prepared to prove this.

Mr.

Ruckelshaus, who theoretically should know something about
the Act of 1899, since today he is the one in charge of the
administration of the program, was asked if there was an over­
lapping of the statutes.

In the second paragraph, he savss

"It really isn’t entirely fair to say that the
reason a person is being sued under the Refuse Act is because

44
they don't have a permit, they couldn't get one if they wanted
to.
"Until the permit program of the Corps of Engineers
was announced late last year, after the Presidential
Proclamation, we didn't have any permit program for the
discharge of waste into a stream." So that under

his own

admission, under the exhibits which I did offer, and I would
be pleased to leave these -- these were maintained by me, I
didn't realise the Court of Appeals had sent them up
QUESTION;

Mr. Gondelman, let’s assume you were

dumping solid metal of some kind, which unquestionably was a
pollutant in the river.

Let's just assume that you had been.

Would you say that there was any doubt under the Refuse Act
that you could be prosecuted?
MR, GONDELMAN*

No, sir, because if I were dumping

a solid into the river, then we are under the Republic Steel
case, and the history of Republic Steel since 1904 •—
QUESTION;

It wouldn't make any difference whether

you had a permit or not, or whether you applied for a permit
or not, or whether there was a permit program or not, would it?
MR, GONDELMANs

Well, it would in this sense, Your

Honor, —
QUESTION;

Well, I'll just ask you again, you are

dumping solids in a river, let's assume there was no permit
program up until that — at the time that you dumped the solids

45
in the river.

How, could you be prosecuted under this law or

not?
MR. GONDELMAN:

If there was no permit program

whatsoever?
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GONDELMAN;

I don't think we could be prosecuted

under this law.
QUESTION;

So you're saying that we must then

construe this law as meaning that unless there's a permit
program, you may not be prosecuted even if you were dumping
admittedly polluting material in the stream?
MR. GONDELMAN: Right*

And then we would not have

this case. That's why I said originally
QUESTION; What do you mean you wouldn't have this
case?
MR. GONDELMAN: Well, because this case and Your
Honor's case are two different cases.

And the facts of my

case —
QUESTIONs

Well, they aren't two different cases

if you think, for example, that the question of whether this
was refuse is foreclosed.
MR. GONDELMAN:

No, you don't have this case

because, Your Honor, since 1899 everybody in this country
knew that the Act of 1899 affected the discharge of solids
into a stream. The Republic Steel case only made new law,

because it took a civil procedure and permitted an injunction,,
QUESTIONs But again, your argument turns on whether
or not a permit program is essential to permit prosecution
under the Refuse Act.
HR. GONDELMAN:
QUESTIONs

Hot completely.

My argument *—

But rather substantially, I would think.

MR. GONDELMANs

My argument is

QUESTION: Well, let's assume for the moment, then,
that you say a permit program is not essential to permit
prosecution under the Act, and that you may be prosecuted
even if there was no way of getting a permit.
MR. GONDELMAN;

What I'm saying, Your Honor, and the

reason I can't fit a factual situation into your hypothetical
factual situation is simply this:

It doesn't stop with the

narrow factual situation you're presenting to me, I respectfully suggest.

What I'm saying to you is this:

change your

factual situation just a little bit for me, and say that
solids are being dumped into the river and for seventy years
the Corps of Engineers says you don't need a permit to dump
those solids in the river, and then have a criminal prosecution,
and then I say of course, the government cannot lead an
industry into an entrapment —*
QUESTION:

So you're really saying, then, that it's

not just the existence of a permit program, —
MR. GONDELMAN: That's right.

47
QUESTION:

-- it's an affirmative representation

that you don't need a permit or anything else for this»
MR. GONDELMANs
QUESTION:

That’s right.

It’s just as though you had a permit.

MR. GONDELMANs

It's an affirmative — the Court of

Appeals said we were misled, and that is a very basic finding»
QUESTION: Well, you're saying — in effect you're
saying you had a permit.
MR. GONDELMAN:

And in effect I'm saying we had a

permit because the State —•
QUESTION:

And to be prosecuted when you had a

permit is a denial of due process; that's really your case.
MR. GONDELMAN:

Basically that is the second part of

my case, that is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, is that any different from the first?
MR. GONDELMAN:

It is in part because in the first

situation we're saying that without any permit program
whatsoever —
QUESTION:

Yes, but that doesn't seam to hold water,

does it, if you are dumping real solids in the river?
MR. GONDELMAN: Well, it would hold real solid, you
see, but not real water.

I mean, we have to talk about water

in the «*“
QUESTION:

Well, if you were dumping real solids

in the river, it wouldn't make any difference whether there

43

was a permit program or not.
MR. GONDELMAN; Right.

Unless the government

affirmatively misled industry into believing they could do so.
QUESTIONS Well, that’s your second argumento
MR. GONDELMANt

Fine.

I'd stand on that argument as

well.
Thank you, Your Honor, I’m sorry I ran over,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Reynolds, do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REYNOLDS:

Just one or two points, Mr, Chief

Justice.
I think that with respect —
QUESTION;

You don’t refer in your brief to the old

well-established federal lav/ of public nuisance in polluting
the stream.

Was that considered below or argued below?

MR. REYNOLDS;

No, Your Honor, that -— this case

was exclusively under the statute, and the public nuisance
federal law was not involved in this particular case»
QUESTION; Conceivably you might have been able to
get an injunction under the law of nuisance that Mr. Justice
Douglas was suggesting?
MR. REYNOLDS; Conceivably I think that’s right.
QUESTION;

But that couldn't be criminal prosecutions

HR. REYNOLDSi

Illinois and the City of Milwaukee,

I believe this Court indicated that under the — there is a
federal lav; of nuisance which conceivably would be available.
But this was an action brought under the federal statute,
and that was not involved.
I just want to raake the point that the Corps of
Engineers, after 1968, after this Court decided the Standard
Oil case and made it clear that the Refuse Act applied to
non-navigation impeding discharges, that at that time it changed
its attitude with respect to its responsibilities? it9s this
1968 regulation which Mr. Gondelman showed to the Court was
withdrawn, it instituted new regulations which put — whereby
everyone was put on notice of the fact that the Corps was now
considering pollution matters, conservation matters with
respect to applications for permission to use the navigable
waters,

And this was made crystal clear with respect to the

Refuse Act itself in the notice that we have appended to the
reply brief, in July of 1970, where it made — it was clear
that there was a permit available at the time of these
offenses, and even if the most superficial inquiry had been
made by the company of the Corps, assuming that they had some
doubt as to whether the law did in fact apply to this
particular discharge, if they made the most superficial
inquiry, they would have been notified at that time that
there was in fact a permit available, and one that they should

50•
have gotten before making these discharges.
I would point out, just in closing, that in fact in
November of 1970, which is after the time of these offenses,
Mr. Justice Blackmun, the dates you were talking about earlier,
but in November of 1970 the Corps explicitly advised this
company that their discharges from this plant into the
Monongahela River was in violation of the Refuse Act without
a permit, and they would need a permit.
So that the permit, the permits were available and
had they made any kind of inquiry they could have gotten
these permits.

They didn't, and in the absence of doing so,

we think that it was proper — that the conviction was proper
under the Refuse Act,
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
The case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
You may leave them if you

wish with the Clerk,
MR. GONDELMANi

All right, sir.

[Whereupon, at 1j20 o'clock, p.m,, the case was
submitted.]
