MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will hear

arguments first this morning in two consolidated cases *

71-685, Lehnhfi'u&eri against:.Lake Shore Auto Parts, and 71-691,
Barrett against Shapiro.
Mr. Scott, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGHMEttP OF WILLIAM J. SCOTT, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT (71-685)
MR, SCOTT:

Mrt Chief Justice, and may it please

tiie Court:
The cases before the Court this morning involve the
legitimate and reasonable attempt of the representatives of
the people of the State of Illinois to bring an archaic and
unworkable tax structure into accordance with the problems of
our modern-day society, and to bring a taxing system that was
based, from the time when Illinois was an agricultural State
over 100 years ago, into line with the concepts of today
when we are one of the largest industrial States in the nation*
The tax under consideration was the personal property
tax which was unworkable, unjust and unfair to the people of
our State*

In its administration, it varied 'completely

throughout the Stats.

*

. r

^

The bulk of the funds came from the assessments on
corporations that were easy to ascertain and easy to enforce
due to the fact that we could dissolve a corporation if they

4
failed fco file their papers and pay the tax*
The tax on individuals was administered variously
throughout the 102 different counties.
One example of the discrepancy was that the downState agricultural community, the individuals paid $27 million
in 1970, and in the industrial areas of Chicago, it was less
than $2 million.
It was virtually impossible to ascertain the in­
tangibles, and in some of the means of assessing they took
into consideration that to tax it at the full rate would be
almost a confiscation of the property.
For that reason, the Legislature elected officials
and members of the delegation to the new Constitutional
Convention all strive to develop an orderly way of phasing out
this tax.
Along with that proposition, the Legislatures of
the State in 1969 also voted to impose a State income tax on
the State for the first time.
That income tax was held constitutional by Che
Supreme Court of Illinois, despite the fact that there was a
difference in classification in the tax rate for corporations
and individuals.
During that same year, the Legislature, by a joint
resolution of the Senate and the House, overwhelmingly placed
a referendum before the people of the State, stating that the

5
new article to be adopted by the people would eliminate an
ad valorem tax on individuals.
That resolution was adopted overwhelmingly,, (Same**
where between seven and eight out of every person in the State
voted for it.
The new Constitution took this into consideration
with an orderly phase-out of the personal property tax.

And

they provided that for any tax that was eliminated before
January 1, 1971, that there could be no new tax placed on to
substitute for it, realising that this had been the main
purpose of our State income tax and that the budgets of the
local school districts and local governments had been
determined accordingly.
However, with the desire to completely phase out
the personal property tax by 1979, the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention provided that any taxes that were
eliminated on personal property after January 1, 1971 **** in
other words, the day after this constitutional amendment to
the 1870 Constitution were to become effective — would have to
be replaced by a substitute source of revenue on that same
source,
So we are talking about a question of whether or
not there is any meaningful tax relief for the individual
citizens of Illinois, as was designated by the Legislature,
by their elected officials, by their delegates to the

6

Constitutional Convention, in line with the will of the
people of this State.
In the case at hand, the Lake Shore Auto Parts
Corporation

attacked the constitutionality of the revenue

article providing for the personal property tax, saying that
by virtue of the amendment to the 1.870 Constitution ire
revenue article became unconstitutional, claiming that it
violated the Federal Constitution under equal protection of
law.
Faced with that possibility, that the revenue
article would be unconstitutional and that over $300 million
worth of finances every year would be lost to the school
district, resulting in complete chaos in our local government,
the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled that the revenue article
was not unconstitutional because of the amendment but went on
to rule that the amendment to the Constitution was uncon­
stitutional under the Federal Constitution.
In doing so, they reacted with the consideration of
the existing fact that a new constitution had been adopted by
delegates representing the people of the State, and had been
adopted by the people of the State, and that that constitution
specifically recognised the facts involved in the Article 9
amendment to the previous constitution and provided for a
complete phasing out of the personal property tax.
And that new constitution also placed on the State,

7
for the first: time in history,the responsibility for the
primary funding of education in this State, that it was a
attempt to modernise our whole taxing structure and to deal
with the responsibilities of government.
And that under this reasonable scheme it was
designed to remove the tax first from the people that had lee;:
treated most unjustly, and then to systematically remove the
tax completely.
And that the responsibility of financing the
schools and local governments would be met by other forms,
such as our new State income tax, and based on the constitu­
tional obligation that the primary responsibility for
education in the State now be carae a State function.
Q

X gather as to ad valorem taxes against corporations,

is there a phasing-out time table?
MR* SCOTT:
Q

Yes, sir.

Is that in a provision of the existing constitution

or something that's being -MR. SCOTT:

Yes,

What had happened was that in

1970 the State convened a Constitutional Convention, and for
the first time in 100 years revised our Constitution completely.
In that Constitution, the delegates specifically
took notice of this problem that we had in personal property
tax and provided for a phasing-out completely of the personal
property tax by 1979.

8
Q

That’s actually written?
MR. SCOTT:

It is actually written into the new

Constitution.
Q

And automatically will become effective unless the

Constitution were again amended?
MR. SCOTT:

It will automatically become effective

and the provision realising that a great deal of the financial
support of our school system was based on the personal
property tax,and by far the bulk of it based on the personal
property tax on corporations —
Q

And did you say earlier, if I might interrupt,

$300 million raised by the property tax against corporations
alone?
MR. SCOTT:

The total tax now is somewhere in

the nature of $350 million —
Q

Raised by taxes only against corporations.
MR. SCOTT:

Only by personal property.

Of that amount, somewhere between $50 and $75 million
of it, comes from individuals, and approsiimately $300 million
of it comes from the corporations.
Back in 1970, we. c were talking about $300 million
for the total package.
Q

But now the first step was to eliminate property tax

as against the individual?
MR. SCOTT:

Against individuals, which was done by

9
an amendment to the old constitution at the time that the
State income tax went into effect.
Q

Now then, when was the next step?
MR. SCOTT:

The next step was a convening of a

new Constitutional Conventions which provided that any other
taxes that hadn't gone into effect as of the effective date of
that amendment, January 1, 1971, that any other taxes would be
phased out no later than 1979.
Q

Any other could mean only taxes against corporation:::.,

property tax against corporations, could it?
MR. SCOTT:

That was our contention.

Any other, as against individuals, is what they
specified, and, of course, the Supreme Court of Illinois in
this case had indicated that the distinction between in­
dividuals and corporations, which is one of the points under
consideration —
Q

I am still puzzled, Mr, Attorney General.

don't understand.

I still

Do you have anywhere a reference to the

actual language of the Constitutional Convention?
MR. SCOTT:
Q

Yes, we do.

He have it in our brief.

Could you give me just the page.
Is it at page 4 of your brief in that footnote?
MR* SCOTT:

Page 4 in the footnote,

that on or

before January 1, 1979, the General Assembly shall abolish
ail Q<* valorem personal property tax, and concurrently therewith

10
and thereafter shall replace all revenue loss by units of
local government and school districts as a result of the
abolition of the ad valorem personal property tax, subsequent
to January 2, 1971, taking into cognisance the fact that on
January 1, 1971, under the Article 9, Section

A

amendment to

the old Constitution, that the tax on individuals would ha e
been eliminated,
Q

But this is not self-operative.

It requires

a lav

of the General Assembly abolishing, doeenft it?
MR* SCOTT:

It would require that the Legislature

orderly phase it out and replace it -**
Q

Suppose the Legislature didn't do what this requires

them to do?
MR. SCOTT:

Well, then we would ha\?e complete chaos

and we would have lost the -Q

I am familiar in my own State with constitutional

provisions which have directed the Legislature to do save thing
back in 1947 and they haven't done it yet,
MR* SCOTT:

Well, it would have left us in a

situation that we would be in today if the argument of the
Lake Shore Auto Parts Corporation is upheld, that we would
*

«

have no source of revenue for financing the State.
The practical number,
taxes of '70,
$1 billion

t

here, for example, for the

‘71'72, that are under consideration, is
and so that it is the financing of the

11

school districts of our State.
-

■ •

Q

Has the General Assembly, as yet, Introduced any

legislation similar to Subsection (c)?
HR* SCOTT:

The most important factor that happened,

and I think should be recognised by this Court and was not
involved in the majority decision of the Supreme Court, is
that the State, for the first time in history, did pass an
income tax to give us a source of revenue, and that that has
gone into effect, and that there is a distinction there, a
4% rate on corporations and a 2\% rate on individuals.
And what this provision in the Constitution is
saying is that when you do take off the tax as to corporations
that there has to be 30220 type of compensating Statewide
tax*
Q

Are you suggesting that the new income tax,

quote,is that compensating tax?
MR* SCOTT:

It is the vehicle that now exists for

the first time.
For 100 years, it was held that we could not have
an income tax.
We presented the case in 1969 to the Supreme Court
and due to the fact that the economics and structure of the
State had changed they reversed themselves and ruled that it
was constitutional to have an income tax in Illinois and also

12

that: it was constitutional to make the differential in the
classifications between corporations and individuals, which
is the basis that the delegates to the Constitutional Con­
vention were operating on* and that the whole program was an
orderly and designed one to change our method of financing to
a more equitable and realistic one for the State.
Q

As I understood one of the arguments that you have

alluded to,but stressed inyaur brief, is that in terms of
trying to collect this tax from individuals it was. totally
uneconomic because the cost was more than the reward and that
only -- was it 2% -« of the total tax came from individuals
and 98% — about — from corporations?
MS.* SCOTT:

Hell, it varied throughout the State.

The farmer, of course., was faced with the problem
that his tractor was sitting there in the field.

It was

enforceable. The assessor could see it.
The vast bulk of the holdings in the State, of course,
as far as individuals, would be common stocks and battle
accounts that could be shifted out of the State.
And so that the problem that the enforcing officers
had was that to go in on an assessment of an individual on
hie automobile, for example, would cost us more in court
cases to collect than the tax was worth*
Q

You haven't addressed yourself to the power of the

State to have one tax on corporations which is not applicable

13
to anybody else,,

at least, you haven't directly for me.

MR. SCOTT:

Well, aa X mentioned

in. there, our

income tax case, our own Supreme Court took cognisance of
a number of cases that had existed in the U,S, Supreme €•:

rt

that said that it is possible to classify as to ownership,
that it is possible to do that in

a

property tax case such

as in the Allied Stores case of Ohio, which came after
Quaker City Cab case, which was in 1959, one of the moat
recent cases which permitted classification of property tax
proposed on the basis of the identity of the owner.
At the time that the Illinois Supreme Court upheld
the distinction between the corporations and individuals in
income tax,they referred to other cases, such as Lawrence v.
Mississippi, where Justice Stone, who was one of the dis­
tinguished dissenting judges in the Quaker City Cab case,
along with Justice Srandeis and Justice Holmes.
Justice Stone said States have unrestricted power
to tax those domiciled within them, so long as that tax is
imposed upon property within the State or privileges enjoyed
there and it is not arbitrary or unreasonable.
In this case, it was the State income tax relieving
domestic corporations,but not ones from outside the State,on
income from activities carried on outside of the State.
And this was held not to violate the Equal Protection
Clause.

14
There have been many cases that permit the State to
single out property of corporations and subject it to taxation,
to the exclusion of all others»
And I submit to the Court that the Illinois Con­
stitution, the Illinois Statutes, the Illinois law, the Federal
Constitution, the Federal law, does permit our State to eir <lc
out property of & corporation and to subject it to taxation
to the exclusion of all others, that in doing so that the
Legislature reflected the will of the people of the. State.
And I respectfully ask that the Court take this
into consideration and reverse the judgment of the, Supreme
Court of Illinois.
Q

Mr. Scott, let me ask a question about the con­

stitutional provision that Justice Brennan inquired about
which is on the footnote on page 4 of your brief.
Supposing that the Legislature of Illinois does
nothing more than it has already done between now and 1979,
and this constitutional provision remains as it is,
Would the ad valorem tax be automatically un­
constitutional as of 1979, even though the Legislature does
nothing more about it?
HR. SCOTT:

That's right.

And so that the incentive,

of course, on the Legislature is that we would have no way
of replacing this tremendous volume of revenue for our school
districts.

15
So it Is inconceivable that having gone through the
anguish of placing the income tax on the State,that the
Legislature would do nothing to finance the schools.
Certainly, the whole attempt here is to have a
responsible and reasonable approach to this tremendous problem
of financing local government, and specifically the schools,
of our State.
Q

Your answer to Justice Rehnquist is that auto­

matically, even if your Legislature does nothing under Section
C, on January 1, 1979, the ad. valorem personal property tax,
even as against corporations, is abolished?
MR, SCOTT:

It would violate the Illinois

Constitution,
Q

No, no.

But if your Legislature does nothing,

as this requires it to do, nevertheless, are you saying that
the -MR, SCOTT:
Q

That*a my interpretation.

Mr. Scott, do you know whether other States draw

that same distinction between corporations and individuals
and whether their doing so has been upheld against constitutional attack?
MR. SCOTT:

Well, I think one of the important

factors of this case is that all of the States, like Illinois,
are going through this transition.

Forty-eight of the 50

States do have some type of a personal property tax.

Ours,

/

16
of course -~
<Q

Might 1 suggest that Illinois is way at the end of

the line la getting to this point?
MEL SCOTT:

We had a very real problem in ever

amending our constitution.

It took us 100 years to get it

done.
Q

That's why I raade my statement.

I think you are

way behind the times.
But coming to my question, do you know of any other
State which draws this same distinction between corporations
and individuals, which distinction has been upheld against
constitutional attack?
ME* SCOTT: Wo, I don't.
Q

Generally speaking, the --

I suggest that: there are come.

It might well be

worth investigating.
MR. SCOTT:

Thank you.

The chief of our Appellate Division died of a heart
attack.

He had been the person that had been handling this

case, and without the benefit of his consultation it may well
be that we have overlooked those.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUBREY F. KAPLAN, ESQ.,

m

BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS <71-691)

I®, KAPLAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it 3lease

the Court:
The issue in this case, as tie see it, is whether or
not a State*s highest court can disregard the constitution of
that State and its own prior decisions in determining whether
or not a classification for tax purposes is valid.
Q

That would be a Federal question, wouldn't it?
MR. KAPLAN:

I believe that the determination of the

validity of a classification as whether or not it is offen­
sive to the Fourteenth Amendment would be,
Q

Yes, but not as respect what the State consti­

tution means it requires.
MR. KAPLAN:

I believe that whether a State court

determines, resolves, a case in accordance with its own law or
completely disregards its own law, its own case law, and its
own constitution in deciding a case, is a Federal question.
It seems to me that litigants who present pleadings,
arguments, all the way through the case -» may I call Your
Honors' attention to the Appendix, and I think it*s page 1,
where in Relevant Docket Entries there is only one relevant
docket entry which antedates the approval by the electorate
in Illinois of the 1970 constitution, you see.
And throughout the litigation, the State's Attorney

16
of Cook County and the Attorney General, as well, have relied
on “■»
Q

I notice that under your trial court; in this case,

it i3 invalidated both under the State and under the Federal
Constitution»

But Justice Schaefer, as I read his opi ion,

relied only on the Fourteenth Amendment,
Ml, KAPLAN:

Justice Schaefer --

No, Your Honor, Justice Schaefer relied on the
superseded Illinois Constitution of 1870 to invalidate 9(a),

Q

Then we don't have a Federal question?
MR, KAPLAN;

Well, I think the Federal question is

must -* are litigants deprived of a fair trial and due process
of law when a State court refuses to observe its own case
law and its own constitution, which was in effect at the time
of the decision?

You see, the 1970 Constitution came into effect on
July the 1st, 1971,
The opinion handed down by Justice Schaefer appeared
about 10 days later.
Now the case law in Illinois — as a matter of
fact, with opinions written by Justice Schaefer -- say that
the Illinois reviewing courts must decide cases in terms of
the law as it exists at the time of the decision and not at
-

•

some prior time.

Not only that. Justice Schaefer> in an opinion

19
written shortly before this, in the Hager case , which appears
® c*

Q

At page A-15 of the Petition for Urit of Certiorari

--I think it must be about the last page of Justice SchaeferTe
majority opinion -- he says, ”We hold, therefore, that the
discrmination produced by Article 9(a) violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,

Apart from

that discrimination, the validity of the Revenue Act does
not challenge,”
Mow that sounds to me like a holding under the
Federal
Constitution.
i
HR. KAPLAN:
Q

Yes.

It’s not a ruling on the Due Process question that

you now present.
HR, KAPLAN:

Well, we are raising it because

Justice Schaefer limited his examination of the governing
law to Illinois 1870 Constitution,

■* ,

The Illinois 1870 said that you could not -- that
personal property tax must be uniform and it must be applied
to everyone.
The 1970 Constitution

provider specifically for

classification and if provides that the classes may be
relieved of the tax in series -- page 7 of our brief,
personal property tax, which is Section 5 of the Illinois
Constitution of 1970,

20
It says that Che General Assembly may classify
personal property for purposes of taxation by valuation^
abolish such taxes on any or all classes, and authorize the
levy of taxes in lieu of the taxation of personal property by
valuation.
In other words, under the 1970 Constitution, you
can make any kind of a reasonable classification that doesn't
offend the Fourteenth Amendment and it will bq all, right.
And it also says that if you make nine classifica**
tions, you can take it off in Classification One this year,
Classification Two the next year, and as long as that is not
offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment, that is, if the
classes are drawn properly, that will be valid.
Now, this was impossible under the 1870 Constitution.
Now, I think that it is clear that the 1970
Constitution of Illinois was in effect at the time of the
decision.
The cases which stand for the proposition that the
reviewing court must use the 1970 Constitution in determining
this case are also in the brief, and I don't think that they
require any elaboration.
So, it is simply a question of which Illinois
Constitution governs.

And by using the wrong one -- it is

wrong in terms of the precedent of that Court ~~

t

think that

the people of the State of Illinois have been denied a fair

21
trial.

Particularly, since all pleadings, all briefs, every

presentation to each and every court, both the Illinois
Supreme Court and those before it, were predicated on the
assumption that the 1970 Constitution was in effect and, in
addition, we have cases from the Illinois Supreme Court
which anticipate the effective date of a constitutional
provision»
In the Hamer case -•* and, again, this is an opinion
from Mr. Justice Schaefer — the case was disposed of after
9(a) had been adopted by the people, but before its effective
date.
And, in that case, the rule was invoked suq sponti
by the court.
That was in December 1970,
We have every reason to expect that the 1971
Constitution would be the controlling law in deciding this
case — should be.
We anticipated that.

We relied on it,

And, gentlemen, the rules were changed after the
game was played, and this is what we object to,
Q

You say, after the amendment was either adopted or

it was so far along that it couldn't be altered?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, the 1970 Constitution had been

adopted by the people.
Q

And when was the opinion that you spoke of?

22
1®.« KAPLAN:

Let: me give Your Honor the chronology.

The 9(a) was approved by the people of Illinois on
November 3, 1970,

It was to go into effect on January 1,

1971,
The new Constitution of Illinois was approved by
the electorate December 15, 1970, and was to go Into effect
July 1, 1971.
Now, the only event reflected in the opinions «*»
relevant docket entries — that antedates the day when the
1970 Constitution was approved by the people of Illinois,
was the filing

of the first complaint in the Lake Shore case,

and every subsequent filing came in after December 15, 1970,
Based on the precedent set by that court, the court
should have —* if it was going to follow its own rules and
its own declarations — decided this case in terns of the
1970 Constitution.
And the 1970 Constitution specifically permits
classification and for removal of the personal property tax
from some classes and not other*

It compels replacement of

that tax in 1979, and the imposition of a tax to replace the
revenues lost.
And this is another very important point, because
I think Your Honors must appreciate that this decision
emasculates the revenue article of the 1970 Constitution and
totally perverts the intent of the people and their expectation.

23
To paraphrase what was to happen -- and Chore has
been some dispute about what is the definition1 of the Cera.
"individuals-*'
The Attorney General has emphasised the approach
that says Individuals are everybody except corporatieas.
The State's Attorney has emphasised an approach
which says individuals are

means only the non-business

property of natural persons.
Now, our approach is based on custom and usage
in the nomenclature of property tax administration in Illinois.
For example, the law requires everyone in Illinois to file a
schedule with his assessor.
of schedules.

There are basically three classes

One of them is titled individuals.

The other

Is businesses and the third is corporations.
Every lawyer in Illinois who deals in tax matters,
if asked what "individuals" means, he says that is the non­
business property of natural persons, because that's all that's
left if you separate unincorporated businesses and corporations
from the entire pie of those subject to the personal property
tax.
All right, now — that's the kind of a definition
argument that we were fighting about before,and our position
is that by either definition it is valid.
i

Now, what was intended is this,

Individuals were

to be excused free» the tax on January 1, 1970.

I beg your

24
pardon, 1971.
January 2, 1971, to January 1, 1979, the tax

was

to remain on non-individuals.
Now, on January 1, 1979, or before, that: tax was
to be replaced by another tax, or the revenue was to be
replaced by another tax -- I beg your pardon
tax, if it was to be an income tax

and that

would be an exception

to the 8 to 5 differential provided in the income tax
provisions of the Illinois 1970 Constitution.
What happens --so the result of that would
actually be to preserve the status quo with respect to who
pays the personal property tax in Illinois, because, as
everyone concedes, corporations or businesses pay about
over 90% of it,
Q

Do you agree with your colleague that the

the Attorney General — that this is an automatic phase-out,
whether the Legislature acts or does not act before 1979?
MR. KAPLAN:

Your Honor, I confess I do not have the

answer to that question, but I would anticipate that we may
be here in 1971 —
Q

*79, you mean.
MR, KAPLAN:

I beg your pardon*

is about the timing.
Q

On the *79 problem.

that if the Legislature refuses to act, every effort will

be made to compel them to do so.

How that will come about,

I don’t know.
But the point that I am trying to make is this,
that if you invalidate the exoneration of individuals, then
everyone is subject to that tax after January 1, 19719 and,
therefore, everyone is subject to the replacement tax.

And,

if the replacement tax is an exception to the 8 to 5 ratio,
then it would be uniforta.
And the effect of this is to shift the burden of
the personal property tax from businesses and corporations
back to the wage earner»
This is what happens under Justice Schaefer’s

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD M. FLAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FLAM:

(71-685)

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it plea: e

the Court:
At the risk of running out of tierce on my prepared
argtaaent, I would like to begin by addressing myself to a
few of the questions that have come from the bench.
I am well aware that it is not the function or
the obligation of this Court to construe Section 5(c) of the
new Illinois Constitution with regard to the supposed
ultimate abolition of personal property taxation in Illinois
I must strongly disagree with the Attorney General
opinion.

I think that it is not self“executing, and further

more, as we have suggested in our brief and refer to a very
important article on the subject, it could not be executed
by the Legislature even if it wanted to.
So that I think personal property taxation in
Illinois9on whatever categories it is permissible, is going
to be with us until the constitution is again amended.
Some reference was made to the relative difficulty
of collecting the tax from individuals as compared to
collecting it from corporations.
Apparently, some 90-some percent is collected from
corporations, but that, I can assure the Court, has nothing
to do with any administrative ease.

It has to do with one

27

-

fact only and that fact is that individuals vote at elections
and they vote for or against tax collectors, whereas, corporationsddo not have the. privilege- of voting.
.Q

' ■:

As a practical matter, isn’t there something to that
.< ..

argument that it is much easier because corporations, for the
most part, have got to keep inventories, they’ve got Federal
tax records which are open to the examination of local —
MR. FLAMM:

Well, it is quite true, Your Honor, that

as a general rule, I mentioned this in our brief, that
corporate property tends to be more visible and is therefore
more easily assessed.
But certainly, automobiles, for example, of
individuals, there is not the slightest problem with assessing
that, and yet, as is pointed out by the Legislature in its
argument, in die city of Chicago,no attempt at all is made to
assess automobiles at any figure.
X am suggesting that to some extent there is a
visibility factor which differentially discriminates against
corporations, but essentially the problem is not an adminis­
trative problem.

It is a problem of the will to collect

taxes.
And in terms of the arbitrariness of the whole
taxing system, it is far more arbitrary with re,sp.ect to
corporations than it is with respect to individuals.
Individuals, no matter where they live

--

Q

But, Mr. Flam, if that difference which the

Attorney General referred to between down-state and Chicago
is correct, I would suggest that it is very largely a matter
of visibility rather than corporate versus individual.
MR* FLAMM;

Certainly, down-state where there are

farm property which is relatively visible, they do get a
significant proportion of their revenue from farmers.
The biggest proportion throughout tine State comes
from public utilities which, of course, are, as Chief
Justice mentions «- 'obviously, file personal property .schedules
and they can’t hide their property.
But in terns quite apart from who pays most, in
terns of the intraclass differentials, which is the most
arbitrary assessment, among corporations it is far greater
than among individuals, because individuals, no matter where
they live,pay a relatively small tax which bears no relation
to any property they own but, as a politically adjusted or
determined matter, maybe it is a percentage of their real
estate tax bill or a percentage of their -- depending on the
.

kind of car they have — but it,at least, is a small amount.
I don’t mean to make too much of an issue over
this.

I don’t think it is directly relevant.
As to Justice Blackmun’s inquiry, 1 am confident,

I know for a fact there is no other State which has anything
comparable, or even purports to discriminate against corporations

29
for purposes of property taxation.
In terms of alternative revenue sources, the
argument has been made that Article 9(a) was a means of
relieving the wage earner, or creating a more equitable
tax system, well, perhaps so, but certainly there are
alternatives.
In fact, since the decision of this case by the
State Court, the Legislature has adopted an alternative,
a flat $5,000 exemption from personal property taxes for
corporations and individuals which,no doubt, will have
substantially the same effect of this proposed amendment
without creating any Federal constitutional problem.
It may create some serious State problems, but no
Federal problem, I think,
q

Do you see any parallel to this situation and the

statutes in quite a number of States that exempt the first
five or ten or fifteen thousand dollars of value of owneroccupied property?
MR. FLAMM:

Well, the fact that it is the first

X number of dollars, I don*t see any problem with.
I think,certainly,the Fourteenth Amendment does
not prohibit
Q

—

It certainly discriminates against the apartment

owner, apartment building owners, does ifi not?
MR* FLAMM:

Well, I think another example might be

30

that many Statas have exemptions for persons over 65 years
of age, and I certainly would concede that there is some
parallel there, but I think the difference is that the
exemption for homeowners, or for aged homeowners, can be
justified on the basis, in the case of the aged ones, that
they have no longer a source of income.

But it is not simply

based on ownership, as such, but is based on the fact that
older people presumably no longer have a regular source of
income yet their tax bills keep going up year after year, and
m

m

Q

Go back to the homestead exemption..

There is a

direct discrimination between corporate owners of big
apartment buildings as against the individual who owns and
lives in his own house,
MR* FLAM:

Well, if there is a discrimination •»-

you say discrimination against corporate owners of apartment
buildings, but they would be, as X understand it, in the same
category as an individual owner of an apartment building*
The disermination certainly is against apartment
buildings as compared to single family homes.
#

We see no constitutional problem with that.

That

is based on the kind of property, rather than the nature of
the ownership.
Q

Also there is a difference of treatment between

people who rent houses, who own houses for rental, and those

31
who own houses to live in.
MR, FLAM:

Well, I think that’s a valid -- that is

based on the nature or use of the property and even in the —
back in the Califcrenia. Railed ta^ cases, 90 years ago,
Justice Field specifically recognised that a classification
based on the nature or use of the property is a valid one.
It is only the classification based on the nature
of the ownership, at least particularly corporate ownership
as against noncorporate ownership, that was the or.^cnc
violation in his view.
If i may return to my prepared text —
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We will enlarge your

time to three minutes to compensate,and will enlarge you:.'
colleague*s time two minutes.
MR, FLAM:

Well, 1 must say that I appreciate the

Court's term, but I am not a colleague of the M. Weil Company,
because we are opposed on a very important issue over here,
Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I am using the term in

a broad sense,
MR. FLAMM:

Thank you.

In some ways, I suppose, this is a rather olefa shloned sort of a lawsuit.
On its central issue, the facts are essentially
identical to those which were before this Court 90 years ago

32
in Santa Clara County y, Southern Pacific,
The Santa Clara case, of course, served fco establish
fche fundamental principle that corporations are persons within
the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in a very real
sense, I suggest, it is that doctrine which is under challenge
today as a consequence of the ill-conceived constitutional
amendment proposed by the Illinois Legislature,
I represent Lake Shore Auto Parts Company., as you
know, personal property taxpayer in Cook County,
How we initiated this litigation in the Circuit
Court of Cook County and Lake Shore did so, I will freely
admit, not because of any desire fco vindicate the abstract
rights of corporations, and even less from any desire to
pay homage to the memory of Justice Field, who promulgated
the original doctrine here. Dux intention, obviously»was
to free ourselves from the yolk of a burdensome tax, a tax
which is not merely burdensome but which is, at least in
Illinois, arbitrary, scandalous and a source of disrespect
for the courts and for the judicial process,
I need not labor that point because the Attorney
General himself agrees fully with us on that score.

If there

is any doubt, beyond that, it is removed, I think, by the
.

official explanation of the amendment prepared by the Illinois
General Assembly,
That document, which is appended as Exhibit A to

33

our brief, is a complete and all-inclusive statement of the
intention of the Legislature.

It leaves no room for surmise

as to what might have been intended*
The interesting thing, 1 think, about that official
explanation is that every evil of the personal property tax
set forth therein is fully as applicable to corporations as
it is to individuals.
One may re-read that time after time, I think, and
find no clue in there as to why the General Assembly eliminate.
the tax only on individuals*
The principles,/set forth in the Santa Clara case,
or originally announced there, and adopted more firmly in
the Quaker City Gab case in 1925, has gone unchallenged in
this Court for almost 40 years.
It has been accepted as a matter of doctrine that
States may not diserminate for property tax purposes as
against corporate ownership, as such.
On one occasion, admittedly in 1920, this Court
departed from that rule in the Fort Smith Lumber Company
case — that’s a very brief opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes,
who upheld the discriminatory statute on the ground that the
Arkansas Legislature might conceivable have been acting in
furtherance of a permissible State policy, namely, a policy
of discouraging ownership of corporate stock by corporations.
It has generally

been accepted, I think, that that

34

case has been overruled effectively by Quaker City Cab.
At any rate, Fort Smith has been hardly lever cited
by anyone in the 60 years, 40 years, 50 years, since it was
decided.

It lias passed into limbo.
As a matter of fact, in the Allied Storage case,

this Court refrained, I think., rather significantly, from
even citing the Fort Smith Lumber case.
Now the Allied Storage case is a difficult case, X
will concede,
brief.

Me*ve discussed it at great length in our

I just don’t think there is time to try to get into

it in the oral argument,
We recognise the problem,

lie think the Attorney

General has interpreted that case in a manner far more
broadly than the language of the case warrants.
The real issue, I take it, here, is not what the law
has been but what the law should be.
Shall the accepted rule be changed so as to permit
State Legislatures free reign in indulging their natural
propensities to tar only those property owners who lack the
power to vote, while exonerating from tax those who do not
-- who do — possess that potent weapon, and who are in all
other respects identically situated ?
Now the State here argues, and most specifically in
its reply brief, that this discriminatory tax is not really
a property tax at all.

It is really a franchise tax which

35
masquerades as a property tax.
They say that the Legislature imposed it on
corporations as the price for granting corporations the
privilege of doing business in Illinois.
How that4a an interesting argument.

It was

originally raised in the Santa Clara case 90 years ago.
It was rejected there by Justice Field on the grounJ that,
whatever might have been,that simply was not the purpose of
the tax.
And. the Legislature in California there, and in
Illinois here,did not impose the tax as a franchise tax, did
not intend it as a franchise tax, and there is not a word in
the official argument or explanation to suggest that it is
a franchise tax.
'When, as, and if a State Legislature adopts a

franchise tax in the form of a property tax -- no one ever
has yet, to my knowledge — there will bo time enough for
this Court to consider whether that is a valid form of
taxation.
Certainly, traditionally, courts in general, and
this Court in particular, have generally treated the two
forms of tax, that is a property tax on one hand and excise
taXp including a franchise tax, as being mutually exclusive.
Khw, maybe they are wrong.
God-given about that distinction.

I realise there is nothing
And when Hoses came down

36

from Mount Sinai and looked at his tablet, there was nothing
said there about preserving the distinction between property
taxes and non-property taxes.
But I think the distinction is so imbedded in our
law in the Constitution of the United States, in the Con­
stitution of all States 5.n this Union, in the decisions of
this Court, in State Court decisions, in economic theory, in
legal theory, that to now say that it is all a mistake,
there really is no inherent difference, I think that would be
to show, if nothing else, disrespect to a great deal of
thought that has gone into the subject over the past 200
years,
I might just quote four sentences from an Illinois
Supreme Court decision in Reef v, Barrett, decided in 1934,
at 355 Illinois, where the Court says, and this is quite
typical, 1 think, of judicial thinking, in general:
"A property tax is levied raerely for the purpose of
raising revenue and is levied against property.

It does

not seek, or in any wise attempt to control the use, operation
or regulation of the property.

When the tax is raised, the

mission of the property tax has been fulfilled,

A property

tax has nothing whatever to do with the question of privilege,
license or permission."
I turn, in the time remaining, to the second issue
which we have raised in our brief, that is,the propriety of

37

the remedy decreed by the Illinois Supreme Court..
And the Court understands, I trust, that we agree
with the Illinois Supreme Court’s holding on the invalidity of
the discrimination.

We strongly disagree with its holding

on the remedy.
How, the trial court in Lake Shore had sustained
our position that the appropriate remedy was to invalidate
tax on all taxpayers, the personal property tax on all tax­
payers.
In reaching that conclusion, the trial judge
considered the question of the appropriate remedy was
essentially one of ascertaining the presumed intention of
the people of Illinois, that is whether they would have
approved this amendment if they had known that its effect
was going to be to abolish personal property to taxea in toto.
And in an oral opinion rendered^-* from the bench,
the trial court said, and I quote:
"There was no doubt in the minds of anyone that it
would have passed overwhelmingly even without the words
"as to individuals,’"
That's quoted at page 54 of our brief and page 46
of the record,
How the Illinois Supreme Court reversed on this
issue and, in doing so, that court made no pretense of
ascertaining anyone’s intention.

Q

(inaudible)
MR. FLAMM:

Well, under traditional holdings on the

subject, I think it is.
I recognise that how one goes about ascertaining the
intention of the people on a subject they have never voted
on -- I don't know the answer to that question, ’out I think
theoretically —
Q

(inaudible) the last word as far as this Court,is

concerned ?
MR. FLAMM:

Well, Your Honor, that1a,of course,

a touchy question because I

am

aware that we face that problem

over here and I cannot say with any great confidence that it
is not.
We developed the argument in our brief at considerable
length.

X think, to go back to the old case of Guinn v,

United States, this Court said there that if the State court
has not pronounced State law on the subject to the remedy,
k

-

i

then this Court is free to do so.
Slow, in subsequent decisions, this Court certainly
has honored a State court decision where the State court has
made a finding on the question of intention, but the problem
with the Illinois Supreme Court's decision here is that they
made no pretense of finding anything.

They simply, after

holding the discraaination to be invalid, they said, therefore
the amendment must fall.

39
And there is not a reason given.

One can read that

opinionj 1 suggest, time after tinland not knot? why they
reached that result rather than the result reached by the
trial court.
Wow, if this Court is satisfied that that is a
determination, a ruling, a finding by the State Supreme Court,
then I have to confess I am beaten because the court

if

that is the case, it is a State ruling.
We have argued that it is not a State ruling.

We

further argue that, at least in this case, to permit this
sort of a result would have a severely chilling effect on the
assertion of equal protection rights, at least in the field
of taxation, because if a taxpayer knows that tie can’t win
even if he wins, he is still going to end up subject to the
tax, there aren’t very many people going to challenge taxing
statutes.
I am aware this is the first time this argument
has been advanced in a property case context as distinguished
from a free speech or voting rights case.
I am also aware that this Court,quite properly,
has awarded priority and precedence to personal rights as
compared to property rights, but I think, at least I hope,
that property rights are still a matter entitled to protection
under the Equal Protection Clause, and I think if the Illinois
Supreme Court can do this to us we can forget about any

40
challenges to any taxing statutes in Illinois, at least*
And I might say that there are non on the books in
Illinois, to my knowledge, two or three taxing statutes
enacted In the last year or two, which,quite obviously,
are unconstitutional under the State constitution.
Wobody has brought a challenge to them and I
daresay nobody is going to because they foresee the kind of
result that they are going to get.
We have argued this point in our brief at some
length.

I can’t deny the problem.

In fact, we, at one point

sought to withdraw from this case after the court denied our
— after the court dismissed our appeal.
We sought to appeal, as the Court recalls, directly
from the judgment be lota, on the ground that the remedy
violated our constitutional rights.
The Court dismissed that appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

And at that point, feeling rather discouraged,

we asked leave to get out entirely.
You wouldn’t let us out, so we are back in and
we are still in.

We have rethought the matter and, I hope

that we are still in the ballgaiae on this issue, .
I say we are opposed on the question of the remedy,
but most vociferously by the four school districts which
appear in this Court as amicus.
More disturbingly,wo are opposed on this issue by

41

M. Weil and Sons, one of the respondents in the Shapiro case.
That5 s disturbing because M. Weil and Sons purports
to represent a class of all corporations, including Lake Shore.
The finding to that effect that we have argued is
clearly void, having been entered without a semblance of due
process of law, but nevertheless, having purported to represent
all corporations~ lie now takes the position that the court
below is correct and asks this Court to affirm, even though
the result would be to grant no benefit at all to any
corporations, including Lake Shore, and including M. Weil and
Sons, but Mr. Biro will address the Court on that subject
and perhaps he can explain his position.
Q

There is now in Illinois an income tax in effect?

Or was its effective date postponed for a while?
ME. F1AMM:

The income tax has been in effect since

prior to the adoption of any --of this amendment.
Q

That’s imposed at varying rates and varying

exemptions to both individuals and corporations?
MR. FLAMM:

It is a flat rate tax with a differential

rate on corporations and individuals with rather substantial
exemptions to it, yes.
Q

But that's now presently in effect?
ME* FLAMM:

It is presently in effect, Your Honor.

With the two minutes I have remaining, I would ad­
dress myself to one argument that has been made here and has

been made by the school districts, is that somehow chaos
would result if the decision below were affirmed, that the
school districts would lose $300 million.
How, X am very much concerned with school districts5
financing»

My wife happens to be on a school board, as a

matter of fact, so X get both side3 of the picture.
There is no shortage of means in Illinois to raise
alternative sources of revenue.
My time is up,

I thank the Court for its attention*

MS.. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Flam.

Mr. Biro;
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS L» BIRO, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BIRO:

(71-691)

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At no time in any of the constitutional history
of the State of Illinois,in the content of the constitutions
of the State of Illinois, in either the laws and/or the
statutes of the State of Illinois, has the State ever
recognised a tax on property or an exemption on property
predicated on the type of ownership of that property.
How, obviously, I am excluding the (inaudible)
corporations, e teetera.
The Supreme Court of Illinois, in the instant cases
that are before this Court now, did nothing more and nothing

43
less than follow Che same principle that has been enunciated
throughout the judicial history of our State during that
time,
And,that is,to be valid a classification of property,
for the purposes of property tar imposition or exclusion, ioust
be based-on,related to,or refer ta the differences, if any,
in the property itself, or the characteristics of the property
itself,

and In one instance, perhaps, even the form of the

property itself.
And, in order to find any support under the law,
particularly under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution,
as we see it, the Supreme Court of Illinois, I think, succinctlytouched on this, although the other gentlemen who have
appeared here beforehand do not seem to agree.
And, if the Court will look at the Attorney
General's Appendix at page 29, there is a quote in the
opinion, and if I may — I know the Court is not particularly
anxious -» it is a very short section that I have taken out
of the Court's opinion —
Q

Justice Schaefer's opinion?
MEL BIRO:

Justice Schaefer’s opinion, yes.

And, if I may —
Q

What page, Mr, Biro?

%

MR, BIRO:
Appendix, I am sorry.

Page 29 of the Attorney General's

44
It is the handbooks Justice*
"The new article classifies personal property for the
purpose of imposing a property tax by valuation, upon a
basis that does not depend upon

any

of the characteristics

of the property that is taxed, or upon the use to which it
is put, but solely upon the ownership of the property.”
.iEf

the

property is owned by

A, it

is

taxable*

If it is owned by B, it cannot be taxed.
Of course, the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit classification, and
absolute precision is not required of the States in drawing
the lines between classes.
Nevertheless, the State may not, under the guise
of classification, arbitrarily, discriminate against one and
in favor of another similarly situated.
«

I respectfully point out that the question was
asked before about differences that might appear in other
States.
The question as to — has not the question come
up before of distinctions that were in there?
And I think the word “guise" is probably the most
important word in the latter part of Mr. Justice Schaefer’s

if is.
In effect, what Article 9 did is to place the
property itself on one side and say that the type of ownership
is really going to be the criterion,
And I respectfully submit to you that what they are
talking about is a privilege tax.
This is not a property tax if you do it this way.
You are taking a privilege tax and —

-A.

Wow, as I stated, the Illinois Constitution of 1870

,

the Illinois Constitution of 1970, contains in its revenue
articles, no word that has the spelling out of the word
'’individual.'*
The Illinois Revenue Act of 1939, the word individual

46
does not appear.
That designation appears, 1 respectfully submit,
for the first time in Article 9(a), which is the article
that comes before this, and seeks to prohibit a taxation
that is nowhere actually imposed, because if you read our
constitution, and you read our Revenue Act, there is no
place where it says a, quote, individual shall pay this tax,
or an individual slmll pay that tax.
With due deference to Mr. Kaplan,who pointed out
to this Court that it is accepted among the members of the
legal profession that the word "individual1'* has a specific
meaning, I stand before this Court and tell you that this is
one member of the bar who does not know what individual means.
I do not find it in our statute.

I do not find it

in our constitution, and suddenly, for the first time, there
is language that says that was given to the electorate, if
you will, that individuals shall be exempt.
How, Article 9(a) purports to prohibit the
taxation of personal property by valuation, by, as to,
individuals.
Nowhere in all of Article 9 docs the word
"individual" appear.
Nowhere in the Revenue Act of 1939 does the word
"Individual" appear,
Nowhere does Article 9 impose a tax by valuation on

47
a si individual.
And the Illinois Constitution does not direct
that any tax shall bo levied on an individual.
The corporations — M. Weil and Sons — I can't
speak.
with me.

Obviously, you heard Mr. Flaram, who is not in accord
M. Weil and Sons respectfully submit that unless

the exclusion of Article 9(a) applies to us also,

by —

I am speaking of corporations.
I don't know what an individual is,

I don't know

where the distinction comes in —
Q

The Illinois Supreme Court settled that question

when it said on page A-11 of the Fetition for Writ of
Certiorari — that’s a copy of Justice Schaefer’s opinion,-"We conclude that the meaning of Article 9(a) is that
ad valorem taxation of personal property owned by a natural
person or by two or more natural persons, as joint tenants
or tenants in common, is prohibited,"
Now, doesn’t that purport to answer the question
of what is meant by individual?
MU. BIRO:

It purports to answer it, obviously,

insofar as the Court is concerned, but I am respectfully
pointing out that £— in my brief, I point out to this Court
that I take issue with the ultimate conclusion that was
raised in there.
q

But that’s a matter of Illinois law, and the meaning

48
of that: provision in 9(a) we must take.
not

&

Federal question,

Me

here -- that's

it is a matter of definition and

that has been settled by the Illinois Supreme Court,
I®. BIRO:

I unfortunately came to the conclusion.

Your Honor, and for that reason X touched on it in ay brief
only to the extent that X felt that it should be brought to
this Court*8 attention.
Q

Me. Biro, would you consider a partnership to be

within the definition enunciated by the Illinois Supreme
Court?

Two natural persons fora a partnership?
I®. BIRO:

Evidently.

I am assuming that from

what the Illinois Supreme Court has stated in this case, that,
in effect,we are back at exactly the same taxing procedure
that we were at prior to the time that the question was
raised in these cases before that dourt.
So that, Mr. Flamm states he does not understand
why I appeared here.
Unfortunately, we attorneys unfortunately
maybe it’s fortunately

— or

obviously cannot always see all

issues the same way.
With due respect to this Court, I notice that there
are, quote, split decisions that come down.
It was my feeling that in the case,as it was brought
up initially,that my client’s interests were not adequately
protected.

49
It was also my fooling that — I hoar figures
thrown around constantly as to how much money is collected in
Cook County.

And, unfortunately, in a. State such as ourr,

we tend to be two States when people talk about us, because
we have the same difficulty that the State of Row York ;eems
to have, up-State, down-state and a large metropolitan area,
and the rest of the State.
And, obviously, to a great extent the southern part
of our State is the agricultural basis.

As a result of that,

when figures are put out as to what money is collected and
what money is not collected, it is my feeling that if there
was an unconstitutional attempt made here, and if my client,
my corporate entity, if you will, was going to be put in the
position where it was going to bo forced to pick up part of
the slag that was dropped because of improper action,
regardless of what amount of money that would bo saved by it,
I felt that I was adequately and properly representing ay
client in following through on that.
I state only that we get down to a basic question,
if the Court please, that Article 9(a) is constitutionally
offensive.
i

.

I feel it violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution, and 1 respectfully submit that this
Court should so hold.
Thank you.
