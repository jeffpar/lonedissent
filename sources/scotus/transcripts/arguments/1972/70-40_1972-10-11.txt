MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 70-40, Doe against Bolton.
Mrs. Hamas# you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARGIE PITTS HAKES #
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. HAMESs Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Courts
This is an appeal from the decision in the Northern
District Court of Georgia# wherein that court below l

.VI

portions of a model penal code type abortion statute
unconstitutional# and upheld other provisions# and refused to
issue an injunction in support of the declaratory judgment.
The case was filed on behalf of Mary Doe# a pregnant
woman# doctors# nurses# ministers# social workers# and
family planning organisations# aa a class action seeking
declaratory injunctive relief.

The District Court found that the right of privacy
there did include the right to terminate an unwanted
pregnancy# without hanging the case on any particular provisio
in the Constitution, but relying primarily on this Court's
decision in Griswold.
The court found that the specification of three
reasons for abortion in our statute was unduly restrictive
and overbroad

4
Mary Doe was given a declaratory judgment.

However,,

v.r.'3 physicians and other parties ? even though said to have
sufficient standing? lacked sufficient collision of interest?
and therefore the ease was dismissed as to them.
Thxs case stands on similar jurisdictional grounds,,
as the Eoa vs. Wade case? which we’ve just heard.
I would point to only two eases on the jurisdictional
point? one is Wisconsin vs. Con3fcantineau? which dealt with a
third party’s constitutional rights there? and then the
discussion in the Hlaenatadt_y&. Baird case? the recent ease
of this Court.
The facts of this case involved Mary Doe? who was
a 22-year-old woman? married, she’d given birth to threeprevious children? two of whom had been taken away from her
by the State authorities because aha was unable to care for
them. The third child? she was required by her husband to
placa with adoptive parents.
Mrs. Dc-s requested an abortion at the public
hospitalf where she was entitled to free medical service*
She was an indigent person, by the way.
Her marriage had been unstable? and during the
pendency of her pregnancy her husband abandoned her.

She was

about ten or eleven weeks when this lawsuit was commenced?
and she subsequently applied to private physicians in Atlanta?
and a private hospital? for an abortion; and that application

was approved.

She was turned down, however, by the public

hospital.
The abortion statute in Georgia, as 1 said, is
modeled after the model penal code, and was adopted in 19fit.
The prior law was adopted in 1076, and it was of the Texas
type, to save the life of the woman statute.
The Legislature, in 1968, however, permitted
abortion for three reasonss

rape; likelihood of grave and

permanent or irrexaedial fetal malformation; and danger to
the life of the woman or serious and permanent injury to
her health.
These were the reasons that the court below
declared unconstitutional.

They left standing, however,

the procedures in the statute.

The residency requirement,

the requirement that a doctor have two consultants, the
hospital abortion committee approval requirement of at
least three more doctors, and the requirement that all
abortions be performed in accredited licensed hospitals,
that is, those accredited by the O'oint Commission on
Hospital Accreditation.

And there were several other

reporting requirements that were left standing.
Appellants here contend that it's not necessary
to debate the fetal life problem in the Georgia case, because,
as the District Court recognised, the Georgia statute is
aimed at protecting the health of the woman.

Judge Smith said

I
6

that the whole thrust of the present statute

to treat the

problem as a medical one.
The only compelling interest that has been asserted
by the State, however, is the interest in preserving fetal
life.
In talcing this position, the State has found itself
in a very

in several inconsistent positions.

That is,

they have abandoned the fetuses that are the product of rape,
they have abandoned those that might likely be malformed,
and they have abandoned those that might endanger the life and
the health of the woman.
So that if the State claims an interest in fetal
life, they have abandoned some and are protecting others.
The State is in the further inconsistent position
because, under its Public Health Code and Family Planning
Service, it has, as a medical service, inserted several
thousand intrauterine devices, which substantial medical
opinion holds either destroys the product of conception or
prevents implantation of the fertilized egg or embryo.
The brief on behalf of the State has argued that
the right to life begins at the moment of conception, and
we would point this out as another inconsistency in their
argument.
Abortion is not a new medical procedure — or maybe
it's not a new procedure, 1 should say; illegal abortions

!

have been performed for many years.

There are not any

statistics that are very reliable on these, but writers
in the area estimate several thousand per year in the United
States, and several thousand deaths have occurred from
illegal abortions.
I think the real question that this Court is faced
with is whether abortion is going to be made a legal health
service for women, or whether it’s going to be kept in the
illegal realm and handled by the unskilled, so-called nonmedical practitioners.
1' believe 1 pointed out before,, in the prior
argument, that we have had some 23, 25 cases now reported
involving abortions in Georgia? and many of those involved
nurses or contractors, and I believe a plumber in one case,
hud you can find those kinds of cases all over the United
States, of women placing their life in the hands of an
unskilled abortionist.
Therefore, we feel that the statute must be viewed
in a health context.

1579 women received abortions in

Georgia in 1971, and 3410 woman, Georgia women, went to New
York for abortions.

We do not have any statistics available

for the District of Columbia, California, and other more
liberal States.
I give you these statistics to shew that there is
still a considerable limitation on the availability of

8
abortion services in Georgia.
X think the reasons that these limitations ar
there are apparent from the face of the statute as it
remains.

The procedures are that three doctors, two

consultants, and a hospital abortion committee of three
doctors isf on its face, a very time-consuming procedure,
not only for the woman but for the doctors.

Of course, time

is a very important factor in the decision to terminate a
pregnancy.

For two reasons:

does increase as time goes on.

the risk to a woman’s life .
First trimester abortions

are safer than late abortions.
Complications are three to four times higher in
the second trimester.
In a study that was conducted at the public
hospital in Atlanta, which is cited in our original brief
at page 36, Doctors Baker and Freeman showed that 54 percent
of the applicants for abortion were forced to discontinue
their application altogether.

So their alternatives were to

go to New York, if they had money — and they wouldn't have
been applying to the public hospital in the first place,
because they would have bean ineligible for treatment there
or to resort to a fifty-dollar illegal abortion in Atlanta,
or — and of course a $500 illegal abortion in Atlanta
wouldn't have been available to them — or to place the
child for adoption or rear the child.

9
That study further shows that by the end of the
work-up period of all the paperwork, that 56 percent of those
applicants at that hospital had heec-ma second trimester
pregnancies, that is later procedure, the saline procedure.
Wot only is this a time-consuming procedure, it is
costly to the patient.

We know that abortions in Georgia

cost from four to six hundred dollars# that is# a hospital
abortion under all of the procedures of the statute.

You

can pay airplane fare and go to New York for an abortion for
about $225.
So it*8 no wonder that so many women choose the
alternative of going away from home for abortion services.
They cannot afford the three consultants and to check into a
hospital in Georgia.
In addition, we feel that the procedures are not
fair to the woman, or to the doctor.
before the abortion committee.
woman to foe heard, in any event.

There is no hearing

There is no right for the
Some abortion committees

do permit doctors to corns? some of them transact their
hospital abortion committee business by telephone; some by
review of charts only.
There is no right on behalf of tbs woman to know
the reason she’s turned down, and there’s no right to have a
review of the decision,

tod the committee procedure, we

contend, is, in mid of itself, an invasion of the patient’s

10
privacy.

Not only must she reveal to her doctor the

private information or the private reaeons for which she
wants the abortion, but they are then — this information,
she has to give it to two other consultants, a hospital
abortion committee, and it becomes a permanent part of the
record of the State.
So we feel that the whole committee procedure is
devoid of fairness and due process.
It also raises substantial conflict of interest
problems«

This i3 primarily because of the doctor.
The limitation of abortion to accredited hospitals

is also limiting the availability of this service to Georgia
women*

The Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation has

the privilege — requirement, rather, 1 believe is contained
in only 4 of the 13 ALI type statutes, and this is not
included as a recommendation in the Uniform Abortion Act,
which was, last February, approved by the American Bar
Association.
Xn the recent case in Kansas and Maryland, both
recognise this places a substantial limitation on the
availability of facilities.

Even in Maryland, where only

two hospitals were not accredited, the Court recognised that.
And in Georgia we have some ISO — out of our 159 counties,
only 54 have accredited hospitals.
We say that the Georgia statute — in this Georgia

11
statute it is said that the JCAH is to establish standards
for the hospital abortion committee.

We have argued that

this is an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.
In fact/ JCAH just does not operate in this

:

er in this

area, and it is a recognised principle of law in Georgia that
delegation of legislative authority to private individuals or
private organisations is an improper delegation.
Also we would point out that the limitation to
accredited hospitals is shown to be unwarranted by the ami
York experience.
There was an article in Sunday's New York Times
which reported the substantial number of abortions in New
York? but, more significantly, it found that there war© only
4.6 deaths per 100,000 live births the first year, and 3.S
the second year.
So that the New York clinical experience has proved
to ba successful.
QUESTIONS

Mrs. Homes, is there any limit to the

judicial notice which we can take?

i mean, is last Sunday's

newspaper a perfectly permissible thing for ’as to rely on
in deciding a case like this?
MRS. HAMESt

Your Honor, 1 think that this study

is & published document.

It is a very recent published

document, but it is something -that does receive wide
circulation as a Public Health Department report.

I do not

12
have a copy of it* because it is such a recent report.
There are similar reports by the u. S. Public Health Department.
We have previously furnished reports to the Court’s library,
and will be happy to do so on the statistical information.
I do recognise
QUESTION:

Well, aren't such things something that

go to legislative judgment rather than constitutional
evaluation?
MRS. HAMES: X think that it is important that
legislatures not encumber a fundamental constitutional right
with so many procedures as to effectively manipulate it out
of existence.
requirement:

And this is our argument about the JCAH
that to limit abortions to accredited hospitals,

in many instances deprives women of their fundamental right
to decide whether or not to have the child.
And X think that that is not properly a legislative
judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, you were just talking about

statistics, however, in recent reports, and this kind of
tiling, rather than JCAH.
MRS. HAMESs Well, I would also, instead of the
Hew York Times, which 1 recognise is not a very widely
accepted source for judicial notice, however a highly
recognised newspaper, X would cite a study by Dr. Christopher
Tietse, who is the recognised medical authority in the area

13
of statistics, in which he finds that complications are
lower —
QUESTION s

When you say "the'’ recognised

authority, you mean there are no others?
MRS. K&MESs
QUESTION;

Well, 2 —
"a".

MRS. H&MES s

"a", excuse me.

QUESTION: All right.
MRS. HAMES:

He finds that complications are lower

in clinics than in hospitals, and were lower for hospital
outpatients than for in-patients.
QUESTION:

And that study is found --

But don’t you think there are other

factors there, that more complicated cases go into hospitals,
that the more complicated cases are- in-patients rather than
outpatients?
MRS. HAMES:

He took that into consideration in

arriving at his statistics.
pointed that out.

I’m sorry, 2 should have

Complications for abortion by the suction

curettage method, excluding pre-existing complications, cases,
this is strictly the normal abortion situation, the normal
patient.
We also say that the procedures imposed on the
abortion service, is not imposed on other medical service.
And I foelievo that point has been previously made from the
bench

14

We feel that the State would have an interest in
regulating the quality of a health service just in this
area, just as they would in other areas.
of how much.

It's a question

And I think that it could be adequately

regulated through the rules and regulations of the health
department, as are the licensing requirements for hospitals.
QUESTION:

Mrs, Haines, let me inquire there:

Would

you oppose a Georgia statute which said that an abortion
must be performed by a licensed physician?

And may not ba

performed .by a midwife or a registered nurse, or something
of that kind?
MRS. HAMES:

Your Honor, at the time that this

lawsuit was brought I would probably have said that I would
limit abortion services to being performed by licensed
physicians.

However, the medical technology and knowhow in

this area is developing very fast.
course, are doing abortions.

Medical students, of

And I think that midwives are

going to be learning to do abortions.

So that by the time

I say it it may be out of date.
QUESTION: Well, then you're making a constitutional
issue out of these new facts.

What I'm asking you is, whether

you feel a Georgia statute, confining the abortive process to
a 11 car*sod physician would ba unconstitutional?
MRS. HAMES:

Probably not.

I feel, at this time,

it would probably not be unconstitutional.

But in the future

IS
it may be outdated and outlive its constitutionality as have
other statutes QUESTION: So the constitutionality will change
depending on the advancement of medical knowledge?
MRS. HAMES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir* 1 think that's possible.
Mrs. Names, would you think it

constitutional to require that the abortion be performed in
an accredited hospital?
MRS# HAMES:
QUESTION:

In a Joint Commission —
In a hospital licensed oy the State of

Georgia, first of all.
MRS» HAMES:

I think that that depends on each

State's particular situation.

And it depends on whether

your licensing requirements are so strict that that would in
turn effectively manipulate out of existence the same
fundamental right we're talking about.

In Georgia, it is

my tuaderstanding that the minimum requirement for a licensed
hospital is two beds.

So that you can run all the way

from a very large hospital and requiro lots of facilities
to the two-bed situation.
I think that abortions should be performed in
specialised facilities, regulated by the State.
are designed for abortion services.

Those that

And of course, in the

regulations you can require -that they be close to hospitals
for backup services? but I think that clinics are fully

16
capable , by -virtue of the New York experience statistics
that I was citing, to afford effective and safe abortion
services.
QUESTION 5

Then you are conceding that the State

.

may license an abortion facility?
MBS. HAKESs
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And I take it, if I heard you correctly,

that among its requirements it may require — it may list
proximity to a licensed hospital?
MRS. HAMES:

I'm saying that maybe one of the forms

that the body who draws the rules and regulations may want
to require.

I believe that is true in New York City.

QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking you whether you would

regard this as a constitutional restriction.
MRS. HAMES:

Well, I think you'd have to look at

each fact, situation, and in New York City it probably would not
but in some of the more rural areas it may be that you could
have a safe abortion facility without being close to an
emergency facility.
QUESTION:

And I also take it from what you said

before that you're reserving the right to say it isn’t
constitutional twenty years from now?
MSS. HAMES:

That's correct.

I would point out that if you put the abortion
facilities under the licensure requirements of the State,

17

Procedure Act in drawing up the rules and regulations.

And

this is quite different from turning over rules and regulations
to JCAH, which is a private organization in Chicago, over
which citizens of Georgia have no control.
I would like to speak for just a moment about the
doctors9 interest, because this action was brought on behalf
of a group of doctors, and we have asserted their rights in
tiiis Court.
We assert the physicians’ right to practice their
professions.

And we say that these procedural requirements

interfere with the best professional judgment, or interfere
with their practicing their profession in accordance with
their best professional judgment.
It puts them, it puts the doctor, the whole area of
having abortion, in the criminal lav/ area; it puts the doctor
in the position of always having to weigh his interest against
the vroman’s interest.

If he thinks it’s doubtful, ha’s

not going to do it, ha’s going to resolve the question in
his own favor, so that he won’t go to jail.
If he — and I think this is a conflict of interest
situation that ws should not put the doctor in.

And the

Medical Association of Georgia, in its last legislative
effort, was for leaving the entire area of abortion unregulated
by the Legislature, but leaving it as a medical practice

18
matter.

Go that the illegal abortionist would be guilty of

practicing medicine without a license» which is a misdemeanor
in Georgia.

But it would take the whole area of abortion

out from under the criminal statute,
QUESTION:

Mrs. Harness, X suppose doctors are not

alone in being eager to have their profession or occupation
wholly taken out from State regulation.

Aren't there a lot

of professional associations, other than doctors, that
certainly subscribe to that notion?
MRS. HAMES;

I think we lawyers dislike having

our profession regulated, and I would dislike being told that
1 had to do so many antitrust cases or divorce cases per
month.
QUESTIONS

And yet professions end occupations

have been traditionally regulated by the State for a long
time *
MRS. HAMES* Well, 1 think that the regulation here
is too much, it comes down to a matter of degree, 1 think.
QUESTION!

Well, but X think — don’t you think

your argument is on a stronger ground there than to tell us
how the Georgia Medical Association last month decided it
didn’t want any regulation?

That doesn’t really bear on the

constitutional issue here, does it?
MRS. HAMESs

But it indicates only the attitude of

the medical profession in Georgia.

Anci 1 think that is

19
important.

Of course# as you say, everybody would like to be

out from under regulation.
QUESTION:

The bakers in lochner vs. Slew York didn't

want to be regulated, either.
MRS. HAKES: Well, this is the only instance that I
know of where doctors submit their medical judgment to a
committee of three, and that committee of three has the right
to override the practicing physician's judgment.

And I think

this is the type of regulation, or the degree, that I object
to.
QUESTION:

Isn’t there a professional regulation

in virtually every hospital in the country on surgical
procedures, so that if the doctor is thought to be performing
unnecessary operations of any kind, appendectomies,
tonsillectomies, or whatnot, he can be disciplined?
MRS. HAMES: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION s

He has a restraint on him in many other-

areas, apart from abortion, doesn’t he?
MRS. HAMESs

Yes, but that doesn't make him a

criminal if he doesn’t follow them.

They, then, can revoke

his staff privileges.
QUESTION:

It might*

Of course we don’t know.

MRS. HAMES: Well, it is possible, but I think that
what 1 would say is to leave it up to the professional
standards.

And if a hospital chooses to have a committee,

20
they might want to run their business that way; but let's
don't make it mandatory for the woman to exercise his right
to have to submit her case to the hospital committee.
QUESTIONs

Mrs. Hasses, have you studied the 1970

draft of the Uni.form Abortion Act, recommended by the
Uniform Committee, enough to have an opinion as to its
constitutionality?
MRS. HAKES:

It's my recollection that it dot-s

have a time limitation in it, is that correct?
I think that — it's my recollection that there are
no consultants required, no committee, no limitation on
facility, but a twenty-week limitation with some exceptions,
as I recall.

I would think it's constitutional.

QUESTION s

You mean the State is free to protect

the life of the fetus by saying that no abortions after
twenty weeks, with some exceptions?
MRS. HAKESs

I'm not prepared to aay twenty weeks,

but X am prepared to say that the reason for enacting
abortion laws in the very beginning was to protect the
health of the mother.
QUESTION:

Yes, but —

MRS. HAKES: And that that reason may come back into
existence at some period during the pregnancy.

So that it

could be —
QUESTION:

You're saying that the State may put a

21
limit on abortions# timewise, in the period of pregnancy?
MRS. HAMBS:
possible.

Yes# Your Honor# I think that's

That's not involved in the Georgia ease# there’s

no time limitation in our statute at all.
QUESTION:

I understand.

MRS, HAKESs

I would like to reserve some time.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well# Mrs. Haines.
Mrs. Beasley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. DOROTHY T. BEASLEY#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRS. BEASLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
Underlying this suit is an appeal by pregnant
women to the federal judiciary# and particularly this Court#
for an enunciation that they have a right secured by our
Constitution to procure the destruction of their living,
unborn children.

They make this plea because the people

in the State of Georgia forbid abortion except in certain
circumstances# which the people of our State# through the
Legislature# believe constitute justifiable homicide.
I do not. directly represent the unborn children
*

v

here# nor the child of Mar;/ Doe# who i3 probably now two years
old.
Thsir representation by a guardian ad litem was

22
denied by the court below.
I do, however, represent three State and local
officials of the government at this argument, and in that
capacity I do represent the State in defending the statute
attacked.
The State is parens patriae here, exerting the
sovereign power of guardianship over persons under
disability, standing, as it ware, in loco parentis, or in
place of the parent, here the mother, in defending the unborn
child.
Now, before we get into whatever issues there may
be before this Court with respect to that very basic
fundamental underlying issue, I think we must look at it in
the context of -the jurisdiction of this Court, for which the
proposition is presented.
Mary Boe and the other appellants, whom 1 wish to
refer to as plaintiffs, because 1 think they have no business
here as appellants, brought this action under Section 12
excuse me — 1903.

This is a 1903 action, which was brought

in the federal court below, and a three-judge court was
requested.
But that action which gives them a cause or a right
or a claim says that every person v?ho, under color of any
State statute, subjects or causes to be subjected any
citizen to the deprivation of any rights which are protected

23
by the Constitution, has a cause of action.
So you start out first withz
Constitution is being abridged?

Or

what right under the

what right is Mary Doe

and the other plaintiffs alleging exists?
The burden is on Mary Doe to show what the
constitutional right is# in the first place, because she
has a cause of action.
And that question comes before this Court because,
as this Court has not yet ruled on its jurisdiction, its
jurisdiction depends on the jurisdiction of the District
Court.

If the District Court didn't have jurisdiction over

this 1983 case, obviously there would be no jurisdiction in
this Court.
Now# to begin with, since she must show what this
right is, and the burden is on her, this Court can decide
that question, which is a part of its jurisdictional question,
because if there was no constitutional right in the beginning
then the District Court had no business looking at the State
statute and measuring it against that constitutional right.
QUSSTIONs Well, Mrs. Beasley, are you claiming that
if I bring

a 1983 action in the Georgia court, and the court,

after granting a hearing, decides that I lose, I didn't have
& constitutional right under 1983, then the court never
had jurisdiction in the first place?
MRS. BEASLEYi

That's right.

If there was no

constitutional right in the first place, there’s no 1983action ,
QUESTION* Well, but isn’t that what a court has to
hear and determine, and doesn’t jurisdiction mean the power
to hear and determine and decide against a plaintiff?
MRS, BEASLEY:

Yes, indeed.

But if that cereiitv .

tional right is lacking, then it has no jurisdiction to go any
further, because then there is no deprivation of a
constitutional right,
QUESTION:

Yes, hut you need a throe-judge court to

decide that.
MRS. BEASLEY:

Net at all.

You don’t need a three-

judge court to decide it is a constitutional right, you need
a three-judge court to determine if there is jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

If you decide it is a frivolous claim,

you do.
MRS. BEASLEY:

You probably would have to make that

determination.
QUESTION: Well, if it isn’t a frivolous claim, you
need a three-judge court; and if the three-judge court turns
you down, you can appeal directly here, can’t you?
MBS. BEASLEY: That’s right.

And that’s why the

question is ultimately here, because this Court must
determine the jurisidetion of the court below.

So that we

say that all these arguments and all these statistics with

25
regard to the statute itself are irrelevant to the argument
here? that they have nothing to do at all with the argument
here, because Mary Doe and the other plaintiffs cannot
establish the constitutional right in the beginning, which
they say was abridged by the existence of the statute.
QUESTION:

But you at least have got to argue

whether or not that constitutional right exists?
MRS. BEASLEY; Right.

Exactly.

And that's why I

think this Court, at least, has jurisdiction, Mr. Justice
Relinquish, to determine that a woman does not have a right
secured by our Constitution to terminate the life of her
unborn child arbitrarily.

This Court can make that

determination in this suit, despite all the other lack of
jurisdiction of the court below with regard to operation
of the statute, or the application of the statute, or all
these other peripheral issues.
Now, the burden, as I said, is on the woman who
is exerting -this so-called right, to establish that she has
it, that it is secured by our Constitution.

But I submit

•that it is not, there is no such right.
And for several reasons that I think are very
fundamental.

Abortion, of course, is the killing of a human

fetus or embryo.

The victim of criminal abortion is the

fetus, not the mother.

The victim is the fetus.

So it’s a crime, rp«ogniz<sd by the State, against

\

26
the unborn child,

tod that was ana reason why I brought to

your attention that little booklet published by the State in
1922, in the Supplemental Authorities.

It's.called 5iIn Loco

Parentis", and it was published by the State Welfare Department,,
and it has to do with all of the statutes of the State and
the decisions of the State protecting children.
tod under the caption, "Laws Protecting Children"
ares

crimes against children, and that’s where abortion is

discussed.

1922.
QUESTION:

I suppose when the State appropriates

money to maintain a pre-natal clinic, this is under the State’s
broad parens patriae authority to take care of its people, is
it not?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

that's correct, and that's —
QUESTION:

They're taking care of both the mother

and the potential child?
MRS. BEASLEY:

That is precisely one of the

manifestations of the State's interest, not only in the mother
but also in the unborn child.
QUESTION: But you wouldn't contend, would you, that
the State would have authority to enact a statute or to
sustain a statute that would forbid tonsillectomies, for
example?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Not at all, but there again the

great distinction is that there is not another entity,
human entity, involved? which there is here*

had that;8 s

the source of the protection here.
QUESTION: Well, but suppose the State pointed to
the fact that sometimes people die. in the process of having
their tonsils removed, which they do, perhaps one out of vary
200,000 or some such figure.
MRS. BEASLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, the State —

And that on that ground they were

going to forbid performing of tonsillectomies.

Would you

think the State could sustain that against the constitutional
—*• on a constitutional basis?
MRS. BEASLEY:

I don't think a constitutional

basis would be involved, but under the police power of the
State to protect health and safety, it could proscribe
tonsillectomies, at least so that it was related to health.
\ *

Now, if it went

* it might be overbroad, because, as a

matter of fact, all tonsillectomies may not be dangerous,
and may be a health measure.

But that has little to do with

the purpose of the State in prohibiting abortion.
Because that would be a health measure, and despite
what the Mary Doe and the other plaintiffs or appellants
say here, and despite what the court said below, the purpose
of this criminal abortion statute of Georgia is not health.
QUESTION:

Well, it relates, does it not, in seme

28
general way to what limitations the State may place on
people, itspsople, does it not?
MRS. BEASLEY2

Yes, it does, indeed.

It’s a very

direct restriction on the performance of such operations„
So -»
QUESTION?

Mrs. Beasley — excuse me; go ahead.

MRS. BEASLEY; Go aheadf Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION;

I'm a little confused.

You say that the.

State is interested in protecting the life of the fetus,
and yet. the State statute, under certain conditions, allows
•the death of the fetus.
MRS. BEASLEY:

That's right.

There is a balancing

of the interests, which we have talked about so much.
tinder the

Mary Doe suggests that she has a right,

hach emanates from —
QUESTION:

Is there any other statute in Georgia

which says under certain conditions you can kill somebody?
MRS. BEASLEY;

Yes — well, we used to have

capital punishment statutes.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any statute in Georgia

that says that commission of three people can decide whether
a man lives or dies?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Not a commission of three people.

QUESTION; Well, is there any statute which says
three doctors can decide whether a man lives or dies?

29
Obviously ~MR8. BEASLEY:
or dies.

E::cuse me, not as to whether he lives

But there is
QUESTIONs

— there is no such statute.

But you

can say, three doctors can decide as to whether what you
claim is a living fetus, with the exact same rights as a
grown person- can be killed.
MRS. BEASLEY:
Baying that.

No, I'm not saying that.

What I am saying is this:

I'm not

under our

Constitution, obviously, as Mr. Justice Stewart said, a person
•that's born has all the protections that the Constitution
has to offer.

But there is a gray area where we don't know

when life, as such, begins, or humanity, or personhood, or
any other term by which you want to call it.

Obviously

life occurs before birth, because there's movement, and
medicine recognises that.
So let’s not talk about life then, let's, just say
personhood, which of course is not a medical term at all.
QUESTION: Well, what is a fetus?
MRS. BEASLEY;

There’s a gray area, and that is the

area in which we say the State has a right to determine, by
its Legislature, haw far it will go in protecting that,
because it's a matter of public policy.
QUESTION;

Is it a living being or not?

MRS. BEASLEY:

Indeed it is a living being, and I

30
don't think anybody conId dispute that.
QUESTION?

And you have a right, with the

permission of three doctors, to kill the, quota, ’’living
being" end quote?
MSS* BEASLEYt . Because the State also recognises
the competing interest of self-preservation that the nether
has in extreme circumstances.

The statute doesn't allow the

"*•- the exceptions are not. broad, the exceptions are very
narrow.

The health must be very seriously impaired.
QUESTION:

being point.

I have great problem with the living

I think that's my problem, where it is.

And

do you have to go so far to sustain your position as to say
that the fetus is a living being?

Why don’t you treat it as

a fetus?
MSS. BEASLEY:

I think that's a matter of

terminology.
QUESTION:

That's why I was distinguishing it bore.

MRS. BEASLEY:

Of course.

Let’s call it a fetus,

then.
The State, it is our position, has a right in this
gray area, where we can’t say the particular moment at which
the State can protect human beings or fetuses, or whatever
area on the continuum of. life that you want to talk about.
But there is a right, we think, that a living being
has, which emanates from the Ninth Amendment itself.

Because

31
those rights are retained by the people, under the Ninth
Amendment.

And «*QUESTION:

Well, you can't give — you can't

recognise the Ninth Amendment for the fetus and not recognise
the Ninth Amendment for the mother# can you?
MBS. BEASLEYs

If you recognise both# then you

simply will have to justify some — find some common median
way in order to determine the interest.

That’s what is

really at issue here# the conflicting interest between the
two.
But under the common lav?# and under natural law#
according to Blacksfcone and Cobb# and we still rely on these
despite what Professor Means may say? and I cite to the Court
strongly the history of the common law# which was put out
in 1865* the booklet which w© cited in our first brief# the
Storer and Heard book# describing tha caseo before any
statute was enacted in England# where abortion was regarded as
a crime.

It was not a felony.

if it had bean a felony.

You asked the question earlier#

Ho# it was a misdemeanor.

But# regardless of whether it was a felony or a
misdemeanor at common law# it was regarded as a misdemeanor
in Georgia# and although there are not cases before the
statute was enacted in 1865# the cases around that time#
including the 1849 case of Morrow vs. Scott# speak of the
unborn child as having any right which the State was able to

32
give it, whatever rights were protectable insofar as it was
protectable.
QUESTION*

Mrs» Beasley# I think# if my memory

serves me correctly# the last time around I asked you why the
situation as to incest was left out of the Georgia statute.
Have you been able to trace that down at all?
MRS * BEASLEY:

Yes# Mr. Justice Elackir-un.

I

apologise for so late providing to the Court the legislative
history# such as it is# in the North Carolina Population
Center study on this statute.
But it indicates in there that the thought was -that
rape included incest.

And# as a matter of fact# the

statistics which are kept by the Georgia Department of Public
Health# Maternal Health Section# classify incest separately
from rape# and indicate that prior to the time the statute
was emasculated by the court below abortions were being
performed and were being reported and were not being
prosecuted under the title "incest " as opposed to rape.
So that# as a matter of practice# it has included
that.
QUESTIONThe other question I have# while I have
you interrupted:

In your list of supplemental authorities#

which you’ve submitted without particular explanation, are
soma# what I take it to be# proposed bills in Georgia which
would change your current statute.

Am I correct in that

33
impression?
MRS. BEASLEY:

That’s right.

There were two.

QUESTION: Would you have some comment on those?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, sir.

I thank you for asking

about them.
I submitted those for this proposition f* to show
that even though the statute, as it was passed in 1963,
there are still efforts being made to change it, and'that,
despite the fact that after the District Court changed the
statute and really wrote its own statute, because it gave an
entirely different purpose to the statute than the Legislature
had, efforts were made and they were still knocked down.
Those statutes were not passed because they were too liberal
with respect to dealing with the fetus.
QUESTION:

Is that supplemental statement in the

form of a brief?
MRS. BEASLEY:

No, it isn’t.

I moved very lately

to file supplemental authorities, and I simply listed them.
Because 2 felt that, as shown by the stack in front of you,
Mr. Justice Douglas, there were so many briefs that it would
be superfluous for me to try to submit another supplemental
brief? so I simply listed the authorities so that I might
be able to talk toyou about them in the argument.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beasley, supposing that the Georgia

Legislature, on evidence presented before one of its

34

committees, were to determine that there had been, say,
more than 50 percent fatalities in connection with open-heart
surgery that had been performed in Georgia, and as a result
of that the Legislature were to

-.-act a law prohibiting

open-heart surgery in the State of Georgia.

On your theory,

would that be a constitutional exercise of legislative ui.tr?
MSS* BEASLEY:

It might be under a health measure,

public policy to protect health*

That’s not what is

involved hare*
This is not to protect the health of the person
who wants the operation, which is what you would have in the
open-heart surgery.

Legislation to protact the life or the

health, and the polio© power comas in there, to protect the
life of one who wants it, or the one whose doctor thinks
they ought to have it.
But that's not the purpose of the Georgia abortion
statute*

It is not health related, or primarily health

related*

That is not its primary purpose, and I think that

this study of the North Carolina Population Center, which,
by the way, in the vary preface to tha study, says that the
reason they were doing it was to assist those who might be
trying to get more liberal abortion legislation.

So that

the study was not done for us or from our standpoint at all,
but it shows, underlying all of the consideration that was
given in the passage of this bill in I960, which was proposed

33
actually in 196?, and was carried over, and there ware public
hearings, and so on, that underlying assumption and base and
foundation was that we are not going to destroy fatal life
except in very unusual and exceptional, extreme circumstances
The basic proposition is we don't destroy it.

And

I submit that it's up to Mary Doe to show that there is —she has to have the burden; she has the burden of showing
what the justification is, because it is a natural right
under our order of things, emanating from the Ninth Amendment
to be let alone.
fetus hasi

And that, we say, is the right which the

the right to be let alone and not to be stopped

in its growth or its birth at a time which would be premature
And despite the fact that perhaps, now as we look
at all the old authorities, perhaps when the statutes were
first passed, in our State in 1876, or 1859 in Texas,
perhaps then the original purpose was to protect the health
of the woman from aseptic surgery.
c hangs, -things are not static.

But purposes evolve and

Our Constitution is not

static.
tod we now have, as shown by the study which was
done by North Carolina, and by looking at the statute itself
4"

— we don't even have to go to the North Carolina study
but looking at the statute itself, shows that the purpose
has evolved to protect this fotus,

tod, as an illustration

of that, let me point to the vary procedure which is being

36
attacked here,, the procedure involves four doctors or six —
there is some question about whether the hospital committee
can include the two consultants? but let’s say six*

They

are not required by the statute to determine whether the
method that's used for the abortion is safe or not, or
whether the woman is too far advanced to undergo abortion.
All they are required to do under this statute is to d
whether the abortion should be performed, whether it comes
within one of the exceptions.

That's all.

They don't make a medical judgment about the
operation itself.

What they're concerned about, is this an

instance, is this an extreme instance in which we should
allow the fetus to be destroyed.

That's all.

And that shows that the purpose is the fetus * s
protection.
Look also at the exceptions, the three exceptions.
If it were that the purpose of the exceptions was any time
that it was for the woman's desire or want, it would deal
only with her own health? but the exceptions are only when
extreme circumstances of self-preservation or self-defense,
as far as sha3s concerned, not the things that have to do with
her health.

So 1 think that the statute itself shows that

the underlying purpose is the protection of fatal life.
Also, 1 think that very clearly the part that was
struck out by the court below, with respect to the action,

3?

the statutory action to be brought in a. superior court for
the child or the fetus’s underlying
rights .

constitutional or other-

That shows clearly that the legislative — the

Legislature’s purpose was to protect the fetus from being
destroyed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs We’ll terminate until

MRS. BEASLEYS

Thank you.

38

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.xn,}
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
continue.

Mrs. Beasley, you may

You have seven minutes left.
MRS. BEASLEY;

I'd like to point out, at this

juncture again, with respect to jurisdiction, that th€ right
which Mary Doe is asserting here as being protected by the
Constitution is really not the right that she asserts in her
brief, and I say that for this .reason:

She doesn't disagree

with the court below and the statute that it makes. Although
it found the basis of the statute, the purpose of the statute
to be health oriented, it said the State has some interest .
in protecting fetal life.
The State does have an interest which it can
assert by statute, and therefore, the District Court-made
statute recognised from the very beginning that there was
something protectable by the State prior to birth.
So I say that Mary Doe is beat from the beginning,
because she doesn’t come to this Court and say that the
District Court's statute is overbroad, but she only says
it's v&gua*

So that what we have here is not a question

as to whether a woman has a constitutional right to abort
any pregnancy, but whether she has them in th© terms that
the District Court outlined, that is, one -that is not
necessary in the best clinical judgment of the physician.

39
Now, 1 say that supports the State’s position,
because that’s a recognition bythe court below that there
is protectable fetal life, and that it becomes a matter of
degree how far the State can go in protecting it.

And the

District Court below said that under the Constitution the
State can only protect it if it isn’t necessary to take
the fetal life for the health of the mother, whereas the
State Legislature said, no, it’s more protectable than that,
and we’re only going to allow abortions except in the three
unusual extreme circumstances which we set out.
So the District Court was not making a judgment
based on constitutional law, but a value judgment once it
had already accepted the proposition that there was protectable
human life involved in the destruction of an unborn human
child.

So —
QUESTION:

I take it you’d have no difficulty, from

the position you’ve indicated, that you’d have no difficulty
in sustaining a statute if the Legislature proscribed one
set of standards for the first trimester or the first 140
days, and a more rigorous standard after that period?
MSS. BEASLEY: That’s right.

I think it is a matter

of degree, 1 think it’s a value judgment that is best left
in the hands of the Legislature to determine in this gray
area of pr5.or to birth,what human rights are there prior to

40
birth.
And I say this also for the reason that, under our
Constitution, we've talked a lot about the term "person", but
the term "person" is not defined in the Constitution.

And

as we said earlier, the Constitution, of course, is a. living
document.

And today we know more, medically and under science,

with respect to personhood and what occurs prior to birth,
and what the movement is and at what stage and so on, what
a person is.
1 think the State has an interest in protecting,
as far as it can, that life.

And that's illustrated by this

criminal abortion law, statute, that Georgia has in the
context of its many statutes which protect fetal life in
various forms, and the decisions of its courts over the
years, which say, time after time after time, beginning with
at least that 1349 cases

We're going to consider an unborn

child in ventre simare as being in rerum natura.
in the secular world.

That is,

Where it's in its own interest to do so.

So that it's part of Georgia's whole public policy
to protect the fetal life, which it is seeking to protect
in tliis instance.
Now, there is one other basis, I think, or at
least twos

of course it wants to protect the health of the

mother, and that’s why it allows these exceptions, at least
the exception for her own health and her own life, and the

41
rape exception,

it protects her mental health.

But there is

also the basis that the State wants to protect not only health,
as I said,, primarily it was for the protection of the fetal
life and also for the general welfare, to protect the public
ethic, as 54r. Justice Blackraun suggested, the Hippocratic
oath.
The State has an obligation to uphold the general
welfare, which includes how government protects the
individuals that live in it.

And I would suggest that this

is an emanation of that, or manifestation of that obligation
on government, because the natural right which an unborn
fetus has to continued existence without being disturbed,
its right to be let alone, which is recognised in natural
law, and has

been recognised in the common law under Blackstone

and Cobb, and those authorities, which were accepted, by the
way, by the Georgia courts*

They didn’t have all the

cases, necessarily, from England, but they relied on Blackstone
and Cobb,as shown in the decision which they rendered.
So it was regarded as a protectable right at the
vary beginning of our State's existence.
I think this is a particularly critical area whore,
what Mr* Justice Powell said in Chadwick vs. Tampa recently,
it’s very important.

He said:

That our federal system

warns of converting desirable practices into constitutional
loiamahdments

42
And 1 think that's what is being asked for here.
J think that's what Mary Doe is asking for# for her desire,
or a desirable practice, getting into all the health
significances of infant mortality or maternal mortality?
that may be desirable, but let's not turn it into a
constitutional commandment, because it isn't there.
If there's anything emanating from the Ninth
Amendment, it's the fetus's right to be left alone, and his
own self-preservation which is the ultimate responsibility
of government to protect.
QUESTION: Are yen saying that even if the fetus is
not — whether the fetus is or is not a person under the
Fourteenth Amendment, that there is a right of the fetus to
be- let alone, and it must be balanced with all the other
factors involved?
MBS. BEASLEY;
right.

Yes, indeed.

I think there is that

Pius other rights, or other interests which the State

has, to see that it is let alone from undue destruction.
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that the potential

mother, the woman, is without rights?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Not at all.

Not at all.

Of course

she has rights, too, to her own privacy, but here another
entity becomes involved.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beasley, I take it that the State,

43
in making its determination as to what sort of a statute it
will enact and what rights it will support * need not choose
only from those guaranteed by the federal Constitution?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Oh, that is correct, because it has

powers of — under its police powers, to pass statutes to
protect other interests, which aren’t necessarily
constitutional rights.

I don’t think you necessarily are

balancing two constitutional rights here at all.

And

certainly, despite what Mrs. Weddington said, there are
constitutional rights abridged by compelling State interests
which are other than the protection of other constitutional
rights in many regards, public welfare type of things, or
health.
It may not be a constitutional right to health in
that instance.
Thank you.

mentioned.

I have had same
QUESTION:

In that connection, Mrs. Hames, I don't

44
recall that X found it mentioned in your brief, either.
And perhaps you'll tell rue why it wasn't even footnoted.
MRS. BAMSS:

I do not consider it medically relevant,

amiti understand that medical schools are not now using it,
and that the oath also forbids the treatment of kidney stones,
a nd so that is an example of its relevance to today.
QUESTION; Where do yon get the authority to say that
medical schools are hot now using it?
MRS. NAMES:

Based on personal experience within the

medical schools, in lectures on ethics in abortion.
QUESTION:

Would it surprise you if some are

using it?
MSS. HAMESs

I don't doubt that some might still be

using it, but I think it was an oath that was of its time, and
that the prohibition against treatment for kidney stones
indicates that also.
QUESTIONs

Well, maybe the answer to that is that

kidney stone treatment is certainly different than it was
four hundred years

B.c.

But you must concede that it goes directly to the
point, doesn’t it?
”1 will give no deadly medicine to anyone that
asks"

it ties it in with suicide — "nor suggest any such

counsel, and in like manner I will not give to a woman a
pessary to produca abortion.**

45
Or# in another translation;

"Nor will I make a

suggestion to this effect, similarly l will not give to a
woman an abortive remedy."
Now# this is the definite statement of medical
ethics for centuries, and yet in neither brief, on either side
of the case, is there any reference to it.
MRS. HftMESs

1 believe the brief filed on behalf of

the OB-GYN doctors does go into it, I’m net sure.
very extensive brief.

It’s a

But 1 think that your comments indicate

the lack of relevance to it today# too# because the treatment
for abortion is quite different today than what it was when
that was written*

Now it's about a fifteen-minute procedure#

with the suction device.

So that the treatment — if you

say that the treatment for kidney stones is different today#
then I would answer that the treatment for abortion is also
different today.
QUESTION* But of course the oath was formulated at
a time when abortion was prevalent and widely practiced#
historically*
HRS* GAMES:

It was not a very safe procedure then#

either.
Further# to just kind of summarise some of the
other things that have come up# the State# in its supplemental
authorities# did refer to this legislative study, and X would
like to point out some information in there.

I think that

46

that study shows that it’s the interest of the woman and not
the fetus involved.
I would also like, to point out information in there
that's not contained anywhere else, and that is that there
were about 60 or 70 abortions performed in Georgia during the
German measles epidemic in 564 and *65, and that did place
a lot of doctors in jeopardy»

tod I think that they are new

compelling reasons, be they socio or economic reasons, just
as valid for performing an abortion.
