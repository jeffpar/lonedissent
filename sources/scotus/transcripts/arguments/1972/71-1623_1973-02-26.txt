MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 71-1623, Bullock against Weiser.
Mr. Black, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES L. BLACK, JR., ESQ. f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BLACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it not unfitting to state in court in
the beginning, that having had the benefit of his wise
counsel, I now have the benefit of the physical presence of
the Honorable John L. Hill, Attorney General of Texas, who
is in attendance in court today and at the table with me
because of the transcendent importance to the state and to
its political structure of -this case.
The case involves the constitutional validity of
Senate Bill 1, passed by the Texas legislature in 1971, and
signed into law by the Governor in June of that year,
redistricting the State of Connecticut into 24 new
congressional districts in consequence of the April 1, 1970
census, as against the objection of a violation of Article I,
Section 2, because of certain population discrepancies amongst
the districts.
These discrepancies may be described as follows.
The average percentage discrepancy amongst all districts is

4
»745 perceri’.:»

The highest variation is 2»43 percent up, and

the lowest 1.70 percent down, making a total spread of
approximate.ly 4.1 percent and placing the smallest and the
largest district in a ratio of some 1 to 1.04.
Appellees filed their complaint in October, .1971,
assailing this plan as unconstitutional and tendering to the
Court as one of the remedial possibilities a Plan B, which
differed from Senate Bill 1, the state’s plan, only in that
county lines—substantially only in that county lines were
freely cut, some 18 more county lines cut, and virtually
a aero population variation thereby attained, while the
general plan of the legislature's bill was followed.
Evidence in the cause was taken by deposition, and
it showed the following.

First,

it

conspicuously and

pervasively showed a deep concern of the state legislators
in the maintenance of present congressional districts—that
is to say, prior congressional districts—in something like
their same form, in the preservation cf the seniority
accrued to the Texas congressional delegation, and in other
such concerns later to this, which may be called by the
pejorative term of incumbency protection, which we, takingaccount of both parties to the relation, prefer to designate
as protection of the constituency-congressman relationship.
Thera is uncontradicted, unimpeached and affirmative
evidence in the record that this concern in its inception and

5

in its implementation had no partisan or- ideological bias
and there is no showing in the record, as we read it, of any
causal connection between this concern and any of the
variations in the plan, small as they are, or the whole set
of them.
During the passage of Senate Bill 1, the plan we
are defending,through the state legislature, another bill
was originated in and passed the Texas House of Representativ
which showed variations of 2.5 percent up and down, or 1*6
percent lower than those in the bill which finally passed
and which lira are defending.
There is nothing in this record, at least, as to
the average deviations in that bill.
the

There is evidence that

motives for the defeat of this bill in conference

committee were various and only partly known, but it is fair
to say that they undoubtedly had to do in'some substantial
part with contesting congressional aspirations of a House
member and a Senate member.
The record shows that certain of the legislators
had a belief that they were operating under certain
percentage leeways, that a certain tolerance was afforded to
them by the constitutional lav? of the subject,

Whether that

belief v?as right will, of course, depend on the outcome of
this case.
There is shown by the record an unirapeachediy

6
bona fide concern with the preservation of county lines.
The best evidence for this concern and for its bona fides
is ei map of the plan as it emerged, which we have thoroughly
analyzed in our reply brief.
Finally, there is not a scintilla of evidence
that we can find in this plan that we are defending of any
bias toward any section, toward any type of sectional
.interest, toward any rural or city interest, industrial or
labor interest, or anything of the sort»

With respect to

interests, so far as we can tell, it is completely random
and nothing of this sort has been brought forward.
On January 10th, the appellees herein filed an
amended complaint in which, in addition to Plan B, they
tendered to the Court as another alternative for remedy a
Plan C, which this time departed very widely indeed from the
legislature's plan and rather radically in some respects
redistricted the state.
On January 21st, 11 days later, a trial was held
which actually by agreement consisted only of arguments,
since all the evidence had been taken by deposition, and at
that trial appellees’ counsel six times recommended the
adoption of their Plan B, the one which followed the
legislative intent as closely as possible, while reducing
variations to virtually zero, and Plan C was never mentioned
by anyone except one judge in the course of a rather

garrulous .enumeration of all the plans before the court.
The next morning,

January 22, 1972, at 11:00 o'clock in the

morning, the court reconvened,in a very short opinion
knocked out the legislature's plan for districting, and
announced that Plan C, the radically revised plan, was to
be, and 1 quote, "the plan of this court for the congressiona
districts

of the State of Texas."
The court left open the possibility of a stay—I

beg the Court's pardon, of an action, a new action by the
legislature.

But the Governor refused to call a special

session; so, that possibility was not a real one.

This

Court stayed this judgment on an application to hr. Justice
Powell by him referring to the Court at about the end of
January, 1972.

And the elections last year were held under

the state’s pian.
Q

May 1 ask you, Mr. Black, was it held under

S.B.l?
MR. BLACKs
Q

Not under the preceding system?

MR. BLACK;
stayed.

Under S.B.l, yes, Your Honor.

No.

The judgment was being wholly

There was no injunction against S.B.l? it was

therefore used by the secretary of state, who is the
appellant herein.
Q
under S.B.l.

So, the present state legislature was elected

8
MR» BLACK:

The present state congressional

delegation.
Q

I beg your pardon.

MR. BLACK:

Yes.

Yes.

There was an intervention on the

plaintiffs' side, on the appellees’ side, by the chairman
of Bexar County Republican Committee and others, and they
have filed a brief herein as appellees-intervenors.

But it

is believed that neither the intervention nor the position
here add anything significantly one way or another to the
issues of this case.
May it please the Court, the condemnation of so
tight-fitting a plan as this, with variations up and down
of 4.1 percent, must rest, if it is to be pronounced, on
the strictest rule associated with the case of Kirkpatrick v.
Preisler, the rule of very strict arithmetical equality as
to congressional districting.
We have other contentions which X will urge, but
our contention in chief here to this Court is that we ask
that this Court recede generally from a rule attributing
constitutional significance to variations of the magnitude
that are found in this case, any constitutional significance
at all.
We have to start, of course, with the recognition
that Mahan v. Howell seems to put our question in a somewhat
different frame of reference today, the frame of reference

9
being that it would, seem a distinction between the Equal
Protection Clause and the inferential rule drawn by
analogy of functional equivalency from Article I, Section 2.
But this frame of reference may easily be more misleading
than helpful as to this question, because the principal
question actually is still just the same.
The constitutional law of congressional districting
has to march on its own feet.

If there had never been a

state legislative districting or apportionment case, if
there were no Equal Protection Clause, if there were no
14th Amendment, the dominant question in this case, the one
principally interesting in this Court, would still be, Can
it rationally be held by analogic or functional inference
from Article I, Section 2, that the substantive
constitutional law of congressional districting contains a
requirement of exact arithmetic equality of district
populations or can this be held by any other lawfully
warrantable process of reason?
The right answer to this question-Q

Can you find anything in there that

indicates that any degree of inexactitude would be against
the Constitution?
MR. BLACK:

I think it is fair to infer analogically

or as a matter of functional equivalency from a plan which
aims at a rough and substantial proportionality of

10
representatives to constituencies, that the roots which
make up-Q

If within the state one district was five

times as large as another—say there was a state with two
districts in it and one congressional district was five times
as large as the other.

You would say that would violate

that provision in the Constitution?
MR. BLACK:

Article I, Section 2.

Your Honor,

that would be relatively easy, I think, because there is no
variation amongst the states which is anything like that
great.

The real difficulty is reached when one finds such

variations in ideal districts as well as between some of the
states at the extreme of the ideal district table, which
never varied by more than 200,000 or so.

And at that point

my answer would be that there' is no mechanical character
in this inference, that the. federal plan aims at
substantial equality and that the state congressional
delegation ought to be apportioned by analysis—
«

Q

You say a state ought to be free to vary by

as much as the Constitution permits states to vary among
themselves?
MR. BLACK:

Mo, Your Honor, that is the meaning of

my statement, as I see it, that I don't think this is a
mechanical inference which carries over the. exact
arithmetical characteristics.

I think it is the nature of

11
the federal plan as a plan aiming not at total—not at
•exactly forming but at substantial and reasonable equality
that must form the first term and an analogic inference to
any rule having to do with the formation of a state's
congressional delegation.

What is substantially reasonable

may be a different matter within a state from what it is
on the national sphere.
But at the other end of the scale, there is
simply no warrant whatever for the use of the federal
scheme permitting without feeling of wrong or apology the
variations which it does as the first term in an analogy
which terminates in the judgment that zero variation is
somehow the rule in state delegations.
We have to recognize, of course, realistically at
this time and at this hour that there are certain
expressions,and certain strong expressions, in tha recently
decided case of Mahan v_._ Howell which seem to assume
vitality, or continuing vitality, in the Kirkpatrick rule
as applied to congressional districts.
But it is never too late for the right answer, and
it is appellant’s submission herein that the answer in the
negative to the question whether this inference of
substantive law is warrantable i3 overwhelmingly the right
answer for two reasons, which I will canvass though either
one is sufficient alone.

And I would urge upon the Court

12
that there never will fce a better case than this for the
total new look and total reconsideration of the Kirkpatrick
rule of exact arithmetical exactness.
First, because in this case from every practical
point of view, the variations are trivial, 4.1 percent up
and down„
Secondly, there is a total lack of any evidence or
any suggestion of any kind of bias in this case toward any
sort of political or sectional or economic interest.
And, finally, because there is an absolutely clean,
unimpeachably clean, approach to the county line question,
to the question of the integrity of counties.
In my answer to Mr. Justice White, I have really
in a sense broken into the first of our points, which is
simply that in

brief--■‘though these matters are better

canvassed, arithmetical as they are, in writing and in
extension, we have tried to do that in our brief-—but in
sum, there is nothing in Article I, Section 2, or an
inference which can be drawn therefrom, which leads the
mind rationally to a requirement of exact arithmetic
equality.
It is well, I think, to look—first,'to round the
picture out, I will say what our second point will be and it
is just simply that there are easily accessible data, mere
arithmetical facts, which it were pretentious to refer to as

\
13
demographic, which put it entirely out of doubt, that there
is no firm correlation whatever for multiple reasons at
the low percentage range between very small variations in
population as of census day and the voting power of people
who either do vote or can vote at the times and places when
they do vote which, 1 will remind the Court, commence two
and one half years after the census day of April 1st in the
sere numbered—
Q

1 am surprised that you would re ad Mahan

as being a reaffirmation of Kirkpatrick.

I would have taken

it that no party in Malian had any occasion to challenge
Kirkpatrick and therefore there was no occasion to deal with
it other than as datum.
MR. BLACK:

Your Honor, of course that is correct

and perhaps I have been guilty of an advocate pessimism,
but there did seem to us to be expressions which at least
I assumed that Kirkpatrick was for the moment being taken
as a fixed star and that the part of wisdom for us, therefore,
is directly to address ourselves to that point.

Of course,

it is very true, as Your Honor says, that there was nothing
at issue in Mahan that concerned continuing validity of the
rule in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler.
The relevance of the last point to substantive
law, the relevance of this lack of correlation with
substantive law,is very simple and thoroughly pervading of

14
the whole legal framework.

Good' lav/ never commands a

futility? and when it discovers that it has commanded a
futility by inadvertence, it hastens to retract it.
We think that it can be shown by these simple
arithmetical means that the command of exact arithmetical
equality is a futility, that it effects nothing, that it has
no connection of any kind with the power to vote at the times
and places when people actually do vote.
If 1 may develop these points just a little more
deeply, let me revert, as one does revert at those times,
to the question of the intent of those who put into place
Article 1, Section 2.

Again, this is a matter much better

canvassed in writing and with extensive references.

But 1

think that we happen to be furnished by history with a
single incident which, if unrebutted— and it is not rebutted—»
is absolutely conclusive as to what the framers of the
Constitution would have thought of a case of this kind.
When the first apportionment, interim apportionment in
Article X, Section 2, was constructed by a committee in the
Constitutional Convention, that committee had before it the
best population estimates which the

art

of demography, not

yet so baptized, made available to it at the time.

The

committee came back to the. whole convention with a plan
which substantially respected the population figures but
did so only substantially and departed from what they would

15
have indicated considerably more widely than anything in
this case or in any case remotely like it»
Every attempt to change this report was
perfunctorily defeated on the floor of the convention.

And

at last a motion was made to ask the committee to state its
reasons.

Whereupon, these practical men, who realized that

such reasons are multiple, that they differ amongst the
different constituents of the districting body or the
apportioning body, that they may be only partly
articulable, proceeded to defeat this motion ten to one.
We have asked in our brief—and I ask again with respect-Is it so much as possible that the people who did this
would have considered the variations in this case, 4.1 percent
up and down, as violative of the Constitution they were
then building, of the article they were then writing, of
the very section they were at that moment drafting?
There is nothing in the record in Farrand or
elsewhere to rebut this inference.
I think the question of the analogy with the
federal plan has already been dealt with in my response to
Mr. Justice White's question, and I would simply say,
finally, on this point that there is nothing in the
derivation of the congressional districting rule, nothing
in its working, nothing in its history, to make it more
enact than the state legislative rule.

16
In £ act , the connection here with Mahan, y. Howell
is simply that since there is nothing in Article I, Section
2, or anything inferable from Article I, Section 2, or from
its history or from its working through history that could
support a stricter rule than the rule under the vague
mandate of the Equal Protection Clause, Mahan v. Howell in
its holding at least, ought to afford very strong collateral
support to us, though indirect, at this stage, because if
these rules are the same in the texture with which they end
up at the end of their derivation, the rules, namely, of
the Equal Protection Clause and the rule derived only by
functional analogy from Article I, Section 2, and from
nowhere else, if these things are the same, then if there
was room for the accommodation of pragmatic factors in
Mahan v. Howell, surely there should be room for
accommodation to pragmatic factors in a congressional case»
I would only remind the Court 'that the tolerance
that we ask for in this case is exactly, as it happens, four
times less, one-fourth as much as that that was granted in
Mahan v, Howell»
I would ask the Court8s indulgence for a very small
amount of arithmetic at this time and then completely
conclxxde on this point.

The cases—-this is a bit of a

filling out of my assertion it is a futility to command
this degree of exactness—-the cases have insisted on

17
dilution of the vote as a rationale for the apportion of
cases.

Wesberry v. Sanders, the leading congressional case,

is utterly saturated with this concept; in line after line,
paragraph after paragraph it occurs.
Shat are the facts of the correlation between the
raw body count on April 1, 1970 and the power of the vote
in congressional districts in the ensuing 12 1/2 years,
-

beginning 2 1/2 years later and ending 12 1/2 years later?
-

-

I pass over briefly the census count problem with
Blacks and minorities, the minor problems such as aliens,
students, prisoners, and so on, and come to the three great
strategic factors which totally defeat this correlation.
First is the surprisingly wide variance in the percentage of
age-eligibiles to vote as amongst the congressional
districts in virtually every state in the union.
The second is the very wide difference in growth
patterns in the congressional districts in any large state
in the union or even any middle size state in the union.
And finally and as a clincher, the unpredictability
agreed upon by all authorities in the present state of the
art of deruogi’aphy of these growth patterns.

When one

remembers that these things operate sequentially over a
period of 12-1/2 years on raw body count, as an indicator of
voting power, and when one remembers that the projection or
the sub-national post-census projection, as they call it,

18

which one would be asking of the demographers has to do not
only with people who are 13 in 1970 but with people who are
eight in 1970, and it asks them to say how many people 18
years old, how many citizens as opposed to aliens, how
many non-prisoners as opposed to prisoners, there will be in
a district.

The position becomes quite hopeless, and 1 think

we have to stop and ask at this point what it is that these
cases are doing.

Is it something symbolic or is it

something that has to do really and truly with the power of
the vote?
It is our submission that if the latter is the
case,

and it must surely be the case, then this arithmetic

which may have a trivial sound--figures often do sound
trivial—is utterly and deadly serious and that these
problems have to be faced before another case is decided,
with respect and deference, in which the raw census count is
treated as though it really did accurately indicate the
power of the vote.
As to the age-eligible population, let me give
Your Honors an example—well, I will give you the whole
Texas range.

Texas districts differing by about four percent

in raw population have age-eligible populations from 324,000
to 264,000, with no correlation whatever to speak of with the
raw population.
We have done a table that ranges the districts in

19
order of raw population an of April 1, 1970, and I will
just, give the Court the first five—the first five, the
first largest, second largest, third largest, and so on,
districts.

We then range them in order of age-eligible

populations.

The numbers in the different districts, 1, 2,

3. 4, 5, are as follows:
297,000.

313,000, 286,000, 295,000, 325,000,

But the message is made a little more intelligible

if I give the Court the order numbers.
These districts respectively stand in the
following order, ana remember that they are in the order
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in population.

The third, the twentieth, the

eighteenth, the first, and the sixteenth.
district names.

Those are not

Those are numbers in which the first five

districts in population stand whan they are arranged in an
order of age-eligible population.
The rest of the table for Texas shows the same
thing, and similar tables show much the same thing from other
states.
The growth-pattern problem speaks for itself,
when one considers that v/hafc one is dealing with is growth
patterns of 12-1/2 years projection, of growth patterns
applied to 18 year olds and up and to all these other factors,
and I do not think it is really necessary, once attention is
drawn to it, to say very much more about that.
simply conclude—

I would

20
Q

I do not know that inaccurate census figures

is much of a justification for varying from absolute
equality based on the census figures, as inaccurate as they
are.

Let us assume that they were inaccurate, either ten

percent high

cr ten percent low»

MR. BLACK:

With the deepest respect, Mr. Justice

White, it is not upon the inaccuracy of the census figures
that we principally rely.

It is, as we have said in our

brief, a probably existing but relatively minor factor
Q

It is not much of an argument for justifying

the variations.
MR. BLACK:
it is not ours.
Q

No, not very much.

It would not be, and

Our principal arguments are—
Or even growth patterns is not much of a

justification.
MR. BLACK:

Growth, I should respectfully differ.

When one considers that growth patterns are up—
Q

What if it is growth down, like a lot of

places are?
MR. BLACK:

In Texas one has growth both up and

down.
Q

That is right, that is right.

MR. BLACK:

So, when one superimposes these growth

patterns only in part predictable on the age-eligible
population, one finds simply that one might arbitrarily

21
select census population, though with respect I should not
see why that would be done; but one cannot select it with
any warrantable hope that it has anything to do with the
power of the vote at the times when people actually do vote,
because of the lack of correlation with eligibility to vote,
because of the large and unpredictable character of the
growth patterns„
Q

How far would you go, Mr. Black, in allowing

a variation?

Would you go 20 percent or 50 percent or 100

percent?
MR. BLACK;

With respect, Your Honor, 1 do not

think that question is- susceptible of a categorical answer.
1 think it would take more study than a single case ever
affords.
What I should say confidently in this case is that
we are a very long way below the point at which any
significance as to voting power can be attributed to the
variations in population which are shown.
I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Black.

Mr. Fischman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE FISCHMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FISCHMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

22
I will address myself, if the Court please, to the
first of the appellant's arguments; that is, whether the
rule laid down in Kirkpatrick v, Preisler should be
retreated from.

Secondly, I would address myself to

whether, if that not be the case, the record in this case
brings a case before the Court that falls within the
Kirkpatrick rule.

And, thirdly, I will say a word about the

remedy which was fashioned by the court below and which is
in issue here today.
The grounds urged by appellant, may it please the
Court, in support of its position that Kirkpatrick ought to
be retreated from are fourfold.

First, that Kirkpatrick

is not supported by the cases relied on in that decision.
Kirkpatrick, as I recall, cited Wes berry v> S cinders and
Reynolds v. Sims.

These cases, Wesberry of course being

the first congressional case in this recent line and
Reynolds being the major, if we may use that term with
respect to any one case, decision with respect to legislative,
from those cases was fashioned a rule enunciated in
Kirkpatrick.

We think that the state must make a good

faith effort, the emphasis being on the effort, to achieve
absolute equality, not that equality be achieved.

If the

recent Mahan decision stands for anything, I think it is
possibly a reaffirmation of that principle, and we certainly
do not rely on that decision .since it was not a congressional

23
casa.
But, as we sea it, the plain wording of the
Constitution requires that people of the state elect the
members of the United States House of Representatives, not
the Texas legislature»

If it were the intention of the

framers of the Constitution to permit legislatures to
elect the representatives, certainly they could have done
so as they did in the case of United States Senators»

The

cleavage between the two houses, the great compromise, is
very clearly articulated in the Wesberry opinion.
But the point that we wish to emphasize is this.
We are here today because the State of Texas did not make
a good faith effort to achieve absolute equality, not so
much that equality was not achieved.
The second reasons advanced by the appellant are
that—X believe they refer to the Kirkpatrick decision as
a Draconian rule or a Proustian rule and suggest that it is
a rule of absolutism.

I think this is an incorrect reading»

They ask the Court to make allowance for reasonable
legislative interplay.

This proposition was, of course,

expressly rejected in Kirkpatrick, we suggest, on very sound
reasons.

It leaves the door open, first of all, to

gerrymandering under whatever reason that the legislature
might have.
And, most importantly, may it please the Court, is

24
that this proposition presumes that the legislature is
unable to act in good faith.

We submit that the function of

the legislature in congressional r©districting cases is to
act impartially, to apportion the congressional seats among
the population, considering only factors of population and
nothing else.
We are willing to say that the legislature can
make that good faith effort, and we feel that to presume
otherwise is not only a gratuitous insult to the legislature
but to the people that elect them as well.
I think a moment's time should be devoted to the

argument that, because census data is inaccurate it cannot
be that the Constitution requires a good faith effort to
achieve absolute equality.
Q

Your argument seems to be perhaps suggesting

a variation of tests here, Mr. Fischman, if l understood you
correctly.

I got the impression you were telling us that

you do not fault Texas so much for a bad result as you do
for not trying hard enough.
at any event.

That is the way I read you,

That means that a review in Court must get

into motives primarily rather than results.
MR. FISCHMAN:

I think

not in the classical

sense of trying to divine intent, for example in a criminal
cases I do not think and have never suggested, Mr. Chief
Justice, that the. legislature of the State of Texas has set

out with bad faith, intent, to deprive the people of the
State of Texas or a certain portion thereof of the full
weight of their vote in electing congressional representatives.
When we talk about intent, we must consider in the
case at bar the justifications that the state relies on,.
did we get a bill with a 4.1 deviation top to bottom?
got it for two reasons primarily.

How

We

Number one,- the desire to

preserve incumbents.
I submit to the Court that if this is a legitimate
consideration, then the Court, should and expressly say so
and would necessarily reverse this case.
Q

What if it is simply a neutral consideration?

What if it is a consideration that the Court might decide
it is simply no business of this Court?

It is not an

invidious, or it is not an impermissible or illegitimate
consideration, but it is not one maybe that we should say
necessarily legitimately justifies any further deviation
than might otherwise exist.
tlR» FISCHMAN:

What if it is simply neutral?

I do not think it can ever be

neutral.
Q

Why could it not be?

It is just no business

of this Court; neutral from that point of view.
In other words, we could all agree, everybody
would agree, that if there were evidence here of racial
discrimination, we would all agree that that is wholly

26
illegitimate for other constitutional- reasons»

But if it

were this incumbency preservation., constituency preservation,
what zf the Court should just decide that is no business of
ours and therefore a neutral factor?
realm of possibility?

Is that not within the

Certainly it could be neutral from

the point of view of the Constitution, could it not be?
MR. FISCHMAN:

Not if the decision of the Court in

Kirkpatrick is fco stay in.

We think that this is an element

of the equation in determining a good faith effort.
Q

This factor, this ingredient, was not in

Kirkpatrick, was it?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

No—

One way or the other.

MR. FISCHMAN:

•—-it was not.

It has been before

the Court twice in K1ahr v. Wi11isms and in Taylor v.
McKiffin, but in neither case did the Court reach those
questions.

They were there on procedural matters.
The district courts, I might add, in both of those

cases squarely rejected this consideration and we think on
extremely legitimate grounds.
Q

No congressman—

What is there in the Constitution that

prevents a legislature to consider this so long as it
otherwise meats the test of Article I, Section 2?

What is

there that makes this an illegitimate consideration?
MR. FISCHMAN':

Mr. Justice, members'of the United

27
States House of Represenatives are to be elected by the
people and not by the legislatures.
0

But the legislature devised this plan of

congressional districting, and that is what I am talking
about.

What is there in the United States Constitution, in

any provision, Article I, Section 2, or anywhere else, that
prevents a state legislature, in providing the congressional
districts for the state, to give consideration to the
preservation of incumbents so long as it does not otherwise
violate Article 1, Section 2?

What is it that makes this

an illegitimate consideration constitutionally.
MR. FISCHMAN:

I cannot follow the premise, because

I am not prepared to say that consideration of preserving
incumbents is not otherwise violative of Article X,
Section 2.

it is our reading of Article X, Section 2, which

we think is consistent with Wesherry, that “by the people"
means by the people.

This is the whole basis for the

language, if we are to take the opinion in Wesberrv as
being authoritative on the constitutional history that led
to this.
The great compromise was that in one branch of the
United States legislature the states x*ere to be represented,
and in the other the people.
X can give.

This is the only answer that

There is no express wording, of course, that

preservation of incumbents is prohibited.

But we think that

28
it flies in the teeth of the great compromise in Article I,
Section 2, for the legislature—
Q

Are you suggesting that this motivation to

preserve incumbency, is itself violative of something in the
Constitution?
MR. FISCIIMAN:

Insofar as it negates the good

faith effort that we believe Article I, Section 2, requires.
We believe that Article I, Section 2, requires there be no
consideration, other than population, as overlaid by
demographics.
Q

We think that Kirkpatrick left open-Even though you had. computerised perfect

equality, at least so far as any figures you could use as
a bench mark had it, and yet if you could show racial
discrimination it could still be a highly unconstitutional
scheme of congressional districting, could -it not?
MR, FISCIIMAN:

Yes, it could under the 14th

Amendment,
Q

Right.

And .is it your claim that if you had

perfect numerical proportionality, so far as any bench
marks you could find, that this would be a suspect scheme
if you could show that it was motivated by a desire to
protect incumbents?
MR. FISCHMAN:
not think I can.

I wish I could, say that, but I do

It is our belief that where the desire to

protect incumbents subordinates legitimate considerations of

29
population, then it risas to the magnitude of constitutional
violation—
Q

Then you say it is not a justification for

any variation between districts?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

We believe not.

It just is not a good enough reason to vary

from equality?
MR. FISCHMAN:
to support it*.
Q

I cannot think of any justification

No congressman-—
Can you say the same thing about following

county lines or local subdivision lines?
MR. FISCHMAN".
Q

No,- I do not,

Will that justify some variation?

MR. FISCHMAN:

I am inclined to say not in a

congressional case.
Q

Which one cut the most lines in this case.

Plan B or C?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

I believe.

Yes, sir.

And C was adopted by the court?

MR. FISCHMAN;
Q

,

Plan B cut more county lines than C did?

MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

Plan B

Yes, sir.

And C had more variation than Plan B, did it

not?
MR. FISCHMAN:

It was approximately three times as

30

great, if the amount involved is significant.
Q

Plan, B.—*

What was the justification for that, for

Plan C' varying more than Plan B did?

Was it the desire to

follow county lines?
MR. FISCHMAN:

We have nothing in the court2 s

opinion other than the statement that Plan C most closely
effectuates the principle of one man, one vote.

We do not

know and I would not presume to speculate on why Plan C was
adopted.
Q

There just was not any evidence about it,

no explanation of why Plan C rather than B was adopted,
even if you were going to through out the legislative plan?
MR. FISCHMAN:
opinion.

There was nothing in the court's

The plan was before the court for some period of

time.

There is some pleading, of course, to support the

plan.

But the Court had eompax-ison of all three plans

both in maps and statistics*—
Q

Which one followed the incumbency lines?

Which one preserved the most incumbents?
MR. FISCHMAN;

That would be the plan that the

Court declared unconstitutional, S.3.1.
Q

How about between Plan, B and C?

MR. FISCHMAN;

Plan B, there is no evidence in

the record—Q

Your clients drafted both B and C, did they

31
not?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

That is correct.

So, you ought to know which one did what to

incun* eats.
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

In all candor, 1 clo not.

So, you really were neutral?

MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

Yes, I was.

Is it not true that Plan B more closely

resembled in shape and form S.B.l than Plan C did?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

And yet it had less variance than Plan C on

a population basis?
MR. FISCHMAN:
Q

It did.

How can you defend Plan C here over and

above your own Plan B?
MR. FISCHMAN:
the court imposed.

Only on the basis that this is what

I think the only difference was that

Plan C was represented to the court to be based solely on
population and no other factor.

At one time in their

pleadings to this effect, there was discussion about
I

considering social and cultural and economic ties, community
of interest and this sort of thing.
This was some of the discussion that appears in the
record among the legislators that were concerned with
drafting the bill.

Plan C took none of these, at least we

32
have so represented, into account, and it is based solely
on population.

There was no, as I understand it, regard for

county lines or at most a minimal regard.
population.

The sole test was

And if 1 had to speculate on what the court

below thought, I would suggest that -this is probably the
/

basic reason that

Plan C

was adopted.

1 do wish to emphasize, I think appropriately at
this point, that Plan C was adopted by the court condition­
ally.

The way it was left wide open for the legislature to

hold a special session—the legislature, in point of fact,
is in session at this time, approximately one-third of the
legislative session is over.

So far not a word about a

congressional redistricting bill.
Whatever arguments there may be for the fact that
the Governor did not call a special session, there are none
now.

The legislature is free to adopt any plan, including

Plan B.
Q

Mr. Fischman, X gather under your view you

would reject the following of county lines and you would
reject protection of incumbency as justification for
population deviation.

Bo you concede that there are any

justifications other than those for population disparity
in congressional districting?
MR. FISCHMANi

1 do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

are demographic arguments only.

They

I think it is certainly

33
legitimate for the legislature to consider documented or
at best that the science of demography can document patterns
of growth or decline in population«

I think it would be a

borderline situation to consider voting population»

But

certainly allowances for demographics as suggested in
Kirkpatrick are certainly valid considerations.

But they

are neutral so long as they done in a systematic way, based
on as reliable a data as is available, and not with the
intention of discriminating and not as an after-thought to
justify what has been done for other motivations, protection
of incumbents, creating a safe seat for one of the members
of the legislature to run for Congress.

These considerations

are singularly inappropriate and any other justification
cannot be used as a cpvarup,
Q

as it were.

Mr, Fischm&n, did you prefer one plan over

the other in the court below?
MR. FISCHMAN:

Our argument, if the Court please,

was we did emphasise that Plan B should be adopted.

I would

say in defense-—
Q

Why did you submit another one?

You

submitted C after you submitted B as an amendment to your
complaint, did you not?
MR. FISCHMAN:

We filed an amended complaint

offering both Plans B and C.

I cannot answer that question,

Mr. Justice, inside the record.

But outside the record 1

34
thought it would be appropriate not only to have a plan
with population disparity ironed out, as 'Plan B, and to
follow as closely as possible what the legislature had done,
but I also thought that we ought to tear everything up and
start from scratch, and I have to admit to being the
eminence greezay [phonetic] behind
not appear in the record,,

Plan C, but this does

But as far as the effect

politically, I have to say in complete candor before this
Court I have no idea,
I would like to discuss for a moment what
alternatives there are in the consideration of what the
appropriate constitutional test is.

The appellant suggests

that perhaps some sort of leeway ought to be allowed.

They

do not argue that it ought to be the same leeway percentage­
wise as between states.

This notion, of course, was

expressly rejected in Kirkpatrick.
The reasons set forth in Kirkpatrick
much better answer that, argument than I can.

I think
We have seen

a very practical result of this allowance of a toleration.
This is what the legislature aimed for.

We have testimony

among the people that were the moving forces behind 'these
bills that they were allowed a toleration of between four
and ten percent.

And as long as they got. within, some said

four percent, some said within ten percent, everything would
be all right.

As one of the witnesses put it, their desire was
to protect the incumbents and then make it fit the numbers
within five percent.

This is precisely the vice that the

Court foresaw in Kirkpatrick and a very cogent reason for
not adopting any sort of de minimis standard by whatever
name you call it.

It is no more than a de minimis standard

to allow this sort of toleration.
absolute equality.

The goal should be

It does not have to be reached if there

is good reason for it not to have been.

This is all the

Constitution requires, in our view.
Q

And these other reasons, you claim, can be

only a demographic reason, i.e., an estimate, a valid,
rational, supportable estimate of growth in a district or
loss of population in a district?
MR. FISCHMAN:

That is our view, Mr. Justice.

1

think, confined to the record in this case, it might be
better to say our view is a negative one of what a good
faith effort is not.

It is not preservation

of incumbents;

it is not snarling up the legislature into a special session
till you deicde whether Senator Wilson will occupy
Congressman Dowdy's to be vacant seat or whether
Representative Haines will have that privilege.
is what the final map was a product of.

And this

And -the reason—and

this i3 well supported in the record—that the lower bill
adopted by the House twice and sent to the conference

36

committee or sent to the Senate—it ended up in the
conference committee—-was not adopted, because in that
bill the horae county of Senator Wilson, Angelina County,
was excluded from the second district and Representative
Haines' horae county was in it; the final bill that came out
was just the opposite way around.
And we must also consider the fact that the
shape of one district must necessarily reflect the shape
of the others.
Q

That what?

MR. FISCHMAN:

I did not get the last point.
The shape of one district must

necessarily reflect the shape of others.

And when I say

"shape," I do not mean just the geographical shape; 1 mean
the number of people.

If you have got 11 million people to

work with, you put so many in one district—
Q

You have 24 districts, right?

MR. FISCHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

These were the considerations of the legislature.
And neither—
G

What you mean by that last is that the more

districts that are above the average, the more probably that
will be below the average?
MR. FISCHMANs
Q

That is my point, Mr. Justice, yes.

All right.

MR. FISCHMAN:

1 should talk for a moment about

37
the county line argumenta

The Court# we think, in

Kirkpatrick expressly and finally rejected the argument that
preservation of county lines is a legitimate consideration
in congressional redistricting.

Appellant suggests that it

was rejected because it was a sham.

We find no such

language in the opinion of this Court.
In Mahan, recently decided, the Court held, if we
understand it, that in state legislative redistricting this
was a legitimate consideration because the county governments
were in many instances functionaries of the state.

In the

case of Virginia, there was local legislation that affected
counties only.

We find no such considerations, at least not

of such a pervasive nature, in congressional redistricting
as would allow for any substantial variations based on
preservation of county lines.
But the basic problem that we have in this case,
vrith the county line argument, is that we do riot think that
it was done on a consistent, systematic basis.

County lines

were cut, as we pointed out in our brief, where necessary—
I will retreat from the term "expedient'’—where it was
necessary to do so.

We have little Midland County, with a

population of—not Midland County, Ector County where the
city of Odessa is located, with a population of less than
100,000 people.
of Odessa

It is cut in half right through- the city

under S.B.L

38
We have .instances in Bexar County in particular
where largely rural districts intrude into Bexar County,
the 21st and the 23rd Districts.

Whereas, tinder Plan C,

I believe, Bexar County would undoubtedly be able to elect
two congressmen.
The most glaring example is in the Sixth District
which affects my home county of Dallas.

The Sixth District

runs all the way from near the Houston area, Bryan, which is
the home of Congressman Teague, northwest into the' southern
part of Dallas County, drops down and comes back around
and catches the southwestern corner of Tarrant County..
Q

Fort Worth.

MR. FISCHMAN:
large metropolitan area.

Yes, Your Honor.

Fort Worth is the

There are a number of smaller

communities there,
But in this case, this is, we submit, not the
proper case for determination of the validity of county line
arguments in congressional redistricting.
Q

How many people live in the district; do you

know offhand?
MR. FISCHMAN;

It is one of the, I believe,

slightly underpopulated districts.

I do not have that

figure in front of me.
But without the inclusion of the southern part of
Dallas County and the southwest corner of Tarrant County, it

39
would be no district at all.

And under Plan C the district

shape is radically altered to much more reflect the fact
that it is a predominantly rural district.

This is the

farm belt, cattle, crops of various kinds.

And community of

interest, if any, between the people in the southern part
of Dallas County and the people in the Bryan, Texas area, is
almost nil.
Finally, I wish to again emphasize the remedy
selected by the court was a conditional one.

No argument is

made that the court exceeded its authority, that there is no
authority for the imposition of court-ordered districting.

,

The quarrel, I believe, of the appellants in the case at bar
is that the legislative should have had an opportunity.
They have and they have always had that opportunity.
We think that this bill is manifestly unconsti­
tutional because of the lack of a good faith effort.

We

are confronted with a situation of consistent disenfranchise­
ment in every phase of government in the State of Texas.
The court was aware of this, acutely aware of it, and felt,
I am sure, that there was no alternative but to impose a
constitutional plan conditionally and give the legislature
an opportunity' to correct, what was wrong.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon the case was
submitted,]
