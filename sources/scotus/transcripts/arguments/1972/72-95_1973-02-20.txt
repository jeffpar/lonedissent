ORAL ARGUMENT OP R. JACKSON ROSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a black defendant who was
indicted in Davidson County, Tennessee in 1948 by a grand
jury which did not and had not for some years before and did
not for some years after include a member of the black race.
)

Mr. Richardson, with the advice and consent of the
retained counsel, entered a plea of guilty and accepted a
sentence of 99 years in the state penetentiary.
In 1964, Mr. Henderson first came back Into the
courts when he attacked or alleged that his confession xvas
coerced and that his guilty plea was involuntary.

The case

was ultimately heard by writ of habeas corpus in the federal
district court; the Sixth Circuit denied him relief in this
court, denied cert.
Q
that time.

There was no reference to his complaint at
Is that —

MR. ROSE:

No, YOur Honor, none.

There was

reference in the evidentiary hearing in the state court at

4
this case that he was advised at that time that he could
raise this question, advised by the attorney that represented
him at that time.
The state court granted an evidentiary hearing in
this case.
Q

And what year is this, now?

MR. ROSE:

You have moved.

Then, we have moved to 1967; the state

granted an evidentiary hearing and the proof, as I stated
earlier, showed that there had been no blacks to serve on the
grand jury from 1922 until 1953, when the first black was
put on the Davidson County Grand Jury.

The selection system

from 1947 was that the trial judges, criminal trial judges
would take the people that they wanted on the grand jury, no
random selection.
The court denied relief, the state court did.

Then,

ultimately, the Tennessee Appellate Court said that he had
waived the right by his failure to object by plea and abatement
prior to entering of plea to the indictment.
The rule in Tennessee is substantially the same as
the rule 12(B)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
He filed a petition of habeas corpus in the Federal
District Court and that court granted a relief on the basis
of the conclusion of the court that the grand jury was
void.

It therefore entered a void indictment and that he

could not have waived it because no attorney in Tennessee

5
would have thought of raising the question in 1948,

quoting

a statement from a concurring opinion in the Tennessee Court
of Criminal Appeals by Judge Galbreath.
The Sixth Circuit held that the indictment was not
void but voidable, but under the unique circumstances of this
case, in light of the fact that one of our judges had stated
"no iawywer would have thought of it," of raising this in
1948, that Mr. Henderson was entitled to the relief that it
was not a knowing, intelligent waiver.
It is our position that Mr. Henderson waived his
right to attack this twice, once, by entering a plea at all,
or before raising it and the second time, when he entered a
plea of guilty.

The first issue, of waiving it by failing to

question it prior to entering a plea to the indictment, we
follow the same line of reasoning generally, that the
government did in the preceding case.
Q

The court —

Would you say that he had any kind of a waiver

in 1964 when he sought habeas corpus release and did not
raise the claim?
MR. ROSE:

Yes, your Honor, as a matter of fact, I

filed a motion to dismiss the petition for that reason in the
district court.

I did not pursue that issue in the Sixth

Circuit Court of Appeals but at least that was ray original
position in this case.
This Court has, as has been stated here earlier

6
today, has held that where a defendant is convicted as a
result of some illegal evidence or illegal proceedings, that
went to the question or the issue of innocence or guilt, that
it must be a knowing intelligent waiver.
In this case, if I may state to the court, this is
typically what — or shall I 3ay a hypothetical situation.
Here is a retained counsel.

He has a client who is facing a

possible death penalty and he has, really, one thing in mind,
the

welfare of his client, theoretically.

Assuming that this

issue crosses, his mind, his client is in jail.

His client

has made a confession and, taking the feeling of the times in
19^8, has a pretty good chance of getting the

death penalty,

or at least a reasonable chance of getting the death penalty,
and the issue of the composition of the grand jury crosses
his mind.

He is going to arrive at the conclusion that if I

%

raise that, what will happen?

I'll be successful and there

will be blacks included on the grand jury that will consider
the reindictment of him.

But this grand jury has a confession

in front of them.
It is my position and I don't think anybody would
question the fact that in all likelihood a solid black grand
jury would have indicted him in the face of this confession.
Nov;, this would gain him additional time if he
wanted additional time but there is no speculation, really,
that could come to that conclusion in this case because he

7
has successfully negotiated a plea»
He had agreed, apparently successfully, at least
he eliminated the possibility of the death penalty.

The only

other reason that an an attorney would have considered
waiving it, or raising it at that time would be to further
the cause of civil rights on

this particular issue to attempt

to eliminate this illegal method, but it would have no effect
on his client.
Q

General Rose, under the Tennessee procedures,

at what point was it required to be raised, if it were
raised?
MR. ROSE:

Before a plea was entered to the

Indictment, whether the plea be guilty or not guilty.
Q

Any time before a plea.

MR. ROSE:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

What, even though there was a guilty plea in

this case, what does the record show?
anything, before the plea was entered?

What happened, if
You keep talking about

negotiations on the deal and so on.
MR. ROSE:
Q

You just assume what the record shows.

MR. ROSE:
Honor.

Just that there was a —

Maybe the record does not show, your

I'm not sure at this point, but, typically —
Q

Were there any motions filed of any kind that

the record shows?

8
MR. ROSE:
your Honor.

There is no indication that there was,

This would typically be the situation where

retained counsel agrees to enter a plea of guilty —
Q

Did the best he could for his

client as he

saw it by way of negotiation probably with the state.
MR. ROSE, Yes, your Honor.
There is the question of knowing, Intelligent waiver.
I say, in this case, knowing, intelligent waiver took place.
Mr. Henderson’s retained counsel apparently and obviously
discussed it.

There is

some question of that that his — and

this was raised by Mr, Henderson in an earlier thing, that his
attorney or that he reluctantly did it, that his attorney
talked him into entering the plea of guilty.
They have talked about this and they have simply
come to the conclusion that to enter a plea of guilty is the
best thing.

At this point, I think Mr, Henderson knew then;

I think the record, the entire record in these proceedings
supports this, that from that point on, he had no more
standing in court, that he was facing a term of 99 years,
that he had eliminated the possibility of a death penalty,
that the proceedings xvere over and, as a matter of fact, they
were over for him for some lo years before he ever came back
to court for anything.
The evidence, the circumstantial evidence, points
to the fact that he knew, and the court had found earlier.

9
that it was a voluntary plea of guilty, that he knew at the
time he entered that plea, that this was the end of the pro­
ceedings.

I am sure that he did not know the constitutional

lav/ that he had numerous rights which many of us have been
years studying those particular things in law schools and
after we are out, too.
There is no evidence and I could admit candidly to
this court that I am sure that it didn’t happen that these
were discussed with him.
prisoner

I daresay that there isn't a

in the penal institutions in Tennessee who knows

all of his constitutional rights and very few lawyers but his
plea of guilty was knowing, intelligent and he knew the
consequences of it.

He knew that he had had his day in

court and that that was the end of the line.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Hoefie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. FRED HOEFLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HOEFLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I think we can assume, following counsel's argument,
that there is no real question now that the rights of
Mr. Henderson to a grand jury of which members of his race
have not been systematically excluded was violated.

It was

10
conceded by the State of Tennessee in the District Court.

It

was conceded in the Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit.
This Court has held recently that this is prejudicial.
There were no blacks on the Grand Jury from 1922
till 1953*

percent of the population of that
This was a violation of the

Respondent's rights under the Equal Protection Clause, as
well as the due process clause that I might point out that
any analogy with the federal rules, I think would be ruled
out because the Equal Protection clause is not available to
federal prisoners.

It is a prohibition on the states.

This Court has also held recently that it is a
presumption of prejudice.
actual

That is, he doesn’t have to show

bias or actual harm, but there is a presumption of

prejudice when his grand jury, when members of his race have
been excluded from his grand jury.
I point to the case of Alexander versus Louisiana,
cited last year, where a timely motion was filed bio object to
the grand jury, but no objection was raised as to: the petit
jury.

He went to trial with the petit

jury and was

convicted and this court nevertheless reversed

because it

felt that the denial of members of his race from the grand
juries was sufficiently Important that it could not be cured
even though he xvere tired by a constitutionally acceptable
j ury.

11
Q

Do you think his taking more than 20 years

to assert the right is a factor in the case?
MR.HOEFLE: Well., I think it is a pathetic factor,
your Honor.

I think it only indicates that he didn’t find

out that he had this right for 20 years.

In the previous

case, Mr. Justice White asked the question about holding some­
thing in reserve.

Well, I know I have got this right.

He might wait six

But this has been

MR. HOEFLE:

Q

I think the fact that he was unaware of

I know, but that might indicate that he might

not have known of his right to object to the composition of
the jury, but how about, were there any allegations that his
guilty plea wasn’t accurate?
MR. HOEFLE:

He alleged, and has alleged, that his

guilty plea was more or less forced out of him.

His attorney

was not present when he was taken from Jail about four days
before the plea, taken to the prosecutor's office —
Q

Does he allege his attorney was incompetent?

MR. HOEFLE:

No, he alleges his attorney was not

there at the time the arrangement was made for the plea.
Four days before his trial, they took him out, in
a meeting with the prosecutor and the police and threatened
him with the chair.
plead guilty.

At that point he said he decided to

His lawyer wasn't even at that meeting, if

we can believe him.
Q

The is also some evidence that there was no

corpus delecti, that there was no murder by anybody, that
the so-called "victim” died of pneumonia.
MR. HOEFLE:

Of pneumonia, that's correct.

So I

13
think he would have a proximate cause defense there and that
*

’would be a good reason not to waive this right had he known
it because a properly constituted grand jury might have felts
pneumonia, maybe we can’t indict him at all.

Or maybe armed

robbery or aggravated assault or whatever they call it in
Tennessee, assault with a deadly weapon.

There are many

things and this Court has also said recently, in jury
exclusion cases, it is impossible to speculate on what the
jury would have said or done and this would apply to a grand
jury as well as —

"You plead guilty?"
"Plead guilty."

never been aware of any irregularity in grand Jury selection.
He never advised his client.

He never discussed about it.

If the Petitioner, which is Mr. Henderson, had any knowledge
of it, he certainly didn’t talk to Mr. Murray, his attorney.
Q

Mr. Murray does rather fully indicate that the

Petitioner did plead guilty, doesn’t he?
MR. HOEFLE:

Q

a question.

Unfortunately, it was not raised.

I feel that I

am limited in this proceeding to defending the Sixth Circuits
opinion and the Sixth Circuit has said that they didn't even
reach that issue because Henderson didn’t raise it in the
district courts, so here we are.

It does disturb me, but I

think that it can be affirmed on ample grounds.
Q

Isn’t there 3ome connection between these two

issues as to whether — I mean, his conviction rests on his
plea of guilty.
MR. HOEPLE:

Yes, your Honor and also the other

issues.

to be indicted by some other kind of a jury, they may have
existed, but he pleaded guilty with advice of counsel.
MR. HOEFLE:

But he says he didn't.

Q

With advice of counsel.

Q

But if the issue — if the Issue of whether he

pleaded guilty or not wasn't raised, if the case proceeded on
the assumption that, yes,

there was a valid plea of guilty,

then aren't you in a little bit of trouble raising some of
these other issues?

16
MR. HOEPLE:
Q

I don't think so, your Honor.

Aren't there Mann and Parker and Brady and

those cases?
MR. HOEPLE:

Well, first of all, those cases all

evolved about, there was consultation between counsel and
client in those cases.
Q

These cases also —

Is that issue here?

MR. HOEPLE:

I think that has got a lot to do with

it as far as the grand jury because there was no consultation.
Henderson didn't know about it.

that this comes completely within the purview of Fay and

Q

He didn't

But these were all facets of the same thing.
He didn’t attack the voluntary plea.

MR. HOEPLE:

No, but I think it is almost implicit in-

MR. HOEFLE:
Q

That Is true.

Well, obviously, a pica of guilty was

entered.
MR. HOEFLE:

These are all part of the same thing,

I have chosen to base my argument on the, what I feel is
plain clear law, Humphrey versus Cady , Peters versus Kiff,
Alexander versus Louisiana, which this Court has decided in
the last term.
Q

I noticed at the end here, at pages A 128,

in fact, there are excerpts of proceedings in 19^8, largely,
though, dealing with selection of the jury.

There doesn't

seem to be, or I couldn't find any here, any minutes of the
proceedings at which he is said to have pled guilty.
MR. HQEPLE:
Q

A 137?

MR. HOEFLE:
Pardon me, 135.

There is, your Honor, at A 137.

Yes.

It's not a transcript, however.

It is more or less, I guess, a journal

entry, setting forth the fact that "It came on for hearing on
a plea of guilty and that these jurors were sworn to —"
Q

Right.

MR. HOEFLE:

I assume they were all white also,

but he didn't make objection.
Q

Was there

any colloquy between the judge and

18
this Petitioner when his plea was entered?
?

MR. HOEFLE:

There is no record and another thing.,

the requirements of Boykin about the fact that the judge must
satisfy himself.
Q

Yes, but this was back in 1948.

MR. HOEFLE:
Q

Right.

There doesn’t seem to be, at least, any

transcript of any proceedings Involving any kind of colloquy
with the court when his plea of guilty was entered.
MR. HOEFLE:

I could find out,

are transcripts of testimony that

your Honor, there

occurred at the habeas

corpus hearing in the state court which was what was relied
upon in lieu of a hearing by the federal district court.
Q

Well, did you allege in your federal habeas

that the plea of guilty was involuntary?
MR. HOEFLE:
se.

Henderson did, your Honor.

It was per

I didn’t get into it until the circuit court level.
Q

What was the district court’s ruling on that

aspect of his petition?
MR* HOEFLE:

He declined to consider it.

He

indicated, I believe, that first of all, he went forth on the
systematic exclusion issue and did not consider the others.
But —
Q

The journal entry, as you call it, indicates

that after a guilty plea, a jury wras impanneled to sentence.

19
HR. HOEFLE:
Q

Yes, to sentence.

That is a little alien to the way it is done

in ir.ost jurisdictions, isn’t it, if there is a guilty plea.
Q

That was for the punishment, wasn’t it?

MR. HOEFLE:
Q

Is that right?

MR. HOEFLE:
Q

That was just for the punishment.

The —

And that stayed, at least at that time in

jury until they had assessed the punishment.
MR. HOEFLE:

I assume they were all white, too

and deliberated —
Q

Although the Indication was, from General Rose,

that the punishment had been kind of agreed upon, beforehand.
MR. HOEFLE:

It would seem that there had been some

discussion, but I don’t see how we can infer that.
Q

No.

Q

Well, it

says that they found the defendants

guilty of murder in the first degree.
Q

And that

MR. HOEFLE:

Yes, I guess based on the plea, they

determined the guilt and
Q

went on from there.

Was this like the British one where the jurors

are struck if you find a man guilty of stealing a watch, go
out and consider your verdict?
MR. HOEFLE:

Is that what this is?

I’m not sure.

It doesn’t say.

I’m

not familiar with Tennessee procedure, your Honor, I9m sorry.
It definitely is — um —
Q

Would it be fair to say that Mr. Henderson

might have had a little luck here?
raised the point back in »-48?

Suppose his counsel had

Suppose there had been a new

indictment by a validly-selected grardjury and he had been
tried and convicted?

He might have been executed, might he

not?
MR. HOEFLE:
a distinct possibility.

Yes, he might have.

I think that was

But, again, as Mr. Justice Stewart

pointed out, the record that we have indicates that the
decedent died of pneumonia.

Perhaps it was caused by the

gunshot wound, perhaps it wasn’t.
Q

It’s hard to say.

Mr. Hoefle, do you know, did Tennessee

practice at that time, when the guilty determined punishment
after the entry of a guilty plea, was it limited to giving himor was a death penalty then excluded?
MR. HOEFLE:
don't believe.
Q

That I don’t — not by statute, I

I know some states have excluded it, but —
You mean he pleaded

guilty and he might still

have got the death penalty?
MR. HOEFLE:

I believe that is correct, your Honor,

but I really — I don’t want to give you a definitive
answer on that.
Q

Is it possible or reasonable in this kind of

21
a negotiation for a plea that the prosecutor would then, in
going to the county jury, make certain that the plea
negotiation was carried out?
MR. HOEPLS:
Q

I assume it is possible.

It is possible that he could.

MR. HOEFLE:
Q

I assume it is possible, your Honor.

That is, he would ask for only a light

sentence, not for the death penalty.
Q

The only thing is, again. In one of your

recent cases last year, I don’t remember which one, but it
was stated rather emphatically that it Is impossible to tell
what the jury would have done.

Who knows what the grand jury

would have done in the face of the fact that the decedent
died of pneumonia.

It is obviously prejudicial.

They had

been donlng this at that time for 68 years down in
Tennessee.

The — Mr. Henderson was totally Ignorant of

his right to object for 20 years.

His lawyer didn’t tell him.

His lawyer came in and testified and the state did not
challenge his lawyer, as they could have.

What did you talk

about besides the fact that you didn’t talk about the fact
that he had a bad grand jury?
The one thing I do want to mention about the
McMann cases also, number one, as has been pointed out, the
act of waiver in Tennessee is the entry of a plea.
doesn’t matter.

If he had pleaded not guilty, under

It

22
Tennessee law, It would have been as effective a waiver as
had he pleaded guilty.
Q

If he had pleaded not guilty without having

made a motion.
MR. HOEFLE:
Q

Yes.

Once he pleaded to the indictment, he waived

the right to make any motion challenging the grand jury.

Is

that your point?
MR. HOEFLE:

That’s my point, your Honor.

I don’t

think the fact that the plea was guilty can be said to be a
separate ground.

In the Post-Leary and cases dealing

with

the narcotics transfer tax and the firearms tax, five circuits
have held that people, defendants who have pleaded guilty
prior to these decisions, they have not waived, by pleading
guilty, their right to object to the self-incrimination things,
aspects that this court found invalid.
decided

this are unanimous.

The circuits that have

They are saying, we are not

attacking the fact that the plea ’was voluntary.

VJe are just

saying he did plead guilty voluntarily but even in doing so
there, he did not intend to waive his right to raise this
objection had he known about it.
How, even there, there would have been some
inkling, I would think they knew these cases were on their
way upstairs, but I don’t think Mr. Henderson even had that
much benefit.

23
The Fifth Circuit, in at least six cases, and in one
case particularly, they took judicial notice of the fact that
white .lawyers representing black defendants in the south
rarely to the point of never, raised these objections at the
proper time, if ever and I don't see — I think this case
squarely falls within Fay v, Nola and Johnson versus Zerbstand I am afraid that if the Court does reverse, that the
impact of these cases is going to be lost and it will all
go back to the state courts and they will have to determine
federal rights.
Q

And in this case, in the state supreme court

you had concurring opinions stating just what you have said,
didn't you, no lawyer would have thought of bringing this up.
MR. HOEFLE:

That's correct, yes, and I believe that

was the court of criminal appeals and then in the Tennessee
Supreme Court I believe, another opinion said, rather regret­
fully, declined Henderson the relief and said, perhaps it's
overdue.

It should come from someone higher than us.

And

here we are.
Q

I think you were spreading it a little far

when you said "no one."

I know one who did.

Q

Well, successfully.

Q

A lawyer in Chatanooga, Tennessee did raise

it and he was white.
MR. HOEFLE:

So there was at least one.
I see.

Well, these objections have

24
been raised,
Q

Well, you said none.

HR. HOEFLE:
Q

You said none.

I'm sorry.

I don’t think you have to go as far as "none.

That’s all I’m saying.
HR. HOEFLE:

I'm sorry, I was quoting the Fifth

Circuit and I guess they were talking for their circuit,
which Tennessee is part of the Sixth Circuit.
Q

The Fifth Circuit was talking about

Mississippi.
Q

Well, according to the brief, there was

another lawyer who did, too, in an adjoining county.
Q

Well, I don't think there was.

MR. HOEFLE:

Yes, there was, I believe.

I might point out in that situation, on the
Kennedy case, that there is a distinction.

The Maurle County

Grand Jury was perhaps disproportionally represented with
blacks but it did have some blacks on it.

This county had

none.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Did you have anything further, Mr. Rose?
MR. ROSE:

Yes, your Honor.

25
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. JACKSON ROSE3 ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it please

the Court —
Q

What's the historical rule for 99 years in

Tennessee?
MR. ROSE:
Q

Thirty years.

Thirty?

MR. ROSE:

The same — any penalty, you're entitled

a maximum of thirty years.
As there was some question about whether the guilty
plea was raised , the voluntariness of the guilty plea,
this question was raised earlier.

It was decided, in the

case of Henderson, it would be Henderson in the Sixth
Circuit, number 1785 in 1968, and cert was denied in 391
U.S. 927 by this Court according
my petition for

to the — and this is in

certiorari in the Appendix page 2A in the

footnotes to the Sixth Circuit opinion.

In those early pro

se petitions, he did claim that his confession had been
coerced and that his guilty plea was therefore involuntary.
He also asserted that he had been denied the assistance of
counsel.
The district court considered these claims and
decided them adversely on the merits and we affirmed.

The

question of impaneling a jury to Impose sentence, this is

26
done in Tennessee.

It may appear to be somewhat of a fiction.

Where there will be a negotiated plea, a jury is impaneled.
The situation is presented to the jury., typically, by the
district attorney general.

He says it is the recommendation

of the state and we have agreed to a number of years being
99.

The jury walks out and comes back in and back at that

time, many times there was some evidence introduced to the
jury even though there was a guilty plea.
necessary now.

This is not

I'm not sure whether it was necessary then

but at any rate it was done and has been done in recent years
•when I have practiced law.
Q

Mr. Rose, did you make certain back in 19^8

that the jury would not bring in the death penalty?
MR. ROSE:

If

it please the Court, that is the

problem I have never been faced with.

I would say typically

when it is presented to them that a guilty plea is going in
for a 99 year sentence, do you agree with that?

That is

about the way it is presented to the jury.
Q

You mean the judge addresses the jury this

way?
MR. ROSE:
Q

Oh, I see.

HR. ROSE:
been

Yes, your Honor.

And the jury, in the cases that I had

involved in always came back and did what the judge

instructed them to do.

27
Q

Do they do these by vox?

MR. ROSE:
q

Yes, your Honor.

They do these —

MR. ROSE:

Well, not necessarily.

I've seen — as

I recall now, and I didn’t realize we'd get into this, I've
seen them, they say, "So say you all and will you raise
your hand?”

Mow that I am refreshing my memory on it.

I would like to bring up — the Parker case was
brought up.

I'm sure this court was aware of it, but in the

Fourth Circuit, did deny Parker relief on — in December of
this past year on his petition for habeas corpus on the same
issue that is presented here today and relied on the trilogy
of cases, ilcllann, Brady and Parker previously decided by
this court.

The number in that court is 71-1925, Parker

versus Ross.
This is — I would like to reiterate further, or
in answer to Mr. Hoefle, this is not similar to Hoia or
Johnson or there is a distinguishing characteristic.

That is

one, that he knowingly, intelligently made a guilty plea,
knowing the consequences of it, had his day in court and
knew that it was over and, number two, the constitutional
error alleged in this case did not go to the innocence or
guilt and was a matter that was curable at that time but
that is not curable at this time.
Q

Well, what about the allegation that the

28
lawyer didn't know of his right at all?
MR, ROSE’.:

The record does not say that.

Q

so and so.

Yes, and then he said he didn't think of doing
What did he say?

What did he say?
MR. ROSE;
Q

No, your Honor —

What about the right to object?

MR. ROSE:

I’m sure he — I mean, I have to

concede that this was not discussed and from the record, was
not entertained in the mind of the attorney or the defendant,
Mr. Henderson, at that time.
I say it is a knowing, Intelligent waiver, even
though they didn’t directly say, we’re going to waive this.
He knew —
Q

You think it was a knowing, intelligent plea

of guilty and that is all you need?
MR. ROSE:

Well, knowing, intelligent plea of

guilty and that it was a conclusion of his —
Q

Which is a waiver of a right to go to trial.

MR. ROSE:
Q

Waiver of the right —

And I would say that’s about all you need.

29
MR. ROSE:

Yes, your Honor, In a curable defect

that exists at this time.
His affidavit was just that he had no knowledge
that they were excluded at that time from the grand jury,
from the petit jury on page A 95 of the Appendix and A 96.
He did not say that he was unaware of the right to attack
the composition of the grand jury on the basis of systematic
exclusion of blacks.
Really, It is not the question of systematic
exclusion of blacks as much as It is the systematic exclusion
of anybody, or the illegal composition of a grand jury.

A

black has no more right to a legally-constituted grand jury
than any other person In court.

And, such as in Shotwell —

Shotwell had the same right to a constitutional grand jury
that Hr. Henderson had.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rose,

the case is submitted.
Mr. Hoefle, you appeared here by our appointment and
at our request and —
MR. HOEFLE:

Yes, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

— on behalf of the

Court, I want to thank you for your assistance to your
client and your assistance to the Court.
MR. HOEFLE:

Thank you, your Honor.

(Whereupon, at 2:32 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.)
