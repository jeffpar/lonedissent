MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-459, Sloan against Lemon, and 72-620, Greater
against Lemony the two cases being consolidated,
Mr, Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you"re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ISRAEL PACKEL, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT GRACE SLOAN
MR. PACKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
I appear to make one point, and I think it's the
controlling pointy and that is that the dominant purpose and
the primary effect of the Pennsylvania Act is economic and
not religious.
Of course I realize that the case does have
sociological and religious collateral effects.

But I say

that essentially we are dealing here with an economic measure;
by the Commonwealth.
What is the economic situation that confronted
Pennsylvania here?

There were several factors.

First of all, and I am of course talking about
education — first of all, in our schools throughout the
Commonwealth, and particularly in Pennsylvania, there was a
serious financial situation*

I think this Court can take

judicial notice of the two serious strikes that we had in the

City of Philadelphia because of financial problems„
Secondly, there was the factor that 20 percent of
the students in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were going to
non-public schools,,
Thirdly, the average annual cost for a student in a
public school was $980 per year.
The next item was the fact that many of the non-public
schools were threatening, there was a present danger that they
were going to shift, give up their school and the students would
all be, a great many of them would be shifted to a public school,
And the fourth significant factor is the obvious
one, true in so many of the States, Pennsylvania, under its
constitution, had the duty to make provision for the education
of all its young»
Now, what to do?

How to cope with this economic

situation?
The Legislature came to the conclusion that the
thing to be done was to offer to parents of non-public
students $75 if they were in elementary schools or $150
if they were in a secondary school0
was saying to these parents:

In effect, Pennsylvania

Look, folks, if we have your

students here, not only would we have a tremendous capital
program, which will take millions and millions of dollars to
build enough schools, but if you continue to send your
children to the school where you have been sending them, if

you don’t switch then we would be saving, at the least, $980j
and to induce you to keep doing that, because of the economic
plight in which we are, we will pay you the $150 or $75 per
student»
It was purely this economic measure, it’s spelled out
in the legislation, the General Assembly made it crystal-clear
that this was an economic motive in which they were trying to
cope with this very, very serious situation before them*,
Really, I think in the analysis you've got to
consider this very high function of this Court, to say that
legislation of a State is unconstitutional, ought to be
asserted only in the case where are illegitimate ends being
sought to be achieved,
I can't help but make the analogy — it may be a
little far-fetched — I'm thinking of the Twenties and the
earlier period when you had the situation in dealing with
congressional power, where the Court would says

Well, you

may have the power, but what you’re trying to do with this
statute, its

collateral effects are something different,

I’m thinking, for example, of the prison labor case, or the
cases where Congress purported, attempted to regulate inter­
state commerce, and this Court used to says

Oh, well, if what

you’re trying to accomplish, if you’re trying to regulate
manufacturing, or if it has the effect of regulating manu­
facturing, we don’t care, even though you are asserting a power

6

over interstate commerce.
Similarly, I say, here we shouldn't look to the
collateral effect where the Legislature is clearly asserting
a legitimate end.

Here the Pennsylvania Legislature said we're

trying to save money so that the schools will be conducted
properly.
Sure, it has a collateral effect.
benefit.

It gives some

But I say, look at the main object of what the

Legislature is trying to do? and, for that reason, this
legislation should be held constitutional.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Ball.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BENTLEY BALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS DIAZ, ET AL.
MR. BALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
The Commonwealth, following Lemon vs. Kurtzman,
carefully structured the Act which you're considering today,
structured it to try fully and faithfully to meet every
standard which this Court had expressed in its various
decisions under the Establishment Clause.
Why?

%

In an effort to solve a twofold problem which

simply won't go away.
The first part of that problem having been described

7
by the Attorney General just now, a massive public problem
which involves the total fiscal, economic, and educational
crisis that the Commonwealth today does face.
And secondly, the severe problem of thousands of
Pennsylvania individual parents, broad masses of parents

in

the middle-income group, and including the lower income >
parents in Pennsylvania, who are involved in a problem relating
to law, to conscience, and to family economy.
May it please the Court, I represent twelve such
parents here this afternoon.

The group described in our

papers as Jose Diaz, et al., who last year had paid a tuition
at a Protestant, a Catholic, a Jewish, or a non-sectarian
school.

They are members of a numerous group in Pennsylvania

who are, in fact, truly caught in a three-sided vise»
They are faced with the compulsion of law, to begin
with.

They’re faced with the fact that the, under criminal

sanction, the Pennsylvania Compulsory Attendance Law requires;
them to have their children in some school, which meets
reasonable State requirements.
They are also under legal compulsion, of course, to
do what they have always been doing, they are all taxpayers,
in paying their public school tax.
i

They also face a compulsion of conscience, ttfhich
impels them to seek other education for their children.
And, thirdly, they are faced with the twin effects

3

— which we hardly need describe further today — of inflation
and taxation.
Now, how does Act 92 seek to remedy this problem?
It does it by giving unearmarked payments to peoplewhom the Legislature determine to have special need because
they carry a special burden.

The proof of that burden, the

General Assembly found to be —■ the best selected proof of
their carrying of this burden was the fact that they had in
fact paid a tuition at a non-public school the year past.
Now, the court below looked at this statute, found
it unconstitutional.

The court below said that this statute —

first of all, it said it had a secular legislative purpose,
and that th$t winged the court's tests.

#

It then looked at the entanglement problem and
found no kind of entanglement whatever to be involved in this
statute.

But it did at least grope at the idea that the

statute has a primary effect of advancing religions,

I say

the court groped at it, because as you read the opinion you
find that it's hard to point it right down, where you find
the court truly talking about

premise,

or principal

character of effect and advancing religion rather than having
possibly a relationship to religion.
At any rate, the court based, what we will be willing
to call, the failure of the Act to meet the primary effect
test on three different arguments.

9

The first that the parents were merely a conduit
under the Act, that they are merely a conduit under the Act
for the payment of public funds to non-public schools,
Secondly, that it was possible and quite likely that
the parents were going to use the money they got under these
payments in the future for payments to sectarian schools0
Thirdly, the court pointed out — and this is not
in its opinion, but appears in its order, its final order, at
page 53a of the Appendix -- pointed out that, or stated that
90 percent of the children attending non-public schools in

•

Pennsylvania are enrolled in schools which are religious in
character-

There was no record evidence of this, but this

was the court's reasoning.
As to the conduit argument, here the court
immediately invoked, as did, as did Mr, Pfeffer this morning,
the tuition grant cases from the Southern States, Almond vs.
Day and so on, and equated the arrangement provided by the
Act with the situation found in those cases.

The handing

to a parent of a check which would be negotiable only at an
institution, or the providing of a parent with a voucher which
he then could take and exchange for education at an institution.
None of these techniques appear in this Act,
is no such provision under Act 92-

There

There’s no condition

whatever attached to payment tinder this Act-

The money does

in fact, in legal fact, become that of the parent.

It’s

10

subject to his unlimited power of disposal.
his private money.

The money becomes

And regardless of what hopes the State

public policy has, as to how he may relieve the education
crisis, in expending this through tuition, the very legal fact
of the Act is that he may use it for education or he may not.
He need not, under the terms of the Act, use it for education.
No institution — and I want to underscore this to
Your Honors

no institution has a breadth of legal claim,

right, title, or interest in one cent of the money in question.
Now, the court, almost as though it felt it couldn’t
make the conduct argument stick, invented then an amazingly,
very standard for constitutional adjudication in its rule of
possible and quite likely.
The court said this, that the Act offended the
Establishment Clause and now I quote, "a possible and quite
likely use of the aid under review is to enable parents to
continue to pay tuition at sectarian schools.”

This rule

has no foundations in decisions of this Court, it's guesswork,
perhaps it’s intelligent guesswork, but it is that.
It certainly does not measure up to, and is not
synonymous with or an equivalent of, the clear standard which
this Court stated when it said that, to meet the strictures
of the Establishment Clause, it must be shown that an enactment
does not have a primary effect advancing religion.
Thirdly, on the matter of 90 percent.

I mentioned

11
to the Court that there was no record evidence at all on the
90 percent figure respecting children.

However? it also must

be considered that these payments go to individuals? and the
%

law controls or conditions no man’s choice under this Act?
the choice of no parent.
Thirdly? if one is to take and play the percentage
game? I think we begin to invite problems which have
possibly not been foreseen.

If one were to make a head

count with respect to who is getting certain welfare benefits
or who is benefitting under an anti-poverty program? and
then determine? as a result of that head count? that the
people who are beneficiaries were 90 percent blacks? would
this make this class legislation?
We've just enacted a perfectly splendid program?
an immensely humane program for relief? of relief through
expenditure of some $135 million of taxpayers' money for
resettlement in Israel of Jewish refugees from religious
persecution in the Soviet Union.
Undoubtedly 90 percent of these individuals are of
a single religious faith.

Certainly this cannot be taken as

a standard for invalidating any such program.
What we have here? then? we believe is a measure
which in no wise offends the Establishment Clause.

We have?

however? raised affirmative defenses? as Your Honors have
doubtless noted in our brief and from the record.

The parents

12

in this case have raised affirmative defenses of equal
protection, which I should like briefly to comment upon.
I should point out at the outset that we are not
here arguing the proposition which was argued for in Brusca,
the case to which Mr. Pfeffer referred this morning, where
parents of non-public school children asserted that they had a
constitutional right to participate in public funds, a right
to have these funds devoted to non-public education.
Rather, here a statute exists, and that statute
gives unearmarked assistance benefits to a class of parents
rationally determined and without conditions attached.
I’d like to talk first of all about parents who are
described in the papers and in our brief as the Watson parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Watson have a daughter, Ellen, who attends
Baldwin School, a non-sectarian school, in Pennsylvania.

They

are express beneficiaries of this Act; they are parents of
non-public school children and non-public school is clearly
defined in the Act in a measure and in a way that includes
non-sectarian, non-public schools.
They cannot have an Establishment problem; there’s
no way that they can have an Establishment problem.
They moved for summary judgment in the lower court,
and the court denied their motion on the peculiar ground that
although they were — had been granted intervention as of
right, the court's reasoning was that the plaintiffs had sought

13

no relief against them*
Later, the order of the court was to state that
90 percent of the beneficiaries of this Act being the parents
of children attending sectarian schools, they, the court
undoubtedly by that sought to provide another means for
denying these individuals the benefits of the Act*
It's perfectly clear that to cut the Watsons out of
the Act, on the ground that they are minority beneficiaries
under the court*s reasoning, would certainly be a denial of
equal protection.
To say that they were not intended beneficiaries
of the Act directly conflicts with what the Legislature itself
said in its definition of parents and or non~public schools.
The second group of beneficiaries under this Act,
whom we're here to speak for today, are Mr, and Mrs. Jose
Diaz, who have a boy, Jose, Jr., in St, Peter Apostles
School in Philadelphia; Mr. and Mrs. Kretzmann, whose daughter,
Debbie, attended Redeemer Lutheran School and is now attending
public school —* here, incidentally, may it please the Court,
is an example of a parent who is eligible today for the
benefit of the Act, on account of the fact that he had had,
these parents had had their children, they had paid the
tuition for their children in a school, in a sectarian
school.

Wow they have elected — high school time has come,

and they have elected to send this child to a public school.

14
Another pair of parents are Mr. and Mrs* Zimmerspitz,
who have their daughter, Rochelle, at Beth Jacob School.
Now, these people have been told by the court that they may
not participate in the benefits of this Act; the court below
mi

said that these latter parents cannot be paid because of two
things 5

First of all, they had antecedently paid, out of their

own pockets, money for tuition last year.

Secondly, the court

thinks it’s likely, possible and quite likely, that in another
year they will pay another tuition to maintain that child in a
sectarian school.
Even though, as we have said, the payment of that
subsequent tuition is absolutely, certainly a payment out of
private money.
Therefore, the court has said that these parents
must be excluded from a public welfare benefit.
what?

Because of

Because they exercised an act of the will whereby

yesterday they spent their own money, their own private money,
because of their religion, and tomorrow, for the same reason,
they may again expend their private money.
A person certainly may not be excluded from a program
of public welfare benefits because of his race, because of
alienage, or because he has done something which is nothing
other than an exercise of religious choice.
Finally, may it please the Court, the appellees have
devoted some time and much vigor in speaking of political

15
entanglement with respect to this Act,
We have pointed out in our brief this Act is selfexecuting, paid for out of the cigarette tax.

There is no

record, the court below in no way discussed any such issue,
and there is no record whatsoever of any evidence at all that
the plaintiff sought to introduce below on this issue,
preferring, conceivably, to leave the matter to supposition,
to guesswork.
In conclusion, may I say to the Court that a
secular need of the nation is today, in a growingly socialized
society, for people to be reasonably enabled to follow
conscientious choices.

Nowhere is this more important than

with respect to education.

Especially under this Act, where

it is possible that such choice may help some parents to rear
their children in the traditions of civility, non-violence,
decency, and morality,
I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Ball.

Mr. Reath.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY T. REATH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT CROUTER
MR. REATH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I appear here today on behalf of one parent with
children in non-public schools, private independent schools.

16

I am also counsel for the Pennsylvania Association of
Independent Schools, mid, in essence, I speak really on behalf
of all of the parents of children attending non-public
schools within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
I think that at the outset it is important to note
that the tremendous diversity of interests that have shown
their unqualified support for this Pennsylvania Act*
For example, we have filed in this case or in the
court below amicus briefs from the Solicitor General on
behalf of the Federal Government! a very strong brief filed
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on behalf of the people
of Pennsylvania? there is an exceptionally strong brief filed
by the City Solicitor on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and
its financially beleagured school district?

there is a

brief that has been filed by the National Association of
Independent Schools supporting 100 percent this Act? there is
also an amicus brief that was filed in the court below by
the Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools? and
finally, and I think most significantly, Your Honors will see
attached to our brief a copy of the amicus brief filed in the.
court below by the Benjamin Banneker Free School, which is a
school in a predominantly urban ghetto district of Philadelphia,
and it is a school which depends almost entirely upon
individual tuitions.
And because all of the students attending that school

17
are eligible, they, too, have joined in
QUESTION:

Do you want us to count these up, and

decide on plurality?
MR. REATII:

No, sir.

[Laughter.]
Not at all, Mr* Justice Marshall*

I think the only

point that I want to mention is that the effect of this Act
is to cover every segment of education in Pennsylvania, and
in no way could it be said that either its purpose or effect
was designed solely for religious or secular schools*
Now, if Your Honors please, I would like to
respectfully state to the Court that if this Court affirms
the rationale — if this Court affirms the rationale of the
lower court in holding Pennsylvania Act 92 unconstitutional,
then you have to invalidate every major piece of Federal
and most State legislation, including the G.I* Bill and its
successor, whereby grants or low-interest loans with liberal
forgiveness provisions are given to college and postgraduate
students*
For example, under the 1958 National Defense Student
Loan Program Act, as greatly expanded by the Higher Education
Act of 1965, there is presently in excess of $1 billion being
paid out to several million students of college age attending
higher education and postgraduate work.
But .these Acts, if Your Honors please, as is the case

18

with the Pennsylvania Act which was stricken, and for the
reason that the Pennsylvania Act was stricken, do not place any
restriction whatsoever to insure that the funds are restricted,
and here I quote the language of the lower court, "to secular
education or general welfare services,"
As a matter of fact, it would even invalidate an
Act which has been in effect for the last 25 years, whereby
the Congress authorizes Pages in this very Court to receive
a private education, non-public education at a private or
parochial school of their choice.

And there is absolutely,

of course, in that Act, not only not a restriction but a
recognition that as long as the money goes to the child or to
the parent, and the parent is the one who controls the choice
of school, that does not constitute any Act of the State or
of the Federal Government involved in advancing religion,"
but, to the contrary, it is the traditional role of the State
or Federal Government being absolutely neutral.
Now, in this case, Your Honors, there were three
points that the lower court made that were absolutely wrong
and show how totally in error they were in upsetting this Act.
The first, of course, is the failure to restrict to
sectarian education.

A concept that this Court has never

accepted, and I would hope that the Court never would, with
the frightful consequences that would flow as a result of
such a narrow

interpretation.

19

The second had to do with the so-called conduit
theory.

What the court said was# Well# it doesn't really make

any difference# when you pay the money to the parent you
really are giving it to the school# and why try to say that
there's any essential difference or distinction?
And then finally# as Mr. Ball pointed out# what the
court tried to do was to buoy up the weakness of the other
two arguments and say# Well# anyhow# we find that the effect
of this Act# even though the purpose is secular in nature
to advance education# that the effect of the Act is to aid and
advance religion because we find# as a matter of judicial
notice# that 90 percent of the children who might be
benefitted are attending parochial schools.
Now# as far as the — I think that here is the point
that X want to make as emphatically, Your Honors# as I possibly
can:

that where the court fell into the error of its ways

in the lower court was that it totally and completely misunder­
stood the problem facing this Court in Lemon and Tilton and
DiCenso# where the Court was trying to experiment# or trying
to find the outer and the inner limit of how you could pay
money directly to an institution? directly to an institution:,
That was the problem in Tilton that Mrs Chief Justice had
to resolve# that was the problem in Lemon v, Kurtzman.

The

funds were paid to the institution# it was the institution
that had the control of the funds and not the parents,

20

Now, in order to cope with that problem, and in
order to face up to that situation, the Court in Tilton quite
properly said, If you're going to pay funds to an institution,
we want some safeguard»

And those safeguards were this

prohibition against religious use»
Now, as far as the conduit theory*

The conduit —

what they say is that it makes no difference, it*s a distinction
without a difference.

We say to Your Honors it is a distinction

which makes all the difference, because when you pay the money
to the parent, the parent becomes the wall of separation
between Church and State; the recipient institution who may
ultimately benefit, of course they will indirectly benefit
from this tuition program, in a sense, but they have no call
on the fluids, There is no way that they can insure year after
year they're going to get the funds.
That isn't true where you have payments made directly
to the institution.
Secondly, the State has no control over the use of
the funds.
Now, I would like, if I may, to read to the Court
one statement that was made by Kingman Brewster, in a Report
of the President, at Yale University in 1970, because I think
it illustrates the very basic and fundamental difference,
whether you're dealing in secondary education or in higher
"nation, between payment to the parent and payment to the

21
institution»
And here's what Mr- Brewster said, talking about the
plight of higher educations
"The only other prospect for a new tributary to feed
Yale's income stream would be the introduction of some massive
program of Federal assistance,,

If this took the form of

assisting students, either with grants or with a guarantee of
their postponed tuition payment, it would be quite consistent
with the university's freedom and autonomy«
"If, on the other hand, new Federal subvention were
to taka the form of direct bloc grants to the institution,
there would be serious worries about the dependence upon
political favor which this would entail*

If Federal

assistance became built into Yale's budget, we might find
ourselves in

a

terrible bind if a shift in national priorities

cut off the pipeline»
"More serious would be the temptation of some future
Congress to attach strings and conditions to such grants.
Future legislators might seek to bend or warp, if not direct
our educational research or admissions policy,"
And to the same effect is the statement made by
William Bowen, now president of Princeton University, in which
he said exactly the same thing, highlighting the essential
distinction between payment to the parent and payment to an
institution

22

Indeed, one of the great advantages of channeling
funds for higher education through the student is that this
minimizes the danger of political control of higher education.
Now, in addition to the practical considerations,
Your Honors, there are two very significant and major
constitutional differences, where the money is paid to the
parent rather than to the institution.

One of them is

illustrated by the Judd case, which is cited by Mr. Mann in
his brief, because he says there that it doesn't make any
difference whether it's a direct or an indirect payment.
Well, it makes a tremendous difference, because in
the Judd case, which, interestingly enough, was decided eight;
years before Everson, and it had to do with whether or not
the State of New York could provide busing for parents, there
the Court held that there was an indirect benefit and that
you were dealing with an indirect benefit and that that was
a specific violation of a very specific provision in the
New York State Constitution, which, under Section 4 of Article
IX of the Constitutione, says:

that you may not use public

funds to be used directly or indirectly in aid or maintenance,
other than for — et cetera — for an educational institution
that teaches a specific religious dogma.
Then, and I don't have time to read it now, but I
would ask you to make note of the Court's — at page 212 of the
Court's decision in this regard, where the Court pointed out

23

that the reason that there was such a difference —- that
there was no difference between a direct and indirect was
because the statute specifically said direct or indirect.
That clearly# as Your Honors know, is not the test
that this Court has decided in the — in Everson, in Allen,
and in Tilton,

The mere fact that a religious institution

may benefit indirectly does not constitute a violation of the
Establishment Clause,
Now, the other constitutional difference, and this
is referred to in my brief and I won’t have time to develop
it extensively before the Court, but it's in our brief at
page 32,

The other significant constitutional difference,

when you pay money to the parent, is that when the parent
gets this money, I submit to Your Honors, that at that point
he is free from any further inquiry by the State, by the
court or any other body, as to what he does with it and what
are or are not the religious practices of the school to which
he elects to send his children.
This is under the very same First Amendment rights,
and the other rights that this Court has found, such as the
right of privacy* which was discussed in Hoe v, Wade and
other cases, where the Court has said that you are free from
inquiry? and if you’re free from inquiry, you cannot trace
and attempt to trace the funds from the parent into any
religious institution.

24
And therein, you see, lies the error of the ways of
the lower court„

Because what the lower court did, they were

faced with this problem, as we've pointed out in our brief,
early in the pleading; but they ultimately swept the problem
under the rug and in the final decision of the court they
said, Well, we find as a practical matter that 9C percent of
the parents who will benefit have children who are going to
religious schools.
But you cannot, where the money is paid to the
parent, I suggest, you cannot make any determination of what
happens thereafter, you cannot make any determination in trying
to trace the religious or non-religious use.

And if you can't

do that, and that, then, brings me, if Your Honors please, to
the last point that I want to make.
It has to do with the whole question of burden of
proof.

This Court has said time and time again that a party

coming into this Court or the Federal Court, to ask this
Court to use the extraordinary power it has of declaring
State action unconstitutional, must carry the burden and he
must establish those facts on the record that show that there
is a religious effect, for example, in this case.
Secondly, this Court has said over and over again
that there is a very heavy presumption of constitutionality
to State action, and that the Court will only overrule State
action, will reverse State action in the very clearest of cases„

25
And finally, this Court — Mr. Justice Powell will
know very well of what I speak, in the Court's opinion in the
Rodriquez case, and as reaffirmed as lately as in Lemon y.
Sloan, Ho. 2, where the Court again pointed out that the
reluctance of this Court in a Federal system to substitute
its judgment or to interfere with the delicate and complex
problems of social and educational policy that are involved
in this whole question of whether you're going to support
pluralism in education or whether you're going to have a
single, all-embracing, monolithic public system.
Now, I would be the first to admit that there are
good, sound arguments to be made for both.

It happens,

however, that Pennsylvania has made a commitment to
pluralism, and one which I happily endorse and applaud? but
the fact of the matter is that I think that that is a matter
for the individual several States.
And if there is any doubt as to the will and desire
of the several States, I would ask Your Honors to take a look,
when you review this case further, at Exhibit C of our brief,
where we have attached a list of the different ways in which
the several States have attempted to make their major commitment to pluralism in education„
I would like to close my remarks, if I may, by
reading several lines from the brief of the National Association
of Independent Schools, which I think speaks as eloquently to

26

this whole problem as any language that has been set down on
paper to date.

And it is as follows?

"To say, as some critics do — and without a shred
of evidence to support it — that the parent acts as a mere
conduit to the school, is to denigrate the very stuff of which
this country*s greatness was made and to undermine the rock
upon which our Constitution and Bill of Rights is grounded *—*
personal freedom and the right of each individual to make his
own free choice.
"Where the parent is the recipient of State aid, he
alone decides how and where the funds are applied and thus
effectively cuts off State control or participation, thereby
enabling the State to aid its legitimate interests in
secular education, and at the same time, to preserve, in the
words of the Chief Justice, the spirt of ’benevolent neutrality*
which will neither advance nor inhibit religion.
"This is in the best tradition of a country that
treasures its private institutions and the freedom and rights
of individuals.

Far from offending the Constitution, tuition

aid to parents supports and reinforces the very principles the
Constitution was designed to protect."
We ask this Court to reverse the lower court and to
find that this is a lawful exercise of the State’s concern
with preserving pluralism in education, and to find that the
Pennsylvania Act 92, of parent reimbursement, is in every sense

27
constitutional.
Thank you,. Your Honors.
QUESTION;

Mr- Reath, before you sit down, in a

word or two, what's the difference between this case and
Wolman v. Essex, which was affirmed last fall?
MR. REATHs
differences.

There are several very fundamental

I think the most important, Your Honor, is that

this bill, as has been pointed out previously, is selfexecuting.
QUESTION:

It uses 23 percent of the cigarette

taxes, right?
MR. REATH:

Yes, sir.
It doesn't require an appropriation.

MR. REATH:

That is correct.

Anything else?

MR. REATH:

Well, there are other differences in

the structure of the Act-

In Wolman, it was part of a total

educational appropriation, which I guess comes back to the
same point of one year, and I confess that I'm not familiar,
Your Honor, with the intimate workings of the Ohio case, but
I think that essentially, that that is the basis that Ohio
was turned down in the lower court was on the concept of
entanglement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE R. MANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. MANN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
May I first express my deep appreciation to the
Court for having found sufficient play in the joints of the
First Amendment to have accommodated the religious sensibilities
of several of us by extending argument to 3;30 today, which I
trust is not a violation of the wall between separation of
Church and State,
And I will try to repay that kindness by taking
considerably less than my full time.
If it please the Court, it is our judgment that Act
92 is unconstitutional in purpose, in effect, and because of
the political divisiveness that it causes.
Very briefly, it's our judgment that it passes none
of the standards that the Court has recently set forth,
I will take just a moment on purpose.

I am, of

course, well aware that this Court, in the last Lemon-Pennsylvania
case, found that the legislative purpose must be accorded

30

appropriate deference,.

But I call to the Court's attention

that the legislative purpose in the last Pennsylvania
statute, the statute whereby secular educational services
were being purchased by the State, was to enhance, and I
quote, "the quality of the secular education in all schools
covered by the Compulsory Attendance Law."
Now, clearly, the State has a comprehensive and
pervasive interest in advancing the quality of secular
education in all schools, and that is clearly a legitimate
public purpose.

It is not the same purpose, it is nothing

like the purpose, set forth in Act 92,
Act 92 purports to have several purposes, several
that are secular and one that is clearly not? the several
that are secular, of course, is that it aims to make sure
that our public school classrooms do not get too overcrowded,
and that is an obviously appropriate purpose.

It aims to

keep a large tax load, an additional tax load off the back
of the public in Pennsylvania, and that is obviously a
legitimate purpose.
But it means to do this, and I read, sirs, from the
legislative finding, and what they say essentially is that
should parents of children now enrolled in non-public
schools be forced by economic circumstances to transfer any
substantial number of their children to public schools, it
would be an enormous additional burden to the taxpayer?

31
wherefore, that in order to reimburse parents partially for
this service so vitally needed by the Commonwealth,, this
Act is passed»
What is this service so vitally needed by the
Commonwealth?
It is the service, in quotes, "performed by parents
in sending their children to non-public schools" which, in
the main in Pennsylvania, are sectarian schools.,
So that the State, through the payment of money,
undertakes and in the purpose sets forth that that’s what its
intention is:

undertakes to encourage parents to keep their

children in the parochial schools so that they will not
overcrowd the public schools.
And I submit that in the evolving standards, and
this Court has said recently that these standards are evolving,
that this Court might note adopt the definition of "primary
purpose" used by Justice Frankfurter, concurring with Justice
Harlan, in the McGowan case.

And what he said there was that

if the primary end achieved by a form of regulation is the
affirmation or promotion of religious doctrine, primary in
the sense that all secular ends which it purportedly serves
are derivative from, and not wholly independent of, the
advancement of religion, then the regulation is beyond the
power of the State,
And I submit that whatever proper secular purposes

32

are found in the legislative finding are entirely derivative
from the improper sectarian purpose set forth in the legislative findings to which I have referred,.
And of course, coming to the second portion of our
argument, we say that this legislation is unconstitutional
in effect.

First of all, because, to the extent that it

effectuates its invalid purpose, of course it is unconstitu­
tional.
Appellants argue,and all of them have argued, that
since the money does not go to the school treasury but rather
to the parents, that this makes a difference,,
Professor Freund,

And we hold with

when he said, and I quote, "the sharp

dichotomy between pupil benefit and benefit to the school
seems to me a chimerical constitutional criteria."
chimerical indeed.

And

Because the question of whether the money

goes to the church or to the parent should not be, and X
don't think ever has been, the focal point of inquiry when
what we're trying to find is whether a legislative scheme
has a primary effect of advancing religions

Religion; not a

church.
And the First Amendment talks about religion; not a
church.
Of course, Tilton

—

QUESTION;

How about the Everson case?

MR. MANN;

The Everson case, sir, is probably the

33

only exception to the analysis I was about to make —
QUESTIONj Well, —
MR. MANNs

— and with Your Honor's permission,

because I think it's quite distinguishable? but in Tilton vs.
Richardson, of course, this Court made clear to all of us that
indeed a State can provide money directly to a church
institution, provided that the purpose is proper.
In the end, to determine whether the primary
effect of a lav/ advances religion, what must be examined is
the character of the aided activity.

That's what the lower

court said, and that's what this Court has said in the past.
And if we examine the character of the aided
activity in the recent cases decided by this Court, whether
it is secular textbooks, in Allen, provided to parochial
schools, or adding, giving 15 percent salary supplement to
secular teachers in religious schools, or whether the State
is purchasing secular subjects in math and science and foreign
language from the parochial schools? in every case, except
for Everson, which I will come to in just a moment, in every
case the character of the aided activity is primarily
secular education.
In every case, the character of the aided activity
is ideologically neutrale

Here what we're dealing with is a

legislative scheme which is reimbursing general tuition to
parochial education, and I don't see how we can argue with the

34

point that the character of the aided activity is parochial
education, which this Court has defined.

In Lemon and DiCenso,

this Court said the various characteristics of the schools
make them a powerful vehicle for transmitting the Catholic
faith to the next generation? and in the case of Jewish
parochial schools or Lutheran parochial schools, the identical
thing could be said.
And the Court went on to say, in short, parochial
schools involve substantial religious activity and purpose,
so that the point of the matter is that the character of the
aided activity under Act 92 is religious activity, and
therefore it is invalid.
The only exception, I think, to that kind of
analysis is Everson.

Because I think in Everson, although the

bus ride is ideologically neutral, it can, I think, more
accurately be said that the effect of reimbursing parents for
transporting their children to parochial schools comes closer
to being the primary effect which aids religion than any of
these other, more recent cases that I've noted.
But Everson is distinguishable not only because a
bus ride is non~ideological, it's distinguishable, too,
because there is a very finite point, a bus ride in terms of a
parochial school's budget can never account for more than a
small fraction, and if the legislative scheme is played out
to the end, it has, it comes to an end, and it comes to an end

35

early»
When we're talking about reimbursing tuition, we're
talking about reimbursing the total cost, really, of operating
a parochial school, there is no end.

If this Act is

constitutional, then v/hy not five times the amount?
But the — let me just close this portion of the
argument by saying it's clear to me that the State has no more
power to help a parent give his child a sectarian education
than it has to help a church give the children of its
parishioners a parochial education, because it's not a church
which the First Amendment forbids from being aided, it’s
religion*
QUESTION:

Well now, in both Everson and in Allen,

did the Court not say very explicitly that the fact that the
program, books in one case, bus rides in the other, encourages
more people to send their children to a church-related school
or private school is not controlling?
MR. MANN:
absolutely correct*

Yes, they did.

And I think the Court was

If a legislative scheme has an incidental

effect, such as Your Honor has described, that in itself is —■
I think what we're really dealing with is the definition of
primary effect*
The primary purpose of this legislation, however,
is to achieve all of its ends through purposely encouraging
as many parents as possible to keep all of their children in

36

a parochial school.,
That's a far cry from saying, well, just because a
piece of legislation might have an incidental effect of
encouraging somebody —
QUESTION: Well, the Attorney General, of course, put
it a little differently, perhaps not as roughly as I'm about
to restate it, but it was to keep as many as possible of the
children out of the overcrowded public schools.
MR. MANN:

I think it's two sides of the same coin.

I must say, the statistics I've read don't — I think
indicate that the overcrowded conditions of the public schools
are improving quite on their own without respect to this
problem in the last several years.

But I think they're

two sides of the same coin.
What the Legislature is trying to do is not get the
schools overcrowded by encouraging parents,purposely
encouraging parents, not incidentally? purposely, that's the
whole basis of the scheme, to continue to give their kids a
sectarian education»

And if that isn't violative of the

First Amendment, I don't know what is.
QUESTION: But can't you equally say that the purpose
is to continue to give their kids a private, non-public
education rather than a sectarian education?

Since I take

it it isn't dependent —
MR. MANN:

Yes, you can equally say that —

37

QUESTIONS

— on sectarian to get this reimbursement„

MR. MANNs

Yes, as a matter of fact, it's true that

the State — if 100 percent of the children went to non­
sectarian, private schools, the State’s purpose would be
accomplished in the same way; that is absolutely correct, sir.
Now —
QUESTION?

If it were 20 percent, to say that that

was a valid State purpose —
MR. MANN:

I'm sorry; I didn't hear you.

QUESTION:

Would it need to affect 100 percent of

this 20 percent — if 20 percent of these children are in
non-public schools.
MR. MANN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Now, must the program, in order to pass

muster on your view, cover all of the 20 percent?
MR. MANN: V7ell, if ~
QUESTION: What if half, that is 10 percent, were in
private, secular schools and half in sectarian schools?
»

MR. MANN:

In terms of whether it passes constitu­

tional muster on the primary effect test, I don't think it
makes any difference whether 50 percent of the kids are going
to private, non-sectarian, and 50 percent to private sectarian,
or whatever the percentage is,.

I don't think it makes any

difference.
In terms of passing constitutional muster on the third

38

test that has been announced by the Court, the question of
political divisiveness, which I will come to in a few moments,
I think it makes all of the difference in the world.
One of the arguments that Mr. Ball has made is that
— all the appellants have made, and we've heard it all day
today — is that there is somehow a difference here because the
parents are getting the money at the end of the school year,
and they may spend it for a vacation or for a down payment on
a car, any way they want.

And it's just like any other

so the argument goes -- it's just like any other general
purpose, general welfare legislation.
I want to address myself to that directly.

Before

I do, I want to address myself to it factually, because I
think it is factually incorrect, although none of us, myself
included, have made this point in our briefs.
This is not a true tuition reimbursement law.

If

Your Honors will look at the Appendix, pages 60 and 61, which
contains the Act, it says that to become eligible to receive
this reimbursement, $150 for a high school child, $75 for an
elementary school child, the parent must produce and show to
the authority a receipted tuition bill or a copy of an
executed contract, under which the student attended the nonpublic school.
And in the next paragraph, when it talks about
receiving the money, the amount a parent receives, the parent

39

receives the lesser of $150 or, and I quote, "the actual
amount of tuition paid or contracted to be paid by a parent".
Well, let's understand the legislative scheme.

It

is not at all necessary for a parent to have paid this tuition
and then at the end of the year get it back from the State.
The parent need only execute a contract at the beginning of
the school year; at the end of the school year he must only
show the contract, and upon showing the contract he gets his
$150 and then he may or may not pay his overdue tuition bill.
But I wouldn't want this case to go off on that
factual difference.

But I wanted to make the point, because

it seems clear to me that even if this were a true tuition
reimbursement bill, it isn't so much the receipt of money by
a parent for last year's attendance, which encourages that
parent to send his child to parochial school next year;
indeed, in the case of a high school senior at a parochial
school, that's not so at all.

The parent gets the money for

the twelfth grade, at the end of the twelfth grade; and he's
not going to use that money for the parochial education of
his child.
But it seems to me that's not pertinent.

It is in

fact the promise of reimbursement made by the State at the
beginning of the school year, when the parent is deciding
whether to go to a — to send his child to a public or
parochial school.

It's through that promise, the statutory

40

premise, by which Pennsylvania is encouraging parents to send
or to continue to send their children to non-public schools
which, in the main in Pennsylvania, are sectarian schools.
This is nothing like general welfare legislation.
Of course the recipient of a Social Security check can decide
to use it to send his grandchild to a parochial school.
The recipient of an Unemployment Compensation check can turn
it over to his parish priest*
QUESTION! So your argument remains much the same if
Pennsylvania said, We will give you half your tuition but
never any more?
MR. MANN:

Yes, sir*

By all means*

3y all means,

I —
QUESTION!

Although, to the extent that his entire

tuition is paid, you say necessarily, then, the State is
financing that part of the education, that that is religious
also?
MR. MANN! Well, clearly here, where the State may be
paying the entire tuition, because of less than — if the
entire tuition is $150, the child gets $150.
I understood Your Honor to be asking the question!
What if the statute said never more than half the tuition,
and made a legislative finding that at least half of the
budget of the parochial school was spent for secular educational
purposes

41
QUESTIONi

Your argument would remain much the

same?
MR. MANNs

My argument would remain the same, yes,

QUESTION?

And your constitutional argument would

sir,,

be the same if it was ten dollars?
MR. MANN;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, it makes no

difference at all.
QUESTION; Then the differences in the Everson case
and the Allen case, textbooks and buses, what about that?
MR. MANN;

I'm not —

QUESTION:

Well, then you are in trouble with

Everson, aren’t you?
MR. MANN:

Well, I don’t know that I’m so much in

trouble —
tLaughter.]
MR. MANN;

As you know, any attempt, sir, to take

all of the Court's previous decisions and apply them in a
symmetrical way to every Church-State case that comes before
the Court is going to meet with some trouble.

And I'll grant

Justice White that.
But I think the Everson case gives me some problems,
it gave the Court problems, and, as I understand it, some of
those who voted in favor of it that now sit on this Court
have indicated that if they had to do it over again they

42
wouldn't„
The point of the matter, of course, is that Your
Honor, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, in the Lemon-DiCenso case,
said that Everson, a decision which was thought to take us to
the verge of constitutional permissibility really began us on
what might be a downhill thrust.

And, as I understood the

context in which Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice was talking
in that case, it was an effort to say we've got to be careful
in each decision as to where it's going to lead us.
And Everson, I think, led the Court, led the society
into a great many legislative schemes that have had to pass
constitutional muster or failed to pass constitutional muster
before this Court before.
I was making the point just a moment ago that the
difference between the fellow who gets his Unemployment
Compensation check and turns it over to his church, and the
parent who gets reimbursement here, is that that fellow who
gets his Unemployment Compensation check didn't get it because
he performed some religious act or did something that
advanced religion, he got it for entirely different reasons,
and is free to use it as he will.
But Judge Lord, in the lower court here, I think was
precisely correct when he defined this issue by saying it is
whether individuals may receive State funds solely because
they have paid tuition at a church-related school.

43

If I may paraphrase what the Court said in LemonDiCenso, if Rhode Island may not supplement teachers' salaries
without being certain that those teachers do not teach
religion, then it seems to me, a fortiori, that Pennsylvania
may not reimburse tuition to parochial school parents when
they are absolutely certain that that tuition is being used to
advance and to teach religion,
QUESTION: What about a returning veteran who has not
had a high school education and goes to a Catholic high school
at age 18?
MR. MANN:

What I am reminded of, sir, is some of

the Court's opinions or concurring opinions, or dissenting
opinions, I don't remember now,which years ago used to cite
Bible reading in the public schools, which had not yet been
declared unconstitutional, as saying: Well, how about Bible
reading in the public schools?

We've been doing that for

years, so doesn't it justify the next process.
And of course when Bible reading in the public
schools finally came before the Court, it was unanimously
declared unconstitutional,

I only make that point to say that

I don't believe that the G. I, Bill of Rights has ever come
before this or any other court on First Amendment grounds,
I am not suggesting which way it should go, if it should come
here, and I hope it doesn't come here.
But it seems to me that — and, by the way, that is

44
saying something significant, too,

I think that since the

G» I, Bill has been in effect for so many, many, many years,
and nobody has ever challenged it, indicates that it's something
that the society has fully accepted and will not, and would
never, cause the political divisiveness that some other types
of legislation will, such as this.
It seems to me that to take — there are distinctions,
of course; but to take the kind of statute that a nation
passes after a war, in which it feels it owes so much to those
people who fought the war for them, and say we’re going to
repay this by making your education possible, here's the
money, spend it any way you will, but for education; it seems
to me that that is not precedent for anything that we have
before the Court today.
I mentioned a moment ago — well, I have reached
the point in ray argument and, if I may, it’s the last point
in my argument, it’s political entanglement, and I want to
spend a few moments on it, with tile Court’s permission, and
I will close.
If this legislation were validated, it seems to me
that all of the fears expressed by the Founding Fathers and
Justices of this Court, Justice after Justice, of divisiveness
along religious lines, sect against sect, each sect attempting
to use whatever political muscle it can garner to get its
fair share of the pie, deal-making between sects in order to

45

get that muscle, all of those fears, it seems to me,
realistically would spring back to life again.
And our political process would be corrupted, and,
I submit, our religions would be demeaned,
Mr. Ball has said in his reply brief that that is a
constitutionally malevolent argument, that to permit blacks
and other groups within the society to seek financial aid of
various sorts, for various reasons, but not permit parochial
school advocates to do the same thing is

constitutionally

malevolent.
And I suppose that it's true that every effort by
any group in the society to obtain funding is opposed, in a
society as large as ours, by some other group and to that
degree, of course, is divisive.
But Mr. Chief Justice Burger made it abundantly
clear in Lemon-PiCenso that the attempt to obtain funding for
religious purposes has always been meaner, has always been
more divisive, and is likely to strain a society like ours
to the breaking point.
Court said:

And that is why, in Schempp, this

the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to

withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political
controversy, religion being one of them? they depend on the
outcome of no elections.

And the Court went on to say that

religious freedom was first in the Bill of Rights because it
was first in the forefathers' minds, and it was set forth in

46

absolute terras and its strength is its rigidity.
So that when the appellants are offended by the
political divisiveness argument, their quarrel is not with me
and is not with the Court, it is with the very underpinnings
of the First Amendment; and I take it we do not have before
us today the question of whether it ought be repealed»
The point is, if I may for just a moment, it's
difficult to talk about even a little bit of history before
this Court, which has expressed so much on it.

The point is

that we were an enormously diverse people in the first place,
and that’s why we made the separation experiment and Europe
did not.

It was an American experiment, because, you know,

it strikes me that Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, they
weren't the only two gentlemen who understood in their bones
that when the power of religion — when religion is backed by
the power of government, that it corrodes both processes,
government and religion.
Their European contemporaries must have known it
better than they, but they didn't experiment with separation,
we did.

And why did we?

Because we were nation-building, and

we were building a nation of diverse religions and ethnic
groups.
And it's not a question of ancient history, as Mr.
Ball implied in his brief, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Justice Brennan
pointed out in his separate Schempp opinion, that our

47
religious composition in this country today is far more
diverse than it was several hundred years ago.

And I think

that the point must be made, that there is an enorxaous
unity that inheres in a European society which, for a thousand
or two thousand years, has shared a common soil, developed a
common language, undergone common terrible trauma, a unity that
we didn’t have two hundred years ago, and which I suggest
contemporary events can lead us all to believe we still don't
have.
So, perhaps Europe survived the strains of
establishment, but we couldn’t.
forefathers that we couldn’t.

The judgment was made by the
And that is what I think Justice

Frankfurter was saying in McCollum when he saids

the great

American principle of eternal separation is one of the vital
reliances of our system for assuring unities greater than our
diversities.
Given an already — well, let me conclude.
This legislation, Act 92, I don’t understand the
distinction between this situation and Wolman vs. Essex, I
don't understand this argument about annual appropriations,
because there really is not the slightest doubt that this law,
the identical, if validated, would come up year after year
after year — not in some administrative body where, after all,
there isn't much entanglement, but in the Legislature of
Pennsylvania where there is a great deal, there is no reason

48

in the world to believe that $150 per high school child and
$75 is the end of the road.
Your Honor, Hr. Chief Justice Burger noted in Lemon
vs. DiCenso about that Pennsylvania law — Lemon vs„ Kurtzman,
about that Pennsylvania law passed in '68, that under it $5
million a year went to parochial, to non-public schools, most
of which were parochial,
I call to Your Honors' attention that that law was
invalidated in June of 1971; that this law was passed less
than two months later; that Attorney General Packel has noted
in his brief that under this law up to $75 million will be
paid to parents of non-public school children.

A 15-fold

increase in several years.
It reminds me of Mr. Chief Justice Burger's comment
in Walz that if tax exemption can be seen as the first step
in the establishment of religion, then the second step has
been long in coming.

That may very well be in respect of tax

exemption; it most certainly is not in respect of aid to
sectarian education.
The second step came within two months, and it was a
15-fold increase.
QUESTION?

Mr. Mann, what's the balance of the

cigarette tax go to?
MR, MANNs

I'm not sure.

QUESTION: Do you know?

49
The Attorney General does know --

MR, MANN:
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:
MR. MANN:

It’s 77 percent.
A 77 percent balance.

I don't know

where — it goes for other purposes, and I don't know what
they are.
QUESTION:

Well, what did this —* where did this 23

percent of the tax used to go?
MR. MANN:

I believe — oh, let me — I can’t answer

that, because I believe, but I am not certain, that the 1968
law that was invalidated by this Court —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. MANN:

— was initially funded through the

harness racing recipts.

And then was funded by the cigarette

tax, which I think was increased for that purpose; but I'm
really not certain, and I'm not helping the Court by -QUESTION:

I was going to ask you if there had been

an increase in the tax.
MR, MANN:

I think there was, but I'm not sure.

I'm sorry.
I want to simply say this, on political entanglement,
and then I will sit down.
In the lower court I was joined by amici, who joined
in ray brief, many, one of them was the State Council of
Churches, which is organized, mostly organized Protestantism

50

in Pennsylvania? another was Pennsylvania Jewish Community
Relations Conference# which i3 most of organized Jewry in
Pennsylvania»

And I have to ask myself# take Protestantism#

for example# because I think this comes to the nub of it# I
think we have to deal with it# why shouldn't Protestantism be
bitter# angry# and frustrated when legislation like this comes
up for consideration and is indeed passed?
This legislation represents an enormous change# if
I may say it this way, in the rules of the game»

After one

side has committed itself to the old rules and has changed
its position irretrievably? by that I mean that it*s 130 years
ago when every State in the Union already had# as part of
its fundamental law# that the State could not support
sectarian education.

All those cards were on the table#

everybody knew that, and at that point in time Protestant
America decided to let its religious schools become public
schools, and Catholic America decided to start on the process
of building the great and complex parochial school system
that it has today.
For the government to come along, 130 years later#
and say, Now we're going to begin funding sectarian education#
is, it seems to me, the grossest kind of interference

of

government in the competition between creeds, which Justice
Douglas, in Zorach# said that in that competition between
creeds# the government must be absolutely neutral

51
This isn't some peripheral thing we’re talking about?
we're talking about parochial education? which this Court has
said, and which many educators have said, is singularly the
most effective way of passing on a religious heritage from
one generation to another»
For the State to come along and begin to support
only those religions, and there are a number of them, which
have parochial schools, but none of the religions, and this is
most of them, which do not have parochial schools is laying
the heavy hand of government on that competition, and for that
reason will cause enormous and has caused enormous
divisivenesso
And for all of these reasons, I respectfully request
the Court to affirm the judgment of the court below*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, Mr, Mann,

Your friends have three minutes remaining and, Mr,
Ball, do you wish to use that?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BENTLEY BALL, ESQs,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS DIAZ, ET AL.
MR. BALL:
MR. REATH:
MR, BALL:

May it please the Court*
May I have thirty seconds?
I’ll save you thirty seconds, Mr, Heath»

Mr, Mann spoke first of all about the character of

52

the aided activity.

The aided activity here, in spite of

every effort to call the aided activity a parochial school,
the aided activity here is an act of will of the parent.
I don't believe the bridge was crossed.

We have

talked about conduit throughout this case, but nothing that
Mr. Mann said, in spite of all appeals to questions concerning
religious controversy, got him across that legal point.
Nothing can change the Act.
The Act in fact does grant money to individuals who
have total disposition over that money.
His whole case depends on the conduit, except for
his remarks concerning religious divisiveness.
Now, I beg the Court, where is there a record of
this?

It is fine to talk about what no historical research

supports the Founding Fathers as having said.
But we have to live in today's day, and when we
look at the record, which the plaintiffs could have made
below, which they neglected to make below, where is the
religious divisiveness?

Does it consist in the fact that

some people decide to go into the forum and make a religious
issue out of something?
We didn't even have it in spite of the intervention
of religious groups in their own names in Pennsylvania,

We

have shown we have been willing to show that the record, the
4

voting record was on both sides of the aisle in favor of this

53
Act and opposed to this Act; that Jews, Protestants and
Catholics voted against the Act, voted for the Act,

There's

absolutely no foundation for this perfectly ludicrous charge
of a holy war going on in Pennsylvania.
The G. I. Bill of Rights is perfectly justified in
the same way that this Act is justified»

Certainly people

could have made a religious issue out of it, two thousand
people were educated at divinity schools under a G„ I, Bill of
Rights which at that time required that the check go directly
to the school.
You can't violate the Constitution because somebody
is coming back from war.

If that Act which was generally

accepted, just as the Pennsylvania Act is generally accepted,
if that Act were unconstitutional, it would be a very strange
thing in our history.

It was broadly accepted, just as this

Act is being broadly accepted today among the people of the
State, in real life, in actual Pennsylvania.
I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Reath.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY T. REATH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT CROUTER
MR. REATHs

If Your Honors please, just to supplement

what Mr. Ball said in response to Mr. Mann's statement about
the character of the aided activity:
He said the character of the aided activity was

54

parochial education»

I submit there's not a scintilla of

evidence in the record to support it.
To the contrary, the parent gets the money not
because he sends his child to a parochial school but because
t

he has assisted the State in meeting the State's requirement
for compulsory education»
Secondly, with respect to political divisiveness,
I agree, again, there is nothing in the record? and,
furthermore, I would point out that Mr. Chief Justice in the
Lemon and Tilton cases, when he spoke of political divisiveness
there, we're dealing again with the problem of aid to an
institution, where the institution had an ongoing call for
the funds, here you have payment to a parent? a parent is an
individual person.

He has individual constitutional rights

and one of those rights is the right of free speech, the
right of freedom of petition, the right to go to his legis~
lative assembly and say, I want this because I'm entitled to
it.
I think the difference again highlights the
essential distinction between payment to a parent, which we
have here, and payment to institutions, which we had in
Lemon v„ Kurtzman„
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
