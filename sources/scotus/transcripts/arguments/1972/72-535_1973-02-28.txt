MR. GRIS\IOLD:

nP..y

it please the Court.:

Those cases are here on appeal from the dec:~sion
of a 3-judge court in the District. Court for the District of
Columbia.

T~e suit was brought there to set. aside an order

of the Inter:'lt;,.te Comr.1erc9 Commission and it involves quest.1.ons
under the Interstate Commerce Act, t.he Uat.ional Environmental
Policy Act., and other int.errelated questions.
I am representing the Unit~d States and the Interstate CollUllsrGe Commission. !1r. Cox is repras-enting the
appellant railroads in No. 72-562.

we

have filed separate

briefs, but there is no divergence between our positions.
The setting of the stage for this case began in
Decembe:: 1971 when the nation's railroads requested special
permission f~om the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize
on short notice a 2.5 percent surcharge on nearly all freight
rates across the board.
on January l, 1972.

They asked that this be effective

The Commission disallowed this request.

5

on tJ1a ground that there was inadequate notice, but it allowed
the carriers to refil~ the proposal t.o be eff~ctivc on not
less tl,an 30 days notice.

And the carriers did .ccf.ile on

January 5, 1972, asking that the 2.5 percent surcharge beco,n<?
effective on Pebruary 5.
Under Section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act, a
rate proposed by a carrier becomas effective unless the
Commission suspends it within 30 days.

Arul this suspension

pending an investigation under SEction 15(7) is effective
for a maximum p'i!r.iod of 7 months, after which the carrier
may put the rate into effect unless the Comn1ission prior to
that date has completed its investigat.ion and affirmatively
found that the proposed rate is unlawful.
In this case, during the 30-day period, protests
were filed by shippers and other interested parties,and
environmental groups, including the named appellee here
s.c.R.A.P.,opposed the surcharge on the ground that the
prevailing rate structure discourages the movement of
recyclable goods and that an across-the-board surcharge would
further discourage recycling.
The Commission found that the railroads had a
crit.ical need for additional revenue and concluded that. the
proposed surcharge should not be suspanded.

It. ordered the

carriers, however, to Publish p<lrmanent. incr'!lased rates no
later than June 5, 1972, and provided that. the authority to

G

collect the 2.5 percont. surcharg~ would ,;ixpire ".'Int-hat dat9.
'l'he Conmission also spacifically fou:1d tJ1at the
temporary surcharge wou:!.d <1pp!c.ar to have no significant
a<lv'!rse effects on the environment within the meaning of the
Environmental Policy Act.

i\r.d there w~.s evidenc'! b<:1fore the

Commission to support that finding.
Th'! carriers then filP-cl proposo,d s~l-!ctive increases
averaging 4.l perc!lnt an.J protests were filed.

On April 24,

1972, the Commission .instit-uted an inv'lsti Jat-ion into t-he

lawfulness of the selective incr•ias<c!s ilnd .msp•.n<l-:i.. tb"'n
for tha st:a1tutory 7-m.:m•·11 period uncl~r S:?c'i:·ion 15 (7).

At

tlH! same tim!l it authoriz~d bie railroad,i ..o con.. inu!:l to
coll~ct 2.5 ">ercc.,nt surcharg'! until th!! end oft-he susp9nsion
period which was Uovumber 30, 1972.
A fe.,.. days later, on !lay 12, 1972, this suit. was
filed by s.c.n.A.P.

And on June l, the Environment.al

Defense Fund and other environmental groups intervened as
plaintiffs.

Various defenses to the suit w".lr9 advanced, but

these w,;ire rejected by the District Court..
On July 10, 1972, that court. entered an injunction
uy which the Interstate Conruerce Commission is restrained
from pannit.ting the railroads to collect t..i1e surcharge and the
railroaus are enjoined from collecting it insofar as it
relates to goods being transported for purposes of recycling.
As

r"!sult, th•'\ surcharge is not now being collected on

7

recyclaule materials.

the legal issues.

:m. GIUS\lvLD:

there are still five--proceeJing net as lawyers but as
plaintiffs, though modest taxpayers, have tied up all the
railroad!! in t.he coun-crl' and with the aid of the District
Court have prevGnted t·h.;: ratlroads from collecting $500,000
to a million dollars a month for t.he past 8 months on shipments
of recyclable materials.

Th'!y have be'!n joined by several

environment.al groups, but the latter make r.o different
allegations and tlle case may be treated on the basis of the
position relied on by s.c.R.A.P.
Just last '.rhursday, t.he District. Court. did grant a
motion to intervene by the National Association of Secondary
:taterial Industries which is an organization which has fileJ
a brief amicus curiae in this Court, the light green amicus
curiae.
and

\I'!

Th<i! order wasn't filed with the cl"3rk until Friday,
didn't hear about it until !10r.day. I don ' t think that

has any relation to the case which is panding before the

Court. or. appeal, and in any event i'lsofar as th<:1se people are
shippers, they 11ould appear t.o be cl-early not <mtitled to
tl1e

equitable relief which is the only tl1ing involved h<:1re.

After all, this is an appeal from the granting of a preliminary
injunction because they would have a plain and ad')quato remedy
at law by way of ravii;w of the rate order of the Co.,unission.
The allegations of S.C.R.J\.P. appear at. pages 8 t'.>
10 of the appendix, particularly on th<:1 bottom half of. page 9.

They

allege that aach member of s.c.n.r,.P., 'llthough we

now havq some ne'I-; 1.1e:,:il.>')rs wh-:> apparantly have not formally
joined in this pet.it.ion, each mE'..mber of s.c.R.A.P. has
been caused to

(i)

pay more for finished products purchased in the

mar,.etplace, made more expensive by both the non-use of
recycled materials in their manufacture, and the need to use
comparatively more energy in the reduction of a raw material
t.o finished products; and
(ii) Uses the forests, rivers, streams, mountains,
and other natural resources surrounding the Washington
J.tetropolitan area and at his legal residence, for camping,
hiking, fishing, sightseeing, and other recreational or
aesthetic purposes.
And pc:ss!ng to the t.hird,

.low, it will be seen that these all-"!gat.ions are
entirely general.

It is net said which [crests, rivers,

streams, or mountains.

We don't even havs a p«rticular valley

Did the District Court take testimony

on this

No,

:tr. Justica, the District court.

not. only <lidn' t. f-.ake tast.imony, but. there is no svidence to
support the standing,and t11e position of S.C.R,A.P. in their
m::>tion to dismiss is that such evidence was unnec'!!ssary.
District court. didn't re.quire any proof even of these
allega'i:ions, and quoting from their motion t.o affirm,s.c.R.A.P.
said that. proof of its injuries is unnecessary for the purpose
of st.anding, and it also said t.hat. it was -- and I am quoting
that it was obvious-- that's their word -- that s.c.R.A.P.
could not

and I quote -- prove the amount of addit~onal

pollution in the \lashington, D.

c.

area created by the

latest. ICC railroad rate increase.
QUESTION:

liho in your opinion would have standing?

rm. GRISl-lOLO:

The shippers whos-e rates were

increased would have standing.

I'm not sure that anyone would

h3ve s~anding t.o obtain an injunction in this case.

11

'£hat's a quest.ion which interr"ll,.tes 11i.t-h the In+-erst.ate
Commerce Co:nmission argument that ar. cox is going t.o make.
There are tl1use tl1at feel th.it standing is no longer a
relevant argument, though I wonder if our predecessors were
always that. wrong.
In another case Judge Gazelle in this district a
few years ago said in reccmt years the Suprent: Ccurt. has
greatly expanded the concept of standing and in this circuit
the concept. has now been almost completely abandoned,

And

similarly in a recent articl'3 in i.-l1e Cincinnat..i L<1w Review,
the author c.::>ncludes w.ith this statement., "'l'h· law would be
so much bat.tar if the courts got. directly on the task of
decidi:ig th.e merits of t.he clair.1:? presented without passing
on the merits of the plaintiff presenting them."
!1011,

there is a cert.ain simple appeal in that and

it may represent the wave of the future.

But it's a serious

step, the implicat·ions of which should be carefully explored
and considered.
Before going further, I may observe that if there
is st.anding in this case, it would be helpful, I think, and
a contribution to candor if this Court. would indicate that
standing is no longer required

or t.o say that st.anding is

required and that. there is st.anding in this casCJ.
QUE5TlOH: \iould the United St.ates have standing,
··tr. Solicitor General?

12

HR. GRIS',lOLD:

Yes, I think so,

i•lr.

Justice, the

United States has standing to enforce tha laws of thP. United
States.

And a State might well have standing.
QUESTION:

l'lould the United Stat9s hav'! standing

if it alleged it's moving to enforc~ tJ1e Bnvirorun'lntal
Protection Act?
IIR. GRISIIOLD:

Hell, I think there are many &ituation,,;

under which th,;i Unit,ed St~tes would 11av".? stunding to enforce
matters relating to environmental protection, par~icularly
in vi~1·1 of the statute which Congress sr.act,ro stating the
policy of th:1 United States.
QUESTIOi~:

A person in the busingss of recycling,

,,~1 some companies are, would they have st.anding?
HR. GRISNOLD:

i\

p9rson who had a business interest

would have standing, yes.
QUESTIOU:

It comes down to the dollar business.

an. GRISWOLD:
QUESTJ.ON:

I am sorry, 11r. Justice?

It comes down to the dollar --

rn~. GRISWOLD:

No, I don't think it would be

limited to a dollar amount as in Sierra Club v. l!orton in
the opinion by llr. Justice Stewart.

It- was recognized that

aesthetic interests could affect it, as, for exampl'!!, a
person who owns a pi.ece of land and in violation of an
environmental statute his view is going to be obst.ruct'~d,
even though it might not have a -- it just happened to be a

•

13

sentiment.al view tl1at he had reason to like.
him.

13ut it affects

It isn't something that. deals with th<? pul>lic in

general.
Standing is not a fiction and niwer has bean and
should not be.

If anyon•'!l has standing to bring a suit like

t.;1is, it will mark a substantial shift in the l>alancP. under
our traditional and constitutional separation of powers.
this is what. the Constitution meant. by cases
to which the judicial power is eY.tend'9d.

For

or controversies

If everyon'.! is a

private Attorney G~neral free to raise any public question
at his whim or because of his academic or abstract interest,
more and more questions will be thrown into the courts and
we can readily have a situation where every facet. of our
goverrunent.al OIY<lration depends on the let or hindrance of the
courts where in effect. t.he courts would take over all tJ1e
details

of t.he administration of the government..

In my view

that would not be good for the courts, it would not be good
for the country.
Perhaps more pertinent, it's not the sort of division
of function which was intended by t.he framers as I see it
when they established the Constitution.

I don't want to

argue another case, but this Court. last ttonday granted
certiorari in United St.ates v. Richardson which is a clear
illustration of the type of quest.ion which will arise if
there is standing in a case like this.

14
:Ct may seem very fine to some to<ley to have the

courts d-:acide all the legal questions, oft<:!n pretty Much in
advance and in the absence of concrete facts as is th-a
s!tuation h<:!rs.

ror the courts today are progressive and

forward-looking and innovative.
so.

nut it has not always been

Thar,; have been times whsn th<? courts werF. felt by

r.i.ariy

to be backward looking and obstructive and cerious attacks
on the courts have occurred.
Of ccu.rse, the courts should do their duty.

They

shouL..l ,ixercise tl19ir judicial power without fear or ':'avor.
But the judicial power does not authorizP. a ')'c!neral overriding
sort of oversight. of all leg:il questions arising i!, t·he
governr:1ent, a sort of ombudsman to 1-lhO'J a.11 may resort wh,m
they f.z:al so impelled.

It was for this reason that th,.

judicial power was a:,t,•.mdoo to casqs or controversies, and
that should mean tona fide disputes by a party who has a
r!l!al stake and who can show how he has been hurt.

That is

not this case with r-asp<?Ct to any of th'! appellees.
I turn now to one of the substantive quest.ions in
this case, namely, the proper interpretation oft.he National
Environmental Policy Act. and its application to the action of
the ICC which has been

er,joined here.

lie st.art with a

procedure long established by the Interstate Commerce Act-.
As indicated in ths previous case and as I have said, the
Commission is given !.>road po11':lr to suspend propossd rates, but

15

it has only 30 days within which to take this action, and
uncler Section 15(7) it has only 7 nonths after suspension to
act on the proposed rates.

If the Cotv:1ission has not acted

witJ1in 7 months, tl1.? new rats.s go into ,:iffect.
On January 1, 1970, the President. signad the
1,at ional J::nvironment.al Pol.icy Act.

This is ob,iously a

statute of great importance '=Stablishing a clearly stated
pul>lic policy, and it is obviously to be t .al~en seriously by
all a,Jencies of the Government..
but rather general tsrms.

It. was enact.eJ in sweeping

The Act. esta.blished a Council on

I;nvironmental Qualit.y with explicit. duties in th'! areas of
reoearch and investigation int.o -environmental quality.

And

the Council has issued guidelines under the Act. which are
set out. at pages 4 3 to 54 of our brief.
l.lut tl1e Council has no administrative responsibilit.ies.
It decides no cases and issues no orders to agencies or
parties, and ther~ is no provision in the statute for
judicial review of any action or non-act.ion.

I am not

suggesting that there can't be judicial r-eview.

I am really

obsarving that the statute, though sweeping, is not.
particularly articulate.

It. is cast. in very general terms

and obviously requires some

construing.

When we look at t.ha environment stat.ut.e it.self,
Sect.ion 102(2) (C) ,which is on page 42 of our brief, we find
that it- applies to legislative proposals which are not.

16

involved her a.
act.ions."

And t.ho;m the key words arc "m3jor Fed<:!ral

1-lajor Federal actions, if they are ones "significantly

affecting the quality of t.hs human environment."

Thus we havt3

at the threshold two phrases which require the consideration
of this Court.

There is another phrase at. the beginning of

Section 102 that. I will mention lat.~, "t.o the fullest extent
possible."

And it seems to me in large measure part of this

case turns on the construct.ion which this Court gives to
those tl1ree phrases.
There is nothing i.-ri tha statute which limits thes9
phrases to any particular agencies or types of agencies.

For

example, literally the st.atut.e applies t.o decisions of this
court ar.d, aft.er all, this court is a Federal agency and if
this Court takes an act.ion it. can ,,-ell be a major Federal
action.

If so construed, it ,..ould require the court to issu<?

an environmental inpact. statement. after consult..ing all
interested Fede.:cal agencies before making any decision which
could affect. t.l1e er.vironment., and under the regulations of
tl1e Council on ~nvironment.al Quality, this process could take
at laast four months, probably a good deal longer.

As I have

said, what. this court does is oft.en a major Federal act.ion
and what it does may affect. the environment:.

For example,

this Court's decision in this case or in the last term the
Sierra Club case or in a case involving school busing at
least arguably may have a significant environmental effect.•

17

now, I hasten to make it plain that I don't think
th'? statute should be construed to apply to the decisions of
t.his Court.

But I do suggest. that reaching that. result tak'!s

soml! construing.

In tl1e light of the whole setting, it is

right and sound, I think, to conclude tl1at by the words
"major Federal actions" in the st.at.uta Congress did not mean
to include decisions of this Court, though there is no
definition of Federal agency or anything like that which
e:ccludes this Court, '!Ven though they are obviously Federal
action and may often be major.
If the st-at.ut.e is susceptible to such a limitation,
and I tl,ink it is and must be, then it. becomes necP.ssary to
consider the statute in its application in other settings.
Our submission is that. as a matt.er of statutory construction,
the National Environmental Policy Act was not intended t.o
displace the Interstate Commerce Act when the application of
NEPA is not feasible int.he light oft.he scheme for prompt.
action established by the Commerce Act.
most straining of the statutory language.

T~is result requires
Sect.ion 102 it.self

starts out. with the provision that the policies of NEPA are
to be appli"?d to the fullest. extent possible. where as a

practical matt.er the application of the HEPA procedures is not.
possible because of the time limitations

in

th'! operative

statute,NEPA should not be const'rued t-o require it.
QUESTIOll:

Is this the Commission's curr9nt position

18

on the applicability of NEPA?
HR. GRISWOLD:

As to suspension orders, yes, ; Ir.

Justice.
Qtri:STIOll:

I see.

!1R. GRISWOLD:
QUESTIOU:

,~ot as to the --

Not as to their iinal act.ion.

:,m. GRISWOLD:
QUESTIO:~:

But. not as --

l,ot as to their final act.ion.

They figure that in the cours!l of the

investigation and the decision

;.m. GRISWOLD:

Then t.hey will develop the materials

which as a part. of their final action will include an
appropriate environmental protection stat.ement.

The Commission

doas not take the position that NEPA is never applicable to
the Commission, only that it is not applicable to suspension
orders which must be acted on within 30 days.
QUESTION:

I suppose ·they take the same position

whether t.h1:1y do suspend the rates or don't..

im. GRISllOLD:

Whether they do or do not., they must

do one or the other within 30 days.

If the commission doesn't

act within 30 days, the new rat.e goes into effect.

If

Saction 102(2) (C) is applicable, it. requires the preparation
of an elaborat.e environmental impact statement, the elaboration
of which is apparent. from the material in the statut.e on
page 43 of our brief which I won't take time to read but which
shows that. it is a very large undertaking.

19

The guidelines issued by the Council which were
suggested in tl1e Committee reports of both llouaes of Congress
is not something that tl1a Council made overly elaborate.
The guidelines indicate that environmental impact statements
should be issued in t.wo stages.
prepared by the ag9ncy involved.

First, a draft should ba
Then it's provided in the

statute it. should be reviewe<l by other agencies, Federal,
St.ate and local, which have opecial interests or expertise.
The Council suggests th;:it 90 days be allowed for this process.
The draft is also available to citizens for comment..

The

agency then prepares a final stat.em,mt. in the light of all the
comm-?nts it rec:aived.

It then issues a st-at~m-ent. and makes

it available to tl1e Council on Environmental Quality and the
public.

It's not to take any administrative action for 30

days thgreafter.

In making the statement it is further

enjoined by statute in very comprehensive t.erms which appear
at t.he bottom of page 33 and top of page 34 of our brief.
It's required to utilize a systematic interdisciplinary
approach which will ensure the integrated use of th9 natural
and social sciences and the environmental design arts in

man's environment.
QUESTION:

Does it define t.hat last phrase

"environ.'llental arts"?

zm.

GRISWOLD:

No, Ur. Chief Just.ice, "environmental

20
design arts" is not defined.
QUES'l.'ION:

What would that apply to?

Buildings and

highways, I suppose.
UR. GRISIJOLD:

It applies to anytl1ing to which it

applies, Hr. Chief Justice.

It's in very broad and swaaping

terms.

QUES'J.'ION:

That. would m-aan an attack on a propos':lcl

building because someone thought the design of tl1e building
was bad.
llR. GRISWOLD:

That. argument no doubt will b'3 r.1ad~

under this statute at soma point.
QUESTION:

Well, here, relatively speaking, the

determination of the Commission was to do nothing, wasn't it?
It was to not. suspend.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Almost., Mr. Just.ice.

That is the

position of tl1e Commission that. that's what. th'3y did.

Actually,

what they did was to say, "Ile will not suspend it, but you
roust within a fixed t.ime propose permanent rates and we will
than terminate the suspension wh911 your Pf!rman'l!nt. rates go
into effect."
So it was a conditional non-suspension.

It wasn't

sir.iply, "We don't. suspend," uhich would have put the 2.5
percent. increase into effect.
The Commission has to consider suspension orders
in approximately 4,000 cases a year.

The Commission was

21

obviously confront'3<1 with the task of determining its duty
in the

light of the two statutes t.aknn together.

Dy

its

own terms NEPA is applicable only to actions siqnificantly
affecting the quality of the hum'.ln environment.

/,nd in this

case the Commission ma<le a specific finding thnt the proposed
across-the-board temporary surch~rge "will have no significant
advarse effect on thi~ quality of the human environment."
The court below said t.hat this finding appears to be
no more

than glorified boiler plat.3.

Perhaps this did not

adequately recognize the commission's experience in the field
no:: its standing as a coordinate agency of the Government
seeking to comply with its duty under provisions of two
statutes which are surely not wholly clear in their interrelations.
Now, it's obvious that. NEPA can't be complied with
fully witl1in 30 days.

The a)?pelleos suggest that since the

enact.mant of NEPA, the Commission should always suspend new
rates until an environmental impact statement has bMn prepared
and filed.

But as the Second Circuit has point.ed out.,

sometimes suspension has environmental implications.

If, for

example, the railroads should be so impaired t.hat they have
to abandon soma of their services, the very things that the

appallees ars concerned about might come into operation.
QUESTION:

Do

you say, Mr. Solicit.or General, that

the commission was obligated under NEPA to do 'l!ven as much as

MR. COX:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please tha

Court:
Because of t.ime I i:iay have to limit my argument to

23

•

a single point which is directed t.o the nat.ure of the
injunctive ralief that w~s granted below.

That injunction,

as it has been said, enjoined the Commission fro.n parmi... ting
the interin rate increase and the railro~ds from collecting it.
:10-;1, it is my submission that even if it is

assw,ed that tlH!. plaintiffs h<¼ve standing, that d.i,PI\ a!,)plic::,
tl1at the Commission dld not comply wit11 11r:P11., ~ven on t.hosa
assum;?tions, that injunctive roli~f w-:is erroneous.
Now, of course, ·w-e do not. accept. those assumptions.
They are disputed in our b=i~f.
ass11r:1ption

Th3re is one additional

whic:1 is of great. inport.ance, and that is

that these orders refusing t.o suspend rates are reviewable at
all.
th3t,

If I have any tilna, I shall try to say something about
Otherwise, I shall have to submit it on the brief.
But for the present I am making these assumptions.

1\nd our point is that on those acsurnptions, the court would
have been ent~tled to set aside these orders and to remand the
case to the Commission with directions to the Commission t.o
comply with the court.' s stat.ament of the law.
Commission would have been obliged to do so.

And the
But th'3 court

did not have authority to suspend the rates itself or to
compell the Col"ll1lission t.o suspend them or t.o '3njoin the
railroads from collecting them.
1-low, this is a point of great. pract.ical importance

to the rail transportation system of this country.

This

24

injunction, as it. has been said, has caused and will continue

t.o causi;i substantial rev9nue loss to the railroads ;;ind
particularly to the railroads in tl1e northeastarn part of the
Unit~ St.ates who are lea:::t. able to st.and .i.t.
Dut beyond those iror.iediate consP.quunces, it has
general consequence::; which are far more serious.

Because it

is an assertion of power on the part of a District. Court to
enjoin rates when tJ1e commission has declined to do so in any
Cc'.se in,1olved in environmental issues, to enjoin the railroad
from collecting the rates, altl1ough the rates have never
been d'!tennined to be unlawful, and \1hat is more, to do
these things \1it.hout paying any attention to t·he 7 months
limit.at.ion on st,spension orders tJ1at is spacifically
prescribed in the Interstate Commerce Act.
QUESTIOll:

rm.

COX:

llow long has this sus~nsion gone now?
If you take it from the time the

Commission itself could have suspended the rat.es, I think tJ1at.
that time expired I think on the 5th of September.

If you

take it. from the time that the District Cou.rt. -- I wouldn ' t.
think this is proper, but if you take it. from the time the
District Cou.rt enjoined the rates, they have been suspendsd
more than 7 months because that period expired about the
15th of this month.

So any way you look at it, however you

do treat the dates, t.hese rates have been suspend9d as a
result of th~ District. court's injunction for more than 7

25
months.

l\nd there was no limitation in the injunction at

all.
Uow, the practical importance of this situation
lies in the fact that the most, one of the most, difficult
and constant problems that the railroads of this country have
had for 25 years is the lag, the time lag that s,dsts between
tl1e time when they must. pay increased costs and the time
when they can partially offset thos"3 costs by increasing the
rates.
!low, soma tima lag is inevit-.able,

suspend the rates for 7 months.

And the Commission can
And that loss is irreparable.

Tha railroads can't do anything about it.
But the railroads are gravely disturbed by any
judicial alterations of tne regulat.ory plan of the Int.erst.ate
commerce Act. which increases that. delay and incr-eases the
time lag.
Now, I think some figures about this present
proceeding were pertinent. h<?re.

At. t.he end of 1971 when the

railroads initiated this, tried to initiate this rate increase,
at that time and sines the last time thoy had raised their
rates generally, their costs had increased by $1 billion.
!lost of that.

cost is in labor cost and payroll taxes on wages.

26

In the t.ime in which ~l1is proceeding has be".!ln ~nding to date,
those costs have been increased by another billion dollars.
Now, if the railroads had been able, which they were not, to
lay their hands on the revenue, the entire revenue, that they
hoped to obtain from the rate increase, the general rate
increase that is involved here which was about $350 • illion,
if they had been able to lay their hands on that at the very
beginning of this proceeding, it would have been only a
partial offset, about 25 percent, of these increased costs.
I think against that background, the Court can
Wlderstand why this situat-..ion concerned the railroads and
has concerned the rail transportation system of this country
because the railroads need this :revenue, they need it. to
provide the services which improve their services, maintain
their services to prevent diversion of traffic to trucks
which are, as the appellees say themselves,
consequence.

an environmental

They need it, as a matter of fact, for their

own environmental projects on which they spend a great deal
of money.
Now, the conclusion that, the practical situation
that is created by this assertion of judicial authority, I
point out to tho Court, is a serious one because it's limited
you can say it's limit.ed to cases involving environmental
issues, but that limitation doesn't reduce its practical
significance, because the arguments the appellees here show

HR. COX:

MR. COX:

That' s right., and before it. has ever

considered the lawfulness of the rat.es.
suggested that these rat.es are wtlawful.

And

nobody here has

Even the court

below didn't do that.
QUESTION:

Is there any ponsible argument that

NEP,\ injects factors 11hich the Commisoion should
consider separately and apart from justness and reasonaJ.,lenass?
Or ~-ould it be a part of that concept?
MR. COX:

Well, I would say that if you give those

terms their broadest meaning, Mr. Justice White, that. NEPA
would require the determining -- at least I would be prepared

t.o say that NEPA would require the Commission in c onsidering
and determining justness and reasonableness to take int.o
account environmental factors, which it did sometimes before
the passage of NEPA.
QUESTION:

Now, the Commission's only charter is

to determine justness and reasonableness.

UR. COX:

Yes.

You include in that all the various

discrimination usually is and noncompetitive rates, and that
kind of thing.

That'$ its statutory mandate.

Now what NEPA,

29

I suppose, has done is to add some additional factors to
that just as the Declaration of Transportat.ion Policy did and
as the old Hop Smith resolution did back in the 1920's.
QUESTION':
MR. COX:

As in the case of anti-trust factors?
Yes, as in the case of anti-trust factors

which I think was more done by th~ courts than by Congress.
But it's there just the same.
Now, these consequences are consequences a man might
accept if he were forced to them by some explicit court Iir.s of
judicial decisions or legislative command.

He could hardly

embrace them even in those circumstances.

But my submission

is that this assert.ion of

p0\1er

by the District court. cannot

be justified by any statute or by any line of decisions of
this Court., but is in fact inconsist.ent with the Interstate
Commerce Act and with this Court's decision in Arrow.

Not quite, no.

You still have 5 minutes.

There is absolutely no indication either

in the words of the statute or in its legislative history
that it intended, the statute was intended to amend the
Interstate Commerce Act or change the regulatory plan or

30

overrule
QUESTION:

Did congress even addre~

the question

of the Interstate Commerce Act?

rm. COX: As the appellees, one of them here, says,
oddly enough in support of his ;;.rgument., that. congress did
not specifically deal with this matter, or, to use the
appellee's words, aven pause to consider it.

It seems to rne

e.n extraordinary argument t.o make.
QUESTIOU:

Perhaps that's because no one thought

freight rates could affect the environment at t11e t.ime they
were thinking about this subject.
MR. COX:

I couldn't say.

That ie perhaps a reasonable speculation.

But I do say to the Court on this very point

that their ult-.i111ate reliance in this case is on the NEPA
argument because while they stat.a some precedents and
concepts from existing law, when you examine those cases they
cite in the concGpt.s,. they aren't applicable here.

And, of

course, one on which they principally rely, I think, was
dealt with in that footnote 22 on page 671 of the Arrow
opinion.

So that. the ultimate reliance on this

extraordinary injunctive relief is simply that NEPA changed
the law

How about the necessity for having an environmental

impact statement before you suspend or not the rat~s~
MR. COX:

Well, the dean has -- I beg your pardon.

The Solicitor General has stated the argument on that point.
We heartily concur on it..

I think we

take the position that at the suspension stage, because of
the time involved and the nature of the decision, no
environmental statement, and indeed, no finding of no
environmental impact is required.

That can be dealt: with in

the next st.age of the rate proceeding.

Alternatively we

say that if anything was required, the finding wes required
and the finding was made here and it was supported by

32

substantial evidence.
I would like, if I have any time left. -QUESTION:
HR. COX:

Until the red light goes on.
-- to speak rather briefly on this

question of reviewability \Thich is in some ways o.ncillary to
the poi.nt I have made, although independent..
Now, here again, the appellees rely really on NEPA
because t.here is a long line of cases in the -- unbroken line,
really of cases holding that an order that does nothing
except refuse to suspend rates is not. reviewable at all.
There is a suggestion by Judge Friendly in one case that an
order suspending rates may be reviewable if it's made by,or
vitiated by an absolute lack of power.

For example, if the

commission tried to suspend for more than 7 months.

But

refusalsto suspend have been held generally not to be reviewable, I think because of the considerations pointed out in
the opinion in the Arrow case because of its relati onship to
the injunction point that I have argued.
And here again appellees ultimately rely

on the

assertion that NEPA has changed the law and has made orders
reviewable that were not reviewable before.

And hei-e again

there is nothing whatsoever in the legislative history or in
the Act that suggests the statut.e was ever intended to have
that consequence.
Now, I emphasize in concluding that. my argument on

33

reviewability is inde:;,endent of the argument on the nature of
the injunctive relief, and I end where I began by saying to
this Court that if you assume everything else, the court
below here went far beyond any legit.imata function it has as

a reviewing court when it undertook to suspend these rates
and to enjoin the railroads from collecting rates that have
not been determined to be unlawful.

ORAL ARGlll1El1T OF PE'l'ER H. MEYERS ON BEHALF
OF TUE APPELLEE s.c.R.A.P.
IIR. MEYERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Every year this nation produces more t.'1an 4 billion
tons of solid refuse.

Only a very small fraction of this

scrap is recycled, even though most of it is capable of being
recycled and reused.

Railroad freight rates which are

authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission are a major
factor discouraging recycling,

This is what this case is.all

about.
I will address myself primarily to the issue of the
commission's failure to comply with the National Environmental
Policy Act to the fullest extent possible prior to its
April 24th order.
in this case.

Mr. Dienelt will address the other issues

34

On January 1, 1970, the date NEPA became effect.ive,
a nat.ional policy was established to protect. the environment.
All agencies were required in the strongest langUage to
consider environment.al values in their decision-making
procedures.

In Section l0l(b) (6) of the Act Congress

specifically focused on the recycling problem and declared
that it was the responsibility of all Federal agericies to,
and I quote, "enhance the quality of renewable resources and
approach the maximwn attainable recycling of depletable
resources."
In the three years that NEPA has been in effect,
t.he commission has foiled totally to fulfill this duty to
encourage recycling and has refused t.o implement the procedural
obligations of Section 102(2)(C) of the Act requiring the
preparation of environment.al impact. statemants.

The COmmission

has granted three qeneral rate increases on recyclable
materials since 1970,

this case is the third, without ever

making a detailed assessment of their environmantal impact.,
without attempting to accommodate its procedures to the
requir,ments of NEPA, and without proposing any legislative
measures to the President pursuant to Sect.ion 103 of the Act
to bring the Commission's procedures into conformity with
NEPA if there 'l<->ere any conflicts.
It is hard to imagine a case where both the council
on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection

35

Agency have more strongly protested an agency's implemantation
of NEPA.

These letters to the COlllmission in this and prior

proceedings vere in the record before the District Court. and
are in the appendiic before this Court.

It is s.c.R.A.P.'s position that compliance with
Section 102(2) (C) of NEPA to the fullest extent possible
required the Commission to prepare a draft environmental
impact. statement prior to its April 24th suspension order
in this case.

l'le do not necessarily seek, and the Dist.rict

Court specifically refused to hold more generally that a draft
impact statement is always required before the Commission
makes suspension decisions.

The District Court.• s language

to this effect is quoted on {)age 20 of our brief.
Section 102(2) {C) of the Act requires tbs preparation
of a detailed environment.al impact state!llent prior t.o agency
action involving, as the Solicitor pointed out, a major
federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment..

Copies of this statement, according to

the language of Section 102, and I quote again, "shall
accompany the proposal through the existing agency review
process."
The clear objective of the impact statement require ment is to build into the decision-making process a careful
and thorough assessment. of the potential enviromnental dangers
of an alternative to. agency action and to assist the agencies

36

in iinplementing tl1e policies declared in Section 101 of the
Act specifically including
QUESTIOU:

the duty to encourage recycling.

Mr. !!eyers, what. if the commission had

simply declined to suspand the rates, in effect dona nothing?
What would be your position then as to the requirement. of
an environment.al impact statement?
HR. 1-tEYERS:

It's s.c.R.A.P.'s position, your

Honor, it does not matter what acti011 the Commission takes,
whether it. suspends or does not suspend.

Th9 important factor

in this case is that when the Commissior. is going to make
that decision, when it.' s considering whether o~ not to allow
increased rates on recyclable commodities t.o go int.o effect.,
it is required. to know what effect. those rate increases will
have.

Whether it takes either specific action is not crucial.
The language in section 102 which requires compliance

with 102 to the fullest. extent possible has been held by a
number of courts,which are quoted in our brief, to impose a
high standard.

It does not create, as the court in Calvert

Cliffs pointed out, an escape hatch for foot-dragging
agencies.

The impact statement must be prepared as early

as possible and in all cases prior to agency decision which
may have a significant effect upon the environment.
are interim agency decisions.

These

The cases to this effect and

t.he Council on Environmental Quality guidelines to this
effect are quoted at pages 15 through 16 of our brief.

37

The Solicitor as well as the railroad places great
stress on the Commission's February 1 finding of no
environmental impact.

I would like to addrasi: this point. for

a few minutes.
It is our position that the court. below correctly
held that this unsupported finding which was severely
criticized by both the Council on Environmental Quality and
the Environmental Protection Agency was no more than glorified
boiler plate.

It ignored Section S(b) of the CEO guidelines.

Section S(b) of the CEQ guidelines requires agencies t.o
prepare an impact. statement whenever there is, and I quote,
"potential that the environment may be significantly affect.ed,"
or if the impact is, and I quote again, "likely to be highly
controversial."
The Government points out in its brief that the
CEQ guidelines are ent.it.led to great weight.
that position.

We agree with

In any event, the Interstate Commerce

commission has incorporated the CEQ guidelines into it.a own
rules and would be bound by them in this proceeding.
Another reason why the February 1st finding cannot
adequately support the Commission's decision in this case is
that on February 1st, the Commission was considering whether
or not to suspend a temporary 2.5 parc:ent surcharge.

We

did not go into court after the February 1st suspension
decision.

We waited until the Commission had made a suspension

38

decision on the 4.1 percent psrmanent selective increases.
We are unable to see how a finding with r~spact to a 2.5
percent t.emporary surcharge could be held to support tha
Commission's decision on April 24th when it was considering
larger permanent. increases.
Finally, on 11arch 6, the Commission issued a draft
environmental impact. statement.
is somewhat unclear.

'l'he scope of this statement

At portions of the impact. statament,

the Commission says that for purposes of considering the
impact, t.hey will evaluate the permanent increases.

In other

portions of the statement the Commission says it is considering
the surcharge as if it were a permanent part of the rate
structure.
In this draft impact statement, which is set: out
also in the appendix, the Commission frankly acknowledged
it did not know what effect even the surcharge would have if
made a permanent part of the rate structure.

If this is

true, how could tJ1e commission know what effect larger
permanent increases might have on the environment.

And how

can they continue to rely on this February let finding in
the very beginning of the proceeding
where they made their
,
boiler plate determination about potential impact.
'l'he crucial issue in this case as the railroads
and the solicitor have argued it is whether it is impossible
for the Commission to comply with NEPA and with the CEQ

39

guidelines within the 30-day period it has for determining
whetl1e1' or not to suspend a rata.
Before answering this, I would J.ike to reinforr:e
our position in this case that tJ1e District court did not
hold and

W!'I

ara not seeking an 11bsolute rule that the CC>'71''i~sio:1

must 'llways prepare itc.s d:raft impact state.-nent beforF.l a
suspension deci!Jion, b•tt ,re r.oint O1?t to this Cou-.:t that it
may be quite possible for the Commission to prap;1.re impact
state'l\$1lts in future general rate increase proceeding~ on
recyclable CO'llll'Odities once i~ has finally prepued the
draft envirOJll'l3ntal impact statement in this p>:oceeding.
Secondly, we submit t.o this court that the 30-day
period is not an infle'Kible p'!!riod.

The C01t1111ission can and

has e.xte.,;ded this 30-d'.ly period to several months in order
~ogive the public greater notice of the prop0sed increase.
The Government's reply brief at page 4 quotes a p0rtion of
Section 6(3) of the 1.nterstate Commerce Act.

R.e'!ding that

whole section of the Interstate Coll'IUerce Act it becomes
appa:rent and it has been consistently constxued by the
Inters~,ate Commerce Commission that whenever the railroads
re,:iuest special permission to depart from normal tariff filing
requirements, the Co=ission can require the railroads to
provide the public with what~ver amount of t.ime notice the
Commission thinks is appropriate.
Now, the solicitor's brief points out -- it makes

40

t:he argumsnt that whet:her or not: th:1 Commission should file
an impact statement should not depend upon the fortuitous
circumstances of whether the railroads request special
permission.

It is my understanding, h011ever, that railroad

tariffs for the last 30 years and into the foreseeable future
are a.lways so complicated that the r.iilro ..ds are as a
practical matter always required to seek opecial permission
in these general rat<? inci:ease cases, and that as a practical
mat.t.er, the Coni.'tission will always llave t:he oppo::tunity to
ext1'nd this 30-day period.
More important., however, is the fa::t tl1at. the
Commission should have begun its environmont:al assessm<!nt
when NEPP. went into effect t.hree years ngo.

It. should not

have waited until the railroads came to them with their
proposed increase.

It will always be, in the Co!:'rnission's

language, i~possible for the Commission to comply if it. does
nothing.

It will have its first 30-day suspension period,

in its own language, then :i.t will issue its final order and
it will be impossible to comply in that proceeding.

And then

the second time the railroads come for their rate increases,
it will be impossible to comply at the suspension stage and
by the final order.

And this can go on forever.

Also, the Council on Environmuntal Quality specifically
informed t.~e Interstate Commerce Commission below that it
should file an adequate draft impact stater.ient prior to its

41

first. suspension decision on February 1st and inform them

Are you arg.ling that if t.he Commission

can't. get its job don!I with rospect to tho environmental
impact, that it must suspend the rat.es until it. doss?
MR. MEYER:;:
our argument.

That is not a necessary

conclusion of

It should have su::;pended at lec:st. until it

found out what the inpact was.
QUESTION:
MR. MEYERS:

That's the same argument, isn't. it?
Yes.

But .we don't take that position

that it's necessary in every case.
QUESTION:

Why don't you take that position in this

case?
MR. MEYERS:

In this case we do.

There has to come

an end to the time where the COl'lllllission can continue to qrant
these incremental increases which the council on Environmental
Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency -QUESTION:

The argwnent on the other side is that

you are taking a posit.ion that they should come up with
something in 30 days which is an impossibility.
MR. MEYERS:

I would like to !Mke two specific

responses to that, your Honor.

First, in Section 102(1) of

the Act, Congress specifically requires the commission t..o
adjust its p;coceedu.res to permit it to comply with NEPA.

In

Section 103 of the Act, congress says if there is any

42

conflict which does not permit you to comply to th.:: fullest
extent possible, go to the President, propose changes.
OUESTIO:I:

Do you know whet.her the Commission's

practice almost invariably is to suspend the rates if they
start an investigation?
HR, MEYERS:

No, it is my feeling it is not their

invariable practice,
QU£S'l.'ION:

So even if they must have a proceeding

to investigate the reasonablmiess of th-? rates they don't
necessarily suspend them?
llR, MEYERS:

Right.

That.'s correct,

That's my

understanding, your Honor.
QUES'l.'ION:

That may be why you don't mak .. the

argum9nt I was suggesting,
MR. !-!EYERS:

-..

And in addition, the Commission

neither of the suspension orders involved in this case did
the commission rely upon this impossibility argu."118nt.

The

Commission didn't say it wasn't possible to comply with NEPA.
The Co111J11ission has in effect left it to its counsel to make
this argument to this Court now more than 3 y~ars after NEPA
has been into effect that it.' s impossible to comply.

The

Commission however has not gone to the President to propose
changes, has not attempted to adjust procedures to the
requirements of the Act.
nothing.

The Commission has done virtually

The Com.-nission has -- this is the third general

43

Commission says because they have done nothing previously,
"We can't comply now."
QUESTIO,~:

HR. lfilYERS:

Triggers the need when the railroads

propose increases on recyclable ccmmodit~es which could have
a significant environmental effect.

No.

IIR.

!!EYERS:

I can't see how inspection charges

for grain movements could even remotely have an environmental
impact.
QUESTION:

You said the ICC should have had this

done long before this.
MR. MEYERS:
QUESTION:
MR. t-illYERS:

Is that correct?
That's correct, your llonor.

Why?
NEPA when it went into effect. in 1970

placed upon the Commission in Section lOl(b) (6) a specific
duty to encourage recycling.

I-IR. 11EYERS:

But you are suggesting in response to

Justice Marshall's quest.ion that this is a blanket. requirement
over a whole spectrum of government, or most. of it. at least,
and that without any specific direction or order or request,
they should all be get.ting up environmontal impact statements
on every subject that might come before them sot.hat they will
be prepared to respond in, let us say, 30-day time limits.
Is that your position?

1m. MEYERS: No, your Honor. Our position is that
it's the words of Section 102(2) (C).

The impact statement is

required only for major Federal actions significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment.
Now, the Convnission knows, there should not. be any
doubt that the railroads, for example, will be requesting
another rate increase in the next year or two.

These are things which could have been expected and

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dienolt.
ORAL ARGUi-!EHT OF JO!fi,I F, DIENELT, ON BEHALF
OF TUB APPELLEES ENVIRONME!JTAL DEFENSE

FU!ID

MR. DIENELT:

!tr.

ET AL

Chief Just.ice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to begin my argument by discussing
some of the questions which have been raised by the Court to
other counsel, and initially to reply t.o the question that.
r-ir. Justice Brennan posed t.o 1-!r.. Cox, regarding the relationship between NEPA and this Court's decision in the Arrow case.
The Court's decision in this case applying NEPA
is a very different decision, very different. set of fact.a than
the decision involved in Arrow.
interference with rate-making.

Arrow involved judicial
Arrow involved a court deciding

47

what a reasonable rate would ba, issuing an injunction on that
basis.

This case has nothing to do with that kind of e;,:erci11l!l

of discretion which we ackn01-1ledge is co;mnitted to an agency.
This case deals with clcilr, unambiguous procedures that. the
National Environmantal Policy Act imposas upon all Fuderal
agencies, not including the courts 1-1ho a1:e not agencies under
the APA and whom we submit are not agencies under UEPA.
The significance of the difference between the ArrOW'
set of facts and the set of facts in this case is that in
Arrow it could be said that a court. was inte1·fering with the
congressional decision to commit discretion to the agency.
Here what the cpurt. is doing is enforcing on what is perhaps
the most recalcitrant agency among Federal agencies with
respect to NEPA the clear. congressional requir~ments.

It's

working to enforce congressional requirements; it's not working
against the diJcret.ion of an agency which Congress has
COJll&11itted to that agency.
\fuat the court did was see that the Commission
from tl1e beginning of the National Environmental Policy Act.
on January 1, 1970, had done nothing to attempt, to acconmodate
its practices to the requirements of HEPA.

The court was

faced with the situation where as early as October of 1970
the council on Environmental Quality,which in answer to your
question, Mr. Justice White, is the agenoy which we could say
would have the responsibility to interpret NEPA, had told

48

the Commission, "It's your job to begin to comply with NEPA.
It's particularly your job to apply its procedures in order
to fulfill the explicit policy that congress set forth in
NEPA."

The clearest policy, the clear.est. substantive policy

that Congress set was to enhance the quality of renewable
resources and to approach the maximum at.tainable recycling
of depletable resources.
QUESTION:

What. did the agency ever say,that they

had to complete this statement before they either suspei.ded
or didn't suspend the rate?
MR. DIENELT:

I don't believe t.h.at the agency has

said either way on that question.
QUESTION:

They have never disagreed that it would

satisfy the Act if they did an adequate job during the
process of considering whather a rate is just and reasonable?
1,m. DIENELT:
the District court.
QUESTION:

That was, ws submit., tha issue before

The CEQ didn't. say one way or another.
That's the issue here.

That's one of

so unless the agencies really disagreed

with the commission's position in this respect -MR. DJ:ENELT:

Well, your Honor, we don't have a

statement in this record from the Agency with respect tQ the
general question of whether the Commission is obliged with
respect to rate increase proposals to submit an impact statement in the 30-day period.

We do have statement.a from the

49

CEQ criticizing the Commission's compliance with NEPA int.his
case, and I submit there's a very good reason why we don't
have a statement by the CEO -Ql'ESTIOU:

That JSn't the issue here, is it?

rrn. DIENELT:

The issue here is not whethP-r the

Commission is obliged to file an impact statement in every
rate proceeding in the 30-day period.
QUESTION:

It isn't even whether

the content of

an impact statement submitted by the commission satisfies t.he
Act.
MR. DIENELT:
don't understand.

The issue, your Honor, I am afraid I

The District Court held t.hat the Commission

had not complied with NEPA in this case to the fullest extent
possible.

It didn't say exactly what procadures the

Commission would have to comply with.
that if the Commission

It expressly indicated

made to it a good faith showing of

compliance to the fullest extent possible, that it would~&
inclined not to impose an impact staternP.nt requirement on the
commission or to indicate that its order had violated NEPA.
The Commission has never taken the position until it arrived
in court and it was taken by its lawyers that it's an
impossibility for it to comply with the Act in the 30-day
period.
The 30-day pariod is something of a false issue,
Mr. Justice \·lhite, because rate decisions are not made, at

50

least <:1enaral rate increase proceedings, which is what we are
talking about, are not -QUESTIO,~:

You are s«ying this bccaus'.! the

Commission could suspend for 7 nonths and do its job?
1-1.a. DIENELT:
do, your Honor.

That's one thing the Commission could

Another thing that the Commission could do,

as it has in the 1110st racent general rate increase proceedings,
tell the railroads that they don't have special permission
to file a rat.e within a short psriod of .:ime, thi.t they have

to give the public 75 days notice, or 90 days notice, or
whatever period of time is appropriat~.

And in that time

the Commission can comply with the Act:. to the fullest extant.
possible.
QUF-STIOM:

And you say the Environmental Protection

Act gives them that p()\ier.

,m.

D!ENELT:

Gives the Collllllission, not. the power,

not merely the power, but the duty to comply with the Act
to the fullest extent possible.
QUESTION:

So does that wipe out the 30-day --

doesn't that wipe out the 30-day rate-making process?
MR. DIENELT:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, it doesn't.

In all cases where the environmental

impact is asserted?
MR. DIENELT:

In cases where the environmental

impact is asserted, it may well be that one doesn't exist.

51

And in those circumstances, a Commission finding of no
significant en,,ironrnental impact., if it's based on a record
and if it's adequately explained or at least. if the District
Court can figur1 out what the Co11U11ission did, would suffice
on review.

In some circumstances where ;,ou hav

a general

rate increase proceeding, where you have a rate inc>:ease of
recyclable materials, where there is a significant environment.al
impact, then, we submit, it's appropriate to throw out the
30-day proceeding because llEPA requires 'Chat.
But w~ want to stress that

the 30-d&y issue

is somewhat false becauae .,.ore time is perrni tt'1d to the
Commission under the Act en the one hand, and on the other
hand m,-Pl>.' s roquireruents as interpreted by the CEQ guidelines
and I will refer you to Section 10 of the guidelines -- is
flexible to permit an agency to come to the CEQ and say, "Look,
we have these problems, this is how we want to ccmply with the
Act.

This is what we think is compliance to the fullest

extent possible."

And the CEQ would say, "All right."

But in further response to what Mr. Justice White
was asking, the Commission never went to t.~e CEQ.

The CEQ's

communications with the Commission had indicated that the
commission has to comply with NEPA, it has to begin, and it
should have begun on January 1, 1970, to consider the effects
of its permitting rates to continue to go into effect on
recyclable materials.

And it hasn't done that.

the railroads all it wanted for environmental reasons.

Chief Justice Burger, regarding th_ lP.gislative

consider to be significant.
First, the requirement that agencies begin to
accommodate their procedures to the requirements of NEP))., an
immediate and continuing requirement which was confirmed
almost inimediately after the 1\ct was passed by a Presidential
order, No. 11514.
The second thing is Section 103 of NEPJ\ 11hich says
to an agsncy, "If you have a probler.i, if you can't. comply
with tJ1e Act," and in this case compliance might be suspending
for even more than 7 months while they studied,

I don't say

it would have to be, but. it might be, uthen you come back

would point out to the Court, although this isn't in our
brief, that testimony of the Council on Envirorunental Qualit.y
in June of 1971 before the House Commit.tees on Fisheries and
Wildlife conservation r~garding a citizens action bill in
which the Council, the ag9ncy which is responsible for
interpreting NEPA, which says the council takes the position

similar enviroru.,ental protection 1-egislatl.on confers standing
on concerned citizens and citizens who uioh to challenge
•1iolations of that legislation.
The standing issue is clear.

Driefly, with respect to the question of reviewal>ilitl
we

point out that notJling in Arrow dealt specifically with

reviswabilit.y.

lt dealt with injunctive rslief.

You c;:n have

review under NEPA and still have an injunction not issued.
And there is no indication in the ICC JI.ct of a clear and
convincing legislative att.el'lpt to preclude review.
no indication in

HEPA

There is

that review isn't warranted, and the

Government here is seeking an exemption for the ICC, at least
with respect to suspension decisions which doesn't apply to
any other Federal ag~ncy.
so we submit. that the plaintiffs here have standing
under Sisrra Club, that this decision by th~ Commission, this
suspension order, can be reviewed, that on revi~ of it the
District Court properly found that the Corranission had taker.
no steps in thisor in any other case to at.tempt. to comply
with NEPA to the fullest extent possible, that that was
appropriate and that an injunction should have issued and
t.hat this court should affirm that.
l-tR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

Thank you, gentlemen.
