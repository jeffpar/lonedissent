ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. GRUBB, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRUBB;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am here in a

rather

ominous position today,

fatally speaking, in that when the Travel Act, Section 1952,
of Title 18 of the United States Code was passed in 1961, I was
a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation assigned
to Lake County, Indiana, and I had prepared at that, time the
first summary report to be used for the prosectuion of people
like I am representing today.
This Act. is the Travel Act, Section 1952, of Title 18
of the United Sfc« .as Code.
Court, today is waether

Nov/, the question before this

the Seventh Circuit erred in not

following the case of the U.S. v. Arnold which was cited^in
the briefs and treated in the briefs.

In that case they

treated also Section 1953 which was a companion section of
Section of 1952 whic)i is the Travel Act.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated
and rejected Arnold on the ground that there was lack of
precedent and also that there was lack of reasoning in the

4
case.

This v/as actually a case of first impression for all

practical purposes and thus there was lack of precedent for it.
But I believe that a study of the legislative history, study
of the Acts themselves, and a study of the cases cited by
the Government and cases which I shall cite, support Arnold,
and give reasoning.

Arnold was terse, there i3 no doubt about,

it, it was a terse opinion.

But. nevertheless I think that we

have proper reasoning that can be found in the cases and also
**

in the statutes.
Wow, the petitioners were convicted under Section
i

1952 of the Travel Act.
£

They were horse race bookies and they

used what was, known as the Illinois Sports Wews — I don't
believe we

got this in the record, brought it out — but the

Illinois Sports Wews.

It's a newspaper published in Chicago,

Illinois, and is used by bookies because it contains horse race
betting information and predictions.

This paper was sent to

the petitioners who all reside in Lake County, Indiana.
Incidentally, some of them were my informants when I was in
the FBI.

These parsons used this.

The paper was sent from

Chicago, Illinois, to Hammond, Indiana, and it was consigned
to what was known as the Hammond Wews Agency.

These petitioners

are into the record, went to the railroad station and picked
up copies of it, leaving their money there, they took the
copies, and they did use it in their horse-racing operation.
The Illinois Sports Wews has been held to be a

newspaper and exempt under Section 1953 of Title 18 which is
the companion section.

And it was so held by the Seventh

Circuit which pleaded this case previously.
Kelly v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company.

That vas in

in the briefs.

325 Fed. 2nd 148.

And it was held in a general

way by the Seventh Circuit to be a newspaper and exempt, from
the operation of Section 1953.
Now, Congress had a reason to exempt newspapers from
Section 1953, and that is to protect, the right of the free
press.

But in passing 1953, it permitted the interstate

transportation of a paper carrying with it information, carrying
with it gambling information, betting information.

This

information could be used for only one purpose, nothing else.
It's not worth anything for anything else except gambling.
It's a betting paper.

But Congress permitted this to be passed

and they knew it would be passed and in doing so they knew it
would be transported for one purpose, and that, is to use for
gambling purposes.

This is not going to be used to paper walls,

this is not going to be used to line bureau drawers.

It's

strictly a gambling paper, and the Government made that quite
plain in the various trials that we had.
Now, the cases cited by the Government, in opposition
can be distinguished from the cases before the Court, and also
from Arnold.

In fact, I think they had to explain Arnold.

two defendants in Azar traveled from Detroit, Michigan,to Ohio
where the paper was published, and there they gave information
which was used in the paper, actually used in the paper.

Michigan and there the defendants as consignees picked up the
paper.

The paper was sent to them.

They used interstate

commarce, they caused its use by being consignees, and they
also traveled across the State line to give information for
publication.

Here was direct travel in interstate commerce.

We didn't have it in the case at bar.

7
•The next case was U „ S. v« Ross, a 1967 case, and it
was in the Sixth Circuit.

The defendant was a subscriber to

what is known as the Angel-Kaplan Sports Publication.

Now,

this is similar to the Illinois Sports News, I assume.

This

was shipped in interstate commerce to the defendant in
Tennessee.

The defendant admitted in this case that he was

the subscriber,

lie was a subscriber to this paper.

It was

sent to him directly, and he in effect caused the use of
interstate commerce which is not true of the petitioners in
our case.
And the last case that the Government cited was
U. S. v. Menendez, a 1968 case out of the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals.

The defendants in Florida used a telephone to New

York to get the total liabilities of the 12 Federal Reserve
Banks and the total was to be used as the winning number in a
lottery game.

Here again they directly used interstate

commerce, an interstate facility, which is not true of our
petitioner's.
Now, the Seventh Circuit — back to the Seventh
?

Circuit — in United States v. McCormick, a 1971 case, 442 Fed.
2nd, 316, the

Court spoke differently on the use of an

interstate facility than in the cases before this Court, spoke
entirely differently, and I want to bring these two cases to
the Court’s attention.

The defendant, McCormick, a man in

Indianapolis, advertised in a weekly newspaper for salesmen

to be used in his gambling scheme, in his lottery scheme.
And this paper went across the State line.

It was sent through

the mails, not only through the mails, but it was sent into
interstate commerce.

And the Government urged that this was

a sufficient use of an interstate facility.

The Seventh

Circuit reversed this and said — I would like to read this
• ‘V*-

U.5. v. McCormick, and they start out:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. GRUBB:

Mr. Grubb, you may continue.

Thank you, your Honor.

I was about to read from U.S, v. McCormick.

That’s

a case that came out of the Seventh Circuit Court, and I am
reading here from McCormick:

"In Rewis y,

u.s,,

401 U.S." —

and I will give the correct citation; they didn't have it
here.

It's 28

l.

Ed. 2d493 — "the Supreme Court reversed

the conviction of a gambler whose lottery operation was
frequented by out-of-state bettors.

Construing this same

section, the Court emphasized the intent of Congress to strike
at the truly interstate operations of organized crime.

The

Court refused to give broad-ranging application to the statute
particularly since Congress gave no indication that it wished
to altar the sensitive Federal-State relationship, overextend
limited Federal police resources, or produce situations in
which the .geographic origins of customers,a matter of
happenstance,would transform relatively minor State offenses
into Federal felonies.
"Similarly," — and I'm still reading from McCormick,
— "in UoSo vs, &ltobeli , 442 F. 2nd, 3X0w — also in the
Seventh Circuit — "this Court struck down the conviction of
two extortioners under Section 1952 where-jurisdiction was
claimed on the basis that the victim's check was cleared by

10
mail between Chicago and Philadelphia stating,

’When both use

of interstate facilities and the subsequent act is as minimal
and incidental as in this case, we do not believe a Federal
crime has been committed.’"
Th Court then reversed and added in McCormick,
"The defendant neither used nor caused to be used any inter­
state facility as an instrumental part of his illegal operations.
We must therefore conclude that ro Federal crime was committed
and that the State of Indiana is the only appropriate authority
to punish the defendant for maintaining this local lottery."

QUESTION:
MR. GRUBB:
QUESTION:

Thank you.
Now, in McCormick, the Seventh Circuit —
The boundary in the case of the gambling

house near the state line is one out of this Court's last term
or the term before, isn't it?
MR. GRUBB:

Yes.

HR. GRUBB:

Yes, Rewis is.

I’m going to go —
QUESTION:

That's in 401.

That's the reference that

you —
MR. GRUBB:

Yes, it’s in 401, that's right.

I didnet

have the U.S. citation; I had the Supreme Court citation, the
Supreme Court Reporter and

l.

Ed.

Now, in McCormick, the Seventh Circuit held that
transportation of newspaper information is not a sufficient
use of an interstate facility to sustain a conviction.

Also,

in Altobello, cited in McCormick, the Court held that clearance
of a check through the mail in interstate commerce is an
insufficient

use of an interstate facility, although the

courts have held for years that under Section 2314 which is
the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act, under
Section 2314 of Title 18, that the clearance of a check does
give jurisdiction.

But Altobello said no.

It is difficult for me to reconcile these cases
with the case at bar and also with Arnold, the reasoning that
the Court did give.

And these cases ware cited before the

Seventh Circuit, when I argued it there.
Now, although fcha Court in Arnold did not exhaustively
explain its opinion, it seems to me that the cases which were
cited by the Government and the legislative history here and
the cases cited by the petitioner all give some reasoning to

12
Arnold, and 1 think that Arnold in all its simplicity should
be followed„
But back to Rewis„

This Court made it plain that the

Travel Act is to be applied to truly interstate operations of
organized crime.

And the Seventh Circuit so read that in

the Rewis decision when it handed down the McCormick decision.
Now, the Court in Rewis — I would like to read one short
excerpt in Rewis.
QUESTION;
MR. GRUBB:

What’s that citation?
Yes, JRewis.

Reporter citation here.

I have the Supreme Court

It's 401.

This is what was stated in Rewis;

"Legislative

history of the Act is limited, but does reveal that 1952 was
aimed primarily at organized crime and most specifically at
persons who reside in one State while operating or managing
illegal activities located in another.

In addition, we are

struck by what Congress did not say."
The Court further said in Rewis:

"Matters of

happenstance should not transform relatively minor State
offenses into Federal felonies."
Now, in conclusion, I would like to state that here
there was no organized crime ever mentionedr^no evidence of any
organized crime.

These petitioners were all independent

operators or they were employees of independent operators.
They never ordered nor subscribed to the Illinois Sports News.

13

They did not. use the Chicago South Shore and South Bend
Railroads, commonly known as the South Shore Railroad, they
didn't, use that railroad»

They picked up the papers there,

but they were consigned to the Hammond Jtfaws Agency just fcha same
as many of us do in the morning to get. our morning paper when
the drug store is closed and we get there and we want to get
our paper before we get on the commuter train, we pick our
newspaper out of a bundle and leave our money for it and go
on cur way.
QUESTIONs

I suppose it's reasonable to assume,

isn't it, Mr. Grubb, that Congress was well aware that there
were highly specialised newspapers, as you have characterized
this bulletin —MR. GRUBB:
QUESTION:

I think SO.
— that catered particularly to people

who were betting and to organized gambling.

Isn’t that

accurate?
MR. GRUBB:
QUESTION:

I am sure of that.
Well, now, then, what have you to say

about the fact that Section 1953 expressly excludes newspapers
or similar publications which presumably would reach this
publication, but Section 1952 does not have any such exception?
MR. GRUBB:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
What do you have to say about that?

4

MR. GRUBB:

That’s right.

And I think that Section

14
1953 being the latest, in the statute should control.

X believe

it does control, that the two sections must be construed in
pari materia.

And X cited what I think is the leading case

on that, and I believe that that altered then Section 1952 to
the extent that it was exempt for use.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Grubb.

Mr. Tuttle.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TUTTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
The eleven petitioners here were convicted on five
separate indictments after five separate jury trials of using
and causing the use of an interstate facility,in this case the
Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad, to promote and
facilitate the operation of an illegal gambling operation in
Hammond, Indiana.
I had thought that the question which this Court had
addressed itself to when it granted certiorari was the question
of whether since Section 1953 contains a specific exclusion
for newspapers, are we to assume that Congress intended to
exclude from the scope of the Act an individual who had a
scratch sheet

sent to him through the facilities of interstate

commerce and -thereafter used the scratch sheet to promote his

15

unlawful activities.
As Mr. Grubb has argued the case, he seens to me
to have argued a different case, one on whi'bh this Court did
not grant certiorari, one on which the jury resolved against
the defendantsand one on which the Gdutt of . Appeals resolved
against these defendants, and one on which no petition for
certiorari was filed.

Mr. Grubb maintains that these

petitioners did not cause the use of an interstate facility.
The jury was instructed on this question, and the jury returned
a verdict finding that these petitioners had in fact caused
the use of this railroad.
finding.

The Court of Appeals made the same

Indeed, it seems to me that Mr. Grubb has conceded

the main question in this case when he says the cases like Ross
and Azar are to be distinguished.

Ross was distinguished by

Mr. Grubb just now on the ground that Ross had subscribed to
a paper in Chicago and thereby had in fact caused the inter­
state shipment.
But if the question is whether the shipment of these
papers through the channels of commerce is a subject of the
Travel Act, then in conceding that Ross is properly decided,
in my view that concedes the main question in this case.
might say the same is true of Azar.

I

In Azar, for instance, again,

it was an interstate shipment of scratch sheets of the kind
we have in this case.

And in Azar in fact, one of the two

defendants didn't travel in interstate commerce, one did, the

16
other remained in Detroit and picked up the packages when they
reached their destination consigned to Mr. Williams in Detroit.
Now, I will address myself to what I consider to be
the question upon which this Court granted certiorari, which
is the question of the scope of the Travel Act and whether the
transportation or causing the transportation of those sheets
through the facilities of interstate commerce could violate
the Travel Act.

And in the course of stating the facts of

the case, X may shed some light on the questions Mr. Grubb has
raised but which I contend is not before this Court.
The petitioners were owners and operators of five
separate horse-race betting parlors in Hammond, Indiana, each
of which was and was conceded to be operated in violation of
the laws of Indiana.

Now, in connection with the operation

of these horse-race betting parlors, petitioners used a
publication known as the Illinois Sports News.

Mr. Grubb has

showed the Court a copy of the Illinois Sports News.
Sports News is known as a scratch sheet.

The

A scratch, as the

Court may know, is a horse that has been withdrawn from a
race in which it was previously entered and the withdrawal is
not. reflected perhaps on the previous afternoon’s racing forms.
Therefore, the scratch sheet is of considerable value because
it’s published 8 a.m. in the morning , distributed promptly,
and can be used by bettors in placing their wagers on that
day's races.

Indeed, the testimony in this case shows that the

1?
scratch sheet, was vital to these operations.

One convicted

co-conspirator wno testified for tine Government, testified
that on days when the scratch sheet failed to arrive, business
fall off by as much as 80 percent.

There is also evidence

that the entire shipment by the month to the Hammond News
Agency dropped off drastically after the raids in this case.
QUESTION:

I don't suppose this bears on it, but

is that all the kind of information the scratch sheet contains
is just what horses have been scratched?
MR. TUTTLE:
more than that.
it

oh, I am sorry, your Honor.

It contains

It contains, for instance, the day's entries;

contains the jockeys and their weights; it contains the

track handicapper's predictions, and sometimes predictions of
the publishers themselves.
QUESTION:

The reason it's called a scratch sheet

is because it has scratch information.
MR. TUTTLE:

That's right, but that's only one

aspect of the information which is contained.

It is the

information which makes a scratch sheet different from other
kinds of horse race betting publications and makes it important
that it be published early in the morning and gotten out and
distributed very quickly.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, assuming I don't, know anything

about it, does it. also include the morning line?
MR. TUTTLE;

That would be called the morning line,

18
the handicappers! odds and the other information of which I
have spoken.
And the rapidity with which it is distributed or must,
be distributed is reflected in the facts of this case.

These

petitioners and their co-conspirators by prearrangemenfc with
the local news agency, the Hammond News Agency, arranged to
pick up their copies of the Illinois Sports News at approximately
9:02 in the morning when the 8:30 train from the Randolph Street
Station in Chicago, Illinois, arrived with these scratch sheets
on it.

The petitioners would then take their scratch sheets

and distribute them to their various horse-race betting parlors.
Now, of the 90 copies that arrived every day consigned
to the Hammond New Agency, approximately 57 were picked up and
used by the co-conspirators in these five separate cases.

Mr.

Goodman, whom I have mentioned testified for the Government,
picked up 22 copies a day to use in his gambling operation.

H©

paid for them weekly to the Hammond News Agency, a Mr. Frost
of the Hammond News Agency.
QUESTION:

Another 35 copies —

You are emphasizing that he paid for them.

Does that mean they are quite an expensive item?
MR. TUTTLE:
Honor.

As a matter of fact, they are, your

At. the time of the trial they were 35 cents apiece.

Much of the same information can be obtained from other
papers, but this which contains no information except racing
information is more expensive because of the rapidity of

19

distribution and the fact you can get it early and you can
place your bets early.
But my point of indicating the arrangement for
payment was in a way to allude indirectly to the question of
causation.

Because in this case there was an arrangement to

receive 22 copies a day and to pay for them on a weekly basis
to the Hammond News Agency which was the consignee of these
papers from Chicago.
The other 35 which were picked up by the co-conspirator
were picked up at 9 o'clock in the morning.
envelopes of cash at the train station.

They left

Later on in the morning.,

in the ordinary course of business, employees of the Hammond
News Agency would come, pick up the remaining 33 copies and
distribute them to various retail outlets around the Hammond
area.

They would hit the newsstand around 10:30 or 11, much

later, of course, than these petitioners had it for use in
their betting parlors.
Now, as I have suggested, the question is whether
the exclusion of these papers from 1953 entails a similar
exclusion from 1952.

The statute in this case, the Travel Act,

provides, and I will read if the Court will indulge me the
relevant part of the statute.

The statute provides:

"Whoever

uses any facility in interstate commerce with the intent." *—
and then in subparagraph (3) — "to promote, manage, carry on,
establish, or facilitate the promotion, management, or

20
establishing or carrying on of any unlawful activity and
thereafter performs any act specified in
which I have just read you,

subparagraph (3}, "

"violates the Travel Act."

And then the statute defines "unlawful act."

And

significantly it defines it as a business activity, a business
enterprise involving gambling, gambling offenses in violation
of the laws of the State in which they were committed.
Now, the Congressional hearing reflects a concern
that otherwise lawful or innocent interstate travel was being
used to facilitate illegal gambling.
gambling.

And I stress illegal

As you know, the Travel Act prescribes interstate

travel with a purpose to promote other violations of state law
such as narcotics violations, liquor violations, prostitution
violations, extortion, arson, and now it’s been extortion and
bribery, and now it's been amended to include arson and
controlled substances.

But at the time of the hearings when

Attorney General Kennedy testified on behalf of this legislation,
the 3tress was on gambling, on the fact that $20 billion a year
changed hands in yambling and gambling was a prime source of
funds for the underworld.
gambling.

Indeed, his examples all involved

He spoke, for example, of moving the proceeds of

an illegal gambling operation in one State to another State.
Or he spoke, for example, of the interstate and nation-wide
travel of lay-off men for syndicated gambling operations.
Now, if Congress was concerned with otherwise lawful

21

travel which might be the subject of promoting an unlawful or
illegal activity in violation of State law, Congress was
equally careful not to make innocent interstate travel the
subject of criminal sanctions»

And it was Senator Ervin who

stressed this, and Senator Ervin stated that h© would hate to
see the time come when this country would make it a crime to
travel having certain thoughts as he conceived this Act could
make it a crime simply to be thinking something while you were
traveling interstate.

And in reaction to Senator Ervin's

concern, the Jud: ciary Committee amended the law and they
added a second proviso, they provided, as in the overt act
requirement in conspiracy cases, that after the interstate
travel, the individual do something which promotes the unlawful
activity, thereby assuring that the statute wouldn't involve
any kind of thought control or punish somebody merely for
their thoughts.
Now, the statute was also limited to be sure not to
apply to individual gambler who might be traveling interstate,
even if he traveled interstate with the intent £o engage in
illegal gambling and thereafter in fact engaged in illegal
gambling.

The statute wouldn't cover such activity as

Attorney General Kennedy stressed when he testified in support
of this legislation that the target was organized crime and
the statute had been drafted to cover only what was called
travel in furtherance of "business enterprises" so that no

22

casual or sporadic involvement in gambling activities would
be covered but only such .regular and continuous conduct as
might be classifed as a business enterprise.
In this way travel in interstate commerce even with
an unlawful purpose in mind is

not covered unless it’s followed

by some kind of overt act after the travel which promotes the
unlawful activity.

And, of course, the same language makes

it equally clear or doubly plain that innocent interstate
travel could never be the subject of any sanction under this
law.
Now, of course, there is nothing novel about Congress
making interstate travel for unlawful purpose the subject of
a criminal sanction and criminal responsibility.

It is, after

all, no crime to travel interstate with a woman, but. if that
travel is for the purpose of prostitution, the Mann Act is
violated.

Similarly, it's no crime to travel interstate with

a child, but if the child is held for ransom or reward, the
Lindberg law is violated.

The mails are available to anyone,

but if the mails are used in furtherance of a scheme to
defraud, the mail fraud statute is violated.

By the sme

token, anyone can use the telephone, make a long-distance
telephone call, or anyone can equally send a telegram interstate,
but if these facilities are used to further an unlawful
activity, then they are legitimate objects for congressional
concern and congressional regulation.

And as this Court knows,

23

a classic violation of the Travel Act is the use of the
interstate wires to convey betting information, wagers, or
racing results.
Now, just as gambling information can be sent inter­
state to gamblers over the wires, so the morning line in the
Illinois Sports News can be sent interstate to promote illegal
gambling operations.

And this fact no more inhibits the lawful

movement of the Illinois Sports News than the Mann Act or the
Lindbarg law inhibits the interstate travel of women or children.
Now, in our view Section 1953 achieves its result
of avoiding- criminal responsibility for innocent conduct by
an entirely different route.

Section 1953 defines a class of

contraband the interstate shipment of which is banned
irrespective of the purpose for which it is sent, or the motive
for which it is sent or the use to which it. is put after it is
sent.

Section 1953 defines gambling paraphernalia in very

broad language, including any slip, token, paper, writing, or
other device designed or adapted for use in bookmaking or
wagering on sports activities or numbers operation.
It was this broad language which caused Senator
Keating in the hearings on the bill to express concern that you
or I or anyone else might commit a crime under the 1953
provision by traveling from here to New York carrying a copy
of the Post because it might happen to contain the results of
a sporting activity or the results of a horse race.

And it was

24
in response to this concern that Congress amended the statute
to say this section shall not apply to the carriage or trans­
portation in interstate commerce of any newspaper or similar
publication.

And we concede for the purposes of this argument

in any event that the scratch sheet, would qualify under that
subsection.
It seems to us that what 1952 achieves by limiting
its coverage in terms of the intent of the activity and the
overt acts which are required after the activity, 1953 achieved

by simple definitional exclusion.

Now, Congress recognized that otherwise innocent
travel or movement in interstate commerce could in fact be the
subject of criminal responsibility where the requisite intent
was present and where there were overt acts in furtherance of
the unlawful activity following that interstate travel or
movement.
We see no reason to assume that Congress intended that
one particular kind of innocent act,in this case the transporta­
tion by rail of newspapers, should be excluded from the subject
of criminal responsibility if and only if the requisite purpose
is there and overt act is there following the interstate movement
or the causing of the interstate movement.
QUESTIONS

If this material that's in-tills sheet, racing

sheet that you have got, was a special column on the sports
pages of a conventional newspaper and was transported in the

25
ordinary course of sending thousands of them to Philadelphia or
Richmond or somewhere else, would that standing alone violate
the statute?
MR. TUTTLE:
at all.

Well, standing alone, it does nothing

One would have to hypothesize circumstances under

which it was used.

I mean, to ship alone doesn't violate the

Act in any regard.

One has to hypothesize a subsequent use.

QUESTION:

Someone has to connect it up with some

other activity.
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, again, it depends.

The Act

requires that it be shipped with a given purpose to promote an
unlawful activity and requires also that after the shipment
it is used to promote the unlawful activity.
QUESTION:

Well, if these same gentlemen had then

purchased a hundred of them and sent them by special courier
and delivered them to people in furtherance of this, then that
would violate the statute, in your opinion.
MR. TUTTLE:

No question about it, in our view,

assuming that they were then used in furtherance of the unlaw­
ful activity.

We do not — assuming as we do for the purposes

of argument that this is a lawful publication, we would argue
that the statute could in principle be violated by the us© of
any publication if it were used with the requisite intent and
if it were caused to be shipped in interstate commerce and
if it were thereafter used to promote an unlawful activity.

26

New, we believe that the evidence in this case showed
that these petitioners in fact caused the interstate shipment
of the Illinois Sports News.

I have recited to you the way

in which it was obtained, the way in which it was distributed,
the way in which it was picked up and the way in which it was
used.

We therefore believe that these individuals caused the

interstate shipment of these newspapers with the intent to
promote their unlawful gambling operations, that they there­
after used these newspapers in violation of Indiana law to
promote their unlawful gambling operations.

And we therefor©

believe that they were guilty as charged in the indictment
and as the jury found, and we further believe that the
.*

convictions should be affirmed.
