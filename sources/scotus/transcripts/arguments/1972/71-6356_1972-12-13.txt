MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No, 71-6356, John Doe against McMillan,
Mr, Valder,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J, VALDER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, VALDER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Michael Valder,

With me are Mrs, Jean

Camper Cahn and Mr, Dan Bowling.
On behalf of the petitioners, we request this Court
to reverse the judgment of the lower courts and to remand this
cause for consideration of preliminary injunctive relief and
trial on the merits.
But more important than a reversal and remand,is
our request that you declare the law which will govern this
case.
The issues presented compel, we believe, several
declarations by this Court,
First, and perhaps most importantly, is a declara­
tion that the Federal Courts are open for the business of
adjudicating petitioners’ claims based on the Constitution and
the Civil Rights Laws of the United States.
Secondly, a declaration that the Speech or Debate
Clause protects no one, Congressmen included, from defending

4
a suit for violation of constitutional rights to privacy.
The decision in the Gravel case, we believe,
indicates that Speech or Debate Clause imunity extends only to
valid legislative acts.
Q

What about a speech on the floor of the House that

was libelous, per se, invading the privacy of some person in
a very gross way.

Is there any remedy for that?

MR. VALDER:
Honor,
Q

The cases don't indicate so, Your

We are not faced with that here, however,
If you are resting on a right of privacy claim, and

I am assuming now the grossest kind of libel you could imagine,
on the floor of the House, in a speech by a Member.
MR. VALDER:

I suspect that that case would be taken

to Court and this Court would be asked —
Q

Haven't some of them been taken to Court?
MR,VALDER:

I believe so, Your Honor, and the

speeches on the floor have been held to be immune, under the
Speech or Debate Clause.
But, here, as in Gravel, we are dealing with
activity not on the floor.

We are dealing with subsidiary

activity in committee, by committee staff, by investigators.
And, it seems to us, that your teaching in Gravel
that invasions of citizen privacy, or illegal or unconstitutional
actions by legislators or their staff are not immune under the
Speech or Debate Clause.

5
I believe the technical language in your decision
in Gravel,in Mr. Justice White’s decision, was that the Speech
or Debate Clause should not be extended to protect illegal or
unconstitutional actions beyond those which would prevent
executive control of legislative speech,debate or legislative
activity.
Q

Let’s assume that the publications haven’t been in

a Congressional context, just a newspaper or an author or a
magazine had simply gone around and picked up the same infor­
mation from the same sources that had published it.
Wow, what right of your clients would have been
infringed?
MR. VALDER:

Q

Their constitutional right to privacy.

Now, are you claiming that there is anything in­

accurate about any of the statements?
MR. VALDER:
inaccurate.

Absolutely, Your Honor, that they were

We never had a chance to correct those inaccuracies.

We never had notice that this publication —
Q

Are you saying that they were libelous?
MR. VALDER:

of privacy.

They are libelous.

They are invasions

They are a violation of constitutional and civil

rights, protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
Q

I know, but you are talking about privacy.

You.

are asserting though whatever right it is to sue for libel,
for damage to reputation.

6
MR. VALDER:

Right.

All of the allegations we would

make if the respondents were private persons are being made,
plus additional claims.

And that is that the deprivations

here were by and under color of Governmental authority,

and

that the Bill of Rights as a protection against Governmental
excess -Q

1*11 put it to you this way.

Do you think, you have

any right at all against anybody you have to allege or assert
that the statements were false?
MR, VALDER:
could be true.
Q

Wo, Your Honor, no.

The statements

It is still a violation —

Where do you find any constitutional right of

privacy unless the statements are false?

Where do you find

that the statements, as long as they are true, are not
protected?
MR. VALDER:
a private tort.

The common law right of privacy is

The matters disclosed can be true.

They can

be false.
Q

What would be your answer to the defendant who

pleaded the First Amendment, and said I am protected in making
these statements unless you can show they are false?
MR. VALDER:

1 think we are in the law of privacy,

where, even if true, there are areas of our lives as citizens
where others cannot disrupt or destroy or reach that privacy.
You get into the additional sanction of libel and

7
slander if the statements are false.
Q

As you said, you are relying on all the law that

would be available to you if these defendants were private
people, such as defamation law, common law, statutory law
of defamation, plus constitutional claims against these
defendants are Government, the Federal Government, and surely
I don't suppose the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment
have anything whatever to do with truth or falsity, do they?
1®. VALDER:

That’s correct, Your Honor,

I believe the Griswold case, Mr, Justice Douglas’
opinions and other opinions in Griswold, constitute a clear
majority of the Court at that time, perhaps even of this Court,
that there is a constitutional underpinning for the right of
privacy, independently of truth or falsity, that there is a
private sphere.

It was known at common law and the Constitution

included that within

the special protections of the Con­

stitution.
So, it is private common law tort, plus it is
constitutional.

And here, there is still a third degree of

liability, and that is the whole doctrine of Governmental
excess that the Constitution protects citizens more against
Governmental excess than excesses or overreaching by private
parties.
And that, of course, brings us to you.

That is,

we submit your role, your special and peculiar role in this

8
case because it is the Government which is responding and its
officials.
Q

You would have the same allegations and the same

thrust to your complaint, I take it, if instead of having the
invasion of privacy that you claim made out by written reports
of the committee, one of the Members had made a speech on the
floor of the House, using all of the same words, revealing all
of the same information, would you not?
MR. VALDER:

I believe we would bring that suit,

Your Honor.
We would bring it against his aides or his staff who
procured the information, assuming it was procured in the way
this information was procured, which was as alleged surrepti­
tiously, clandestinely, and we don't know what els$ because
we were thrown out of Court without a chance of discovery.
Q

I take it in the case Mr. Justice White put to you,

where it appeared in the newspaper, where you see the news­
paper, and then, even though it is based on invasion of
privacy, in that sense, you would be subject to the strictures
of Time and Hill, wouldn't you?
MR. VALDER:
Q

Yes, I see.

Going against the newspaper.
But here, you rely on other constitutional provisions

because here you are involved with alleged conduct of the
Congress, is that it?

9
MR. VALDER:

That's correct.

Also, vie are in the deep privacy area.
figure

Mo public

possibilities or implications here whatsoever, and

also it is the question here that what was done in this case
was never authorised by the Congress, never authorised.
Yes, an investigation was authorised and we concede
that, but the investigation resolution clearly spelled out
how information was to be procured, and that is at hearings.
Q

If it wasn't authorized, then link up for me how it

becomes government action, governmental action?
MR. VALDER:

Right,

It is governmental action.

The manner and method of procuring and compiling
this information and putting it in a report was totally outside
the House Rules and the rules of the Committee on the District
of Columbia.
Those rules have safeguards which provide minimal
due process protections.

None of them applied here.

The information was obtained by an investigator
and our consultant to the Committee, from a teacher and a
principal.
So, the obtaining of the information was not -the method was not authorized in the resolution, and the manner
in which it was incorporated into a report — this information
was not brought into the record through a hearing.

There

were several days of hearings in this investigation, but none

10

of them dealt with this information.
This information ~~ we've called it hip-pocket
information — came in by an investigator to a consultant and
was put in a report.
The committee never passed on the report.

It was

merely sent to the speaker by foe Chairman of the Committee
with a request that it be printed.
Q

Do you allege that an investigator engaged in any

illegal conduct in the course of gathering it, like he
entered any private files, broke any locks, or violated any­
body else5s Fourth Amendment rights?
MR. VALDER:

To the extent that we know, Your Honor,

and, of course, there has been no discovery, we have alleged
that the information was obtained by a District of Columbia
police officer on loan to the Capitol Hill Police, in turn on
loan to the House Committee as an investigator.
By what authority, he went about the schools, whether
he used his District of Columbia Police credentials or his
Capitol Police credentials, or was merely an independent -Q

But you don't allege he engaged in any specific

criminal conduct in the course of his investigation?
MR. VALDER:

We alledge that he engaged in un­

constitutional conduct because he

participated in a breech

of the privacies —
Q

I understand that, but that's just restating your

11
position.
MR* VALDER:
Q

Not a criminal statute, I don’t believe.

There have been precisely the same thing, using the

same conduct, then, what would be your position?
MR. VALDER:

Our position would be that it was

a breech of his right, constitutional right of privacy aid
common law tort, breech of teacher-pupil privilege, all of
which would —
Q

Would you direct that against the reporter or the

teacher?
MR. VALDER:

Against both.

The teacher because

the teacher violated the rules and the Constitution by dis­
closing information.
Q

This is information --

You mean a reporter can violate the Constitution by

by asking questions?
MR. VALDER:

I think he certainly can. Mast reporters

get away with it, but if it is a breech of the privacy which is
protected, a cause of action lies for that breech.
Now, most information is given to reporters locally
by those who have the complete interest in the information,
.. . *r

..

v . . •

Here, the students had an interest, and they were never
consulted.
Q

You would have to rely on some common law theory,

wouldnft you?

As X understand the Fourth Amendment, it

protects privacy to the extent it does only against Governmental

12
acts.
MR, VALDER:

One of.of the cases which we have cited

in our brief, as 1 recall, was a case by a private citizen
who was in an accident and was photographed, evidently in some
0

disarray, a lady.

And she successfully maintained an action

for breech of privacy against the newspaper photographer who
took her picture and the newspaper who published it.
Q

But that's non-constitutional Brandeis-Warren type

privacy, isn't it?
MR. VALDER:

Yes.

Mow, returning for a moment to the Gravel decision,
as we understand that case, there can be speech or debate
immunity for valid legislative acts.
And, our position is that what was done here was not
valid legislative act.

It was unauthorized.

The method used

was contrary to House Rules and contrary to procedural due
process requirements, and it was contrary to Committee rules
in the way in which the Committee report was processed and
printed.
Secondly, to the extent that it was a valid legislative
act, the Bill of Attainder. Clause speaks to a limitation on
speech or debate immunity.
The Bill of Attainder provision of the Constitution
is internal evidence within the Constitution itself that
Congressional action will not always escape judicial scrutiny.

13
So that:, if it is a valid legislative act, it begins
to partake of a Bill of Attainder.

And if it is not a valid

legislative act, there is no speech or debate immunity.
Q

You mean to say if Congress published this report
tf

- r. .

»■

it could be stopped?
MR. VALDER:

He believe it can be.

It has been

temporarily stopped.
Q

You certainly don’t have to go that far, do you?
MR. VALDER:

Well, actually, we don’t want the

report stopped, Your Honor,
excised*

We want the students* names

It can serve no valid legislative

purpose whatso­

ever to contain the students’ and their parents* names.
We concede that every ounce of information in that
report may be relevant and serve a valid legislative purpose,
but what purpose is served by putting the names of 12, 13
and 14 year old students in that kind of a report?
The only justification offered in the lower Court
was a terse statement that the names lent credibility.
Well, we submit that credibility used in that context
really means the interest that a gossiper has in knowing who
is the subject of gossip.
Q

Do you say that everything was of — except the

name — served a valid legislative purpose?

Do you suggest

that the information even though false, shouldn’t be deleted?
MR. VALDER:

It may and it may not have served a

14

valid legislative purpose.
We are not challenging that.

Some of that informa­

tion may be valid and useful, other of it cay not be at all.
We don‘t really care.
Q

Congress isn’t limited to gathering useful informa­

tion in the process of legislating, is it?
HR, VALDER:

Probably most of the information they

get turns out to be not useful.
Q

Isn't that the normal process of inquiry, whether

you are preparing for trial in a lawsuit or preparing to pass
legislation?

You do a great deal of sifting before you get

any nuggets, isn't that true?
MR. VALDER:

That's true, but what I was focussing

on is the Barenolatt.Watkins, Rumaly, line of cases, where,
without authorization and with no legislative purpose whatso­
ever, this Court has said the Federal judiciary may inquire
into what's going on in Congress.
And that was the focus.
get the names and publidh them.
legislative purpose.

Here, no authorization to

Ho ostensible or apparent

In fact, contrarywise, the constitutional

proscription of violating privacy would indicate that those
names shouldn't be there.

Affirmatively that they should not

be there, not just negatively that there is no need to put
them there.
Now, I might say that we are also requesting a

15
declaration that the Bivens doctrine, Bivens v, Six Unknown
Federal narcotics Agents, creates an independent cause of
action against the Federal respondents here.
Those respondents acting under color of Federal
law, we submit, are suable, and a cause of action lies against
them, under the 1971 doctrine in Bivens, just as against the
District of Columbia respondents, there is an independent
cause of action under the 1871 Civil Rights Act, that’s
Section 1983 of Title 42, that 1983 severely limited the
immunity available to local officials.
How, I wanted to mention that we are aware of
the District of Colimntbia v. Carter case which was argued
before you about five weeks ago.

It is significant that in

that case the District of Columbia Government did not bring to
this Court the issue of official immunity, which was decided
against the District of Columbia by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
The only issue brought to you in that case was
whether the District is a person within the meaning of Section
1983.
As noted in the dissenting opinion in our case, the
Carter decision which had been decided before the Doe case was
decided, clearly ruled on the question of immunity.
However, the majority opinion below did not even
mention the Carter case.
dissenting opinion.

It was discussed at length in the

16
,

And it is our position that the extent and degree

and scope of official immunity in the District of Columbia
has been refined and honed to a very sharp edge in a series of
decisions beginning with Spencer, Elgin and leading up to
and including the Carter decision, and that the method of
adjudicating official immunity questions has been set*
The District of Columbia has not appealed that
method of adjudicating official immunity claims.
Q

You are talking now about the District of Columbia,

not about the Congressional defendant?
MR. VALDER:

That’s correct.

Under 1983, we assert a claim against the teacher,
the principal, the superintendent and the Board of Education.
Q

As far as the Congressional, you are asserting

claims only against Congressional employees, not against the
Congressmen themselves?
MR, VALUER:

We are asserting claims against the

Congressmen themselves, Your Honor.
Q

Even Judge Wright didn’t consider the case as against

any except the employees, did he?
MR. VALDER:

I believe Judge Wright’s opinion makes

clear that he was so much more concerned about the sweeping
grant of authority to committee aides, that he took that
question up and dealt with it.
How, as you may recall,

17
Q

He opens his opinion without reaching the more

difficult question, whether this clause protects Members of
Congress.

1 would hold that the seven Congressional appellees

were not Members of Congress and were not so protected.
MR. VALDER:

Our position is that certainly as to

injunctive relief, the Federal Courts have the power in
appropriate cases, to enjoin a Congressional report.

That

would be relief directed against Congressmen.
Now, the question of damages is stickier.

But, we

believe that we can reach the Congressmen respondents on the
question of damages upon showing that they participated in
a violation of our constitutional rights, that, as said in
United States v. Lee, no man is above the law, no one is.
And, if that means that you must exercise your
most supreme power to touch the Congressmen, we submit it
must be done.
Q

But their immunity wouldn’t depend on what the

Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia has said about
the District of Columbia law of immunity, would it?
MR. VALDER:

It would as to the official immunity

doctrine, Your Honor.
Let me recapitulate.

There are two doctrines of

immunity operating for the Federal respondents, the speech
or debate -Q

Take the Barr v. Matteo type of immunity.

Now,

18

certainly in Barr v. Mafcteo the fact that Barr may have been
here in the District of Columbia didn’t lead this Court to
say that it is the District of Columbia law, as construed by
the Court of Appeals, that governs his immunity, did it?
MR. VALDER:

No, it didn’t, but in the District of

Columbia, the Courts have in the past ten years done a
tremendous amount, in several cases, of expansion, contraction
and redefining how the Barr doctrine is applied in the District
of Columbia.
Q

Nell then, if you are going to urge that here, as

governing the Congressional defendants, you must urge it on
its merits, it seems to me.

I mean we are not bound by what

the Court of Appeals says.
MR. VALDER:

No, you are not, but we submit that the

Court of Appeals was bound by its earlier opinions in this
area, and that it did not follow them under principles of
stare deeisto*
That Court — a different panel of that Court had
just decided Carter, comes Doe v. McMillan, they don’t even
cite it.

They disregard it, and they rule contrary to it.
And, we are suggesting that you need not reach the

Barr v. Matteo question, you need only declare that in the
District of Columbia, starge decisas principles operate.
The doctrine, as it has been announced and defined
and is operating should be applied in this case the same as in

19
any other case*
We did not ask you to rule on the Barr v. Hafcteo
doctrine.
stare

We merely want the Court of Appeals to follow

decisis principles, which we believe are binding on

the District of Columbia because they did not appeal that
/

question in the Carter case,
Q

Can we preclude it from getting into it?
MR. VALDER:

Well, certainly, I don't think you are

precluded if you care to.
Q

It seems to us that it —

It would take the stare

decisis in the wrong

direction, wouldn't it?
MR. VALDER:

Well, it is our belief that Barr v,

Matfceo should be applied, perhaps throughout the country, as
it is in the District of Columbia, under that line of cases.
Q

Barr against Matteo has nothing to do with the

District of Columbia.
MR. VALDER:

It is a Federal rule.
That's right.

As to how persons sued in the District of Columbia
in Federal cases.

q

Barr-Matteo is as to immunity of Federal officials

In Alaska, Hawaii and the other A8 States, and the District
of Columbia.

Is that right?

MR. VALDER:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

I don’t see how we can be bound by an interpretation

of Barr-Matteo by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

20
I don’t think it is binding on us.
MR. VALDER:

Your Honor, if I may.

In the line of

cases in the District, the doctrine of Barr was not played
around with.

It was the way in which the Courts in this City

must apply is, and that is, they must take a look at the case.
They must take a close look at the precise governmental
function at issue.
What the Carter case stands for is, you can’t throw
out a case the day it is filed.

The judge has an important

role to play.

the function.

discretionary?

He has to look at
Would

it inhibit

Is it

the proper exercise of the

Government to hold this official liable for the performance
of this function.
That was the point in the Court of Appeals, that
it was not proper to throw this case out on the very day it
was filed, without any responsive pleading, without any chance
to take a good look at the function at issue.
Now, that's the modification in the District of
Columbia.

It did not throw out Barr v, Matteo.

That's still

absolutely the law.
Q

Would it be possible to agree with you without

considering the Carter case?
MR. VALDER:

It would be possible by simply saying

that —
Q

That's my only point.

Why do you keep working on the

21

one case?
MR. VALDER:

Your Honors, flashed on my time.

I

would like to save a minute or two for rebuttal, if it is
possible.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Valder.

Mr. Vinson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED M. VINSON, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. VINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My brief and that of my colleague, Mr. Cramer, is
on behalf of those whom we have referred to as the Legislative
Respondents, the Members of Congress, the Committee Members
and their aides, the Committee Staff, who are named as
defendants, the Public Printer and the Superintendent of
Documents.
This case involves an attempt by petitioners to
selectively censor, by injunction, a document of the Congress,
a committee report which was ordered printed pursuant to the
Rules of the House of Representatives.
The petitioners also seek damages against the
respondents for their failure to delete the names from the
report.
A House Resolution,which is printed at page 5 of our
brief, authorized the Committee on the District of Columbia to

22

conduct a full investigation and study of any instrumentality
of the District of Columbia Government.
The resolution also empowered the committee to
require by subpoena, or otherwise, the production of documents
as it deems necessary.
The House further directed the Conmittee to report
to the House the results of its investigation, and its
findings and recommendations.
The report in question issued after seven months of
investigation,fourteen hearings, all of which concerned the
District of Columbia School System and the report contained
36 specific findings and 27 recommendations.
It is our position that the opinions of the Court
in Gravel and in Brewster and all of the dissents in those
cases, coalesce as a unanimous holding that the legislative
respondents, all of them, are immune from questioning in any
other place on account of the matters complained of.
In short, we feel that the Speech or Debate Clause
affords absolute immunity to the legislative respondents in
the context of this case.
Q

Mr. Vinson, are you arguing — urging any substantive

deficiency in the plaintiff's case, just on its own bottom?
Do you feel you must turn to immunity, legislative
or otherwise?
MR. VINSON:

I think it is best to turn to the

23
immunity, Mr. Justice, because the Speech or Debate Clause
was designed to prevent harassment
Q

of legislators and —

Or for even considering the substantive merits or

demerits -MR. VINSON:

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

The holding of —
Q

In your theory, Mr. Vinson, could the legislative

people involved here have simply made no appearance at all
in the District Court,and stood on the Speech or Debate
Clause as a complete defense, even to heing required to put
in an answer?
MR. VINSON:

Theoretically, I suppose, Mr. Chief

Justice, that's correct.
Q

It might not be a courteous thing to do with respect

to the District Court, but you say you could do that as a
matter of constitutional law.
MR. VINSON:

It might neither be courteous nor

prudent.
We feel that the holding of Gravel settled the
question of who is covered by the Speech or Debate immunity
and the scope of that coverage.
The scope extends to, in the words of the opinion,
"the sphere of legitimate legislative activity," and the
Court's opinion made clear that the clause applies not only
to a Member, but also to his aides, insofar as the conduct

#•

24

of the latter would he a protective legislative act if
performed by the Member himself.
Applying this test, you have to analyse the nature
of the acts performed by the Members and by their staff to
determine whether they are protected acts.
First, the Members of the House.
Now, their involvement in the complaint relates
solely to the issuance of a committee report which was
authorized by the House, which was printed and distributed
pursuant to the Rules of the House and statute.
The Members, we feel, are clearly protected by the
Speech or Debate Clause.
. A long line of cases, running from Kilbourn through
Johnson to Gravel, unequivocably have held that committee
reports are as much within the coverage of the clause as are
speeches on the floor of the House.
Secondly, we turn to the committee aides, the Clerk,
the Staff Director, the Counsel, a Consultant and an investi»
gator for the committee which issued the report.
The complaint doesn't allege that the Clerk or the
Staff Director or the Counsel did anything with respect to
the report.
It does allege that the Consultant to the Committee
was responsible for the investigation, and that the Investi­
gator of the committee conducted the investigations which were

25
used in the report.
Now, exactly what actions are complained of?
Turning again to the allegations of the complaint,
reproduced on page 9 of the appendix, it is alleged that
Savoid, who was a junior high school principal, gave the
investigator copies of disciplinary letters and other materials.
It is alleged that Irven, who was a teacher, gave the
investigator copies of attendance lists, school test papers
and other materials.
So we have an investigator for a committee and he
is alleged as such in the complaint.
The committee was authorized to inquire into the
D.C. School System and further authorized to obtain documents
by subpoena or otherwise.
*

This investigator was given -- and the words in the
complaint are "given” — he was given school documents by
school officials.
Petitioners now characterize the obtention of these
documents as clandestine and surreptitious, in an attempt to
avoid the holding in Gravel, but they don't really challenge
the committee's right to interview school officials and obtain
school records from them.
In the Court below, the majority opinion, at page
75 of the Appendix, stated that petitioners, quote, "do not
challenge the propriety of the investigation or the issuance of

26
the report, generally — i „ e., absent the use of their names —
nor could they,'* end quote.
And the dissenting opinion below, at page 104 of the
Appendix, stated that, quote, "Indeed, they (the petitioners)
do not even challenge the right of Congress to examine and
summarize the confidential material involved.

They only wish

to retain their anonimity."
Thus, we have a coraraittee aide receiving relevant
documents in a most routine way.
We submit this is an integral and legitimate part
of the preparation for a legislative act.
The gravamen of the petitioners* complaint against
the aides, and the Congressmen, too, for that fact, really boils
down to the failure of the committee and the House of
Representatives to delete their names from the documents
included in the official report.
And the Speech or Debate Clause affords complete
immunity to the Congressmen, and in this context their aides
with respect to the Committee report itself.
As the opinion in Gravel says, at page 17, Slip
opinion, a Member's conduct at legislative committee hearings
may not be made the basis for a civil or criminal judgment
against a Member because that conduct is within the sphere of
legitimate legislative activity.
As this Court said in Katz v. United States» 389 U.S.

27
at 350 in Footnote 5, 'Virtually every governmental action
interferes with privacy to some degree."
Q

Mr. Vinson, if there were allegations that in the

course of gathering the information a Congressmen,or an aide
at his direction, invaded the constitutional rights of some
private person, wouldn't you be called upon to answer that
allegation, even if you weren't with respect to the later
publication?
MR. VINSON:

Yes, sir.

I think you would doubtless

assert Speech or Debate immunity and you also would respond
as to the merits —
Q

My question is, you do agree that the Speech

or Debate immunity wouldn't cover unconstitutional invasions
of other people's rights in the course of gathering information?
MR. VINSON:

I think that is correct, Your Honor.

I might add there that the Bivens case,referred to
by counsel for petitioners, didn't even reach the Immunity,
the official immunity doctrine.

That merely held there was

a Federal cause of action for an illegal search under the
Fourth Amendment, a situation that is not present in this case.
Q

Are there such allegations made In this case?
MR. VINSON:

Q

None, Your Honor.

Mr. Vinson, Mr. Justice White's question about having

to answer a question or answer a summons based upon a violation
of plaintiff's constitutional rights limited to the Speech and

28
debate immunity, or would you give the same answer if it were
a question of the official immunity?
MR. VINSON:
Q

Oh, I think the same answer, Mr* Justice.

Let me understand, Mr. Vinson, are the constitutional

rights that the petitioners here claim were invaded?
MR. VINSON:

I think they claim a generalized right

of privacy, right of anonimity, a right to be left alone,
and, as was stated in Katz, virtually every governmental action
interferes with privacy to some degree.
The question in each case is whether that interfer­
ence violates a command of the United States Constitution.
Now, many people who are named in Congressional
hearings, and who are named in committee reports, would much
prefer to be left alone, to remain anonimous, but that wish
cannot and should not prevail in light of Congress' Constitu­
tional mandates, and the protection —
Q

When, in your judgment, then, would this kind of

claim reach the state where you would have to answer, as you
suggested —
MR. VINSON:

I can conceive of no case, Mr. Justice,

where in the context of a committee hearing and a committee
report, where it is alleged that the contents of the committee
report breech some right of privacy where Speech or Debate
wouldn't afford complete Immunity.
Q

I take it you are saying that -- they say what really

29
hurt them is when the names were published.
MR. VINSON:
Q

That’s correct, Your Honor.

And that breech or that invasion couldn’t have

and didn’t occur until publication.
MR. VINSON:
Q

Which was in part of a conmittee report.
MR. VINSON:

Q

That’s correct —

That's correct, Your Honor.

And there couldn't have been any such Invasion,

publishing a name, prior to that time, because in the process
of gathering information, they naturally gathered the name.
Q

As to an invasion at the time of publication itself?

Q

Really, as I understand this, the argument of their

claim is that anonimity —
MR. VINSON:

They wish to censor out their names,

that's correct,
Q

Mr. Vinson, what about this charge that this is

outside of the scope -- all of this — is outside the scope
of the committee?
MR. VINSON:

Mr. Justice, the resolution authorized

the committee —
Q

First of all, does it matter if it is published by

the committee?
MR. VINSON:

I would argue that it does not matter,

that Congress made the decision to publish this In a committea
report, but I would urge upon you that it is not without the

30
scop© of the committee in its enabling resolution.
Now, there have been other cases of speech on the
floor and committee reports that may have been unfortunate,
but as the Court’s opinion in Brewster points out, at pages
15 and 16 of the Slip opinion, the clause has even enabled
reckless men to slander others.
But, as the Court said, that was conscious choice
of the framers.
The third group of legislative respondents is made
up of the Public Printer and his subordinate, the Superintendent
of Documents.
The Public Printer was once officially titled
Congressional Printer,

He is required by statute to print

Congressional documents; consulttee reports are required by
Rules of the House to be printed and a statute requires Congress
to have its printing done by the Public Printer.
The printing of committee reports, I think it goes
without saying, is an absolutely essential part of the
legislative process, and the printer is as much in the process
as the investigator or as is the committee clerk who collates
the pages.
Q

Suppose in fact the publication of the names here

was an unconstitutional invasion of the children involved.
Just assume that for a moment.
that, in your view?

Who would have to answer for

31
MR. VINSON:

I don’t think anyone would be

answerable, Mr. Justice, because I don't believe the Speech
or Debate Clause is a balancing type clause.

I think it

affords immunity to speech on the floor of the House and to
committee reports.
Q

Even to the House printer who publishes it?
1®. VINSON:

Yes, sir.

I think the printer in this

case — the Congress is required by statute to use hira to
print their materials*

So he is an essential part of the

legislative process, and to hold otherwise would entirely
frustrate the intentment of the act —
Q

Why wouldn't you at least limit immunity on the

publication end of the publication that's reasonably connected
with the legislative process?
MR. VINSON:

That's exactly what the statute provides,

The statute itself, Title 44, which is printed at the outset
of our brief, sets up by statute the pattern of publication
and distribution.
Q

Well, I'll put It to you this way.

Do

you think

the legislative Immunity governs sale of committee hearings
to the public?
MR. VINSON:

I think it well might in view of the

informing duty of Congress.
Q

What if it doesn't?
MR. VINSON:

You perhaps might make a distinction

32
between sale to the public, although I think —
Q

Or distribution to the public?
MR, VINSON:

I think it would be a difficult

distinction to make in view of Congress1 duty to infossi*
Q

You are assuming that that duty to inform is within

Speech and debate Clause range, aren't you?
MR, VINSON:

Well, I think it is.

We don’t have to

get into —
Q

You may have a duty to inform, but it may not be

a legislative act.
Q

If the committee did not publish, and suppose it

refused public requests and newspaper requests for copies of
the report? Might not the Freedom of Information Act come into
play?
MR. VINSON:

It could\ery well, Mr. Chief Justice.

It is our position that the printing of Congressional
reports required by Rules of the House is an integral part of
the legislative process*
Without the printing, how do the other Members learn
of these 36 recommendations and — 36 findings, 27 recommends*»
tions, suggestions for appropriations, etcetera?
Q

You are limiting that to printing by the Public

Printer, I take it?
MR* VINSON:

Yes, indeed.

We feel that the Public Printer comes well within the

33
intentraent and scope of Speech or Debate in printing reports.
Q

Are there any allegations that distribution in

this case, beyond simply publishing for the purposes of
informing the other Members of Congress?
MR. VINSON:

Q
Columbia?

There are none that I am aware of.

But what about the distribution to the District of
And their further publication of the information?

MR. VINSON:

There is a standing and standard list

of those to whom committee reports are distributed.
are people on the list for distribution.
how far that list extends.

There

I am not aware of

For instance, Federal Agencies

get copies of all committee reports.

Q

Well, now,why would -- tell me, why would this

— why would you say the distribution of this report to the
Secretary of Labor, for example, be within Speech and Debate
Clause immunity?

What's that got to do with performing the

legislative duties?
Q

Or to the Members of this Court?

list, for all I know.

We may be on that

What does that have to do with Speech

and Debate?
MR. VINSON:

The only response I can give to that

has to do with the Informing function.
Q

Again, returning to the Freedom of Information Act,

isn’t the whole thrust

of that Act-to require all Government

agencies to open their records far more widely than they had

34

ever done before?
MR. VINSON: To open them totally to the public unless
they fall within one of the specific exemptions,
Q

Does the Freedom of Information Act —(inaudible)
MR, VINSON:

I really can1t answer that question,

Mr. Justice.
I don't know whether the Freedom of Information Act
is applicable to the Legislature or not.
Q

It may not be.

I was addressing myself to the thrust of the

Freedom of Information Act, passed by the same Congress that
we are now talking about.
I don’t mean the same Congress by number, but the
same institution.
MR. VINSON:

If need be, the Public Printer also has

available to him the protection of the Official Immunity
Clause which I will not labor.
My colleague, who respresents the District respondents,
will be addressing himself to Barr v. Matteo.
With respect to petitioners' arguments concerning
Bill of Attainder and House Rule 11, we would stand on our
brief.
In closing, I would point out what this case is not
about.
This case does not involve the Grand Jury Inquiry,
nor private republication of documents introduced into the

35
ccrnmittee hearing, as Gravel»
It does not involve criminal charges, as in Johnson
and Brewster.
Nor, does it involve a search alleged to be violative
of the Fourth Amendment, as in Dombrowski, and we don't have
here Kilboum or Powell situations where legislative decisions
lack constitutional underpinnings.
Rather, we have here a case involving the most
routine legislative acts, all well within legitimate legis­
lative processes —
Q

I gather, Mr. Vinson, that your basic submission is

however right the petitioners may be, that there has been an
invasion here of personal constitutional rights.

Nevertheless,

legislative immunity, Speech and Debate, means there may be
no judicial inquiry into whether or not those rights have been
violated?
MR. VINSON:

I would take that position, yes.

.My private position would be, however, that there
has been no invasion of constitutionally protected rights.
We respectfully urge that the decision of the Court
of Appeals should be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Cramer

Thank you, Mr. Vinson.

36
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. CRAMER, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CRAMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Let me first put in focus, as I see it, Speech and
Debate, as compared to separation of/powers.
Speech and Debate is part of separation of povsers,
and,

was specifically stated in U«S. v. Johnson, "The

Speech and Debate Clause serves a function of reinforcing
the Speech and Debate power so deliberately established by
the Founding Fathers. Therefore, separation of powers is
emphasized and it is reinforced by the Speech and Debate Clause
and not limited by it."
Then, let me get in, in view of the questions that
have been asked, I would suggest it would be most helpful to
the Court to quote some of the questions raised with regards
to, for instance, printing information.
Once a committee report properly printed by the
Congress, ordered by the Congress to be printed, pursuant to
a resolution of the Congress, and unquestionably pursuant to
the power of Congress, because here we are dealing with the
Congress as the sole legislator and sole governor of, under
the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8 of the District of
Columbia, that in those instances there is no question but
what the committee report itself is beyond question by this Court

37
or by anyone else.
It is a legislative act.
Being a legislative act, it is beyond the province
of this Court, as it would be of the Executive, to inquire
into the motives of the Members, why they put the information
in.
That is a decision by the duly elected representative*
If he makes a mistake, he is answerable to his constituents»
And, incidentally, in the House you are answerable every two
years.

That’s a pretty tough test*

And that’s a good

assurance to the public that their discretion is going to be
properly exercised.
Now, as to distribution of the papers, this is a
report.

It is in the public domain.

And, the Congress has

a duty in representing the people — has a duty to inform the
people.

Otherwise, how can the people judge whether the

legislator is going a proper job, the Congress is properly
representing and properly legislating for them.
So the Congress has a duty.

How else can the

people determine what additional laws are needed? And» after
all, a Congressman is a representative of the people.
And what concerns me about some of the questions,
some of the cases that I have read, is that it appears that
there is an effort, as my colleague has said, to balance;, to
balance what?

38
You cannot balance an Individual's constitutional
rights in the context of the duty of all of the Congress to
legislate.
Some of the cases have clearly pointed this out.
And let me refer to, for instance, the Methodist case, which
is a Circuit Court of Appeals, by Judge Edgerton as Chief
Judge, very fine judge, in which the Court specifically said
that the power to declare unconstitutional — and I think
this is what causes a lot of the problems in the thinking of
the judiciary — power to declare law unconstitutional does
not support the conclusion that they, the Court, may censor
language that they think is libelous.
And, I say to this Court, this is precisely what
the petitioners in this case are requesting.

I say, further,

that to accept their position would, in effect, say that this
Court should balance the constitutional legislative powers
in its broad sense, not against one Member as compared to
a complaining citisen.
We are talking about the broad sense, when you are
talking about speech on the floor of the House, when you are
talking about the contents of a document, when you are talking
about an effort, as these complainants are attempting to
impose, an effort to censor,

because they are asking then

that you waive the constitutional legislative mandate.
As a matter of fact, that comes almost within the

39
doctrine of the major case recently decided, relating to
Powell,
The constitutional mandate for Congress is
to legislate and is a separation of powers question when it
is exercised, and when within the legislative concept*
Once that’s determined, there is no further question*
Q
publish?

What1s the scope of the Congressional order to
What does that mean?

Does that mean that the

Congress is ordering the report that it orders printed to be
open to purchase by the public ?
MR. CRAMER:

The Congress does not, and has not,

exercised, and I don’t say it couldn't if it saw fit to do
so in its wisdom, has not published and printed documents
for the purpose of public sale,
Wow the Government Printing Office can make them
available by request and they should.
Q

I just want to know, in this case,you are saying

that the Congress ordered, not only the printing of this
report, but the report to be available generally to the public.
MR. CRAMER:
Q

It did not.

However —

Was it available to the public?
MR. CRAMER:

It was consistent with the Act of

Congress that says specific documents shall be made available,
and I would not think it would be improper for them to say,
yes, it is available to the public, even though, assuming it is

40
defamatory — it is a resolution authorized by the Congress.
Q

1 still don1t understand.

You say that the

authorization in this case was a Congressional —
MR, CRAMER:

It is the customary Congressional

numbers that go to largely Governmental agencies and the
Congress Itsdf, by statute,
Q

But you aren't saying that there was any authority

from the Congress in this case to make the report available
to the public?
MR. CRAMER:

Mo, sir.

Page 4 of our brief.

Let me close by saying that whether the material
in a report is wrongfully acquired, defamatory, erroneous or
not in the authority of anyone, as a result of that, there
is nothing that the authority of anyone has to prevent Congress
from publishing any statement, even if it is erroneous and
defamatory, and that's Methodist Federation.
Q

I suppose this Court decided the question of

prior restraint and a rule held that it was irrelevant how
the information was acquired, in the Pentagon Papers case.
Did we not?
MR. CRAMER:

I would think that's correct, sir.

And Hearst v. Black says, let me close with reading
this one comment, "Although the information there was un­
constitutionally acquired"-- this is the case in this Instance,
although I disagree with them on the conclusion on the facts —

41
"If it be insisted that this is the acknowledgement of a
power whose platitude may become a cataclysm,the .answer., is
that the Congress is as much a guardian of liberties and
welfare of the people as the Courts, under our separation of
powers.
Q

Turn to page 4 of that.

I guess it is a statute,

isn't it, Distribution of Documents and Reports.

I notice

this seems rather limited, to the Senate 150 copies; to the
Secretary of the Senate, 10; to the House Documents, not to
exceed 500; to the Office of the Clerk of the House, 20;
Library of Congress, 10.

Well, now, what authority in that statute is there
for distributing these to the officials of the
MR. CRAMER:

—

The question was asked, could Congress

distribute it?
Q

Q

No, my question was, did it?
MR. CRAMER:

It did not.

It did not.

Not in the District of Columbia or

any offices?
Q

The report was distributed to the District of

Columbia.
MR. CRAMER:

There are some additional copies made

available, such as to the Library of Congress.

If the

District of Columbia wants one, it can go to the Library to
get it.

42
Q

But it didn’t.
MR. CRAMER:

Q

So the question is, is it distributed?

Can you tell us, Mr. Cramer?
Was it distributed by the House to the District of

Columbia and its officials?
.

MR. CRAMER:

• ■

»

Hot to my knowledge.

i

Q

All right, thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Cramer.

Mr. Sutton.
Q

Would you mind, Mr. Sutton, before you begin.
I gather the District did get copies, did it not?
MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

There are several copies in our office.

Where they

came from, specifically, I don’t know, but we were furnished
with copies.
Q

You didn't go to the Library of Congress and get

them, did you?
MR. SUTTON:
Q

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

You didn't buy them, did you?
MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. SUTTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SUTTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the District of Columbia respondents,

43
consisting of the members of the Board of Education,
Superintendent of Schools, a junior high school principal
and a junior high school teacher.,
Our position, succinctly stated, is that the
doctrine of official immunity, as interpreted and applied by
this Court in Barr v« Matteo. and Howard v. Lyons, a companion
case, forecloses their liability.
We would like to take these respondents individually.
first, we would like to take the Board Ambers and
the Superintendent of Schools.
The gravamen of petitioners' case, as to these
respondents, is that they should respond to damages for
failure to promulgate regulations governing the confidentiality
of school documents, earlier than they did.
We respectfully submit to this Court that tills is
a quasi-legislative function, a top-level function.

It is

clearly within the framework of Barr v. Matteo and it is
not remediable In damages.
The teacher and the principal, perhaps take on a
different light.
In regard to their liability or alleged liability,
we emphasize at the very outset that unlike the Barr v. Matteo
case, this case in the context of the principal and teacher,
involves an Inter-Governmental dissemination or communication,
a communication within the framexvork of Government itself.

44
Let me illustrate that with a comparison.
Let's assume that instead of giving this data to
a Congressional committee, the principal and teacher gave the
data to the School Board, and the School Board, in turn,
published it.
Perhaps, there might be an action for damages
against the School Board, but not against the principal and
teacher for giving the information.
We submit that Congress, vis-a-vis the District of
Columbia School System, may be fairly viewed as supervisory,
or senior School Board, and as a kind of employer, and has
plenary power to investigate the School System.
its purse strings.

It controls

It certainly may be analogized with top

level employer.
It is within the periphery then of an employeremployee relationship that this information was tendered.
We submit it is absolutely privileged, even applying the
standards articulated by then Chief Justice Warren in his
dissenting opinion in Barr v. Matteo.
And we would also emphasize the petitioners do not
question the right of these officials to give the information.
We would refer the Court to pages 35 and 37 of the
Appendix.

I am not going to quote chapter and verse, but they

emphasize in the Trial Court, "We don't question the right
of Congress to get this information.

We don't question the

45

right of teachers to give it."
As petitioners said, almost verbatim, they can go
into schools, they can talk to people as they did.

About

that, we do not quibble.
What we complain about is the reproduction and
the insertion of names.

Well, the insertion of names, it so

happens, took place twelve hearings later, six months later.
Q

We don’t know how they were gotten, do we?
We don't know what was said, at ell, do we?

Between the policeman and the principal and the teacher.
MR. SUTTON:

I believe we do, to some extant, Your

Honor, because the report contains

verbatim interviews

conducted with many local school officials, many principals,
and —
Q

But there was no hearing on it, was there?
MR. SUTTON:

Q

No, Your Honor.

There was no hearing.

We don't actually know, do we?
MR. SUTTON:

No.

We know that — what petitioners

allege and what the report shows, that there was —
Q

We don't know that the principal was turned over to

his superior, do we?
MR. SUTTON:

We do in the sense that we know that

Congress is the ultimate superior.

We know that the principal

is a subordinate of that superior.

We also know that interviews

took place —

46
Q

I am just emphasising what Judge Wright said in

a dissenting opinion, that things like this should have a
hearing to find out whethere Barr~Matteo applies or not»
And the only way to find out is what actually happened.
Why do you object to such a hearing?
MR. SUTTON:

Because it is clear from the record

as to what did actually happen.

If what happened was

as

alleged by petitioners, we would say is it already law; the
doctrine of official immunity applies, that we have a kind
of employer-employee relationship here, that under the
applicable decision of law, that this gives rise to an
absolute privilege; and we also have the reported evidence
which shows that —

q

what is there in the ;evide nee to show

why the principal turned it over?
MR. SUTTON:

Nothing.

Am I correct?

The principal turned it over because

he was called by an investigator of a congressional coasaittee
to do so.
Q

Was it a congressional investigator or was it a

policeman or an individual?

Where is that in the record?

MR. SUTTON: It is alleged in the complaint, Tour
Honor, that — I think it is fairly inferable from the
complaint and the record that the investigator was acting In
tke Committee's behalf.
Q

My only point is that a hearing would have straightened

47
this all out.
MR. SUTTON:

A hearing certainly would have been

better, but our position is that it is not legally required.
I would like to emphasise,in the few moments I
have left,the proposition that the Civil Rights Act does not
alter the immunity of the District of Columbia respondents.
Under the Civil Rights Act, petitioners urge that
the Civil Rights Act should apply to the District of Columbia
respondents, because the District of Columbia is a State.
First of all, that question is pending before this
Court. In D.C. v. Carter, petitioners rely essentially upon
a statement by Judge Wright, dissenting, '’It should be noted
that the Courts have consistently held that the District of
Columbia is a State or Territory within the meaning of the
statute "citing Hurd v. Hodge.
We submit that this is not that clear, that it is
now pending before the Court, that the Court has requested
supplemental memorandum.
We would also submit that in the peculiar circum­
stances of this case, we have the Constitutional power of
Congress to legislate the District of Columbia.

We have

Congress vis-a-vis the school system, as a supervisory school
board.
Under the circumstances, we submit that it would be
inconsistent to apply a Barr v. Matteo standard to the lower

48
eschelon Federal employees,yet a Civil Eights Act standard
to the District of Columbia employees*
Q

Are the District of Columbia Board of Education

employees of Congress?
HR. SUTTON: In a technical sense» they are not,
Your Honor, but in a general sense, they are.
Q

I say if they are then they are covered by Gravel*
MR, SUTTON:

We don't urge that they are covered

by Gravel,
Q

Well, I was just wondering how far you were going.
ME. SUTTON:

Q

No, we wouldn't go that far*

Thank you.
MR, SUTTON:

We would also emphasize that even

assuming the Civil Rights Act does apply in this case, then
the question would be what are the dimensions of the
immunity doctrine under that Act?
Now, this Court has not yet articulated the
dimensions, but lower Federal Courts have.
We can take standards articulated by lower courts,
we can weigh competing interests, certainly, and we can come
up with an equitable result.
Now, it seems that at one end of the spectrum you
have the right of the Congress to receive information.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the right
of privacy.

But the right of privacy is alleged to have been

49
violated here, not in the context of the right of Congress to
receive information, but in the context of publication of
information.
So, really, again, it is a question of complete
good faith, as conceded by petitioners.

And though the

Federal Courts do hold that if there is good faith the
Civil Sights Act of 1871 does not'alter the immunity of the
Government.
And we submit that that is fairly applicable here.
One other analogy that X would like to make*
It seems that there was a companion case to Barr v.
Matfceo, and that was called Howard v. Lyon.

That companion

case involved the commander of a Boston Naval Shipyard.
It so happened that the Commander of the Shipyard
made a press release, limit Information to Congress.
information was not requested.

The

It was delivered unsolicitedly

by the Shipyard Commander, and was given not to a congressional
committee but to the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.
We submit that that case would indicate that the
rule of the immunity doctrine is a fortiori applicable here
for two reasons.
First of all, the principal may fairly be analogized,
as we see it, to the Commander of the shipyard.

He has

extensive duties within the periphery of the school system.
Secondly, I would emphasise this.

We don't have

50
an unsolicited inquiry, unsolicited response to a Congressional
Delegation,
We have a solicited response by

a committee of

the Congress.
That leaves only the teacher, as we see it.

Now,

the teacher will not find analogies with any prior decisions
of this Court, we admit, neither with the Barr decision nor
with the Howard decision.
But it is not without significance that since Barr
was decided and before Barr was decided, many lower Federal
Courts have applied the immunity doctrine to low eschelon
officials comparable in nature of position to the teacher,
personnel officers, game wardens, treasury agents*
We submit that those authorities while obviously not
binding on this Court, are persuasive*
Soj in all respects, we submit that the Court should
apply the doctrine of official immunity to the District of
Columbia respondents in this case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Sutton,

Mr. Valder, you have about five minutes left,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL VALDER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. VALDER:

First, it is our understanding of the

51
Freedom of Information Act that before disclosure of this
kind of information is permitted, authorized or required,
under the Act, that names of private citizens must be excised.
I consulted with counsel, and it is our under­
standing —we do not have a copy of the statute with us —
but that is our understanding, the same Congress or the same
institution .—
Q

You mean the Act applies to Congressional documents?
•

MR. VALDER:

If the Freedom of Information Act were

applying to this information, I understood that to be the
Court*s question — what would be the standards and we under­
stand the standards to require excision of the names.
Q

I think, Mr. Valder, that it permits the agency to

refuse disclosure where names are involved, rather than requiring
them to refuse disclosure.
MR. VALDER:

You may be right, Your Honor,

I think the point is that Congress showed
a sensitivity in the Freedom of Information Act to that
question, and that there is a way to prevent breeches of
privacy or anonimity.
Secondly, it is our understanding that the distri­
bution of this report was virtually unlimited.
We called and got copies.
copies we have.

X don't know how many

Mr. Sutton says that they have copies.

I believe our clients called the committee.

down and get some copies.

This went off on the pleadings in the District

Court, didn’t it — your motion to dismiss?

On the pleading.

I presume that would be the

most authoritative source for us as to whether there was or

Do you say anything about distribution in your

complaint?
MR. VALDER:

Your Honor, I am referred to Paragraph
on information and belief. "unless

restrained, defendants will continue to distribute and
N

publish information concerning plaintiffs, their children
and other students," etcetera.
I am not sure that’s as good an allegation as might
have been made, but I believe that was the thrust of the ease

restraining order.

That's why we went for a temporary

53

The next point I would like to make, Your Honor,
is that the District of Columbia respondents are in error when
they claim in their brief, and as Mr. Sutton did in his
argument, that we made a concession in the District Court —
Q

In paragraph 5 of your complaint,

said defendants

also caused the report to be distributed to members of the
public.
MR. VALDER:

Okay.

Thank you, Your Honor.

The concession is important because it is a funds™
mental argument made by the respondents in the District of
Columbia

— the District of Columbia respondents.

The only

concession that was made was made by counsel at the hearing
before Judge Sirica, . when he said that he did not complain
about the fact that investigators talked to the teacher and
the principal, period.
He did not concede that the teacher and principal
had a right to give this information — these documents —
to the investigators.
Talk, yes.
no.

And that is a pertinent distinction.

Disclosure and passing of documents with names,

There was no such concession.

I am sorry if there has

been some confusion on that, but -- and what's more, even if
there had been that kind of a concession, we submit that the
procedures in the District Court were highly irregular.
We went to Court at 4:30 the day the complaint was
filed, on our motion for a temporary restraining order, to be

54

met by a sui sponte dismissal on the merits, with the judge
asserting he thought it was frivolous.

We had no idea we

were to defend a motion to dismiss, or summary judgment, that
no one had made.
And, even if there may have been a concession, we
don’t think' that it is a real concession, but there was no
concession on this teacher and principal giving the documents.
And I think you may have to read the transcript of
the argument.
Another point is that we submit that as to the
District of Columbia respondents, Congress is not the ultimate
superior.

The law is the ultimate superior of public

officials, and because of the peculiar relationship in this
city between public officials and the House District Conanittee,
it is tempting to say that the House Committee is the govern­
ment, but it is not.

The real government in this city is the

law, and teachers, principals, boards of education, Congress­
men, staff and investigators, have to comply with the law.
And that is the ultimate superior. And that is why
we are here.

We think that the processes of the law and the

p rotections of the Constitution, and the protections of a
civil rights act now 101 years old, provide us with a remedy,
and that an injunction is possible if only the Court House
doors will open.

They have been closed to us.

last Court we can go to.

This is the

55
Civil Rights Act of '71 — you mean 1983?

Q

MR. VALDER:
the Civil Rights

I am sorry.

It is Section 1983 of

Act of 1871, which, incidentally, was

passed about two months after a bill creating a Territorial
Government in the District of Columbia.

That is the reference

to the District of Columbia versus Carter, supplemental
memorandum.
We adopt that position.
Finally, Your Honors, these children have been hurt
and they will continue to be hurt.
For this to follow them throughout their lives,
is, we think, unpardonable, and must be remedied.
Q

Well, if this document was in the Library of

Congress, wasn't it available to every newspaper that wanted
to get it?
MR. VALDER:
Q

It certainly was, Your Honor.

Well, is it illegal for it to be delivered to the

Library of Congress?
MR. VALDER:

Your Honor, it is water over the damn.

It should have never been published with their names.

Having

been published, we want an injunction that further distri­
bution excise their names and to the practical extent possible
the report be recalled with the names excised.
That is limited injunctive relief.
and sweeping

It is not broad

My time is up.

We submit.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:04 o'clock, p.au, the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
