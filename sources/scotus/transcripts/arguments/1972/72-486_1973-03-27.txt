HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 72-486 and 486,, Federal Power against
Memphis Light, and Texas Gas Transmission against Memphis Light?
consolidated.
Mr. Huntington, you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. HUNTINGTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These consolidated cases are here on writs of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit.
The basic question presented is whether the Federal
Power Commission is barred by Section 441 of the Tax Reform
Act of 1969 from permitting a company, subject to its
jurisdiction, to cease flowing through to the company’s
customers in the form of lower rates.

The benefits derived

from the use of accelerated depreciation on certain property.
If the Tax Reform Act does not bar such action, the question
arises whether the Commission’s action in this case was
proper.
Before I discuss the facts of this case, some
introduction is appropriate.

4
It has long been established that federal income
taxes are includable as an expense under the cost-of-service
method used by the Federal Power Commission in ratemaking.
Accelerated tax depreciation was first authorized
in 1954 with the adoption of Section IS 7 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

Under accelerated tax depreciation, deductions

for a particular asset are relatively high in its early
years and relatively low in its later years, compared to what
they would have been had straight-line tax depreciation been
used.
When the matter first came before the Commission in
a ratemaking context, the Commission determined that the use
of accelerated tax depreciation 3imply resulted in a tax
deferral.

Accordingly, the Commission decided that for rate­

making purposes a company's taxes should be normalized.
QUESTION:

That

Mr. Huntington, you're talking

historically, not about this particular proceeding?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

That's right,* historically.

This is back in 1956 or so.
The Commission decided that for ratemaking purposes
the taxes should be normalized.

And by normalized, it means

that they should be calculated as if the company had used
straight-line tax depreciation.
The difference

between the taxes actually paid and

the higher normalized taxes claimed as a cost of service

5

was required to be placed in a special tax reserve account
for the payment of future taxes.
Mowf several years later, the Commission, in the
Alabama-Tennessee case, reconsidered the matter.

It con­

cluded there that the use of accelerated tax depreciation
resulted in a permanent tax savings.
This conclusion was squarely based on the Commissions
finding that the natural gas industry would continue to expand
rapidly for the foreseeable future*

An assumption which is

certainly not true today.
The Commission noted that when an expanding company
uses accelerated tax depreciation, sufficient tax depreciation
deducations on new property are available to offset declining
tax depreciation deductions on old property.
The Commission thus ordered natural gas companies,
using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, to also use
accelerated tax depreciation for ratemaking purposes.

In

this way the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation would
be flowed through to the company's customers.
It's important to note that both the Commission's
normalization order and its flow-through order were upheld by
various Courts of Appeals as being within the Commission's
discretion.
Other regulatory agencies are sharply divided on this
issue.

In short, the matter is a technical one, it turns in

6

large part on an analysis of particular facts pertaining to
given industries, and is precisely the type of question which
falls within the broad discretion that regulatory agencies
have over ratemaking.
This brings us to Section 441 of the Tax Reform Act
of 1969.
As the legislative history of the Act makes clear,
Congress was concerned with the loss of revenues to the govern­
ment resulting from the use of accelerated tax depreciation
by public utilities.
Rather them prohibit the use of accelerate tax
depreciation altogether, Congress chose simply to bar future
shifts to faster methods of depreciation.
With respect to existing or pre-1970 property, the
statute permits the use of,one,straight-line tax depreciation,
two, accelerated depreciation with normalization if the
utility had been using accelerated depreciation when the Act
was passed, and, three, accelerated depreciation with flow­
through if the company had been using flow-through when the
Act was passed.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question:

Does the

record of the — does the legislative history show why
Congress' concern was limited to the impact of accelerated
depreciation only with respect to public utilities?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

No, it doesn't.

Not that I’m aware

7
of.

They did focus on the practice — well, there's a double

revenue loss when -—
QUESTIONj

Well, that's the point.

MR. HUNTINGTON;

Accelerated tax depreciation is

flowed through —
QUESTION: Well now, that's what I want.
MR. HUNTINGTON; There's first the loss resulting
from the increased —
QUESTION:

The tax revenue.

MR. HUNTINGTON;

— deductions.

QUESTION; Because of the higher deductions and —
MR. HUNTINGTON: And then secondly there's —
QUESTION:

— a lower tax revenue.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

— lower rates due to the flow­

through which means that there's less revenues to be taxed by
the — the utilities have less revenues coming in to be
taxed.

Because the benefits are passed on in lower rates.
QUESTION:

I see.

So there's, first of all, a —

I see, I think.
But lower rates to the consumer?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Lower rates to the consumer.

How, similar rules apply to new or post-1969
property, but with respect to new property, which expands a
company's capacity, an additional rule was adopted.

Under

Section 167(1)(4)(A) of the Code, regulated companies on

8

flow-through were given the right to elect not to have flow­
through apply to their expansion property.

As the legislative

history of the statute indicates, the effect of this provision
is to permit companies making the election to use straightline tax depreciation without having to obtain the approval
of the regulatory authority.
In an order upheld by the court below and not an
issue here, the Federal Power Commission announced that as a
general policy it would permit companies making the election
to use normalization on their expansion property.
I come now to this case.

After the Tax Reform Act

was enacted, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation,

a petitioner

here, indicated to the Commission, in a pending rate proceeding,
that it would make the election not to use flow-through on its
expansion property.
The company sought the Commission's permission to use

QUESTION:

What was it going to use?

MR. HUNTINGTON*

Well, it said that it would use —

it sought permission to use normalization on the expansion
property as well as on its existing property.

It said that

if —
QUESTION5 And did the Commission —
MR. HUNTINGTON:

— if the Commission did not give

it permission to use normalization, it would use straight-

9

line —
QUESTION5 Straight-line.
MR. HUNTINGTON* — depreciation on its expansion
property.
The Commission granted the permission, both with
respect to expansion property and existent property. The
Commission found that once Texas Gas had switched to normaliza­
tion on its expansion property, tax depreciation on that
property would no longer be available to offset declining
tax depreciation on existing and replacement property.
The reason it would no longer be available is that
under normalization, benefits from the use of accelerated
depreciation on expansion property are placed in a deferred
tax reserve account, and may only be used to pay future
taxes on the expansion property.
The deferred tax reserve is the very essence of
normalization, and is part of the statutory definition of
normalization in the Tax Reform Act.

That's Section 167(1)

(3)(G), the definition section of the Act.
With expansion property out of the picture, the
Commission concluded that the use of accelerated tax
depreciation on existing and replacement property would no
longer result in a permanent tax savings.
Under these circumstances, the Commission held that
the use of normalization on all of the property of Texas Gas

10

would lead to more stable tax costs for ratemalcing purposes
and would be in the public interest.
The Court of Appeals did not reach the ultimate
merits of the Commission’s order# but held that Section 441
of the Tax Reform Act foreclosed the Commission from permitting
switches from flow-through to normalization.
It is to that issue I will now turn.
There is nothing on the face of Section 441 which
suggests that regulatory agencies may not permit shifts from
flow-through to normalization.

As I have noted# the statute

merely list the permissible methods of tax depreciation in
such a way as to bar shifts from slower to faster methods of
depreciation.
Under the literal terms of the statute# companies
on flow-through qualify for all three methods of depreciation;
that is# straight-line depreciation# accelerated depreciation
with normalization# and accelerated depreciation with flow­
through.
The election provision simply gives the company the
right to elect not to use flow-through on expansion property.
The legislative history of the statute confirms that
the statute does not bar shifts from flow-through to normaliza­
tion with appropriate regulatory agency approval.
The House Report on the initial version# which did
not include the election provision, the House Report describes

11
the effect of the bill in three general rules, the House
Report describes the three general rules.
The third rule in the House Report is that if
flow-through is being used the taxpayer must continue to use
flow-through, quote, "unless the appropriate regulatory agency
permits a change as to that property."
Respondents argue vigorously that this third general
rule referred to in the House Report was displaced by the
election provision.

The election provision was first added

by the Senate to apply to all property, and later restricted
in conference to apply only to expansion property.
It is our submission that the election provision
does not affect a regulatory agency's authority to permit
companies to abandon flow-through.
All the election provision does is to give utilities
the absolute right, without having to go to the agency first,
to get off flow-through.
This was not provided in the House bill.

The only

way an agency could get off flow-through under the House bill
was to get the regulatory agency's approval.
Now, we have quoted the relevant excerpts of the
Senate Report and the Conference Report in our brief, at
pages 23 to 25, and we submit that a reading of those reports
clearly supports our position.
In fact, respondents studiously avoid a direct

12
confrontation with the pertinent provisions of these two
reports which we submit are very pertinent indeed.
Respondents also vigorously argue that certain
language in the House and Senate Reports to the effect that
the legislation would freeze existing depreciation practices
supports their construction of the statute.
The House Report, for example, noted that a require­
ment that all regulated companies revert immediately to
straight-line depreciation would place some regulated companies
at a competitive disadvantage, and would result in widespread
rate increases.
Accordingly, the House Committee had determined,
quote, "in general to freeze the current situation regarding
methods of depreciation."
The short answer to respondents' contention on this
freeze language is that the freeze language appeared first
in the House Report, and was largely copied by the Senate.
But the House Bill, as everyone acknowledges, had
three general rules, so the freeze was obviously subject to
the three general rules.

And, as I have noted, the third

rule explicitly acknowledges that the legislation permits
the abandonment of flow-through with the approval of the
appropriate regulatory authority.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Boland

Thank you, Mr. Huntington,

13
ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHRISTOPHER T. BOLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP TEXAS GAS COMMISSION CORPORATION
MR. BOLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The fundamental error in the court below in this
case has to do with whether or not the election which was
provided by the Senate was in addition to the third rule of
the House of Representatives or whether it was in substitution.
A careful reading of the opinion below and on re­
hearing will show that this is where the court fell in what
we claim to be error.
The position of the respondents in this case is
that it's a substitution; they're supporting the court below.
Our position is that it's clearly an additional method
provided to the taxpayer.
We think that's shown very clearly in the Senate
Report,

In this connection we've set forth the entire

legislative history with respect to Section 441 of the
Tax Reform —
QUESTION: What was Congress' concern that stimulated
this whole change?
MR, BOLAND:

It isn't expressed in terms, but it’s

our feeling that Congress had some concern as to whether the
regulatory agencies would permit a change within the
discretion of the agency, would permit a shift.

14
QUESTION: Well, why did Congress feel that the
existing situation, as administered by the agency, needed 3ome
statutory revision?
MR. BOLAND;

Well, this is clearly established in

the reports of both houses. You Honor; that they were concerned
about the gradual shift and trend to flow-through by companies
that were not on flow-through, the biggest of which was the
telephone company. They were on straight-line depreciation,
and the Federal Communications Commission was threatening
to impute flow-through for regulatory purposes, and the tax
consequence of such an Act would be staggering.

They were

really concerned about the loss of tax revenues and in the
report it shows that they had not intended, really, in passing
the provisions of liberalized depreciation in the 1954 Code,
to have had these benefits passed on to the consumer.
It was intended to give the utilities working
capital in order to invest in new plants.
QUESTION; Well, why then wouldn’t Congress have
simply forced everyone off flow-through for old as well as
new property?
MR. BOLAND: Well, this suggestion was made, Your
Honor, by the then Chairman of the Federal Power Commission,
Chairman White.

And in the report it shows that the Congress

is turning that down because of the objection of several of
the agencies where competitive situations would put the

15
utility at a competitive disadvantage.

They were also

concerned about the fact that this would be mandatory# and
would create widespread rate increases.
QUESTION;

Well# if existing properties were

suddenly put on straight-line or normalization# there would
necessarily be rate .increases# I suppose?
MR. BOLAND:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.
Then# you think this is what was on

Congress' mind?
MR. BOLAND:
establish that.

Oh, I think the reports clearly

They make it pretty clear that they were

concerned# and —
QUESTION: But they weren't concerned enough to
do anything but give the — but give an option?
MR. BOLAND: Well# they had a dilemma# so to speak.
On the one hand# they were -—
QUESTION: Well# I know# but an agency that had been
requiring or looking towards flow-through# what would they do
about existing properties?
MR. BOLAND: Well, they were leaving it to the
discretion of the regulatory agencies individually.
QUESTION: Well# under the views of the regulatory
agencies# they were pretty clear, weren't they?
MR. BOLAND: Well# no, Your Honor, the —
QUESTION: Why not?

16

MR. BOLAND! Some of them were, the Federal Power
Commission’s position —
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BOLAND;

— was fairly clear.

QUESTION; And that's this case.
MR. BOLAND;

That's this case.

But the legislative

history shows that the State Commissions were about equally
divided between flow-through and normalization.

And that

circumstances might change.
For example, here we're confronted in the natural
gas industry, as this Court knows full well, that we've got a
gas shortage, you just had the Louisiana Power and Light case
here.

And this is one of the fundamental premises that the

Commission had when they originally directed flow-through in
the Alabama-Tennessee case.

They anticipated the continued

expansion of the gas industry, and with recognition that gas
reserves were here to last beyond the year 2000,

Well, here

we are short, in 1973.
And the very premise that the Federal Power Commis­
sion had anticipated has fallen by the wayside.
Yet, under the decision of the court below we would
be forever barred from changing from flow-through, notwith­
standing the change in the fundamental principle and concept,
the basic premise of the Federal Power Commission,
But it is clearly shown that the suggestion had been

17
made to make it mandatory, that no utility could use
liberalized depreciation from this point forward.
And they turned that down because of what it might
do competitively,
QUESTION:
MR. BOLAND:

And the rates,
And the widespread rate increase.

It would be automatic, all utilities involved would have to
increase their rates.
Now, there might be some unique situations, like
Texas Gas, where Texas Gas had a rate increase on file, where
we had requested within the discretion of the Federal Power
Commission to go to straight-line depreciation.

The tax

consequence, the rate level to the consumer is exactly the
same as normalization.

As a matter of fact, under the

Commission’s decision it’s a little lower, because they deduct
the reserve from your rate base, so you do get a lower rate.
QUESTION: Section 441 doesn’t by its terms address
itself to the utility rate base, does it?
MR, BOLAND:

No, not — except in one respect.

They do make a comment that they do not intend to preclude
the agency’s discretion from deducting the reserve under
normalization from the rate base.
QUESTION: Well, does the rate base question
necessarily go the same way that tax liability question goes,
then?

18
MR. BOLAND:

No.

In the strict sense, the rate base

is the plant invested in utility, whereas here we’re talking
about an itent of cost of service and expense, which is part
of cost of service.

That tax expense is included in the cost

of service.
The only item in cost of service that directly
relates to rate base is return.

I suppose depreciation, book

depreciation also relates to rate base. But other than that,
you’ve got operating and maintenance expenses, you’ve got
federal income taxes, 3tate taxes, ad valorem taxes, which
goes to the totality of your cost of service upon which your
rates are based.
But if you were to turn to page 82 and 83 of our
main brief, where we've set the legislative history of this
entire Act here, and if you'll look at the lower portion of
page 82, this is the key to the whole decision of the court
below.
Both the House Bill and the committee — this is the
Senate Report? —
QUESTION:
MR. BOLAND:

From what page are you reading?
I'm reading from page 82 of our main

brief, the white brief, which is part of our Appendix.
at the bottom, the last paragraph on the bottom.

And

This is

the Senate Report.
The Senate Report is here making clearrtboth the

19
House bill and the committee amendments" — that is the Senate
Committee amendment that they're sponsoring — "provide that
in the case of existing property the following rules are to
apply;"

"The following rules are to apply."
The third rule is shown on page 83:

"If the taxpayer

is taking accelerated depreciation and flowing through to its
customers the benefits of the deferred taxes, then the tax­
payer would continue to do so" paren "(except as provided
xinder the committee amendments which are discussed below) "
close paren, "unless the appropriate regulatory agency permits
a change as to that property."
QUESTION; Was this addressed to the bill at the time?
MR. BOLAND;

Yes.

What the respondents would do, Your Honor, is have
us just write that out of the report, they ignore it.

They

attempt to make no explanation as to what happened to that
language.

Here is firm, clear language. The Senate is saying

— and this is identical, except for the parenthetical, to the
third rule in the House, as to which the court below said
that if the House bill had been passed the Commission in
Texas Gas would have been clearly justified in doing what
was done.
But here in the Senate Report is precisely the
same provision, and they dissent from it, they disregard it
as though it isn't there.

And somehow the election that was

20

provided by the Senate is supposed to expunge this from the
report.

But we don't see it expunged, it's right there in

black and white.
Now, the parenthetical? you might ask, ‘"What is the
parenthetical referring to?"

The parenthetical refers to the

fact, as you will see if you follow on page 84, they are
referring to the one principal difference. "The committee
amendments, while in most respects the same as the House
provisions, differ in one principal area.

The amendments

permit an election to be made within 180 days."
So, it seems to be perfectly obvious that when it
came out of the House the third rule was there, they all
agree with the third rule.

The court below said, had that

been the law we would have been home free.
QUESTION:

Do you need the consent of the Commission

to do that?
MR. BOLAND:

Oh, yes, under the third rule you

need the consent of the Commission.
QUESTION:
MR. BOLAND:

I know, but not under that language.
Oh, yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Are you **QUESTION: Well, not on the language you read me,
MR. BOLAND: Are you on page 83?
QUESTION:
MR. BOLAND:

I'm on page 82.
82?

Well, if you go over to 83, the

21
third rule is at the top of the page on 83, it's right
opposite 173.
QUESTION:
MR, BOLANDs

Yes.
Mow, if you'd look at the last part

of that, it says "unless the appropriate regulatory agency
permits a change as to that property."
In other words, somebody who is on flow-through,
like Texas Gas was, that we would continue on flowthrough
under the third rule "unless the appropriate regulatory agency
permits a change as to that property."
And that's exactly what's happened here.
Federal Power Commission has permitted a change.

The
And this

is precisely the same language as in the House, again, and I
re-emphasize that in the — the court below said that under
the House language this rule would have —
QUESTION; Well, where is the language that requires
the Commission to give its consent?
MR. BOLAND; At the tail

end of the third rule on

.

page 83.

»

It says "unless the appropriate regulatory agency

permits a change as to that property."
QUESTION; But it wasn't required to give its
permission, the Commission?
MR. BOLAND;
QUESTION;

Oh, no.

No, it was not required.

Yes.

MR, BOLANDs But this is the discretion, this is the

22
— the whole argument before this Court is s

did the election

submerge, obliterate the discretion which the Federal Power
Commission had theretofore clearly had under all the court
decisions to decide what method of tax depreciation should be
used for cost of services in rates.
And we say that under this language in the Senate
Report, that the House version survived the election* it's a
separate thing, it’s not an absolute right as the election is,
it needs the permission of the Commission; it was granted in
this case, and, we submit, properly so.
My time is up.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Boland.
Mr. Morrow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. MORROW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF MEMPHIS LIGHT, GAS AND WATER
DIVISION
MR. MORROW;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I agree with the counsel for the government, Mr.
Huntington, that the issues in this case arise primarily
under the Tax Reform Act of 1969,
The question — the Commission has found that that
Act required one result? the Court of Appeals has found that
the Act required another result.

Really, the question in this

case is; Which of those two results is in conformity with the

23
purpose and intent of Congress in enacting the Tax Reform Act
of 1969?
Specifically, was it the intent and purpose of
Congress, in enacting that Act, to bring about a drastic and
immediate change in the depreciation practices of most of
the utilities in this country, a change which would result in
prompt, substantial, widespread rate increases?
The Court of Appeals, the result reached by the
Court of Appeals is that this was not the intent of Congress.
The result of the Court of Appeals allows the utilities to
take normalized depreciation with respect to their expansion
property, but it leaves the rest of the property exactly the
way it was before, with the same tax practices

in effect as

be fore.
This is precisely what Congress intended.

You can

see that from the face of the Act, and even more clearly it
appears in the legislative history of the Act.
First, the Act itself specifically provides, as
counsel has pointed out, for the election with respect to
post-1969 expansion property.
But let me pause right here to point out that the
Act very narrowly defines post-1969 expansion property.

It

is only that property acquired after 1969 which does not
replace existing property; and which increases the operating
or productive capacity of the utility.

24
Now, in the case of the pipeline industry, that
means that this expansion property, starting at flat zero in
1S70, will grow and, because of the gas shortage which was
mentioned by counsel, this expansion property will probably
grow very slowly.

So the election with respect to expansion

property will have very little practical tax effect or rate
effect for a long time in the future.
Yet that's what's been latched on by the Commission
as a very stubby tail to wag a very large dog.
The Tax Act also expressly provides for the
retention of flow-through depreciation with respect to
property to companies that had been using it in the past.
It twice, with respect to pre-1969 and with respect
— I mean pre-1970 and post-1969 properties, specifically
provides that companies that have been flowing through may
continue to flow through.
The Court of Appeals reached exactly the same
result.
Now, the legislative history makes it clear that
this was all that Congress intended to do.

This and nothing

else.
I think — I'm agreed with my brothers on the other
side concerning the reason for the passage of this Act.

The

utility commissions over the country had been trending toward
flow-through, requiring their utilities to go to flow-through,

25
because this was the way that you minimized utility rates.
You made the companies pay — charge their rates
on the same basis that they paid their taxes; you didn"t give
them any fictitious tax in there, like normalization does.
The only thing wrong with this, from the Treasury's
point of view, was that, as Mr, Huntington said, it also
reduces the taxes paid by the companies.

And the committee

had found that it would soon result in a loss of a billion
dollars and a half to maybe two billion dollars to the Federal
Treasury.
What to do about that loss?

The solutions proposed

to the House was to freeze current tax situations, current
depreciation practices right where they were.
toward flow-through, freeze them.

The trend was

Stop it right there.

And that was all they proposed to do. They did not propose to
reverse the river, but just to freeze it right where it was.
QUESTION:

About the language on page 83, that your

friend was discussing a bit ago, "If the taxpayer is taking
accelerated depreciation and flowing through , , . then the
taxpayer would continue to do so . * . unless the FPC" —
MR, MORROW:

"— permits a change as to that property,"

Or it says "the appropriate regulatory agency".
Your Honor, there might be some circumstances under
which a regulatory agency should take a utility off of flow­
through and put it onto some other kind of depreciation.

26
Flow-through depreciation works, the principle works
when a utility is in an expanding or stable condition, you
see.

As long as its plant is expanding or stable, the flow­

through proposition works.
If a plant were winding down, then it would be
appropriate for the

regulatory commission to take it off

flow-through.
So there are circumstances in which a regulatory
commission should do that.
QUESTION; Well, isn't that exactly what this tells
us?

Did you seem to suggest some doubt about what regulatory

agency it would be?
MR. MORROW; Well, I'm just saying that this applies
not only to the Federal Power Commission, but it applies to
all the regulatory agencies.
QUESTION;

I see.

But there's no doubt that it

only means Federal Power in this case?
MR. MORROW;

Oh, yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

It includes

that.
But the Federal Power Commission, and the Court of
Appeals recognized that there might be circumstances under
which a change from flow-through would be justified.

And I

think that's all that the — that this reference has to do
with it.
m

As a matter of fact, on the face of the Act itself,

27
there is no such provision about a regulatory agency
permitting the change.

You don't find that in the Act,

That's

just a comment on the part of the people who were working
on the Act,

And —

QUESTION:

But any change to flow-through would,

of course, be beneficial from the point of view of Congress’
concern at the time of the 1969 Act, because it would serve to
increase taxes,
MR. MORROW: But — yes? Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Because it would be a change either to

normalization or to straight-line.
MR. MORROW: But, Your Honor, Congress had two
concerns, of equal value to it, at that time.

One of the

concerns was that we stop the trend to flow-through,
QUESTION: Right.
MR. MORROW: The other concern was that we do it
without creating widespread, prompt, substantial rate —
utility rate increases.
Now, this —
QUESTION:

But your position is that the Commission

had no power to let this — to permit a change?
MR. MORROW: We believe that it had no discretion to
do what it did in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

it does have discretion.

And that rule (3) seems to say that
So you —

28
MR. MORROW:

Not under the circumstances of this

case.
QUESTION:

So you must say, then, that this piece

of legislative history just must be disregarded in terms of
the plain language of the Act?
MR. MORROW:

No, Your Honor, I don’t say that.

I

say that that piece of legislative history has its place under
a proper fact situation
QUESTION: Well, then, —
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

— but this is not a fact situation.
— then are we just here reviewing the

discretion of the Commission?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

I thought it was the power —

No, Your Honor, —
I thought it was a power question.

MR. MORROW:

We — under the circumstances of this

case, the Commission had no discretion to do what it did.
QUESTION: But the Court of Appeals opinion wasn't
phrased in terms of a review of discretion at all, as I read
it.

It simply said categorically the Commission couldn't do

this.
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Now it seems to me you're taking a

little different tack.
MR. MORROW: And it said so on two bases:

first, on

its reading of the Act itself; and, secondly, on the proposi-

29

tion that the Federal Power Commission has an absolute legal
duty to allow in cost-of-service nothing more than actual
taxes, the real tax expense.
And this, we say, is the principle that was
violated by the Federal Power Commission in this case; and
that's why the Commission is wrong.
QUESTION:

And so that — for the same reason Rule

(3) is wrong?
MR, MORROW:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that Rule

(3) is — of course it's not wrong; it's the law,
QUESTION:

Or to put it another way;

doesn't Rule

(3) fly in the face of what you have just said?
MR. MORROW:

No, sir.

Thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart, it doesn’t.
Because there are circumstances under which it might be proper
for a utility commission to move a company off of flow­
through, and then —
QUESTION:

Again then, we are here just reviewing

the decision of the Commission as to whether the circumstances
are proper in this case?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION;
MR, MORROW:

Your Honor, —
Is that what the issue is here?
I believe that under the circumstances

of this case, -QUESTION:

Perhaps you better tell us what the

30
Commission wanted to do in this case.
MR, MORROW % All right.

Here’s what the Commission

— well, all right.
What the Commission wants to do in this case — and
may I say something before I get to that?

I definitely want

to get to that.
But, you see, in the course of the legislation,
the passage of the legislation through Congress, first,
Chairman White of the Commission came up to Congress and
said, "We'd like to have everything just put on straight-line
depreciation."
The Congress turned down that request, for the
reason that, in addition to the one mentioned by Mr. Boland,
for the reason that, to put everybody on straight-line would
result in prompt, substantial, widespread utility rate
increases.
And Congress did not want prompt rate increases to
come into effect, and so they turned him down.
Now, Mr. Justice White, if the Commission should
win this case, under the Commission's decision in this case
we reach almost exactly the same situation that we would have
reached under Chairman White's suggestion.
The utilities would charge their rates on the basis
of straight-line depreciation, but pay their taxes on the
basis of accelerated depreciation.

And for rate purposes,

31
you would in effect have straight-line depreciation.

It's

not quite the sane, but it’s almost the same.
And this is what Chairman White suggested, and this
is what they turned down.
Now, when they did that, they thought that they had
accomplished their purpose without putting any rate into —
any law into effect which would cause rate increases in the
utilities.
They said that the bill would forestall the revenue
loss which the continuation of existing trends would make
almost inevitable, and that it would do so, quote, "in a way
which, with very few exceptions, will require no increase in
utility rates because of the tax loss."
QUNSTIONs

Well, isn't it one thing to say that

the Tax Reform Act wasn't going to cause rate increases,
and another thing to say that by its terms it prohibited
Commission action which might have permitted rate increases?
MR. MORROW %

Your Honor, I believe that it was the

intent of Congress to accomplish the freeze and to accomplish
it in such a way as to avoid rate increases.
I believe that the action of the Commission, not
only unfreezes but it drastically revolutionizes utility
practices, and does so in a way

which causes rate increases.

In other words, the result reached by the Commission
is precisely the opposite of the result which Congress sought.

32
Now, leti we point this out:

When the bill got

into the Senate, someone in the Senate suggested, Let's give
the pipelines or the utilities the power or election to
change to, away from, to abolish flow-through depreciation
with respect to all of their properties.
Abolish

flow-through with respect to all the

properties.
Now, if that had happened, you would have almost
exactly the same situation that you have under the Act as it
was passed — I mean under the Act as it was construed by the
Commission.
The Commission said this little election with
respect to expansion property puts us in a position where,
for all practical purposes, we've got to allow the pipeline
to go on and normalize as to

all its properties; we have no

alternative.
That's the Commission's position in this case.
We are forced into it by the practicalities of the situation.
So what the Commission is saying, that an election
with respect to the expansion properties is tantamount, for
all practical purposes, to an election with respect to all
properties.

This is precisely what the Senate proposed to

put in the Act and which the Congress turned down.
So, twice this matter was considered.

Twice, the

Congress turned it down; the Commission has now reached the

33

very result which Congress turned down.
Let me address myself to the reason why X think that
the Commission does not have the discretion to do what it did.
First, —
QUESTION;

That gets us back, then, to the

discussion of discretion and not power.
MR. MORROW; Well, —
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION;
MR. MORROW;

Or are you — did you misspeak yourself?
No — all right, let's talk about —
— on the legislation.
— the Commission.

In terms of the

Commission's power.
The Commission is under the duty, as the court
below said, to allow a tax cost in the cost of service
which is no greater than actual taxes. The court said, There
is nothing in the Tax Reform act of 1969 which modifies the
Commission's duty under the Natural Gas Act to require
regulated utilities companies, such as Texas Gas, to set
rates which reflect actual expenditures with respect to such
property.

"To set rates which reflect actual expenditures."
Now, the Commission does not have discretion, then,

to grant a utility a tax allowance in its cost of service,
it doesn't have power to grant a utility a cost of — an
allowance in its cost of service for taxes which are not paid.
In other words, it does not have power to treat as a

34
cost something which in fact is not a cost.
QUESTION:

That depends not at all on Section 441,

to that part of your argument.
MR. MORROW: That's right, Your Honor. That is the
law under the Natural Gas Act, as the Court of Appeals held.

,

And as this Court held in United Gas Pipe Line vs. FPC which
was a tax case.

And which Mr. Justice White is familiar with.

In that case the Court said that the Commission had
the power and the duty to limit the cost of service to real
expenses.
Now, in this case, Texas Gas' normalization on its
little tag of esqpansion property is not going to increase its
depreciation — not going to decrease its depreciation by one
dime.

Now or ever.

It's not going to increase its income

taxes with respect to depreciation by one dime, now or ever*
The only effect that it will have will have will be
to put more money in Texas Gas' pockets.
Texas Gas gets to charge a higher rate, because of
normalization with respect to this little piece of expansion
property, and it gets to pocket the difference.
And the Commission is in the position of saying that
because Texas Gas gets increased revenues, with respect to
its expansion property, therefore, in order to keep it even,
in order to keep it whole, it's got to get increased revenues
on a large scale with respect to its $600 million worth of

35

depreciable rate base.
There is no increase in Texas Gas* taxes as a result
of its going to normalized depreciation on its expansion
property.
Therefore, we say that the Commission had no power
to give it an additional return or an additional amount in
its cost of service to do this.
We say that if we do, that if you do you have
accomplished precisely what Congress was attempting to avoid.
Congress said, Let's freeze the situation and avoid tax rate
increases; the effect of the Commission's decision is to
unfreeze the situation and drastically change tax practices
and do so at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars
of utility rate increases throughout the United States.
QUESTION:

In your response to Justice White, then,

just what did you have in mind when you said that under some
circumstances they would have discretion, the Commission would
have discretion?
MR. MORROWs
tion.

Your Honor, this is just an illustra­

The whole concept, as I'm sure Your Honor knows, because

you were on the Panhandle case and the City of Chicago case,
the whole concept of normalized depreciation is that it works
when the company is in an expanding condition, or its
depreciable base is at least stable.

Then the principle of

flow-through depreciation, where your new properties coming

36
in offset your old properties which are declining in value,
that principle works.
It would not work with a pipeline which, because of
the gas shortage or whatever, was winding down its activities.
And therefore if a corporation —* if a tax —* if a utility,
or particularly a pipeline, were caught in a winding-down
condition, where its depreciable property was actually decreasing,
then this would not be applicable.
But let me point out that there is not one shred of
evidence in this case, not a shred of evidence that Texas Gas'
property is going to be, is going to wind down or decrease.
As a matter of fact, there is — the question of
normalization was never even considered in the trial of this
case. Texas Gas didn’t ask for it, when it filed its return;
nobody put in any evidence on it; there is not a shred of
evidence in this case about the effects of normalization on
Texas Gas.
So we say that what the Commission has done is to
— Your Honor, I thought I was going to be given a light; have
I overstepped my colleague's —
QUESTION;
MR. MORROW:

You were given a red light at this minute.
I was going to be given a white light,

and I didn't —
QUESTION;
MR. MORROW:

Oh.
— see it.

I hope I haven't over-

37
stepped my colleague's time, because I was to leave —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
ten minutes remaining.

You have not, he has

But if you have something important,

we'll be flexible about this and enlarge your friend's time
accordingly, if he needs it.
MR. MORROW:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I just will summarize by saying this:
That Congress had a specific problem in mind, the
problem was to avoid further tax losses by stemming the flow
toward flow-through.

It had two purposes in mind, the other

one was to do so without causing utility rate increases.
The result reached by the Commission in this case
causes enormous utility rate increases all over the country?
the result reached by the Court of Appeals causes no increases,
and exactly coincides with the intent and purpose of
Congress.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solomon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SOLOMON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF
NEW YORK
MR. SOLOMON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court:
There may be some confusion here as to what the
issues in this case are.

38
There are two issues in this case, and they’ve been
put into this case by idle United States.
The first issue is whether the Court of Appeals was
correct in construing the Tax Act as precluding the Commission
from considering the request by Texas Gas.
And the second issue is whether, assuming the
Commission has authority, continuing authority to consider
the question, whether it considered it properly.
There are two issues here.

They've been put into

this case by the United States, and they have been accepted by
us.
It is true that only one of them was decided by
the court below, but both parties to this proceeding are
suggesting that you can decide the second issue if you reach
it.
Now, I haven't got enough time to spend much time
on the basic decision of the court below, but I do want to say
one thing in response to Justice White.
The Court of Appeals did not believe that if the
situation had been left as it was at the time of that Senate
Report, that Mr. Boland read you, that the Commission would
have been precluded.

The Court of Appeals decision is based

on the entire history of what happened, and specifically
based upon the limitation of the election by the conference.
QUESTION* So that the report really doesn't speak to

39
the Act as finally passed, you're suggesting?
MR. SOLOHONs

The report speaks to the Senate Bill

then before them.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SOLOMON*

The conference limited it.

And the

Court of Appeals thought that was significant; and I think
it's significant, but you’ll have to look at ray brief for
that point, because I would really, in the limited time I have,
like to go on to the exercise of power, assuming they had
any power.
New, the United States hasn’t said very much about
this.

They would like you to believe that discretion is the

end of the argument, that because an agency obviously has a
great deal of discretion in general to decide what the
parameters of its ratemaking principles are, that if they
decide for flow-though, that that's all that has to be —
that you have to worry about.
But if there is one thing in this complex tax law
which is clear, if an agency chooses to fix the rates of a
utility on the conventional cost-of-service basis, it may
include a tax allowance, but that tax allowance is to be to
the extent it is possible to calculate it the actual taxes
paid, and not theoretical taxes.
And when the Federal Power Commission and other
agencies have from time to time attempted to include in the

40

rates of the company fictitious tax allowances, they have been
regularly slapped down by the Court.
The problem with respect to liberalized depreciation
is whether its use involves a tax deferral or a tax saving.
If it involves a tax deferral, then the actual taxes are not
what you pay in the particular year, the tax accrued is a
higher amount, although you're allowed to defer part of it.
And under such circumstances it would be appropriate to allow
normalization.
But the fact of the matter is that you do not pay
taxes on the basis of the situation with respect to individual
pieces of property or individual groups of property.

You pay

taxes on the entire tax obligation of the regulated utility,
and,from the depreciation standpoint, on the depreciation
status of the entire utility.

And this, as the Commission

found in the Alabama-Tennessee case, means that with respect
to a growing or stable company, the lower taxes on later
vintages of property will be more than sufficient to counteract
the higher taxes on earlier vintages of property, with the
result that you will have a constantly growing tax surplus.
Now, that's what happened to Texas Gas, when it
was allowed to normalize prior to 1967.

As a result, it comes

into this case with $13 million of reserve, which nobody can
claim is not related to the old property.
It will, as a result of the right given it by

41
Congress, the special right given it by Congress, by Section
441, be entitled to accrue additional reserves, which are in
fact interest-free loans, with respect to new expansion
property.
But the fact that it is accruing additional interestfree reserves has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or
not Texas Gas" use of liberalized depreciation on old property
and new property, which is what it's been doing, will cease
to be a tax saving.

It was using liberalized depreciation on

all its property, and because it was a growing company it
resulted in tax savings.
It will use liberalized depreciation in the future
on all its property, and if it is a growing or stable company,
it will still be a tax saving.
Now, what

about this gas supply shortage, and

everything like that?
There are areas for Commission expertise.

One area

for Commission expertise could be a finding based on evidence,
substantial evidence, but certainly one you give some weight
to, saying that the industry has changed and this company or
other companies are not going to be growing companies and
therefore the factual situation is changed.
Now, if that was the posture in which this case
came to you, then you obviously, unless the Commission's
determination was clearly not based on the record, would have

42
a very difficult problem if you want to reverse them.

But

that is not the way this case comes to you.
On the contrary, the Commission assumes — it
more than assumes; they found, in Order 578, that Texas Gas
was going to continue to grow.
And I am citing from page 110 of the record, about
two lines, three lines below the numeral 2747, and here is
what they say:
This is the Commission, this isn't me.
"While Texas Gas* pre-1970 properties may represent
a declining net investment, the company will undoubtedly be
adding to its entire rate base by post-1969 construction."
They didn't find that the gas supply shortage, or
anything else, had changed the situation which meant this was
a tax savings rather than a tax deferral.
What they found was that because the Commission now
has the right — pardon me — because Texas Gas now has the
right to keep a portion of the tax savings, i.e„, the increasing
amount on their new expansion property, that that somehow
converted the situation from a tax saving to a tax deferral
thing.
But we submit to you that there is nothing in the
Act, nothing in the Commission's rules, and nothing in common
sense which says that because a company has the temporary use
of an interest-free loan, that means that its use of liberal-

43
ized depreciation is going to become a tax deferral rather
than a tax saving.

It only means that if, at some unforeseen

and unexpected and certainly not found on this record, future
date there was some need for use of this fund, and over and
above the 13 million they already have for use, it only means
that there would be additional ways of meeting this possible
but not found future contingency.
So, our basic position in this cases

Assuming —

assuming that the court below was wrong in saying that the
Commission was precluded from considering this request, is
that its resolution of the matter was in error.

And if

you will read the Commission's decision, you will find that
its sole reason for finding there is no tax saving is this
assumption that because part of the tax savings will be put
into this fund, they’re not available.
They don't have to be available, in the first place;
and in the second place, if it was necessary they could be
made available.
The only other thing I'd like to say is that Mr*
Huntington says that normalization has to be put into a
reserve fund*

We will grant that, although the House Report

suggests that isn’t true.
But there's nothing in the bill or anything else
that says when it goes into a fund it can't be used for future
use.

That's what deferred taxes are for.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Huntington.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION.
MR. HUNTINGTONS
power issue.

I'd like to talk first about the

And then I have a few remarks to say about the

Commission's exercise of discretion in this case.
When Mr. Morrow conceded that there may be certain
circumstances under which the Commission could permit an
abandonment of flow-through, with respect to existing
property, I think he conceded this point.
That is precisely our position, that it's a matter
of Commission discretion, that this is what the third rule
in the House provided.

It left this type of thing up to the

Commission,
The only thing the election provision did was to
give the companies an absolute right, without getting
regulatory agency approval, to get off flow-through.
Now, the language in the Senate Report is pertinent,
because it was the Senate that added the election provision.
And the language in the Report shows:that in adding it it did
not mean to displace the third rule.
QUESTION:

Now, you presented this argument to the

Court of Appeals on rehearing, or — this very argument here?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
it to the Court of Appeals.

Yes, on power; oh, sure, we argued

45
QUESTION?

And the Court of Appeals specifically

thought that the conference had run around this —MR. HUNTINGTON: The Court of Appeals stressed
certain language in the conference report, which I don’t
think I'll go into here, but it is — we do come to grips
with that issue rather sjuarely in our brief.

And we think

that it's just a total misreading of the conference report;
and that we must rely on the Senate Report here.

And that

in merely narrowing the election from existing property to
expansion property, the conference certainly did not mean
to negate the general rule referred to in the House and the
Senate Reports.
I would like to now turn to the — assuming that the
Commission has the power, was it properly exercised in this
case?
Now, both respondents here and in their briefs
talk about the actual-taxes doctrine.
Well, the actual-taxes doctrine has never been
thought, or never been held to preclude the Commission from
exercising its discrimination in how to treat liberalized
tax depreciation for ratemaking purposes.
It is largely a question of whether the taxes
result in a — whether the use of liberalized depreciation
results in a tax deferral or a tax savings.
Now, if we could consider all of Texas Gas' property

46
together, then we would have a different case than we have here.
Then you would continue assuming that Texas Gas continued to
expand, you would have — you would be able to use the benefits
from the expansion property with respect to the old property.
But Congress made the segregation. Congress said,
With respect to expansion property you can get off floxtf-through?
you can go to straight-line.

And if you can get the agency*s

approval, you can go to normalization.
So Congress segregated these types of property. So
you cannot consider the tax benefits from the expansion
property in determining what method of accounting to apply to
the existing property for ratemaking purposes.
The whole concept of normalization is that you take
the benefits and you put them into a reserve account.
are not available for anything else.

They

They are in that account

so tliat you can pay future taxes with respect to that property.
QUESTIONS

When you say you put them in a particular

account, does that connote an actual deposit of funds?
MR, HUNTINGTONS

No, it's a —

It's an accounting.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

It's an accounting thing,

If you're just

talking about an accounting of these,

You've collected it from somebody.

MR. HUNTINGTON: That's right.
QUESTION: For ratemaking purposes it would be
treated, would it, the same way as depreciation, or reserves
of other kinds? How would it be treated?
MR. HUNTINGTON: Well, for ratemaking purposes the
amount is deducted from the rate base, so that it essentially
is ■—

It's treated as an expense, as taxes

that you've actually paid, but you haven't.
MR. HUNTINGTON:
haven't paid.

TVs you've actually paid and you

That's right.

But because Congress specifically said, All right,
you can use this method on expansion property? it is Congress
that has made this segregation. And therefore you have to
look just at the existing property in determining what method

48

to use there.

And there we say the Commission was correct in

determining that the use of flow-through was no longer
appropriate, and had full discretion — this is a matter
completely within the Commission’s discretion to analyze
these facts —
QUESTION:

If they get so far within the discretion

of the Commission, that it doesn't have to say why it did it?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

It said why it did it.

QUESTION: Well, why did it?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

It did it because, with respect to

existing property, there would no longer be sufficient
deductions to offset the declining balances on the existing
property.

Prom year to year the tax depreciation deductions

would decline.
Therefore, instead of having a tax savings with
respect to that property, it's merely a tax deferral.

To

pass it on in the form of lower rates now would simply mean
that the present customers are paying a tax expense which the
— are getting a tax benefit at the expense of future
customers, who would then have to pay the increased taxes.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:14 o'clock, a.n,, the case was
submitted.]
