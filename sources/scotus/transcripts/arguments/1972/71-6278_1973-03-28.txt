NR., CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:■

We will hear arguments next

in 71-6278» Almeida-Sanchez against the United States.
Mr. Cleary.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CLEARY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEARY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case concerns the application of the
Fourth Amendment to interior searches.
More specifically, the petitioner contends that the
nature and extent of this search permitted by Immigration
regulation is in conflict with the Fourth Amendment, the
Carroll decision and the litany of precedent following that
decision.
Basically, can the Government authorize a regulation
that permits a search of an automobile on a highway without a
warrant, and more specifically, without probable cause?
That is the issue.

Q

Does the issue invoke necessarily the constitutional

validity of the statute?
MR. CLEARY:

No, Your Honor, I think that this Court

under its general mandate, if it could construe the statute so
as to find it constitutional, would do so.
However, I think the regulation would fall.

4
The question is what is reasonable distance.

And I

think the Court would have to make it eminently clear what
reasonable distance is to adjudicate this particular issue.
Q

Would we fix that, Mr. Cleary, in terras of 37^ miles,

or would we say a reasonable distance in the context of the
geographical area in which it occurred?

Which way would we

phrase that?
MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor is really faced with a tough

decision in that area and I would suggest that in reviewing the
Glazu decision, where it was a pier search, Judge Browning in his
dissent in this case called it a substantial equivalent.
I would, if the Court would permit, suggest a decision
that has a judicial import and not a legislative one so as to
try to quanitify it.
That decision — after reading the decisions in this
case and many others, I would suggest would be that distance
necessary for the customs to make the first practical contact
with the entrant after crossing the border.

*

Now, with that definition, you can apply it so as to
take care of the situation where the man flies from Acupulco
to Chicago, or the man is in the immediate proximity of the area
and he outruns the border inspector.
But at the other end of the scale, which I would
contend that this continuous surveillance technique, and as
modified in the Alexander case, called a substantial continuous

5
surveillance, because you can have some interruption, ray
suggested rule would be a one-shot rule, meaning that if the
law enforcement officers allow the person to pass through
customs and he clears it, then any search thereafter must be
based upon probable cause.
If the Government, having reliable informants, and
having, say, corroboration under Draper or the other decisions
of this Court, will then contend that they can arrest the
person once into the interior if further information has been
corroborated, would have probable cause and wouldn't need the
subterfuge of a border search.
So, I would suggest to the Court that a definition of
border search is possible,to quanity it, I think, Is next to
impossible because I could be searched all right now under the
existing regulation if I got into an automobile and were to drive
to National Airport on the ground that I might be from a country,
say of Ireland or some other basis, and they were looking for
other Irish people in the vehicle.
Q

Had your client passed through Customs here,

Mr. Almeida-Sanchez?
MR. CLEARY:

There was some question there. Your

Honor — in that one Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because the first
statement was on being inquired of it, he said, "I picked up the
car in

Calexico,5 which is in the interior of the United States,

whereas another sta tenent of the Customs man when he stopped him

!!I came from Mexicali," could have meant he sas born in

Si.ids

Mexicali, and, of course, as his Immigration card was marked
indicated that he did have some residence in Mexicali, but
there is no evidence, I would contend in this record, of a
border entry.
And, again, the point it we have to look a veniflo
at the stop on the highway.

That officer did not know whether

the man had cleared the border and made the stop.

This was

just a random sampling, using his own rule of thumb, whatever
discretion, whim, caprice,he had in stopping an automobile.
Q

Your statement of the rule, I thought, was —• had as

a part of the rule that when a man lias cleared Customs then
there were to be certain limits — probable cause limits.

And

I was wondering how that rule would apply to this particular
case.
MR. CLEARY:

In this case, since there was no border

entry observed, the only way that vehicle could be stopped on
the highway,consistent with the Carroll decision, is upon
probable cause.
Q

You say the burden of proof then is on the Government

to show that he had not come through Customs, rather than the
burden of proof on him to show that he did?
MR. CLEARY:

I think the burden of proof would be on

the Government, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if they were seeking,
one, an exemption of the warrant requirement, and two, an

7
exemption of the probable cause requirement.

X think that

would be eminently fair.
Q

If he didn’t coxae through Customs* then wouldn’t his

strong position be that he is just a local fellow who was out
for a ride and he had never been to Mexico in his life?
MR, CLEARY!

Well, Your Honor, that would possibly be

his contention but the more important issue is the stopping of
the vehicle to make this type of search.
What is not before the Court right now is an interstifcial area known as the founded suspicion situation, where
a vehicle might be briefly detained on the highway so that the
officer can make some initial questions or check of the man.
That's not an issue here.
And if I could point out two other serious aspects of
this case.

The Government in its total candor,which has always

been the position,has cited to you not only the rule that permits
up to 100 air miles, but 287.1 § v points out that the Immigra­
tion director can go beyond the 100 mile limit if he so desires.
So that the 100 mile is not a stop.
And the second point —
Q

Well, that certainly, I think, you already conceded

would take care of the situation where an airplane flies non­
stop from London to St. Louis.
MR, CLEARY;

Yes, Your Honor, in the sense of not

permitting a search, though, of this random search as they are

8
now interpreting it.
Q
it?

Well v has all sorts of steaming safeguards, doesn't

It's got the district director has to forward a complete

report with respect to the matter to the commissloner and
justify anything more than 100 miles.
MR, CLEARY:

If I cart point out another serious

constitutional defect in the regulation, is that this Court
in Coolidge v. New Hampshire struck down an attorney general
acting with another hat as justice of the peace, issuing out
his own search warrant.
Does it not seem anomalous to this Court that here
we have the Attorney General defining what is reasonable
distance, or what is the exempted area of the Fourth Amendment,
And so, for the Executive to take that type of role
in cutting down a Fourth Amendment application, and, as I point
out to the Court, the Fourth Amendment does not have, first of
all, an exception in it for the border.
But this Court, in the Carroll case, held that as
the Fourth Amendment will be interpreted at the time of its
adoption, certainly border searches are proper, but if I were
counsel for the establishment in 1776 in this country and was
thinking of ways in which to draft legislation or rules to
authorise a writ of assistance, I wouldn't do a better job
than what we have right here in this regulation.
And I would suggest to the Court that it is not the

9

authority of the Executive to so limit, define, contract, the
Fourth Amendment.

It applies throughout the United States and

I think it is the function of this Court to uphold it.
Q

Does not the regulation by its terns apply to border

crossers?
MR. CLEARY:

Mo, Your Honor, it applies to you can

search any vehicle, meaning anyone's vehicle, Your Honor’s
vehicle could be down the highway and technically under this
regulation you could be stopped and not only you questioned, out
your vehicle searched, and the trunk opened up.

And in the

case we have in point, to show you how far they have gone,under
the seat, and there are even Minth Circuit cases where they have
looked in paper bags for aliens and the court held that, of
course, that was not a proper place to look for aliens,or
in four-inch crevices and in other places.

But it shows the

potential for abuse in such searches.
I would further point out, and I would like to cite
to the Court an additional authority, a Ninth Circuit opinion
written by Judge Hoffstedler.

It is U.S. v. Mailides. M-a-i-1-

i-d-e-s, its slip opinion only, 721898, and it was decided on
the 22nd of January.

And there, six Mexican-appearing individ­

uals driving down a highway in a Chrysler automobile stared
straight ahead as a patrol car passed them.

They were stopped

and they were interrogated, and the court there reviewed that
this was, of course, an improper stop.

10
And the reason I raise this is that such a regulation
or its implementation,can be clearly discriminatory in its
application.

That is to say, even the Government's brief at

page 24 in the footnote in the last line points out that these
stops on a random sampling are made on apparent nationality.
Well, I don't know ho*» one can physically observe
one's nationality other than to use certain racial or color
characteristics.
Q

How else would you do it at the border between

Mexico and Che United States, though?
MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor, at that border between Mexico

and the United States, there are a great deal of Mexican-Araerican
people.

There are a lot of people here legally,
I think that the stop for aliens — and that's a

reasonable alternative in this case — is to apply the protec­
tive and preventative measures at the border.
If you look at our border, there is just holes in the
fence all the way along.
2,000 mile3 of border.

The Government contends there is
There is 4,000 on Canada.

And they've

got 1400 out of their 1700 border patrol officers down on the
Mexican border.
The question is — and I think appropriately -- they
are stopped at the border.

And if we don't have, so to speak,

a preventative policing of the border then we should not allow
the pious pragmatism of the Government to lay back and claim

11
inherent exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to stop all vehicles.
Q

Is there any estimate of how many people it would take

to cover that 2,083 mile border, the kind of mechanism you are
suggesting?
MR. CLEARY:
our U.S. Attorney.

I have made suggestions, Your Honor, to

In fact, one of the suggestions I made was

that we are having how many of our Armed Forces returning from
Vietnam, and one of the suggestions I had is that, properly be
armed and brought into an auxiliary capacity,could be an
excellent device to act as a constabulary, something every other
country in the world lias but our own.
And, in any event, I do not see the advantages of
place in this.

Now, the essential question is, why should we

even have a border patrol at all.
moral question.

I mean that's a very serious

And I can't answer that.

legal framework now.

I am only in the

But if you are asking for ways in which

to supply that manpower, I would suggest, notwithstanding the
fact I might not be philosophically in line with that type of
policing, I would say that that resource would be available.
I further would point out that one of the other
problems in these types of searches is, we are not dealing with
a minor intrusion.
ment.

We are not dealing with a licensing require­

We are dealing with a serious look for evidence, evidence

of a crime.
The Government has cited the See, Camara * Colonnade

12
and Blswell decisions.

I would suggest to the Coijert that those are readily
dis tinguishable»
Q

Would you give me the spelling of Ms Hides, please,

and the date again, January what?
MR. CLEARY:
M-a-l-l~i-d-e-s.

January 22nd, Your Honor.

It is

And if the Court would like an analysis of

border searches in a recent opinion by Judge Dunaway, I would
cite U.S. v, Petersen. P~e-t~e-r-s-e~n.

That's 72-2123, and

that was decided 18th of January and is also in a slip opinion.
In this case, there was not a momentary detention,
and the possibility for a subterfuge for something other than
just an alien check, as in this case, is just paramount.
I would point out that in dealing with the Camara
and See cases, we had situations where a warrant was required.
It was lie Id not only was a man’s residence protected to a
certain degree, even though the probable cause requirement
could be dropped, but also a business.
In the Colonnade and Biswell cases, I would tender
tothe Court four
in

basic distinctions.

First, the group involved

that area is a self-defined target group, that is to say,

men who have chosen their particular occupation, firearms or
the liquor business.

Two, that in this business venture, there

is not the justifiable expectation of privacy one would expect
in an automobile.

And when the statute and regulation here says

13

vehicle, that would include also van.

It would include camper,

which is kind of like a quasi-home and a mobile home, which
might be a person’s only horae on the highway.
Second of all, I would indicate that the searches
in Colonnade and Biswell were of business estaolishraents during
daylight hours.
In this case, it x$as a shortly after midnight stop on
a highway.

It's very personal in nature when you start to go

through a man's vehicle, which this Court with Justice Jackson,
in Brinegar, has defined as one of the effects, the automobile
itself that he was driving on a highway.
I would daresay that there are reasonable alternatives
to the rule that is posed here.
The first one is greater registration requirements.
There is now a requirement that aliens register in January.
I would suggest that one, on employers -- if registration was
required by employers, it would be a great way to alleviate the
burden of the illegal aliens in this country.
Sometimes we don't consider cause and effect.
are these aliens here?

Why

And a little application of common

sense logic would indicate that if we had some type of regis­
tration or kind of control in that area, we might alleviate
some of the problems.
Second one, on welfare.
Third, I would suggest even licensing activities.

14

One of the best detectives for aliens in our area happens to be
the California Department of Motor Vehicles, because people
come in and don’t have this evidence and it is determined that
they are here illegally.
Q

Mr. Cleary, as long as you’ve got into these practical

tilings, you probably, since you live down there, recall that^ at
one point,they tried making a search of every car coming across
the border and provoked, as you will recall, an international
incident.

Mexico wouldn’t stand for it and a great many other

people wouldn't.
There are practical difficulties that are hard to
cross over, aren't there?
MR. CLEARY:
indicate that.

Yes, Your Honor, and I am not trying to

I am saying that, given the balancing of the

interests here, that at the border when Operation Intercept
was in operation on Customs it backed up things a long ways.
I might add to the Court that they’ve been substantially
improved at the Tiajuana border they have a very expeditious
way of processing.

However, I think the answer lies in applying

the border search at the border.
And, further, on the doctrine of pragmatism, I would
suggest to the Court its own opinion in United States v. IJ.S.
District Court.

In that case, this Court, where the Government

contended a very strong issue, national security, this Court
not only, of course, required the probable cause for wire tapping,

15

but even went further and said, "He are not going to allow you
to use that pragmatic approach to excuse even the warrant
requirement."
And all we are asking for here is once a vehicle is
In the interior and it is on the highways, should not the
Government be required to have at least probable cause?
Some of the other reasons why this Court should be
concerned with this particular rule because of the dichotomy
that exists as between contraband and aliens.
On one hand, the introduction of this noxious control
substance, be it marijuana, heroin or any of the other narcotics,
is a national interest, a super concern,

in fact, in ray humble

opinion, far more important than the question of a man from
another country seeking a better way of life in our country,
and that under the application of the law as it now stands
there must be probable cause once the vehicle clears the border
area or the immediate border area.
And, as Judge Browning points out^ in his dissent,
this strange dichotomy — and 1 might point out to the Court
that the statute used here is not as liberal as the Customs
satutes which are 19-482 and 19-1581.

They are far more liberal.

Yet the Circuit and other Circuits have held to allow those
statutes to operate without probable cause would fly in the face
of the Fourth Amendment.

But for aliens, we make an exception.

I feel that that's not a fair balancing of the issue.

16
Second, X would point out that we can sometimes, in
our Federal system, learn from the States.
Chief Justice Roger Trainer, California Supreme
Court, a well known national jurist familiar with criminal law,
wrote well on thi3 decision when dealing with sheriffs who tried
to justify a border search for a vehicle.

In fact, they might

have had something that might have almost amounted to founded
suspicion, when the man had a dented fender.

And in People v.

Gale, cited here in the Government’s brief, the court held that
such a search would be intolerable and took the Carroll decision
of this Court to find by State officers couldn’t do it.
So, on one hand, we have State officers who can’t
conduct such searches, but on the other hand we have Federal
officers with this unlimited power.
Q

Well, but isn’t that a consequence of the fact that

the Federal Government has the explicit control of the borders
in the example you give?
MR. CLEARY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor —

The Government can't permit each one of the border

States to have its own customs control, could they?
MR. CLEARY:

Ho, sir, that is correct.

that a border search requires a border entry.

X only contend

And in this case

a border entry was not established, and also the type of search
conducted here on the highways would apply anywhere in the
United States when it almost covered the majority of the existing

17
population in those United States.
And, although the Government does point out that it
would not exercise that power Co conduct searches, say, in
Times Square, New York City, the Fourth Amendment does not
rely upon the good will of the Executive.

It is an absolute

oar, and that If there was some type of nexus shown with the
border prior to the stop, a different situation might exist.
And, I might also point out to the Court we are not
dealing with the founded suspicion situation.

We are not

dealing with the Terry v. Ohio situation or Adams v. Williams
situation where there was a stop and a protective frisk for the
officer involved,which is certainly an eminently reasonable
type of situation.
With the Court's permission, I would like to reserve
time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Cleary.

Mr. Lacovara.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before the Court presents some very important
Fourth Amendment issues as counsel for the Petitioner has just
brought out, but as some of the questions from the ?„ench indicate
there are important practical issues at stake here too.

18
And 1 think it is important for the Court to keep both
sets, theoretical and practical, of these issues carefully in
mind in tending to the arguments and in resolving the dispute
between the parties.
First of all, it is important, I think, to give a
little background on what the facts of this particular case are.
The case — the search and seizure issue — arose
originally on stipulated facts, on a motion to suppress, and it
was stipulated that two border patroL agents, members of the
uniformed service of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
with the responsibility for controlling illegal entry of aliens
into the United States, were conducting a roving patrol on a
State highway, Highway 78 in the southeastern part of California.
In order to clarify the stipulated facts and to give
«

the Court some further sense of the topography, we have included
in our brief a map of the area involved to Indicate the inter**
relationship of the points involved.
And if I may respectfully direct the Court*s attention
to the map which we had the Army Map Service prepare, rather
quickly, I confess, so that it would be compact and yet would
focus on the important areas in question.
Q

This is for illustrative purposes, I take it,

Mr. Lacovara.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

I would suggest that, if necessary, this would be a

19
subject of judicial notices since these are indisputable
geographical features.
But we are just trying to clarify what the stipulated
facts are.

The stipulation was that Highway 7b on which this

stop took place just south of Glamis, California, is about the
only north-south highway in Southern California leading away
from the Mexican border that does not have an established
checkpoint on it, and for that reason it is frequently patrolled
by the Border Patrol.
Well, Highway 78, of course, as an even numbered
highway, generally runs east and west, and we have included
this map to show that the portion of the highway involved here
where it runs near the Mexican border, although it never touches
the border, runs generally northeasterly.
Q

Doesn't California number the highway?

It is not a

U.S. number, is it?
MR. LACQVARA:

Yes, sir, but I believe the California

system is the same as the general Federal system.
In any event, down in the lower left-hand corner, the
case begins, according to the stipulated facts.

That's the

border crossing point at Calexico, California, the sister city
of Mexicali, Mexico, the point from which petitioner conceded he,
at least, began his journey.

He said that he picked up the

automobile that was stopped and searched across the border in
Calexico.

He said he was drlv*ng up to Blythe, California, which

20
is in the extreme right -- top right-hand corner of the map;
the little yellow area is the town of Blythe.
The only road that leads through this approximately
120 mile drive, across mountains and generally desolate desert,
is Highway 78, and, as the Court can see, Glarnis is circled
almost on the center of the map.

Although it is shown as a town,

the Atlas — this is not in the record but, I believe, also
might be a subject of official notice -- the official Atlas
lists the population of Glamis at somewhere between 10 and 100
people.

►
But, the point that I am trying to suggest is that

this is a desolate area.

This was conceded at the trial.

At

the trial on the merits, the border patrol agents testified,as
did petitioner, and it was brought out that this was desert
country, the highway is partially unpaved and the stop took piece
sometime after midnight —
Q

And where on the road was it, west of Glamis?
MR. LACOVARA:

Just south.

— as I interpret the record

So that would be right

that would be just before he

arrived at Glamis.
Q

More west than south on the map.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, but the testimony at the trial was

south and that would be consistent, Your Honor, with the idea
that he was driving generally from the border area north to
Blythe.

So, if you look at the map —

21
Q

So, from Calexico, you'd come up 99 up to Bradley Muni,

and there get on Highway 78 and start east and then head
northeast.
ME., IACOVAEA:

Yes, sir.

The additional facts in the case, apart from the fact
that this is a rather desolate area, according to the stipula­
tion, was that this is a road that is known by border patrol
agents to be used by alien smugglers.

It was so agreed, and

for that reason it is frequently subjected to roving patrols.
The volume of traffic on the road is such that it does not —
it is not practical to maintain a permanent checkpoint for
aliens trying to enter the interior.
In our brief, we have suggested — again, this is
outside the record — some statistics showing the actual
experience on this road and they are included in a footnote
in our brief.
The agents decided to stop this car acting pursuant
to the statutory power that Congress conferred in 1946,to stop
vehicles and to search them for aliens,

And 1 have to emphasise

that this is not a Customs search, and all the Courts of Appeals
that have reviewed this issue have distinguished searches for
contraband from searches for aliens, as has Congress.

So we

are talking about a distinction made not by the Attorney General,
but by Congress.
The statute enacted in 1946 authorized a search for

22

aliens within a reasonable distance of the border.

The

regulation promulgated in 1952, which is printed in our brief,
fixes 100 miles as the outside limit for a reasonable distance,
except as Mr. Justice Stewart and counsel agree were airport,
entries in the interior, for example.
Q

Could that be that it didn't take much looking to

find a person as it would to find a 3mall package?
MR. LACGVARA:

Weil, we suggested, Mr. Justice, that

that's one of the reasons why when you get to the reasonableness
balance, the extent of the intrusion that's involved here is
much less than It would be if Congress had done the same thing
with contraband.
Q

I mean once you look in a car and you don't see any

other person, should you then turn it loose?
MR. LACOVARA:
must do.

That's what the border patrol agents

All they can do, under their statutory power, is to

examine the car for aliens.
And vie have cited the statistics in discussing the
searches at checkpoints to 3how that approximately 40% —
excuse me, two million, 20% of the 10 million cars that pass
through checkpoints are stopped for interrogation, that is,
a request to the driver and the passengers as to whether they
are aliens or American nationals.
Only about 20% of the number of cars stopped at
checkpoints, about 400,000, is subjected to any search or

23
inspection, and that is only the trunk area.
Q

When he stops you, does he say, "l am searching for

an alien, or I am searching for dope'1?

MR.

LACOVARA:

Frequently, he doesn’t explain the

object of his search.
Q

He just says, "I am searching."
MR. LACOVARA:

That’s right.

If he goes beyond

looking into areas where aliens, as a practical matter, can be
hidden, and have been hidden.

We’ve cited cases, hot just

speculation, but cases in which aliens have been found hiding
under the hoods of cars.

We’ve cited cases in which -- well,

in this case —
Q

Was it air conditioned?
MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Justice, one of the reasons why

the border patrol tries to do this is because the conditions
under which aliens are smuggled into the country are beastal.
Some of them are smothered in some of the vehicles that they
are packed into.
Q

Isn’t it true that one of the Mexicans, a very small

sized person, under the hood, was almost dead when they opened
the hood and let him out?

MR. LACOVARA:

This happens.

There was a recent

seizure of a fuel oil truck that was two-thirds loaded with
fuel oil and a central compartment had been made and there were
22 Mexican aliens crammed in there and they were standing knee-

MR. LACOVARA:

We also have stipulated facts here.

The agreement, and it was later testified to at trial by the
border patrol agents, that they had been advised by intelligence
bulletins from the border patrol that this particular kind of
smuggling technique was being used, that is the rear seats
springs of the car were being removed and aliens, perhaps two
aliens, could sit between the seat frame and the cushion.
Now, it is not in the stipulated facts, but it was
testified to at trial before the suppression motion was renewed
and again denied, that when the agents stopped this car they
looked in the trunk first, and it was only, if I may

25
AFTERNOON SESSION

(1:00 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lacavara, you may

continue.
MR. LACOVARA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I was in the process of describing what actually
occurred in this case, and had reached the point of describing
the stop of the vehicle that petitioner was driving, a car
which he said did not belong to him and which he was simply
driving up to Blythe, California, to drop off, as a favor to
some man he had met in a bar in Mexicali, Mexico.
But the agents, as is customary in inspecting
vehicles for aliens, looked first in the trunk of the automobile,
which would, of course, be the natural place where aliens are
discovered.
Officer Shaw, of the Border Patrol, testified at the
trial that when he looked in the trunk he did not see any aliens
or any other items, but saw that the plate over the back springs
of the car which, of course, was visible from the trunk area,
the dividing material between the rear seat and the trunk, was
unusual, it was not the standard kind of backing.

He said it

looked to him like cardboard or some other kind of light board,
and he thought that that might indicate that this rear seat had
actually been altered, and relying, he testified, on the
intelligence bulletins from the Border Patrol, he entered th&

26
cabin of the automobile, removed the rear seat cushion and
discovered marijuana.
The petitioner was then placed under arrest and a
further search of the car turned up 73 kilobricks of marijuana,
161 pounds.
The Government’s position in this case on the legal
questions, is that under several decisions of this Court,searches
can be conducted as reasonable within meaning of the Fourth
Amendment, even though there may not be probable cause to
suspect that the object of the search is involved in illegal
activity and even if there is no warrant specifically approving
that search in advance.
We have relied on several interrelated series of
decisions in our brief.

We start with the proposition that the

basic test under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, that
generally under the Warrant Clause this implies the two quali»
fications must be met in order for a search to be reasonable,
that is, that there must be probable cause for the search and
that probable cause must be adjudicated in advance by a magistrate
issuing a warrant.
This Court has held in numbers of cases that neither
of those requirements is absolute.

We rely primarily on the

administrative inspection line of decisions, Camara v. the
Saa Francisco Municipal Court and See v. the City of Seattle,
in which this Court specifically upheld the reasonableness of an

27

area inspection program, requiring access to private homes
as well as to private businesses, even without any reason to
suspect, much less any probable cause to believe, that a viola­
tion was taking place within the particular home or business.
Q

The Court in those cases did require that a, quote,

warrant, unquote, be secured.
MR, IACOVAM:

Yes.

With the explicit caveat,

Mr. Justice Stewart, that the warrant was being required in
accordance with the general presumption that warrants are
necessary, unless there are exigent circumstances excusing it.
Mr. Justice White's opinion for the Court in that
case pointed out that the object of the traditional inspection
under a building or fire code is to detect a rather fixed
violation which can't be quickly remedied in a structure which,
of course, is not moveable.
The opinion specifically leaves open the conduct of
such area inspections even without warrant if they are reasonable
under those circumstances, and that exception was taken in the
other line of cases that we relied on, Colonnade Catering
Corporation and Biswell* in which the Court specifically held
that without even suspicion and without a warrant an administra­
tive inspection to enforce regulatory law was valid.
Q

X submit that the difference between Colonnade and

this case is that there is nothing in this record to show that
this man is in the business of hauling illegal aliens.

28

MR. LAGOVARA:
true,

That’s right, and in -- that’s clearly

We liave conceded that these are not licensed activities

that vie are talking about.

But, by the same token, people

who own apartments, as Mr. Camara did in Camara v. Municipal
Court, are not in the business of living in apartments, but the
Court, Mr. Justice, specifically left open the possibility that
going through the balancing test, which is at the core of the
reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment, that it might
be reasonable to insist on inspecting his apartment, even though
lie is not licensed, without a warrant.
Q

Yes, but we suspect that this man had an alien.
MR. LAGOVARA:

Mo, it was conceded at trial that there

was no particular reason to suspect that this car was carrying an
alien,

Would they stop ray car if I was driving through there?
MR. LAGOVARA:

In that area?

Yes, sir.

What we are saying is the focus here as in —

Could you stop the President's car?

Well, if the car were marked as the

If it wasn't, you could stop it?
MR. LAGOVARA:

Yes, sir.

MR. LAGOVARA:

The position that we are taking is

that the object — the reasonableness inquiry in this case is the

reasonableness of the stopping of a car under all of the
circumstances.

Those circumstances include the sise of the

Is it on a highway which

Has the car already been stopped?

Is it an area that is known to be used by alien smugglers?

Is

it fairly close to the border?
Q

You mean some circumstances could be held to be un­

reasonable within 100 miles?
MR* LACOVARA:
I wanted to emphasise.

Yes, sir.

That’s the other thing that

He have explicitly disclaimed in our

brief any contention that the mere fact that the search takes
place within 100 miles of the border —
Q

So the regulation, on its face, may not be valid in

all circumstances?
MR. LACOVARA:

Hell, X would say it is valid on its

face because it talks about reasonable distances, and that’s
a constitutional standard.

But then it is defined.
MR. LACOVARA:

MR. LACOVARA:
Q

Yes.

And how far is San Antonio from the border?
MR. LACOVARA:

I can’t say exactly.

30
Q

Is part of the circumstance that would make a search

within 100 miles of the border reasonable as compared with
some unreasonable 100-mile searches would be whether there was
some reason to suspect or probable cause to believe that the
car had just come from the border?
MR. LACOVARA:

Ho, sir.

Again* this was discussed

in the colloquoy with — between —
Q

Yes, I know, but again you say there is no necessity

for that.
MR. LACQVARA:

Ho.

Because as we have tried to

detail in our brief, and as reported decisions that we‘ve cited
make clear, the common alien smuggling technique is not for
the car to pass the border, but for the aliens, unlike contra­
band — and this is one of the practical distinctions — unlike
contraband, which has to be moved by somebody, the aliens can
walk across this almost 2,000-mile border —even where the
Rio Grande is it is frequently fordable —

and meet someone

with whom they have advance arrangements a mile or so inside the
American border and be transported into the interior.
That's one of the reasons why, as a practical matter,
it is not feasible to accept counsel's suggestions to undertake
all of these searches on the physical border itself.
I might say —
Q

The best thing that could be done would be transporting.

He wasn't importing an alien

31
MR, LACOVARA:

That's right, the same statute, Section

13“24 of Title 8, makes it an offense to smuggle into the United
States or transport within the United States an illegal entrant
who has not submitted himself to *nsnecfcion at a port of entry.
So it is the same violation.
I would like to say that the statistics that are
officially published bear this out.

In fiscal year 1972, the

Immigration Service discovered 505,000 deportable aliens in
the United States.

Three hundred and ninety-eight thousand of

these, Mr. Justice, had not entered through legitimate ports of
entry, that is, they had crossed the border at places where
border patrol, border checkpoints are not established.

And

about -- virtually all of these — 393,000 were Mexican aliens
who had come across the border other than at the approved
checkpoints.
Q

That's not a legitimate point of entry.

criminal offense in and of itself?

Is that a

If I were in Mexico and

walked across the border back to the United States at a point
where there was no checkpoint, would I be guilty of a criminal
offense ?
MR. LACOVARA:

It applies to aliens.

It applies to

any alien who enters the United States other than at a point
designated and without inspection commits a misdemeanor.
Q

But not everybody who enters the United States,
MR. LACOVARA:

No, sir.

If you are a citizen —

32
Q

You can walk across anywhere*
Mi. LACOVARA:

Q

Yes*

Going into the circumstances that Justice White was

probing at, isn’t one of the circumstances that you rely on
the fact that this is identified as an habitual smuggling route
and road?
MR. LACOVASA:

Yes, sir.

That we say is one of the

important ingredients that District Court —
Q

An area in which you have enormous difficulty making

checks.
MR. LACOVASA:

The border is 2,000 miles long.

are only 1,400 men stationed there.

There

Even if we had the United

States Army stationed there, which X suggest would be a much
more difficult program to adopt for a variety of reasons than
the one that is adopted, it is physically impossible to line
every foot of the border to keep people from walking across,
and the statistics bear this out.

Three hundred and ninety»

eight thousand people out of the 505,000 deportable aliens found
in the country had crossed at other than the approximately two
dozen legitimate ports of entry along the Mexican border.
I should also say in response to the question dealing
with the possible criminal aspect of this that we submit that
there is justification for relying on this statute as an admin™
istrative enforcement mechanism rather than as a criminal
enforcement technique.

33
The basic object of the Immigration laws, of course,
is not to put people in jail.
violations.

These are not malum in se

This is part of a Congressional program of

regulating entry into the United States and into the interior.
The statistics on prosecution confirm this.

As I

mentioned, 398,000 people were located in the last fiscal year
who have technically violated the misdemeanor statute that I
referred to, Section 1325, yet only about 10,000 of them, 2%%,
were subjected to any prosecution at all.
Even on the alien smuggling or alien transportation
side, Mr. Justice Marshall, statistics show somewhat similar
results.

About 5800 transporters or smugglers were arrested.

The felony prosecution was authorised in only about 10% of those
and a misdemeanor prosecution for aiding and abetting -Q

Could you have stopped and searched this car for dope?
MR. LACOVARA: No, sir, not without probable cause.

We have consistently taken that position.
*

Q

But you could stop and search it for an alien.
MEL. LACOVARA:

If, under all the circumstances, it is

a reasonable exercise —
Q

And take out the back seat, where he couldn't be

laying under the back seat, and find dope.
MEL. LACOVARA:

Well, what happened in this case was

searching for aliens —
Q

He saw something that he suspected so then he took the

34

car apart.
Ml. LACOVARA:

Well, he didn’t take it apart.

He

removed the rear seat cushion knowing that there had, in fact,
been aliens discovered in the past under the rear seat and as
soon as he looked in the trunk he saw that there was something
different about this rear seat.
Q

But he couldn't have done it for dope?
MR. LACOVAM:

Not without probable cause.

Whether

he had probable cause after he looked in the trunk for aliens

Q

After I drive down the road, as the original question

I asked you, how do I know what you are searching for? I don’t.
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, I am not sure that that’s a

necessary factor under the Fourth Amendment.
Q

You are stopping me and I have a right to travel on

that public road and mind my own business and not be stopped.
You have a right to stop me and you can use the pretext if you
so desire to look for an alien and look for anything you want to
look for while you are at it.
MR. LACOVARA:
Q

No, sir.

I understand the only thing you said you can't look

in the paper bag for an alien but you can look in anything else.
MR. LACOVARA:

There have been three or four or five

reported decisions that I have seen over the last 20 years in
which Courts of Appeals have said, although you legitimately

35
stopped this ear for aliens and legitimately looked in the trunk
for aliens, when you saw something that couldn't contain an
alien, since vie find you didn't have probable cause to look for
contraband, you violated the Fourth Amendment by looking in that
jacket or paper bag or small trunk.
So that the courts have applied the distinction that
Congress has drawn. Congress has not purported to authorise
searches for contraband inside the border on less than probable
cause.
Q

Do you have any figures, you've been giving these

sort of figures, do you have any figures about how many aliens
have been discovered in searches like this?
MR, LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

We've — out of 398,000 who

entered the country without inspection, which means at other
than a border crossing point, in one fiscal year, 1972, 39,000
were discovered — 39,000 illegal aliens were discovered in
traffic checks.
Q

Within 100 miles of the border?
MR. LACOVARA:

Q

Yes.

Does that include those that were discovered at the

border ?
MR. LACOVARA:

Mo, this is in the traffic checking

operation which is inside —
Q

These are spot checks within the 100 miles?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, there are three types.

The type

36
that's involved in this case is the least frequently used.
Q

That's what I want to know, about this kind of cheek.
MR. LACQVARA:

from locale to locale.

Well, it varies from station to station.,
In corae regions up to one-half of the

aliens who are discovered in one of the three kinds of traffic
checking operations are detected in the roving patrol type.
In other locales —
Q

Would it make any difference to you if — or to the

Government in terms of reasonableness, if they only discovered
one alien out of every million stops?
MR. LACQVARA:

That, of course, is a circumstance

that has to be taken into account in appraising what this
Court in Camara and See appraised, the general reasonableness
of the administrative program.

Once you start changing the

factors being weighed in the scale —
Q

This is a spot checking operation without that —

based on the assumption that every now and then we are going
to find an alien, and your claim is that we are going to find
them often enough to justify stopping anybody you want to, within
that area?
MR. LACQVARA:

Yes, sir.

In our brief, I mentioned

at the outset of my argument, this was not In the record because
— it ia not in the record, but we have made the representation
that on this road in one fiscal year that 192 aliens were
actually discovered as part of the roving patrol, because there

37

is no fixed or temporary traffic «i*
Q

But you don’t knot» how many out of the 39,000 -<•

I suppose every officer turns in a report on every stop he
makes.
MR. IAC0VAM:

1 believe that’s true, but I am not

sure.
Q

So you don’t know how many stops were made?
MR. LACOVARA;

I can't give you that statistic.

X

can say —
Q

How much dope was found in the same area?
MR. LACOVARA:

He have that statistic in there.

At

the same time that 192 aliens were discovered, there were five
drug seizures.
Q

Along with the aliens or separate?
MR. LACOVARA:

‘Hie statistics that I have don't show

whether they were joint or in addition, but I would suggest that
that indicates that our experience bears out that the real
thrust of this is looking for aliens, rather than — and as X
say, the recorded decisions do not indicate that there has been
any abuse of this power.
All of the Courts of Appeals that are concerned with
this, the Fifth, the Tenth and in the Ninth, have all specifically
upheld this statute and this regulation as a reasonable exercise
of Congressional authority under the Fourth Amendment and of
administrative interpretation, using the case by case method to

38

analyse each particular search under it.
Q

Mas there any checkpoint on this road? I have forgotten,
MR. LACOVAM:

Q

Mo, sir.

That ms stipulated.

So this is, the only kind of a stop on this road is

the kind of a stop that was made in this case?
MR. LACOVAFA:
Q

Yes, sir.

So all 192 were seized under —
MR. IACQVARA:

Under roving patrols on this road.

And if this kind of inspection program is held unconstitutional,
then I must point out that a similar rationale would presumably
apply to the checkpoint,
Q

The checkpoint is no better within the 100 miles.
MR. LACOVARA:

Unless you wanted to say, as in the

Falmore case, I might point out, pending before this Court,
and also the D.C. Court Reorganization Act, the validity of a
spotcheck of an automobile for license and registration under
the Fourth Amendment, is before the Court.

Counsel in that

case is arguing that a universal check at a roadblock would be
all right but selectively stopping people would not be.
Conceivably, that could be a distinction between roving patrols
and fixed checkpoints.
Q

You wouldn’t make that distinction, would you?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, if the Court invalidated the

roving checkpoints, I’d be back here next term making that
distinction, I. suspect.

39
Q
methods.

Mr.

Lacovara, you said there were three different

Mi. LACOVARA:

checkpoints.
Q

And the other two involve established

One is a permanent checkpoint.

At the border,
MR, LACOVARA:

Wo, sir.

These are all inside the

border, under the authority of this statute, to stop in the
interior within a reasonable distance of the, border.
Q

So one Is a roving patrol, the other is an established

checkpoint **«*
MR. LACOVARA:
capital structure*

A permanent checkpoint.

That*s a large

It is built right across the highway, and

it has —
Q

Why would it be there rather than at the border?
MR. LACOVARA:

I argued that in our brief, because

so many people cross at other than the two doaen or so approved
ports of entry, that what these permanent checkpoints established
at a confluence of roads.

And they are also away from the

border because there is a lot of ordinary border crossing
traffic that goes on legitimately and it would be disproportion»
ately Interfering with that kind of legitimate traffic to do
all of this kind of inspection at the border.

So by the time

you get to the permanent or temporary checkpoints within the
interior, that local traffic has been filtered out.

There are

about 13 permanent checkpoints, all but one more than 25 miles

40
from the border and all less, of course, than
Q

The other one is a temporary checkpoint.
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, no, there are 13 permanent

checkpoints, 12 of them arc more than 25 miles from the border,
one is closer, the one at Laredo is closer.

And temporary

checkpoints can be established from time to time in order to
avoid alien smugglers using roads that bypass the established
checkpoints.
You set it up for a temporary period of time.

During

the time it is set up, do you check every single vehicle going
through there?
MR. LACOVARA:

It is the same procedure that’s

followed at a permanent checkpoint.
in our brief.

We’ve given these statistics

Approximately 10 million cars passed through

temporary and permanent checkpoints in the last fiscal year.
Q

At both borders?
MR. LACOVARA:

There are measures like this only

on the Mexican border because 95% of the immigration problem
is at the Mexican border.
The statistics that the Immigration Service has
provided indicate that about 10 million cars passed through
one or two of these types of checkpoints on -- near the Mexican
border.. About 2 million, 20%, were stopped only for questioning,
"Are you an American citizen?"

Of the number stopped, only

about another 20%, or 400,000, were subjected to any inspection,

41
that’s looking in the trunk, and only about 2,000, excuse me,

2% of those inspected, or about 8,000 cars over the fiscal year
out of 10 million were subjected to searches under the hoods or
under the rear seats.
Q

Has the provision in the statute with respect to

searching the real property been litigated?
MR. LACOVARA:
Q

And how old is this statute?
MR. LACOVARA:

Q

Ho, sir, not that I have ever seen.

That provision was added in 1952.

And the regulation?
MR. LACOVARA:

The regulation was added in 1952,

The

statute that's before the Court on the search vehicles within
100 miles was enacted in 1946.
Q

And I take it there is a flexibility among the various

districts as to whether to have it 100 or 25 or 5?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, it's flexibility following the

factors that are set up in the regulations, considering topography,
confluence of arteries, inconvenience to the traveling public,
population density and reliable information.
The local district director decides generally where
to set these up, but in the case of the permanent checkpoints —
Q

What's the local district director's determination in

this one?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, in this case, there is no local

district determination because this was a roving patrol rather

42
than a fixed checkpoint.
Q

I gather with the roving patrol there is no determina­

tion whether it ought to be within a 10 mile area, a 20 mile
area or 25 taile area?
MR, LACOVARA:

There is not any explicit determination.

That is left generally to administrative supervision.

In imple­

menting the statute, I would submit that this is like the
executive field level discretion that has to be exercised under
an arrest statute.

The officer has to make his judgment on the

spot, subject to some balance -Q

If you told us before, Mr. Lacovara, I did not take

note of it, what checkpoints are in the range of this mantle
of yours, any at all?
MR. LACOVARA:

None, sir.

Not that I know of.

There is a checkpoint on Highway 76 to the west of
Brawley.

That would be off to the left of the map, about 40

miles or more from where this took place.

But the stipulated

evidence -- and this accords with what I understand the actual
experience to be -- is that in that 40 mile, or so, slice of the
border, or more, that is represented by this map, there is no
permanent or temporary border patrol checkpoint.

Highway 78,

as you will see from the map, is about the> only road that cuts
across this desert.

That's the orie that goes northeast from the circled

MR. LAC0VARA:

Yes, sir.

Highway 78 runs through

It is also called U.S. Highway 99 when it's going

through the City of Brawley, but it cuts through Glamis, the
town of Glamis.
Q

Isn't there a point at Calexico?
MR. LACOVARA:

a port of entry.

That’s a regular border station, that’s

We are talking in this case about alien

checkpoints not at the border.

Calexico is one of five ports

of entry in Southern California.

But the statistics that I

suggest to the Court show that 398,000 people, 393,000 of them
Mexican aliens, entered at other than one of these border
ports of entry.
Q

I understood you to say the map did not include any

permanent or temporary checkpoint.
MR. LACOVARA:

Well it doesn't in the sense that we

are talking about permanent and temporary checkpoints as check­
points beyond the border of the United States established under
this statutory authority.

It is conceded by both sides that

a point on the border -- if someone had crossed at the border
and presented himself for inspection as other statutes required,
there could have been a routine inspection and thorough —
including search of the person -- without probable cause or
without a warrant.
But we are talking here about power of Congress to
establish a mechanism for enforcement of the alien smuggling and

illegal entry controls £hat authorizes some inspections inside
i

the border*

And these are the permanent and temporary check­

points and roving patrols that we are talking about that are
implemented under the statute and regulation.

Thank, you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CLEARY, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cleary, we know, of

course that a border line is simply a hypothetical line or thin
line made by a map maker with a pen.

Would it

is there a

constitutional barrier, do you think, for Congress to set up
a sanitary zone, as it were, and say that the border is going
to be three miles or five miles wide, from the identifiable
international boundary, three miles, five miles back.

This is

boundary, border, as far as the United States Immigration and
Customs Services are concerned.
Would that have constitutional problems?
MR. CLEARY:
problems.

I think it would have constitutional

However, it would be a much better posture than what

we have here.
Specifically, I think, what Your Honor might be touching
upon, which has troubled me greatly about this particular case,
is unlike Colonnade and Biswell* where there was detailed
statutory scheme set up where Congress outlined the procedure*
Here the statute says reasonable distance, and then the Executive,
through the INS takes over with regulations and, you know, if
they set up this sanitized sone I would say seriously, now, there

45
might be a case where Congress could create this sanitised
area with certain limitations as to the nature of the intrusion
that would be conducted, limiting also the operation of these
various checkpoints.
The ironic thing about this case is that the checkpoints are little borders, so to speak.

If you are stopped on

Interstate 5,going towards L.A., at the border, what we call
the first stop is just initial check and if you look funny or
suspicious or anything out of the ordinary you are kicked over
to what they call secondary, and there they can literally take
your car apart, and you have little to say at the border.
The question and the ironic thing is when you are
stopped at the checkpoints the INS uses the same tern, over
to secondary with the same limitation.

They have created the

second border exception.
Now, sny only reaction is that it kind of strikes at
what the Fourth Amendment is designed to do for the Executive
to do that, but I think that Congress as the law maker could
sit down and work out certain things.
I think also metropolitan areas would be in a different
posture.
Q

Well, I was just going to come to that,

I suppose

at least one of the considerations that moved Congress to give
rule-making power, in a sense, to the Service, was that they
wanted to have flexibility for the boundary near San Antonio,

46
Texas, or any other densely populated area, and broader rule
for this big open space that we’ve got on this map.

Is that

reasonable ?
MR. CLEARY:

Well, I think that’s possibly giving to

Congress a little too much credit because the analysis of
legislative history is very sparse on this particular statute.
'v

Further, I think this was a response to an exhortation
of the Government to include this amendment about reasonable
distance.

And I feel that the matter was not properly dealt

with by Congress in the present posture of this case in that,
given the areas though, even open or desolate areas, as they
might be called, the person in those areas is no less of a
person under our system of Government than, say, someone else.
So that the camper in that area who is a transient or the
resident in that area, really, because he is so fortuitously
located near the border, should not subject him to some type of
police surveillance to which it is our contention the Fourth
Amendment would prohibit.
In the posture of this case,

I

would also suggest that

like the Carroll decision, where they were looking for alcohol,
and not an administrative regulation just eliminating alcohol,
here they are looking for aliens.

And the alien, himself, one

alien, no matter how big or how small, is in violation of the
statute, his presence in the country in violation of 1325, as
counsel has pointed out.

The person carrying him is in violation

47
of 1324, a felony dealing with either transporting or the
bringing in unlawfully of aliens.

And further, that a man who

comes back a second time after having been deported, is not just
a person we are going to slap on the wrist but who is subject to
a felony prosecution under 8 USC 1326.

This is criminal

business.
Further, the other difficulty is, in this particular
matter, the scope of the search.
Now, counsel has said that there are few cases
litigated about how far the Immigration Service goes.
there are quite a few.

I think

And not only that, at the District

Court level, we had a case where the agent, with his unique
olfactory senses discovered what he thought was marijuana by
sniffing hard in the vehicleT

He sniffed so hard that he

opened up the suitcase and there it was, narcotics.
court.

He went to

The only trouble was when the motion to suppress was

granted it was cocaine in the suitcase rather than marijuana.
Another situation turned upon how fas? they go in
locating aliens.

There were two suitcases together, neither one

of which would hold an alien,and they searched both trunks, and
the Court said well that's not a very good thing.
go all the way to the Ninth Circuit.

It had to

You should have pushed the

cases apart before you started to look for an alien because
that's all that was physically possible.
And I think that there is a certain amount of

n

48
gymnastics that go on to allow legitimate law enforcement
inquiry.

But I think.in this area if there is a reasonable

oar as to contrabands a far more serious and more harmful thing
to our national interest then that bar should stand also as
to aliens.
Q

Bo you think if Congress had the power to create

some kind of a sanitary zone or cordon, they could require
everyone in that area, day or night, 24 hours a day, to have a
pass?
Ml. CLEARY:

Well, Your Honor, 1 can't speak as to

the law, but speaking as an American citizen I think that
smacks of something that is just so gross with our way of life
that I could never understand Congress doing something like that,
Q

You don't have that same objection about a passport

to leave or enter the country?
MR. CLEARY:

Ho, sir, I don't, but that's at the

border and that's if I leave this country but here in this
country if I carry something like that, I'd have to start
checking out my arm for some type of tatoo.

It smacks of a

form of government that is so foreign to ours that I doubt
whether something like that would ever be adopted by Congress,
Q

What specific provision of the Constitution

would

you think would be the barrier to that?
MR. CLEARY:

I am at a loss to respond to Your Honor,

Mr. Chief Justice, I couldn't say.

It is just —

49
Q

It is not in this case, so we won't

not directly

involved - so I don't hold you to it, but would you think
there is a Fourth Amendment problem there, if people were
required to carry and show their passes, that this would be
unreasonable?
MR. CLEARY:

I think so.

I think also Fifth

Amendment, going back to the Shapiro case, Shapiro v. Thompson,
and all the other ones on the freedom of movement concept.
There is clearly law, and I fully agree with the
right of aliens carrying identification cards, the X~151, that's
I think legitimate, clearly legitimate.

But for an American

citizen to carry identification in that type of area, there
might be also an Equal Protection argument, that a person
who is inside, not in the sanitized zone, why would he not have
to carry such an identification.
It is frought with problems that are not here before
you in this particular case.

I think there Is much ingenuity

that could be worked out by Congress that was not handled in
this particular case and I think that is one of the troublesome
aspects.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Cleary.

vise, Cleary, you appeared here by appointment to the

Court after your colleague unfortunately became incapacitated,
and, on behalf of the Court, I want to thank you for your
assistance to us and, of course, your assistance to your client.

50
ME.. CLEARY:

Thank you so much, Mr, Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 1:35 o’clock, p.m., the oral argument
in the above-entitled case was concluded.)
