PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

VJe will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 71-16375 the City of Burbank and
others against Lockheed Air Terminal and others.
Mr. Sieg, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. SIEG, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SIEG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please the

Court:
The subject of this case is an airport, a privatelyowned and operated airport in a thiclcly-populated area almost
entirely within the City of Burbank.

The problem with respect

to this airport began in approximately 1965, when jet aircraft
began using this airport on a regular basis.

As jet traffic

increased, the problem became more serious.
The problem was first officially noted by the FAA
tower chief at this airport in 1967 when he issued the first of
a series of four runway abatement preferences.

He noted at

the time that the problem in the vicinity of airports had
become increasingly serious and that if the problem could not
be resolved, it might be necessary to olo3e runways and even
entire airports.
After this, he issued three other and different
runway preference orders.
stantial relief.

None of these provided any sub­

The last of these orders was issued in

September of 1969»
Thereafter, the Council of the City of Burbank took
the matter in hand, and in March of 1970, adopted the ordinance
which is before the court.
The ordinance makes it unlawful for the operator of
the Hollywood-Burbank Airport to allow a pure jet aircraft
to take off between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.,
except in emergencies.

The same prohibition is applied to

the pilots of these aircraft.
As noted by the Court of Appeals in its decision,
the express purpose of the ordinance was to abate the serious
environmental problems caused by the taking off of jet aircraft
during sleeping hours.

As found by the Trial Court, the

ordinance interfered with one Sunday night intra-state flight
and with flights of jet aircraft of at least three per week.
Some of those who have filed briefs in this case
had mistakenly used the figure of 60 per month as the number of
corporate jet flights interfered with by the ordinance.

This

number 60 is the total number of jet — corporate jet aircraft
flights during night-time hours, as testified to by the Presi­
dent of Lockheed.

He was unable to state how many of these

flights occurred during the proscribed hours.
Q

Well, it would be a little difficult to predict

the pattern of private aircraft, would it not?
MR. SI3G:

Yes, your Honor, it would.

I assume it

r—

was irregular, but the plaintiffs in this case did not go
into that in any detail.
Q

When you say "night take-offs," you mean

sunset to sunrise?
MR. SIEG:

Yes, the testimony as found in the

record refers to the fact that since the aircraft, corporate
jet aircraft, took off during the night-time hours, and that
word was specifically used and I followed that answer with a
questions as to how many of these occurred during the
proscribed hour and the President of Lockheed was unable to
state how many.

He first said, "Maybe half," and then he

had to state that he couldn’t testify to that fact.
May I continue, your Honor?
The evidence in this case established that airports,
whether publicly or privately owned, had not been brought
into the orbit of federal control with one exception.

The

exception is found in section 612 of the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958, which was adopted in 1970 and became effective
after the trial of this case on May 27, 1972.
That section is very peculiarly worded.

It provides

that any person who desires to serve aircarriers — the word
"desires" is

used in the section — aircarriers certificated

by the Civil Aeronautics Board may apply for an airport
operating certificate.

The section further provides that the

Federal Aviation Administrator must issue such a certificate

6
if he finds that the person is able to conduct a safe
operation, that is all.

The administrator may attach conditions

to these certificates that further this particular end, that is,
the safe operation.
Section 6ll of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
which played a prominent part in this case, was added in 1968.
It confers on the Federal Aviation Administrator the power to
issue such rules and regulations as he may find necessary to
provide for the control and abatement of aircraft noise and
sonic boom.

If this section conferred on the administrator

the power to regulate airports in terms of noise, he had
specifically refrained from so doing and, as repeatedly
affirmed, the freedom of aircraft proprietors to exclude
aircraft from their airports on the basis of noise considera­
tions .
The District Court, in its decision, held the
ordinance to be invalid on the ground of preemption, conflict
and the unreasonable burden which the ordinance would have
if it were applied to all major airports throughout the
United States.
The Court of Appeals, in its decision, did not
1

reach the commerce clause issue and restricted its decision to
the supremacy clause matters.

It held the ordinance to be

repugnant to the supremacy clause of the United States'
Constitution on the ground of preemption and also on the

7
ground of conflict and the conflict issue had cited the last
of the PAA tower chiefs noise abatement runway procedures
and also the fact that the ordinance interfered with the
Sunday night intrastate flight of PSA.
The Court of Appeals broadly held in ±t3 decision
that the pervasiveness of the federal regulation in the field
of air commerce, the national interest in such regulations
and the nature of air commerce itself precluded state and
local governments from enacting this type of regulation.
The District Court, in its deoislon holding that
the ordinance had to be viewed in the aspect as if it were
applied to all major airports in the United States, was a
holding along with the broad holding of the Court of Appeals
which made it necessary that we apply to this Court for
hearing.
The ordinance comes before this Court With the
presumption that it was reasonable and necessary.

The evidence

introduced by the plaintiffs in this case demonstrated the
airport's inadequacy.

The airport is simply not operable with­

out the use of adjacent private property for its approachways
and its takeoffs.

Both the District Court and the Court of

Appeals specifically noted the seriousness of the problem
that the airport created to those that resided in its vicinity.
This problem was further underscored by the various
statements made by the PAA tower chief in these various noise

8
abatement runway procedures.

He stated, for example, that the

area within five miles of the airport was noise sensitive.

He

made further reference to the numerous complaints, the possible
result of requiring the closing down of runways and entire
airports.
This brings me to the point that 1 would like to
elaborate on.

It is against the background that I just

stated that we have noted in our brief, that the commerce
clause cannot shield those who invade Fifth Amendment rights
and that legislation such as the Burbank ordinance must be
sustained if that amendment is to have any real meaning.
We pursue this especially in view of this court’s
recent decision in Rowe versus Wade.

By that decision, it is

now firmly established that a right of privacy exists, not­
withstanding the fact that there is no specific mention of
this right in the Constitution.
As we understand the court's opinion, this funda­
mental right is founded on the 14th Amendment concept of
personal liberty and restriction on state action.

If this be

so, then the same right of privacy must exist under the
Fifth Amendment as a restriction on the powers of the Federal
Go\'ernment.
This decision, along with Griswold versus
Connecticut, in our view, gives form and substance to the
belief of the signers of the Declaration of Independence that

9
certain unalienable rights existed* including the right to

J

life* liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Q

Mr. Sieg, that right of privacy that was

mentioned in those cases was a right as against governmental
action.

When an airplane takes off owned by a private carrier*

that is not the government invading anybody’s right of
privacy* is it?
MR. SIEG:

It is in this respect.

If the decision

of the court of appeals and the district court in this case,
is correct* in holding that the

Federal Government has

preempted the right of states and local governments and the
people from doing something about this invasion into their
right of privacy, then we feel that this particular decision
is most Important and is applicable as against the

Federal

Government.
Q

I still have a little difficulty in seeing

when an executive jet owned by a private company takes off,
how that is governmental action, because that is what is the —
it is the noise from that jet owned by the XYZ Corporation
that invades what you call the "right of privacy" and that
is not government invading the right of privacy, is it?
MR. SIEG:

I agree with that, your Honor.

What 1

am trying to get to is that a declaration of preemption,
whether it be by Congress or by the court, which leaves
unprotected fundamental rights of the people such as are

10

involved in this case —
Q

It is a freedom.

It Is a freemdom that

government cannot invade.
MR. SIEG:
Q

That Is correct.

But the invasion is by a private corporation.

MR. SIEG:

But the Invasion of a declaration of

preemption is by the governments.the Federal Government.
it leaves fundamental rights unprotected, it

If

is, in our view,

unpermissable.
Let me pursue it just a little further and maybe I
can more appropriately demonstrate what I am driving at.
Q

Are you saying that the government action is

the prohibition by the Federal Government of any effort on the
part of the local people to protect themselves.
MR. SIEG;
Q

That is correct.

That is the governmental action you are talking

about.
MR. SIEG:

That is the governmental action, your

Honor and I would submit to you, now I recognize that in
Rowe versus Wade, we have a certain right of privacy that is
not

exactly comparable to the right of privacy that we feel

is involved here.
involved In

What we say is, that the right of privacy

this case is based on the 3ame principle of

personal liberty and based on the same considerations.
Noise pollution, as we see it, whatever its form,

11
impinges on the right to be let alone and invades the right
of privacy.

It disturbs thought and contemplation.

It in­

trudes into the home, Interfering with family life, conversa­
tion and sleep.

It has other more drastic side effects such

as hearing loss and irritation which, if long continued, can
interfere with man’s ability to deal with other aspects of
his environment.
Q

Would that

also apply to the Federal Govern­

ment to clean up a navigable stream?
MR. SIEG:

I have indicated something along that

line in ray brief and I thought it best, since I had this
problem of presentation, that I restrict myself to noise
pollution because noise pollution does invade the right of
privacy.

I would believe until this court enunciates a

further unenumerated right existing in the Constitution, I
would have been going beyond the scope of my endeavor here to
have gotten into those areas.
Q

What about a noisy railroad train?

MR. SIEG:

If it produced the volume and the effects

of jet aircraft, yes, but I — there is no proper comparison
between the two.
Q

Well, they do have jet engines now.

MR. SIEG:
Q

I was not aware of that, your Honor.

Well, would your same rule apply to the jet

engines driving a locomotive?

12

MR. SIEG:
Q

If it ~

In Interstate commerce?

MR. SIEG:

If it produced the same kind of problem
*

that the .jet engine in an aircraft produces, yes, your Honor.
Q

V/e'd have to do a little business with quite a

few cases, wouldn’t we?
MR. SIEG:

Not if the rule that I hope to present

to the Court Is adopted by the Court.
I — I feel, as Mr. Chief Justice Burger indicated,
that this is in a declaration of premption — is impermissible
when it leaves unprotected fundamental rights, whatever they
may be.

If it is water pollution, air pollution, noise

pollution or whatever may

affect — substantially affect —

the health and safety of people.

But that, of course, is

going beyond what I intended to argue in this matter.
Q

Mr. Sieg, supposing that there were no issue of

federal preemption here at all, that Congress had said
nothing and there really weren't any argument that Congress
had preempted the matter.

Do you think that the citizens

around the Burbank Airport would have some sort of a
constitutional claim against these air carriers without any
governmental action at all?
MR. SIEG:

no, sir — I — no, sir.

If preemption

isn’t involved, obviously the ordinance is valid.

It is

valid anyway on the grounds that we have argued In our brief

13
that there is no federal premption, no conflict, but as we
view the matter, the rights reserved to the people can be
protected by any level of government.

It is not In the

exclusive power of the Federal Government to protect those
rights.

The people have many means.

The courts, of course,

are the primary right and the primary method, at least in this
century, of vindicating fundamental rights, especially civil
rights.
We are dealing in this case with human rights and
we need some rule that allows action by the people to whatever
»

governmental body will listen to them to protect these rights
reasonably.

We do not contend in this case that the funda­

mental right of privacy involved here is absolute.
that the right has to

We say

be viewed In terms of its effect and

there has to be a balancing.

That is, that the people are

entitled to all reasonable and necessary protection, not
absolute protection.
The balancing that we feel is proper is somewhat
along the lines suggested In Southern Pacific versus Arizona.
The extent of the intrusion should be weighed against the
effect on interstate commerce and if the enactment, the
ordinance or the state lav/ or whatever it may be, provides
substantial and necessary relief, it should have a greater
weight in the balancing.
I might add that the Court may recall — and again,

14
I am striking at this doctrine of preemption and conflict,
but the first two of the

grievances that are set forth in

the Declaration of Independence against the King of Great
Britain, were these two:

"He has refused his assent to laws,

the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has

forbidden his government to pass laws of Immediate and pressing
Importance unless suspended in their operation till his
assent should be obtained."
The similarity between these grievances and the
grievances that are set forth In the declarations of pre­
emption contained in the more recent Congressional enactments,
especially the Noise Control Act of 1972, are worthy of note.
We submit as a proposition worthy of this Court's
consideration that a Congressional declaration of preemption
cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative
authority where the net effect is to leave fundamental rights
to the people unprotected.
What we are really saying is the application here
of the dormant and unexercised power rule that is set forth in
Head and Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission even though
there is express or implied Congressional declaration of
preemption, the country has to have it.
When you observe that for more than ten years, some
7-odd million people of the United States have had to bear
the burden of air commerce with the only remedy afforded, If

15
you can call it a remedy, is the right to seek damages — the
right to seek damages if they own the property on which they
reside as against the airport proprietor,

This, to us, is

contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal
Constitution.
We equally feel that the time has come for the
courts to take a direct hand in this matter.

The Solicitor

General affirms, in his brief and I assume he will argue
accordingly, that states and local governments, whether they
are proprietors or nonproprietors, can enact reasonable
regulations to control the noise problem in connection with
airports within their jurisdiction.
But suppose the local governmental entity having
jurisdiction refuses or fails to give the residents in their
vicinity appropriate and necessary relief.

Only the courts

are then available.
It seems to us that the problem has escalated to
such a point that the lower federal courts should take a hand
in the matter and, if necessary, require from these airport
proprietors, the submission of plans which xirill eventually
reduce the problem of noise to levels which the people can
stand.
Q

Your argument is going way, way beyond the

issues in this case, isn't it?

What we need is a

That is what I am trying to say.

The Burbank

ordinance provides a solution for a very limited group of
circumstance.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Sieg.

Mr. Yost.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS C. YOST, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLANTS
MR. YOST:
Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I’ll first discuss the applicability of the National

Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement
Act and the Noise Control Act and then apply them to the facts
of this particular case.
Together, these establish a a national policy cf
preservation of the environment In general and of the reduction
of noise pollution in particular and this policy has been
relegated by the Appellees to the obscurity of a footnote on
page 67 of their brief.

It deserves more.

Their rationale is that given by the Ninth Circuit
that, given the generality of a national policy, it must yield
to the more specific activities of the federal regulatory
agency in the authorizing statute in the field of aviation
and that contention, quite simply, is wrong.

17
It was the purpose of Congress In enacting the
National Environmental Policy Act to, rather than pore through
the statutes, the codes, one by one and amend the authorizing
bill for each specific single-purpose board or commission,
to amend them all with one stroke and it did that with the
enactment of NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act and
in the words of Senator Jackson, the bill’s author on the
floor, in explaining the bill, this constitutes a statutory
enlargement of the responsibilities and concerns of all
Instrumentalities of the Federal Government.
What portions, then, of the National Environmental
Policy Act are applicable?

Section 101 declares the policy

but Congress wasn’t content with a mere declaration of policy
lest it be considered merely hortatory and something not to
be ahdered to.

It inserted three devices which Senator

Jackson on the floor in explaining the bill referred to as,
"action forcing."

Now, of these three, the ones with which

most people are most familiar, is of course, first the
Environmental Impact statement.

Secondly, the requirement

that there be consultations with experts and comment.

And,

third, is the one .which Senator Jackson put first and which
is the one which is most pertinent to this case.
As he explained It on the Senate floor, to insure
that the policies and goals defined In this act are infused
into the ongoing programs and actions of the Federal

18
Government, the Act aleo establishes some important actionforcing procedures.

Section 102 authorises anti directs all

federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to administer
their existing laws and regulations in conformance with the
policies set forth in this act and that essential wording,
then, appears in section 102 of the Act.
Three months later, Congress passed the Environmental
Quality Improvement Act and in that Act, it reiterated the
national policy and, secondly, it said that the primary
responsibility for implementing that national policy rested
with the state and local governments.
And, finally, we get to the Noise Control Act and
there are four sections of that that I want to talk about.
First, section 2-B.

Congress declared there was a policy of

preserving an environment for all Americans free from noise that
jeopardizes their health or welfare..
Next is section 4-A and that says that every federal
agency must adhere to the policy which I previously outlined
in section 2-B.

Now, the Appellees in their argument, again

in a footnote, say that this means only that the FAA must
balance environmental considerations with the considerations of
aviation which is, in a sense, a truism but it also reduces
the Act to nothing because that was a preexisting obligation,
at least since the enactment of NEPA.
The third section that I want to refer to is, I

19
think, the most important one, section 4-B, which says that
Federal agencies must comply with state and local noise
requirements for the control of noise to the same extent that
any person is subject to that requirement and the Appellees,
this time in half a footnote, dismiss that by saying that the
statement assumes the validity of the local ordinance.
Well, of course that is true.

But that misses the

entire point of what Congress was trying to do.

Congress has

made the local ordinance valid by enacting section 4-B.

Until

that time, any time state and local government tried to
regulate noise against the federal entity, somebody would
come in and say, "supremacy clause, you can't do that," and
Congress, by enacting 4-B, has reversed that and has said, it
is valid.

You can do that unless the specific measures

presecribed in section 4-B for the President to exempt a
particular activity are affirmatively undertaken by the
President.

Fine — yes?
Q

Mr. Yost, it is one thing to say that a local

ordinance can't regulate a. federal activity that isn't
otherwise covered by statute, just by virtue of the supremacy
clause, and it is another thing to say that a local ordinance
is negated by an affirmative federal statute which itself
occupies the field.
MR. YOST:
Justice Rehnquist.

I am not sure that I follow that,
In this particular case, were it not for

20
federal activity vilthin the area which — activity such as the
PAA purporting by its runway preference order to take action
which would invalidate a

local ordinance, if not for that,

the local ordinance would be valid and Congress is now stepping
in and saying the Federal Government has to obey the local
ordinance unless there is affirmative action by the President.

Q

As I understand the Appellee's contention,

though, it is not Just that the PAA order was preempted, but
that the

whole federal statutory scheme was preemptive and

the contrast I was trying to draw was between that type of an
argument and, say, an argument that the City of Burbank
couldn't regulate military takeoffs — takeoffs of military
planes quite apart from any federal statute Ju3t because that
is a federal activity.
MR. YOST:

I think those are both aspects to it.

One, perhaps, to which I was addressing myself was more the
conflict aspect and you have been addressing yourself more to
the aspect of preemption and it is my contention that pre­
emption may no longer be envisioned as it has in the past,
solely as a question of taking one statutory scheme that
pre-existed, the various environmental acts, and looking at
that alone.

It becomes a question of defining what you mean

by the field alleged to

be preempted.

I suppose the aviation purist will say,“well, it's
the field of aviation and you look at all the Federal

21
Government hae done in this area and you need unitary control
and so on "and the environmental purist will say., "Well, it’s
the field of noise, and this is a state and local matter and
you’ve got tc have one authority of unitary control over that
because if you control some noise sources but not other noise
sources, you haven’t gotten anywhere."
Weil, both of those really miss the point.

The point

of this case is that it is neither a pure aviation case nor a
pure noise case, but it is a case which involves the inter­
relationship of the two and here, I think, it is important
to get into just what has

happened in the field of the

regulation of aircraft noise.
Is there, to use the California Supreme Court’s
words in Loma Portal, what is described as a "lacuna" in the
federal regulatory scheme.

Let’s look at the possibilities

for regulation of aircraft and airport noise.

Look at land

use, siting, compatible zoning around an airport, the Federal
Government has done nothing.
You look at single event noise limits such as we
have heared the Port Authority in New Jersey and New York has
been applying since the 1950’s.

The Federal Government has

done nothing, though, of course, New York has.
You look at the cumulative mechanism for watching
the overall exposure to noise and reducing that, the system
which we are now experimenting with in California and section

22

783 of the Noise Control Act says that that Is one of the
matters that EPA is to study and to report back to in Congress
and. I know that they are watching the California experiment.
You look at time limitations such as Burbankimposed, Santa Monica-imposed.

Again, the Federal Government

has done nothing except at Washington National which It owns.
You look at mandating the use of quieter airplanes,
something which Los Angeles has proposed on which the Federal
Government has done nothing.
You look at runway preference orders.

There is an

area where the Federal Government has taken some steps , though
we learned from Port Authority against Eastern Airlines that
that is ultimately the responsibility of the proprietor
rather than the Federal Government and,

finally, noise

limitations on individual aircraft types, the so-called "type
certification" of the new aircraft and here the Federal
Government has done a little, but not very much, such that the
legislative history of the Noise Control Act shows a letter
from Senator Tunney to Senator Muskle to the effect that by
1975 18.6 percent of the aircraft will have been controlled
In that way.
In other words, In the field of the regulation
of aircraft and airport noise, taking both these fields to­
gether and meshing them, the Federal Government has just
barely stepped onto the edge of that field.

It i3 In the

23

light of that, that I think this matter must be viewed.
So what statutes, then, are the statutes which are
applicable to this field?

It is not, as would have been the

case five years ago, just the Federal Aviation Act.

It Is,

instead, the Federal Aviation Act, the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Environmental Qualtiy Improvement Act and the
Noise Control Act.
It is no longer enough just to view single-purpose
regulatory statutes by themselves without reference to the
more recent Congressional enactments which are sort of reduced
to Congressional dicta by the Appellee's views, sort of words
in the form of a statute, but without the command of statute.
So we have these action-forcing devices that there is
a national policy that all branches shall enforce that
national policy.

The Congress has placed primary responsibility

for that national policy upon state and local governments.
With respect to noi3e in particular, Congress has
said that absent a specific affirmative Presidential exemp­
tion, federal agencies are bound by the state and local
requirements and the City of Burbank has implemented that
statement, that national policy.
So what do we have?

A national environmental policy

which of the three branches of government, the legislative
branch has originated, the executive branch will appear in
support of as a friend of the courts and we ask that the

2*1

third branch o.f government, this Court, lend its support to
the National Environmental Policy and make it whole.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Yost, as I have understood your argument,

it is directed to the Appellee’s claim in this case, that there
is A, preemption and, B, specific conflict between federal
and local lav; which was the basis on which the Court of
Appeals decided this case.
Your argument is not directed at all, is it, to the
claim that this ordinance is an unconstitutional burden on
interstate commerce?
MR. YOST;

Only insofar — insofar as in — you

mean, commerce burden issue?

I think the United States’

brief handles that rather well but only Insofar as one of
the matters to be considered in determining whether there is
a burden is the congressional enactments concerning the
environment.
Q

But there is nothing in those enactments, is

there, that authorizes what would otherwise be an unconsti­
tutional burden on interstate commerce?
MR. YOST:
Q

They —

You could argue, X suppose, that the

necessary

implication of the legislation is, .but I don’t — you haven’t
argued that, have you,really?
MR. YOST;

Well, I think I — I have — I have not

25
argued it but I will argue it, that it becomes sort of
ridiculous to put aside the recent Congressional enactmenta in
the area if you then say that it has got to be

the burden

question has to be viewed in sort of abstract apart from what
Congress' most recent
Q

Well, it is a separate issue.

It is a separate

Constitutional question, is it not?
MR. YOST:

That is an accurate statement.

It

certainly is.
Q

And your argument has been directed, has it not,

at least primarily, to the preemption and the conflict aspect
of this case.
MR. YOST:
Q

That is correct.

Well., I suppose you could argue equally well

that if Congress has authorized local regulation, Congress,
with its plenary power over interstate commerce, has removed
any commerce argument from the case.
MR. YOST:
Q

That would —

You could argue that Congress has authorized

local government to impose what would otherwise be an
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and since the
congressional power is plenary over interstate commerce,
presumably it has complete power to do so.
MR. YOST:

That Is correct.

Rehnquist's statement of it.

I adopt Justice

26
Q

Excuse rne, and the state could bar all jet

aircraft from that airport.
MR. YOST:

I would take the same view that the

United States has, Justice Marshall, that each airport would
have to be viewed by itself on —
Q

But if this airport in this case had had an

ordinance put on it barring all jet aircraft, period.
MR. YOST:

I am reluctant to

venture an opinion on

something which we haven*t tried and there is no record on.
In the particular facts of the situation, they were barring
* /

something where there was, in fact, no burden on interstate
commerce because there were no Interstate commerce flights
shown.

I would want to examine a record which fully went

into the question of the implications for that particular
airport —
Q

Well, assume It did have half and half.

Could

you bar them all?
Because they were noisy.
MR. YOST:

I think, and again, looking at the U.S.

analysis, at the Solicitor General’s analysis, that as a
generality, the answer is yes.

However, it would have to be

viewed in its specific application, the importance of the
particular airport in the nationwide scheme and so on.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Yost.

Mr. Friedman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING APPELLANTS
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In both of the lower courts in this case, a brief
was filed in behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration
taking the position that this ordinance was invalid.

The

argument we mads was that there wa3 preemption of the subject
of noise by the Federal Government and that this ordinance
constituted an impermissable burden upon interstate commerce.
The brief’s discussion of the commerce —- sorry,
of the preemption point had almost no analysis of the
legislative history.

It was discussed one or two places very

briefly, a couple of quotations and references to committee
reports.
Now, when this Court noted probable

jurisdiction of

this appeal, the Federal Government undertook a lengthy and
detailed analysis of this case and of the issues.

The

Department of Transportation, of which the Federal Aviation
Administration is a constituent agency, studied the case very
carefully and the Department of Justice itself, both in the
civil division and the Solicitor General’s office, studied the
legislative history in depth.

We went into the thing in great

detail and the unanimous conclusion of all these people after

28
this study, was that the prior position we had taken on
behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration in this case
with respect to the preemption and commerce clause issues
was erroneous and, accordingly, the United States has now
filed a brief in this case and I am arguing here today taking
the position that the Burbank ordinance is valid.
Q

You were an amicus below for the FAA.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The FAA was an amicus in both the

District Court and the Court of Appeals.
Q

Certainly I would imply no criticism in this

question because, paraphrasing Justice Frankfurter, you —
one should welcome wisdom, even though it comes late but it
does kind of — it is rather — this rather is alien to the
adversary system of Justice, isn’t it?

It is a little bit

unfair to the District Court and the Court of Appeals and
ultimately to this Court to have a very influential amicus,
certainly with the expertise of the agency it is, to completely
change positions in the course of litigation.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, we feel

we have an obligation to this Court to present to this Court —
Q

I am not being critical at all.

MR. FRIEDMAN: — the point of view that we think is
the right one.
Q

But the end result is, perhaps, that it is a

little bit unfair to the whole Judicial adversary system,

29
isn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If I

may suggest rephrasing, I think

it was unfortunate that the ease developed this way, but before
this Court, there has been a complete development of the
fullest adversary positions.
Q

In fact -—

And it amounts to a one hundred, percent

confession of error on the part of the amicus.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

I know.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

You might say that, Mr. Justice.
That’s about what it is.
On the other hand, our opponents

have filed a separate brief, a long 43-page brief specifically
answering all points, so there is no question in this case
that the adversary process has been fully developed —
Q

Well, except not in the District Court and the

Court of Appeals.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Not in the District Court and the

Court — but there is no question, Mr. Justice in this case
with respect to any of the facts.
This is not a situation
the
in which/failure to present our arguments in the lower courts
might have been unfair in the sense of not presenting sufficient
evidence or a case in which the legal arguments perhaps
because they were not as fully developed in the lower courts,
have in any way prejudiced the the other side in this Court.
The issues are fully developed and they are, we
think, legal issues and I acknowledge it is an unusual situation.

30

Unfortunately, It Is not perhaps the first time that
the Federal Government has shifted position in this Court,
but we think *—
Q

This is never a happy situation.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

This is not a happy situation.

It

is one that we feel it is our obligation —
Q

In Its practical impact, I mean,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And, of course, the governmental

interest involved in this case, also, the interests of the
Department of Transportation which are broader, perhaps,
than those of the Federal Aviation Administration.
Q

This sometimes happens even in fields which

are not evolving arid changing fields, doesn’t it, when the
United States Attorney takes a position, perhaps, in the
southern district of California

and when the case finally gets

to you In Washington, you come to us arid take a different
position and then we now send It back and let you tell the
government’s view to the trial court all over, or the Court
of Appeals.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That has happened, Mr. Chief Justice.

I say, I agree with Mr. Justice Stewart.

It is an unhappy

situation, but one I think that Is inevitable under the
complicated government system that we have today.
Now, the Burbank ordinance In this case reflects
an exercise of traditional police power of the states.

What

31
Is involved here, basically, through the exercise of this
ordinance is the abatement of a nuisance, a traditional
nuisance noise.

This is a usual area of police power.

The

state has the authority to deal x^lth noxious odors, with
unpleasant sights and xvith loud noises.
about that.

There is no question

And this Court itself recognized in the Rice case

in 331 U.S. that when you are dealing with the traditional
power of the state, the police power to deal with these subjects,
that power is superceded by federal legislation only if that
was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.
Q

Well, then, you would concede that any airport

could control all noises, then?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Our position is that the airport

has authority to control noises with the exception that it
is at the airport.
craft.

It has no power to control flight of air­

That is the distinction we —*
Q

I know, but I was reading some studies made in

Long Island of the effect of noise from airports on the public
school children and that was much more disturbing than anything
X have seen in this record.
Would you say that New York State could ban jet
flights out of Kennedy or LaGuardia because they upset schools?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would think, as far as preemption

is concerned — just as far as preemption is concerned — I
would think that the state ttfould have the authority, if it

32

wished to prohibit jet flights in and out of a particular
airport.
To answer Mr. Justice Marshall’s question earlier,
I would think as far as preemption Is concerned — and I stress
just the preemption point, that there is nothing in the
federal regulatory scheme that would bar the City of Burbank
from prohibiting all jet aircraft from using the flight.
Indeed, the —
Q

That is still commerce.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Nc, commerce is another issue.

I am just talking of preemption.

But

In fact, there is nothing

in either the preemption or the coramerce clause that would
prevent the Burbank Airport from shutting itself down if
it wanted to.
Q

There might be other contracts to cover.
Now, we are talking here — we are mixing up

two very important things and that Is, the right of an airport
to shut itself down or to limit the hours of flight or to
limit all jets; the right of an airport owner and operator to
do that is one thing and It may be quite a different right
from what the right of a municipality has to tell an unwilling
airport operator you have to do It.
I think it is, as I read the briefs and the statutes
and the legislative history, there may be a considerable
difference between those two things.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Our position, Mr. Justice, is that

33
under the statutes* the Congress has not thus far preempted
the local governmental body from dealing with the question of
noise at the airport level.

This is our position.

We say

that the plenary power of Congress over interstate commerce
is broad enough to enable it to exercise its power.

We

acknowledge that Congress could, if it wished, say there shall
be no curfews at airports or that there shall be, or prescribe.
Our pos5„t±on 13, Congress hasn’t done it and that the
legislative scheme indicates that while it has left great
responsibility to the FAA in this area, the PAA itself has not
thus far undertaken to regulate this.

Now, if I may address

myself to the distinction between the airport operator as a
proprietor and the airport — the authority of the local
government to —

Q

I mean, your point is here, the airport

«

operator does not want this curfew.

He is being compelled to

do it and that is a great big difference from all you find
in the legislative history of his right to have a curfevr when
he wants one.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, this, Mr. Justice, if I may

respond on two levels to this.

First, this is true, I suppose,

in any case where the state undertakes to abate a nuisance.
Q

Well, except, as I, again, read the facts of
. >hM '

the matter, 99 and a half percent of the airports in the
country are operated by governmental agencies, so this question

doesn't arise.

If the governmental agency wants to Impose a

curfew5 it does so,
MR, FRIEDMAN:
Q

That — that Is correct —

And here is a private commercial airport, a

private airport, privately owned, serving scheduled airlines
which is almost unique, isn’t it, factually?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Factually,

yes.

In fact, we suggest

that that fact indicates how anomalous it would be if
Congress —
Q

Well, maybe it would be.

Thera are lots of

things in the law that are anomalous.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But I suggest, Mr. Justice, the

question is whether the Congress — whether the Congress
has manifested an intention to preempt this field and under the
analysis of the Court of Appeals in this case, the effect is
that Congress has preempted only basically the Burbank Airport.
It has said, as fair as Burbank is concerned, Burbank has no
authority to Impose this curfew.
As far as the Los Angeles International Airport,
20 miles away and a much larger airport, under its theory,
that airport does have the authority —
Q

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
the proprietor.
Q

— to impose a curfew because It is

Now, we think that’s —
Because that is what the law is.

That’s what

35
they held,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's — we think, Mr. Justice,

that when the various committee reports referred to the
authority of the airport owner, local municipal body as the
proprietor of the airport, they were not attempting to draw
the distinction between the local government body as proprietor of the airport and the local government body exercising
its police power.

We think all these statements were made

at the time when it was generally regarded that — generally
believed that the airports of this country, the major airports,
were being used, being run and operated by local governmental
bodies and this was —
Q

Your statements talked about operators of air­

ports, didn’t they?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The statements talked about

operators, yes, but —
Q

And the theory was that the owner and operator

of an airport, that’s his property and he can do with it
v/hat he wishes.

Isn’t that the theory that you find recurring

in the legislative history?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
that, Mr. Justice.

I don’t, in all fairness, agree with

We have other indications to the contrary

in the legislative history of this.

If I may refer to an

item at page 29 of our brief, which i3 a report made by the
House Commerce Committee in 1962 after a three—ear study of

36
the whole problem of noise at airports and this is paragraph
7.03 and this is what the committee said, "Until federal
action is taken, the local governmental authorities must be
deemed to possess the police power necessary to protect their
citizens and property from the unreasonable invasion of air™
craft noise."
Q

Mr. Friedman, I am still not clear.

Is it

your position that the City of Los Angeles, today, could enact
an ordinance precisely like the Burbank ordinance and say no
jet flights shall take off from Lost Angeles International
Airport between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the next morning?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Insofar as the question of pre~

emptlon is concerned, our answer is yes.
Q

Well, insofar as any federal regulation is

concerned?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
the commerce clause.

Well, there may be a problem under

We don't know.

There may be a problem

under the commerce clause because obviously, the impact upon
commerce of a ban on jet flights at night from the Los
Angeles Airport may be a very different thing than the ban on
the take off of jet flights at the Burbank Airport where the
record shows there were no commercial interstate flights
all.

at

But insofar as the question of preemption is concerned,

as far as preemption, yes, we think that there Is nothing in
the federal regulatory scheme that would bar the City of Los

37
Angeles from adopting such an ordinance and if X may just
refer* to one other thing, Hr. Yost spoke about the Kfoise
Control Act of 1972.

In addition to the general provisions

dealing with noise, there is

the specific provision of that

statute relating to aircraft noise and one of the things that
this statute did was to direct the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency to make a study and report to
Congress within nine months on a variety of topics relating to
aircraft noise, one of which was additional measures available
to airport operators and local governments to control airport
noise.

Such a study is now being made.
Wow, it seems to us this very clearly indicates that

the Congress that passed this law wanted to see what could be
done by both the local operators and by the local govern­
mental authorities to deal with aircraft noise.

And It would

be rather anomalous, we think, for Congress on the one hand
to have been requesting this additional information to see
how we could implement the power, how we could implement the
power under local government agencies and at the same time —
at the same time, in effect, to be saying, "But we have taken
away from the local government authorities any power to deal
with this."
We think the basis — the basic thrust of all of
this legislative history is that there is nothing in this Act
to indicate that Congress ever intended, at least until there

38
had been further action by the Federal Government , either the
Congress or the FAA, to bar tie local governmental authorities
from dealing with this serious and difficult problem of noise
and that is the way it stands and we think on that basis the
Burbank ordinance has not been preempted.
Q

Mr. Friedmans is it a paraphrase of your

answer to Mr. Justice Stewart that insofar as the preemption
point is concerned with Congressional interest in uniform
policy, it really doesn’t make any difference whether the
local initiative comes from the voluntary action of an airport
owner or from a municipal ordinance imposing a local require­
ment on the private proprietor for the premption.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Yes, that is correct, Mr. Justice.

Have you — you, too, have not really

addressed, except in your answer to Mr. Justice Powell, but
your basic argument is not addressed to the claim that this is
an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Just —

In your brief, I know you have said it should

be studied airport by airport.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

We have discussed it in our brief.

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Unfortunately, with the limited time

available, I couldn’t cover it, but our answer —
Q

I understand.

No, I just want to be sure that

39
I understood your argument, that It is not directed to that
question.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

We have dealt with

that in our brief.
Q

I understood so.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Christopher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN M. CHRISTOPHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLEES
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is the cornerstone
of the statutory scheme here involved and I think we have come
to the point in the argument where it would be worthwhile to
stop for a minute and consider the high points of that act and
the legislative history of that act.
Now, in enacting the 1958 act, Congress responded
to two fundamental and closely related defects in the prior
statutory history.

First, as the Senate Committee said about

the 1958 act, there had previously been a diffusion of
authority among many committees and boards.
Second, as the Senate Committee said, there was a
lack of any clear authority in the statutes for centralized
air space management.

By 1958,

it had become crucially

necessary for Congress to do something about this situation.
There had been a vast increase in air traffic and even by
that early date, Congress recognized that the nation's air
/

space was a diminishing and vital national resource.
Now, to correct this splintering of authority,
Congress vested, in the 1958 act, unquestionable authority
for all aspects of air space management in the PAA.

Indeed,

Congress went so far investing this plenary authority to say
explicitly that the administrator of the PAA should not be
required to submit his decisions regarding air space to any
other organization.
In addition, in this 1958 act, Congress — and It
is important to recognise this — authorized the administrator
to issue regulations for the efficient utilization of air
space as well as for the safety of aircraft.

This dual purpose

runs all through the statute, all through the actions of the
administrator,

the purpose of achieving safety and the purpose

of having an efficient use of a navigable airspace.
Now, in the 1958 act, Congress al3o gave the PAA
authority to issue regulations for the protection of persons
and property on the ground.

The amicus brief for the United

States vastly understates the importance of this provision,
asserting that the provision was only designed to provide
protection from insecticides sprayed during crop dusting and
saying that it was wholly unrelated to Congressional

consideration of the aircraft noise problem.
This is a demonstrably faulty reading of the
legislative history and unfortunately * this faulty premise
infects the entire government *s argument.

The government has

failed in its characterisation of this section to note the
statements in the 1962 hearings by Congressman Orin Harriss
the long-time chairman of the House Commerce Committee and
an architect of the 1968 Act, who explicitly said that that
provision of the 1958 act was addressed to the problem of
aircraft noise.

He said that the problem of crop dusting was

not the sole reason for Congress' enactment of that particular
section, but rather the section v/as in order to give broad
rule-making authority to the PAA in the field of aircraft
noise.
The government is also wrong as a matter of history
in saying that the authority conferred by this section of the
1958 act v/as used only at a few noise-sensitive airports.

The

fact is, as CAB Chairman Boyd testified, noise abatement runway
patterns were established under this section at every major
airport in the United States as early as 1962.
By this 1958 act which, as I say, is the cornerstone
and has to be our beginning point here, Congress vested in the
PAA plenary authority for airspace management and the
regulation of aircraft operation.

Under this statutory

authority of the administrator of the PAA, has issued

42
regulations which have been described as being o.f formidable
proportions., impressive detail and manifest sophistication.
Now, to understand the scope and the breadth of
federal control, Ifd like to ask you to consider with me, as
one of the witnesses did at the trial, the trial, the impact
of federal regulation on a typical flight from Hollywood™
Burbank Airport to San Francisco and the example I am using
here, I have chosen a flight from Hollywood-Burbank to San
Francisco because that is the most frequent destination, but
the scope of control would be the same if the flight had gone
to Phoenix or on the Burbank-Seattle route or any other
commercial flight.
Perhaps I should begin the description of this
imaginary flight by saying that each commercial aircraft on
this route has an airworthiness certificate and it has a
type certificate covering not only the airframe and the engine,
but every appliance on the aircraft and each aircraft is
flown in accordance with operation specifications which
authorize its operation into and out of each airport that it
serves.
Furthermore, each pilot must have a transport
certificate and each flight engineer mu3t be certificated by
the FAA.
Q

Mr. Christopher, so far, everything you have

told us is really what the ships and their personnel had to

have in the Huron Portland Cement, isn't that correct?

The

ship had to be licensed, so did the crews, remember, they had
to follow the Coast Guard safety patterns and so on.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

The fundamental difference between

that case and this, your Honor, is that in that case, the
federal regulation was directed solely at safety on the sea3
and the waterways.
Q

I suppose that is what an airworthiness

certificate is directed to, too, isn't it?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor, but the FAA under

both the 1958 act and the 1968 act is explicitly required to
balance not only those Interests but environmental interests
as well.

As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the PAA has to

take into account the multiple national interests involved,
national defense, aviation and environmental considerations.
That is a fundamental and basic distinction between thi3 case
and the Huron case.
If I can continue on with my Imaginary flight to
San Francisco, I think it is important to know that long before
this flight takes place, perhaps as much as 30 days, a flight
plan will have been filed with the PAA air traffic control
center for Southern California, a center that is responsible
for managing all the air space In Southern California and which
stores these flight plans in a computer.

Thirty minutes before

the flight takes place, the PAA center electronically informs

Jll»
fche tower, the PAA tower at Hollywood-Burbank Airport of the
anticipated flight so the tower can be ready to give the
necessary clearances to the pilot.

Whether the pilot gets his

clearance will depend upon conditions In the navigable air­
space .
These conditions are frequently abnormal or sub­
normals depending on matters such as weather, congestion,
terminal repairs, accidents or a combination of those factors
and when this happens, the PAA control center for Southern
California may tell the PAA tower at Hollywood-Burbank to hold
that aircraft on the ground or to modify the departure in some
respect.
Now, if the tower at Burbank is not directed by the
PAA center to hold the aircraft on the ground or given some
other direction, then the clearance would go from the tower
to the pilot but it is important

at this point to note that

when the aircraft is loaded, when the door is shut, the pilot
cannot begin to taxi on the runways of that airport until the
PAA tower clears him to taxi and clears him to the runway
which is assigned to that flight.

The runway which is

assigned will be the result of a number of factors including
federal noise abatement procedures.
Now, after taxiing to the designated runway, the
pilot must get a further clearance for takeoff from the PAA
tower.

I think it is important for our purposes to notice

44A
that before a plane can take off into the navigable airspace,
it has to be cleared by the FAA tower.

The PAA tower acts as

a control valve regulating access to the navigable airspace.
After takeoff, the airplane is monitored, directed,
supervised very closely by the Hollywood-Burbank tower as long
as it is itfithin the tower’s airspace.

Then it is transferred

to the center for Southern California; about halfway to San
Francisco, it is passed off to the Oakland center which, indeed,
it
then monitors/with great care and precision until it is in the
vicinity of the San Francisco Airport and then the PAA tower
at San Francisco guides it down into landing and once again
into the taxiing process.
It is by no means a hyperbole to say that every
aspect of this flight from the planning for it as much as 30
days ahead, the entry into navigable airspace and every detail
of the execution of the flight is supervised by the Federal
Airspace Manager, the PAA.
Now, it is our basic position, which I'll be
reiterating here, is that if there are to be restrictions
imposed into the entry .into the navigable airspace, they
should come from the federal agency which has been authorized
by the Congress to weigh the national interests involved and
to determine whether or not those restrictions should be
imposed.
Q

Mr, Christopher, what if the Burbank Airport

45
had voluntarily, on its own motion, decided to impose this
same restriction on flights between 11:00 arid 7:00?

Would

that decision be acceptable under your line of analysis?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, Mr. Justice, that raises

the question which is not here as to the scope and extent of
the power of an airport proprietor.

That power, being based

upon ancient property concepts, would no doubt depend some~
what on the law of each state but beyond that, I would want
to say that although the question is not here, there would be
important barriers at several levels to that action.
First, there might be constitutional barriers.

Such

a curfew might well involve an abridgement of rights under the
commerce clause.
Second, such a proposal might well be in conflict
with federal law in some respect and, finally, I think that
it is worthwhile 3aying that there may be

contractual

provisions that would prevent the establishment of such a
curfew by the proprietor.
That question is not here.

Unquestionably, the

proprietor has been saved from the full scope of the
preemption under the 1968 act, but what the scope of the
proprietor’s rights are is not yet determined.
Q

Well, are you suggesting, Mr. Christopher,

that a private airport, having been licensed, becomes something
of a common carrier in the sense that it must receive all

flights that are authorised by FAA?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, the private airport would be

in substantially the same situation as other public airports,
Mr. Chief Justice.

If they have established service and if the

ending of that service would involve a violation of the
commerce clause, I can see the possibility of insistence on
the continuation of that service.

There is no question but

that once a private airport undertakes to begin to serve the
public, it has obligations that may oontinue.

That would be

particularly true if that private airport had received federal
funds.
This airport received federal funds for control
tower and other navigationa3 equipment, but not for its
runways.
Now, as I move forward in this preemption argument,
I think it Is very significant to me that the United States
concedes in this brief that airspace management Is an
exclusively federal responsibility .

In our view and, we
*

believe, In the view of Congress, airspace management is a
comprehensive and invisible concept which Includes all
regulation of the use of navigable airspace.
Any entity, we say, which regulates the hours that
air traffic may flow Into the navigable airspace, is
inevitably involved in airspace management.

To allow local

entities to regulate this flow would, we say, fractionalize

47
air space management in direct opposition to the Congressional
purpose.
A curfew acts as a blockade on traffic in a manner
which we think is sharply inconsistent with the efficient
operation of the system.

We all know that congestion, with

its attendant threats to safety and efficiency, is one of the
principal problems of our air transportation system.

Yet

curfews not only increase congestions but they aggravate it
in the hours on the shoulders of the curfew where the
congestion is already the worst, so it is particularly the
hours between 6:00 and 10:00 in the evening.
The adverse effects of a curfew are greatly
aggravated, greatly multiplied in a country as broad as ours
where the impact is spread over six time zones and thus
magnified because of the effects of the time zones on
scheduling.
Once again, to come back to the central point,
restrictions so severe and debilitating to the system as
a curfew and as we believe a curfew to be, should be Imposed,
if at all, only by the agency entrusted by Congress with
overall airspace management.
Now, I have been at some pains to discuss the 195S
Act
Q

Mr. Christopher, do

you believe that nothing

has been done to establish curfews by the Federal Government?

48
And I emphasize the word "nothing.”
I®. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the

Federal Government, acting through the Federal Aviation
Agency and the manager being the manager of the National
Airport, has established a curfew at National Airport.

Now,

at that National Airport, the curfew is established by the
proprietor of that airport, by the Federal Government in its
role a3 airspace manager.
Q

Well, may I exclude the Federal Government in

Washington?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor.

country and I think —
Q

But you don't agree that they haven't done

anything about noise abatement?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

I certainly don't agree that

they haven't done anything about noise abatement.

I think

they have done all that they could do within the state of
the art.

49
Now, I have dwelled —
Q

But you haven’t done anything for these people

who want to sleep between 11:00 and 7:00 in this particular
town of Burbank, which is Mr. Sieg’s point, as I understand it.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Honor, I could not agree

that they have done nothing there.

They have established a

rum/ay use program and the planes now take off on the least
sensitive of the runways and they are required to do.

The

local airport PAA tower chief has established this runway use
procedure which, in his judgment is the best way to minimize
the noise at night.
Now, Ifva dwelled on the scope of the 1958 act
because I think it is a crucial backdrop for the 1968
amendment by Congress.

In 1968, Congress adopted an amend­

ment which explicitly provided that the administrator of the
PAA shall prescribe regulations for the control and abatement
of aircraft noise.

In the hearings on that bill, the

Secretary of Transportation was asked about the status of
local and state governments under the amendment.

He asked

Heim to submit a letter.

The letter

He submitted a letter.

was adopted by the Senate Committee and it has become a focal
point in this litigation.
Now, this letter, as the Justices have already
pointed out, makes a sharp distinction between the police
powers of local and state governments and the proprietary

50

power of an airport operator.

As to police powers, the letter

sayss state and local governments will remain unable to use
their police powers to control aircraft noise.
In contrast, the letter says, airport owners opera­
ting as proprietors will attain rights to take certain actions
with respect to noise.
Q

That letter is printed, I guess, several places

in the brief.

Can you just tell me one place in one of the

briefs?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor, it is printed

at the back of the —
Q

Government brief?

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

No, it is printed at the back of

the Burbank brief, your Honor, the Appellant's brief.
Q

We have quite a few briefs in this case, as

you know.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

We are at least partly responsible

for that, your Honor.
This is the back of that grey brief of the
Appellants, their main brief and it is in the first Appendix.
The sentences I am referring to, your Honor, are on page
number one, which is an unnumbered page, but down in the
middle of the page, you see the sentencesy"IIR3^00 would
merely expand the government's role in a field already
preempted.

It would not change this preemption.

State and

51
local governments will remain unable to use their police
powers to control aircraft noise by regulating the flight of
aircraft."
Q

Then "However."

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Then, "However, the proposed

legislation will not affect the rights of a state and local
public agency as the proprietor of an airport and so on.
Q

Right.

And this was a letter from the

Secretary, was it?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor, this was a

letter from the Secretary of Transportation to the Senate
Committee which he submitted after he had asked for an
opportunity to submit a letter and this was adopted by the
Senate Committee, which issued the'authoritative report on
this legislation adopted by this Senate Committee as its
statement of the rights of local and state governments.
Q

The Secretary was over there testifying

and he — I remember he —
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, sir, he was over there

testifying.
Q

— asked a question and he then asked

permission to file a letter.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

This was the letter.
That’s correct.

And the letter, you say, was adopted in the

committee report?

52
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

As Its own,

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

As its statement of the respective

rights of the local and state governments.
You see, your Honor, at the beginning of the
Appendix section which we have been reading together, the
Senate Committee says, "In this regard, we concur in the
following views set forth by the Secretary in this letter to
the Committee."
Continuing, then, I think it is important to note
that this same distinction is made in the unpublished letter
from the Department of Transportation to Congressman Fridell,
which the United States has printed as an appendix to its
amicu3 brief.
That is the grey brief.
Now, at page 67 of that grey brief, I think it is
quite significant to look at the sentence in the middle of
the page where, once again, the Department of Transportation
was telling Congress, this time the other House of Congress,
as a practical matter and as ATA concedes in its testimony,
the only regulatory authority left to local communities
or airport operators is the authority of the airport operator
In the exercise of its proprietary function to limit on noise
grounds the kind of aircraft which may use its facility.
It is hard for me to imagine a clearer statement of

53
the distinction between proprietary power and police power
than is embodied, first, in the letter of the Secretary to
the Senate Committee and then, in this more recently available
letter from DOT to Congressman Fridell.
Q

This doesn’t become a very important case, then,

if that is the distinction, does it, because, at least as I
understand it from the briefs, this is perhaps the only
airport in the whole United States that is privately owned
and that serves scheduled aircarriers.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Kono3’, I am glad to have a

chance to address that question.
it of others.

I noted it when you aslced

Although this is one of the few privately-

owned airports in the country, nevertheless the distinction
will be very important to many publicly-owned airports, for
although many cities own and operate airports, they very
frequently own and operate them in areas outside of their
own jurisdiction.
Q

In other words, Kentucky could pass a law for

the Cincinnati Airport, you mean?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

That’s right and we have shown in

our brief at page 35 and 36 the very many examples there are
of airports which are operated by cities or by counties but
which exist at least all or in part in other jurisdictions,
San Francisco, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Atlanta.
Q

This question isn’t here, is it, Mr. Christopher,

54
because, as I gather, the Burbank Airport is almost entirely
within the confines of the City of Burbank,
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

The question is here, Mr. Justice,

in response to the government's argument that it would be
so bizarre to have the preemption be this narrow.

The

preemption Is very important, not just for Burbank but to any
city airport which is operated In an area not wholly within
its own jurisdiction.
Q

Well, wouldn’t other constitutional and

statutory principles come into play If you had the State of
Kentucky enacting an ordinance that purported to effect In
the airport that was operated on the Ohio side of the river
or something like that?
Q

But it is on the Kentucky side.

The Greater

Cincinnati Airport is on the Kentucky side.
Q

But others might.

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, others might, Mr. Justice,

but this one certainly would and I think that is a funda­
mental position that we will be taking throughout the case.
Wow, the distinction ve are talking about here is
not at all an irrational one.

Indeed, the distinction is

rooted in the decision of this Court in Griggs versus
Allegheny County.

As we all know, in that case, this Court

held that the airport proprietor has to pay the bill if
flights are held to have constituted taking from this landowners

55
property.

Because the airport owner must bear the liability,

Congress created this narrow excerption from federal
preemption so that the proprietor could protect himself.

It

reserved these rights to the proprietor but it aid not reserve
them to cities because the reason for the distinction, the
reason for the narrow exemption from preemption did not exist
for the cities.
Q

Then dc I

understand you to be saying,

Mr. Christopher, or conceding that if your client, the owner
and operator of the airport, which is the — what, the
Lockheed Corporation or a subisdiary?
MR, CHRISTOPHER:
Q

Yes.

If your client wanted to impose this curfew,

it could freely do so without running into any problems of
either preemption or conflict?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Honor, I would have to say

that the scope of the proprietor’3 rights depends upon state
f

law and you’d have to examine very carefully whether or not
there might be some conflict with existing federal regulations.
You’d have to also examine whether or not the enactment of
such a curfew or the Imposition of It by an airport operator
would run afoul of the commerce clause or of contractual
obligations.
Q
conflict.

But I am talking only about preemption or
As I understood your argument, you have said that

56
the legislative history and the statutes show that the owneroperator, so far as preemption and conflict with federal law
go, could freely do this.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

Your Honor, I would say that —

Have I misunderstood you?

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Honor, I would say that that

is more true of preemption than it is of conflict.

If there

is an explicit PAA order saying that the airport shall remain
open at night, you might find that that would rim afoul of
what the proprietor did here.

I would say that, while

preemption and the full rigors of preemption may not be
visited on the airport proprietor, the conflict doctrine
remains.

Federal law would be supreme if the Federal Govern­

ment imposed a restriction which is absolutely contrary to
what the proprietor has done.
Q

But there is no such —

MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

There is no such restriction.

Neither in this case nor anywhere else that I

see in the briefs.

I’d thought that the whole idea was that,

as developed in your brief and in the Port of New York
Authority brief and so on, was that airport operators, under
the law and under the regulations, were kept free to do what
they wanted with their airports.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
your Honor.

That certainly is our position,

I — I simply did not want to mislead the Court

57
because I think that question will come up with a record that
Indicates — will indicate there may be problems under

the

Constitution of a different character or problems under the
contract of a different character.
I think that question is not here and it may be
quite a difficult question when it comes.
Q

Wellj then,

was the reservation of the power

in the Secretary's letter and other things that you rely on
to private airport proprietors really kind of an illusory
thing that doesn't amount to much in practice?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Not at all.

I think it is a very

important reservation of power that airport proprietors will
be exercising and have indeed exercised in the past, as the
Port of New York Authority's brief indicates.
Q

After all, as you pointed out, if, under the

lav/, the airport proprietor is liable to adjoining property
owners ,for — under the cases of this Court, he certainly
should have the commensurate power to cease the conduct that
would cause the liability.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Isn't that correct?
Yes, your Honor.

I don't know all

the things that were in the mind of Congress when they
created the distinction, but certainly that one thing was in
the mind of Congress when they created the distinction, but
certainly that one thing was in the mind of Congress, as
you can see from the committee reports and the letter to the

58
committee by DOT.
Now, the briefs of our adversaries have a difficult
time with this legislative history.

The brief reflecting the

views of the Department of Transportation tried to discount it
on the ground that Congress did not focus on the distinction
which seems to me to be a very strange position for an agency
which advanced the distinction and persuaded Congress to
accept it to be taking.
The United States also argues that it would be
bisarre to have the federal preemption apply only to a few
private airports but the fact is that the federal preemption
operates with respect to all airports, both public and private,
and it prevents the exercise of local police power to control
aircraft operations at those airports, whether they are
publicly owned or privately owned.
As I said to Mr. Justice Stewart, the situation
very frequently exists that an airport owner must face the
fact that he is in the jurisdiction of more than one entity
and he may be in a jurisdiction of quite a different entity
than his public body, the public body which — of which he is
i

a member and this situation exists all over the country.
With respect to the Hollywood-Burbank Airport, to
pick up on a question from Mr. Justice Rehnquist, even that
airport is subject to two jurisdictions, the City of Los
Angeles and the City of Burbank and they might well enact

59
conflicting or inconsistent regulations which would have a
very great potential for interference with the national air
transportation system.
As my time is going here, I’d like to move next to
the conflict issue, ’which I think is very significant in this
case.

It was the issue on which the Court of Appeals found

itself unanimous.
Nov/, the conflict arises here because, prior to the
enactment of the Burbank ordinance, the PAA had focused on
the subject of nighttime takeoffs and issued a noise abate­
ment order and b y this order, they established a certain
runway as the noise abatement runway which was to be used
between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m..

The Court of Appeals held

that this order represented a considered determination by the
FAA that the Burbank order is below the lowest practicable
minimum.

The tower chief had announced the noise abatement

procedures contained in this order were designed to reduce
noise exposure to the lowest practicable minimum and then the
Court of Appeals followed that up by saying that the order
represented a considered d determination that the Burbank
order was beneath the lowest practicable minimum and then the
Court of Appeals held that because this was so, the Burbank
order interfered with the balance set by the FAA in
accordance with the power vested in it by Congress.

Now,

the United States attempts to attack this conflict holding by

60

saying that the PAA order simply did not represent any
consideration of a locally-administered curfew.

The govern­

ment doesn’t offer any citation of authority for this simply
did not consider statement and there is none.
On the contrary, the district judge, who heard the
testimony of the tower chief and the other witnesses, found
that in issuing the order, the PAA had taken in hand the
subject of nighttime takeoffs.

We don’t need to guess about

the views of the PAA with respect to this order in their
amicus briefs in the lower court.

The PAA cited, appended and

relied on this order which the Court of Appeals then found to
be in conflict.
Q

What wa3 the time sequence, Mr. Christopher,

between the issuance of the PAA order and the enactment of
the municipal ordinance?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Well, the PAA order was substan­

tially before the enactment of the ordinance.
Mow, in trying to avoid this conflict which the
Court of Appeals found, the brief for the United States asserts
that the opposition to a curfew at Burbank by the PAA would
have constituted a major change in policy.

We say not at all.

In the appendix to our brief, this blue supplemental brief,
we have cited a number of examples in recent years in which the
PAA has gone on record as being opposed to curfews at various
airports around the country, in Southern California, in Texas

61
and New York State.
One of the most significant examples occurred right
in Los Angeles when, in I960, the FAA explicitly considered a
nighttime restriction but decided against it because of the
serious problems that it posed for the national air trans­
portation system.
Q

Maybe you said this and I didn't hear it, but

I have been attentive.

Has the PAA itself, on any privately

owned and operated airport, imposed any absolute restrictions
on nighttime takeoffs or landings?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Honor, I know of none.

The

only curfew imposed by the PAA of which I know is the one at
Washington National.
Q

And that, apparently is, in your submission,

not even a curfew, it is a voluntary agreement.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, that’s a voluntary agreement,

but the most significant aspect of it to me is that it is
Imposed by the airport proprietor and it is Imposed by the
national airspace manager, the Federal Aviation Agency.
Q

Do you — I suppose you not only would conceive

but would insist on the power of the PAA to do this if it
wanted to, wouldn’t you?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, by all means, your Honor.

You know, there are over 10,000 landing fields in the United
States.

There are over 3^6 of those landing fields that have

62
PAA toilers and there are about 1^0 airports which are air
carrier airports which serve more than 100,000 people a year.
Now, I certainly would not contend that each of
these

10,000 airports need to be operated all night.
Q

I would -

Well, there are many small airports, are there

not, still that cannot be and are not operated at night for
safety reasons?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Honor.

You are absolutely right, your'

Many of them do not have lights.

What we are saying

is that this is a question of power, not a question of whether
there

shouldbe curfews but who has power to impose them and

our basic argument is that

if curfews are to be imposed, they

represent such a severe and debilitating effect on the national
air transportation system that they should be imposed only by
a centralized agency.
Nov/, the

City of Burbank attacks the conflict on

one other ground that I need to note.

Burbank claims that

the procedures set forth in this PAA order are nonmandatory.
The record, however, is to the contrary.

The record shows

that the procedures became mandatory through incorporation
into the aircraft clearance.

Thus, the district judge

explicitly found that the preferential runway assignment is
incorporated into the aircraft clearance as an instruction to
the pilot.

If the pilot violates this instruction, he becomes

subject to a civil penalty and he may become subject to a

63
revocation, of his license.

Testimony in trial court showed

that this runway procedure, which was embodied in tjie

PAA

order, was followed except on a few occasions, when the tovier
itself permitted a deviation because of weather or other
operating conditions affecting safety.
So the net of the matter, as we see it, is the PAA
order is a considered determination regarding nighttime take­
offs by the agency empowered to do so and therefore is in
conflict with the Burbank ordinance.
In the remaining time, I would at least, as far as
my portion of the argument would go, I would like to discuss
the commerce issues which seem to me to have been perhaps not
adequately attended to up to this point, certainly not by me.
Now, the commerce clause has two separate and in­
dependent aspects and I think they both deserve a great deal
of consideration.
The first aspect relates to the holding of the
District Court that the Burbank ordinance operates in an
area where regulations must be prescribed by a single authority
and therefore, the commerce clause standing alone invalidates
the ordinance under the rule laid down
versus Arizona.

in Southern Pacific

The test under this phase of the commex’ce

clause is not whether regulations at each airport must be
precisely the same.

We recognize, as I was saying a minute

ago that different airports would require different treatment.

The test is whether regulation should come, in this instance,
from a single authority and we say that it must because of the
volume of air commerce, the speed with which it is conducted
and the technical complexity of airline scheduling and air­
craft maintenance.
Only through the uniform application of a national
policy, through centralised control by a federal agency, can
we properly cope with this unique form of transportation.
Q

Your argument basically relies on the

Inevitable Interrelationship of the airports around the
country because of 3peed and time and if something can’t
take off from the

west coast, then it can't take off from

somewhere else during the daytime and so on.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

Is that it?

Absolutely, your Honor.

The basic interrelationship.

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

The basic interrelationship and

we say that that is a reason independent of burden, Independent
of a burden analysis for holding here that the commerce
clause requires that these restrictions be imposed, if at all,
by a centralised authority.
Now, the national character of the system which
Mr. Justice Stewart was just referring to is demonstrated very
clearly by the PAA's flow control system.

Flow control

Involves the metering of aircraft so as to cope with
congestion or weather or other impediments to interstate

65
commerce.

Now, this flow control, as I illustrated in my

imaginary trip, may involve holding aircraft on the ground at
various airports.

It may involve establishing a special

separation between them in na%T±gable airspace.
Plow control was initiated by the PAA in 1969 and
at that time, they made it the responsibility of the PAA
center in each one of the regions of the country.

However,

only a few months after flow control was put in by the PAA,
the FAA found it essential to establish a centralized flow
control center in Washington, D. C. to provide national
coordination of these flow control decisions.

The PAA found

none of the regional centers had enough information to make
wise decisions for the system as a whole and I would say and
emphasize that national coordination is necessary for this
flow control.

It is vastly more necessary for such a lasting

restriction at airports as would be a night curfew,
I find it very interesting that in 1971 the
Department of Transportation took almost precisely the same
position with respect to the commerce issue as X have
asserting here.

been

This position was taken in a brief filed in

the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and with your
permission I'll read just one or two sentences from it:
"Air Transportation," said the DOT, "perhaps more
than any other form of commerce, requires regulation by a
single authority.

Even before 600-mile-per-hour flights

66
became the custom, Congress recognized this need by the
establishment of the Federal Aviation Agency," and to
continue this sentence from the DOT’S brief, "It would indeed
be a harmful and regressive step to permit a compromise of
the FAA’s authority through permitting the enforcement of local
laws or regulations regarding the use of navigable airspace."
This bried filed by the DOT in the Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts is quoted in full in the answering
brief of the Port of New York Authority.

Novi, I certainly

don't challenge the right of the government to change its
position in this matter. I have no criticism

of it but I

hope it won’t be improperfor me to say it seems to

me they

were right the first time.
Q

That was in a case in Massachusetts, an

opinion of the justices having to do with proposed legislation?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor.

That was an

advisory opinion of the justices with respect to legislation
banning certain supersonic aircraft from Massachusetts.
Q

And the court advised that it would be uncon­

stitutional legislation?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Ye3, your Honor.

Novi, the net of this first argument
commerce laws is

our view that Independent of

under the
other aspects of

the discussion today, independent of preemption, independent
of conflict, independent of the burden aspects of the

67
commerce clause, that under Southern Pacific versus Arizona,
the court should find that air commerce, because of its speed
and complexity, requires centralised management.
Nov;, the other aspect of the commerce argument
involves the holding of the District Court, that local
ordinances would constitute an
interstate commerce.

unconstitutional burden on

This is the burden issue.

The decisions

of this Court teach us that an ordinance ouch as Burbank’s
cannot be considered as an isolated phenomenon but must be
weighed and tested as if Imposed on a national basis.

This

rule has been uniformly applied, I believe, in decisions of
this court and it is especially appropriate, as thi3 Court
has said, where the restriction might interfere with the
efficient use of the channels of interstate commerce.
For instance, in the Southern Pacific case, the
Court said that it had to consider the consequences if all
50 states had

sought to regulate train lengths.

Similarly,

in Hood and Sons versus DuMond, this Court considered the
effect on commerce if other states were to have adopted
regulations comparable to those adopted by the State of New
York for the milk Industry.
In this particular case, the Importance of
considering local curfews on a national basis is emphasized
by the finding of the District Court that if upheld here,
curfews will proliferate and be adopted by virtually all

68
cities surrounding airports.
business.

It Is a very, very contagious

Several witnesses have testified to this contagious

character of the curfews and there seems little doubt that
many cities, as reported in the press, are watching the
outcome of this litigation and will enact curfews if they are
upheld here.
Now, the government takes the rather unusual
position that the nationwide effects of a restriction on
commerce might be appropriate in some cases, but is not appro­
priate here.

I think this Is an assertion on their part that

is unsupported and I find nc support for it in the decisions
of this Court.

Moreover, the government even revealed some

doubt about its own theory when it says in a footnote that
it would be appropriate to consider a curfew in relation to
existing curfews, previously enacted curfews when weighing
it under the commerce clause,
I think you’ll soon see that this is an extra­
ordinary theory which would produce very extraordinary
results.

Presumably the footnote means that at some point a

proliferation of curfews could result in a violation of the
commerce laws.

Does that mean if there are ten curfews

creating a violation that all ten are invalid?

Or does it

mean that the tenth one is invalid and the first ones are
valid, thus creating a race to the City Council to see who
can get there first.

Or does it mean on the other hand that

69
the tenth one makes the first one invalid but the tenth one
continues to be valid itself?
Well, I think you can see that the rationality of
the results

from such a test confirms the wisdom of this

Court’s long-standing rule that restrictions on commerce
should be judged as if applied nationally.

Evaluated on a

national basis —•
Q

Is the Bibb case —

MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, the Bibb case is very much in

point.
Q

— helps you in this

aspect of the case,

does it?
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, your Honor.

Restrictions

on commerce, especially those which Interfere with the national
system, must be weighed and tested as if imposed on a national
basis.
Evaluated on a national basis, the records seems to
me to demonstrate overwhelmingly that night curfews would
cause massive disruptions in commerce.

Curfew on jet take­

offs alone, without a curfew on landing, simply a curfew on
take-off3 alone like the Burbank curfew, would require
cancellation of more than 1,000 flights every single night.
Because over 48 percent of the airmail moves at night, a
curfew would delay not millions, but billions of pieces of
mail, at least one day, a delay which is certainly in sharp

70
conflict with our postal policy, which says that overnight
transportation of letter mail is the primary goal of postal
operations,
The effect of a night curfew on air cargo service
would be equally drastic.

Forty-two percent of air cargo

moves at night and, Indeed, the whole industry exists
dependent upon its ability to move cargo on an overnight
basis from one part of the country to the other and I think
we can see that the imposition of curfews on a nationwide
basis would have a severe hobbling effect if it wouldn’t
completely destroy this growing air cargo industry.
Continental Airlines, one of the carriers serving
Hollywood-Burbank Airport, made a thorough study of the
financial effect of the imposition of a Burbank curfew on
its entire system.

Continental Airlines found that its

operating costs would be increased by more than 25 percent
if there were a curfev/ throughout its system.

It would be

required alone to cancel ^8 flights a night and it would
have to purchase six new jet aircraft to replace the
cancelled services.
Q

Was Continental affected at all by simply the

application of the Burbank curfew?
I®. CHRISTOPHER:

Mr. Justice, Continental had just

commenced its service at Hollywood-Burbank when this case
was tried.

It was affected in the sense that its witnesses or

71
its witness testified that it was

inhibited from filling out

its service pattern on a flight from Seattle back to Burbank,
or would have been if the

curfew was in effect, but I would

have to say that it was too early in Continental

Airlines

service at Hollywood-Burbank for it to have really felt the
effect of the curfew on it.
Now, I’d like to briefly recur to one or two of the
points made earlier in the argument that with respect to the
National Environmental Policy Act, it seems to me that this
act is not at all consistent with the result below.

That act

requires federal agencies to consider environmental matters in
their decision-making process but it also explicitly provides
that Congress shall not exclude other essential considerations
of national policy in determining what policy shall be
imposed finally by the federal agency.
It is important to note that the National
Environmental Policy Act in a sense duplicates the 1968
amendment with respect to aircraft noise.

Under both NEPA

and the 1968 amendment, the PAA must and does take into
account environmental factors in its decisionmaking but
neither1 this statute nor the other statute cited was intended
to make environmental factor controlling over all other
factors.
Similarly, I think that it can be said that the
Environmental Quality Improvement Act i3 not inconsistent

72

with the result below, nor is its statement that state and
local government shall have primary responsibility for
implementing nationatlonal environmental policy.
These general expressions of congressional intent
cannot hardly overcome the special responsibilities which
have been imposed upon federal agencies and particularly the
PAA by Congress in the 1958 act, the 1962 and again, the
1972 act.
There has been a reference here also to the 1972
Noise Control Act and I think I should briefly mention that
the 1972 Act does nothing to alter the power relationships
as they were — existed prior to that act and as they are
imposed by the *58 and 1968 Act.
In the 1972 Act, Congress reaffirmed its intention
to look to the PAA for rulemaking in the noise abatement field.
The EPA, under that new act, is called upon to use its
expertise to recommend regulations but authority to issue
the regulations is retained in the PAA and in deciding what
regulations to issue, that 1972 Act again directs the PAA to
balance the multiple national interest involved.
Both the House and Senate report on the 1972 Act
stressed that it was not intended to change the law with
respect to the respective authorities of the local and state
governments, the Federal Government and the airport proprietors
as they existed before

73
I confess to being somewhat puzzled by the
assertion that this case is controlled by Rowe versus Wade.
Looking again at the slip opinion of that case, it seems to
me that — the Court, of course, will be much more familiar
with its holding than I am — there a state statute had
invaded a personal zone of privacy and was therefore struck
down as unconstitutional.

The Court held that the right of

personal privacy includes the abortion decision.

talcing or some other sort of taking, the property owners
might have brought an action.

That case is not here and has

not been done and so I could only express at least some
puzzlement as to the effect of that particular argument on
the Issues before the Court.
There has been some discussion here also stressing
that neither the statute nor the regulations involved
specifically deal with curfews, that they neither prevent
them nor impose them and therefore, the locally-imposed
curfews must be permitted.
I think if we look back at the decisions of this
Court, we'll find that that argument is not borne out.

The

7^
leading case on this point is Ilapler versus Atlantic Coastline,
272U.S.605, where the Court held that it was without legal
significance.

I believe that was Mr. Justice Brandeis held

it was without legal significance, that it was no

explicit

federal provision inconsistent with the local legislation.
The Napier case itself, if the Court will remember,
the Court struck down a state statute on automatic firebox
doors for locomotives, even though the ICC had. not dealt with
that subject.

How about all the states with full crew laws?

MR. CHRISTOPHER:
Q

No response.

You know the cases I am talking about.

I

can’t mention them by name.
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Yes, I know the cases.

Well, I don’t think they are inconsistent with the
result here, your Honor.

In every instance you go back to

what was the intention of Congress?

Did Congress intend to

preempt the field and where it has intended to preempt the
field, the fact that the administrative agency has not

Q

Well, wasn’t there some reliance in the

opinions in those cases upon the fact that neither Congress
nor the Commission had acted in the area?

75
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Your Honor, I think if, there was

reliance in those cases, but It was reliance In order to try
to eliminate the intention of Congress.

The failure of

Congress to touch a subject, of course, is the touchstone
here and it is what the whole discussion is about.

I mention

in passing also that the Napier case v/as followed by the
BEtheiehem Steel case in 330 U.S. at 769 and once again, the
Court held that the failure of federal regulations to cover
a particular subject matter did not mean that that subject
matter was not within the preempted field.
Coming to the conclusion of the argument here today,
your Honors, I would like to once again return to the question
of airspace management, which I think Is central to this

appeal./common grounds at least between the Appellees and the
United States that airspace management is exclusively a
federal responsibility.

V/e say that any entity which controls

inevitably involved in airspace management.
As we have seen, curfews have dramatically an adverse
effect on the congestion problem, on scheduling and on
maintenance and on the system as a whole and we urge that
restrictions which have such a severe and adverse effect on
transportation, air transportation particularly, should come
from a centralized agency which has been entrusted by Congress
with all aspects of airspace management.

76
Thank yous your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sieg, I think we'll

let you resume and not split your argument.

You have four

minutes left and there is only a minute and a half now.
We will recess.

Mr. Friedman, I under­

stand you have about five minutes left before this Court.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Justice.

Five minutes.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I have five points I would like to make in those

five minutes.
The critical distinction, we think, that appears in
this legislation in terms of what Congress is attempting to
do here wa3 between the regulation of flying and all aspects
of flying which we think has been preempted by the federal
legislation and the repudiation of airports, which has not.
The comprehensive regulation is a regulation of
the airspace, a regulation of safety, a regulation of the
flight of airoraft.

But we think It is not a regulation of

the airport itself.

Mow, of course, things that happen on

*

the airport are related to flight.

Obviously, if the airport

refuses to build an additional runway that is necessary, it
is going to make it more difficult for flight to take place,
but that is not the kind of thing, we think, that Congress is
referring to when it keeps speaking in these terms and I’d
like to refer specifically to the letter from the Secretary
at the Appendix to the Appellants’ brief which
Mr. Christopher referred to.

What the court letter said was,

78
"The courts have held that —"
Q

What page are you on In that Appendix?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

This Is the first unnumbered page of

the Appendix after —
Q

All right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

— the green-blue slip at the end.

"The courts have held that the Federal Government presently
preempts the field of noise regulation insofar as it involves
controlling the flight of aircraft."

And in the next sentence

they cite a case called The Town of Hempstead

which was just

that, the village of Hempstead attempted to control the flight
of aircraft in and out of Kennedy Airport by saying that a
plane could not fly over the village of Hempstead if he
emitted noise beyond a certain level.

That’s what they were

talking about, which was repeated again at the end of that
paragraph, "State and local governments will remain unable to
use their police powers to control aircraft noise by
regulating the flight of aircraft."
And, of course, that is precisely what the preferen­
tial runway regulation that is involved in this base attempts
to do.

That controls the flight of aircraft.

how a plane is to
Q

That determines

take off, in which direction.

What about the other language in that letter?

I’m not sure to what it refers.

The language is, "The

legislation," and I’m not sure of the antecedent, "operates

79
in an area committed to federal care and noise limiting rules
operating as do those of the ordinance —"

I assume that is

the Hempstead ordinance.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That's right.

mu3t come from the federal source."

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But that, Mr. Chief Justice, is with

reference to an ordinance that attempted to control the flight
of aircraft.

What Hempstead was attempting to do to control

the way in which planes landed and took off and approached
the Kennedy Airport by saying planes which make more than a
certain amount of noise cannot fly over our city and that is,
we think, what Congress had reference to when it spoke of
controlling the flight of aircraft.
And we think the whole policy that is reflected in
this congressional debate in the PAA's consideration of it is
the recognition that when you are dealing with 3uch things as
whether planes should or should not be permitted to take off
from an airport, that is a matter of fundamental local policy.
There are conflicting interests involved.

On the one hand are

the interests of the members of the traveling public and the
industry in the area of getting the best possible air service
obtainable.
On the other hand — on the other hand, there is an
equally strong, perhaps a greater interest of the people,

the

interest of the people in these areas of being able to get a

80

good night's sleep and this is the kind of balancing of
conveniences that traditionally is left to the local governing
bodies to decide.

The town council of Burbank made the

judgment that whatever may be the effects of this on air
service — and it seerns quite clear it is minimal here —
that, nevertheless, that adverse effect is more than outweighed
by the benefits to the people in this surrounding area of
having freedom

from the noise when they are trying to sleep.

Now, the runway preference order, I might add one
other thing about it.

There is no authority, the FAA informs

us, in an alrtower controller to impose a curfew.
thing he can do is these preference runways.
runways are not mandatory.

The only

These preference

Page 454 of the record which

contains text of the order at the second full sentence in that
paragraph is saying the procedures are not mandatory on the
part of the pilot, however, traffic controllers must be
noise-abatement conscious and emphasize noise abatement in
order to obtain the highest degree of voluntary cooperation
from the pilots.
Q

Mr. Friedman, could Hempstead pass an ordinance

saying you couldn't fly over Hempstead between 11:00 and 7:00?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Mr. Justice.

Hempstead could not do that.

Q

I would say most clearly not,

No.

That would be a

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

You just say, there shall be no flying.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

No flying overhead?

The same as this.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Pardon?

Pardon?

That is not a regulation of flying.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, but if there were an airport,

if there were an airport within the City of Hempstead,
Hempstead could say no plane could take off from that airport

between the hours of 11:00 and
Q

7:00.

If Kennedy was in the same county as Hempstead,

that county could pass a regulation in Kennedy saying that
you can't fly any planes out of Kennedy between 11:00 and 7:00.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

As far as the Federal Aviation Act is

concerned, yes, Mr. Justice.

That might present a different

commerce problem at Kennedy than it presents at Burbank, but —
Q

I was just saying, this is so unimportant,

this little Burbank Airport, but I think Kennedy does have a
few flights.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Kennedy has many flights, but,

Mr. Justice, in terms of the impact on commerce, it seems to
us it does make a substantial difference whether you are
dealing with a little airport like Burbank, which has no
commercially-scheduled flights —
Q

But you said the same rule would apply to

Kennedy.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

respect to preemption, yes.

With

That is, if I may restate it,

as far as the federal regulatory scheme is concerned.

The

federal regulatory scheme does not operate to prevent an
aircraft — prevent an airport from being told it cannot
take — permit certain noise things at the airport as
distinguished from the actual commencement of the flight.
Once the plane is on the runway and starts to take off, even
though that is in the airport, that is an integral part of the
flight.

That is the beginning of the flight and that is

preempted.
now.

And all we are saying is that it is not preempted

At least, thus far, Congress has not attempted to take

over the regulation of airports.

Congress could do it under

its broad power over interstate commerce, Congress could do it,
either itself directly or Congress could do it acting through
the FAA and maybe someday it will do it.

The matter is under

study.
Maybe a year from now the FAA will conclude either
that there should be a ban on curfews or decide to put in
curfews.
does that.

Our point is, unless and until Congress affirmatively
Unless that happens, this matter is within the

control and the authority of the local police power.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
