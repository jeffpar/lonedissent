ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. R. MC CLELLAND
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MC CLELLAND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
«>

I think I would be remiss if I did not first
convey my appreciation to the very honorable Clerk and his
staff for their assistance to us in this matter? and they
are very nice, very nice.
The facts in this case» as I understand, are not
in dispute by any of the parties here, so I will be very
brief and cite only those things which I consider pertinent
to the case.
One, that in the year 1957» Mr. Morris qualified
for and started receiving Social Security benefits? that in
the year 1965, Linda Gail Kinder was born, and a few months
after that, was sent to the home of the grandparents — in
this case, Mr. Morris — and to reside with them continuously
thereafter until the present time, as a matter of fact.
In October of 1966» Mr. Morris and his wife adopted
J

Linda Gail? in 1968, there was a reapplication for Social

4
Security benefits by Mr. Morris on behalf of Linda Gail, which
was, and what is an issvie here.
The pertinent parts of the Social Security Act that
we talk about today, one has to do with Section 202(d)(1) and
(3)o

These are the ones that set up eligibility for children.
(d)(1) here states that a child shall be entitled

to benefits if the child is living in the home of the
petitioner, and that he is contributing more, at least 51
percent of the support, and so forth, of the child.
Section (3) has to do with eligibility, and again,
Linda Gail is qualified under that Section.

In that Section,

it starts out saying that "shall be deemed" to be dependent;
this has to do with the dependency clause.
Another issue here is 202(d)(8).

In 1960, when the

Social Security Act relative to dependency allotments was
first passed, Congress saw fit to give benefits to children
born of qualified Social Security recipients.
Subsequent to that and shortly after, they put in
the Section pertaining to adopted children, if the child lived
in the home of the petitioner, or recipient, at least one year
prior to the time that he shall have reached his old age or
disability, or what have you.
In 1967, subsequent to the date of the adoption of
Linda Gail, Congress amended this particular Section and put
in this 202(d)(8); and they started talking about children

5
adopted by an eligible beneficiary recipient.
Here, the key one in which we are interested today
and upon which this Court accepted this case has to do with
child placement.

Congress said that if a child can -- on

the adoption, at the adoption proceedings — was supervised,
or was handled through a public or private child placement
agency, then this child, adopted child, could qualify for
benefits.
I might also add here that on October the 30th of
1972, that Congress again amended this Section 202(d)(8), and
we are now back to where we were in 1960, which means that
unless a child shall have lived in the home of the petitioner
for not less than one year prior to the time that he reaches
eligibility for old age assistance or the date that he would
become eligible for request for disability benefits, that
the child cannot qualify.
QUESTION:

Because of that 1972 amendment, it is the

Government's position in this case — and that amendment,
incidentally, came along after we granted certiorari in this
case — it is our position in this case that the writ should
be dismissed; I trust you will address yourself to that
argument.
MR. MC CLELLAND:
QUESTION:
means.

It is the very next item, sir.

Right; very good; in your own time, by all

6
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Pertaining to this and the fact,

that respondent, has raised this issue of 'whether or not this
writ

was improvident!y granted, 1 would like to say this, that

I am happy that the question was raised because that does
bring — at least I would hope that it would bring — this new
amendment before this Court, for consideration today.
One —
t

QUESTION:

Why don’t we get the new amendment

before us?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

I say, sir, that. I would hope that

you would, the fact that wa are considering that at this
time.
QUESTION:

Has there been any administrative action

under the law as changed?
MR. MCCLELLAND»
answer is negative.

So far as this is concerned, the

So far as other cases that have been

started, the answer is yes, sir, there has.
QUESTION:

We have only this case before us.

MR. MCCLELLAND:
that

You have only this case before you,

is true, sir.
QUESTION:

No one is trying to apply this new

statute to Linda Gail's situation?
MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

On tiie Government’s theory, Linda Gail

doesn’t get benefits either under the law

that’s before us

7
hera or under the new law, so there is no occasion to apply
anything new.

The result would not. be different, from the

Government's point of view.
MR. MCCLELLAND:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Further, that by virtue of the repeal of this
particular section in the Social Security Act, that this
client, Linda Gail, would not be affected,
reasons.

and for several

One of them was that her application for benefits

was timely filed.

In other words, she applied for benefits

under this new section in February of 1968, the year that
particular section went into affect, 'I think in January or
December — January of 1967.
The rights of many people, or individuals,similarly
situated as Linda Gail would be in this particular instance
have not been affected by the repeal of this new Act in Social
Security, new 202(d)(8).
on that section.

There are other cases pending now

No later than I think last waak or week before

last a new case was started in my own home county affecting
the same.
And also this new Act will affect only a small
class of plaintiffs because those that are not witnin this
classification of having lived with the beneficiary for, let's
say at least a year prior to his eligibility, would be affected;
the others would not.
QUESTION*

if the 1972 amendment (inaudible)

8

Linda Gail would have been ineligible, is that, not true?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Sir, on issues that I am bringing

forward hare today and the issues of discrimination against
adopted children, they would not be affected either way.
Let's assume that you should decide at this particular
moment, right now, that this case has been irr.previdently
granted, I could and I am sura that X would be requested to
do so, to go home and ask Mr. Morris to go out and reapply,
that the issues of the Fifth Amendment as affects afteradopted children must go before this Court, for determination,
sir.

That is one of the cruxes in this case.
The case was first started, and the court below,

the District Court, the District Court judge decided to
take the same position as the Hearing Examiner.
into this.

He didnst go

Only briefly was it brought up in the Appellate

Court.
Those questions are still here.

I would bring this

case next week under the new one because the same issues are
there, sir.
QUESTION:

The same

MR. MCCLELLAND:

(Inaudible).

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And I might also add that this question of the
Fifth Amendment was considered in the cases below.
QUESTION:

Is it your position, Mr. McClelland, the

same Fifth Amendment issues are here under the amended

9

statute?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

As it affects after-adopted

children, sir, as against children born as issue of the
recipient.
QUESTION:

Or/and as against pre-adopted children.

MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That it’s a basic denial of equal

protection of the laws included in the due process clause in
the Fifth Amendment.
MR. MCCLELLAND:

That’s exactly right, sir.

Yes, sir,

There are a couple of things I would like to say,
and I will get into this particular question right quick and
try to take most of my time on that.
•y

As Mr. Justice White told Mr. Reynolds here yesterday,
he said, "And your fifth argument is the fact that the Circuit
Court of Appeals held against you, and so forth," I will say
that here in addition to this, the case of Hagier v. Finch
which was relied on by the Fourth Circuit and their holding
in this case, together with strong reliance on the part of
the Respondent in his brief here.
There is a literal statement in that court opinion
that I would like to read to the Court, here.

Nov/, in the

fcaglsr case, of course, this Court denied certiorari.

But

after having admitted that this child, there was no abuse
involved so far as the adoption of this child was concerned,

10
the Court, said this:
"The Haglers, lacking guidance through the statutory
maze of 402(d) wandered into a trap designed to snare only the
undeserving.

Their plight suggests a need for more flexible

statutory requirements.

Yet Congress, not the Court, should

be the source of any new statutory provisions."
So the two cases that, obviously are relied or-, here
is the Fourth Circuit holding the way they did and the
Ninth Circuit holding the way that they did.
The main thrust of my argument — I will get. away
from the cases that have been decided and have been cited in
the brief and so forth, like Levy and Weber and Stanley and
so forth, and get to one that was recently decided by this
Court no longer than less than a month ago, as a matter of
fact, on December 18, I think it was, where they affirmed
the case of Davis v. Richardson, 342 F„ Supp. 538 it. was.
Thera we are talking again in terms of an illegitimate child.
I will not go into the facts of that case; it is
too recent, to this Court.

You are sort, of familiar with it

and what you decided, and so forth.

I will stay away from

the holdings relative to Social Security and wolfare.

But

(1) and (2) I would like to read because as a guideline for me.
v

(1)

The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment

prohibits as to the Federal Government, statutes creating
arbitrary discriminations which have no rational basis in

1 1

Jm./L,

6

legitimate governmental purposes.
And (2) that although currant Congress has great
latitude to make clarifications in tha area of economic and
welfare legislation, a provision must have some rational
basis or be pertinent to some proper objective of Congress
in order to withstand challenge of the due process clause.
Your Honor, the fact that. Congress has seen fit to
deny after-adopted children which they have dona tha benefits
that are now accruing to those children that have bean
previously adopted or children that will be born to the
Social Security recipients subsequent to his receiving benefits
I think falls decidedly~withxn..fchis classification.
When Congress considered this thing and reading the
Congressional Record on what they had to say, now, Senator
Allott got into the question of will this cause abuse and
cause individuals to go out and adopt children to supplement
their own income?
mention on that.

There are two things I would like to
Senator Curtis also had some observations

on that.
One of them is they took their external

expert

there and he came back and said, wall, look, there would be
maybe a fraction of one percent involved should we grant
full benefits to these adopted children.

They admitted on

the floor that they each knew of personal cases where it seemed
■unjust to not give these individuals the privilege of being

12
entitled to these benefits.
I think, sir, and this is my —
QUESTION:

It was Senator Allott5s bill, was it

not, that put the limitation upon the eligibility of afteradopted children that you are here attacking, that is, that,
it had to be approved by a child-placerasnt agency.

And that,

was his bill.
MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

So

That's correct, sir.
when he was talking about no

substantial possibility of abuse, he was talking about no
substantial possibility of abuse under his bill which became
law and which you are now attacking.

So I don't know that

his remarks are very helpful to you.
MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

No.

X am only —

The bill that ha sponsored —

MR. MCCLELLAND;

In this particular instance, sir,

I am not attacking the bill.

T. am all in favor of his bill.

But I am atfcenvpting to attack and starting to attack the
question of abuse in this

particular instance as it would

affect this question of consideration between the two classes
of individuals.
QUESTION:

Well, the problem in this case is that

the law which was, as I understand, it, had its genesis in a
bill sponsored by Senator Allott and supported by Senators
Curtis and Dominick and obviously by a majority of- both Houses

ultimately that that, bill contains

in it a limitation for

eligibility of adopted children that those adoptions had to
have taken place under a child-placement agency.

That's the

nub of the question, isn't it, in the casey that, provision of
the law?
MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And it has been held by the agency that

a court, a juvenile court or any other kind of a court, is not
a child-placement agency within the meaning of that provision
of

the Federal law.

That's what the issue her® is, isn't it?

MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Congress had two objectives, did they not;

First, to prevent people who were in this position receiving
benefits from exploiting the potential benefits that would be
paid to the adopted child and to see also that the adopted
child was not taken into homes that were not adequate.
MR. MCCLELLAND:
QUESTION:

Correct, sir.

Now, hasn't the Court said many times

in many cases that the fact that a regulation may occasionally
reach seme blameless person when it's aimed at a larger target
of preventing abuses, it will ba sustained?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

That also is correct, sir.

But what I am saying hare this morning, sir, is that
the possibilities and the probabilities of a grandparent
adopting a child for the purpose of obtaining money, I think

14
is just too far reract© for such a consideration.
QUESTION:
specific cases.

Congress doesn’t try to legislate on

It legislates for the generality of situation;,:,.

MR. MCCLELLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, of the 200-some-

odd cases that we have relative to adoptions that we havehad

since I have bean with this particular program in the

last six years, more than 50 percent of them have been
grandparents adopting children.

I would dare say that no

one of those grandparents, whether the child be legitimate
or born out of wedlock, the question of men ay does not. enter
into it.

It's a question of love and affection on the part

of grandparents.

That goes back to the beginning of man, I

am sure this Court, is well aware of that.
QUESTION:

What is the purpose, then, of their

adopting the grandchild?
MR. MCCLELLAND;

For tine purpose of providing a

home for them, generally, sir.
QUESTION:

Can't they do that without adoption?

MR. MCCLELLAND:
they do do it.

They could do that and in many instance?

But when —

QUESTION:

Might it also be to give the child a

name and making the child legitimate?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

That's correct.

For those born

out of wedlock, that's true, sir.
QUESTION:

But that does not apply to those born in

15
wadlock.
MR. MCCLELLAND:

But it do©s do, however, sir, in

the absence of a natural parant, it does provide for them and
give to them short of going out and getting and requesting
the guardianship tha legal rights to the child to order
certain tilings done on their behalf.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that all the

grandparent-grandchild adoptions are situations where a natural
parent is absent in death or something?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

As a general thing, sir, I will

say this, that the children come to a grandparent during times
of adversity regardless of what that adversity happens to be.
QUESTION:

Under the law of West Virginia, does an

adoption alter in any way the status of an illegitimate child
and may render it legitimate?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Under our

laws —
QUESTION:

Adoption by a grandparent or a stranger?

Or is it just limited to adoption by the parents, natural
parent?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Any adoption, sir, under our

adoption laws puts the adopting parent in the same position
exactly as if that child had been born in lawful wedlock in
any and every respect.

Our courts and our laws have been in

following that classification, have gone just as far as they

16
possibly can in doing that.
QUESTION;

Mr. McClelland, would you follow up a

little bit on Mr. Justice Black's

question to you just

what is it besides financial benefits that a grandparent
gets from legally adopting a grandchild that he couldn’t do
without simply having the grandchild live in his home?
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Well, for one thing, sir,

authorization for medical attention, surgical attention and
that sort of thing.

For the responsibility of the child

as a parent rather than, let’s say, as a foster parent or
just as a friend, as a babysitter.
QUESTION:

What tangible elements flow from that

responsibility?
MR.

MCCLELLAND:

That this child then, becomes for

all intents and purposes a natural child, that the name is
changed, that in the records no reference will ever be made
by anybody in the future that this child was not a child
born of this actual marriage.
inheritance.

They receive the rights of

The natural parents lose that same right.

All

the rights and responsibilities under an adoption in West
Virginia flow to an adopting parent and to the child just the
same as if the child had been born in lawful wedlock.
As pertains to when we are talking about benefits
and so forth, had in this particular instance Mr. Morris- —
at the time he adopted this child, of course he could not have

17
taken advantage of going through a chi Id-placement agency,

lie

adopted the child a year previous to the time this law went
into effect, a year or two maybe.

If he had chosen to,say,

as the Fourth Circuit put it, well, he could have given this
child to the welfare department and then the welfare department,
could have given it back to him and that would have been all
right, then there would have been compliance with this require­
ment.

But, sir, if he wore going to give her to the welfare

department or child-placement agency under our lav/s the best,
thing for the child, according to law, ha may or may not have
gotten the child back.

If they could have found a good home

for it, they would have placed this child elsewhere.
QUESTIOH:

Are you implying Mr. Morris' home wasn’t

a good home?
MR. MCCLELLAND;

Ho, sir.

No, sir.

I am saying

that a placement agency could have don© that, or our welfare
department which is about the only thing we have in the State
of West Virginia at. all that comes close to being a childplacement agency or public placement agency.
But had he done this, had he set up his home as a
foster home and said, "Now, you send this child over to me
as a foster child,"

since the parents were then gone, he

would have gotten more money by the foster home placement
angle than he \tfould have in Social Security benefits.
difference of about $S a month.

It’s a

18
The question of the real issue ®f why we are here, I
would like to catch you right quick with before my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

(Inaudible) since your

time has expired now, Counsel.
MR. MCCLELLAND:

Thank you, sir.

And that has to do with the question of our court
here and whether or not this is properly heard before our
Juvenile Court and whether or not that is a placement agency.
And since ray time is almost up, your Honor, I respectfully
request of this Court that that question, I think is fully
covered really within our brief and I would ask that this
thing of child placement agencies as it relates to the West.
Virginia law would be considered by this Court on brief.
Thank you so much for your consideration.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 3URGER:

Thank you, Mr. McClelland.

Mr. Fleischer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER H. FLEISCHER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FLEISCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think that a short review of the development of the
provision dealing with benefits for adopted children may be
helpful in assessing both whether there are issues which ought
to be decided now despite the repeal of the disputed provision
after certiorari was granted, and also on the merits of those
issues

19

Before 1960, child benefits were not payable unless
the child was born or adopted prior to the wags earner's
disability.

In 1960 the Act was amended to permit payment to

natural children born after the disability and also to adopted
children who were adopted within two years of the disability
if the adoption proceedings had been started prior to the
disability or the child was already living with the wage
earner.
: Petitioner was not entitled to the benefits under
that 1960 provision.

And the idea of the 1960 provision as

stated in the committee reports was to assure that benefits
will be paid to such children only when there is a basis for
assuming that the child lost its source of support whan the
worker became disabled or died.

And further, Congress said

that its purpose was to guard against abuse through adoption
of children solely to

qualify them for benefits.

Both, in our view, are perfectly proper concerns of
Congress, and the question is whether the later 1968 provision
bears a rational relationship to those concerns.
Now, you will also see the relative emphasis
Congress has given these considerations has changed over the
years and particularly between 1968 and 1972 provisions.

And

this is one reason that we disagree that the constitutional
issue would be the same under the 1972 amendments as it is
under the 1968 amendments, and therefore this is on© reason
(

20
we don’t think that tills broad issue is appropriate for
decision now,,
Now, in 1968, Congress liberalised the provision of
Section 202 dealing with adopted children of disability
beneficiaries by providing benefits for not. only those whose
adoption was contemplated at the time of the disability, but
after .adopted children met certain tests, particularly that
the adoption be court decreed and that, it be supervised by a
child-placement agency.

It was felt that those two requirements

would provide adequate protection against adoptions for the
purpose of obtaining benefits, though they would cover certain
hard cases which had arisen under the old provision.
It will be noted that the 1968 provision somewhat
departed from the earlier idea that, the statute should, aim only
at taking care of children who lost their source of support
when the wage earner was disabled.
move back in that direction.

But the 1972 amendments

They still allowed benefits

based on later court-decreed adoption irrespective of the time
the court decrees the adoption, but they do so only when the
child lost the source of support because his parents retired
or became disabled.

That is, they provide that the child

must have been living with the wage earner for a year prior
to the disability, receiving at least, half his support from
the wage earner.
QUESTION:

What is involved here is the law as it

21
was in the period 1968 to 1972»
MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
QUESTION:

And the issue here,, as I understand it

you tell me, please, if I misunderstand it — is the validity —
it boils down in net balance to the validity of the regulation
that says that a court is not and cannot be a child-placement
agency.

That’s the specific issue, isn't it?
MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, and this attacks
QUESTION:

(inaudible)

(Inaudible) impact in this West Virginia

case where the criminal court in this county acted as a
juvenile court and where the court got their local policeman
to make an investigation of the home,and the claim is that
not to allow this kind of a situation is a deprivation of due
process of law.
MR. FLEISCHER:

Yes, sir.

That’s what is left of this case.
not moot.

I think that’s correct.

This particular case is

We were aware of no other case pending —
QUESTION:

Could you tell me why the new 1972

amendment does not apply to this case?
MR. FLEISCHER:

Yes, Mr. Justice White.

Section

111(b) of the 1972 amendment provides a specific time clausa,
and while it's a bit ambiguous the Social Security Administra­
tion has interpreted that clause to mean that as to applications
filed before the 1972 amendments became law, that the applicant
gets the best of the two.

22

QUESTION:

If by some possibility the applicant was

disqualified under the 1968-72 provisions, he could still
take advantage of 'the 1972 Act if he qualified under that?
MR. FLEISCHER:

Yes.

But I must say that it is quite

clear that this plaintiff does not.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand.

MR. FLEISCHER: Now, that’s v/hy this case is not moot.
The is sues stemming from the placement agency requirement are
of no general or-prospectiva importance.

There may be a few

applications still pending which raise it, but —
QUESTION;

The 1972 provisions would not be applied

to disqualify someone who had qualified under a previous —
MR. FLEISCHER:

That is correct.

Nov/, turning to the merits, I believe that both the
Petitioners — well, I should say one other thing about the
viability of this in cases before turning to the merits.
And that is that the entire controversy in the courts
below, both statutory and constitutional, was based on the
particular feature of the adopted child benefit provision,
that is the supervision feature.

The broader challenge to

Section 202 as discriminating between adopted and natural
born children was not considered below.
first court which has had it.

So this is really the

And both because of that and

the change in philosophy between the 1968 and 1972 amendments,
we don't believe it should be decided here first.

QUESTION;

Before you move on to the merits, your

initial argument here is that we ought to dismiss this writ
as having been improvidently granted.

(Inaudible) changed,

and because it. is beyond the confines of this particular case
•>-

it has very little impact, if any.

But you are not making

the argument that this particular case is moot.
MR. FLEISCHER;
QUESTION:

That is a correct statement,

The rights of the parties still depends

on the decision of this case.
MR.' FLEISCHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

When you get to the merits, how many

counties are there similar to this in the country?
MR. FLEISCHER:

I simply can't say.

The record

doesn't disclose it, Mr. Justice Marshall, and it •—
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be important to find out how

many children are denied this benefit solely because they
happened to be in a county that's like this on©?
MR.

FLEISCHER:

Well, I don't believe, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that this plaintiff is denied solely because of
that reason.

Really, the reason that issue arises is because

of the prospective nature of the 1968 amendments.

Had the

adopted parents — had the .1968 amendments been law when this
adoption took place, there could have been qualifications.
Now, in passing the amendments in 1968, perhaps unfortunately
Congress did not. go back and try to pick up the prior adoption

24
But we would submit, that when it. was passed in 1968 it. was a
reasonable provision for the future, and the fact that it*,
didn't go back and pick up all the earlier cases did not make
it unconstitutional.

So I don't believe we. do have to know

how many counties there are in this circumstance.

But if it

were relevant, unfortunately the record does not disclose that
and I don't know the answer.
QUESTION:

You don’t know of any other actual cases

that depend on this?
MR. FLEISCHER:

No, fir. Justice White.

Counsel has

represented this morning that there is one other, and I don't
doubt that that may be so.
QUESTION:

Well,

can

I take judicial notice

that there are many counties in this country that don't have
child placement bureaus?
MR. FLEISCHER:

Well, even assuming that's so, that

doesn't mean that an out-of-county agency can’t supervise
the adoption.
QUESTION:
MR.

Well, suppose they don't?

FLEISCHER:

QUESTION:

Well, in the first place —

I guess the child should move to another

county.
MR.

FLEISCHER:

Well, I don't know that there is any

basis for the supposition in the first place.

And in the

second place, assuming that the number is small, the fact that

25
legislation does not cover every case to which its rationale
should apply, X don't believe is a basis for cons_ifcufcional
invalidation under such decisions of this Court as Jefferson v,
Hackney and McGowan,
Now, I believe both of the Petitioner's constitutional
arguments depend heavily on criticism of the congressional
determination that it ought to guard against adoptions for the
purpose of obtaining benefits.

I would like to give a practical

commonplace illustration of why this danger is inherent in
the situation of post disability adoptions.
Let's suppose, for example, both a grandparent and
an aunt and uncle of a child are considering adopting the
child.

Let's suppose that in the particular case the aunt and

uncle might be able to batter educate the child and provide
him a home with children his age and for other reasons might
be a more suitable horns.

Now, the grandparents are responsible

and upstanding citizens.

They may well pass the State adoption

test, and their petition might be granted.

But Congress

reasonably might not want this decision influenced by the
desire to get additional Social Security benefits.
So it is not only the case of the crass attempt. tG
use the child, which is protected against by the pi acement
agency case, but in addition situations such as I have
described.

And allowing benefits in the case of post disability

adoptions only where the court decreed the adoption and the

26

adoption was supervised by a placement agency, is a very
rational way of being sure that the motivation isn’t Social
Security benefits, but instead th® one specified by th©
State's adoption laws.
Now, that this is so is brought home by a decision
of the New Mexico Supreme Court which we cite at page 18 of
our brief called Gutierres.

This was a grandparent case, and

in that case it was only because the State welfare agency
pursued the case all the way up to the highest court of the
land that an adoption for the purpose of obtaining Social
Security benefits was stopped.
Now, of course, Petitioner can urge that the
congressional evidence in avoiding this kind of situation is
excessive.

There is really no way of knowing statistically

how often it occurs.

Or that Congress was too cautious and

bent over too far backward in having Social Security considera­
tions intrude into the adoption process.

But we would submit,

that those arguments ought to be directed to another branch of
government and they don’t show th« irrationality of th® test
Congress set up or its lack of relationship to the goals of
Congress.
Now, to be sure this classification may not be
perfect,.

This particular case may show that it isn’t.

There

would seem to be some difficulties, also, however, with what
appear to be the principal available alternatives, either

27

reducing the protection of both children and fch© public trust
or having Social Security Hearing Examiners try to decide
the subjective motivation of the adoptive parents on a caseby-casa basis.
Furthermore, an after-born natural child is not
situated identically to a post disability adoptee and hence
the distinction is proper.

First, the possibility of the

subordination of the child's interests aren't present in the
case of the natural born child.

And, second, in terras of

the wage earner — the loss of the wage earner's support* there
may be a difference.

In the case of a natural child later

conceived, it can't be assumed that the conception was based
on a decision which considered the ability to support the
child.

However, if there is a later adoption, we can assume

that the adopting court would not issue the decree if there
were not an ability to support the child.
I would close by saying that, we would consider the
attack on the child-placement supervision requirement as it
applies to the

particular situation in West Virginia due to

lack of the agency in some counties a little wide of the mark.
Again, it seems directed to showing that the Act created
an inequity in this individual situation which isn't sufficient
to invalidate the statute.
But moreover, the distinction flows from the fact
that Congress addressed the problem in 1368 in a prospective

28

fashion and didn't save the day for all prior 'adoptions.
QUESTION:

In this particular case, suppose they

moved to a county that did have a placement service and
qualified and then moved back to this county, what would
happen?
MR. FLEISCHER:

You mean, if the adoption in the

first place had been in a county where —
QUESTION:

They are living in a county where they

can't get it and they moved to a county where they can get
it and they do get it, then they moved back to the county
where they couldn't get it.
MR. FLEISCHER:

What happens?
I would think that if the adoption

is valid under State law that the move was not solely for
purposes of

time they could get it.

So they could get it by moving to

another county and -then moving right back.
MR. FLEISCHER:

Well, I am not certain, Mr.

Justice Marshall, that the adoption can now be undone and
reinstituted.

I did look this point up under West Virginia

law, and I simply can't ascertain whether that's possible.
However, one tiling is clear, and that is that West Virginia
does not like to revoke an adoption already granted.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Fleischer.

Do you have anything further?

You have two minutes,

Mr. McClelland.
MR. McCLELLAMD:

Well, your Honor, on the question

of adoptions and placements hers, there is no way that I could
give justice to that in two minutes, and all I can say is I
will thank you for your consideration.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
