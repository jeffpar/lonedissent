MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V. MEIERHENRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes to the Supreme Court from the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals which issued a court, decision
affirming Judge Nichol of the District of South Dakota.

The

facts in this case are basically that this crime was committed
upon an Indian reservation in the State of South Dakota, the
Crow Creek Indian Reservation, by one Indian against another
Indian*

The indictment was brought under 18 U.S,C. 1153«

There was a conviction had on this crime.
of the case the defense
instruction.

During the trial

requested a lesser-included offense

It was not given*

The Supreme Court on December 4 of year past granted
certiorari on the question of whether tlx® District Court’s
refusal to give that lesser-included offense instruction under
18 U.S.C. 1153 violated the Fifth Amendment due process
guarantee»
Now, the lesser-included offense instruction that.

4
was given was the crime of assault to the major crime of
assault with intent to do great bodily injury.
in this case has two basic contentions.

The defendant

Number one, that the

Act of 1885 intended that Indians be tried in the same manner
and in the same courts as other parsons committing the same
crimes.

And the second is that if the petitioner's contention

that this is incorrect, and Congress did not intend the
jurisdiction b© present, to convict under lesser-included
offense instructions, then 18 U.S.C. as applied violates due
*

process because a lesser-included offense instruction is part
of a fundamentally fair trial, and Rule 31(c) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure so direct.
Before I launch into the main argument, I would like
to point out a correction as I see it in the Government's
brief.

And that is argument 2, pages 19 to 23.

In the

petitioner's view, that is not the state of the law at the
present time.

They speak in their brief of a narrow class

of cases which would lead me to believe they think it's 13
major crimes.

This is not the state of the law in Indian

reservations in the United States.

The general laws of the

United States apply except — and 18 U.S.C. 1153 points this
out — if the crime is one Indian against another Indian, if
there has been punishment under tribal lav/, and, number three,
if the treaty rights control this particular point — and a
case cited in the Government's brief points this out, which

5

is the Menominee Tribe v. United States, which is a fishing
right, under treaties which continues,
An example of this is

a

case which is not. cited in

?

any brief, United States v. Burlin, 441 Fad, 2d, 1199, and
this Court, denied cert, in that case.

That was forgery.

And

what w© are talking about here, when I am talking about, the
general laws of the United States, is that, the Assimilative
Crimes Act. applies to Indians.

That case so held that involved

conviction out of Montana for forgery under the state statute.
An example of this right now is the occurrences which are in
the news at Wounded Knee.
some of these people.

I have read the indictments against

It is under the Assimilative Crimes Act

is for violations of postal regulations involving postal things
which the Wounded Knee Trading Post is also a post office.
So the Assimilative Crimes Act does apply.
Now, the important thing about that in this case is
under the Assimilative Crimes Act an Indian would get. a
leaser-included offense instruction.

Only when you are talking

about the 13 major crimes does he not get a lesser-included
offense instruction.

And, as the Government talks about this

clear pattern, within the 13 there is on® that there is a
lesser-included offense instruction included within, which is
larsenv.

And that would be the common thing of petty larseny,

larseny under $100, which .is included therein.
How, then, the jurisdictional part, as the Court is

6

aware, started with Crow Dog which in 1883 said that the
United States Government has no jurisdiction over crimes by
one Indian against, another Indian on an Indian reservation»
Out of that decision by the Supreme Court, the Act. of March 3,
1835, set up the jurisdictional scheme that we now have on
Indian reservations.

That said within a territory, which

South Dakota was at that time, within a territory, the laws
of the territory applied to all persons, Indian and white alike,
without any thought of an Indian reservation.

Therefor®,

between the dates 1885 and 1889 in the Territory of Dakota,
an Indian would get a lesser-included offense instruction.
Upon South Dakota becoming a state in 1889f Indians lost this
right because

the second part of th© Act of 1885 took effect

which said that within a state, if it happened within the
confines of an Indian reservation, Federal law applied, which
at that time there were seven major crimes defined by Federal
law.

There have since been six added all defined by state

law.

Nov/, within that four-year period, an Indian was given

lesser-included offense instruction.

In 1889 the present

scheme came up and ever since then all the courts have held —
and I am the first to admit that the case law on the
petitioner's side is miniscule — no court has allowed, without
being reversed, lesser-included offense instructions.
However, the petitioner would point out on page 10
of our brief that -the totality of two -statutes now recodified

7
must, be looked at,
QUESTION'S
main argument.

They are 18 U.S.C, 1153 and 18 U.S.C. 3242,
Mr, Meierhenry, let. me go back to your

You say that no court ever allowed it without

being reversed.

Does the Government occasionally ask for a

lesser-included offense instruction as well as the defendant?
MR* MEIERHENRY:

Yes, your Honor.

A close reading,—

in fact, the Government has cited a cas®, United States v*
Jacobs.

A close reading of that case reveals that, it was the

Government in that cas® that wished to have the lessorincluded offense instruction*

As I remember, it was rape and

carnal knowledge, or something of that matter.

But they have

in the past, yes.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Meierhenry, you are not attacking the

statute on constitutional grounds, are you?
MR, MEIERHENRYs

Your Honor, I am, yes.

The first

point, if the Court should find that I am incorrect and there
is no jurisdiction to give a lesser-included offense
instruction, then it is the petitioner'3 contention that
18 U.S.C, 1153 as applied, meaning not giving a lesserincluded offense instruction, violates due process.

So if the

Court should rule against me on point one, then I would contend
that it violates due process.
QUESTION?

I wonder why you don't attack it

constitutionally head on.

Wouldn't your client be better off

if you could knock the statute out?

8

MR, MEIERHENRY:

Yes, your Honor.

As far as the

trial in this case either way, if either point is correct, I
believe it would have to be remanded because there was no
lesser-included offense instruction given.
QUESTION?

But wouldn’t it be a violation of due

process only because it denies something akin to equal
protection?
MR. MEIERHENRYs

Yes, your Honor, on the due

process —
QUESTIONs

Otherwise, it's not a violation.

Isn't

it just that it treats some people different from others?
MR. MEIERHENRYs

Yes, your Honor, and as I'll point

out again, on the due process part, the Government citas a
very recent case.
QUESTION:

Would that be the basis for your due

process argument?
MR. MEIERHENRYs

My basis is that an Indian person,

being a United States citizen, is treated differently.
QUESTION:

Right,

It's Federal equal protection

through due process.
MR, MEIERHENRY:
QUESTION %

Yes, your Honor.

You don't claim any infirmity in the

statute other than if it is construed to preclude the lesser-"
included offense instruction?
MR. MEIERHENRYs

My view, your Honor, is that if this

9
Court agrees with m© on point one and said that there is
jurisdiction, and you read the statute, the original Act of
1835, saying that, when Congress wrote that saying Indians be
tried in the same manner and in the same courts, in effect,
like everyone else, if you agree on that point, w© may not.
ever get to 'the due process part of it in this particular case,
looking at this particular case.

It may come up later, but

the Court, could not decide that issue and still reverse and
remand this case.
Now, on the due process part, your Honors, what. I am
contending is that this is a racial classification the
Government

—

QUESTION!
.isn't, there?

There are two ways of assuring that,

One way is to say that fch© lesser-included

offense instruction is available in this case.

And the other

way is that it isn’t available in any case.
MR, MEXERHENRY!

That's true, your Honor,

As this

Court has held in Sansome v. United States, they talk about
it as an entitlement, and the Federal courts have always, or
?

for son® time, ruled that it is there not to give —
QUESTION:

That isn't equal protection, is it?

That's substantive.
MR. MEXERHENRYs

That would be substantive, your

Honor.
On the due process part, it's our

10

QUESTIONS

That would be substantive because of the

rule.
MR.MEIERHENRYs

Well, I say that there has been a

violation of du© process for two reasons.
QUESTIONi

.,. 31(c) under the Rules entitles him

to instruction anyway?
MR* MEIERHENRYz

Yes.

I have in ray brief, your

Honor
QUESTION:

And then if it's not to be, certainly

on its face it would appear to entitle you to it, wouldn't it?
And if you say it's not, for whatever reason, because he's an
Indian, then it would be unconstitutional.
MR* MEIERHENRYs

Because it's a racial classification.

And as the Government points out that the short answer to my
contention is that the clause of Section 3242 to which
petitioner points simply provides ordinary trial procedures
apply in Indian cases is exactly what we «ure contending here.
Rule 31(c) which is a statute says that all persons must be
given a lesser-»included offense instruction, but they are not
given one here.
Now, the Government points out, and w© would say
that the due process part of this is more akin to McLaughlin v.
Florida.

They point out in their brief, at page 23 they

cite the recent case of McGinnis v« Royster which was decided
by this Court on February 21, 1973,

They cite language in

IX
their brief.

But they don’t cite the start of the next,

paragraph which is the most important part of the case.

"When

classifications do not call for strict judicial certainty,
this is certainly the only approach consistent with proper
judicial regards to the judgments of the legislative branch."
My reading of this is that, this Court did not. feel
that this case, the facts which involved good time under
parole and pardons needed strict judicial scrutiny.

All the

cases, McLaughlin v. Florida, and the rest, talk about racial
classifications as having that very strict judicial scrutiny.
And so the cases that they have cited here are not on point.
This Court in Weber v. Aetna Casualty decided in 1972 suggested
a test, it is a suggested test that where you have personal
rights which we are contending that the right to a lesser-*
included offense in this case does is a personal right, there
is a dual inquiry:
promote?

What legitimate interest does classification

And what fundamental personal rights might the

classification involve or endanger?
Wow, the Eighth Circuit below in its court
opinion said that tribal sovereignty is the thing that must be
protected.

And X might point out at this time that this tribe,

Crow Creak Tribe, is not an Indian Reorganization Act tribe.
It operates under the Code of Indian Offenses which is found
in C.F.R. 11.1 and following.
tribal codes at all.

To my knowledge there are no

It’s all out ©f the Code of Federal

12
Regulations.

So at least to the Crow Creak Tribe where this

happened, the tribal sovereignty is questionable at least to
decide this case on that»
But the fundamental personal rights that are
endangered of Francis Keeble as an Indian person compared to
other Indian citizens tried in Federal courts, it is his
contention that he need not carry with him the tribe, but
tried as an individual in the courts of the United States.

He

should be tried as an individual, and h© should be given all
those protections.

Because if he is not given a lesser-

included offense instruction, Rule 31(c) is violated and that
statutory protection.
He also, as 0fConnor v. New Jersey pointed out, at
page 21 of our brief, he loses the right to have the jury
decide the degree of crime as well as whether the crime itself
was committed.

And this to me involves the province of the

jury, that the jury is lost one element of deciding, and they
are the judges of the facts.

However, they are ruled by just

those instructions given to them by the court,
But there is another thing that is probably more
important, and I found this in the trial of these type of
cases, is that the petitioner has lost the fact that he can
?

plea bargain.

Now, this Court in Santavelo v. New York said

that this is an essential component of the administration of
justice.

Now, he can certainly plea bargain in the sens© of

13

how many years and tilings like that, but. what about the
difference between a greater offense and a lesser offense?
This doesn’t come into.' play.

?h@ Government contends that

this is a fair and rational classification.

Yet three weeks

ago in a cas© that I tried, there were two major crimes
committed — larseny and burglary.

Because larseny is one

of the original seven crimes and it’s in the statute, he got,
this fellow got, a lesser-included offense instruction on
larseny, but h© didn't on burglary because they said there is
no jurisdiction.

Now, here are two felonies, same occurrence.

On one point he gets a lesser-included offense instruction for
which he was convicted, and on the other one he doesn't.
doasn’t get. a lesser-included offense instruction.

He

The

Government would argue that the United States of America never
intended for him to get one.

Yet, they have made very —

they have been very careful when they passed the Act back in
1885 to add that Indian persons were to be tried in the same
manner as all other persons.
Now, the Government further contends that this being
a fair and rational classification, is that only in effect
twelve crimes that an Indian may b© charged with should not get
lesser-»included offense instruction.

As I pointed out, the

Assimilative Crime Act which is in effect the state law
applied through the Federal Government, those apply on an
Indian reservation unless those three things that I have men* <

14

excludes, which is Indian against. Indian,which

is if he has been punished by the local lav/ of the tribe and
if there is a specific treaty regulation on this.
QUESTION:

In this case, which one of those three?

Was it Indian against Indian?
MR. MEIERHENRY:
QUESTION:

It was Indian against. Indian.

That's the only reason in this case **hat

what, you are telling us?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, the wording in 18 U.S, 1153,

Mr. Justice, is — they have changed it, and it. is Indian or
any other person.

So for this — if it had been a white man,

if the petitioner had been white, every other fact, the same,
he would have gotten a leaser-included offense instruction.

That's correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

In the Government's brief, reference is

made to the Federal statute having to do with assault, upon &

And the suggestion is that this is comparable and that there

available to

Do you have any comment about that?

MR, MEIERHENRY:

Yes, I do, your Honor.

Number one,

15
applying the facts of this case, there is a case on this where
o

the crime that they speak of is discussed.
United States, which is 372 F.2d 422.

It's Walks on Top v„

In that case the man

assaulted was an Indian? either Bureau of Indian Affairs or
special officer or something,

Ha was an Indian who was also

an officer of the United States,

He x^as assaulted.

He was

charged under the general law •— the Indian who assaulted the
police officer was charged under the general laws of the United
States? assault upon a Federal officer.

He was also given a

lesser-included offense instruction by the way.

But to point

out what they are getting at. is the Federal connection? I
assume.
Now? they are saying that., number one? there would be
no lesser-included offense.

Number one? we have to assume —

and they don’t make this clear — it wasn't on an Indian
reservation? or? of course? their example given is incorrect?
because then the Assimilative Crimes Act vjould apply.
But there the connection is this.
connection is that he is a Federal officer.

The Federal
In our case the

Federal connection is that it's territorial? it’s on land? and
that’s the connection.

So the examples they give is that i**'s

not always an all-or-nothing situation.

The Federal jurisdiction

hare we have to assume for their example? although they don't
make it. clear? that, it's off the reservation,

otherwise? he

would be given the leaser-included.offense instruction under

16

this very factual situation that, ha talks about, now.
And on the bank robbers, which is the other example
that, they put in their brief, again ws are assuming, and they
don't make this dear, that it’s not on an Indian reservation.
All they are saying is that all bank robbers are treated the
same.

In my case is involved a situation where an Indian

isn’t treated equally as all other persons.

If this were any

non-Indian, he would have been given a lesser-included offense
instruction in our factual situation.

In the case of bank

robbery, all bank robbers are treated equally.

And if there

is no jurisdiction for a lessor-included offense instruction,
then all persons no matter what race, are treated squally.

And

we must rememberI think, that Francis Keeble as an Indian
has no choice.

Celestine v. United States decided that, which

is cited, as I recall, on the last page of my brief.
he can’t, make an election.

At birth

He can’t say I now wish to be

tried as a whit© man and be a white man.

There are two cases,

One says the white man born white can never be Indian, and an
Indiam person of Indian descent can never be treated as a
whit©

man under these Acts.

He is treated unequally.

So there is no choice left open.

He is not given a lesser-includad

offense instruction.

would bound from one Federal jurisdiction, or one Federal
court into another because we have a CFR for it, which is
the judge is a Federal government employee, the police officer
a Federal government employee, the jail is Federal government,
the food they feed the prisoners is Federal government.

The

only way you can put an Indian in jail on the Crow Creek
Indian Reservation is if the Federal government decides to do
it, in effect, because all the arms are the Federal government's.
QUESTION;

What if the charge here had been attempted

MR, MEIERHENRY;

Attempted assault would not be

covered by the Major Crimes Act. and would therefore be a tribal
crime.

You've got. Reorganization Act. Indians,

you've got CFR Indians,, you've got just plain Indians, and
you've got these Major Crimes Act. Indians.
MR. MEIERHENRYs

And you've also got situations in

States where there is State jurisdiction as well.

There's a

number of them.
QUESTION:

But in this particular case, petitioner

was subject to what kind of a tribal court system?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Mr. Justice, it is a Court of

Indian Offenses, a Federally subsidized court.

The Tribal

Council, or the legislative body of the tribe has passed to
my knowledge no laws.

They use what the Secretary of the

Interior prescribed their laws to be.

If you will note in

the facts of this case, our man was brought in by a Federal
special agent, he was charged with Section 11.49 of the Code
of Federal Regulations for disturbing the peace, and was
placed — and there was a remand on this? this was another
part of the case — he was placed in jail on this Federal
misdemeanor charge until the FBI man could come out from
Sioux Falls, a hundred miles away, to investigate the felony
charge.

So therefore —

I forget what the coding system is -— we don’t refer to this.
But on Crow Creek you do, because they have not adopted these
laws.
QUESTIONs

And who are the judges?

MR. MEIERHENRY:

The judges are most commonly lay

persons hired by the Department of the Interior.

Once in a

while if the tribe is large and tlx© case load is large, a
professional attorney will be hired.
QUESTION:

in dispute here.

But if the Indian gets a better break, all

I have to do is say I’ve got a drop of Indian blood, then I
get that.
MR, STONE:
Justice Marshall.

Well, that's a complicated question, Mr.

You may conceivably, and I don’t think

there is any reason to get into this in this case.

You may

have to not only prove that you have a drop of Indian blood,
but more than that, and you might have to prove that you have
got the right kind of drop of blood and you’re a member of
this particular tribe that resides on this reservation.

But

I think that those questions are much at the periphery of this
particular inquiry which is quit© important to focus precisely
what it is.

As X say, this concept of Indian sovereignty is

limited to sorae extent within certain broad boundaries by
Congress’ power to redefine and narrow th© scope of Indian
■tribal sovereignty through the passage of legislation.
Nonetheless, the Court has consistently recognised
for hundreds of years that tribal sovereignty springs from

27
independent roots, that it retains a life in force of its own,
and that its residual effects can only be eliminated through
very specific Congressional action.

And it was on this basis

that the Court decided in Ex parte Crow Dog at 109 U.S. that
the Federal court had no jurisdiction absent a specific statute
over the murder of an Indian by another Indian on a reservation
because Congress had never withdrawn the exclusive jurisdiction
over such an offense from the sovereign tribe.

And then again

as recently as 1970 in the Kennerly case the Court very strictly
construed a Federal statute authorizing the tribes to cede
their civil jurisdiction over matters arising on the reservation,
and, in short, the Court has repeatedly emphasized that those
aspects of tribal sovereignty which Congress has not very
explicitly withdrawn are still in full force.
On the other hand, and this is where the particular
difficulty in this case arises, since 1924 all Indians, including
those residing on reservations subject to the jurisdiction of
the tribal government and tribal court, have been considered
United States citizens who enjoy the same privileges in life
conferred by that status which other United States citizens
enjoy.

The inherent conflict between these two elements of

Indian status is obvious enough to the extent that the tribal
Indian remains subject to the governmental authority of the
sovereign tribal group to which he belongs, he inevitably finds
that merely because ha is a tribal Indian, he enjoys«certain

28

privileges and incurs certain legal obligations which are not.
shared by other American citizens.
One example of this we have alluded to already in
this argument which seems to be crucially relevant to an
understanding of the particular discrepancy with respect to
which petitioner complains here is that the tribal Indian who
commits a crime against another Indian on the reservation is
punishable exclusively in the tribal court unless th© crime is
on© of those with respect to which Congress has specifically
delegated jurisdiction to the Federal or the State court, for
example, as in the Major Crimes Act.

Though Congress has

repeatedly found, as I shall discuss shortly, that the
preservation of th® tribal court system is of great benefit,
to reservation Indians, subjection to the tribal court’s
jurisdiction appears to have elements in some cases of both
comparative advantage and comparative at least theoretical
disadvantage to the tribal Indian, Aside, for example, from
the comfort which he may derive from being judged by his tribal
brothers in a proceeding that is meaningful arid familiar to
him and to his culture, the commentators appear agreed that he
is likely to receive a considerably smaller penalty if he is
convicted in a tribal court.

In this case, for example, the

penalty which the tribal court imposed for the actions leading
to the charge at issue her® was 15 days incarceration essentially
for public intoxication and a fine of $20.

29

On the other hand, the tribal court does not offer
the panoply of procedural rights and protection which a nonIndian citizen would enjoy if he were being tried for the same
offense in a State or Federal court.

Indeed, prior to 1963,

Congress imposed virtually no requirement whatsoever on the
tribal courts and with minor exceptions, the Federal courts
held that because of the continued concept of tribal sovereignty
this discrepancy did not offend the Constitution.
In 1968, as the Court knows, Congress passed the
Indian Bill of Rights which imposed on the tribal court at
least a skeletal version

the outlines of which have not yet

been adjudicated of the right enumerated in the first Ten
Amendments to the Constitution.

But that was presumably not

by constitution mandate but part of Congress’ decision to slowly
integrate the Indian tribal system into the concept of justice,
inherent in the rest of the country.

Indeed, the Indian Bill

of Rights, we would suggest, is representative of a pattern that
has been very wisely followed in the reconciliation of the
conflicting elements of Indian status.

A few Federal courts

of appeals in years immediately prior to the passage of that
Act had indicated some impatience at the slow movement of
tribal courts in the direction of affording traditional
constitutional protection of the criminal defendants and it has
been suggested in at least one case that a proceeding in a tribal
court might be reviewabla in the Federal courts on the ground

30

•chat, the tribal court was obligated to provide at least some
constitutional procedures.

It’s a rather awkward doctrine

for & court to b® applying because it applies piecemeal with
no ascertainable standard constitutional protections rather
than applying them across the board.

But it was recognized

even in that case that Congress is the appropriate body and
is in a less awkward and more appropriate position to determine
the details of the plan by which tribal justice can be
integrated into the American constitutional system in a manner
that preserves to.the extent. Congress deems desirable both
the sovereign rights of the tribal government and the rights
owed to Indians as citizens of the United states.
So Congress has repeatedly responded in all areas
related to this case not with a mechanical across-the-board
application of constitutional requirements on the tribal court
system, but with a set of requirements which the Congress
considers viable in terms of preserving the basic nature of
those courts.
Now, this case presents this Court with another
closely related aspect of the problem of reconciling the
status of Indians as citizens and their status as members of
a separate sovereignty.
QUESTION:

Before you get into that, Mr. Stone, I*m

having trouble, some problem with the record trying to
reconcile the charge with the statutes.

The statement of the

31

case recites at page 3 that the petitioner was found guilty
of assault with intent to inflict great bodily harm under
18 U.S. Code 1153.
Now, I turn to your brief, page 2, and 1153 describes
the crime as assault resulting in serious bodily injury.

So

the thrust of the one is intent and the thrust of the other
is consequence.
MR. STONE:

Yes.

This is certainly a problem, Mr.

Justice Burger, Mr. Chief Justice.
to it.

I don't have a full answer

It hasn't been raised before.

And it has been accepted

in this case and in other cases that this particular — these
two offenses are sufficiently related so that the Major Crimes
Act confers jurisdiction under South Dakota law to try for
assault with intent to commit the crime.

I have two answers

in litigation of the very obvious objection that there may be
an element required in the Major Crimes Act which is not
required under South Dakota law, to wit: the element of
actual serious bodily damage.

And that would b© the objection.

First of all, it is not at all fair that the offense
in South Dakota of assault with intent to inflict great bodily
harm is prosecuted in practice unless there is in fact great
bodily harm, and the other answer is to that in this case it
is entirely undisputed in the record and I do not believe
petitioner would dispute that the actual incident here resulted
in great bodily harm.

I doubt that the Federal Government

32

would have prosecuted had it not resulted in great bodily harm»
And I simply leave the theoretical possibility of a case in
which there was no great bodily harm but perhaps a proof that
there was intent unsuccessfully carried out to cause great
bodily harm as an open question.
QUESTION:

We do have a hiatus her© between the

statutory base, the allegation of the indictment.

You, of

course, concede that, don’t you?
MR. STONE:

I am sorry, I don’t understand, Mr.

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

The discrepancy here, the statutory

authority deals with assault resulting in great bodily harm.
MR, STONE:
QUESTION:

Right.
Serious bodily harm, and the indictment

was assault with intent,
MR. STONE:

That’s right, because that is how the

State statute is defined.

But as I say, it is not at all clear

that the State statute is ever applicable except where in
fact the harm resulted.

Indeed, it is interesting, it may work

just the other way, because there may well be great bodily
harm which would satisfy the wording of

18 U.S.C. 1X53 without

the requisite intent and simply intent to cause assault at
all might agruably b© sufficient to carry forward even if no
bodily harm were intended, but great bodily harm resulted.
But in the context of this case, I don’t think the

33

issue is raised, not only because it hasn't been raised below,
but because there was to everybody's total agreement not only
great bodily harm, but death, as a result of the series of
incidents that occurred.
QUESTION:

Death resulted, I understand, from over-

He lay out on the ground all night.

MR. STONE:

Well, that's disputed in the record.

But

at least it is undisputed that the victim walked out in pretty
terrible shape, Mr. Justice Douglas.
QUESTION:
MR. STONE:

Dead the next morning.
And died the next morning.

There is some

doubt whether he died of the injuries or. overexposure.

There

was testimony in the record that h© probably died of over­
exposure, but there was other testimony that he had been very,
very severely battered.

There was blood splattered all over

the room in which he had been — and I think no question that
the event of great bodily harm came.

And I think this question

that the Chief Justice quite aptly raised really ought, to be —
(a) I don't think it would arise because I doubt seriously
there would be a prosecution absent bodily harm, but if so,
I think that problem should await to a case in which the
objection is properly raised and no great bodily harm is
present.
QUESTION:

He was tried for assaulting with intent.

That’s what he was charged with, that's what he was tried for.

34

MR. STOWE:

That's right.

Which adds, incidentally,

an element that was not necessarily present in the Federal
crime.
QUESTION:
MR. STONE:

Oh, really?
The intent to cause great bodily harm

is not necessarily present in the Federal list in 18 U.S.C. 1153,
only the actual a&using.

Now, clearly sows type of intent

is necessary, intent to commit a battery at all.

But it isn’t

clear that 18 U.S.C. 1153 would ever require that there b©
intent of actual great harm.
QUESTION :

You mean you would have to show only

assault and a resulting bodily harm.
MR. STONE:

That's right.

Yes, assault which would

include some sort of intent to commit the assault, but not a
specific intent resulting in great bodily harm.
QUESTION:

I suppose an example of that would be if

someone simply slapped the face of another person and that
resulted in displacing or detaching a retina which is grave,
you would have that situation, wouldn't you?
MR. STONE:

You could have that situation.

.. grant, don't you think?

Particularly because it's a limited grant of certiorari?
MR.' STONE:

Well, yes.

Of course, that raises a

35

problem, Mr. Justice Relinquish, because the grant is worded in
terms of a constitutional question, and I suppose we can’t
argue that some preliminary threshold statutory question cannot,
be considered her©

that the Court need decide the constitutional

question absent some satisfactory determination of the
threshold questions that would set that up, for which reason
we have not objected, for example, to the statutory argument
that the lesser included offense charge is constructively
provided in 18 U.S.C. 1153 which petitioner raises.
QUESTION;

Mr. Stone, let's assume that what he

was indicted and tried for was something clearly not within
the reach of the Federal statute.
MR. STONE;

Then he clearly would not properly have

been tried in the Federal court at all.
QUESTION;

Don't you think we have to decide whether

this crime is within the range of the Federal statute?
MR. STONE:
QUESTION:
some

I think you do have to —
How can we put it aside and leave it for

other case?
MR. STONE:

I think you only have to leave it for

some other case where in fact the element of great bodily harm
is not present, Mr. Justice White.
I understand what the Court’s difficulty is inherently,
but I think it’s a speculative difficulty.

There is no

evidence that the Government would ever attempt or that South

MR. STONE?

Yes, it. was a jury trial,

What did the instructions say, Mr. Stone?

MR, STONE:

The instructions deal with the element

of intent and do not specifically require a finding —
QUESTION:

So how do you know, the jury may —

MR. STONE:

But that is because the sole defense

raised at the trial was with respect to the issue of intent,
and it was admitted throughout the trial that great bodily
harm had occurred.

It was never in question.

So therefore

it wasn't raised,
QUESTION:

But the Government had only to prove,

really, to bring itself within the statute an assault and
resulting bodily harm, and that in fact you shouldered the
burden of proving intent to inflict, and therefor© he got a
better break than he is entitled to under the statute.
MR. STONE:

We won't necessarily say he got a better

break, but that he was put to no advantage because th© Government
proved with no

possible —

QUESTION:

The only thing is, one element of the

crime was never submitted to the jury,
MR. STONE:

Well, I have no further answer to that,

Mr. Justice Whit®, except for th® fact that it would be — I

37

think a reading of this record and attention to both petitioner's
charge to himself, requested charge himself, and to the evidence
presented would reveal no conceivable question about that.
And I recognise the difficulty of assuming a directed verdict
type of assumption in the criminal context.

X think that the

presence of great bodily harm is as conclusively present and
undisputed in the context of this case as it could possibly be.
QUESTION :

I thought that your footnote 2 on page 4

dealt with this question.
MR. STONE:

*

Well, it deals with it by citation, Mr.

Justice Stewart, of the Nardelie case which implies that when
in a criminal context generally the Federal government
incorporates the State definition of a crime that it really
only incorporates the substantivo definition and not necessarily
the labels.
QUESTION;
MR. STONE:

Right.
I have soma question as to how far w®

can take that in this case to the extent that there really is
an underlying substantive definitional problem recited as I
recall as a “C” cite, and it is suggestive of a notion that
I think is hard to bring too far, except that in the context
of this case the element is so clearly present that we really
are, I think, only talking about —

MR. STONEs

I think that's right.

But I have some

White's suggestion that the element, there's no question about

Was it explained to the jury that he

wasn't charged with beating him to death, or even causing him
serious injury?
MR. STONEs

I don't think he charges — he doesn't

specifically say he was not charged with causing serious injury.
He says he is not charged with intent to kill.
QUESTION:

You are questioning there is no contention

by the Government the beating in question resulted in the
death of the victim?

In fact, there is no medical testimony

to the effect that death was the result of exposure.

But then

he is not charged with beating, only with intent to beat, to
beat with intent to inflict great bodily harm.
MR. STONEs

Well, I would submit with all deference

that I have no further response to that question except that
I think the difficulty which is raised her© might be a

39

difficulty in another case, but is rot a difficulty in this
case and ought not to deter this Court from reaching the
merits of the underlying issue that, is presented»
As I say, this case presents the Court with an
isolated aspect of the problem of reconciling the status of
Indians as citizens and as members of a separate sovereignty»
The problem arises because Congress has determined that a
tribal Indian who commits certain major crimes against another
Indian on a reservation is tried in the same manner subject to
the same penalties as a non-Indian committing the identical
offense, and yet on the other hand, Congress has determined
with respect to all other crimes not listed in the Major Crimes
Act a tribal Indian remains subject, exclusively to the
jurisdiction of the tribal court, even though admittedly his
non-Indian fellow citizen who commits the identical offense
in the same place goes to a very different procedure and is
subject to a very different law applicable in Federal court,
I take it the petitioner would not. deny the accuracy of this
description.

He has already confirmed it.

And he does not

appear to question the constitutionality of the overall
jurisdictional scheme even though it creates a significant
procedural and substantive discrepancy between tribal Indians
and other persons.

Indeed, the overall scheme has been

confirmed many times by this Court to lend credence to an
answer that mere categorization of an Indian in a Federal

40

statute is unconstitutional.,

Rather, he attacks one very

specific aspect of this discrepancy which results inevitably
from the Congressional allocation of jurisdiction between the
Federal and tribal courts in this area.

Simply stated, if an

Indian is on trial in Federal court for one of the offenses
enumerated in the Major Crimes Act, neither he nor the
Government is entitled to ask the Court for a lesser-included
offense charge even if otherwise appropriate unless the
lesser-included offense happens to be one of the other
offenses specifically enumerated in the Major Crimes Act
because the Federal court has no jurisdiction to try and punish
an Indian for commissions of any offense not specifically
enumerated in the Act.

With respect to a non-Indian in the

same situation, of course, it may be appropriate and probably
would have been appropriate here to instruct the jury if it
finds him innocent of the major offense charge, it may still
find him guilty of a lesser “-included offense.
Now, there are essentially two arguments raised.
One, petitioner argues that alternatively the Major Crimes Act
itself allows the lesser-included offense charge.

I think

y

With my time running short, I shall leave that statutory
argument essentially to the brief in Which we answer it fully.
Basically, it seems to me it's somewhat unusual for the
Government to be in the position of arguing a strict construction
in non-presence of a Federal crime against a criminal defendant

41
who argues that something is a Federal crime, but we have, I
\

think* tried our best to bind ourselves by the very strict,
rule of statutory construction applicable in criminal context,
generally that crimes ought not to be construed and that a
Federal crime should not be read by implication into & very
specifically worded statute.
I think that presumption applies with double force
in this context where Congress has specifically and repeatedly
said that, jurisdiction of the tribal sovereignty can only be
eliminated by very specific Congressional mandate* and

indeed

Congress has tip-toed step by step by step in amending the
Major Crimes Act to include offensas on a vary carefully
considered basis, and it would be highly contrary to the
history of that Act and its amendments to conclude that, any
crime is created by mere implication.

So with the Court's

permission —

Congress during that consideration of those statutes?

The

Assimilative Crimes Statutes.
MR. STONE:

Well, I assume that those s^a^u^es were

enacted with regard to the question of what jurisdiction
should be left in what places, and to the

extent that they

involved Indians, they involved consideration of what crimes
should be left to the Indian courts, and the essential
conclusion was, as reflected in the statutory scheme, that,
what should be left to the tribal courts are crimes between
Indians by and against Indians committed on reservations with
the exception of certain major crimes with respect to which
Congress felt —
QUESTION:
major -

That's what I am talking about, the

43
MR. STONEs

That’s right.

— with respect, to which

Congress felt that the crimes were so major that, the interest
in severe enough punishment — the assurance of severe
punishment of those major crimes was sufficient, to withdraw
jurisdiction or to withdraw exclusive jurisdiction from
tribal courts for any of those offenses.

But with respect to

all other crimes# it is quite clear from the history of the
Act that. Congress very much intended that# for the same reasons
they have always left, these to the tribal courts# they would
be left at this point to the tribal courts.
Therefore, in suggesting that this issue should be
considered in the

context of the entire statutory scheme

by which Congress has attempted to reconcile the conflicting
elements of tribal Indian status# a scheme which quite
explicitly results in some situations in disparate legal
treatment of persons merely on the ground that, they are not
Indians# we think that the rationale is that of the entire
scheme essentially governing the tribal court system and the
allocation of jurisdiction.

This is one minor example of it#

but the entire scheme is preservation of the sovereignty of
tribal courts# at least with respect, to offenses not enumerated
in the Major Crimes Act between and against# by and against
Indians committed on reservations.

And Congress has included

in its passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968# the
Indian Bill of Rights of 1968, Congress has studied carefully

44
this question and has concluded that, the preservation of the
tribal court system is essentially of great benefit to Indians,
that, field studies and commentators have shown that many
Indians feel they get a more fair and more equitable treatment.
Even though they don't get. the full panoply of Federal
procedures and constitutional safeguards, they feel that the
penalties are more lenient, that the justice is more in harmony
with their cultural concept of justice.

It is essentially based

on a notion of restitution rather than on retribution, and —
QUESTION:

This argument, Mr. Stone, really that you

can’t, ever get equal protection through due process, violation MR. STONEs

No, Mr. Justice Brennan, I don’t think

we have to go nearly that far, and I think it all —
QUESTION:
MR. STONE:

How far will you go, then?
Well, in this case I would go, I think,

not very far at all because I think the discrepancy between
which we deal with here, which is that a lesser-included
offense charge is available to a non-Indian defendant in this
. .j

case but not to an Indian defendant, is a very minor price to
pay for upholding the very major rationale that Congress
has consistently reinforced preserving tribal sovereignty
for a number of reasons.

(a)

It is in any context very

speculative from the defendant’s point of view whether a lesserincluded offense charge is beneficial to him.

Theoretically

it’s only of benefit if the jury doesn't follow its instructions

45

And it. may be perfectly proper for the jury to administer
mercy in some sorts of situations* particularly where the
evidence is marginal which we don’t think it was in this case.
The evidence was overwhelming that the requisite intent and
the requisite amount of damage occurred.

But it is in any

event a rather speculative benefit from the defendant’s point
of view anyway.

The lesser-included offense charge arose

because the prosecutor might, be barred by double jeopardy from
bringing lesser-included, entirely included offenses in
successive prosecutions.

And it was to enable him to put the

lesser-“included offense before the jury so that there would b©
some sort of conviction if the jury acquitted of major offense.
Now, we don't argue that it's not available and that
in some cases it would be reversible error to deny it to a
criminal litigant.

But the question is in a constitutional

context of an equal protection argument, we must ask how
important is it.

And I think it is a very speculative interest,
?

particularly in this context where, as Judge Kaufman suggested
in the Second Circuit in a related case involving a split
between adult

and juvenile jurisdiction where a lesser-included

offense charge was not available to a juvenile who could be
convicted of murder in an adult court but of manslaughter only
in a juvenile proceeding.

Judge Kaufman suggested something

that would have been perfectly applicable here that wasn't
asked for, and that, could be the functional equivalent of a

46

lesser-included offense charge, and that is a charge to •'■he
effect that even if you, the jury, in this Federal proceeding
acquit tills Indian of the charge which is brought against,
him here, he is not necessarily going to go free from ■‘“he
occurrences

in this transaction.

He can be tried — there

is another tribunal which can try him for any lesssr-incXuded
offense or other —

MR. STONE:

Excuse me?
Don't we have that issue in some case?

certiorari has been denied.

And in the case that it was

It was an

alternative issue.

MR. STONE;

That —
Does that compensate for Body?
I don't think so, Mr, Justice Brennan,

Those distinctions have not been thought applicable to CFR,and
other aspects of Federal participation or assistance to Indian
justice have not been thought to remove the underlying sovereign
right with which Indian justice is administered.

How do you get around the individual

answering it for the greatest good for the greatest number,
we forget it.
MR. STONE;

I answer it as I would in any context,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that discrimination is only unconstitutional
insofar as it is invidious and irrational.

It is not invidious

if it is based, on a rational basis.
QUESTION:

Is it based on anything other than the

fact that this man, the petitioner in this case, is it based
■on anything other than the fact that he is an Indian, spelled

MR. STONE;

Absolutely not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

MR. STONEs

We are only talking about, this one case.
I don't, think you can do that, fir.

Justice Marshall, with all respect.

I think you

This is the

situation, I think, in every case where the equal protection
argument is raised.
I would like to get back for one second to Mr.
Justice Brennan's question and say why I don't think the issue
of double jeopardy, where tills Court has to necessarily decide
that for all purposes Indian and Federal jurisdiction are
separate sovereignties, though indeed w® believe they are.
Because in the context of this case, that question is really
only important to the issue whether it is true that if
acquitted on the major charge in this case, this defendant
could be then retried on a leaser-included charge in the tribal
court.

And I would argue that even if they are not separate

sovereignties for all purposes, with respect to that question
the answer would b® that double jeopardy is inapplicable
because that particular branch of th® double jeopardy clause

49-50

as opposed, say, from the collateral estoppel problem or from
the problem of double punishment or two convictions for the
same offense, is based on the assumption that a prosecutor
ought, not to be allowed to go down the line in piecemeal
harrassing fashion.

And it is designed to prevent him from

abusing his discretion to go down the line and continue to
try to punish for each successive crime.

And that's

inapplicable here because he has no jurisdiction to go down the
line.
QUESTIONS

If on© believes the same transaction

rather than the same offense test, he might reach a different
conclusion.
MR, STONEs

Conceivably, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

... same transaction test as you know.

MR. STONEs

That would b© — in that case I must

rely on the argument of separate sovereignty.
In conclusion, I would simply reiterate that this
case must be viewed, I think, as one isolated and not terribly
significant aspect of discrepancies which inevitably arise
from this very, very complex effort to accommodate the
conflicting and different elements of Indian status that
th© result of declaring this particular discrepancy unconstitu­
tional would be very short-sighted and unwise from this
Court's point of view.

At th© very least, it would force upon

Congress discords of judgment that a rational© which has been

51
repeatedly upheld by the Federal courts and repeatedly
considered, studied, and re-endorsed by Congress to preserve
the sovereignty of Indian tribal courts where Congress deems
it applicable is insufficient to offset a discrepancy x^ith
respect to what is really a very speculative disadvantage that
an Indian may, a particular Indian in a particular case, may
with hindsight think he has suffered.

And I would recommend

that the Court affirm this decision.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V, MEIERHENRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MEIERHENRY:

It is unfortunate that the

petitioner has taken the case this far and the United States
Government has still not gotten all of its forces together and
decided between what's going on in Washington and what's going
on in South Dakota.

There is no such thing as a tribal

If a man of Indian descent is born and raised in

Washington, D, C., at age 28 goes on a vacation to the Black
Hills, passes through the reservation, commits one of the 13
major crimes, he will not be given a lesser-included offense
instruction.

Wall, on© of the 12 major crimes becaxise if he

steals something and it's larseny, he will.

Now, that's a

rational classification according to the Government.

The

52
Government; says, "Don't anyone step in here because this has
all been thought out."
Yet, the particular crime I have got up here,
Congress forgot to even amend 3242 which they did the other
12 times.

I submit that Congress has gone at this since 1885

in a happenstance manner.

They have never once, as this

Court knows, had this issue brought to them.

They have added

crimes one at a time, but they have never considered this as
a whole.
Now, another thing that the Government brings up is
let’s be strict about this.

The facts, and I will say that

I did not raise the issue about the discrepancy of the
statutory language in the Major Crimes Act and what h© was
charged with

in the indictment.

I did raise that, and at

this point I don’t think I could possibly do so*

But I will

tell you why the Government uses that statute.
South Dakota has a statute in the assault section
about four after thi3 one that is almost exactly like the
Federal one.

It is called assault by beating, wounding, and

The reason they don't us© it is because it has got

a 6-months penalty and they want five years, and that's why
they don’t use it.

If Rule 31(c) says that a

man should get a lesser-included offense instruction, this
Court seems to say he does, then this Indian should as well.
QUESTION:

What would have been the penalty on the

lesser-included offense?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, there are a number of them.

Attempted manslaughter in Federal law, six months.

Assault

QUESTION:

That's six months.

MR, MEIERHENRY:

There are a number of them,, your

Honor, that can be brought in under the assault.
QUESTION:

If the instruction you ask was to be

instructed on a crime that really was the only crime that
should have been tried under the Major Crimes Act, you really
are making the same argument on a lesser-included offense as

you would have been, if you said dismiss the indictment, it

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Yes, your Honor.

I would also point out that I have argued that, that
the casas that the Government has cited since then by
District Courts in our District have used those, additionally
the fact that X could ask

a

separate sovereign, that I could

ask for an instruction to the jury that would say in effect,
"If you don’t convict him, he can go back to tribal court."

said that’s no different than a prosecutor arguing to the
jury, "Convict this man and 1*11 recommend that h® get parole."
Both judges consider that to be improper argument.

X as an

It’s no different

than me arguing to the jury in State court saying, "All right,
in south Dakota, acquit him here because ha faces more serious
charges in Nebraska."
QUESTIONS

I don't think that’s proper.
Who was the trial judge here, Chief

Judge Nichol?
MR. MEIERHENRYs

Yes, Chief Judge Nichol from Sioux

Falls, South Dakota, ycur Honor.
And on this matter his view was strictly jurisdictional.
In our circuit, I don't know if it’s proper to express this,
but I am sure — and the Government, as a matter of fact, in
their brief says, "Don't give us tills power because we may

55
abuse it.”

But the petitioner and defense lawyers in our

State wish very much that they have because this gives us more
latitude.

We feel now that

Later they

So there

There is no danger, in my opinion, if the

grand jury system works and a defense lawyer doesn't know what
goes on there, that there be that thing of a prosecutor
doubling up, charging a greater crime, hoping to get a
conviction on the minor.

Because most misdemeanors are, you

know, a six-months variety, and the tribal court has that
jurisdiction, or CFR does in this case.
Your Honor, we would ask, the petitioner requests
that the writ of certiorari be issued and this case be heard.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Meierhenry, you were

not appointed by the Court in the conventional way here, but
representing your legal services in South Dakota you volunteered.
MR. PtEIERHENRY:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

And on behalf of the Court,

I want to thank you for your assistance to the Court and, of
course, your assistance to your client,
MR. MEIERHENRY;

Your Honor, I also thank you for

letting me appear since I don’t qualify as a member of the
Supreme Court Bar.
