ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS KEISTER GREER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GREER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of California.
Like the case which the Court has just heard, this
also involves the
district,

question of the franchise in a water

Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District compre­

hends approximately 193»000 acres, almost entirely in Kings
County, California in the SouthernSan Joaquin Valley.
There are nine water storage districts in Californi
There is no magic in the word "storage" in the title.

It

functions like an ordinary water — or an ordinary irrigation
district.

The thing which sets a water storage district

apart and the reason that these Appellants are here today
are two California statutes governing the suffrage in a
water storage district.
The first is section Ml,000 of the Water Code.
is very short and clear and to the point:

It

"Only the holders

cf title to land are entitled to vote at a general election, 12

4
and the statute immediately following.,Section 41,001, "Each
voter may vote in each precinct in which any of the land owned
by him is situated and may cast one vote for each $100 or
fraction thereof worth of land."
The Appellants — Plaintiffs below —■ include a
large landowner.

The Salyer Land Company farms approximately

28,000 acres of land in the district and about another
28,000 immediately outside it.
It includes a small landowner;

Harold Shawl has

one-half interest in 65 acres in the district.
It includes a non-landowning resident, Lawrence
Ellison, who, some 60--some years old, has resided, has worked
in the district.

It is stipulated in the record that he is

actively Interested in water matters.

He subscribes to

water publications —- interested in water, as is any normal
human being in this part of California — can't vote.
Q

What is the high and the lo\? of these two

small voters that you mentioned.
MR. GREER*.

The J. G. BOswell Company, Mr. Chief

Justice, owns 6l,000 acres in the district.

I think it

leases an additional 8,000 or 10,000 acres.

It farms

approximately 40 percent of the district and has about
40 percent of its water.
There are some land holdings that are down to less
than 20 acres.

I think there are 189 landowners in the

district who own about 2.3^ percent of the acreage.

They

own up to 80 acres apiece, so there is a pattern of a good
many small landowners and four large landowners, one of
which is the Appellant, Salyer Land Company.
Q

What about the J. G. Boswell Company?

What

do they get in votes?
MR, GREER:
37,825 votes.

The J. G. Boswell Company gets

There is an exhibit in the record, the voting

list of the last election which was hold in the district,
the only election which has been held in the district in
25 years, a special election called, in part, by my client,
and that voting list is the source of that information,
37,825 votes, for that one company.
Noxtf, these Appellants attacked these statutes in
the court below and they were both sustained.
sustained each statute.

The majority

Circuit Judge Browning concurred

in the exclusion of residents.

He didn’t think there was

enough governmental impact to justify giving the ballot to
residents.

But he dissented on the waiting of the franchise.
Circuit Judge Browning wrote a lengthy opinion.

He

couldn’t go along with the notion of granting one vote for
each $100.
Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, to gain
a notion of what this country looks like, there is an aerial
photograph which Is exiiib.it one following page 66 in the

6
Appendix.
This district is divided into 11 divisions which
brings up what is to me one of the most interesting facets
of the case in its present posture.
represented by a director.

Each division is

These directors are supposed to

be chosen at these bi-annual elections which aren't held.
Now, the Plaintiffs below, when they filed their
suit — the complaint as set forth in the Appendix — also
attacked the manner in which the divisions had been created.
The manner, I should say, in which they had been maintained,
because the assessed

valuation in one of the divisions was

as low as $600,000 and the assessed valuation of one of my
clients, Red Salyer, was $2 million and we said that among
the other things we said, we said that at any rate, there
ought to be some equity in the way that these are set up
according to assessed valuation and we got a unanimous
ruling of the court below on that.

All three judges said

that these divisions would have to be redrawn so that they
represented the same number of dollars.
The decision may be considered unique to that
extent.

It would seem to enunciate a doctrine which I might

call "One dollar, one vote."
Q

Now —

That issue is not here?

MR. GREER:

No, sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The district, while insisting in the court below,

7
vigorously insisted that it wasn't a governmental unit, and
while continuing to insist that in the briefs before this
court, did not file a cross appeal.
Now, I don't mean to belabor the point but the
court below relied on the Equal Protection Clause and said
that those unequal divisions didn’t consist of equal
protection.

It had to find •— it was a necessary predicate

of the decision that the district had to be a governmental
unit for it to invoke the Equal Protection Clause, as in the
other decisions of this court involving a disparity in size
of districts, like the Hadley case or the first case in
which this court met the local governmental issue, the Avery
case, Midland County, Texas and we think that since the
court did rule that way and since there has been no appeal,
that the issue of the governmental nature of this district.
I can — I can establish it to you without this
but we respectfully submit that it may be the law of the
case.
Q

Well, isn't your opponent free to sustain

the judgment below on any ground he wants to, even if it
was rejected in the lower court?
MR. GREER:

I think my point, Mr. Justice White, is

that the court below had to say that this was a governmental
district ~~Q

But he says it isn’t.

His position was

8
rejected below.
MR. GREER:

To that extent, yes, sir.

Q

But can't he sustain?

Yes.

MR. GREER:

I wouldn't want to foreclose him from

any argument he might wish to make.

I just say that it

occurs to me that the governmental nature of the district
below may have been adjudicated without appeal.
Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, there
are 77 residents.

Unless they be landowners, they can't

vote.
I mentioned Lawrence Ellison.
bit about the landowners.

I have said a little

There are 307 of them altogether.

I have mentioned that there are 11 divisions.

Six of those

II divisions are controlled by the J. G. Boswell Company,
with those 37,825 votes.

Two of the divisions are controlled

by the Appellants, Salyer Land Company.

Two are controlled

by another corporation, Westlake Farms and one by South Lake
Farms.
Now, the rigidy of that control is made very
express in this record.

The President in the district,

the president in 196? — president, I guess, 25 years.

He is

still president today — Mr. Louis T. Robinson, told the
California District Securities Commission in 1967, "I know
you shouldn't forecast elections, and that causes me a little
hesitancy to say what I am going to say."

9
"The 11 divisions in this large farming operation
are completely controlled.

You are going to have the same

11 directors on Tuesday that you have got today, with one
exeception, one of the directors is having some health
trouble and he is going to be replaced, but other than that
they are going to be the same 11 directors,"

and he

continued, he said, "Well, I have no concern about the
election.

Suddenly, if a nex-f board of directors x;ould come

in, why, then I would have nothing but opinion.
no concern about the election.

But I have

The 11 divisions are

controlled by people with enough votes to put back the same
directors they have now, including the two Salyers who are
dissenting at this time, the other nine will be returned."
Nov;, what Hr. Robinson says about an election
requires some explanation and I ought to say, in response to
a question asked by Mr. Justice Marshall in the preceding
argument that the California Water Code provides that these
elections shall be conducted in ail respects as are elections
governed by the Elections Code.

That is Section 41367 of the

Water Code.

These were supposed to be bona fide public elecbooth
tions with a curtain and a secret ballot and a polling/and

everything else and the legislature intended that there x^ould
be one every other year.

Section 41300 of the Water Code

says, "An election, knoxm as the general water storage district
election, shall be held in each district on the first Tuesday

10

in February in each odd-numbered year at which a successor
shall be chosen to each officer whose term expires in March
next thereafter."
Mr. Chief Justice, the last election, the last
general election in this district was in 19*47»
Q

Isn't there a state law that takes care of

that?
MR. GREER:

Well, there is a provision that 15

percent of the landowners can call a special election.

That

is the election which we called in 1967.
Q

Did Salyer have that 15 percent?

MR. GREER:
15.9 percent.

No, well, I beg your pardon, yes, just

But we were joined in —* a lot of the people

out there joined with us,

Westlake Farms I think joined with

us and that is the only election and this is made manifest in
the record — that is the only election which has taken place
since 19*17.

There is no motive for an election.

have already been counted.
Q

The votes

An election is

Are you telling U3 that that is the reason

the vote has been held or that anyone knowing all the facts
will know the outcome of the election?
MR. GREER:
true.

I suspect, Mr. Chief Justice, that is

I read my good friend and learned opponent's brief in

this case and he said — in defending the system he said, and
I am quoting from him on page 27, "One good test," he said,

II
"of an electoral system is whether it works in actual
operation."

And the way this one works in actual operation

is there hasn’t been a general election for a quarter of a
century."

MR. GREER:

12
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may resume,

Mr. Burgess — Mr. Greer, excuse me.
MR. GREER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This case and the case which the Court just heard
deal with special districts

and the view of these

Appellants is that in determining whether or not the voting
rights cases should apply to a special district, the crucial
question is, with what is the district concerned?
Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District Is
concerned with water and the control of the water in an
agricultural area is the control of everything.

I seem to

recall that the ancient Greeks spoke of the four basic
elements of, among others, earth, water and fire.

This one

Is water.
Now, there are a myriad of special districts in
California, I suppose In most states.

For example,

California has mosquito abatement districts.

We wouldn’t

have brought this case here from California to determine
the questions of franchise in a mosquito abatement district.
But to show the enormous impact of this district, the enor­
mous governmental impact, consider first at the very
beginning, Section *13158 of the California Water Code.
Now, a question was asked in the preceding

13
arguments does this district — the district then involved -acquire any rights just by the virtue of being formed?
This one doss and I quote the statute: "All waters
and water rights belonging to this state within the district
are given, dedicated and set apart for the uses and purposes
of the district."
Q

The —

What specific water rights would belong to

the state in a district such as this so they would come
within that definition?
MR. GREER:

There would probably be a number of

filings so the director of finance on the four streams going
into Tulare Lake, the Kings, the Kern, the Tule and the
"j

Kawesii Rivers, some of them might be in court, a number of
them might be vested rights.

There would be a large number

of potential prescriptive, appropriative and riparian rights.
Q

And the state in effect says that the

district takes over for the state in that instance?
MR. GREER:

Yes, the language is "given, dedicated

and set apart for the uses of

the district."

Now, the Attorney General of California was asked
in 1969 what the nature was of this particular district.
The district had had a major flood and was getting ready to
apply for some federal funds and it requested an official
Attorney General opinion to submit to the Federal Government
on the nature of the district.

14
The opinion of the California Attorney General is
set forth on pages 17 and 18 of the Appendix and it is
referred to again on page 6l and the crucial part is this,,
"This is an answer to your request for an opinion, for our
opiniona on the status of the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District as a political subdivision of the State of
California.

I have concluded that water storage districts

are considered political subdivisions of the state."
The Attorney General cited the leading case,
Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District against Ohrt

31 California

Appellate 2d 619, and that case contains a very explicit
statement of the governmental nature of these districts and
also sets forth a very clear distinction between this district
and the kind of district that was Involved in the case which
the court just heard.
As I read the decision of the Wyoming Supreme
Court In the Toltec case., the case went off only on the
proprietary nature of the district.
"proprietary."

The court used the term

It said that that was a proprietary-type

district.
The Glenn-Colusa case, cited, as I say, by the
Attorney General of California and the leading case, says
this, "State agencies, such as irrigation districts or
reclamation districts, are agencies of the state whose
functions are considered exclusively governmental.

Their

15
property is state-owned, held only for governmental purposes.
They own no land in the proprietary sense."
Now, this district has the problem in domain.
has it and it exercises it.
land in the district.

It

Its assessments are liens on all

It is covered by the special statutes

in California governing the immunity of governmental
agencies.

There is a special system in California whereby a

governmental agency can validate its actions and file a suit
to validate a contract or to validate anything else it does,
get an interim judgment against the world and when it is final,
its transactions can never be questioned, a very useful
procedure and one that is a great deal used.
This district has the privilege of using that
procedure, Section 860 on the following sections of the
California Code of Civil Procedure.
This district in a law suit filed in Federal Court
in Fresno, the same court that we are here today from, the
Eastern District of California, intervened parens patriae
in a case which was brought on the issue of acreage
limitations and said that it had the right to appear parens
patriae in behalf of the entire Tulare Lake Basin.
We submit that if there is anything which is of a
governmental nature, it is appearing parens patriae.
Mr. Justice Douglas, in the case of George against
Pennsylvania Railroad back in 19^5 quoted Mr. Justice Holmes

16
in the case of George against Tennessee Copper Company as
saying that that was quasi-sovereign.

This district, on its

application to the Federal Government, in closing that opinion
from the Attorney General, got $23^,000 in federal funds.
We are told in the briefs of these gentlemen
opposing us and the Amici Curiae have insisted on this, that
all the bills are paid by the landowners.
The landowners didn't pay that bill.

The —■ every

citizen in that district had an equal interest in that
federal money, $23^,000 and the residents, nevertheless,
were denied the right to vote.
Q

Well, counsel in the last case observed that

Lockheed has gotten a lot of federal money,

too, and pre­

sumably that didn't give the right of every resident in the
Lockheed area to vote in the Lockheed board of directors.
Are you saying that receipt of federal money is a determina­
tive in this case?
MR. GREER:

No, I say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

it Indicates the governmental nature of the

district and it

also refutes the notion that all the financing comes
the landowners.
Q

from

That is all I say.
Well, but the Federal Government does give

out money on occasion or loan money to nongovernmental
entities, doesn’t it?
MR, GREER:

Well, in this particular instance the

17
statute under which it proceeded was a

statute limiting

grants to governmental agencies for road repair, dam repair
and that sort of thing following a disaster.

This was under

the Office of Emergency Preparedness for relief of
governmental agencies which had suffered disasters.
Now, the power of thi3 district that I think is the
most important is flood control.

The gentleman opposing me

and the Amici have said, well, this district concerns
property.

It doesn’t concern people at all.

serve property.

They exist to

It doesn't do anything of interest to people

and one of the briefs said none of the residents are
interested in or affected by anything that this district
does.
Second, the -— this matter of flood control
jurisdiction is the immediate reason why the Appellant,
Salyer Land Company, determined to attack the weighted
voting system and I would like to speak very briefly about
the legal history of flood control in water storage districts.
The Act was passed in 1921.
policy are in Section 58 of the Act,
91** at page 1766.

The declarations of
Staats 1921 chapter

The expression, "the prevention of floods"

is found twice in the paragraph and is spoken of as a purpose
necessary to the accomplishment of a purpose that is
indispensable to the public interest..
Now,the Water Storage District Lav/ was codified in

18
19513 placed In the Water Code and those declarations of
policy were

omitted as superfluous but flood control is

still specifically referred to in Section 44001 in telling
the purposes for which the district may operate, that they
cooperate in contract with other districts in the State of
California, with the Federal Government.

It says, "For the

following purposes, construction, acquisition, purchase,
extension, operational maintenance of works for irrigation,
drainage, storage, flood control.51
The leading case in California on water storage
districts is Tarpey against McClure.
in 1921.

The statute was passed

A suit was immediately filed to try to get the

legislation declared invalid.

The California Supreme Court

In Tarpey — which was decided two years later, in !23 —
held that the Act was valid.
One of the reasons urged for its invalidity was
that contrary to the California Constitution, it embraced
more than one subject.

In the California Supreme Court which

deals with water all the time, we are told that It has
decided over 3,000 cases dealing with water law, said this —
well, what they said was, they said that flood control and
irrigation are two sides of the same coin.
that is all one subject.
is as follows:

They said that

The actual language of the court

"The conservation of water by means of flood

control works to restrain flood waters which otherwise would

19
overflow the land and go to waste and incident thereto the
reclaiming of the lands which otherwise would be overflowed
and rendered useless, the storage and distribution of such
water for purposes of irrigation, all seems to us to be
so legitimately and intimately connected one with another as
not to constitute different subjects within the purview of the
Constitution.

It may be said that in these respects, the

Act has but a single object, to wit, the better control and
utilization of water."
Now, this district has throughout its career until
one time carried out extensive flood control jurisdiction.
Exhibit five is a 1953 report from the president of
the district that goes on for 20 or 30 pages on all the floodcontrol things that it has done and I have excerpted and
printed in a printed trial brief filed below, all the matters
that pertain to flood control.

They are not in the Appendix

but they are in a readily accessible form should the Court
wish to see it.
Finally, my learned friend, opposing counsel,
Mr. Newell, stated in his trial brief — a printed trial
brief filed in the court below — that this district he
represents is "An agency authorized by the law of California
to engage in the reclamation of water through flood protection
drainage and irrigation works," and I therefore take it that
the flood control jurisdiction of this district is no longer

20
a matter that is open to question.
That bring;s me to the major floods of the last
20 years which led to this litigation.
Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District occupies a
dry lake bed.

It is dry in normal years.

There are dams on

all four of the streams s the Kings, the Kern, the Tule and
the Kaweah but in an extraordinary year, in a flood year,
water comes into the district.

Water overflows this rich

farm land and in 1906, 1917, 1938, — 1937-1936, 1952 and
1969, some or greater portions of the district were flooded.
1906 was a legendary year and so was 1969.

88,000 acres of

the district’s land was flooded in 1969.
Well, now, they can tell when it is going to be a
flood year.

You can see the

snow packed up in the mountains

and the engineers say that the water content is very high
and the snow pack is much heavier than usual.

We are* going to

have a flood.
Buena Vista Lake has a capacity of 235,000 acre
feet.

It is in Kern County on the Kern River south of Tulare

Lake.

The relation between them is shown on exhibit four

which is printed in the Appendix.

Always, when it is evident

that there is going to be a flood on the Kern River, the
people at Tulare Lake and the people in this district have
notified the governing powers at Buena Vista Lake, "Take
your flood water before you turn it down on us."

The record

21
is clearly made on that in the Appendix.

There is an excerpt

from the minutes showing that in 1952 —
Q

What page is this on?

MR. GREER:

Oh, in the beginning of page '41,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Thank you.

MR. GREER:

There is a reference to consulting

engineer Harding, who was a professor, a very eminent
professor and his eminence is

stipulated to in the record,

a leading authority on water matters in the San Joaquin Valley.,
who told this district, in effect, "You are about to have a
major flood."
Nov;, Buena Vista

Lake should fill with the flood

water of the Kern River before it comes down here to Tulare
Lake.

Tulare Lake is still going to take flood water from

three rivers.
And so, in 1952, they passed a resolution, and it
carried unanimously.

It says, right here in the minutes,

which are here In the Appendix, to put those people on notice
in the name of this district and the president was authorised
to write a letter in the name of the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District to tell Buena Vista Lake to take that Kern
River flood water before they turned it down on us, take
235,000 acre feet of it.
The notice was given in 1952.

Incidentally, that

22
was another example of the district exercising its flood
control jurisdiction.
Well, now, the notice was given in 1952 and it was
acquiesced in.

They couldn't have done anything else.

The

geology of the San Joaquin Valley is such that no one would
claim that Kern Pdver water should go anywhere other than
into Buena Vista Lake first.

It Is higher up on the river.

Well, 17 years went by.

Another major flood was

on its way in 1969; this same situation exactly obtained
except with one difference, one crucial difference.

In that

17-year period, to wit, from the year 1956, the J.G. Boswell
Company had leased all of Buena Vista Lake.
Well, now, that wasn't a legal difference.
wasn't a geological difference.

That

That wasn't any difference

at all as far as the lav; was concerned but it made an
enormous difference in the 1969 flood and that is why I am
here today.
The Appendix gives the whole story, three
reclamation districts, smaller units which are shown on the
exhibit three, printed in the Appendix, petitioned this
district, "Please put Buena Vista Lake on notice again."
A million, a hundred-thousand acre feet of water was on its
way to Tulare Lake.

A million, a hundred-thousand feet of

water, I think actually another 69,000, came to Tulare Lake
in the year 1969 and the district was formally petitioned by

23
resolutions drawn by other public bodies to notify Buena
Vista Lake as you did before because those 1952 notices had
been effective and they had not been ignored.
There was a meeting of this district on March 4,
1969.

The entire minutes are in evidence as exhibit six

and portions of the minutes are excerpted in the Appendix.

That motion was made and it was immediately moved

that that be tabled.
One Boswell director moved that it be tabled and
another seconded it and at that point, counsel appeared for
the Boswell Company and what he said is in the minutes.

It

is — the excerpt is given on page 48 of the Appendix, and it
is a remarkable statement.
The able counsel for the Boswell Company was
Mr. Kloster and the minutes state as follows:

"Attorney

Kloster at this point made disclosure for the record as to
the association of six of the directors of the J. G. Boswell
Company, indicating in some detail their stock ownerships and
employee affiliations," and then he gives the six directors
and he stated further, "he had advised these directors they

were not disqualified to vote on the Buena Vista matter.”
The motion to table carried six to four.

to whether the North Central Levee would have been held,
there are 60-some persons who would have been in imminent
danger of dying from a wall of water 15 and a half feet over
their heads and these Appellants respectfully submit that
those persons would have been interested in and affected by
such a development.
Q

Now that you have men tioned it in emergent

terms, was it a wall that would have corae suddenly or a

25

gradual rising of the water?
MR. GREER:

It would have depended on whether the

levee breached.
Now, typically when a levee goes, the pressure
behind it is so great that there is no

— it happens all

at once.
Q

Nothing gradual about it.

MR. GREER:
Q

Sir?

Nothing

MR. GREER:

gradual about it?

No, sir, no, sir, not at all.

The

water is there and it is at a very high level.
Q

Is the district sueable in tort under

California law?
MR. GREER:

There is a very complex system relating

to governmental immunity in California.

We filed an action

which there is an exhibit dealing with it to remove the six
responsible directors.

We wanted to get some relief that way

and I am •— I have to say to the Court that I did not have

case.

It has been pending on demur

of 1969 and has become moot by virtue of the

election of these directors over again.

That is the reason

that we filed the present proceedings.
Q

Supposing any of these homes had been washed

out as the result of claimed negligence or misconduct on the
part of the directors?

Would the district have been liable

26
for a suit in court?
MR. GREER:

I think —- yes, I think a tort cause

of action could have been stated.

I mention it, though, to

show the interest of the residents in the affairs of the
district because that water — that water was higher than
otherwise it would have been because of the Boswell interests
preventing us from giving notice from Buena Vista Lake.
Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Greer.

Mr. Newell, we'll enlarge your time.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. NEWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. NEWELL:

Thank you.

May it please the Court:

Let me take the last point up first because that
seems to be the motivating force behind this litigation.
The fact that the Buena Vista Lake is subject to a
flood servitude is disputed.
Court can take for granted.

That is not a fact that this
Indeed, the most learned treatise

I have ever read on this subject was written by Mr. Greer
when he represented the Interest who preceded the J. G.
Boswell Company in leasing Buena Vista Lake, which concludes
there is no flood servitude.
That is not a matter that this Court can take for
granted.

It can take for granted, however, what is in the

record and in the brief — it is just a footnote, but the

27
Court should know that at this famous meeting in 1369, as
indicated on page 28 of the Appellant's reply brief, the
General Counsel of the district advised the district it did
not have the power to bring the law suit.
The request was not to put Buena Vista Lake on
notice.

It was

a request to bring an action for injunction,

which would represent a potential liability to this district
of several million dollars if they lost.
Now, this district can function only through the
device of a district project.
its limited capacity.

It is important to understand

It isn't a public district that can

wheel and deal in governmental matters any time it wants to.
It can only act through the device of a district project.
There is no district project that would warrant the expendi­
ture of that much money and the General Counsel of the
district advised the district of that fact on that day.

Both

Mr. Greer and I were present at the meeting.
Maybe that can be disputed.

But the matter of the

flood servitude in Buena Vista Lake is not something that
involves a constitutional question in this Court, in my
judgment.
We are dealing here with a district that operates
through district projects, four of which have been enacted
in its history.

That is the Important election and to enact

a district project requires a majority of the value of the

28
land and a majority of the landowners voting
Appendix we

And in the

have put for the Court — placed for the Court <—

Defendant's Exhibit R and S which

are the ballots for the

election on Project four, which was a project to construct
two laterals from the state acqueduct to the west of Tulare
Lake to the lake at a cost of $2 million,500,000 and you vote
twice, ballot A and ballot B and to answer Justice Harlan's
questions to the prior case, these are formal elections
conducted by a board of election judges, a secret ballot with
all the formalities of any California election and the
ballots are two-fold.

You cast one for the number of votes

you have in relation to assessed values and one as a land­
owner so that Thomas J. Amos, whose land is assessed at
$10 value for project four has just as many votes on the
second ballot as does the J. G. Boswell Company.
It is not 38,715 to one.
regard.

It is one to one in that

So the California legislature has provided adaequate

protection for the small landowner.
Now, that does not answer the matter of lessees
and residents.

We will get to that in a moment.

But I

object and ask the Court to examine the simplistic and
philogistic reasoning by which counsel for the Appellants
would suggest this case be reversed as this:

A, in Avajry

versus Midland County, Justice White’s opinion, it stated in
effect that any time a state exercises power through the

29
local instrumentality of government and where there are
popular elections, the one rnan-one vote rule applies.
B, the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District is
a governmental entity, whatever that is.
man-one vote rule applies.

Therefore, the one

And that is just not the case.

In the one man-one vote cases this Court has
decided involving local elections, the elections have
concerned matters of interest to all of the populace, schools
sewers, police stations, libraries — in Kolodziejskl versus
Phoenix, matters of general interest to the populace, to the
electorate and the court has emphasized that.
I don't know why I am lecturing this court on Its
decisions, but that does obtain and then secondly there Is
a statement that where the lien maybe is only on land but in
fact the obligation Is going to be paid by all of the
citizens.
Now, the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage is not
that kind of an entity.

It is an entity created by a

petition of landowners who can conduct projects for the
benefit of the landowners and they pay for it exclusively.
Q

Would you think the district could validly

hold an election under a law that said that half the
landowners may vote and half may not?
MR. NEWELL:
Q

No, I would not think so.

Why not ?

30

MR. NEWELL:

That would be an invidious discrimina­

tion against landowners.
Q

That hasn’t got anything to do with the

reapportionment cases, has it?
MR. NEWELL:
Q

Or one man-one vote?

MR. NEWELL:
Q

I don’t think so.

I do not —

It is a question whether somebody is

invidiously precluded from voting.
MR. NEWELL:

No, I think there is the preliminary

question.
Q

Well, then, how about my example?

I®. NEWELL:

Well, can I ask you the first question?

I would suggest this, that — the question is, is it a
satisfactory classification to 3ay that landowners can vote?
Q

That is a perfectly good question.

So it

really isn't a question of one man-one vote, is it?
I®. NEWELL:
Q
whether somebody

I don't think this case is.

Well, no, it isn't.

But It is a question of

is validly or invidiously excluded from

voting.
MR. NEWELL:
Q

Well, you just asked me that question.

MR. NEWELL:
Q

No.

I — I —

Is it a valid classification?

31
MR, NEWELL:
Q

I think it —

That is the

MR. NEWELL:

same question, isn't it?

Well, there are two answers to the

question, and let me put to you, the simple answer is,
you look at the legislation to see if the classification is
reasonable, if
Q

anybody is invidiously excluded.
All right, and if it isn't reasonable, he is

invidiously excluded?
MR. NEWELL:

It is a tautology if you say that,

sure.
Q

And so your question is, which is here, is

whether the vote may be limited to landowners.
MR. NEWELL:

That’s -— yes, right, but I think there

is a preliminary question on the Equal Protections laws and
it is this, where the State of California or any state permits
a group of people — any segment of the population -- to band
together to accomplish a purpose that will concern them alone,
does the Federal Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause
reach that kind of a determination.
Q

Well, what if the vote here were limited to —

every other landowner could vote?
MR. NEWELL:

I would think — you — you wouldn’t

have the other landowners joining in the petition to form
the district.

They are not going to be in it.

This was the

State of California, Justice White, that has taken this

32
device to induce landowners to form these districts.

A large

landowner wouldn’t join in the petition unless he could be
in it.
Q

Well, X suppose the —- I suppose the district

could be set up in a way that didn’t accumulate votes based
on acreage, could it?
MR. NEWELL:

I don’t think it could.

There is a —

they petitioned to have their land formed and be in the
district.

It is a fairly complex procedure and you can

petition to have your land excluded.

I would think one of the

easiest ways to be excluded was, you weren’t going to vote.
Q

Can you automatically get out if you wanted

to?
MR. NEWELL:

Well, I would assume — you would have

petitioned to be in, in the first instance.

You would have

joined with your neighbors to form the district.
Q

Are you suggesting a practical type of

obligation?
MR. NEWELL:

No, but they band together under the

statute to try to accomplish improving their water system.
But it is a voluntary thing.
classification on them.
Q

The state doesn’t thrust this

The landowners choose to do this.

But an individual landowner can be involun­

tarily included within the district, can’t he?
MR. NEWELL:

I don’t think so.

33
Q

Well, then, the ease should go away, then.

MR. NEWELL:

It — it’s not a matter — that's a

matter of state lav;, I think.
Q

You mean If somebody —■ if somebody petitions

for a water improvement district to cover a certain area,
that everybody within that area is not included if there is
the right kind of a vote in an
MR. NEWELL:

election?

Everyone could be included but there is

a procedure to have the land excluded.
Q

Well, yes, there is a procedure —•

Q

That is discretionary with the board of

directors of the district, isn’t it?
MR. NEWELL:

Well, actually, I think it is heard

by others than the board of directors of the district.
Q

But you don’t have a — you can’t be

excluded as a matter of right.
confident is

The reason I feel fairly

Arizona, where I practiced, adopted California’s

system in this and, at least under our law, you could
petition for exclusion, but it was discretionary with the
people who passed on that petition whether or not you would
be excluded.
MR. NEWELL:

I am sure that is true, but I think it

would be unusual if some —- some dissident landowner would —would be included in and certainly, as every other landowner',
that they wouldn’t form the district, I don’t think.

But you

3^

must understand that California’s motivation in passing this
law is to induce landowners, large landowners, to form these
kinds of districts.
Q

But if it is just voluntary landowners, you

don’t need a district.
MR. NEWELL:
eminent domain.

You could do it by contracts.
No, you wouldn’t have the power of

For example, they had to condemn the land

for the laterals to the state acqueduct.

I mean, they have

certain rights that are important in that regard.
But the district's function is limited to projects
that are going to benefit the people in the district.

It

would be —

You mean the landowners?

That was a Freudian slip.

State of California to determine.

But that is for the

There Is nothing invidious

about excluding them because the state may conclude in its
wisdom that a lessee's interest is not enough.
Q

Oh, I agree.

You certainlyhave solved

the

case if you can start from the premise that you can tie the
power to the land.
MR. NEWELL:
Q

That's right.

Of course, the case is over then.

MR. NEWELL:

I thought it was over in the court

below.
No, that is right.

You can — I think that is a

matter of state court determination.

If you concede — in

other words, when you say the lessee should be able to vote,
you are conceding the validity of landowner

voting and if

that concession is made, I think it is up to the state
legislature, if it exercises sound discretion to say, well,
no, we will tie a vote to $100 of assessed valuation of land.
However,that land may be divided up between different
people.
Q

What is at issue here as to who — voting

rights are at issue here?

Is that it?

36
MR. NEWELL:

The challenge is that lessees and

residents, non-landowning residents.
Q

Both are at issue here?

MR. NEWELL:

Yes, lessees and residents, non­

landowning residents, qualified voters who reside in the
district.
Now, let’s talk about that.

There are 77 people

that live in this district, men, women and children.

Maybe —

I don't know how many of them, if they are citizens.

We

know Lawrence Ellison is registered to vote.

He is the only

one, the Plaintiff, Lawrence Ellison, that as a matter of
record is a registered voter.
In the Appendix is a list of where these people
live.

66 of them are employed by one corporate farm,

Westlake Farms.

You have got 11 people spread over what you

might say are 165,000 acres.

I mean, having residents vote,

it would accomplish nothing unless you are going to tell the
J.G. Boswell Company, well, now, look, don’t worry, we'll
let this fellow up here in the corner cast a vote as much as
yours and if it costs you $817,000, well, that is the
democratic way.
That doesn’t make sense.

If you are going to

accomplish the objectives that the California legislature
has in mind and I think I can't emphasize that too much, that
the legislature wants to encourage this type of arrangement

37
to finance water improvements and it has done it.

It has

done it successfully in Tulare Lake Basin, but they
only had four projects In its

years now.
Q

Mr. Newell, I’m not sure, if I were to ask

this hypothetical question — if you had no such lav/ as this
at all, how would the authority be exercised?

Would it be

up to the private individuals to form a cooperative ~
MR. NEWELL:
Q

Yes.

— on the one hand or up to the state to

move in and do it as a public works?
MR. NEWELL:

It would have to be the — the

individuals would just have to agree to do it as a matter of
private contract but, uh —
Q

And the state as a whole doesn't have that

much interest?
MR. NEWELL:

Well, the state has an interest in

the improvement of the availability of water for irrigation
purposes in California and has used lots of devices to do
this.

Now, this is one way of encouraging people to — to —

band together to take certain steps for this type of thing.
The concept storage, by way of explanation, the

Water

Storage Distract Act was really passed for Tulare Lake in
the first Instance and the original project one which is in
the Appendix was to — part of it was to acquire 18 sections

38
of land and store this water that routinely flooded.
Q

What was it?

It was a flood control project,

No — well, in part but it was also

I repeat, there are no people like

So it just went by the boards.
The next projects involved buying storage space

behind a reservoir on the flood control dams built after the
war.

And another one involved participating in flood

control concerned with the dams and then there is project
four to get the laterals to the district.
But the point about it, I think the best analogy
would be, if you took the analogy of the school district
case where the school was built solely for the use of the
landowners.

No one else could use it and they used it and

paid for it in proportion to their land.
It occurred to me in reading that decision that
the court might have reached a different conclusion were those
the facts, which is the fact in a water storage district.
I repeat that when the state takes a group of
people and says, now you may voluntarily band together to
accomplish this specific purpose, which the state legislature
deems in the interest of that objective, in this case of
agricultural water development, I don’t think that that gets
to the point where there is an equal protection problem.

something, much as you could form a private corporation.
Q

What if the lav/ said a flood control district

may be formed by a vote of the registered voters of this
district?

And didn’t permit landowners to vote as landowners.

It’s just if they were registered voters, they got to vote
and if not, not.

Would you think that there would be an

equal protection problem posed?
MR. NEWELL:

I think that that would be an

unrealistic approach to it by a governmental — by the
legislature to solve a governmental problem.

There aren’t

enough registered voters in the district to make any
difference.

There aren’t anybody.

There is nobody there.

I mean, you are not going to get people banding together to
form a cooperative venture if you have registered voters
vote.

There aren’t enough.

Five or six people?

You take, if you have each landov/ner cast one
ballot and you do away with a weighted ballot.

As the

Appendix points out, there was an oil venture some years
ago in what is called "the homeland district," which is the
southeastern quadrant of the basin storage district and they
sold a lot of participating interests in an oil well and
they have got small acreages there, two acres, ten acres.
Only from an oil speculating deal, that group of people, if
you have one vote per landowner would have effectively
controlled the election.

Well, just speak —

refuse to let them through?
MR. NEWELL:

Well, you see, it is hypothetical in

this instance, but the California state legislature
protected them from that by arranging this very rational
scheme.

They didn't place that power in the handful of

small landowners.

It doesn’t affect the public.

It affects these landowners and that is all, and the fact
that someone might be a resident out there, or an employee,
has very little to do with his participation in these
complex projects.
All of this has been stated before and, unless
there are some questions, I have nothing further.
Q

Would it be fair to analogize this to a

cooperative which has been given by the legislature a special
status for public funding purposes?

directors'

The

failure to have routine elections — which is a

matter of some comment here — exercise no significant
governmental power.

They can't do anything.

Now, there should have been an election in 1969
but, as the transcript shows, the Appendix shows, three of
the divisions were wholly flooded, a 100 percent flooded.
One was 56 percent under water and one wras 28 percent under
water and I can assure the court at this perilous lime, these
people were not interested in the niceties of taking a polling
booth on a scow out there to have an election.

They have a

polling booth in each precinct, each division.

But It

couldn't be.

It was too serious.

Now, there

is supposed to be an election in 1973.

There has been no petition filed by anybody seeking one of
these directorships.

No doubt, because as Mr. Greer has

indicated, you don't have campaigning in the political
sense.

It is different.

But there is no petition filed to

have any election this year so the incumbent directors will

45
continue on in accordance with the statute5 the California
statute on the subject.
Q

In what respect could it

be said that the

66 people on the one high-ground farm area and the 11 people
in the lowlands pay or contribute to this?
MR. NEWELL:

Well, they don't pay at all.

At all.
Q

Only landowners are assessed costs?

MR. NEWELL:

Only landowners, that's all.

And

they are assessed in accordance with the benefit conferred by
a project .

It so happens that the projects that have been

enacted have had — the board of assessment — I forget what
they call them — the commissioners — have judged that it
applied uniformly throughout the districts so the assessment
uras equal for each acre of land.

There were no differentials

but It is possible that there could be.
Q

On each acre.

MR. NEWELL:
Q

No.

But only landowners.

On the value of each acre.

No.

Is this one straight geographical?

MR. NEWELL:

For example, uh, yes, project four

was $2 million 500,000 and it was determined that there are
188,000-plus acres that were benefitted by their project and
it was assessed $13*32 per acre, irrespective of the
assessed value of a particular acre.

You have variations in

the assessed value of acres, as indicated, but this

46

particular project was assessed uniformly.
Q

So if a roan has a good many acres that are

simply piles of rocks with nothing growing on them, he is
still paying for it?
MR. NEWELL:

If that had been the case.

It so

happens that the land in the district;, however, most of it
is —
Q

Valuable land?

MR. NEWELL:

Except land that is for roads or

dikes or things of that kind.
Q

But the man with a pile of rocks being

obligated to pay would be dependent upon a finding by the
assessors that though that land did in fact benefit?
MR. NEWELL:

That is correct.

That would be that

and we assume that on that hypothesis, the board of
commissioners — by the way, none of them can own land in
the district.

They are appointed.

They cannot own land in

the district at all and I think one must be an engineer.

I

forget what the statute requires — but they would make that
determination and there is a right of sort of an appeal in
that where if there is a dispute one of the commissioners
appoints two outside people and they sit as a sort of a
board of assessment review; presumably a fair-minded
assessment board would determine that there was no benefit
to the pile of rock, and he would pay nothing.

47
Q

If the piles of rocks x^ere scattered about in

the midst of a rich, arable land, I take it that the
assessors would downgrade the value — downgrade that
benefit, rather?
MR. NEWELL:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

In that sense it would reflect the value.

MR. NEWELL:

Right.

And you will notice that

in the Appendix, we refer to the — or in the brief — we refer
to the fact that, like, one acre has got a $60

eight-

tenths of an acre is assessed at $60 and I think one acre
is assessed at $10.

There are differentials in the

assessment, depending on the worth of the land.
