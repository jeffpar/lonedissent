the Co1rt1
These five consolidat d c~ses present i portant
questions under the 1962 nm_1drnent
and Cosmetic l w.

to the Federal Food, Dru<

Under the predecesoor statute, the Food

and Drug Adi:> ni tr tion, in granting prcmnrk ting cl arance t
new drugs, is linited to con:'lincrinq U1e safety of those
drug; that'

all it viewed, w1eth r the drug was safe.

And the major change m de in the 1962 ar.iendmcnts, insofar as
thes

cascn

ro cone med, is that this pr marketing clearanc

was extended to cover the effectiveness of drugo as well a
theh: safety.
Th se ca
of t. e
th

a present before tho Court the qu stions

Food an

o r,rot

publ 1c

interstate commerce of ineffective drug~.
The statutory provisions i'lre qu~te det&iled and
complicated, and in order to put the issuen in the proper
perspective and indicate the interrelationship among the issu s
in the cases, before discussing the particular c~ses, I would
like to make a rathe~: generalized statement t.nat is applicab'
to all the cases, in which I will first describe the backgrou d
and history of the statute, then deal with its particular
provisions and final:.y explain the adninistrative steps that
the Pood and Drug 1\dninistration has taken to implement this
statute.
After this opening statement whj_ch, according to my
best estimate, should take around twenty minutes, the cases
will t."len be argued in three separate segnents.

The first

segments will consist of the Bentex and CIEJ\ cases, which I
will argue for the government; and ' in each segment the case
will be viewed as a separate case, that is, the opening
argument will be made by the government in the first two and
by respondents, petitioners' counsel, the drug cor,1pany, in
the third; then there will be an answering argument, and this
in turn will be follCMed by rebuttal,
So th.3 Court will have, in the way of an oral
presentation, an opening statement applicable to all of the
cases, followed in effect by three separate consecutive
arguments, in which, as I think it will develop, the issues are

6

somewhat interrelatec.
tlow, the starting point in the analysis of this
statute is the 190G Food and D~ug Act.

That Act prohibited

the distribution in interstate commerce of adulterated and
misbranded drugs.

nut the Act had no provision for premarket

clearance of the druos by any administrative agency.

HJ

The

only sanctions under that Act were procccdinq to forfeit the
misbranded or adulterated drugs and criminal prosecutions.
In 1938, as the result of a tragic accident in whicl

a nur.iber of people died as the result of taking a drug that
had not been teoted and proved to be unsafe, Congress passed
the Federal Food, Drug, e.~d Cosmetic Act, which, for th

firs~

time, provided for prcmarkcting cl~arance o( drugs before the
drugs could be distributed in interstate commerce,
The statute prohibited the introduction of any new
drug unless there was in effect an application that had been
filed with and permitted to become effective by the Secretary
of Agriculture.

These applications for the marketing of new

drugo are kncwn in the industry as llDA' s, new drug npplicatior ,
and both the government ant the counsel for respondents will
use that to:rro to deccribc them.
The statute also provided that after notice and
opportunity for hearing, the Secretary could deny any application for new drug approval if he found either that the drug
was not safe, or that he was unable to find that it was safe:

7

and, finally, it permitted the suspennion of an approved new
drug application if subsequent evidence developed to show tha
the drug was unsafe.
The 1938 statute also substantially expanded the
enforcement authority of the Food and nrug Ad-ni.nistration, it
gave the -- correction; the Secretary of Agriculture.

The

statute in turn delegates the powers to the Secret ry of
Agriculture and that was transferred to the Secret ry of
Health, Education, and Helfare, but he las delegated virtuallJ
all of his powers under the statute to the Food and Drug
Admi .istration i and I will use tho term "Secretary" and "Food
and Drug Administration" interchangeably.
The statute authorized the Secretary to promulgate
regulations for the efficient enforcenent of tJ- e Act, g-ive th_
agency authority to conduct investigations, a.1d finally
expanded the district court authority to include suits for
injunction in addition to forfeiture and criminal proceedings
Now, the pL-ocessing of these new drug applications
is a -QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, before you go on to that.

Prior to the 1962 amendments, if you'll tell me again, what: was
the mechanism, the enforcement mechanism?
and desist order?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

No, the

Or injunction?

Wa•3 it only a cease

8

1m. PJUEDI-Wl:

-

110.

In addition to that, under the

before thn 1962 JI.ct, the Secretary had authority to deny

approval ton new drug application if he either fou.~d that

tl11

new drug application, that the drug was not safe or that they
had failed to find it 11as safe; and, in addition to thnt, he
had the authority to withdraw

pproval after notice and

opportunity for hearing if subsequent development
NOA had becorno effective indicated the

after t.he

rug wae not safe.

Then, in a dition to that, there were tie nncillari

I

we believe t.,e ancillary remedies of proco dingo in the
district court, under which, ur,der tha 1938 l\ct -- prior to
the 1938 l\ct, they could , nly proceed through criminal
procc~dings or forfeiture, but the 1938 Act expanded this to
give Food and Drug, the government, the

uthority to seek

injunctive r lief in the district court ,
But, as a practical mattor, as a practical matter
because of the nature of drugs and public concern, it's a
rare instance in which a drug nanufacturer would attempt to
market the drug if the Food and Drug Administration concluded
that it could not permit the new drug application to become
effective.

In other words, our bnoic position hero is that the
primary enforcement r:: thod that Congress selected in the 1938
Act as increased and improved in the 1962 Act was the
udministrative procedure of premarkcting clearance for drugs,

•

That is, that the agency would star.d at the gateway
before the drugs could get into the channels of interstate
commerce and say whether or not they would perni t these drugs
to be distributed.
QUESTION, 11ith respect to !JDA, the new dr 1g applications?
Mn. FllIEDMl\N:

That is right.

Ye~, sir, I will come to that in

one or two n.inutes, Mr, Justice,
QUESTION:

Mn.

night,

FRIEDMAN:

After just making this one point, th t

the processing of these new drug applications is an extremely
tirne~conswning and difficult task. They're huge things,
are filed with a mountain of scientific information.

They

They

may have stntements from as many as several hundred doctors
giving their views on these drugs.

They ai-e papers, lengthy

analysis, I am told that they sometimes occupy as much as
several hundred volut1es.

They may fill half of a room, and

obviously it would have been an enormou• task for Food and
Drug juat to process these applications as they were filed,
And I would mention that in the period between the
1938 Act and the 1962 i\ct, Food and Drug processed and

permitted to become effective almost 10,000 of these applica-

10

tions, and at the time the 1962 Act was passed, it was
estil"il8.ted thc,ro were approximately 4,000 of these application,
covering drugs that were t.~en being distributed.
?low , the fact of life in the drug industry is thnt

there are a large number of drugs on thCJ market which are
basically tho same goncric drug, but with var.ous che ic.:il
differences .

They arc fundruoontally the s = , but they havo

slight variations .

Most of these drugs would co

market after a new drug application had becom

on the

effective .

What would hcppcn is , one or two new drug application

ould

coine on the market, the drug would be in use for two or three
yearc , and it tumed out to be safe; and of course under the
1938 net, sefety was the sole criteria for pa nin

on new drua

applications.
And following this, a number of oth r large
pharmaceutical firms would put on tho market similar.

roducts

for nont1ally labeled -- label goos of course to tho doctor,
we're not talkinq of the label on a package of patent m dicin ,
thio is the lnbel that tollo tho doctor what: the drug will do
- - labeled basically, making the same , or very sir.dlar claim:;
to those in tho drug& where the new drug applications w re
outntnnding.
Sine , und r tho 1938 statute , the teat of a new
drug was whether the drug was safe, and since by definition ,
after the now drug applications had heen determined to be saf,

the so-called "me-too" drugs, which is what the indm;try call
the drugs that are patterned afti>r. the Nnl\ dr-..igs, for which n
NOii. is in effect, they came to be recognized as not new drugs

or old drugs, and they caine on the market.
The estima~es are that in the prescript.on drug
field there'::: anywhe~e from five to thirteen "i.e-too' s '· for
ever}• drug with respect to which an Nn11. is outnte.nding,
So that by 19G2, when the anendments were pacsed, t e
best estimate is that there were probably 30 to 50 thousand
drugs outsti'.lllding in the roe-too category, and that is just
in the prescription drug field.

In addition, the over·•the-

counter drug field has a vastly greater number.

tt.'s in1possil,lo

to know, but the best estimate of Food ..nd Drug is probably
there were 200,000 drugs in the over-the-counter m·rket.

Mr, Friedman, when you talk ,lhout "me-to "

that has a eirn.ilar but not identical chemical 00111.;lOund and a

Well, it may be identical, it may

actually ho identical, but at least it's similar.

Now , with the l i.mi ted staff that

And thon jUllt think of the lawyers,
Unfortunately, they don't have onoug

Now, between 1959 and 1961, the Senate conducted
lengthy hearings on the drug industry, and one of the things
that came out in those hearings wns that the Food and Drug
Administration was powerless to deel with the fact that many,
many drugs wore ineffectivo to accomplish the claim mad
them.

for

And the problem was recognized as a serious one, thcro

was a great deal of testimony .

nut Food and Drug, of couroe,

at this time had no authority to provide preclearanc
for l'larketing drugs on the grounds of ineffectivcnc-ss.

approva

17

And Congress, in 1962, closed this regulatory gap
by giving Food and Drug, for the first time, the authority
to apply the preclearance technique to the effectiveness of
drugs as well as their safety.
Under the amended s~atute in ~ection 505, the
Secretary is required to disapprove an application for a new
drug if he finds there is substantial evS.dence -- I'm sorry,
if he finds ther.e is a lack of substantial evidence that the
drug will be able to have the effect and do the things claime

Congress also heard at these hearings of the
importance in ascertaining the effectiveness of di:ugs that
there be adequate clinical, scientific studies.

There was

repeated testi1nony, much of which we have e.ummarized in our
brief in th~ Hynson case1 repeated testimony that you c&nnot

doctors state that they use it in their practice and they havo

Right.

But that • s uhat is t11eant by the anecdotal?
MR. PRIEDMllll I

Anecdotal , as distinguished from the

scientific, clinical study.
QUESTION I Right.

MR. FRIED iAN I

Congress did a rather unu.:iual thing

in this stntutc, because of the evidence before i t that
clinical studiec were important.

It said in tho statute that

tho Secretary should not approve a n~w drug npplication unlesL
he found by substantial evidence it was effective, it went on
and defined in the statute what it rnoant by substantiiil
evidonoo.

And substantial evidonco , under this statute , moan,

something very different than eubatantial evidenc

in the

traditional administrative statute.
It defines substantial evidence in the statute as
conctituting, moaning adequate and well-controll ed inveJtiga-

19
tions, including clinical investigations by eY.perts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effecti eneso of the drug involved.
And Congress also expanded the definition of new
drugs to cover effectiveness, so that a new drug ia now
defined as one not generally recognized among the experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to eval".latc tl
safety and effectiveness of drugs.
Two other things that the statute did in the way of
strengthening the administrative authority of the Food and
Drug Authority:

First, under the predecessor statute in

1938, a new drug application became effective automatically
wiless the Secretary affirmatively disapproved it.

This

was changed in the 1962 Act to provide that the application did
not become effective unless the Secretary affirrr.atively
approved it.
The stat~to also provided that after an interim
period of two years, the Secretary was required, if, on the
basis of new informatio~ before it, there was a lack of
substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it

HR. FRIED/WI: So that i t mennt that until October

10th, 1964, Food and Drug could not begin proceedings -Qur.STIOH: night.
MR. FRIEDMl\N:

to withdraw the new drug a

rovaL

on the ground that the drugs would be ineffective.
now , the Food and Drug Administration recognized
imnediately that with 4,000 new drug applications outstanding,
approved applications, ?IOA's , it just couldn't itself undortcl e,
with its liclted staff, to evaluate evory one of these.

So

what it did was it called upon a group of eminent ncientists
of the National Academy of Sciences and its constituent,
National nesearch Council, for aid in determining the validit,
of the offoctiveness clairng of this large number of drugs.
And what the national Academy of Sciences did was i
sot

i..p

panels, thirty panels, oach panel containing six

-

21

experts with respect to the particular type of drug involved.
The companies 11ere requested to submit all evidence they had
concernir.g the effecl:ivoness of their drugs as claimed to
these panels: the panels then evaluated each of these drugs
and made recommendations to Food and Drug with respect to their
effectiveneso.
They evalt,ated the drugs, and ~hat happeneid was as
follnws:

The panels found, of all of these drug~, of these

4,000 NDA's that were reviewed, 7 percent were ineffective, a
considerable number were descrited as effective, and the bal· co
was somewhere in between: they described them as possibly
effective, p>."Cbably effective, effective but, effective uith
respect to Po~s claims and not all,
Many of the labels, of course, suggested the drug
was suitable for more than one condition, EJld of the 4,000
NDA's, there were approximately 16,000 claims, and the Nation..l
Academy of Sciences panels found that only 19 percent of these
alleged claims of effectiveness were valid.
After these studies were made, the Food and Drug
Administration had a large conference wit.~ the industry in
Janu;Jry of 1968, and it announced that its policy would be to
apply the. conclusions of the national Academy of Sciences to
all drugs , not only to the drugs that were covered by the
HOA' s, but also by the me-too drugs.

And what they announced

they said they would do is that they would issue notices and

22

opportunity for hearing with respect to all of the NDA
manufacturern whose drugs were found ineffective, and that
they would pannit the me-too's to come in to those hearings
to be heard.
Following -- the best estimate was that ns a result
of these procedures they would have to conduct oor. thing like>
a thousand hearings.

1\nd in 1969, in the hope of making thL

problem mw1agedblo, they issued further regulation

in which

they defined what would constitute an adequate and , 11controlled study, very specific, they told ei.actly what it h,
to be, and they also said l:hat if a manufacturer requested a
hearing, they would not grant a hooring unless he produced,
as indicated as the substantial evidence that ho would produc ,
that type of evidencor that is, the well-controlled studies,
the validity of thio regulation is at issue in another one of
the~e easer,.
And then finally, in 1972, tho Food and Drug
Administration issued another roqulntion which more specifica ly
put tho ir.e-too'e on notice that the withdrawal of the NDA for
the so-called pioneer druqa would aloo apply to the me-too
drugs.
OUESTIONr

Hr. Friedman, does the statute give the

Commissioner expressly authority to define by regulation tho
statutory language in S0S(d) pertaining to substantial
evidence?

-

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There is a specific general authority

to promulgate rules and regulations.

a very broad statute.

Section 701; and it's

It authorizes him to promulgate rules

and regulations necessary for the effective implementation of
the Act.
There is no specific provision giving the Com:nissioner
authority to define further what constitutes !lubstantial
evidence, but we believe that as a general exercise of
administrative authority, this b~-ord rule-making power does
permit him further to define and particularize the standard
of substantial evidence which Congress provided.

He's not

changing it, he's merely explaining what is meant by a wellconducted clinical study and investigations.
Now, ue think that this leg.i.slative history that
I've given dramatizes and brings homo t.~ree things, which I'd
just like to reiterate now, because they are critical to the
legal issues in the cases.
First, by the 1962 amendments Congra!ls intended to
take off the market, to talce off the na1·ket, drugs that had
not been shown to be effective.

l\nd Congress decided to do

this primarily by expanding the authority of the Food and
Drug Administration's premarketing clearance authority to
cover effectiveness as well as safety.

It required that the

definition of whether a drug be effective be put in terms of
high probative scientific studies.

24

Secondly, aa I think I have indicated, Food ru1d Dru
was faced with this enormol13 administrative p~obJe~, and
it couldn't possibly deal with the situation on the basis of
a drug-by-drug procedure, of bringing 4,00v separate proceedi qi.
It had to deal with it on a more comprehennivo ba<·is •
.1\nd finally, we think the method it has selected,
the use of the National Academy, with its panelo of experts,
the opportunity given to the manufacturers to co~

in after

the scientific <Jtudics had been made and to show why in effec ,
in fact, their drugc were effective in accordance with their
claims under principles of adequate and well-controlled
clinical investigations was a reasonable and fair method of
dealing with the problem •
.1\nd with this as a background, I'd now like to turn
to the two co.sea I'm going to argue, the Dcntex case, which i

here on certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, and the CillA case,
which is here on certiorari to the Third Circuit.
The queation in each of these cases is whether the
Food and Drug Administration hao jurisdiction to detorrnine
whether a product is a new drug to which the prenarketing
clearance procedures and the withdrawal procedU1.--eo of Section
SOS

of the statute arc cpplic:iblo.
Our contention io that the Secretary and the FDA

does have that authority.

The Fourth Circuit hold and the

res,ondents contend that he does not1 and as they view his

studies, Food ~na

Crug concluded prel .. minarily ti-at there was not substantial

so stating, and giving the rnanu ·acturer

of these three

drugs the opportunity to request a hearing to show why the
drug was ef ective, and it also invited any interested perso
who might be adversely affected by the removal of these druqs
from the market to participate.

And finally, the notices

stated that the withdrawal of the NDA's for th~se three druqs
will cause any such druq on the market to be a new druq for
which an approved new drug application is not in effect, and
will make it subject to regulatory action.
Orie of the three NOA holders submitted some m terial
which Food and Drug found was not substantial evidence as

defined by the statute.

QUESTION:

It was not enacted until ~972.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

They had no way -- but they did know, tney did know
at least that Bent.ex and somo of the other,:; 11ere manufacturin
th:i.s drug.
N->w, the response of Bentex to ,.hii· r c-ucst for
informati0n ac to what it was goinq to co to remove the drug
from the market was to bring a lawsuit for a dec:aratory
judgrn:int, in which Bcntex, joined by 22 other m -coo manufacturers, they souqht a declaratory judgment that they, their
products we.:e not new drugs and were not subject to the
application procedures of Section SOS.
Then the government, in the district court, moved t?
dismiss the suit on the ground that the district court had no
jurisdiction to deteanine this question, that this wes -- we

28

made two argu.'1\Cnts:

one, that this was a matter

\I.

that since Dantex had had the opportunity to c

in to t'le

proceedings for the withdrawal of th~ NDA's, B nt x as oarrc~
from litigatir.g this question in thP dictrict court.
The district court rejected thos

argument~, and h

that it and Food and Drug hacl concurrent jurisdiction, bu
alco rejected the plaintiff's contention i

it

that lawsuit that

the district court had exclusive jurisdiction to dctcrwine tr
question of new drug status.
And wh:1.t it said

And the court then sai~ that it t~ought it wao
appropriate that the Food and Drug ~dministration should
decide this question in tbe first instance, because, it said,
the nature of the proof relevant to that iosue makes Food and
Drug the more able arbiter of the question.

So tho ev~luaticn

of conflicting reports in the field is not a matter well left
to a court without chemical or medical background.
And, aecordinqly, the district court deferred any
proceeding" in th

case until Food and Drug had an opportunity

d

29

to conduct a hearing on the new drug issue.
The government did not appeal th,it aspect of the- ca ·e,
and has accepted the remand .

But I wan1: to make it quit~

clear to the Court tnat while we do, if the Court agrees with
us in this case, plan to hold a hearing, we do not contemplat
that the hearing will be the typical evidentiary trial type
hearing; we think i.t appropriate to concluc

a hearing a long

the rule-making lines, which the agenC'J is now urlnq in this
case.

Now,! may just very briefly turn to the facts in
the CIBA case, which ~xe~ents the sar.1e issi..e, though in a
d i fferent context.
CIBA did have an NOA, and its drug was reviewed by
the National Academy of Sciences, the claims were found
ineffective. They uent through a whole ser:i.es of procedures,
notices were given .

The climax of this was that Food and Dru

withdrew the NOA for CIBA's drug .
CIBA took that question to the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit .

The Second Ci~cuit affirmed.
•

At this

point -- in the interval, CI!lA then filed a district court
suit in New Jersey, in which CIBA claimed chat it was not a
new drug and that it was exempt, and it wanted to have that
issue determined.

The district court di.smissed.

The Third

Circuit affirJl'ed , basically following the reasoning of the
district court in the Bentex case, saying that when Food and
Drug undertook to withdraw the new drug application, that it

g

36

necessarily had -- must have deciaed the threshold ~ueJtion
of whether it was a new drug: that CIBJ\ c,1allcnged .:he order

the Food and Drug Ad~inistration had jurisdiction to deciae t e

Circuit, and there w s no occ~sion for CIB

OUESTION1 So it didn't say whether a diotrict court
would have jurisdiction to consider a declaratory

action?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, it did not.

All that it held tas

that Food anj Drug did have jurisdiction , and that of course
is the only issne directly involved in these cases where the
Food and Drug has jurisdiction.
!~ow, the problem we have with th

decisions of the

17

Fourth Circuit in this case, and the co~tention~ of the
responde.nt is that it would ba~ically transfer to the distric.
courts , to the district courts, the primary enforcement
responsibility. That is, it would bar Food and Drlq from
making these threshold determinations, ever, thoug"l Cong.cess
in the 1972 statute made its intention qui~e clear that it
intended to strengthen the hand of Food and Druq <..n uithdrawi a

Under the Fourth Circuit rule, thouqh,

Food and Drug can refer for prosecution, it can initiate in
that manner, can ' t i~?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It can initiate in that manner, Mr.

Justice , but it cannot deal with the vast bulk of these
applications, because prosecution in this field is not really
an effective method.

It ' s not an effective method for qettin

off the market these thousands of drugs which seemingly, on
the basis of the National Academy of Sciences' studies, are
i neffect ive.
That is the whole purpose - - the whole purpose of

38
this statute was to qive Food and Druq administrative ~uthori y
to do the job it had not been able to do under the 1938 Act.

A.~d we think the c1istrict court, ir tho B t x ca

It's traditional that administrative agencies have autlority
to determine their own jurisdiction. That'o the threshold
question.
When a cl1,:rn is llll:de that no

whether the statute

t,nd before yo~ can decide whether or not a new druq

And it seems to us rather incongruous to suggest

that Congress, which attempted to strengthen FnA's authority
in the 1962 a endrnents, intended to deny to FnA t..,ts kind of
authority to determine its own jurisdiction, t1at agencies

ON BEHALF
MR. SZUCH:

OF

CIBA COPPORATION

l•r. Chief J11stice, and

,1

y it plc.1sc

the court:
T'1e government continues to refer to a tt,resho 1o
issue in connection with approvals of the

e

i

druq appl i.ca·-

tions.
In order for there to be a thres old issue, something
must be decided.
It would be our position that in connection with
the prosecutions and filings of new o:cuq applic;.tions, there
is, in fact, no threshol~ issue, because tnere is no
jurisdictional issue for the Food and Dcug Administration to
decide.
QUESTION:

Then you agree that the district court

would have a de novo proceeding to resolve these questions?
MR, SZUCH:

We would take the position that the

issue of new drug/old drug only comes about in connection with

40

actions of enforcement, such as seizures, prosecutio~s,
criminal natures, or injunctions brouqh

by the

ood

d

Drug Aciministration after it has inc'ua.d, inrep::n cnt of~
new drug application, that the product out trlre

hem r

is in fact a new product within the meaninq of Sect·
as opposed to Section 505 of th

E

2J 'pl

Act.

If one looks at Section 505 and one e
actually happens, I believe that the

mine

what

hres old i ~uc will

dinappear.
When a manufacturer has a dru~ which <t wishes to
mark t, it has the initial obliqatio~ of d tcrmining whether
the drug is new or old,
If he decides, or it decides tha~ the drug is ir f
a ne, drug, it then qoes to the a8ministrat~on and fil~s a

new drug application, seeking approval of that application.
Once the new drug ap~licatlon ha~ been pr~ ent d to th
administration, ther

ia no longer any itsuc before it as to

whether that druq is a new or an old ~ruq.

'he manufacturer

says nothinq in its application to the Foo~ and Drug
Administration on that issue.

The statute calls for nothing

on that issue.
The matter is put before the authority, it decides,
and then we're off.
Taking the other oituation of the withdrawal, the
fact that the drug i

new or ola is irrelevant to whether the

t

41

Food and Drug should withdraw its npproval of the ND/I

which

may be filed.
For exarapl.e, even if one were to a

ume and cone ck

the governrno,,t ant the manufacturer, th t t-he drug were, an ol
drug, if the manufact:urer were not filinq thE' rcouis.cte
reports requir~d by 505, it seems mandatory th t approval of
the new drug applicatj_on be withdrawn for the t _eason.
There does not seem to be any optic~ in the statute,
we would submit, which •1ould authorize the Administrator to
decide that he's not going to act in this particular instar.c0,
to not withdraw because the drug is old.
Similarly, there -QUESTION:

On tt,e other hand, once a manufacturer put., ir o

application on file for that pr~duct, the FDA may oecide fer
itself that the product io in fact a new product.

Thir.

decision would be under Section 20l(p) of the st... tut , which
defines whether a product is a new or a., olcl druq.

would submit, however, that there is logic

to this dual route on thi:i issue.
No. l, the statute doesr't put thiG issue before th•
government under 505.

QUESTION:

Is there any other regulatory scheme,

Mr . Szuch, that functions on that kind of structure, that
you can suggest?

rm. SZUCH:

No, I cannot, because essentially, I

think that the structure here is peculiar because of the

First, rcqardinq our products.

The issue before you in o•tr case is whether the
question, whether our products are olcl c'lrugs, nnd \then I use
the term "old drug", I include a druq which may currently be
generally recognized both as safe and effective, and druqs
which enjoy the grandfather provisions.

As to whether that

determination can validly be made by the Fooa and Drug
Administration in some sort of administrative procedure, or
whether Congress designated that determin-3.tion in ari appropri
ate case to be made solely by th0 federal juniciary, starting
with an action in the district court.

not in the statute, is it?

So we can't talk loosely about old drugs

and new drugs in the generic,

words; but the question here is whether or not this is a,

MR. TOWNES:

Yes, sir.

they kept day-to-day track of tho literature, they subscrib d
to many journals, they went to rnany syr1posia, thoy read many
boo:a1, they converse wi h their colleague,;, they attended the

51

meetings, and they were familiar with the reoutation.
hnd then you would ask them, What is that reputatirn?
And he would say, Well, nobody -- most drugs are orctty safe,
so let's let this expert say thc.t this is recoqnized as safe.
And then he would be asked, Is it teccm1ized as effective?
And he 1-,ould say, WeD, frankly, no, it usc-d to be, a lo ig

went on we realized that it really didn't work: and nobody
pays any attention to it now.
Now, that is the government's case, really, in so
many words.
The manufacturer, iF he is attempting to defend this
case, and very, very, very few of these cases either have bee,
defended or will be defenqed, because the burden on the
manufacturer is extremely great.
Once that testimony has been put up against him, he's
got to, by his own experts of equal stature really, if you
want -- you have to have them of equal stature -- so that
for some reason the government experts 11ere mistaken in their
estimate of their colleagues' general opinion.

In 1938,

Congress said, Well, for new drugs -- for new drugs -- let's

Now, Congress was talking about;;. new c'iruq, something
ne11.

And it came up with the definition which ie as good a

definition as you can come up with, at that t'Oint a new drug
was defined as a drug which qualified experts qener.-.lly did
not regard as safe.

And it's a difficult definition to apply

at times , but I don't see how you can improve on it.
Now, as to everything else in the '38 Act pertaining
to this general situation, there were these police powers
created.

If you ship a new drug without approval, if you

misbrand a drug , if you adulterate a drug, the product can
be seized in a district court1 you can be enjoined in a district
court, and you can demand a jury; or you can be prosecuted in
a district court,

Would that proceeding affect just the

Actually, the Food and Drug, I think, know

than it would admit as to who makes what , because, for a

pier.ea up the labolr and everything, I iust don't think they•~e

MR. TOWNES:

Not at all.

If I may be so bold, I

not only don't think it is, but we have a number of cases of
this type, not a declaratory judgment, -- this is an inverse

If there

There can't be any difference,

a difference, there is a penalty, in

effect, to the bringing of a declaratory judqmcnt

which this should never be.
QUESTION:

Does the Food and Drug Administr tion

have any authority to issue a cease and desist order?
HR. TO\olNES:

No, sir; not as such . They write you

letters that in their opinion you're doing wrong.
Now, the ordinary response is that you quit doing
wrong.

If you have a violent disagreement with them, and

feel that the matter is capable of litigation, then you await
their seizure, you await their injunction, or you brinq a
declaratory judgment action.
QUESTION: All of those proceedings are in the diotrict
court?

57

MR. TOWNES: Those are all clistri,;t court proceeding
B\\t the issues are so 6.i.f'ferent in a ne,; drug
application .

You are supposed -- every crit(rie relates to

the results of scienti fie tests, and in t1'e question of \•1hcsth r
a drug is new or old, you're talking about Pr:ifesaor So-and-s-,,
Yes, I am familiar with aspirin, I kr.ow its reputation
in the scientific world, I ' ve re"d volumes about it, I've
discussed it, and everyone in the scientific community, in
my opinion, recognizes aspirin to be safe for this purpose.
On the other hand, J.'m f\1rtl1er fam5'iar uith acne

with aspirin; and in my opinion no one -~n +:.h

scientific

collU1\unit)• recognizes a3pirin to be e"fective fox acf'e.
So, the resulting holding by the court is that
aspirin is generally recognized as safe for t

10

t:.:,~atment of

acne, aspirin is not generally recognized as effective for
the treatment of acne.
QUESTION:

But don't you agree that the '62 Act wa~

MR. TOWNES: The '62 Act made r-o change as to
j\\risdiction: absolutely none.

It said, from now on new drug

applications must contain evidence of effectiveness.
QUESTION:

But it did change the procedure by

putting in specifically what they meant by the evidence.
MP.. TOWNES:

They changed what they meant by

58

evidence of effectiveness, as relates to the criterion in a
new drug application .

They added effectiveness, they addea

the criteria of effectiveness.

criteria are quite interesting.

Well, you've got two problems, Mr.

MR.

I see.
llhile they have conducted certain

little tests of their own, they are not tests adequate to meet
these standards .
QUESTION:
HR. TOWNES:

I see.
Now, if we can show that the community

generally recognizes this product to be botn safe .ind
effective, then our whole task is much simplified.
Now, this qeneral-reputation proof is both a
terrible burden, in the sense that you've got to get qualifiel
academic people to say, Yes, everybody knows this druq, it's
good, it works, this is the way it's reqarded.

If you can

get that, which is a terrific burden, then the method of proof
is very simple,

You pull in your three witnesses, they

testify for a morning or so, and you do not have to

qo

through

all these elaborate t~sting procedures and so forth, because

60

the c~mmunity accept~ the drug.

REBUTTJlL AilGUMEN'I' OF DANIEL M. FRIEPl!AN, ESQ . ,

ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTIES
MR , FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court1
I just would like to say two thinqc; briefly in
rebuttal;
First, in response to a colloquy that Justice
Stewart had with Mr. Szuch, tt e FDI1 on many occasions has sen
back applications that have bE:en filed for new druqs on the
ground that nobody -- that it was not r..:ieded, i. e, , that it
n ,sn ' t a new drug.
Secondly, I juct want to stress the -- it se2ms to
us that the a!'lomaly of the respondents' position here is well
illustrated by ~he facts of the CIBA ca~e itself.
The reason Food and Drua initiated a withdrawal
proceeding in the CIBA case was because it had reason to
believe that CIBA's d,:ug was ineffective and it wanted to sto,
CIBA from marketing that .

It held a full proceeding, it

concluded that CIBA's drug was ineffective; it withdrew the
NOA, and that action was upheld by the Court of Appeals.
Now, under this theory that Food and Drug has no
authority to determine the new drug status, this whole
proceeding would amount to basically a nullity, because CIBA
now claims it can turn around and relitigate under the new
drug standard in the district court the c.uestic,n whether or

62

not it ' s able to marKet it at all .
QUESTION: But in the ~cantime i t could be pro~ecute ·,
even by a confession?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It could be prosecuted, Mr. Justice,

but again I come back to the fact that

and Drug can do is , when it finds one that it think

is

ineffective, io to brinq a s•.1i.t in the district court to enjoin
them, to seize the drug, or to prosecute thorn criminally.
QUESTION:

Mr . Friedman, is appellate review of the

action of the FDA based on oome section of th

Food and Drug

Act or on the Adl!linistrative Procedure Act?
HR. FRIEO:.IAN:

It depends on the typo of action.

If it's the action in either denying a new drug application o
withdrawing an effective NOA, that woul~ be under Section
SOS(h) which permits court review in the Court of Appeals ,
which i~ the route , of courcc, CIBA followed .

tf it's a

MR. FREY:

~:r.

Chief. J •it ice, and may it plec.s.;, tl,'

Court:
The Hynson cases, No. 394 ~nd 411, are r_re on writ
of certiorari to review a ~udgment of the Fot•rth Circuit,
holding

that the Commissioner act _a imoro;-erly i

wi trdrawin

approval for Hynson's product Lutrexin without a hearing.
Lutreld.n is a drug product who~€ active ingrcdis.1t,
lututrin, is an extract t'rom sow o·.raries.

It's offered for

the treatment of dysr.,enorrhea, threatened and habi tu 1
abortion, and to pre,ent premature labor.
Hy.1son i'iie.; a nt?w drug application for Lutrexin in
1953, at whi:::h time safety wa5 the sole cr.iterion for

evaluation of such applications.

The agency allowed the

application to go into effect, although it wrote Hynson,
adviJing it at that time that the study submitted did not
indicate that the drug was effective for these purposes, and
urging him not to market it, particularly for threatened and
habitual abortion,

•

64

Now , after the 1962 amendment~, Lutrexin w

reviewed by the Nat.i.onal Academy o( Scicnc.::i, 1h1.ch cor.c-'uct
-- the pnne1 concluded that :lynson's c1a·11

scientific studies to support them.

Lu~r~xin

e:,:in w ::c
qua
rate

possibly effective, which was a rating ~ha~ sp ci i al•y ma
that the panel found there wa~ a l ek of s.ib.tan; 1 evi en~
supporting tutrexin's effectivene s .
lifter receiving the National Aeade y of Scienc
rating and making his own review of the inf'orr:iatioi before hi ,
and giving Hynson the opporturi.ty to submit further informat• n,
the Commissioner tentatively concluded that there was no
substantial evidenc~ of the offcctiveneJs of LYtroxin, and
in iarch 1969 p\lblished a notic~ of his intent to withdra
approval for Lutrexin's new drug applic tion.
He offered an opportunity for hearing, wh"ch Lut::-cx1n
at that time -- llynson at that time accepted,
Then in August 1969 Hynson filed suit in the district
court seekinq to block further proceedings before the agency,
A yeat later this suit was dismissed on primary juriadiction
and exhaustion grounds, and Hynson was remitted to the aqenCy.
In the meanwhile, FOA had adopted the regulations
which Mr. Friedman described to you, carefully defining what
kinds of

tudies would be considered adequate and well-

controll

,

o tt t thy coul1 qualify as substantial evidence

65

of effective under the 1962 amendments.
The regulations further dealt with the question of
when a hearing would be made available, and it required the
manufacturer in requesting a hearing to subrn't., and I'm quoti~q
from th-: regulation as it appe.:irs at paqe 491 of the Appendi:{,
"a well-organized and full-factual analysis of the clinical
and other investigational data he is prepared ~o orove i~
support of his opposition to the notice of opportunity for a
hearing.

A request for a hearina may not rest upon mere

allegations or denials, but must uet "o:rth spec:.fic facts
showing rhat there:~ a genuine and substant,al issuG of fact
that requires a hear:ng.

When it clearly appears fror. the

data in the application and from the reasons and factual
analysis in the request for the hearing that the:.:e is no
genuine and substantial issue of fact which preclucles the
refus-,1 to approve the application or the withdra··al of
approval of the applicent, that is, no adequate and wellcontrolled clinical investigations to support the claims cf
effectiveness which have been idencified, the Commissioner
will enter an order on this data, making findings and
conclusions on such data."
Now, the Commissioner wrote to llynson and advised
them of the new regulations and asked them to make a new submission in conformity with the requirements of the regulations.
Hynson made a further submission, after it had lost the

66
district court action .
I

In this subroission it made three contentions to the
Commissioner, which are here before you in these pet"tion ano
cross-petition here.
First, it contended that L\1trexin i::: today
generally recognized as both safe and effective anr ther~forc
not a new drug and not within the regulatory juris iction of
the Commissioner.
Secondly, it contended that bcca ,e ~utrexin · a,
generally recogni~ed as safe in October 1962, :twas exem tee
under Section 107(c) (4) of the 196' arnendrnonts.
Thirdly, it contended that in fact there ~as .~bsta~tial evidence to support Lutrexin' s cl aims of effect.iv r,ess.
The Commissioner reviewed the material submitteo by
Hynson, and he rejected, he refused a hearinq on all three
of these issues.
On review, the Court of Appeals reversed.

It

purported not to question the validity of the Commissioner's
regulations defining what would constitute or qualify as
substantial evidence, and not to question the regulations
providng for a hearinq only when therr is a qenuine and
substantial is~ue of fact regarding whether such evidence
exists.
Nevertheless, it hPld that the material suLmitted
by Hynson was suf4'icie:nt to raise a qc,nuinc issue as tn the

67

drug's effectiveness.

It dismjssed the Commissioner ' s

evaluations of the studies, which he ha<l carefully made in
his order, noting that while tt-is wa& perhaps valid, it war.
the kind of thing that should onlv be done afte4 a hearin~.
QUESTIOU:

Mr. Frey, th£' Co..un s">.i.one::'s regulation~

dealing with t.he existence of. qrounds eor summary il•"'.qmenl,
do they, as interpreted, exclude only t~e pos~ibility oe an
evidentiary hearing in such a situatiol' , or do they a!so
excluc.e the possibility of: oral arqume-:':?

'

MR. FREY:

Well, I'm no-c c~tain.

Norro;1lly, the

pLocecure is designed to give th~ manufacturer a full
opportunity to submit any data he has to be con:.::idered.
No-:~, I think that -- well, let

,n-;,

just see.

I'm advisej that if there were a request for oral
presentation with regard to these matters, it would be hearc
before the Bureau of Drugs and not ht the Conmissioner
persoually.

The Bureau of Drugs beinq an administrative arm

which reviews the medical issues involved.
QUESTION:

So the manufacturer, then, could have

had an oral argument at least before the Bureau of Druqs, -MR. FREY:

I think --

QUESTION:

-- although he miqht have been precluded

from offering any evidence?
MR. FREY:

That's correct.

A11d in addition , if the

manufacturer felt that the Commissioner's order withdrawing

68

approval of tre NDA for Lutrexi.n was erronEous because he ha~
in fact identified coroc studie$ th1t micrht quali~y ~s
and

de ua

well-controlled, he could have petitic.~cd for reconsider< -

tion and pointed out that the order was defective ana there
here, indeed, is sornetl:-ing that warrants a hearin'l, which
you've overlooked.
Qt.:ESTION: But that t'OUld tave been uub~cquently

MR. FREY:

Well, the --

QUESTION:

That he had located the evi~ence in the

,meanwhile , he couldn ' t

qo

back in on the sam~ stuff he had

before and get any more than he did the first time.
MR. FREY: Well , one of th,. isr.ues here is the
complajnt by the 'industry that somehow maybe the manufacturer
doesn•~ know what it is th~t the Corrurissioner is drivin

at

vhen he is goinq to withdrow approval of the ND.II.

he

Mayb

cloesn' t kn0\1 what the C'ommissioner finds to be wrong, and the
Commissioner ought to have the burden of cominq forward with
some explanation of why he's withdrawinq approval.

And with

respect to that contention, we don't think that ha~ any merit,
but certainly by the time he isaues his order withdrawing
approval he has explained his qrounds for finding Hynoon's
materiel unacceptable .
And if there is somethinq wrong with those qrounds,
whic

I've yet to hcdr anybocy indicate in any concrete termG,

69

there would be an opportunity to go back to the C'omrr,issioner
and say, You've made a mistake.
QUESTION:

Well, you say you coul<'l get oral arqumer-t

and argue with the Commission as to whether or not the
material submitted did comply before th~ 13urcau of Druqs?
MR. FREY:

Yes, I think that t:·,ere were req\1 sts.

QUES'l'ION:

You could

No, on the contrary, you =~ld certainly

Like lawyers do.

A,1d like parties do, to hac,,e their interest

MR. FREY: The difficulty is to get into the nature

of the issue,

I think that Food and Drug woulo try to shap~

a proceeding, assume that ther.e were ~ome issu

to be resolv,:;.l,

my understanding of the procedure that they woulc consiaer
would be to establish a p<1nel of indep_nd..,nt, non-agency
people to resolve the factual question; that i ,, prominent
scientists vho are kno,·rledgeable in the pa:r: t · cular area.
And I suppose that there is a proh'em .:.n the serse
that what they're saying, You'ro net fiqhtirn

'.lS,

yoi1're not

putting somebody --· you' re not cross-examining our \Fi tr,es:-es,
and you're not putting soinebocy on the stand to say what's
wrong with our studies.

And

of course, at this staqe of the

proceeding, what the Commissioner has done is he's looked at
the studies and he's said, Here is a whole bunch of things
tnat are wrong on their face.
QUESTION:

What you're saying is that you're doing

That is, nobody said, We want some more, you're wrong, we hav

some opportlnity to t,:,lk to somebody about it.

I'I!? just not

that issu.

But I don't think we get any11. er

near that in th's

QUESTION: But your whole sumrn«ry judqment p:-:-ocedur-~,
in accord, although it's premised exactly on the type of
reasoning you use, the judge doesn't sinply say, I've derio~d

So.."lleone Makes a

argue as to whether there is o, is n.:,t

&

subs.:antial

issue,

issue of fact .
MR, FREY:

t·lell, but this is ar adrainistrati ve

proceeding, and the Commissioner is not the adversary of
this party.

I mean, he ls not setting out to tal~e these drug<

off the market,

What he is doing is setting out to enforce

the congressional mandate that has been imposed upon him.
He has a duty to foster the distribution of useful drugs
as well as a duty to take ineffective ones off t·~e market.
He is not an adversary in the sense that in a judicial summar}
judgment proceeding you have parties A and B, who have
conflicting interests with one another and who are fiqhting
one another .
Now, here
QUESTION:

As soon as the FDA disagrees with an

76

applicant, then the applicant viaws hirn as an adversary .
MP. FREY:

Yes .

It's underst3.nd.i½le U,at Hynson

would view the CollUllissioner in so:ne rea::. - nse a~
because he has the power to take a~tion

h'c~

a<'lver iar , ,

is adver~

to

their interests .
But it seems to me pcrf ctly re~~onable ror him to
say that statute -- Congress impo ,c the stand1.1rr,
imposed the standard of sub:::tnntial ev.i.nonce. Tr·

nc< it
is an

objective , scicnti~ic stand ra, and hi~ rnqula ion~ implcmc,t
this standard and set out the criteria, a.~a it c vt lnly iG
reasonable to ask the manufacturer to come in and ma~e

QUESTION:

Is there somu parallel h re,

~l .

rcy,

possibly between this situati~n and Section 225, where a
district judge may dispense uith ah arinq if he finds that
it conclus1',ely appearc on the face of the record that ther, '
nothing to have a hearing about?
MF, FREY:

Is it something like that?

No, I don't think I would c;o that far,

because normally in a 2255 , the judge has sorro prior experience,
the issues may have been previously litigated before the judg
QUESTION:

But you believe it ' s practical , trat the

M. FREY: \ell, thy have fil a wrat th~y hav

to s,y

77

in support of the merits of the drug, and the Commissioner
has looked at it.
QUESTION: And you're saying that th• Secrelary, the
FDA can say, There is nothing here on the face cf what you have
submitted that requires us to have any '1eari11
IIR. FREY:

at all?

Absolutely. l·nd this ls an:!. o ous to

summary judgment, except that it doesn't. 'lave ti· ia adversary
procedure and therefore -- that ir,

it doesn't have an

active lawyer advoc«te/adverscry, and therefore, in th,.t
respect, it• s somewhat different fro,n the ii:.di.ci l summ ry
judgment.
But it stjll, I think, even in the case of a

FDA'.s regulatory problem uns.
It reviewed those 4,000 or son

\I

rug

pplic t.ions

that had been filed between 1938 and 19G2, and th t were for
products that we:re still being recirl:etcd, and the national
J\cademy of Sciences submitted reco=endations and reports
showing that there were scmewhere between 12 and 13 thousand
clai s that appeared not to be supported by substantial
evidence of effectiveness.
Now, if any significant proportion of t~c manufactu

rc.

of drugs makinq ttenc claims asked for full dress evidentiary
hearings, e&ch of which coul~ last two, three, four months,
just in order to keep their product on che ~~rket until FDA
could net, the mission of withdrawing ine

market would he totally sabotaged; it t1ould simply be
impossible for the agency to deal with this.
And I think a question that was asked earlier in the
argument, there are 24 lnwycrs available to enforce the Food
and Drug laws: that's court actions and administrative
proceedings.

That i~ the size of the gentiral counsel's offic-3

at f'ood and on,g.
Now, tho way that the agency respo.1ded to this
problem, and the rea:on it was al>J.c to res")ond this way was
that there was in the statute an objective standard, which
~aid if yoi:. don't have adequate and 1•1011-controlled investigations, you cnn't stay on the mark£>t.
So the Commissioner adopted w~at, tn effect, is a
screening procedure.

Ho said to the ,nanufacturer:

With regard to this clinical testing,

MR. FREY:

It's certainly for a new compound that

QUESTION: 'On the basis of new info mation before

you simply don't have the kind of evidence that Congress

minu e

at the Appe~dix, at page 103, none of the materials that
Hynson submitted has anybody ever suggested could possibly
constitute adequate

nd woll-controll~d inve tigations, excep

for the Majewski and Jennings studies and the Grnttor study,
Tho. Is thre

89

Now , if you look at the .'-'ajewski and Jennings study,
which starts at page 99, he sets up to study the ability of
Lutrexin to halt contractions, and he comes up with a
statistic as to the number of people in wnom the contructions
were halted,

He never compares that with anybody or anything,

there is simply no crnnparison whatsoever.

There's obviously

no way to toll whether Lutrexin halted the contraction, .
For all 11c know fro.~ this study, contractions spontan ously
halt at the sa:ne rate.
That's what I mean by the 1ack o~ a controlled,
uid that's what the Commissioner meant.
Now , if you look at page 103, he had 88 patients

in his study group,

All 88 of these patients qave birth

prematurely, according to this study .
Now, does this study demonstrate that Lutrexin is
effective to stop prematurity?
He has no statistical analysis of this Table 4, at
the top of 103: no showing that there's any s iq,1ificant
difference, statistically different between qroup II and
group I,
He then goes down to Table 5, he co pares the 88
patients who were treated with Lutrexin
QUESTION:

and you compare that against the regulations , I think it is
clear that the study does not como close to complying , and

that there is ainply no way that it could be salvaqed or

If this kind of material is sufficient to rcouire
the Commissioner to hold an evidentiary hearing , then anythir
is.

Because this is just grossly inadequate .

There simply i

QUESTION: Let me ask you again, wh twas the other

MR. FREY:

Well, I think it's not exactly clear.

And I think they have not really come forwaLd and said, Look,
the COllll1lissioner is urong because here is the factual issue.
What factual issue?
The only factual issue that they have suggested is
11hether historical controls are appropriate.

And since it's

quite clear on the face that even if historical controls
were theoretically appropriate , these are not historically
controlled studie~.

An~

I don't believe that they have

suggested that they are historically controlled studied,
I'm not clear what the hearing would be about.
Presumably they would put Dr. Majewski and Dr.
Gratton on the stand and have them try to explain what they
were doing·in their studies and what the results were.

But

if they don't say anything more than they have here -QUESTION: What did the court think the hearing would

Not at all. They are com,le~ely

study.

If the doctor says that these people got multivitamins, tl'<'y
?

got delalutin, they got DES, in addition to oetting Lutrexin,
that appears on the face of the stuoy.

There isn't anything

to hold a hearing about.
These patients received concomitant medication, you
can't attribute whatever results were obtained to Luttexin .
That's what the rcqulations say.
QUESTION: But might it not be at least possible that
Dr. Majewski, having set up these stu•i<'s, would have so. e
defense for them?
R. FREY:

I th'nk it's inconceivahle.

Inf c, it'

93

clear that the Majewski, for instance the '68 r•ajewski study
is not even a study.

It's a collection of his experience ovc~

the preceding ten years.

He went hack to his files and pullel

requirements.

ob-jectivc

These st1dies simply are mi es, 1-qht vc~rs

,,way from meeting these requirements.
I think I, i.n view of the time, woulcl like to rrove
on to another point, if there are no further questions on
this point.
I'd like to turn to the question which was touched
upon earlier and which involves the correctness of the
Commissioner's denial of a hearing on the question of
whether Lutrexin is today generally recognized as safe and
effective, and therefore not a new druq, and therefore not
subject to this regulatory jurisdiction.
What the Con-missioner said was if there is no
substantial evidence of effectiveness, if there isn't the kind
of scientific evidence that Congress said was required, then
these qualified experts, that Section 20l(p) talks about,
couldn't possibly arrive at the concl1,sion that the drug is

94

effective .

They

could not have that qencral recocmitLon of

effectiveness, because it would be based or th

pr cise kind

of unscient~fic clinical impression$, uncc trolle~ stucies,
the very kind of thing that Conqrcss had b

Mr. Chief Jur,tice,

1ey

it please

the C:>urt:
I've heard so much, I don't kno~ whore to beq~n.
There's been a 000d deal of talk about the NAS/NPC
report, ..-his National Research Council report, which evaluate
a nl.llllber of drugs for the Food and Drug Administration.

The

conclusions of those panels were, in many cases, and certainly

'

in the case of Lutrexin, as the Court o-F Appeals for the
District of Columbia recently said in the USV ca1·e,
conclusory and cryptic.

l'hey certainlv were that in the

case of Lutrexin.
In fact, out of the 14 studies which we eventually
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, the NAS/NPC,
insofar as its report shows, considered only four.
Now, there has been considerable talk about whether
the issue here is the existence of adequate and well-controll~d
studies.

QUESTION: Could I ask you first, is it your understanding of (e) (3) that the Commissioner is authorized to set
aside an NDA if there's a lack of substantial evidence of

96

effectiveness and safety, and that he may put the burden on
you to submit evidence, to submit that substantial cvid~nce?
MR. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

No, Bir.

May I --

llhat do you say, No, that i

not yoJr

understandinq?
MR. WILLIAl'.S:
way:

No .

No.

May I approach it this

The issue iw not, as has been sug~estcd in the withdraw l

proceeaing under that section which you cited, wh tt r there
are adequate and well-controlled studies, that is, sub tantia
evidence to support ~ie effectiveness o

the druq.

Tflc issue is, under these regulation

which arc

alleged by FDl\ to follow the ,;unllllary jurqlll<'nt p:ro
the Rules of Civil Procedure, whether u ~c

dur

t ose

of
1 t£ons

there is a material, an issue of material fact raised by the
evidence before the Commissioner.
QUESTION: Well,

let me put it to you this way:

Let's assume that the commissioner docs give you a hcarinq.
lie asks you to submit evidence, he says, I think that i

a

question about this drua, and he ask you to submit evidence
and you submit none, for example.

May he then withdraw the

NOA without making any finding other than that there is a
failure to produce any evidence?
MR. WILLI/\MS:

It is our view, sir, that under the

summary judgment practice, in other agencies ao well a

1n th

courts, that he must at least put forth prima facic cvid nee

97

to show that he'z got a basis for sayin,;

Well, that's a little uit in COl"flict,

isn't it, with the idea that Congress h s very broad power to
set up hurdles to any druq qettinq on the market; is it not?
MR. WILLIAMS:

I don't see why t e necessity of

showing there is no issue of material fact before the
Commissioner is fertile -QUESTION:

Hell, if I understood your response

correctly, Mr. Williams, it was that you have a drug on the
market, and this question arises, and you say that you need
bear no burden at all in response to this question, this issu_
being raised, and if you default in trar1itional terms, the
FDA must assume the role that a plaintiff assumes in default
case and pro·,e something?
MR. WILLIAMS:

It must assume the same rule under

its own regulations, which -QUESTION: What specific requlation do you rely on?

report o"' th_ ho.:.rd o

that -- the scientific commission, about Lut_exin, for
example, if he just says, Here is what I have, J-ocre is the
report I have.

Would that be a prima f~cie case for him, as

far as you're concerned?
MR, WILLIAMS:

It might in some cases, hut in the

case of Lutrexin they didn't even consider all the materials.
Now, we of course must deny, and do so at lenqth

in our briefs, that there were not historical. controls used
by Dr. Majewski and Dr. Gratton in their four studies.
We consider them historical controls.

Our briefs analyzed

and attempted to show that they are.

And as for their not

having concomitant medication necessarily excluded, naturally
they were.
But Dr. Gratton, who did use concomitant medication,
found that with that concomitant medica'l:ion without Lutrexin
he lost far more babies than with Lutrexin.

Therefore, he

concluded, Lutre:<in had some effect because he was using as
controls patients whom he knew were at attendance at the
premature labor or were in premature labor or had previously

100

aborted or had previously gone through premature labor.
So that we must look at these thing~ direct'y, and
in that connection I should like to refer to the government
reply brief, on page 29, in footnotes 33 and 34, it cites
?

?

reports by Hinsworth and Deakman as exa~plEs

well-controlled studies of a drug uEcd to tr at cases of
threatened and habitual abortion.

These studies are alleged to stand ir stark contra~t

ely,

in the first place, in neither study, the Hinsworth or L'eal:ma1

Gratton studies.

Hynson ' s, treatment of patients with histori s of prior

in imminent

danger of premature delivery or abortion; all of the ~•«je\,ski
and Gratton cases did.
They cannot, therefore, -- that is, these submitted
by the government in its reply brief at the last minute -which we had never seen, by the way.

They c~nnot, therefore,

be compared with HW&D's investigation, where a hiqh risk of
the fetal mortality existed.

In such a case, the use of the

double-blind placebo type study uould be unethical accordj_nq
to Drs. Rezek, Gratton, Majewski and l\llen.

Allen, being a m~mber of the panel of Nl\S/NRC, which
evaluated Lutrexin.
It was his opinion, stated in a no~arized doc.iment
to us, that Lutrexin should not be taken off the market, that
they never had any such intention.
Now, I should think it might help if I listed the
issues which I think are in these two cases.
In 72-394, which involves primarily the hearing
issue , the questions are:

whether Hynson is entitled to a

hearing on the question of whether there is substantial
evidence of safety and efficacy as distinguished from a
hearing on the jurisdictional questions, which I shall refer
to.
Secondly, whether the new May 1970 regulations,

106
which are in the back part of the Appendix, under which a
hearing was denied, are valid as applied to FDA by FDA to
Lutrexin.
And, finally, whether HW&D, llynson's, right to a
hearing, vested under the former r qula ·ons which preced d
these, when Hynson accepted the offer o"' a hearinc, by lett r
to the Food and Drug Administration.
In No. 72-414, which is in ~UPPC'rt of -- in

filed a brief in support of th
quection is:

cross-

ch

it or, the ba"iC

whether the Court of Appe.ls

s ri ht in its

conclusion that the Coll1!1lissiorer was unautlorized initi !1
to determine his own jurisdiction un~er Sec in 201(p), th
definition of new drugs.
That is, \1hether the druq, Lutrexin, is generally
recognized

s cafe and effective under the Act as am nded in

1962; whether it was deemed approved under Section 107(c) (2)
of the Act.

If it was, it is not subject to administrative

withdrawal proceedings under Section 505(c).
Three, whether the drug was exempt from the
effectiveness requirements of Section l07(cl (4), the so-cal le
grandfather clause.

If so, then it ic our view that none of

the effectiveness provisions of the statute are applicabl

to

that drug.
There has been considerable discussion of the matte
of general recoqniticn of safety anc effectiveness.

Anc,

s

10·,
understand the government's position, ana I think I do understand it, they maintain that general recognition of safety
and effectiveness, which is the test of new druq status,
is dependent upon the exi~tence of substantial ev~dence of
effectiveness e.s defined in the 1962 amend:nents in an
entirely dU:ferent &ection of the statute, not the c,ovc.raqe
section in S0S(d).
And that, in effect, the substanti~l evieencc
definition is a part of Section 20l(nl, and tre1e is no real
difference between a determination of new drug status and a
determination of whether the druq is safe anl effective .
MR. CHIEF JUS'l'ICE BUFGEP: Would you keep vour
voice up a little bit, Mr. Williams.
MR. WILLIAMS:

Sorry.

No~, it so happens that 20l(n) wasn't even amended
when this definition of substantial evidence was placed,
written into Section 505(dl, the substantial evidence
definition.
Section 20l(n) -- (pl, the definition of new
drugs, was amended in 1962 only to include the requirement
of effectiveness in the definition of new drugs, not the
requirement of substantial evidence of effectiveness.
Section 20l(p) is a jurisdictional test which
governs the application of Section 505.
QUESTION:

What do you say the ~tandard is, the

lOC

standard of proof on effectiveness?
MR. WILLIAMS:

General recoqnition o~ saf~~y and

effectivenecs amon~ experts.

Th~t•s specif'ed in th

!-lR. WILT,IAMS:

could be general recognition o~ effectiveness or of saf ty,

obligations of its manufacture may be.

Now, the right to a hearing on the question of
substantial evidence .

The briefs of the government in the;e

cases place great if not primary emphas.:.s upon the alln1ec
incapacity of. FDA to administer Section 505,
1962 .

a..i,ended in

If the anticipated demands for hearinqs, tat ie the

hearings anticipated by the government, and

I

ithorawal

proceedings had to be met by the agency.
We explain, however, in our brief in No. 72-294,
beginning at page 33, that only if there is an issue of
material fact need a hearinq be granted by the Food and Drug
Aoministration .
In the case of an application for approval of the
drug, as di tinguishcd from the question of ~hether it'd
generally recognized as safe and effect,ve, in the case of
such an application it is expressly provided in the statute
that if the applicant accepts an opportunity for a hearing
within thirty days of notice of such opportunity, such
hearing shall commence not more than ninety days after the
expiration of such thirty days, unless the Secretary and the
applicant otherwise agree.
That is explicit ,

I don't see how an ex parte

decision , such as was made in this case, denyinq a hearing,
could be made under such a provision .
The right to a hearing in a withdrawal proceeding
must be no less firm, both as I read the statute and as I read

110
the legislative history.

In fact, Senator Eastland expressly

stated, in explaining this withdrawl provision to the Senate,
and I quote:

"Withdrawl of approval of a new drug applicatio1

would be preceded by a hearing • • . with findin son
tho basis of the record."
That's rather explicit.

Certui1ly, in th

ituat·

where , as I think we show in our briefs, the likelihoo1 of
ov~rpowering n'Ull'bcr of r quir d h arirq

is no good reason for dispensing with th~ rninL ure r qui e cnt
of a hearing in an adjudicatory matter.
The cases are cited in our brief in No. 394, and
they include the Ohio Bell Telepho.!!£ case and th~ Wonq Yang Sun1
case.

That's at pages 37 and 38.
So, despite the express fears of the govern=nt of

multiplicity of hearings, we think it is safe to say that the
necessary showing of the existence of a material fact, and tr t
is all that hao to be shown, will drastically curb ever th
tendency to request ouch hearings the government fears, based
on speculation not o~ evidence.

In any event, we beli ve we

have shown in our brief in No. 394 that an issue of material
fact exists with respect to the efficacy of Lutrexin.
We do not deny that Section 70l(n) of the Act
authorizes the Food an

Druq Administration

o make qc~eral

111
rules for its enforcement.

Obviously, it does.

Such

regulations have the status of law, if they are reason&ble and
in accordance with tae statute .
The new d:cug regulations of May 8, 1970, to which
we referree earlier, relating to substantial evidence of
effectiveness and the right to a hearinq, \'ere issued under
Section 70l(a) to implement the definit:.on of new drug in
Section 20l(pl and the definit.ion in Section so;;, the
operative new drug section.
It is those regulations with ,;..hich these cases are
concerned, not the regulations published in the Federal
Register of May 21, 1972, for classification of ovez-thecounter drugs as to their new drug status.

We do not

consider those OTC drugs are valid, because they represent an
attempt to circumvent the provisions of Section 505 of the
Act by a classification system instead of by the adjudication
procedure contemplated by that section.

But they are not

before the Court today in any event .
The Storer Broadcasting case, which is cited by the
government in support of its proposition that a rule can
always be substituted for adjudication, did not circumvent a
basic statutory provision, such as Section 505 .

'T'he relatively

simple ownership rule, station ownership rule there involved
could be readily applied , and did not concern a variety of
different articles or drugs or stations with different

11~

labeling and different characteristics, as this Court
recognized in Securities and Exchange

C

rnmission _y_ _. C_!ienery .

The problam may be so specialized and varrini in nstur

as to

be impossible of capture within the bound r~ s of th

Our basic position with res

~t

o the

ay l 70

regulations is this:
First, as they have been applied to Hyn
Lutrexin, they're invalid.

n'

drug,

Because the commissioner r fu ed

recognize that the evidence submitted by Hynson rai e
substantial issue of mt

o

a

ial fact as to whether there is

a substantial evidence of effectiveness of Lutrc
failed to produce prima facic evidence

o th

n.

An~

con rary.

Under ~uch circumstances, ah arinq is r
the statute, we sub:!lit, bofor., the Comm ~~ion r

uired by

ay legally

withdraw ap roval of the druq under Section 501(el (3) on the
ground of lack of substantial evidence.
Under the swnmary judgment rule of t>ie RCP, as t've
said, upon which these FDA rules are allegedly patterned, it
is clearly the burden of the proponent to show, by priloa
facie evidence, that there is no issue of material fact
pres nted by such evidence.
Moreover, under that rule, the oppo inq party is
entitled to depose or exlll11ine the witnesses of the other part.
[ti

clea

that, aside fron the burden of

r of

113
rules in the summary judgment procedures, the Administrative
Procedure Act requires that FDA, as the proponent of the order,
shoulder the burden of proof to show a lack of substantial
evidence; and this it did not oo.
Also, this is clear from the lanquuqe of Section ~OS.
The second basic objection to t~e May 1970 requlclti n
is that they combine in the Commissioner both the prosecutor' 1
function and the judging function,
We recognize that the Commissioner must make the
eventual and final decision as to whether a drug should be
withdrawn, but it is unfair, we think, to provide for an ex
parte decisior. by the Commi~sioner without the submission by
him of any evidence whatsoever to rebut the stud~es and
affidavits of the distinguished obstetricians and qynecoloqis~s
which Hynson, Westcott and Dunning presented.
QUESTION: Well, even if you had had all sorts of

witnesses in an evidentiary hearing, the Commissioner still
would have been prosecutor and judge, wouldn't he?

I mean,

that wouldn't have chanqed that,
MR, WILLIAMS:

can do it more briefly that -- well , I did say , if you ' ll

in 1941, one way to eliminate the possibility of unfairness

that matter, is to have an impartial judge do the original

The fifth and final case in these consolited
proceedings is USV Pharmaceutical Corporation aqainst Weinberqer·.
This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit and, like CIBA and Bentex, it arose as a
civil action in the district court for a declaratory judqment,
that the products involved are not new c,rugs es

efinec1 by .t .

Act.
The issues in the USV case involve solely the
interpretation of the grandfather clause in the 1962
ments, Section 107(c) (4).

all'

nd-

The district court hel~ that the

products involved do enjoy grandfather status, and the Court
of Appeals held that they do not.
Now, before proceeding to the specifics of this
case, perhaps it would be helpful to step back for a moment
and look at the over-all statutory scheme which we've been
discussing, since ten o'clock this morning.
There has been some imprecise use of terms during
the course of the arguments and, with the Court's permission,
I should like to briefly restate some of the fundamental
principles with which

WE

are confronted.

There are only two relevant terms used in the
statute of all those shorthand expressions that have been
brought up today.

As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, the

term "old drug" does not appear in the statute.

There are

only two terms. The terms are "drug" and "new drug", both of

118

these are specifically defined in the Act.

And for present

purposes, we need not qet into the details of the definition of
"drug" generally .
We can just assume that this refers to uhat we
normally think of as druqs.
But the term "new drug" is explicitly defin d.
special class of drugs is carved out, cs defined by Section
20l(p) of the Act, and this has been so since 191fl.
the Act regulates all druqs.

So that

It regulates druqs generally in

a certain manner, and it regulates new drugs in a very specif .c
manner.
This scheme is described in the hrief for t"i
Proprietary Association, which is the thick, light green brie ,
at pages 4 to 9, and also in the PMA brief, which is the thic,
dark green brief, at pages 28 to 29.

Rather than repeat what is said there, .et me simpl
summarize:
In 1938, the basic Food and Oruq Act, the Pure Food
and Drug Act of 1906, was totally revamped to strengthen the
authority of the Food and Drug Administration, to protect the
public in the field of drugs.

This obviously is true.

But tho powers of the Food and Drug Admiristration
were strengthened very largely by way of increasinq their
authority as an enforcement agency, a prosecutor, if you will,
in the district courts.

The hasic statutory scheie, which

119

applies to the regulation of drugs contemplates that the
substantive prohibitions of the Act will be enforced in civil
or criminal actions brought in the name of the Unitea States
on the reference of the Food and Druq Jldministration in t!1e
district courts.
So that if the drug is misbranded, the remedy
available to the government is a civil action to seize the
product or for an injunction or criminal p~osecution.
If the drug is adulterated, the same remec1ies are
available:

a civil action for seizure or for an injunction

or a criminal prosecution.
The Food and Drug ldministration has no direct
authority,with an exception that r will refer to in a few
moments, to directly enforce these prohibitions.

As was

pointed out in response to a question of Mr. Justlce
Rehnquist, the agency has no cease anr desist order authority,
this is not the Federal Trade Commission; ·::his is an Execu·tiv..l
Branch agency, which refers cases to the Department of
Justice for prosecution or for the initiation of civil actions.
Nor, for that matter, does the aqency have subpoena
power in the proceedings it does conduct.

This has been

recently pointed out in a study by the Administrative
Conference, which characterizes FDA as perhaps the most
important agency in the government which does not have any
subpoena power.

120
So the agency that Conqress strenqther.ecl in 1°38,
just to repeat it once more, is essentially a pol cirq
with regard to drugs, except with regard
specifically defined by the statut~.

NON, in 1938, when this statute was first enacted,

the word "effective" did not appear.

l\

clruq was recrnrded as a

new drug if it was not generally recoqnizec'I as sa•e for its
intended use, its effectiveness did not enter into the matter.
The determination, however, whetlier a

roduct was

generally recognized as safe is a factu l determination ard
was then a factual detemination as to the state of in•ormcd
expert opinion on the product.
The question, in short, was not whether the drug was
in fact safe, because it might in fact be safe but not be
generally recognized as safe; the question was whether the
consensuse of informed expert opinion was that the product
was safe. And in the absence of such a consensus, the product
would be classified as a new drug.
In 19- -QUESTION:

l·lhen you speak of this "informed expert

opinion", this is that category that is generally the general
reputation of the druq as distinguished from evidence coming
from controlled tests; is that correct?
MR. l!OFFMJl.tl: That is correct, with a qualification,
that I would like to state at this time.
There has been a great deal of discussion as

~v

whether you have to have substantial evioence as defined in
the statute in 1962, that is controlled clinical studies, to
have general recogniti~n, the qovernment says that you do.

122
The companies in these cases a~gue, uniformly I believe, that
you do not need to have it.

But if the government is riqht,

that an expert couldn't possibly come to a conclusion ns to
the safety of the product without controlled clinical stuclie
or, for that matter, its effectiveness, then there won•~ be
a consensus.
QUESTION:

It isn • t a question

to a conclusion, it's whether h

can co

I

to a corrc t

conclusion, isn't that what thi& 1962 Act is all about?
MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the 1962 Act de ines subst ntial
evidence in terms of control.led clinical studies

l.

h regard

to the application of the standards for approval or di~approval by FDA.
As Mr. Williamo pointed out, this definition does
not in terms apply to the question of genP.ral recoqnition for
purposes of classifyinq tt,e drug in the first inotance.

But

the statute does not say that tloe experts' consensus has to be
a correct one, viewed from thP vantage point of FDA or
anybody else.

The test i.s whether there is a conscr, uo.

Now, if the government is right, that substantial
evidence, in the statutory sense, of effectiveness und r th
new otatute, or under the ola statute -- to which I'd like to
return in a moment -- whether there is a consensus an to
su',stantial evidence of safety, if that depends on whether
there are controlled clinical studies, then there won't b~ a

121
consensus, because if the government is riqht the experts
simply won't come to a conclusion, if they arc really qualified
experts.

It may be that thPy will come to that concluslon

notwithstanding the absence o 9 studies.
Now, the presence of ,;tudie~ may he relevant 'to an
expert in deci dinq that he do.-s or he c!ocsn' t recogr izc tt,e

nut the statute doe;n't tell the e~pert on what

basis he has to decide for the purpose of the consensus.
QOES'l'ION: nut he does have to make t!-" controlled
study?
MR. HOFFilAN: The statute requires a controlled
study, Mr . Justice Marshall, -QUESTION: ,'iell, I -~R. HOFFMAN:

only if a product is a new druq,

as defined by the statute, and is therefore required to get
premarketing clearance.

Because if the druq is not a new

drug -QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said that you didn't

You do agree with that for a new drug?

MR . HOFFMAN: For a new drug only, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

You agree to that?

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, I do .

124

QUESTION:

Now, what is your definition of a new

drug, the statute's definition?
MR. HOFFlll\N: The clefinit.'..on is -:.he stat t<-' s
definition, -,hich is that a proc1uct -- ,;.n 1962 -

up •mtil

1962, the definition of a new drug was a product which is not

generally recognized by qualified experts as safe ~or its
intended uses.

Products which \/.:?re generally reccqnize as

safe did not require preclcarancc and did not have to go
through the nett drug pro-:edure.
QUESTIOII: 1\nd after the '62 Act?
MR. IIOFFllllN: After the- '62 1,ct, if the prcduct was
generally recognized as safe, but not generally reccqnized as
effective, then it wac a new drug.

What we're --

QUESTION: And subject to the controllcc test?
MR. HOFFMAN:

That's correct.

Now, the change in definition of now druq, so as to
expand that category, to expand thP. scope of the adminilllrative
regulatory scheme, that amendment would, in the absence of some
grandfather clause, have applie<'! ocross the bonrd to all
products that were on the market in 1962 .
Congress
goal wou::.d have done.

anc! that is what the originol Kefauver
Congress did not, however, enact the

original Kefauver bill in thot respect.

It added transitional

prov sions, and it adde~ a qrandfather provision.
And thr. precise irsLe in this case is the ecope of'

125
the grandfather provision, so that it c~n be determined
whether or not a pre-' 62 product · s to he classi ,'icd as a
new drug or not as a new drug, according to the n

•-1

definition or the old definition.
P rhaps it woula be helpful, just for a moment, to
state the factual origins of the controversy presented in this
particular case.
For many years, beginning in 1955, USV, the
petitioner in this case, has marketed a line of products
principally containing a substance called citrus flavonoid
compound.

This is a naturally occuring c;o,nb ,.nation of

substances, called bioflavonoids, which are c'!erived from
citrus fruits.

And the recommended use of the products is

the control of abnormal capillary perme.:ihility and fraqility,
which is a condition of the capillary wall sometimes found
in conjunction with serious ailments involving bleeding.
This side condition results,when it is present, in
excessively easy rupture of the tiny capillary blood vessels·
which lie near the surface of the skin or near internal
surfaces, and USV's citrus flavonoid products are recommended
to physicians only as an aid in strengthening the capillary
wall,

In that sense, they are a prescription product, they

are promoted for this use to physicians only, although they
are available without a prescription, if you went in and asked
for CVP, for example, you could get it, but there would be

12,
nothing on the box to tell you th~t this is what it was 000d
for.

The promotion is only to physicians .
The products in the line of pro~ucts in quer.tion fa•1

into two separate groups .

The ori~indl products in th€' ljne

were new drugs, as defined by the statute in 1955, then they
were first introduced for this u e, ~or ahnom.l • pill ry
pE!rmcability and fragility.

And USV th refoz

Now, by new drug applicetion, r al~o

an what has

another term that doesn't app~ar in the statute,

nd in

response to ~lr. Justice Stewart's quo tion of thi

r.iorn1.nq, I

would say that the term "new c!ruq applicatio"

NDA does

mean new drug application, it does not roe n new druq approval.
It doesn't appear anywhere in the statute, this acronym.
The utatute talks about applications, applications under S ct1on
505, it does not talk about NDA's.
I have not personally heard of any u~c of the
acronym to refer to a new drug approval until the Court of
Appeals opinion in the Bentex case.

I t-.hink that mo~t member

of the Food and Drug bar would be ,urprised to lenrn that it
refers to sotncthinq else.
The co:nmon undcratnndinq of NOA is "new drug
application".
do ~n•t tal

But the important point is that the statute
about N'l1\'s, w1'ntever NOA r:,eans, it talk

about

127

applications.

So, at least for my pttrposes, when I use the

abbreviation, r. am referring to the aoplication, the new druq
application.
After the new drug applications fi!ed by USV had
become effective for the original products in this line, and
the products covered

by

them had become aenerally recognizee

as safe for their recornrn,;inded use, so that they. 1ere no lone r
new dx ugs for that use, as defined bt the .;tatu·ce, USV
introducdd two additional products of the .;ar.ie type.

New

additions of old drugs, such as these two, are usually called
111P-too products.
in the statute.

That's another term that doesn't appear
It's a shorthand term.

And it has some

perjurative connotations that were perhaps intended by those
who developed the term, but I think today it has no such
connotation.
Me-too products are competing productg, competitive
products; they are brought out on the market after a so-calle~
pioneer product has been on the market sufficiently long so
that drugs of this type become generally recognize~ as safe.
These two products were never the subject of new
drug applications,
for them.

The manufacturer never filed an application

They were simply brought out as drugs not new

drugs, or as old drugs, if you will.

There was no new drug

application filed for them, no new drug application became
effective for them.

They were never regulated as new drugs

12P
by the Food and Drug Adroinistration.

They were en the Market

as old drugs, just like aspirin.
These products were generally recognized a,; svf'c f'c,
their recorn ended use, and that's the bai:is on which t

y rer,

brought on the market.
QUESTIO?I:

MR. HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:

What if they had no

f ecth eness at al ?

If they had no effectiveness -How would the

f the FDA concluded

that they were totally ineffective, how, in your view, do th<'y
address themselves to that problem in the public interest?
MR.

HOFFMAN:

The FOA coulc'I recommend to the Depart1.1e,1 t

of Justice that a -- that the products be seized, that the
manufacturer be enjoined from further distribution, or that
the manufacturer be punished.

It is~ criMinal offense under

the Act to market a misbranded drug.
The Act defines misbranding to include the use of
labeling which is false or misleading in any particular, and
there is cenainly no question that a f~sie·or misleading
claim of effectiveness for a drug is a misbranding.
The government has never brought such an action
against the products that are involved in this case.
That would be the rc~edy.
Now, this was the only remP.rly available to the Food
and Drug Administration for any product on the market as of
1962, if it believed that the pro uct was not effective for Ls

129
recommended uses.
However, when Congress amended tbe Act to provicc a
degree of premarketing control over products, it did not apply
that premarketing control retrospectively to products then on
the market without qualification: instead, it added a qrand··
father clause, and it's the scope of thrt gr ndfather clause
which is the crux of the controversy between USV Pharmaceutic;l
Corporation and the government.
The question, as I said, is whic:1 definition of new
drug applies.

The grandfather cla11se says that if a product

is a new drug -- I beg your pardon.

The gcandfathcr clause

says that if a product is a new drug under the new definition,
it stilJ. may not be required to qo through the preclearance
requirement if three conditions ara met.
No;,, this Section 107(c) (4) is a tec,1nical and very
precise statute, and it's not the sort of provision which
can be read impressionistically,

Congress spelled out its

three criteria extremely carefully, and we think a broadbrush treatment of the complex lclnguage it employed would not
do justice to the statute, which is printed -QUESTION:
MR. HOFFMAN:

Where is that in the Joint Appendix?
Page 482, Mr. Chief Justice.

And also at page 3 of the petitioner's brief in 666,
Page 482 sets out Section 107(cl (4) of the Act, anc
this is the first non-indented paragraph, a little bit below

13C

the middle cf the ptcqe.
And the three er reria are:

of the 1962 am1;ndrnents.

Thl'r

fir~t, that the produ~t
prio= to th~ enactment

is no doubt that the products

involved in this case were so rn-rketed, an~ that th

products

in this case, therefore, meet the first criterion for grandfather protection.
The second requirement is ~hat the product was not a
new drug under the statute as it stood when the amendments were
adopted.

That is, that t.he product was then qer rally

recognized by qualified experts as safe for its recommended
uses.
And the district court found, and the Court o~
Appeals agreed, that 1n 1962 the products involved in thi~
case were generally recognized as safe for their recoinmendc<"
uses; that the products therefore, wc,re not nc,w drugs when the
~tatutc was amended.

So that the second criterion for qrand-

father status is also met.
The third requirement ~or grandfather qtatus is th
one that brings us here today.

That requirement ls that the

product was not covered by an effective application under
Section SOS of the A~t at the time the statute was amended.
And the controversy today io over the proper construction of
this third criterion.
Now, as I've said, USV n1>ver filed an ll!>plication

131

under Section 505 for either of its two me-too products.
This was be~ause each was consictered from the outset by USV
to be gener lly recognized by qualified expertz as safe for
its intended uses, and therefore 11as not a new d~ ug.

New

drug applications were not required for such prooucts, .i.ad the
marketing of each of these t11O me-too prociucts was initiateo
and continued on the strength of general recognition of
safety.
That was the basis on which the products were
marketed, and it was the only basis.
The Court of Appeals held in this case that productf
such as these meet literally the criteria for exemption
stated in the grandfather clause; and this is at paqe 470 of
the Appendix , meet literally the criteria for exemption.
We a,;iree.
But the court went on to hold that USV' s products
in this category do not enjoy grandfather status, notwithstanding
that they meet literally the requirements for exemption,
because USV, as the manufacturer, was itself the applicant
under the NDA's for earlier additions of the products which
were first marketed under effective NDA's.
We petitioned for certiorari to review the decision
insofar as it drew a distinction on the basis of the identity
of the manufacturer in his role in marketing other products,
the government agrees with us that no such distinction is

132

supportable.

The government agrees, in other •,iords, th t if •

product was a me-too version of an earlier produc., it m~tte
not who the original manufacturer was.

And th. aov rnrn nt

therefore agrees that our me-too products shoulc be treated
just like everybody else's.
Bu- we differ as to what that tre tint shoul~ be.
The ·overnment argues for affirm nee of the judgment a

MR. HOFFMAN:

But, regardless of this Court's decision on the
original products that were covered by effPctive applications
under Sectio•1 505, the me-too products, in our view,
independently meet the criteria for exemption, because these
products never were covered by an effective applicat~on.
They weren't covered in '62, they ueren't covered in '58,
they weren't covered in '55, they were never covered by an
effective application.
QUESTION:

Isn't that because they qot a free ride,

a piggyback?
MR. HOFFMAN:
Ql'I.:STION:
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice,
What is it, then?
they didn't qet a piggyback because

their marketing in no way dependea on the fact that there was
a new drug application effective for some other product.

The

134

marketing depended solely on the fact that this product had
beco~~ , that ~his type of product had become aonerally
recognized as safe for its intended uses.

If there had been

no prior product, but there were a general recocnition of
safet:;• under whatever standarc:" applie~, then thes

would have come on the market.

Defore 1962?

QUESTION:
MR. HOFF'f.'.AN:

Before 1962.

Or, for that matter,

today.
The n~-too product cal!le on the market because it wa
generally recognized as safe, and therefore not a new drug
under tho '38 Act.

It continues on the market today, in

USV'o view, because, while it would not meet the ar.cnded
definition, so that it would require prcclearance by FDA,
if the amended definition applied, our view is that the
grandfather clause withholds the amended definition from this
product that was on the market prior to 1962,
The correctnesc of the decision below os to these
-too prod1cts is oho n, we think, by three principal con-

135

siderations, which are gone into in our brief; and if I may
briefly sum.narize them:
Fii·st is the lite:cal language of clause (CJ of
Section l07(c) (4), construed in accordance with Conqress'
demonstrated understanding of that language an~ of tl-ie concep .. s
it incorporates.

That concept is the concept of an

effective application under 505.
Now, the government says 505 is irrelevant in
construing the grandfather clause.
!low

But it's not irrelevant.

can it be irrelevant if clause (CJ says that on~ of the

criteria for grandfather protection is whether the product
was covered by an effective application under Section 505?
So the critical question, in terms of statutory
language, we think, is:

what did Congress think it meant

when it used the words "effective e.pplication •mc'er Section
505"?
Now, we thin!< Congress was pretty clear as to what

that meant.

Our brief explains that it was explicitly

called to the attention of Congress by Secretary Ribicoff,
that an effective application under Section 505 was a one-trip
ticket only, it was good for the manufacturer who filed the
product and it was good only for the product for which that
application was filed, not for anybody else's product and not
for any other product of the same manufacturer.
Congress reflected its understanding of this concept

136

in other provisions of the statute, which are discussed in ou
brief.

And while it did not eddre·s th. sub" ct of me- oo

products directly at any time, as the governncnt points out,
thnt is only to show simply that Congress nay not lnve been
aware that the statute it did enact would protect me-too's.
But whether Congress was aware of it or not, this
is the statute they enacted, and our position is th~t when
Congress set up, as a criterion for grandfather protection,
that the product not be covered by an effect ve l''>r>lication
under Sectio~ SOS, that the case has to be dccid don the baris
of what Congress thought! was covered

":.y

an effect·ve applica-

tion under Section 505.
The second consideration that we think 'llilit tea in
favor of the Court of Appeals ruling on me-too products in
general is that the only available evidence of Congress'
purpose in amending the definition of new drug in the first
•
plac~ shows a very limited purpose. Recemhcr, the grandfather
provision cotttrols the applicability of the amendment to the
Section 20l(p) definition of new drug.
So, we believe it's relevant to inquire:

what was

Congress' purpose in amending the definition?
The government has stated in its brief that they
agree that there io only a limited evidence of purpose in the

legJslative history, and that purpose was to clear up solllC
onfusion that was prevalent in the Sen teat the time that

137

the new drug definition was amended.
The purpose of the arrcndment was to insure tl,at ne~
clai~s for old products ~ould be covered by the new
definition,

!:'O

that if aspirin were to be newly recommended for

acne, for example, to use the example that's been used here
this morning, then a neu drug applicati-:,n would have to be
filed for aspirin insofar as it was being recol!'roE:ndecl for the
new use.
That was the purpose, tr '!lt was the only p\1rpose
that is evidenced in the legislative hi,toryi and we think
that because me-too products obviously have nothing to do
with that purpose, that the st«tute shoulo not he disto ted
so as to deny these products the grandfather status which
Congress literally and explicitly conferred on them.
If the Court has no further questions, I prefer to
save the balance of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. PREY, ESQ.,

And as I listened to

literal language of -the statute, regardless of how absurd the

results, let the whole house of cards that Congress erected
fall down around our heads, the literal lang,1aqe of the stattt
requir::s it.
We submit that the language of Section 107(c) (4) ir
no way comp ls an exemption of mc-too•c.

QUESTION:

What language of the

of ~ection (4), do you rely on to brinq me-too dru a?
MR. FREY: Well, I think it's very significant, if
you'll turn to the statute, I rely not on the statute that 1r.
Hoffman read to you, in which !'le inserted tho word "product"
in place of "drug". I rely on Section 107(c) (4).
Now, in Section 107(c) (4) -QUESTION: Thot's on poge 482?

MR. FREY:

Now, the drug here 1s bioflavonoids, the product is
Bivam.

Now, there isn't anything here on this page, in this

statute, t.~at compels you to read that to say Bivarn instead o
bioflavonoids,

And if you read it in the generic sense that

QUESTION: Except in a colloqU!' with Mr. Friedman
this morning, I understood that the governmer,t's defirition of
me-too drug was not just different trade names for precise~y
the same generic product, but similar p1·oducts as well

'l.S

identical products.
MR. FREY:

Well, because -- it depends on tha

degree of similarity of the product.

You can 1ave, and in

many cases you have a product that is identic~l in everyt!Lnq
but the brand name,

And under the Court of Ap~eals reading,

that product would be the me-too.
QUES'l'ION:

That's the easy case for you under the

grandfather clause,
MR. FREY:

Now, there is an issue in some cases, as

there is in the Bentex case, for instance, as to whether you
may really be dealinq with a different druq that is not the
same drug that was covered by the new druq applicntion.
But the position of the agency, and it has been explained
in its drug efficacy study, Implementation Requlations of
October 1972, which we've cited in our brief, it's basically
that identical, similar, or related products, and this is
defined by chemical composition and therapeutic use.

It's

a scientific concept which has parameters which I can't really
get into today, and there can be factual issues as to whether
a particular product is in the same generic family with the
drug that's covered by the NOA.

1,;o

t,;ow, if Section 107(c) (4) is construed in th~ way
USV urges, in an individual product sense, the results are
irrational, they're discrirninctory aJl'IOnq r.:anufacturcrs,
they're corepletely destLuctjve of the congressional purpose
in requiring that drugs be shown to be effective for their
claimed uses.
Now, let me give you a scen&rio of what would happen.
Sometime between 1938 and 1962 a manufacturer decides that a
certain compound is useful for the treatment of n certain
disease or conditior..

He does studies reqardinq the safetv

of that compound, an:1 he files an application witt'. FOA, which
revi ws his application and allows it to 'JO into effect.
He then starts manufacturing that prod•1ct.
Now, h•o or three or five other manufacturers m y
decide that they also want to market the same product,

nd

if it ' s not patented they're free to do so, except they have
to file their own applications until such time as the drug
comes to be generally recognized as safe, which it comes to
be because there have been NDA ' d products out on the market
that are generically the same.

Jlnd at that point MY

manufacturer can market his product without going through the
regulatory procedure, and that includes the NDA ~older, who
con put it out under different brand na=o or anything else.
Now, the ratio of these me-too products to the
products that are named in tl:e eppl ication is qui tc high.

PnA

141

has found that as high as 13 to l.

In the Dentey. case we

have 23 manufacturers of me-too pr()(lucts, and orly tuo
manufacturers who held NDA's.
N,'.lw, under the '62 .uncndments, Congress said, rev.i.e
these NDA's, determjne the efficacy of thPse drua$.

1

1,nd the

agency does it. And the agency finds under the stanearc•s t!iat
Congress has established that tt,e druqs are inefi'ective, or
that they lack substantial evidence of effectiveness, which
is somewhat different.

And it withdraPs approval of the N~

and it takes the pioneer d1·ugs off t 1e ,1ar·,et.

And here are

twenty other manufacturE"rs still on tre market with the
identical product sitting or the drug store sh?lves.
Nothing has been accomplished for the consumer;
nothing has been accomplished but a complc':ely irrational
discrimination between identically situated people that does
not correspond to any regulatory purpose that Congress had.
Now, nothing in the legislative history indicates
that this was Congress ' intent .

~r. Hoffman relies on

something in Part 2 of the Senate Report, when he says that
they were concerned with new claims .

He omits in his brief,

and he omitted to mention in his argument, the closing sentence
of that paragraph, which says:

the effect of this amendment

on drugs already on the market is discussed below under
transitional provisions .
So that the paragraph on which he relies has nothing

142

to do with the effect cf the amendment of Section 201 on aruqr,
already on the market in 1962 .
Now, he says, well, let's rely -- and the inrustry
says, let's rely on the power of FOJ\. as a prosecutor with the
aid of the Departroent of Justice, to go chasinq th se people
in the courts with these very uc~ious remedies.

Mn.

FREYc

Yes, and it's --

QUESTION:

Whnt's the burden of i:,roof ~r, --

MR. FREY:

In an ac1roinistrative proceeding, the

burden is clearly on the manufacturer.

He must demonstrate

that there exists substantial evidence of ef!ectivcness.
And I think that's the only way it could be.

There is no

practical way for the Commissioner to demonstrate the nonexistence of such evidence .

I don't know

row

he would qo

about it.
QUESTION:

The burden in a civil injunctive action,

I take it, would be the normal -preponderance of t:1e evidence
test that you have in civil proceedings?
MR. FREY:

I think that's correct.

And that's a significant difference , in terms of
discrimination between the pioneer and the me-too.

The

pioneer is being made to show to the aq~ncy ' s satisfaction
that there exists substantial evidence of effectiveness,
and1he me- too, if the FDA could ever chase after and collar

144

all of them all over the country, in these tliousands o
individual suits, the burden would be on FDA to

3tahli h

their ineffectiveness in a misbranc'linq ac-t.;.on.
Now, the structure of the '62 ameno

clearly supports our position.

Nobody has told you, and nobody will tell you, that the
definition in 20l(p) is in an individual product sense.

It's

generic, and plain common sense tells uo to J.nterpret sectior,
107(c) (4) generically also.
I see my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All riqht, Mr. Frey.

You have a few minutes left, r think, ir. Hof man.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP JOEL E. HOFF IAN, ESQ.,
ON BEH1\LF OP t"SV PHARMACEUTICAL CORPOPATION

MR. HOFFMAN:
Chief Justice.

I'll try not to use them all, Mr.

We are grateful for the cxparsion of the time.

MR. CHIFP JUSTICE BURGEn:

I think it's about seven

minutes.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Frey has said, quite correctly,

that Section l07(c) (4), on paqe 482, refers to a drug rather
thnn to a product.
But that doesn't ndvance the ball any, in our
opinion.

He says that 201(p) is generic, and therefore 107(c)

(4) must be qeneric.

ut, aqai~, we r.tre s that, as the

145

government did in its brief, it just iqnores the fact that
in carving out an exemption from the applicability of the
amended definition, which is generic, Congre s nrndc that
exemption turn on a highly p~rsonal and particularized factor;
namely, was the drug -- and I ' 11 use Mr. Frey's ,md the
statute's word -- was the drug covered by an effective
application?
Now, if Mr. Frey is riqht, and a d=uq is covered hy
an effective application, if any member of its generic class
is covered, then once the first NDA is approved, nobody else
need file a new drug application.

Because Section 505(.,),

the basic statutory requirement, and this is on page 117,
505(a) says "No person shall introduce or deliver ••. any
new drug, unless an app.·oval of an application filed pursuant
to subsection (b) is effective with respect to such drug."
Now, if the word "drug" is generic, then it's
generic.

If it's personal, it's personal.
We pointed out in our reply brief that what makes

the 20l(p) definition generic is the rather awkward phrasing
that a new drug is any drug the composition of which is such
that a -- that it is not generally recognized by experts .
Now, that's not found anywhere in the statute.
Except 20l(p) .

The grandfather clause doesn't say that a

product is disqualified from grandfathered status if it's a
product which, the composition of which i,:: such that it's

14

covered by a new drug application.

And so wr!, therefore,

rest on the proposition that Congress enacted a statute,
Mr. Frey ii:: not testifyinq before a leqislative con-..-nittee,
he ' s here before this Court askinq it to interpret what
Congress wrote.

MR. HOFFMP.N:

I do have an ans~.er, ~Ir. ,Tu.,tice

Blackmun, if I may state it just briefly.
The Congress continued in force, we believe, as to
products that were on the market in 1962, whatever regulatory
scheme was then in force as to that product.

If the

product was being regulated as a new drug, actively regulated,
then it would continue to be so regulated under t e amended
scheme.

If it wasn't being regulated under the ad~inistrativ~

new drug scheme, which is the position of the me-too's, then
it continued not to be.
Now, this may be seen as unfair, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have suggested that in fact
NDA'd products which had become no longer new are not subject
to the amended definition of new drug, either.

That issue is

We are in the position

of, as the district court found, having withdrawn the
application from FDA.

But that is an entirely separate issue,
