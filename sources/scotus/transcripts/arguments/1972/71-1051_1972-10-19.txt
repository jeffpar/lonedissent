MR. CFISP JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-1051* Paris Theatre against Slaton.
Mr. Smith
ORAL ARGUMEN T OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF Of THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case originated in the City of Atlanta when
the Respondents filed a complaint seeking a, in essence, a
declaratory judgment and injunction to prohibit the showing
of two movies.

This comes about because the theatre, the

Paris Adult Theatre, had two separate sections to It where
separate films were being shown and one would walk into the
cashier and go Into one or go into the other.
Q

So there was a common lobby?

MR. SMITH*.

A common lobby, yes, sir-.

And then

the door would open into the particular film they wanted to

go see.
The complaint filed by the prosecutor — or the
prosecution' or the Respondents in this case, sought a
temporary Injunction to stop the-; showing of the film
pencil:.-,; the he .cuing on the permanent injunction.

Fortuitously

the- judge di ", not sign that broad of a temporary restraining
order, merely he sought to stop the Petitioners In this case

or altering or

removing them.
A hearing was scheduled in January and, ultimately*
on January the 13th, 1971, the films were produced.
evidence produced before the court

Their

indicated that this

theatre had its outside was painted so that no one could see
inside and there were several legends on the windows to the
extent, "For Adults Only,*5
prove it,*’

"You must be 21 and be able to

”If viewing the nude body offends you, do not

enter,"
The* forewarning of the character of the material
which one might expect to find therein was clearly stated on
the outside.

The prosecution at the time of the presentation

of its case brought in several witnesses who had viewed the
movie.

These were investigators in the office of the

Solicitor and they indicated that these films showed
explicit sexual acts of cunnilingual, fellatio and inter­
course .
The trial Judge, after viewing the movies, found
they did not show these explicit acts.

They were simulated.

The Supreme Court of Georgia said, well, it doesn’t leave
really much to the imagination and it is close enough and
besides, we thought that the acts which, in essence, were
simulated in "I am Curious Yellow,,f that this is the same
kind of thing,

We thought it was obscene in "I am Curious

Yellow” and the Supreme Court of the United States has not
,
and
reversed in that oase^so as far as we are concerned,, this
is hard-core pornography.
That was just the title they threw on itv even, though
there were no explicit sexual acts consumated in this
particular film, sort of in the sense of the language of
this Court In Rs.be versus Washington when it was talking
about certain types of films.

The Court, as I said, issued its order and held
that these were not hard-core pornography, that there were
no minors Involved and that as far as the court was concerned,
they were tasteless,

vulgar, childish, unimaginative,

boring, but as far as it was concerned, it was protected by
the? Const!tutIon.
The State Supreme Court reversed and we are here on
this issue.
We pointed out initially in our brief that the
procedure — there were no procedural guidelines for this
taking process in the state.

There is no statute that

permits thisj there is no authoritative Judicial construction
that will say that as far as the court will hear it on a
certain day, the court will decide within a certain number
of days as to its decision in this particular matter.
We say the procedural safeguards are lacking.
are not there, but yet the state has been allowed to

They

6
do it in this matter.
More importantly, we would like to direct our
argument to the question suggested by this Court with regard
the display of sexually-oriented films.
My brother, in his brief, would interpret the
terminology ”Any sexually-oriented films" as meaning obscene
films.

I interpret

that in a slightly different way.

We

view this as being whatever the definition — whatever
definition of the members of this Court, whatever definition
is applied by statute, whether it is

something to the left

of Pinnochio on up to the extremes that Mr. Moran has cited
in his brief.
Whatever — however you define it, whatever
denominator you use to define it and aside from the specific
definition, is there a constitutional right to offer this for
dissemination in a. commercial theatre where there are no
children admitted and where there

are some notice, some

warning on the outside of the theatre as to the character
of the material being offered therein.
Wow, my brother would say, "Yes, but there was no
sign that said cunnilingual activity depicted, no sign that
said fellatio.

It just says, ’If the nude body offends you,

please don’t enter.’”
But the first time we put a sign out that said
cunnilingual activity and fellatio in, then they would be

7
hauling us

in

and charging us with pandering, which is

in essence what they did in other cases in that jurisdiction

where that particular matter was present on the outside of
the theatre.

So in this context., this is what we .have, and

addressing ourselves to the greater point, we don’t think
necessarily is inconsistent with the argument we
are making today.
This Court, in essence, did say in Roth that, yes,
obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment.but it went
on to say that the door barring federal and state encroach­
ment into this area must be kept tightly closed to prevent
encroachment upon more important interests.
We suggest that the Re dr up cases which,, in essence,
started a trend in which there 'ware approximately 33 or 34
cases reversed per curiam, led us gently from the point of
focusing on the expression to focusing on conduct.

It is, as

Mr. Fleishman pointed out with regard to the California
Attorney General who was

walking down the street last night.

We do not have in this record any reference to any­
one standing outside of the theatre and hustling them in as
you might find in a nightclub or something like that,
nothing whatsoever,

There is absolutely no hustling or in

■2'./ way pandering, however

you might define those terras

involved in this case.
We sugry, yt that the right of the disseminator to

8
assort tills position, although he is riot necessarily the
viewer, is clearg

from a variety of cases held by this Court,

One of the key points that the Court has made with regard to
the First Amendment is that if there are not the procedural
safeguards, we are going to have inducement of selfcensorship and when one induces self-censorship, then in
essence, the public is the loser.

The public is the loser and

in prosecutions undertaken without, in this
context, sure they can be punished if there is going to be
an Intrusion but we do not have that in this case.
not in this case the problem that

There is

might be presented in a

magazine or a bookstore v/here the book is taken out of the
is
store and left in a trashcan and the possibility/that it may
foe found by children.
We have a film in a commercial theatre where people
can go and view it .

In Karalexts yarsus Byrnes., reversed

by this Court on other grounds, the lower court held that if
Stanley, in essence, can watch a film of any kind, any
sexually-oriented film, sexually-explicit film in the privacy
of his home, why can’t a few fellows get together and watch
it in a commercial setting and have Just the same sense of
privacy and the same sense of protection?

We suggest that makes good sense.
We pointed out in our brief that approximately
100‘-millions of dollars are spent in a year on the sale of

9
or exhibition of sexually-explleit material and that is an
awful lot of public support for an interest In sexuallyexplicit mat e rIa1»
Q

I wonder how many dollars are spent In efforts

to suppress it by local and state police and federal?
MR. SMITH:

I would say, your Honor, a great deal, 1

am sure, is spent.
Q

A lot of people mould be put out of work —

(Laughter.)
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think Mr. Clancy, my brother

who has the Amicus brief in this case, probably would feel
that he was being put out of work, but in this context, we
think that the focus on action, on the conduct of the
disseminator, would not be inconsistent with the

protection

of the right of the public under the First Amendment.

We are

not, as in Reldel, conceding that these films are obscene.
In Reldel, for the purpose of the motion to dismiss,
there was a confession that for that matter — assume the
films were obscene, we are saying something different.

We

are saying that the definition of whether the films are
obscene is not relevant

until an Inpermissable intrusion

occurs by the act of the disseminator in thrusting it upon
someone or by having it involved with minors in the particular
case.

This does not exist

here.

So we say it is not

inconsistent for this to have occurred.

10

Me also have

argued and set forth that the film

Itself 3 regardless of the argument we make on the right of
an adults the right- of a disseminator to show films in an
adult theatrea that these films are not obscene.

They are

not unlike films, for Instance * involved in the Hartstein
case9 films that were Involved in the Wiener case,, and this
points out the difficulty, we suggest, in why this Court
should enunciate a broader protection and a positive
protection to eliminate the difficulty inherent in trying to
fit a definition because In some states the prurient interest
is defined as shameful and morbid.

In others, it is an

itching sensation, 1 think, using some of the terminology
taken from a marginal note by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Roth
case, using that phraseology and then prurient means so many
different things to so many different people.
And then the question of community standards.

people who just don’t care one way or the other or at least
don’t show a great deal of positive interest in responding.
We have indicated that there were community
attitude surveys by the Presidential Commission on Pornography
and Obscenity where several millions of dollars were spent,
taking a survey on the demographic basis throughout the
Unite-:! .’States and one of the conclusions were that many
people felt, as Mr. Justice-White-pointed out-in- Reidel.
that there is a developing sentiment where people, adults,
should be allowed to read and see what they want to see and,
in essence, that is what the public said.
Now, again, taking the definition of what is the
community standard?

And when we talk about candor, what is

going oil to the concept of social value.

Some

Jurisdictions have eliminated or are trying to eliminate by

12
referendum the concept of social value in an obscenity
litigation.

Is the fact that a material which Is pruriently
contemporary
appealing, 1b the fact that material exceeds/community
standards — but,

if it has soma slight modicum of social

value as was the Kcmolrs decision •— is this enough to
protect it?

And communities are trying to do away with that

and there is the problem of the local versus the national
and how local is it and how national is national?
This presents & problem.

The courts are literally

flooded with obscenity cases and I know that this Court has
a great many of them that have found their way up here.
There are lots of cases on appeals' in federal
courts and state courts which are awaiting decision of this
court in this case on these issues.

There are many cases

being made almost dally in the lower courts and which will
ultimately find their way up to the appellate courts and,
depending on who the judges are that you are sitting in
front of and how he views the words of this Court in context
or out of context, the Jury Instructions and such given,
make it very difficult — make it very difficult for
,o be the uniformity that there should be in the application
of a national Constitution, and

there is where we get back to

the point where the focus we suggest should be on conduct.
If we want to go out and talk about a political
aae.did.ate it is one thing, .but if we are going to do it at

13
2:00 o’clock in the morning in a residential neighborhood,
then the right of freedom of speech is ended right there.

It

is not the right, of course, to do it any time, any place
that you want,

You can't block ingress and egress if you are

going to do picketing.
In the same sense here, no one forces these people
to go into the store.

It is the right of the individual to

choose and it is the right of the disseminator here to
assert the right of the citlsen who might want to see this.
We are doing this and, in essence, if the Court were to go
to this point, then the self-censorship factor would be
eliminated and I think that, as Mr. Justice Brennan has
pointed out in the past In some of his decisions, the public
would really then be in a position to choose, view and dis­
regard what it is and then it is the mature and free society
that should be allowed to males that choice.

It should not be

jurors focused in the light, the public light, where they feel
they must react because there is a community pressure.

If

they say it is not obscene, somebody will think they are
dirty old men.

This is’the concept.

We eliminate these things by focusing on the conduct
so that if there is a public display, then this is eliminated.
The State of Oregon, fox1 instance, now has litigated — has
passed, a statute and there can be no prosecution for
obscenity unless there is public display of material by the

14
public highways;

in an adult-only bookstore, in an adult-only

theatre, it is okay, as long as there are not juveniles
involved.
The State of Hawaii has now passed the same kind of
law as the State of Oregon, again holding

this is the kind

of law that should exist.
Q

Are those matters discussed in your brief,

Mr. Smith?
MR. SMITH;
Q

They are not?

MR. SMITH;
Q

Yes, I can furnish them to the Court.

Would you submit them?

MR, SMITH:
Q

No, six*, they are not.

Do you have them?

MR, SMITH;
Q

No, sir, they are not.

Yes, sir.

Are those the only two that you know of,

Hawaii and. Oregon?
MR. SMITH:

They are the only two states which

have thus far done this.
Q

How recent is Oregon?

MR, SMITH:
your Honor.

Oregon is about a year and four months,

Hawaii is about four or five months.

It is

very recent.
And we suggest that this works and I have quoted
extensively

from Professor Emerson’s book and he is

suggesting the solution to this Court to get it out of a lot
of the problems with regard to obscenity litigation.
We think it is a sound solution.

The Chief

Justice is well-known for his views regarding the clogging
of the dockets.

Ha say there is a. big way to get a lot of

these cases out of the way by enunciating a principle like
this which will protect the 3hock that may be found to the
public that wants to avoid confrontation but at the same time
giving the right to the individual who wants to view and read.
And I would like to say —
Q

Thera was no jury in this case* was there?

MR. SMITH;
Q

No, sir.

Indeed, it was a proceeding in the nature of

an equitable proceeding?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir, that is correct,

In the Petitioner for Certiorari, you say in

your brief that the relevant statutes and constitutional
provisions are in the Certiorari petition and I pick that up
and all I find is a criminal statute,
MR. SMITH:
Honor,

That is the point 1 am making, your

I said earlier,your Honor, there is no statute to

cover what they were doing because of the criminal statute
they sought to undertake and utilize a ad hoc procedure.
Q
int e rp re t at i on,

Well, that is an ordinary civil, equitable

16
MR. SMITH:

That is correct,, but I am relying upon

the criminal statue for definitional purposes and, of
course, ultimately they may have decided to take the films
when they obtained them and* as an ancillary proceeding*
institute a criminal proceeding.

That is the statute under

which they travel* the definition under which they travel
and* of course* one of our complaints here is that the matter
was simply an ad hoc proceeding.
Q

It was

Well* of course* if the courts of Georgia say

that that is a procedure available under Georgia law * 1
suppose that is the end

of it as far as we are concerneds

although apparently there is no statutory authority for it.
MR. SMITH:

No* sir* there is no statutory

authority.
Q

Well* you must proceed by the Georgia courts,

MR. SMITH:

Yes* but again, they approved the

procedure in this particular case, but they did not say
or dwell or say that, you know, the judge issued his opinion
within so many days and
Q

That is your Freedman argument, isn’t it?

MR.

Yes, sir.

That Is the point I was

making.
Q

Well, Mr. Smith, you complained that in fact

here the judge took an unduly long time on the facts —
MR. SMITH:

No, six3, no, sir

Q

— he didn’t, but because there were no

guidelines3 another judge might have.
MR, SMITH:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

Yes, sir,

Was this in the nature of the ancient nuisance

type of injunction?
MR. SMITH:

Sir, I do not

see that.

Mr. Clancy,

in his brief and the Amicus brief seems to suggest that and,
you know, 1 did not find that was even an issue in this case.
There was no — this was not called Hobnoxious public
nuisance”

It was not being shown in an outdoor theatre.

As

I said, it was an indoor theatre and this was simply an effort
to suppress the showing and distribution or exhibition of
these two films to adults.

Q
to have one.

You mentioned an Amicus brief.

1 don’t know who filed an Amicus brief,

MR. SMITH:
Q

1 don’t seem

Well, I got one this morning.

It was just filed this morning, late.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, I just received it this

morning.
Q

Of course, you won — you prevailed in the

trial court?
MR. SMITH:

Q

Yes, sir.

And you had an adverse determination which

was not on the issue of obscenity, as I understand it as such

18
MR. SMITH:
Q

And that was favorable to your clients?

MR, SMITH:
Q

Yea, sir,

The first ruling was, yes3 sir.

And you still think that that procedure did

not satisfy the .freedom standards?
MR, SMITH:

Viewing it, as I was responding to
Judge?
Justice Rehnquiat, the fact that/Ethridge did it this
way* we are left then to assert our procedural due process
in the vast number of cases to the

efficiency of a particular

Judge and a particular Jurisdiction and that is not what I
understood this' Court meant in Freedman and Teltel Film
Corporation and other cases that followed that.
I would like to save whatever few minutes I have
l©-‘tj if I may, for the conclusion of Mr# Moran’s case,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MORAN, ESQ,,
ON

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justices arid may it please

the Court;
I filed this suit in the opinions of the law with
its variant sections.

There existed at that time, in Georgia,

three basic types of procedure.

One was strictly civil.

One was strictly criminal and one was civil leading toward the
criminal process.

19
Now, before 1 was in office in this particular
case, the Solicitor- travelled the criminal route.

He was

The federal court says there they were mining apples and
oranges, civil and criminal procedure and it complicated
matters and as long as the court would stick-••with the civil
process on the one hand and the absolute criminal process on
the other, we had a clear and defined area that the criminal
process would inherently grant to the person a far greater
protection than any civil injunction could grant.
Nevertheless, the outline or the method of using
an injunction was suggested in Gable.

Then we started

that process and a petition was filed alleging that the film
in this case was obscene, setting out a

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:00 p,
Ur’

Moran, you may

continue.
MR. MORAN:

I believe at the recess we were at the

point concerning the procedure employed in this particular
case for the State of Georgia.
The petition as it was served upon the Defendants
at that time did not restrain the showing of the film, did
not in any way interfere with the showing of the film.

It

simply restrained and enjoined them temporarily from
removing the film without the jurisdiction of the court and
the hearing was set immediately thereafter.
From that juncture it Is entirely up t© the
'exhibitor whether he wants the hearing or whether state will
press for it at that time, which we generally

do.

Any

continuance Is on the behalf of the exhibitor.
In the meantime 3 he can continue to show the film.
Then, after an adversary hearing — and I might add and I
cautioned Counsel I would mention this to the Court — that
the film was produced by Counsel wrapped in' a Christmas
package and which the court graciously accepted in the manner
in which it was tendered.
The film was shown and the court in this case

to the court and then -thereafter was it

returned to the Defendant?
MR. MORAN:

No, sir, it was kept as evidence in

that particular case.
Q

But they were permitted to go ahead with the

showing on another copy?
MR, MORAN:

Yes, sir.

They could do so.

Did they have more than one print ©f the film?
MR. MORAN:

1 do not know, sir.

But that is

the

procedure Imposed on us by the Federal Judiciary in Georgia.
I might point this out at this juncture —
Q

What this amounted to was a seizure of

evidence by way of a civil action.
MR. MORAN:
Q

Yes, sir, after a hearing.

But did X understand, was this the only print

of the film?
MR. MORAN:
Q

I do not know that point.

You did say, I thought, that they were free

to continue to exhibit.

22
MR, MORAN:

They could have exhibited.

There was

no prohibition about exhibiting the film.
Q

But you don't know that they, in fact, did

exhibit?
MR. MORAN:

No, sir,

Mo, sir.

We do not use this

procedure any more and we only used it then because it was
imposed upon us.

We resisted it then and we resist it now.

For you see, unlike most states, since 1877» Georgia
enacted a constitutional provision which reads, MLiberty of
speech or of the press guaranteed.

No law shall ever be

passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech of of the
press.

Any person may speak,write and publish his sentiments

on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that
liberty.H
Now, on that statute or because of that.statute, x
personally filed suit in K, Gordon Murray Productions
versus Floyd in challenge to censorship ordinances in the
City of Atlanta, Georgia

in 1962,

Tho ordinances, I

contended then,were Infected with the vice from Teitel and
the Georgia Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional, as
abridging this particular provision and said that they could
•' .how what they please but they are going to be responsible
for what they show.

If it amounts to criminal acts in nature,

they can be punished for the criminal acts in nature.
Just as you can have a gun legitimately on your

a3
person and that Is all right, or in your horne, but if you use
that gun for an Illegal purpose, that is something else again
and that Is the procedure we adopted. In the State of Georgia.

And I might add. In just passing, that reference
was made to Oregon and Hawaii * I believe, reducing the
standards of obscenity or abolishing it althgether.
That, I say5 is well and good, if that is what the
state there wants.

This is a legislative problem we are

coping with and not, as we contend, a judicial problem.
Q

How would you go about this procedure — what

procedure would you employ if you were doing that now in Georgia
MR. MORAN:

In — we would proceed under a search

warrant and proceed criminally.

We would make the arrest, have»

the commitment hearing which we are required to do in a matter
of 24 to 48 hours and have every criminal protection of any
person accused of crime.

There could be no destruction.

The

only difference in civil process is strictly civil and
strictly criminal without the abortive intertwined in that in

a civil process it is for the purpose of seizure and
destruction.
In the criminal process it is seizure for the
purpose of evidence.
Well, then, what you do, I suppose, is that someofficer would have to see' the exhibition, and then he would

make an affidavit in support of the search warrant and go to a

24
magistrate arid get the
information.

Is that right?

the justice take it from there.

remark was made here today that it does net clearly depict
certain acts, that you have to use your imagination, and some
of these experts testify that way but in the New Orleans
Book Mart case I think it was Judge Brown observed this in
his opinion, "Thus one defense witness testified that a
particular photograph did not depict cunnilingus but only
suggested it."
This is a photograph, of a nude female with photo­
graphic focus on her genital area showing a male head and

25
face a few inches away, mouth open and tongue out and the
witness said9 "That just suggests something.

It doesn’t

show anything."
We get down to the next issue,

'They make a

professional witness or expert witness and this is where we
get into an unusual area because the so-called "expert
witnesses” fall into two categories,

One, nothing is

obscene and, two, everything is obscene which leaves the
jurors sitting mutual again.
So as in this ease, and the witness is a very
personable fellow, they brought in a hired gun

and that is

He comes there for a purpose.

He could give no concern about what happens and this hired
gun is usually a nonresident.

He just comes riding in.

Then

his services are contracted for before he views the material.
That is true in this ease.

The man got on the airplane, flew

to. Atlanta, got an agreement how much he was going to be
paid, was going to testify and he had not seen anything he
was going to testify about.
As a matter of fact, ha hasn’t seen both these films

Then he testifies and he collects his bounty and
rides off into the setting aim to parrot his testimony to
anyone who wants to buy it and he candidly confesses that no

He is for sale.

He is for hire and that Is all.

In the United States versus, Brown, the Court made
a reference to one of these hired guns and they said,
'Referring to the photographs in the two books, Dr, Hammond
stated they would appeal to some homosexuals

but not

necessarily any more than a Sears and Roebuck catalog."
Likewise, Dr,Hammond indicated that those books
were no more revolting than a television commercial showing a
man brushing his teeth.

The realm of psychiatry is indeed

highly technical and beyond the understanding of laymen, but
these conclusions seem absurd.
It goes without saying that -the difference between
the Sears ana Roebuck catalog or a

toothpaste advertisement

and these two books :1s almost immeasurable.

For example,

Sos following the reasoning and going to the
graphically obscene material* I think the Court said, which
men could not differ in their opinion?

exactly what he has to do.
I have tried one case which comes to mind where
you cross-examine these expert witnesses and the witness
actually took the stand involving 16 magazines and never
hesitated in his testimony for one minute while he was
flipping through them, so he could testify that they were
not obscene.

This is incredible but this exists.

So we

say that the procedural proposition is correct.
The fourth question is the question the Court
asked us to brief and to argue, whether a display of any
soxually-oriented filmsin a commercial theatre when surrounded
by notice to the public of their nature and by. reason of
the protection against the exposure of the films to juveniles,
is constitutionally protected?

Mr. Moran?

MR. MORAN:

Yes, sir.

Now, let me ask you one question relating or

attempting to relate to question asked to be argued by the

29
state for the record here.

Am I right in thinking that the

record made i n the trial court is silent as to whether or
not there was pandering or juvenile attendance and that sortof thing so t hat in effect whichever party had the burden
of proof on t hat point would lose?
MR. MORAM:

It was silent in that regard.

There was

no evidence of either pandering or exposure to juveniles.
Q

Was there any evidence that there not

pandering or exposure to .juveniles?
MR. MORAN:

No, sir, I don’t think it was raised

either side.
Q

You feel it was silent, then?

MR. MORAN:

Well, it was silent with these

photographs of the outs5.de of the theatre, yes, which they
said were modestly warning of what was going on
inside, but we did not consider that to be such as to be
pandering in the strict sense of the word.
Q

Well, nos but didn’t I understand your

colleague to say that there was some notice outside that no
children under a certain age would be admitted?
MR. MORAN:

I think it said "Re 21" or be gone."

did the Supreme Court see where the word "frolic".', came from.
After the viewing the film, they held it to be hard core
pornography.

I don’t think there is any question about it

and we ask this Court to go along with that.
Well, now, the fourth question, Mr. Justice»

This

Is where we get Into a very serious thing in my judgment.
;,a. suggested, for example, In Mr. Fleichman’s argument
shat the right to sell a book is based upon the

right of a

31
person to read that book.
How, Stanley limited itself and stated very clearly
that nothing —~ Roth is not impaired by what we hold here
today.

There is no question about that.

It emphasized that

Roth was not impaired a second time and said It was not
reversed.
And so did Re.1 del.

But in a number of the lower

trial courts, they said that is what the Supreme Court said,
but that is net what they meant and down the primrose path
they went and they extended Stanley to the right to possess
and to the right to receive.

And statute standing between

that highway was struck down.
The right to receive was the right to transport.
So that statute went aside.

Then to import, and that statute

can be

bo,

Then take this distinction, if it

that you have a right to show sexually-oriented

films unemeumbered and to control circumstances and hold that
this is constitutionally protected, then someone has a right
to sell these films to a distributor which envisions the right
to transport these films, which

envisions the right to

32

manufacture the films.
And when the Court holds that a person has a
constitutionally-protected right extending from a person
who wants to view a film to manufacture films in the United
States consisting of human beings and animals, human beings
and human beings, man and man

and man and woman or a

combination of the two, than vie have got a strange First
Amendment,, a very strange First Amendment.
So you can’t start extending unless you go all the
way and this is a step that is going to be taken.and they
don’t miss anything.

Now this question was decided,

1

.bought ~~ frankly I thought that Reidel was the light at the
end of the sewer.
But Roth first held that it is obscenity and its
distribution was outside the reach of the First Amendment.
In Reidel, on page 357,

this Court observed that it has

erred that there is a development sentiment that adults
should have complete freedom to produce, to deal in, to
possess and consume whatever communicative materials may
appeal to them and that the law’s involvement with obscenity
should be limited to those situations where children are
involved or where it is necessary to prevent imposition on
unwilling recipients of whatever age.
The concepts involved are said to be so elusive
that the law is so inherently unenforceable without

33
extra aga

-.ixpenditures of time and effort by enforcement

officers and that the court, the basement reassessment Is not
only vd.s® s but essential and this is what this Court said.
This may prove to be the desirable and eventual
legislative course, but if it is, the task of restructuring
the obscenity laws lies with those who pass, repeal, and
amend statutes and ordinances.

Both and like cases pose no

obstacle to such developments and that is where this question
should lie.
For it is then that some way, some control could
move to atop this line of communication along the line.

It

is easy to look at one part of the question and say, "We can
do this," and this is fine, but you must look to the overall
picture as to how it is going to affect everything and by
proclaiming a constitutional privilege on one hand may grant
a constitutional license on another in a field we did not
evan consider.
So we are getting now to ask what was urged in
this Reidel, to produce, manufacture and to create and this
would be indeed a tragic thing.
The same holding was held in Mugler verans Kansas
back in 188? and it has been that way ever since.
Now, they say, "But most of the people want to see
this stuff.

It is a multi-million dollar industry."

we are not concerned with.

The fact that they are concerned

about this lowly police officer and poor district attorney
who has to prosecute these cases doesn’t appeal to me very
favorably.

There is no valid reason for doing this.
But they say that the Congressional Commieaion

that people will see all of this stuff.

respiratory problems so X guess nobody was concerned with

Yet on the same page where this is contained, the
report did candidly say this,

American adults favor stricter laws on pornography —" that
is the Gallup Poll " -—and that 76 percent want

smut is talcing the beauty out of sex,"

36
Now, how you can join those two, or reconcile
those two, I.411 never know.

The opinion, though — and this

is my idea or understanding of this entire case

effort to have this Court make the judgment of this Commission
of Obscenity and Pornography: the judgment of this Court
which would, in effect, repeal every law on obscenity in
the United States.

If we say this can be shown in the

commercial theatre, any material under controlled•
circumstances, then every law relating to pornography through­
out the States would bo abolished except as it applies to
children.
Perhaps, may it please the Court, we have dealt
too long in trying to define the word "obscene" or
"pornography."

It is time we began to describe the act

rather than to define the word.
Wild defined it and said, certain things were hard
core pornography.

Abronovita described it and said, this is

hard core pornography.

But the judge in there also said,

;

"Emphasised in such a way as to totally depersonalise the
human model into an object or thing, plainly designed to
rake possible and this nonpunltive kind of .ultimately
effective material will affect it."
We ask the Court to affirm.

37
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Just a few brief points if it please

your Honors.
Q

Before you start, Mr. Smith, are these exhibits

pages 84, 85 and 86, which I gather are photographs of the
front of this theatre with the notices?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Were they before the trial judge?

MR. SMITH:
Q

graphs?

Yes, sir.

They were in evidence?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

Absolutely, yes, sir.

And where are the originals of those photo­

Are they here in the record?
MR. SMITH:
Q

It is hard to read, for example, from this.

MR. SMITH:
Q

I think they are.

The notice says, “Over 21,” I guess.

MR. SMITH:
Q

They should be.

Yes.

You think they are?

MR. SMITH:

They are and, in fact, the oral

testi- ony of one of the police officers indicated that there
w&.-i a sign — on page

57,

I believe, of the Appendix where

Officer Little said, “Of course, it went on to state that
no one under 21 years of age was admitted."

38
We can make them available, your Honor,•they should

be in there and I think that the ones in the Appendix were
copied from the originals which &ould be in the record.
The point we made regarding the expert witness
testimony was not so much whether —
Q

There is a picture of the building, I think,

in the Amicus brief on "F" right at the end of the Amicus
brief.

X think that is the theatre, "'Atlanta’s Finest

Mature Entertainment,” on the marquee.
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes sir, that’s right.

Is that the same exhibit?

MR. SMITH:
Q

Is that it?

Yes, sir, that is the same.

That is the reproduction of the actual

exhibit?
MR. SMITH:

I don't know where they got these

from, your Honor, but I would suppose — it appears to be
the same.
The point that we were making with regard to
expert witness testimony was that the prosecution should
produce something for the jury.

These experts theoretically

they don’t come in and say, "Well, I think this is obscene
and I. don't think this is obscene," they are talking -— they
talk about some aspects of the test , do these have educational
••/aluas?

Do these have — do these exceed the limits of

candor tolerated in the community In the representation of

sex and nudity'?

How else can you get this before a jury?

We

merely alluded to the fact and have argued that the
prosecution should have the affirmative evidenceThey not only
do not affirmatively show this, they say that ours is no
good because that if they found someone, he would, be saying
that It•was obscene and ours would say it would not be
obscene and so, really9 it is a jury question and the jury
doesn’t need any experts to help them one way or the other and
we say, of course, that is incorrect and we say that they
should have the affirmative responsibility.
The question of — made by Mr. Moran regarding the
Abelsen survey -is not' entirely complete and accurate.

The

AheXson survey in the Commission’s report on pornography and
obscenity as found on page 43 of the Government Printing
Office version clearly sets out

a

national survey of

American public opinion sponsored by the Commission
shows that the majority of American adults believe that
adults should be allowed to read or see any sexual materials
they wish.
Now, the part that Mr. Moran, talked about was only
one aspect of another survey conducted.

AbeIson conducted

numerous surveys and the one aspect that he conducted did, in
fact, talk about what Mr, Moran said, but then the major
part of the survey related to telling people there are
bookstores., there are theatres in this nation which show

40
people engaged in sexual acts and nuditys pictures of nudity
and sexual acts and then they went on to ask the people
whether or- not they thought others should be allowed to see
this, so long as it did not intrude on to their privacy and
the majority of the American people at that time., in 1969,
said yes and an even larger majority •— about another 20
points or* so •— said yes in the early part of 19?2.
Q

Well, what has this really got to do with the

issue before us?
MR. SMITH:
before us is that if

I — what it has to do with the issue
we listen to these factors, we see

that there is a lot of confusion in trying to apply what
this Court set out, thinking perhaps it was a good, solid
solution, a line limiting and saying what is obscene and
what is not obscene*
This has been construed in very many ways and a
lot of other problems have come back and what it really has
to do with it is we are saying that this Court should hold
to the position that we have tried to suggest and that is
that we should change the focus from the expression itself
to the conduct *

-

I am saying that there is just complete confusion
that has existed.

It clearly Is apparent In the many

petitions that this Court must receive in the trials below
arid the only value that the surveys have

were —• just merely,

I was commenting to Mr, Moran.*3 point and to let the Court
know that it wasn81 Just that point that the Abelson survey
was based on.

He Indicated that the whole report and the

conclusions of the majority were based upon this little
survey and the way they were asked a particular question.
Me again suggest to the Court —
Q

What do you mean by conduct? ■ As a matter of

factj, your brother asked us to do — asked the Court to do
exactly what you are asking us to do, focus on the conduct.
MB. SMITH:
Q

But he is talking of focusing —

And you are asking the same thing.

MR. SMITH:

— on the conduct of what is depicted

in the films.
Q

Well, I thought the conduct of conducting

a movie theatre is what ha was talking about.
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir.

I was talking about —

Mow, what are you talking about?

MR. SMITH:

The conduct that thrusts Itself upon

an unwilling public, the conduct that interferes with my right:
when I don’t want to view something.

And as I said,

your Honor, here is part of the problem now.

Mr. Justice

Burger asked —•
Q

You would limit It to that?

MR, SMITH:

I limit it to the situation, as I said,

where minors are involved and to those ways of dissemination

42
which intrude into the privacy of unwilling individuals.

When

there is an intrusion, then the definition of what Is obscene
becomes constitutionally relevant.
may say that

that

Some one ~~ some man

me Magazine, because it may

show two or three nudes*is obscene and writes the Post
Office and then the Post Office would make an analysis
whether,applying this Court’s definition, is it. obscene?
Sure the intrusion occurred.
Time.

They did not invite

That Is when it becomes relevant.
We say, your Honors, that these films do not —

are not as represented by Counsel here for the government.
They do contain sexually frank scenes but there are no
instances of sexual consummation explicitly portrayed,
Taking in part the words from the Rabe versus
Washington case, they don’t exist and this is part of the
problem.
Q

What if they did, would you — that doesn’t

come under your — that wouldn't be within either one of
your exceptions., anyway, would it? So what has that got to
do with your submission?
MR. SMITH: That is correct* and again, your Honor,
.;y brother, on the question of the procedure, Mr. Justice
Burger inquired regarding the procedure, how this came about,
what is the current procedure today?

And one of the things

I was pointing out was, and it was pointed out by my
brother — was an officer would

make an affidavit as to

43
what was being shown, but no two people can agree on what
v/as being shown.
The trial judge says it did not show explicit
sexual acts.

My brother says it does show explicit sexual

acts.
Q

1 understand your argument to be that that is

basically an irrelevant inquiry under your submissions that
it is parmissable in any event so long as there is not an
assault on the privacy of unwilling people and so long as
there it is not exposed to children.
MR. SMITH:

Is that your argument?

Yes, sir» right In the context of our

fourth argument,
Q

So this question Is irrelevant to your

argument 3 is it not?
MR. SMITH:

Irrelevant as to that argument in

point number four, yes, sir.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Smith.

Thank you Mr. Moran.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:35 o’clock p.m.s the case was
submitted.)
