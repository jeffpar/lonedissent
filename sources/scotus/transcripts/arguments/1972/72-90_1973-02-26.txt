MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court 1'1111 hear

arguments firct this morning 1n No. 72-90, United States
against Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.
Mr. Stone, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B, STONE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STONE:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
This is a corporate income tax case here on a writ
of

certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.

The

sole issue presented in the Government's petition for
certiorari is whether the respondent railroad is entitled to
take depreciation deductions with respect to certain properties
paid for by governmental agencies for the purpose of
improving safety in traffic flow at highway-railroad
intersections.
The issue is governed, as I shall explain, by
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which are no
longer applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
The resolution of this question of construction of the 1939
Code, however, will continue to affect tax returns filed for
many future years, especially with respect to the railroad
and utility industries because the

relevant amendments to

the 1954 Code do not apply to properties paid for as were

4

those 1n issue here prior to 1954 and most of these properties
have very long, useful lives, 1n some cases as many as 50 or
60 years .
The background of the properties with respect to
which Respondent seeks depreciation deductions here is as
follows:
Beginning in the early 1930's, Respondent and many
other railroads entered into agreements with var:!.ous state
governments for construction of facilities to :'..mpi•ove the
safety and traffic flow conditions at high,1ay-railroad
intersections .

The initial ar;reements bet1-1een the railroads

and the states provided that the states 11ould substantially,
thour;h not entirely, reimburse the railroads for those
facilities which it was the railroad's obligation to construct.
Shortly after these initial agreements ,-iere
reached, Congress passed a series of statutes 1·1hich authorized
the Federal Government to pay at least part of the state's
share of the construction costs of these facilities.

This is

set forth in the National Industry Recovery Act at 48 stat
195 section 203 and is a 1933 statute.
In the years following the initial agreements and
the initial authorj_zation of partial federal reimbUl'sement
of state expenses, the railroads, who presumably felt that
these facilities designed to improve highway traffic conditions
were tangential to the profitable operation of their railroad

5

business, displayed great reluctance to share 3ubstantally
in the construction costs and disputes between the railroads
and the states were quite frequent over allocation of the
costs.
In order to settle these di3putes, Congress passed
the Federal Highway Act of 1944 which was basically a 3teppedup version of the prior act and this act at•.thorized the

Federal Government to reimburse the states for the entire
costs of the facilities such as those at issue here, subject
only to the limitation that to the extent that the railroad
~,as deemed to receive direct benefit from these facilities,
it should reimburse the Federal Government on a prorated
basis up to a maximum of 10 percent of the cost of any
particular facility.
The result was that the states initially absorbed
all or most of the cost of the facilities for which they were
reimbursed by the Federal Government and the railroads paid
only so much as was deemed to reflect the benefit which the
railroad derived from the facilites and this could in no
event exceed ten percent of the cost.
Now, although there is some question as to whether
Respondent or the states have title to the facilities under
the terms of these agreements, the agreements do provide that
Respondent is obligated to maintain the facilities "directly
related to railroad use" such as railbridges and roadbeds and

6

tracks and the states are correspoadinr,ly required to maintain
the falilities directly related to motor vehicle use such as
highway bridges and approaches.
The majority of the Court of Claims here appears
to have assumed that the obligation to maintain these
facilities includes the obligation to replace worn-out
equipment.

Judge Davis found that a questionable proposition

but the Court of Claims appears to have found •;hat Respondent
had the obligation here to maintain and replace at least those
facilities most directly related to railroad use.
And at this point I should point out that the
governnent and Respondent appear to be in some disagreement
as to precisely the type of facilities 1/hich Respondent seeks
here to appreciate.
The Court of Claims did not make a specific finding
as to what percentage of the facilities at issue here were of
the type closely related to the railroad business and
correspondingly what percentage were closely related to
highway use and this would bear, for example, upon the question
of whether Respondent was obligated to maintain and replace
the facilities it seeks to depreciate, a question 11hich, to
be sure, we do not believe to be dispositive of thls case,
The Court did find -- and this finding is at page 55A
of our certiorari petition -- that about a million and a half
of the somewhat more than $2 million of property at issue here

7
was in the category of "highway undercrossings or hi17)lway
overcrossings."

We assumed, perhaps in some haste, that

highway undercrossings and hiBbway overcrossings refer to
highway facilities over railroad tracks and concluded on that
basis that at least 71 percent of the amount in controversy
represented facilities in the category most directly related
to highway use.
Judge Davis appears to have assumed the same ci1ing
and I refer you in that connection to footnote t1.o on page
48A of the petition.
Respondent now asserts in his brief that it is not
claiming any highway structures here and that the items in
its account six, which the Court of Claims described as
highway undercrossings, are in fact, railroad bridges of some
sort.
at page

In this connection, it cites the Joint exhibit found

51 of the Appendix in which the items in account six

are described simply as bridges.
Respondent claims that the bridges in this account
are rail bridges and that in spite of the finding of the
Court of Claims, it has not sought to depreciate any highway
undercrossings or overcrossings.
Now, our examination of the record in this case
including an inspection of the tax returns filed by
Respondent does not provide a satisfactory answer to the
question of whether the items in account six include highway

8

crossings and, if so, to what extent and the litigation has
I think quite rightfully not focused closely on this point.
\·/e felt it desirable to br:l.ng this discrepancy
between our reading of the Record and Respondent's assertion
to the Court's attention, but for reasons which I shall refer
to several times in the course of this argument, hopefully,
our position is in no way dependent upon the answer to the
question of whether the bulk of the facilities in question
were directly related to highway use or rail use.
Q

In that terminology, both highway overcrossing

and highl'lay undercrossing could refer to railroad structures.
They wouldn't necessarily include highway structures.
MR. STONE:

I think that's right.

They could,

f.!r. Justice Rehnquist and in that connection, it may have been
hasty of us to assume that it referred to hie-,hway structures.
I believe Judge Davis assumed the same thing because in this
footnote two on page 48A of the petition, he refers to the
fact that three-quarters of the structures in question were
those of the highway overcrossings or undercrossin~s and that
part of the agreements between the states and the railroads
included the condition that the railroads would not -- that
the states would not have to

pay for an easement with respect

to those structures and I assumed that if there is

any

question involved with the state applying for or requiring an
easement in order to make the construction, it would probably

9

refer to a highway construction 1·1hich it uas the state's
obligation to construct and not a rail construction.
isn't crystalclear either.

That

In any event, we don't believe

that this is at all dispositive of the issues in the case and
I shall have occasion to explain why in the course of the
argument .
I want to bring out one more bit of background to
this case.

In a series of events described at length in our

brief and in the opinion of the Court of Claims, Respondent,
as a condition to obtainin~ the permission of the Internal
Revenue Service to change its basic depreciation accounting
techniques, Respondent entered into a terms letter agreement
with the Internal Revenue Service in which Respondent promised,
among other things, that it would not talce depreciation
deductions w:!.th respect to properties that had been donated
to it and so for years Respondent declined to claim
depreciation deductions with respect to the assets at issue
here.
Suddenly, in 1965, Respondent brought a lawsuit in
the Court of Claims alleging that it overpaid its income
tax for the Year 1955 and that is the year at issue here, when
it failed to talce depreciation deductions on these properties
paid for by the government and the Court of Claims held by a
margin of four to three, with Judge Davis dissenting
vigorously, that Respondent was indeed entitled to include the

10

value of these properties in its depreciation base and to take
deductions though it had incurred no cost in the

acquisition

of these assets.
Q

Mr. Stone, there are other cases backed up

behind this one, aren't there, involving other railroads?
MR. STONE:
Q

Yes, there are, Hr. Justice .tHackmun .

Do those cases have a terms letter 1·1rinlcle too,

as this one does?
l•ffi. STONE:

I'm not sure whether all of them do,

!•fr. Justice Blackmun, but I'm told that the terms letter

agreements were very widespread in the railroad industry.
They were basically involved in the post-Second World War
changes from retirement depreciation accountinB and I'm told
that that wa:l such a widespread practice due to the fact there
were such low retirements and high profits during the Second
World War most railroads and most industries generally did
their accounting on the basis of -- did their accounting on
the basis of retirement but it became much more profitable
after the war to do it on the basis of straight depreciation
technique.
But I don't know specifically if there are any cases
baclc up right n01-, which do not involve the terms letter.
In deciding the issue in Respondent's favor, the
Court of Claims held both that the depreo1at1on deductions
uere allowable under the applicable provisions of the 1939 Code

11
and that in addition, Responuent had not given up its right
to take depreciation deductions on donated properties when
it entered into these terms letter agreements.
It is our position that even if the 1939 Code
allowed Respondent a depreciation deduction in these
circumstances, which 11e certainly believe it did not,
Respondent was precluded f1•om taking these deductions as a
result of the binding terms letter agreement it entered
into.

This is a question of contract interpretation

essentially,

It is quite thoroughly covered in our brief

and I shall focus

my

attention in this argument on the

primary question with respect to which we oought certiorari
here which is 11hether Respondent is entitled undei:' the terms
of the 1939 Code to take deductions in these circumstances
for the depreciation of properties in which it has incurred
no costs.
The fundamental concept of the depreciation
deduction -- and this is virtually an axiom -- since its
inception has been that taxpayers deduct from taxable income
that portion of their assets which is used up in earning that
income.

The deduction for depreciation is essentially an

expense deduction.

It is designed to reflect approximately

that portion of the taxpayer's expense incurred in the purchase
of its assets which is attributable to the production of
income in any particular year.

12

Accordingly, both the 1939 and 1954 Internal
Revenue Codes provide that the basis on which depreciation
is allowed is the same as the basis for determining gain or
loss in disposition of the property and, in most instances,
this is the expense that the taxpayer has incurred in
purchasing the asset which is, of course, the taxpayer's
cost~
If an asset has cost the taxpayer nothing, its
gradual consumption represents no e>:pense to him and there is
ordinarily no reason to give him an expense deduction.
Now there are, to be sure, certain refinements of
the general rule that the depreciation basis is the taxpayer's
cost.

In certain situations, for example, the tax laws have

historically provided that a taxpayer to whom assets are
transferred in certain well-defined types of transactions
takes over the basis of the transferor rather than acquiring
a new basis and this is known commonly as a "carry-over basis."
This is true, for example, where a taxpaper receives
property in a transfer which the code characterizes as a gift.
There is also a carryover of the transferor's basis
in many situations in which property is transferred to a
corporation by its shareholders, for example.

Section 358 of

the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides a classic example
of a carryover basis which is a carryover basis for property
transferred to a corporation in a Section 351 transfer which

13
is transfer in exchange for stock or securities in a
corporation controlled by the transferors.
The reasons for providing a carryover basis in
these situations are various and they are quite complex and
would not fruitfully be explored ln the context of this
argument.

But I would suggest that close analysis justifies

the conclusion that these provisions do not really represent
departures from the notion that basis is fundamentally a
function of cost.
Rather, these special provisions reflect the
legislat1 ve view that in certain circumstances, well-defined
and for certain reasons, the purposes of the Code are most
consistently and effectively carried out l'lhen the basis of an
asset is unchanged in the hands of a transferee.
Or, if you \'1111, when the cost basis of someone
else 111thin the transf'ee taxpayer is the most appropriate
basis.
Now, what is the situation that you deal with here?
Section ll3AAB of the 1939 Code provided that
corporate taxpayers could take over their transferors basis,
a carryover basis; 1n this case, to be sure, the assets we
are dealing with are new and so the question is not one of
l'lhether it is a carryover basis or a taxpayer's cost basis
because those are one and the same.

The question is simply

whether the taxpayer takes over any basis at all on these

14
assets.
Section ll3AAB provided that corporate taxpayers
could take the transferor's basis including for purposes of
depreciation in property transferred as "a contribution to
capital" and that is the term we are dealing nith here.
Ordinarily that term, "contribution capital" refers
to transfer of money or other property to a corporation by a
shareholder.
In this situation, the

contribution to capital is

quite logically considered a part of the shareholder's
investment in his equity interest in the corporation and it is
treated much the same way as consideration paid, for example,
for the issuance of stock.
But the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 did not
restrict the right to acquire a basis and, correspondingly, to
depreciate assets donated as contributions to capital to
assets donated by shareholders,

It simply provided that the

corporation acquired the transferors basis in a contribution
to capital.
Consequently, it appears that the 1939 Code
contemplated that non-shareholders could also make contributions
to a corporation's capital and that the corporation could
take over the transferors basis in these assets for
depreciation purposes.
Sienificantly, by virtue of this Court's holding in

15
Edwards against Cuba Railroad at 268

U.S. , a property transfer

in these circumstances was held not to constitute income to
the transferee corporation.

Nonetheless, under the 1939

Code, corPorate taxpayers who received donated assets which
could be categorized as contributions to capital 11ere able
to take depreciation deductions \-11th respect to these assets
in which they had no investment and which they had received
entirely free of income tax liability.
Congress changed the situation when it enacted the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954.Section 362C of the current
Code provides that contributions to capital made by nonwbareholders after June 1954 have a basis of zero for
depreciation and other purposes in the hands of the transferees
so that the basis is no longer carried over from the transferor.
But for cases such as this one 11hich involved assets
transferred before the application of the applicable date of
Section 362, it is still necessary to inquire whether the
transfering question can be classified as a contribution to
capital within the meaning of Section 113 A8 of the 1939 Code.
Let me make it clear that we are not in any way
whatsoever implying that Respondent should be deprived of
a benefit which the 1939 Code provides to him.

We are not

attempting to make the amendments contained in Section 362 of
the 1954 Code retroactive because they are explioitly made
prospective in application only.

16
The specific issue in this case, however, is the
definition of the term "contribution to capital" us used in
Section 113AAB of the 1939 Code and that term is not defined
in the Code.

As I have indicated, it is a term ordinarily

associated with transfers by shareholders or persons with
underlying equity interests in a corporation.
The question 1n this case is, what does the term
"contribution to capital" mean in the context of a transfer
to a corporation by a nonsha.?•eholder?
I-11th respect to this question, we believe that it is
highly relevant to understand that the allowance of a
depreciation basis in these circumstances was a departure
from the traditional notion of depreciation as a reflection
of expense, expense actually incurred as an asset is used up
and we believe it is reasonable to conclude from the context
that the term "contribution to capital" was not intended to
apply to all transfers made to a corporation without immediately
apparent consideration but that the term was intended to
have a rather specific meaninr; and it is that meaning which
we are attempting to cover here.
Indeed, we submit that the decisions of this Court
rendered while Section 113AAB was still in effect have
interpreted the term "contribution to capital" in the context
of nonshareholder transfers in a very specific and limited
wa;y.

17
Essentially, we deal with t1m cases in which this
Court specifically considered whether transfers of assets to
a corporation by a nonshareholder constituted contributions
to capital.
In both of these two cases, the Court tested the
assets in question in terms of the donative intent of the
transferor, specifically in terms of whether the transferors
intention was to increase the

corporation's capital, whether

he 11as making a contribution to the corporation's capital.
Thus, in the Detroit Edison case, decided in 1943
at 319 U.S., the taxpayer 11as a utility company which claimed
depreciation deductions with respect to electric power lines
which its customers had been required to pay for in order to
induce the company to provide its services in that neighborhood.

The Court held that the taxpayers customers had not

contributed these assets to taxpayers capital.
Justice Jackson said at 319 U.S. 102, "It overtaxes
imagination to regard that the farmers and other customers who
furnished these funds as makers either of donations or
contributions to capital.

The payments were to the customer

the price of service."
Then, in 1950, seven years after Detroit Edison,
the Court decided the second case construing the term
"contribution to capital" in the context of nonshareholder
transfers and that case is the Brown Shoe Company case

18
decided at 339 U.S.

In that case and it is a fairly standard

model for a whole group of cases, community citizen groups
which were intending to induce the taxpayer to locate its
operations in that community for the purpose of generating
economic benefit to the community donated factory buildings
and other assets for use in the construction of the taxpayers
basic new plant facilities.

The use of the asset3 was

unrestricted except that they were to be uced in the taxpayer's
business at that location for a specified period of time.
The Court in that case noted that the intent of the
community groups 1·1as immediately to add assets to taxpayer's
working capital without imposing restrictions and the Court
held that the transfers, and I quote, "Manifested a definite
purpose to enlarge the l'torking capital of the company" end of
quote for which reason the Court distinguished the Detroit
Edison case where the transfers had been made by customers
in compensation for service and held that the transfers
constituted depreciable contributions to capital under the

1939 Code.
Now, where does this case fit in the spectrum between
Detroit Edison, where the Court found that the donations were
intended as payment for services rather thap as contributions
to enlarge the taxpayer's capital and Brotm Shoe

where the

Court held that the donations made to induce taxpayer to
locate its plant in a particular area were intended to increase

19
the taxpayer's capital.
The Court of Claims in this case recognized that
the governmental agencies 11hich contributed to the highuayrailroad facilities at issue -- or let us more properly say,
1·1hich paid for the facilities at issue

did not intend to

enlarge Respondent's working capital 1n any way.
Well, the Court specifically found that, quote,
"The facilities were constructed primarily for the benefit
of the public to improve safety and to expedite highway
traffic flow." That finding is at page 5711. of the petition.
The Court found further that the transferors were
motivated entirely by considerations of highuay safety and
convenience and that they gave no consideration to Respondent's
need for capital.
Nonetheless, the Court held that the instant case
was controlled by Brown Shoe rather than by Detroit Edison
and that transfers were contributions to capital.

Its reasons,

and they are amplified by Taxpayer in its brief, reflect in
our view incorrect interpretation of these two cases and an
excessively broad reading of the term "contribution to
capital."
To begin with, both the Court of Claims and
Respondent sei&e upon the reference in Detroit Edison to the
fact that the power lines were contributed by taicpayer's
customers in order to attain taxpayer's services.

They

20

seize upon this language and in spite of the Court's emphasis
on Detroit Edison on the lack of intention to enlarBe the
company's working capital, they would restrict the application
of that holding to situations 11here the properties i;'l question
are paid for as compensation for services.

They set up an

either/or test.
Conversely, the Court of Claims and Respondent would
read Brown Shoe, and this :!.s nearly incredible in view of the
language of that case, not to require a findinc or intent
to enlarr,e taxpayer's capital.
Under their argument, a transfer to a corporation
without obvious considera'cion con::ititutes a contribution
to capital unless it can be categorized as compensation for
services.

This is a very broad conception of the term

contribution to capital.

It is rather cleverly contrived

to fit the facts of this case in which the assets were
clearly, as the Court of Claims found, not donated 11ith
intention of enlarging or contributing to taxpayer's
capital but in which the transfers also cannot be categorized
as payment for services.
We simply do not see how this conclusion can be
reconciled uith the opinions in these cases or, indeed, with
the whole statutory scheme governing the depreciation and the
production and, indeed, there is a vital aspect of the case
bearing quite specifically on this question of intention which

21

is ignored by the Court of Claims altogether but which makes
it even clearer perhaps than in the Detroit Edison case that
no contribution has been made to taxpayer Respondent'e
capital.
In Detroit Edison, the pouer lines which the
taxpayer's customers donated to it, though they were not, to
•
be sure, transfer:,:,ed \;1th the intention of expan<ling the
company's capital, were at least assets Hh1ch were directly
beneficial and relevant to the taxpayer's business, assets
which in fact n:ade substantial addition to the taxpayer's
corporate capital.
Here in this case, as the Court found, the assets
were only tangentially related to Respondent's business.

The

contribution was worth very little to the extent that there
was any at all. 'l'hough an increased safety at highuay railroad crossinc;s is a goal that no one preoumably would oppose,
it is not especially relevant to the profitability of the
railroad business, a fact \·1hich is doubtless reflected in the
railroad company's constant resistance to sharing in the
cost of these facilities.
This resistance is what resulted in Congress'
authorization of total federal reimbursement for the facilities
subject to the ten percent maximum pay-back by the railroads
and, indeed, this is perhaps the most significant fact in
the case.

To the extent that Respondent was deemed to benefit

22

to receive any tangible benefit from the construction of the
facilities in issue here, he Has required to pay for them,
Nothing 11as contributed.

Whatever the Ilespondent was deemed

to have benef1tted from, he paid for.
I talce 1 t everyone agrees that Respondent is
entitled to depreciate any portion of these assets which
it may have had to pay for.

The acreements specified, as I

have said earlier, that this benefit 1·1as not to exceed ten
percent of the cost of the facilities and this is presumably
a reflection of the party's ,j udgreent, of the legislative
judg11ent that the facilities were not 1'inanc:!.ally important
to the railroads.
Indeed, testimony befo1•e the Couri; of Claims
Hearing Commissioner -- and I point specifically to page 76
of the Appendix -- indicated that the railroads frequently
asserted in arguing how much of the cost they would have to
bear that the benefit they enjoyed amounted really to

only

one or two percent of the cost, total cost of the facilities
and it did not seem to matter for this purpose whether the
facilities were of a type directly related to rail use or the
type directly related to highway use.
In sW!I, these assets with respect to which
Respondent

seeks depreciation now, were neither transferred

in consideration of Respondent's services, as in Detroit
Edison, nor were they contributions to Respondent's capital

23
as in Brown Shoe.

The railroads and the governmental agencies

here have merely apportioned among themselves the costs of
improving traffic flow at highvray-railroad intersections.
Their respective shares of these costs reflect the
relative benefit that the railroads and the government
representing the people respectively derive from tl:e aa3ets.
In the case of the railroad, this is not much
benefit and other railroads don't pay much but neither can it
be said that these governnental. ap,encies, in absorllinc; the
share of the costs

which reflects the public's interests in

these assets, it cannot be said that they have contributed or
donated that share of the costs to Respondent's capital.
Essentially, it may be helpful to think in terms
in which Respondent
two persons 1·1ho

and these agencies are simply like any

share a cost together in proportiQns which

reflect their respective interests in an asset.

Tl'lo adjoining

landowners, for example, may decide to construct a .fence
or dig a well together.

They might find it convenient to

locate the fence or the well on one side or the otl~r of
their property line.

Presumably their appo1•tionment of the

cost of this asset will. reflect their respective uses of the
facilities.
The landowner on whose side of the line the well
is dug or the fence erected has certainly not received a
donation from his neighbor and cannot include his neighbor ' s

24
cost 1n his depreciation basis.
This is essentially, we believe, the nature of the
case here.
We would add, finally, that the ereat emphasis
placed in Respondent's brief on the fact that it l'las obligated
to maintain some -- or, 1t argues, all of the facilities.

It

may or may not be true that it has this obligation but it is
irrelevant to the question of depreciability and irrelevant to
the question of whether this is a contribution to capital
becau~e -- I'll say relevant, the question 1s certainly not
dependent upon it.

Depreciation, as 1s 1·1ell-kno~m, 1s an

expense deduction for a current expense.

It 1s not an

anticipation of a future expense and a cost which the taxpayer
has never incurred .•
'fhe taxpiyer

cites in this regard certain cases in

11h1ch 1t is unclear who has made the underlying investment
in an equity asset and in those cases it has been l'Clevant
to inquire who h:ts the maintenance obligation in so far as
that sheds evidence on the question of who is the under lyi ng
o~mer or has the underlying cost basis in the asset.

But t he

mere obligation to undertake a speculative futu:re expense
is not under any circumstances to give rise to a depr eciation
deduction.
For these reasons, we believe that this decision
ought to be reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stone.

Mr. Schreiber.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. SCHREIBER, ESQ.,
ON BEHIU,F OF THE RESPOJIDEWl.'

MR. SCHREIBER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
We feel that the significant difference in the
factual apporach taken by Petitioner and Respondent is decisive
of the 01.1tcorne of this co.se.

We submit that the obligation of

replacement of these facilities is the critical factor in
the determination as to whether or not Respondent is entitled
to these depreciation deductions.
The findinc of the Court below is clear that
Respondent had this obligation in connection with the 173
facilities that we are talking about here today.
no,.,, what are these facilities?

They are simply

railroad bridges, rail orossing protective devices that are
located on Respondent's rightof1tay which it has the obligation
to maintain and to replace.
Now, we say we have the lagal obligation of
replacement of these facilities.

In addition, we have a

very real practical obligation because the rail bridge over
the public highway is a vital link in our traneportation
system.

If we are furnishing common oarrier service to the

public, each one of these locations is essential to that

26
operation.

Therefore, we feel that there is a definite need

to set up a depreciation reserve both from an accounting
standpoint in order to anticipate replacement and from the
very real practical situation of replacing those bridees as
they became inoperable and needed replacement.
Q

In the Detroit Edison case, did th:;, ut:!.1.1.ty

company have the obligat~on to naintain and, if necessary,
replace those pouer lines, or doo;;n't that appear in the
opinion?
MR. SCHREIBER:

I don't believe it appears ,

Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think it probably could be
assumed that if they wanted to continue in business that they
1·1ould have to replace this facility although it was not part
of the agreement betueen the prospective customer and the
Detroit Edison Company.
Q

But the lines became the property of the

utility company of Detroit Edison.

rm. SCHREIBER:
Q

Yes, they did, !-Ir. Justice.

And presumably they had the same obligations

as your client does in this case, didn't they?
In any event, the Court didn't put any weight on
that at all.

Didn't even mention it.

MR. SCHREIBER:

Not in the Detroit Edison case,

Mr. Justice, but we feel that the legal obligation and the
practical obligation of replacement that we have makes

our

27

case more persuasive for justifying a claim for depreciation
deductions on 113 AAB than the Brown Shoe case.
Q

Your point is that exactly tho same obligation

might have existed in the Detroit

for all 11e know, did

exist in the Detroit Edison case and yet the Court didn't, as
I say, find that -- if it ,-,ere true -- find it persuasive at
all.
MR. SCHREIBER:

No, because of the overriding

consideration that the payments from the prospective
customers in Detroit Edison
Q

Were part of the cost of services.

MR. SCHREIBER:
Q

Or part of the price of services.

MR. SCHREIBER:
Q

Richt.

Yes, that is correct.

Rightly or wrongly, the court doesn't seem,

in other words, in either case, neither the Detroit Edison
nor Bro,m Shoe to have considered the factor that ypu are now
talking about as dispositive either way.

Isn't that

true,

in Brown Shoe the Court laid stress on the fact that the
purpose who gave the assets was to benefit Brown Shoe and
indirectly, therefore, to benefit the community,

Isn't that

right?
MR. SCHREIBER:

We feel that the teaching of the

Brown Shoe case was that the contributions made by the local
citizen groups to the Bro~m Shoe Company to benefit the public

28
at large
Q

Right.

MR. SCHREIBER:

-- in other words, to create

additional job opportunities.
Q

In the community through Brown Shoe.

MR. SCHREIBER:

Yes.

And the means they used to

achieve this publis purpose was to make these contributions
to the working capital of the taxpayer.

We feel \;hat that is

strictly analagous to the factual situation we have here.

T'ne

primary purpose of the Federal Aid Highway /\ct i·1as to benefit
the public at large by enlarr,ine; the network of hir.;hways and
also to increase safety at these intersections bet11een highl'lays
and railroads.
!101·1,

the means that the government chose to use to

reach this laudable objective was to make these contributions
to this taxpayer in order to benefit the public but in so
doing, did so by contributing to our working capital.
In fact, I might enlarge on that just a bit.

The

agreements between the Respondent and -- it was the local or
state governmental unit -- provided for the construction of
these railroad bridges and these rail crossing protective
devices and subsequent to that, the Respondent taxpayer was
then reimbursed in cash through the Federal Aid Highway
Program.
So the initial expenditure was out of Respondent's

29
working capital to fund the construction of these projects and
then this caoh that went to the construction of these facilities
1·1as reimbursed directly into Respondent's worlting capital.
Q

Mr. Schreiber, I'm not sure it ia important or

even relevant, but in recent times, at least, spur traclts off
a railroad yard running into industry pick up their freicht
have been constructed at the cost -- by the railt·oad l>ut at
the cost of the industry.
I/hat do the railroads do about that?

Do they

claim depreciation on those spur tracks?
MR. SCHREIBER:
Q

Well --

Industry tracks?

MR. sc1mEIBER:

The industry tracks, if the payment

is made initially by the prospective customer without any
right of reimbursement, that money would never appear in
Respondent's accounts because it is assumed that they

the

prospective customer is paying for that right to have the
track in there to serve his business.
Q

Isn't that quite a bit like Detroit Edison?

MR. SCHREIBER:

That is more like Detroit Edison

than the instant fact situation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

How would you distinguish it?

Tell me how

you think that is distinguishable, in what respect, t'rom your
case.
MR. SCHREIBER:

The spur track situation?

It is

30
different becauoe there the prospective customer is making a
payment in order to obtain services that mir;ht not otherwise
be available to lt.

Unleos there is a legal oblic;ation on

the Respondent to construct facilitie::;, it is within its
discretion as to whether or not it will do so and that is
comparable to the Detroit Edison case.
Here, llr. Chief Justice, 1·1e have a situation where
t~is

Re~pondent railroad had~ preexisting lec;al obligation

to construct these facilities in accordance with the lawo of
the states in which we operate.

The state regulatory

cor.unissions did, and frequently did, issue order£ requiring
railroads to construct these types of facilities on their
property.
Generally, that \'las done as a result of a petition
from residents of a local community.

If they uanted a signal

liV)t or a crossing gate at a particular location in their
town, they would go down to the State Public Service Commission
and, as a result of the proceedings there, we were frequently
ordered, as the record below indicates, to construct these
facilities.

So there 11as a preexisting legal obligation on

Respondent to construct these facilities which distinguishes
it from the situation in Detroit Edison case and from the
situation in regard to the spur track,
Q

When a spur track is constructed, who owns it?

Who has title to it?

31
MR. SCHREIBER:

The title would be dependent on

l'lhether or not the track 1·1as sold on the prospective
customer's property or whether it was on railroad right-of- way.
If it was on railroad right,-of-way, the title, legal title
would assume to be in the railroad.

But if it was on, as

most of the siting tracks for serving customers at plant
facilities are located within that particular plant facility
area -Q

Some part of it is always on the right-of-way

of the railroad, is it not?
MR. SCHREIBER:

Probably the lead-in, ;1r. Chief

Justice, would be in order to get into the property line.

It

would have to be.
Q

But the railroads don't claim any depreciation

for that part.
MR. SCHREIBER:

Well, the prospective company would

only be paying for the track that is located on its property.
In other words, the side

track up to a door in the side of

its building in order to serve that particular company.

The

what we call a "turn-out" from the rail track off the railroad
right of way to the property line of the plant, would be our
cost.

And, of course, the -Q

What happens if 50 years from now the viaduct

on such and such a road collapses and Just wears out and
several of them wear out and Burlington says,

11e

oan' t afford

32
to build it, to rebuild it and the government says, okay,
we'll do like we did before.
MR. SCHREIBER:

We'll give you the money.

You mean in rer;ard to the possible

reconstruction of the bridges and of crossing signal
protection devices?
Well, if that were to be the case, and of course we
certainly hope it won't be the case in connection with the
taxpayer, that would be a situation that would have to be
determined at that time.
Q

But as of today, we have that --

Nell, could the government deduct from what

they give you hoit much you've depreciated in those last 50
years?
MR, SCHREIBER:

Could they -- Mr. Justice, I -- I

don't have the answer to that question as to ~1hether they
could or not.
Q

If, by congressional action -Would it be fair for them to do that?

MR, SCHREIBER:

From the standpoint and perspective

of fairness, it might very well be fair and reasonable if at
some future date, due to a collapse of a particular railroad,
the obligation was placed back on the government to replace
these facilities to offset the depreciation deductions claim,
However, if that situation
Q

By that time, all that money is gone.

MR, SCHREIBER:
Q

Right?

Pardon me?

By that time, all that depreciation

33
money that you got back is gone now, isn't it?

50 years

from now?
MR. SCHREIBER:

Well, it's gone in the sense that it

was available to the taxpayer but if in your situation the
taxpayer railroad is becoming bankrupt, it t1ouldn I t have any
taxable income so :l.t wouldn't be able to achieve any benefit
from the deduction.
Q

We 11, I

didn't r-.ean bankrupt, I meant it was

scooting along as it was in the •6o•s.
!·ffi. SCHREIBER:
Q

to

Well, as long

BB

it is still viable

Well, you had to go to -chc Federal Government

get the money, didn I t you?

And you weren I t bankrupt .

Am

I rir;ht?
HR. SCHREIBER:

This - - the Federal Aid Higl'll'1ay

Act of 1933 and the subsequent amendments thereto 1·1ere
provided for the primary purpose of benefitting the public
by enlarging the highway network and also to provide these
safety facilities at high
Q

Why,is the taxpayer taking money for

depreciation benefitting the public?
MR. SCHREIBER:

The taxpayer claiming his legitimate

right to depreciation deductions is exercising the r1t,ht that's
provided by statute.
Q

But he isn't benefitting the public, is he?

MR. SCHREIBER:

But the project itself had the

34
primary purpose to benefit the public, although that is true.
As I've indicated before, the question is the means that were
utilized to achieve this primary purpose.
You, I guess, started to say soriething else in

Q

response to

my

question.

MR. SCHREIBER:

Cortinue.
In regards to the track itself, the

track is a nondepletiable item from the standpoint of straichtline depreciation so therefore the depreciation on the tracks
ls -- is not an issue here.

It is only those items that we

claim are entitled to straightline depreciation.
Q

Railroad tracks are not depreciable?

MR. SCHREIBER:

Under straightline depreciation.

They are under retirement accounting, Mr. Justice.
Q

I see.

f.lR. SCHREIBER:

Now, we submit that the issue here

involves clearly and simply a question of the proper
statutory construction of Section 113 of the 1939 Internal
Revenue Code.
Now, the section we are relying upon is Section 113
A8B which provides for the transferee to assume the basis or
the transferor on payments made by shareholders as paid in
surplus or from any other person as spelled out in the
regulations and in the statute itself.
Now, this distinguishes the situation furthermore
from the Detroit Edison case because under Section 113A8B,

35

there is no necessity for a requirement of donative intent
as there would be under Section 113A2, which is the gift
provision and permits the donee to acquire the donor's basis.
The donative intent only is of significance in connection with
an interpretation of 113A2.
No1·1, as I have indicated previously, tie feel that
this case is controlled by this Court's 1950 decision in the
Bro~m Shoe case.
Now, the logic and the rationale of this Court's
decision in the Brown Shoe case is equally applicable in
connection 11ith our case.

The facts are parallel.

The primary

intent was to benefit the public at large, both in Brown Shoe
and in this case.
Secondly, the payments in the Brown Shoe case and in
this case were not payments for goods or services to be
rendered as they were in the Detroit Edison case.
Finally -Q

Wasn I t there the difference that in Brown Shoe

perhaps the industry would not have come into the area at all
except for the contribution?
MR. SCHREIBER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice

that -Q

Is that true here?

MR. SCHREIBER:

That is not the same factual

situation here because we had this preexisting legal obligation

36
to construct these facilities, yes, sir.
Q

So you didn't have any option about it that

Bro~m Shoe had?
MR. SCHREIBER:

That's 1·1hy \le feel. nr. Chief

Justice, that the facts in this case are more persuasive to
justify a claim under Section 113 A8B.
Bro11n Shoe Company agreed to maintain th:ls new
, facility or to renovate a facility l'lithin that community
only for an initial period of ten years.

Now, c.t the

expiration of that ten-year period, Brown Shoe Conpany could
pick up a.'ld move on and, co11cei val:>ly they did.
Here, 11e had

the obligation of replace1:1ent on a

continuing basis if we intended to continue an operation as
an interstate railroad .
That, as I was indicatine, is the distinguishine
characteristics, we feel, between Detroit Edison on the one
hand and Bro~m Shoe and the factual situation in this case on
the other hand.
Now, I'll just mention briefly in Petitioner's
argument, as part of the overall revision of the 1954 Internal
Revenue Code, Section 362C was added to apply a zero basis to
these types of contributions but to do so on a prospective
fashion only as to those facilities constructed subsequent to
June 22, 1954 and the facilities that we are talking about
here today, these rail bridges, these rail crossi ng safety

37

devices, were all constructed prior to the cut-off date
provided for in Section 362c of the 1954 Code.
It is clear also, from the legislative history of
Section 362C, that it was intended to overcome the effect of
the Brown Shoe case but to do so in a prospective fashion
only.
Congress had it within its discretion to apply this
revision of the Code provided for in Section 362C both in a
retroactive manner -- if it deemed it prudent and advisable
or in a prospective manner.

They chose to do it in a

prospective fashion only.
No\/, the Commissioner and the government are coming
into Court here and saying that regardless of 11hat the
Congressional intent was, this '54 Code revision should now
ue applied retroactively to factual situations that Congress
specifically excluded when it amended the Code.
Now, I thin!~ it is clear that as a general principle
of law that no retroactive effect is to be given to a
statutory amendment unless it is explicitly required by the
terms and conditions of that statutory amendment.

Here, the

case is quite to the contrary that it was to operate
prospectively only.
Therefore, we assert that our rights to these
depreciation deductions have matured exclusively under
Section 113 of the 1939 Code and, specifically, Section ABB.

38

Finally, I'd just like to touch briefly on the
so-called "terms letter defense" of Petitioner which we have
been faced with throughout the trial of the case in the
Court of Claims and on appeal to the Court below.
Petitioner asserts that certain illustrative
language out of the so-called "mimeo 58 guidelines" is a bar
to our claim for depreciation deductions in this case.
Briefly, what transpired here is that in 1944, pursuant to a
request by the taxpayer for a changeover in method of
depreciation accounting from retirement accountin~, straightline depreciation accountinr, revised -- or schedules 11ere
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service and an offer of a
terms letter agreement to consent to this chan~e-over in
accounting was sent to the taxpayer.
Included in that terms letter in 1945 was the
document that has been referred to "mimeo 58 cuidelines."
It is our position, number one, that mimeo 58 guidelines were never a part of the terms letter agreement bet1·1een
REspondent and the Commissioner.

They were not incorporated

either by reference or otherwise into the terms letter offer
between

Respondent and Commissioner.
Then, upon receipt of the terms letter offer from

the Commissioner, Respondent replied with a qualified
acceptance indicating that in the event that any of the terms
and conditions should be changed by statutory amendment, by

39

the operation of law or otherwise, that the taxpayer would
not be precluded from the benefits of such changes.
Now, considering the status of the law in regards to
these depreciation deductions in 191;5, it is clear why these
were not included in the schedule submitted

by

~eer,ondent to

the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
In 191!3, this Court decided the ~ o i t Edison case
and subsequent to that decision, the CommiGsioner beean to
disallow depreciation deductions to the Bro1m Shoe Company
based on the Detroit Edison case.
the la11suit

by

the Bro1m Shoe

Thn'~ is what initiated

Company to be allo1red to

claim these depreciation deductions and that issue was
resolved by this Court in 1950.

So from the period from

1943 to 1950, it was the position of the Commissioner and the
government that nobody was entitled to any dep1--eciation
deductions on contributions to capital similar to those at
is3ue in Brotm Shoe and here.
Therefore, it ,.,ould have been a meaninr;less act for
us to, as a result of a request for change-over in accounting,
raise the issue when that was the current understanding or the
Commissioner and the government.
The terms letter itself and the mimeo 58 both
specifically were qualified to indicate that depreciation
was to be in accordance with Section 113 of the 1939 Internal
REvenue Code in the regulations issued thereunder.

40

Therefore, once it became clear as a result of this
Court's decision in the Brown Shoe case that contributions of
this nature uere properly depreciable, it effected a chanBe
in the terms and conditions of the terms letter agreement
between Respondent and Commissioner and justified our claim
for depreciation deductions, even if the mimeo 58 p:uidelines
could be considered as even partially incorporated into the
terms letter offer from the Commissioner to Respondent.
Finally, in conclusion, Respondent would like to
assert it's a very simple, factual situation we are dealing
with here in this case.

\'lhat we are talking about are rail-

road bridges, rail safety facilities that are directly
related to the operation of plaintiff's railroad; that we
have the legal and practical obligation of replacement of
these facilities if, as we do,continue to desire to stay in
business as an interstate railroad.
Further, the government should not be allowed, as
a result of this litigation, to apply a statutory amendment in
a retroactive fashion when Congress, although it had it
within its discretion to do so, failed to do so.
And, finally, we assert that the so-called terms
letter defense cannot be successfully used to defeat a valid
claim of this taxpayer on the substantive issue of its
entitlement to depreciation deductions when the illustrative
language relied upon by Petitioner is included in a m1meo 58

41
guideline enclosure to the terms letter agreement t-1hich is
qualified by providine that all applicable sections of the
39 Code will govern the situation in reeard to depreciation
and when Respondent's acceptance of the terms letter agreement
was so qualified to preserve its legal rights to contest the
legitimacy or these depreciation deductions in a proper form
by a timely claim for refund which is precisely uhat
Respondent did successfully, both in the Trial Court and
before the Court of Claims on review.
If there are no further questions, thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice and the Court.

r-rn.
