MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-1665» United States against Cartwright.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a federal estate tax case.

It is here on

a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

It involves one

of those narrow but recurring questions which have no place
to come for final decision except here and which arrive here
only after long continued litigation and multiple decisions
in the lower court.
The question relates to the value to be assigned to
mutual fund shares held by the estate of a decedent.
•Specifically it involves the validity of Section 20.1031-8(b)
of the Treasury regulations on estate tax which is printed at
pages 25 and 26 of our brief, beginning at the bottom of page
25.

It provides, and 1 quotes

“The fair market . value of

a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as
a Mutual .fund') is the public offering price of a share."
And then there is a final clause which is not
relevant, "adjusted for any reduction in price available to

4

the-public in acquiring the number of shares being valued»1'
But the significant part is that the regulation
provides thatthe fair market value of a share in an open-end
investment company is the public offering price of a share,
Q

Mr» Solicitor General, prior to the issuance

of that regulation however, the Department of Justice did not
go off—

where there was no regulation and no officially stated rule.

October 10, 1963, by final approval by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
and publication in the Federal Register as a Treasurydecision—why it provides at the bottom of page 26 in our
l

brief, "The provisions of this paragraph shall apply with
respect to estates of decedents dying after October 10, 1963.”
Q

The public offering price is-—

MR. GRISWOLD:

The public offering price is the

price at which the distributor sells the shares.
price which is stated in a prospectus.

It is the

close arrangement between the distributor and the investment
company itself.
value.

The investment company receives the net asset

The distributor receives the addition which, in this

case, is usually about eight percent, often referred to as the
load.

And a way to look at it and one to which I shall

return is that the public offering price is the retail price
at which the shares are sold to the public.
Q

Except when offered at any other price.

MR. GRISWOLD:

They not only are never offered at

any other price by the distributor, but the—
Q

Or by the company.

MR. GRISWOLD:

Or by the company.

They could be

offered by you or me, if we owned them, at another price.
But the industry has a built-in resale price maintenance
provision in the law from the beginning.

Section 22 of the

Investment Company Act provides that no principal underwriter
of such security and no dealer, which means anybody who is a
dealer, shall sell such security to any person except a
dealer, a principal underwriter, or the issuer, except at a
current public offering price described in the prospectus.
So that the public offering price is a unilateral price at
which it may be sold by a person who is subject to the

6
Investment Company Act, which means an underwriter or a
dealer.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, if you and I made a

deal for shares of IDs that I have, I take it that IDS would
accept their transfer?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice, X understand they

not only would but they must.

And apparently there are very

rare sales by one individual to another; they are discouraged
by the industry as much as possible, and they are impossible
to dealers because a dealer cannot sell except at the public
offering price.
Q

As a practical matter, would

not those

transactions likely be limited to very large blocks where
a

there would be a large saving?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Not necessarily.

They might be

sold between members of a family or friends or in some special
circumstance.
Q

The real incentive is in the big blocks in the

transaction, is it not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

There would be a substantial amount

involved in a big block, and a person who had a large block
would be reluctant to have them redeemed at the net asset
value if he could find some other way to do it.
Apparently it is still very difficult to sell them
by a private individual at anything approaching the public

7
offering price»

In this case, the decedent died on

December 4, .1964, somewhat more than a year after the new
regulation was put out so that the regulation was applicable.
Her executor valued the shares on her estate tax return at
the redemption price, the bid price or net asset value.

The

commissioner determined, in accordance with the regulations,
that the shares should be valued at their public offering
price, and he determined that a deficiency accordingly, that
difference is the load, usually about eight percent in an
open-end investment trust.

The executor

paid the additional

tax, filed a claim for refund, filed suit to recover the
tax, contending that the regulation is invalid.

And the

district court agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
The regulation has similarly been held invalid in
the Hinth Circuit in Davis against the United states, with
one dissent.

That case involves $600, and we did not seek

to bring it here because the question is here in this case.
On the other hand, the regulation has been upheld
in the Sixth Circuit in Ruehlraann against the Commissioner,
which affirmed a divided decision of the Tax Court of the
United States, and this Court denied certiorari several
years ago.

And the companion gift tax regulation has been

held valid by the Seventh Circuit in Iioy/ell^ against the
United States.

And similarly there has been some division in

the decisions of the district courts and the question is now

8
pending before the Tenth Circuit and the Court of Claims.
Q

In reference to the companion gift tax

regulation, what does the Internal Itavenue Service do in
measuring, for instance, a gift of IDS stock, to an eleemosynary
donee?

Do they give the value with the load charge or

without?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is my position, Mr. Justice, that

in determining the value of a gift of a mutual fund share to
a charity that under the analogy to the regulation, because
the regulation applies directly to estate tax and the gift
tax, that the amount of the deduction is the public offering
price, exactly the same figure for which we contend here.
I believe our opponents say that there is no
evidence that that is actually applied.
authorities.

I cannot cite clear

But it is our position that that is the

valuation which should be applied in determining the amount of
a gift tax deduction.
At first blush it may seem that the regulation goes
a little far.

It is contended vigorously that the most that

the estate can realize from the shares is the bid price or
what might be called the liquidating value.

But further

consideration, I think, shows that that argument is by no
means conclusive.
estates

Property is not ordinarily valued in

what can be realized from it.
For example, if the decedent owned Blackacre at an

9

agreed value of $100 ,,000, his estate could not ordinarily
realize the $100,000 from it„

It would be likely to have to

pay a commission on sale of, say, .$6000, six percent»

Yet

the value of Blackacre for estate tax purposes would
undoubtedly be $100,000 and not the $94,000 that could be
realized net on its sale.
And that I think on further reflection is right.
If they continue to hold Blackacre, do not sell it, it is
worth $100,000.

On the other hand, if they sell Blackacre

and have to pay a six thousand dollar commission on sale,
that commission is deductible and only the net amount would
be subject to estate tax,.
Q

The difference, however, is any, is that in

the one case it is a seller’s commission, and in the other
case it is a buyer’s commission.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes,

Mr. Justice, but I do not

think that really makes any difference, because I think that is
really the difference between a sale on a market and a
retail sale.
market.

When you sell real estate, you sell it on a

And similarly with respect to ordinary stocks and

bonds held by a decedent’s estate.

The value for estate

tax purposes would not be reduced by a commission on sales,
even though such a commission would reduce the amount which
could actually be realized on the sale of the shares.
In this case the load becomes a part of the retail

10

price, just as the retailers markup in a drugstore or a
grocery store becomes a part of the retail price, including a
portion of the markup which he devotes to a commission to
his sales people.

And yet the retail price would be the fair

market value of the property and would include the sales
commission.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, in your Blackacre

example one might sell through an agent but also one might
sell it privately and might realise the $100,000.

Is that

true with respect to a. share in a mutual fund?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is true if you can find a buyer

who will pay you the full price.

Experience and the record

show that that is a rare occurrence, though it does sometimes
occur.

The problem of disposing of the shares—-suppose you do

dispose of them at the net asset value.

Then you can deduct

the amount of the difference between the public offering
price and the net asset value as an administration expense
if you sell them in connection with the administration of the
estate.

So that you would only be taxed if you actually clo

sell them on the net figure.
On the other hand, if you do not sell them, you
have got something which costs the full amount in the on3.y
place where you can legally buy them and practically buy them.
The offering price is in fact the price at which large numbers
of these shares change hands every day from willing sellers to

willing buyers.

Thus, the record in this case includes

Exhibit Ilf, offered by the taxpayer, which shows the numbers
of shares sold for a number of different fiscal years for
each one of these three funds.
Exhibit 11 shows that in the fiscal year ended
October 31, 1965, which is the year in which the decedent
died, Investor Stock Fund sold
out to about

15,213,000 shares, which works

60,000 shares per day.

Investors Mutual sold 34,499,000 shares in the year
ended September 30, 1965.

That works out to

about 138,000

shares per day, which shows that there was a very large
number of willing buyers who were willing to pay the net
offering price at retail to sellers who were ready, willing,
and available to sell the shares at the public offering
price.
The third fund, Investors Selective Fund, was
considerably smaller.
applicable fiscal year.

It sold 1,500,000 shares during the
But even that would work out to

6,000 shares per day, which passed,

from willing sellers to

willing buyers.
This is vary persuasive evidence, it seems to me,
that the offering price is in fact the price at which these
shares freely transfer from a willing seller to a willing buyer,
or at least that the regulation which provides that they should
be valued on this basis, prospectively applied, is a proper one

12

for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make and should
be sustained by this Court.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, is it really accurate

to say that the fiduciary of an estate can find a willing
buyer at the public offering price?
MR. GRISWOLD:
that is necessary.

No, Mr. Justice, but I do not think

Perhaps this is as good a time as any to

bring in this Court's decision in Guggenheim against Ra;.:aui.n,
which involved a gift of a paid-up life insurance policy.

And

the contention was there made on behalf of the taxpayer that
the gift should be valued at the surrender value of the life
insurance policy, which is the only amount which the donee
could obtain either from the insurance company or from a bank
if it wanted to borrow on the policy.

And this Court held in.

Guggenheim against Rasquin that the proper value for gift
tax purposes was the cost of that policy.

This was the price

which would have to be paid in order to obtain such a policy.
It is, in effect, not the liquidating value, which the surrender
value would be, but the retail price of the policy.

And it

used as an analogy a gift by a man to his wife of a new
automobile.
Let us say that the automobile was a Cadillac which
cost $6500, for which he paid $6500.

He drove it to the

house in order to deliver it to his wife as a gift.

By that

time it was a used car and it could be turned in -fcoaa dealer

13
only for a sum considerably less than $6500.

But the

regulations have always provided that the value in such a case
is the retail price, the price which would have to be paid
for such an item.
Now let rae take, for example, these very mutual
fund shares.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General,, the regulations have

always provided that, but it is not without some reluctance
on the part of tax counsel to concede that they are right.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I do not think, Mr. Justice, there

has been much reluctance since Guggenheim v. Rasguin, which
is 30 years ago.
Q

Let me ask one thing which gives me some

perceptual difficulty.

It seems to me there are two sets of

willing sellers and willing buyers here.

There is, if you

will, the estate and .the fund; and there is, on the other side
of that coin, ths fund and the buyer in the market place,

hnd

one could say that the Government’s position is linking the
buyer in the one couple with the seller in the other, and
eliminating the fund.
MR. GRISWOLD:
here, of course.

Is this perceptually a difficulty?
Mr. Justice, there are difficulties

Nevertheless, to me the really controlling

factor in determining whether the regulation made by the
Treasury can be sustained or not—-after all, this Court does
not have to decide whether it is right.

This Court need only

14
decide that it was proper for the Treasury to make this
regulation»

And the fact is that very large numbers of these

shares are transferred every day between willing sellers and
willing buyers at the net asset price»
It is said in the Guggenheim case that although the
insurance policy had a lot of value above and beyond the
surrender value and it is proper to take that into account
in determining the value of the insurance policy, but the
same thing is equally applicable here»

Mutual fund shares are

widely sold on the representation,which has great substance,
that this is the only way that a small investor can get
diversification.
They are also sold on the representation, which may
or may not work out in experience but presumably has some
effect to it and at least for which people are willing to pay,
that through the mutual fund you can get expert management»
You can get for your relatively small investment the same kind
of supervision and watching and care and foresight that a very
large investor can have»
Q

Are there any other examples of the Treasury,

of the Revenue Service,

valuing an asset at an amount that the

owner of it can never realise under any conditions whatsoever?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Justice, Guggenheim v.

Rasquin and the—
Q

Under any conditions?

15
MR. GRISWOLD;
know.

Under any conditions?

Well, I do not

Just as much as here, because the share may be valued

at its net asset value on the decedent's death at $10,000,
let us say, although he can only realize $9200 by turning it
in.

But by the time he does turn it in, the market has gone

way up and he gets $11,000 for it.

There is no impossibility

of his obtaining the full amount of the value, which is
determined at the date of the decedent’s death.
Q
then, either?

You would never let him off for that amount
The load charge under that.

MR. GRISWOLD:
load charge onto that.

No, I do not think you would add any
If he later sold the shares for

$11,000, he would have a gain of $1,000 and of only $1,000,
although he had in fact realised $1,800 more than he could have
realized on the date of death.
Q
you?

But you do not do that in other contents, do

How about an ordinary share of stock?
MR. GRISWOLD;

If the item is sold on the market,

then you do not take into account either buying or selling
commissions.

On the other hand, if the item is sold at retail—

and let us take jewelry, I have already referred to an
automobile—if the item is sold at retail, it is customarily
and always has been valued at its retail price.
Q

Of course, you have not had your automobile

regulations sustained, either, have you?

16

MR. GRISWOLDt

No, Mr. Justice.

The automobile

regulation goes back a great many years, and Guggenheim v.
Rasquin goes back 31 years now.

But this regulation not

only is 12 years old, but. it was officially promulgated more
than a year before this decedent died and it is in our
contention a permissible approach by the Treasury to take
to this problem.

As this Court has twice said recently, in

Corre11 and Dingier:

’Alternatives are of course available;

improvements might be imagined, but we do not sit as a,
committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tar
laws.

Congress has delegated to the Commissioner, not to the

courts, the task of prescribing all needful rules.

In this

area of limitless factual variations, it is the province of
Congress and the Commissioner,not the courts, to make the
appropriate adjustment.

The role of the judiciary in cases

of this sort begins and ends with assuring that the
Commissioner9s regulations fall within his authority to
implement, the congressional mandate in some reasonable
manner."
Q

What was the case, Mr. Solicitor General,

Corre11?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Correll.

Correll is in 389 U.S. 299,

and this quotation appears and the citations appear on page 9
of our brief.
Q

I am a little bothered by the exchange between

you and Mr, Justice
of the case»

Blaekmun earlier in just my own analysis

If the Commissioner had defined the valuation

of mutual funds for across-the-board purposes, I would find
it much easier to accept than applying the definition just
to estate tax purposes and apparently leaving open the
question of what the taxpayer who is giving mutual funds to
a charity*—how that will be valued,
I know you said in answer to Mr. Justice
Blaekmun*s question it was your position it should be valued
the same way.

But what was the practice of the Treasury at

the time that it sought to assess this estate?
MR. GRISWOLDs
limited to estate tax.

Mr, Justice,, the regulation is not
It also applies expressly to the gift

tax and was issued on the same day in the same Treasury
decision with respect to the gift tax.
With respect to the income tax# I know of nothing
which makes clear any practice in this respect.

It is my

position and a position which I would advise the Treasury to
folloxtf# that they should treat the public offering price as
the value for gift tax purposes, for determining the amount
of the gift in a deduction under the income tax.
Q

Do you know whether they would do the same

thing with respect to an automobile which Is given to a
hospital?
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes, Mr. Justice.

If they gave a

18
brand new automobile, X would think they would be entitled to,
let us say, an ambulance»

1 think they would be entitled to

deduct the cost of that automobile as a gift to the hospital,
Q

Suppose it were a used car, would it be the

retail value?
MR. GRISWOLD:

If it were a used car, I think it

would be the price which they properly paid to a dealer in
used cars.

In other words, the retail price for a used car.
But let me take an instance which seems to me to be

very close.

Let us just take a gift of mutual fund shares.

Suppose a man gives his daughter $10,000 worth of mutual fund
shares as a Christmas gift.

He would suppose, I think, that

he has made a ten thousand dollar gift and that he should make
a corresponding report on a gift tax return.
precisely what the regulation prescribed.
of our brief.

And that is

This is on page 27

We have set out the gift tax return, likewise

applicable with respect to gifts made after October 10, 1963.
That seems clearly the right value for gift tax
purposes of mutual fund shares.

And yet there is no basis for

distinguishing the value for gift tax purposes and the value
for estate tax purposes.

If the bid price determines the value

for estate tax purposes, then it is hard to see why the: bid
price should not control the value under the gift tax.

On this

basis the father would have made a gift of $9200 and not
$10,000,

That is, his gift would be valued at the net asset

value after excluding the load and not at the offering price,
which was in fact the price at which the willing father
purchased the shares from

s.

willing seller»

And, to me, the

controlling concept here, at least in determining whether the
Treasury had a rational basis for its conclusion, is the
retail price.

The retail price of these shares is the public

offering price, not the net asset value.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, I suppose in the

settlement of a very large estate, running into many millions
of dollars, it is a common experience to sell large blocks of
stock, and there are seme .SEC regulations that .if they ware
selling one block in one company they cannot sell it without
some clearances, and additionally if it were a large block it
might depress the market.

So, the executors hire Goldman,

Sachs to sell it? and Goldman, Sachs charges them a fee of
$50,000 to liquidate a couple of million dollars worth of this
stock.

That is what, an expensive administration—■
MR. GRISWOLD;

Thcifc is an administration expanse

which is deductible,
Q

Only from the income of the estate?

MR. GRISWOLD;

Deductible in computing the net

estate for estate tax purposes, not the income of the estate—
Q

Yes, that is what I meant to say.

MR. GRISWOLD;
estate tax purposes.

—in computing the net estate for

Q
too many.

May I ask you one more question,- I have asked
Let us take into account an unlisted stock which

is traded over the market, with bid and ask prices on a given
day.

As I recall the regulations, 2 have not looked at them

recently, the estate is allowed to take the average between
the bid and the ask.
MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Is this inconsistent?

Why should it not take

the bid price?
MR. GRISWOLD;

I do not think so, Mr. Justice,

because 1 think that really highlights the very point I am
trying to make, the difference between a sale on the market
in which case neither selling nor buying commissions are
taken into account, whether they are paid or not.

And in the

case of an over-the-counter share, if it is sold on that day,
then that determines the market price.

If it did not sell

on that day, then you take the mean between the bid and the
ask, because that is the closest you can come, although if it
is sold on the day before or the day after, that is also
sometimes given some weight in determining the value.
On the other hand, if there is no*—
Q

But totally unavailable to the estate.

MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

What is totally unavailable?

This market of which you speak.

MR. GRISWOLD;

No, you talked about over-the-counter

21
securities.

I am talking about things which ara sold on a

market which would include over-the-counter securities«

They

are sold on a market.
Q

But the IDS sale—

MR. GRISWOLDz

The IDS sale is not on a market.

It

is at retail, and that to me is the whole key to this
problem.
Q
market.

Yes, but the executor cannot sell on that

Totally barred from that market.
MR. GRISWOLD;

A person who buys at retail

ordinarily cannot resell, because he is not a retailer; he
is a consumer.

If he wants to dispose of whatever he buys,

whether it is a fur coat or an automobile or something else,
he has to find somebody who will give him something which
will be less than the amount he paid for it.
Nevertheless, if the item is a thing which is
customarily sold at retail, I think that the value for astate
and gift tax purposes should be the retail price, that that
is in effect what this Court decided in Guggenheim v. Rasguin,
that that is the foundation for the regulation in this case,
that the regulation may not be inevitable, and I do not
contend that it is, is a rational regulation, and that it
should be sustained by this Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
General.

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

Mr, Gregg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP RALPH J. GREGG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GREGG:

Counsel for the Government has argued

on the premise that the sole issue to be decided here is
the validity of the regulation,,

A mere rebuttal of this

would be apt to insure to only leave the Court with a rather
narrow’ and somewhat blurred vision of what this case is all
about o
The real: issues are factual.

Were the shares owned

by Mrs. Bennett at the time of her death worth $124,000, that
being the amount she could have sold them for?

Or were they

worth $133,000, that being the amount the executor would have
had to pay a broker to purchase as many additional shares as
she already owned.

And, thirdly, was the $9,000 difference,

that being the amount going to the broker, an asset of
Mrs. Bennett’s estate?
It seems to me that the regulation must stand or
fall on the answers to those questions.

Then there is also

the constitutional question, if the Commissioner may, by
regulation, deprive taxpayers of due process of law by fixing
an arbitrary value that precludes the consideration of any
other relevant facts.
I hope in a matter of ten or twelve minutes to give
the Court the benefit, I hope, of a broader perspective of

23
the mutual fund issue.

It was in 1962 that I first became

involved in the mutual fund issue, first on behalf of a
town police officer, then then on behalf of the estate of
my high school home room teacher.
Other cases came along quickly because, beginning
in 8 6.1, 8 62 , revenue agents were raising the same issue in
every estate owning mutual fund shares.

We scon discovered

that it was useless to argue with revenue agents.

Even

though they privately agreed with us, they said their orders
had come from Washington.

There was no one to appeal to

inside the Treasury Department.
So, what we did was to pay and sue for refunds in
the district courts.

We did not have to try those cases

because, as the counsel for the Government agrees, the
Department of Justice agreed with us and instructed the IRS
to refund our money.
But this was all prior to October 11, 1963.

There

really was not much of an issue to be tried in those days.
There was no doubt then as there is no doubt today about the
value of the mutual fund share.

It is the amount the share­

holder can sell it for by asking the company for his money,
and the amount is guaranteed.
Q
the Cadillac?

What about the Solicitor General's analogy with
If you took the Cadillac back to the dealer,

he would not give you the full price for it very likely.

MR. GREGG:

No, sir, he would not.

As a matter of

fact, if you bought, a brand new Cadillac and did not even tak
it out of his showroom and called up another

Cadillac

dealer and asked him how much he would give it to you, you
would still get a secondhand car price.
Q

Then you would say that in your estate, yon

ought to have the lower price?
MR. GREGG:
Q

Yes, sir, by all means.

Because there is no way you can realise

anything else—
MR. GREGG:
Q

No possible way.

How would the Cadillac be valued if it was on

order and the man died as he left the dealer's establishment?
MR. GREGG:

That would depend, sir, would it not,

on whether or not the retail dealer required the fellow to
take delivery.

In that case it would be a used car if he

begged off—
Q

Assuming he is going to stand on his contract

and file a claim against the estate if he does not—
MR. GREGG:

Yes.

Then he has a brand new car which

he has bought, taken titlae to, becomes a secondhand auto­
mobile.

If he calls up the~—
Q

At least the dealer might settle with the

ejiecufors by refunding or accepting just his load.
MR. GREGG:

Might very well.

But the dealer would

sell those.

I got my

I cannot give you all your money back."

If he were going to give him all his money back,
he would not have sued them in the first place,
And this test that I was talking about for mutual
fund shares, what they are worth, is exactly the same test
that they use for determining the value of a share of General
Motors, for example.

It is what the shareholder can sell it

for.
The amount revenue agents were talking about was
the amount that it would cost the executor to purchase as
many additional shares as the decedent already had, paying
a broker an eight percent commission for shares the decedent
did not hold.
Q

If I had a share of General Motors and it is

worth $100 on the market and I have to pay a commission, I
still realize maybe $93, $56, but I still have to include it
at a hundred?
MR. GREGG;
Q

No.

You say if you had to pay for it, sir?
If I own a share of General Motors and I

included it at $100, even though if I sold it and had to pay
a commission I might only net $96.
MR. GREGG:

I am sure that is true, because if I say

26

to my broker—
Q

There is no way 1 car. realize more than $96„

but it is includable in my estate at $100?
MR. GREGG:
Q

I agree with you a hundred percent.

That is like the Goldman, Sachs commission

that the Solicitor General and 1 were talking about, is it
not?
MR. GREGG:
Q

The what one?

The four percent.

The commission is an expense

of administration.
MR. GREGGs

No, it is not under the cases, only if

it is necessary, only if—if you pay on the higher price,
if you pay the estate tax on the higher price, you have a
higher basis, if it is then sold by the executor and it is
necessary to effect administration and everything of that
character, the Treasury says you may deduct that as an
administration expense.

But you will find that in all the

cases they are bitterly opposing the deduction on the grounds
that it was not necessary to effect administration or to
effect distribution or to pay expenses.
It is a capital loss, and I do not see how the
Government says you can take it as an administration expense
in an estate.
Q

And if you sell merely to protect yourself

against an anticipated drop in the market, do you get the

27
administrative expense deduction?
MR. GREGG:

Not at all.

-Not necessary for the

administration or to effect distribution.
Just as you say, if you tell your broker to sell
your share of General Motors and another fellow says to buy
one, and the sale takes place at a hundred, that is the price
at which the share changed hands between a willing buyer and
a willing seller under the regulations.

One fellow gets only

ninety-eight and the other pays a hundred and two.

But the

commissions paid are immaterial on the question of value, and
the Commissioner agrees.

But you see here he wants to add

the purchasing commission.
Q

What do you have to say, however, at the

Solicitor General's statement, factual statement, that there
are many thousands of buyers on the date of death who are
willing to pay net asset value, plus the load?
MR. GREGG:
industry.

That is the life blood of the whole

During the past year, for example, the number of

sales at the redemption price for many months exceeded
purchases at the pt^blic offering price.
and there are sales in both markets.

This is continuous,

But the only market to

which Mrs. Bennett had access, or her executor, was the bid
price market, the amount she could sell it for.
Q

Bearing in mind two sets of buyers and sellers.

MR. GREGG:

Yes, yes, Mr. Justice.

28

I think I have outlined it quite well in my brief
that the only difference really between the prices at which
mutual fund shares sell and those of listed corporations are
the way they are reported in the paper»

One is reported with

a purchasing commission; the others are reported without any
reference to purchasing commission.

And that is why, with the

only difference between the two, that is why this regulation
aroused such bitter opposition among the taxpayers, their
lawyers, and accountants.

Because it seemed to them that the

Government was merely slipping over on them the use of the
wrong price as quoted in the financial pages of the paper.
There is no doubt in my mind that the Commissioner
was going to lose this argument if the question is, What is
the value of a mutual fund share?

And I daresay that this

case would not be before this Court today except for one thing.
The Commissioner has a very powerful weapon to use in such
situations.

It is a regulation.

A regulation gives the Commissioner an overwhelming
advantage.

First of all, he has the choice of weapons.

He

can use the case he wants to try and the court to try it in.
The taxpayer has none of these choices.
Value becomes a secondary issue.

The taxpayer now’

has the burden of proving that the Commissioner’s regulation
is completely unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.
to top it off, the Commissioner has the presumption, the

And,

29

judicial presumption, that he is right and the taxpayer is
wrong.
This is not an isolated instance in which the
Commissioner has used his regulation in order to put the
taxpayer to disadvantage.

He did it with his second class of

stock regulations for professional corporations, his Kintner
regulations for professional corporations,

his business

expense regulations under Section 274, just to mention a few
that have been struck down recently by the lower courts.
he is even now doing it with

And

his Section 42 regulations on
*

multiple corporations where again the taxpayer is going to
have the very difficult burden of proving that a purely
arbitrary reallocation of income or expense is so arbitrary
as to be completely unreasonable.

on a hundred percent of what those shares can be sold for,
regardless of commissions.
Here the Government has ruled that a small investor
in a mutual fund must pay a tax on 108 percent of the amount
for which they could be sold.
Q

This, I say, .is wrong.

In the General Motors case, at least you get

the $100 in your pocket and you might have some expense? but
in this case you say it is impossible for you to ever realise
under any conditions more than the net asset valtxe?

MR. GREGG:

I must have misspoken, Your Honor.

Whether you dispose of the stock or not or put it in trust
is the question, What are they worth date of death* the
five million of common stocks.

They are valued at a hundred

percent of what they could be sold for on the market, with
commissions cutting no ice either way.
But here the Government is saying that this small
investor in mutual funds must pay a tax on 10S percent of
what they can realize.

That is with a small or a large investor.

MR. GREGG;

That is the two percent I was talking

about.
Q

And if you buy a hundred shares of General

Motors, you also pay a commission.
MR. GREGG:
Q

Yo^ also pay a two percent commission.

But in the case of mutual funds the commission

is paid only at the time of purchase.
MR. GREGG:
Q

Correct.

I think there has been some confusion

as to

33
that.
MR. GREGG:

1 see.

When a regulation has been issued, the taxpayer job
is not very easy.

He asked the Court to explore the facts

and decide the case on its merits.

The Government’s position,

however, is that the only issue to be decided in a vacuum is
the validity of the regulation.
And he reminds the Court that if there is at least
some plausible grounds or rational basis for the Commissioner*
decision, it must be sustained.

Here the Government has

offered in its brief and verbally an assortment of gift tax
cases as lending that plausibility, Guggenheim, the gift tax
cases, et cetera.
What connection is there really between gifts of
single premium life insurance policies on the life of another,
gifts of diamond rings subject to luxury wartime excise
taxes?
I think that these arguments have to be recognized
for what they really are, a diversionary tactic to persuade
the Court that the Commissioner was not totally unreasonable.
Then having gotten all of the plausibility mileage
out of these and other equally far-fetched analogies like
Blfickacre, et cetera, I think then the Government put great
emphasis, I think, on the duty of the Court to defer to the
judgment of the Commissioner in choosing between so-called

34
reasonable alternatives, citing the United States v. Coryell
and B1ng1er v» Johnson.

But again what do those cases have

to do with mutual fund shares?
In a ns , the question was,. When is a businessman out
of town?

In the other f What fellowships and scholarships are

exempt from income tax?

In both there were any number of

definitions, some good, some better, one perhaps the best*
And understandably the Court was reluctant to superimpose
its judgment on that of the taxpayer in those cases.
this is not a good, better, or best situation.

But

It is a good

or bad, is or is not, reasonable or unreasonable situation.
If Mrs. Bennett's shares were $124,000, they could
not have possibly been worth $133,000.

If the nine thousand

dollar difference was payable—if a broker would get fchat~-.it
certainly was not an asset of her estate.
And then as I pointed out before, with some
exceptions, mutual funds are held by people of moderate means,
the middle class investor, the rich man with a portfolio, as
I said, of a million dollars worth of securities and common
stocks listed on the exchanges.

He pays an estate tax based

on the net asset value of his portfolio.

But the Government

has ruled here that the small investor must pay a tax on 108
percent of the net asset value of his portfolio.
!

I do not see how the Commissioner justifies this
discrimination, and 1 would surmise that that is why the

35
Government did not ask Congress for a blessing on this
new regulation»

He might have been reminded, that Congress,

in passing the Investment Company Act of 1940 was recognizing
an important public need for a well regulated investment
medium for the small investor.

And he might have been told

that, it was not proper to penalise him for investing in the
open-end investment company shares that were provided by that
legislation.
Incidentally, counsel for the Investment Company
Institute as ©rnicus, has given the Court a very authoritative,
intelligent, informative brief as amicus, explaining
closed-end and open-end investment companies, load funds,
no-load funds, how the estate tax regulation ignores the
realities of the marketplace, and in addition rather sense­
lessly discriminates.against the holders of the load-fund
shareholders.
Our position is that the Commissioner in promul­
gating this regulation was completely unrealistic and
arbitrary and unfair.

By arbitrarily assigning a value here

to these shares, which the estate could never get under any
circumstances, and at a price that precludes consideration of
any other relevant facts, which is required by his own
regulations, we fchinlc that he deprives the taxpayer of due
process of law, and that is why on behalf of the many
thousands of executors and their attorneys for whom I happen

MR. GREGG:

I certainly am but not at—if they said,

"Yox* have got to value that General Motors share at a hundred
plus the two percent purchasing commission, in other words,
the replacement cost,” I would disagree with them and they
would be disagreeing with their own regulations, because for
time immemorial they have said the value of a General Motors
share is 100, not 102.

But they say that the value of a

mutual fund share is not 100, it is 108.
Q

Looking at it from the other side of that same
