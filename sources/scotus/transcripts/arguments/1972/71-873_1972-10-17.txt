MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. KAUPER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
Mr. Kauper:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal under the Expediting Act from an
order of the United States District Court of the District of
Rhode Island dismissing the Government's complaint of the
antitrust laws against the Falstaff Brewing Company.
The complaint alleges that the 1965 acquisition by
Falstaff Brewing Corporation, the nation's fourth largest
brewer, of the assets of the Narragansett Brewing Company, the
largest brewer in New England, violates Section 7 of the
Clayton Act,as amended.
Like, really, the preceding case on the Docket, it
is a potential competition case.
Central to the case is the need to halt and, if
possible, to reverse the increasing trend

toward concentration

in the brewing industry and local markets, a trend which was
both noted with concern and was the primary basis for this
«

Court's 1966 holding in United States v. Pabst Brewing Company.
The market in this case is not in dispute.

It is

4
stipulated it is the production and sale of beer in the Nets
England area, comprised of the six New England States.
There is no allegation in the case that at the time
of the acquisition there was any direct competition between
Falstaff and Narragansett.

The Government alleged rather

that Falstaff was a significant potential competitor in this
market, that the market was concentrated and becoming in­
creasingly so, and that the net effect of its elimination as
a potential competitor, therefore, substantially lessened
competition within the meaning of Section 7.
More particularly, the Government alleged that
Falstaff had the incentive to enter, it had the financial
capability to enter, it had reasonable prospects for successful
de novo or toehold entry.
The District Court,relying on two findings, dismissed
the Government’s complaint.

More specifically, the Court con­

cluded that Falstaff's management had considered acquisition by
other means, found them unprofitable, and that, therefore, the
decision was made by Falstaff not to enter this market by any
means other than the acquisition of Narragansett.
Q

The complaint did not allege, did it, Falstaff

was the only brewery with equivalent opportunity and resources
to enter this market?
MR. ICAUPER:

No, Mr. Justice, I think the Government

theory is it was one of the most likely entrants.

More

5

specifically, if I might, the allegation in the evidence sub­
mitted would tend to indicate that it is one of the nation’s
ten largest brewers. Seven of those brewers are already in the
New England market -Q

And two of them are 'way out Nest somewhere?

MR. KAUPER:

Well, I don’t know if I would say they

are 'way out West, but they are significantly further West than
Falstaff.

They are also significantly smaller than Falstaff.
Q

At least in arguments you are going to say that

Falstaff had superior opportunity and resources to any other
brewery not already in the New England market, to enter?
MR. KAUPER:

I believe that was the case.

I don’t

think we would have to establish that it was absolutely the
only one that could do so.
Q

On the other hand, if the record showed that

there were fifteen or twenty with equal access and resources
the potential competition argument would be much less strong.
MR. KAUPER:

Yes, 1 think if the evidence were to

demonstrate that there were a very large number of potential
entrants then clearly one would have to take the position the
elimination of one had no particular impact.
Q

In other words, part of the potential com­

petition theory, I should suppose, would be proof that the
potential entrant was, if not unique, at least one of a very
small group, would it not be?

6
MR. KAUPER:

I think that essentiaLiy is correct, yes.

So that its elimination had some consequence, otherwise, clearly
it would not.
The Court below, we believe, misconceived the
standards which are to be applied in this sort of a case.
More particularly in its two key holdings we believe that it
improperly relied upon subjective statements made after the
fact as to what the intentions of Falstaff's management would
have been at a previous point in time.

Second, we believe that

it failed to recognise the concentrated nature of the market
in the New England area, in finding that this particular
market was "intensively competitive."

Finally, we believe it

put undue weight upon certain post-acquisition evidence which
tended to indicate that following the acquisition by Falstaff
Narragansett’s market share declined.
Let me now briefly deal with the facts.

The Nevj

England beer market, first of all, is a growing market.

Total

sales increased by 9.5% during the period from 1960 to 1964.
In 1960, the top eight firms in the market controlled 74% of
the sales.

By 1964, that figure was 81%.

four firms controlled 50% of the market.
in 1965, 61.3% of the market.

In 1960, the top
The top four firms

In the seven years preceding the

acquisition, the number of brewers operating plants in New
England dec Lined from eleven to six.
In short, we believe that this evidence carefully

7
tracks the same trends which were noted by this Court in
United States v. Pabst Brewing Company in 1966.
The increasing trend towards concentration and decline
in number of brewers is approximately the same.
We also, as I indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart -the facts indicate that there are ten — of the ten largest
brewers of the nation, seven are already marketing in the New
England area.

The remaining three --of the remaining three,

Falstaff is clearly the largest.

It is also the one most

geographically proximate to the New England market although I
think we would all recognize it is not within, let's suppose,
100 miles.
The market is characterized, as is the marketing of
most beer by heavy promotional and advertising expenditure.
The Narragansett Brewing Company acquired by Falstaff
at the time of acquisition was the leading brewer in terms of
sales in the New England area, approximately 20% of the market.
It was at the time of the acquisition a healthy firm.

Its

profits and sales had increased substantially during the four
years prior to the acquisition.

It had engaged in significant

planned expansion and indeed acquired certain assets from certain
•

other brewers during that same period.

Its distribution system

was primarily through independent wholesale distributors.

They

were not bound by contract to Narragansett to handle Narragansett
beer exclusively, and, indeed, the evidence suggests that in

I

most instances they did not.
The Falstaff Brewing Company, the acquiring corpora­
tion, at the time of the acquisition, was the fourth largest
brewer in the United States, having 5.9% of the market.
at that time operated eight breweries.

It

Most of those breweries

had been acquired by Falstaff during a twenty-year period.
In most instances they were small, failing breweries of
capacities of some hundred, two hundred barrels.

In each

instance, Falstaff had substantially modernized those plants,
had greatly expanded their capacity, and in that manner had
developed the system which made them, by 1965, the fourth
largest brewer in the nation.
During the period immediately preceding the acquisi­
tion, Falstaff sales and profits had also expanded greatly.
It was a financially healthy company.

It had no difficulty in

securing capital.
Falstaff distributed its beer in two ways.

Approxi­

mately 80% of its beer in various markets was distributed
through independent wholesale distributors.
distributors were non-exclusive distributors.

Most of those
I think the

figure is something like 75% of the total wholesale distributors
did not carry Falstaff's line exclusively*
The balance of its beer was distributed through its
own owned branch operations.
it operated breweries.

That was true in cities where

It was also true in a number of cities

9
in California.

So that it was experienced with at least two

types of distribution systems, namely, the independent whole­
sale distributor as well as the branch distributor which it
owns.
So far as entry is concerned, Falstaff had perceived
that national brewers -- and you had Mr. Metzger in the previous
case refer to probably the four best known of the national
brewers — by virtue of their national status had certain
competitive advantages over Falstaff.

These include the

ability to advertise on a national basis, and what is referred
to as the so-called prestige factor.

The fact that an individua

who goes in to buy a bottle or a can of beer gets accustomed
to a particular brand which he can find anywhere in the United
States.
In 1958, Falstaff commisstoned a report to be made
to it on its future growth.

That report is referred to through­

out the record as the "Arthur D. Little Report," which was
submitted to Falstaff in 1960.

That report was designed to

indicate method of growth for the Falstaff Brewing Company in
the years to come.

It made a number of recommendations, but

let me refer to three.
First, it rather coldly and categorically stated that
if Falstaff was to expand its sales it would need to become a
national brewer with national brewer’s status.
Second, it recommended that entry be made into new

10
markets by the building of new breweries.

Specifically, in the

context of our case it suggested that Falstaff should enter
into the New England market -“pardon me, the Northeastern
market — by the building of a new brewery which was to be
located in Baltimore, Maryland.
But more generally, it concluded that building of

a

new brewery was more economical than entry by other means.

It also indicated that distribution by Falstaff through its
own company-owned outlets was more profitable to Falstaff
than distribution through the use of independent distributors.
Following receipt of that report, Falstaff began,
through public pronouncement and otherwise, to indicate its
desire to become a national brewer.
Foremost among its desires was an entry into the
Northeastern market.

In pursuing that particular goal, it

had negotiations with several other bewers before culmination of
the acquisition of Narragansett.

These brewers,

I think it

must be indicated, at least in several instances, came to
Narragansett — came to Falstaff — not the other way around.
But there were extended negotiations with the Leibman Brewing
Company.

There were extended negotiations with Rheingold

Brewers.

These are both brewers operating primarily —

having headquarters in New York City area but marketing in
the New England area.
Employees were sent to visit the plants of the Pie Is

Brewer, plants both in New York and Massachusetts.
There were contacts made with other brewers in the
Upstate New York area and3 indeeds contacts, inquiries made of
Falstaff by several smaller brewers — at least two, pardon me
— in New England area.
Now it is in that setting that the Government contend
that the acquisition of Narragansett by Falstaff eliminated a
significant potential competitor from this market.
Falstaff does not, as we understand it, deny that it
had the capability, financial, technical capability, to enter
the New England market.

Nor does it deny,at least in general,

that it had a strong incentive to enter the Northeastern
market.

It does not assert, as far as we can tell, that there

were any other brewers who were more likely to enter into the
New England market.
Its essential argument, as we understand it, is that
it could not enter this market other than by its acquisition
of the Narragansett Brewing Company because — and this was the
basis of the finding of the District Court — of statements
made by its executives that it was necessary to secure a strong
viable distribution system to enter the Northeastern market and
that kind of system could be obtained only through the acquisi­
tion of Narragansett.
ifence, I think the issue in large part comes down to
the criteria by which one identifies a potential competitor in

12
a given market.

That is,in a sense, issue one.

Second of all, I think it should be pointed out that
Falstaff also contends that this market was in fact intensely
competitive.

Now, I take it, that the relevance of that is

that if the market was intensely competitive before the
acquisition, intensely competitive after the acquisition, the
elimination of the significant potential competitor in and of
itself would not materially alter the competition in the market­
place, and hence, under those circumstances, we should net be
concerned about the question whether Falstaff is such a sig~
nificant potential competitor.
Now, in general, I don't think after the discussion
yesterday we need to review in detail the theory of a potential
competition case.

In essense, it has two parts.

One is that the particular firm — the acquiring firm
in this instance — was, in fact, likely to enter the market,
and that this because of the concentrated nature of the market
would be pro-competitor; that is, it is in fact a likely entrant.
Second part of the theory says, in essence, that its
presence as a potential competitor is likely to have had an
impact on the behavior of firms already in the market, and it
is that impact which is then eliminated through its entry of
a brewer particularly of the size of this firm, Narragansett.
Indeed, in the cases decided by this Court dealing
with potential competition, there appears to have been more

13
emphasis on the latter than on the former.
Those cases, the El Paso case and Penn-01in case,
Proctor and Gamble, Ford Motor case, decided last term, all
emphasised the effect which that particular acquiring firm
had on the market even without actual entry, but instead by
virtue of its existence, in the phrase which has come to be
used is on the wings of the market.
As it was put in Penn-01in the existence of an
aggressive, well-equipped and well-financed corporation engaged
in the same or related lines of commerce waiting anxiously to
enter an oligopolous market would be a substantial incentive
to competition.
Mow Chat’s the basic theory.
Q

A quotation you just read spoke in terns of

waiting anxiously, and you earlier used the term ”likelihood.”
Don’t those both suggest that inquiry here is a basically
factual one?

You wouldn’t disagree with that?

MR. KAUPER:

Well, obviously, there is a factual

question, but it would be in any case of this sort.

But I

think the question is what is it that the facts have to show?
Our contention in this case is what the facts have to show is
that there was a substantial incentive to enter, that there
was capability to enter, that there were reasonable prospects
for entry and that to a reasonable and prudent management
there was such an opportunity to enter.

14
Q

Well5 certainly those facts, at least as I

would see them, wouldn’t necessarily add up to a concept of
anxiously waiting to enter.

There is a subjective element

noted by the phrase '’anxiously waiting,” as by the tern
"likelihood,” I think.
MR. KAUPER:

Well, I think the Court dealt to some

extent with that same question yesterday, the question of
what is subjective, what is objective.
of: are they anxious?

I think in the sense

That may not be the best term to use.

It is, I recognise, the term used by the Court, but what it
suggests is the firm which is positioned at a certain point in
the market and because of that position that firm when elim­
inated brings about an anti-competitive effect.
Wow I think so far as what is subjective and
what is objective, and that is indeed a major part of what
we are concerned with in this case.

Let me, if I might, turn

to that because there was some discussion of that yesterday.
I think the question which was put yesterday is
that simply a matter of retrying the facts in this case
cannot be put in quite those terms.

What we are talking about

here is trying to decide what it is the facts have to show.
It is not a question of: do the facts show that this firm
would or would not in fact have entered.

Instead, the

Government’s contention is that the Court should apply here
criteria which are objective and structural in nature,and

15
having applied those criteria, we believe the Government has
met its burden in this case.
Q

What is the ultimate factual inquiry?

MR. KAUPER:

In our judgment, the ultimate factual

inquiry — and let me put it in several parts because i think
there are several issues although in a sense we are really
only talking about one.
Obviously, number one; is it a concentrated market?
And that is not the point we are talking about now.
Number two is the question of how many entrants might
there be.

That is, is this a peculiar entrant or one of a

group of peculiarly likely entrants?
But so far as the question of entry itself, it is
our belief, and indeed we believe that the Court has already
so indicated, that the

standard

to be applied is whether or

not a reasonable management on the facts established would
have believed there was a basis for entry if this acquisition
had been prohibited?
Q

Even though the Trial Court finds the fact that

this particular management, however a reasonable management
might have operated, did not plan to enter?
MR. KAUPER:
that argument.

I think we would be prepared to make

Now in this case, Mr. Justice,

I

think we

would also contend that the particular fact on which that
finding was based really was not — and taking that particular

16
finding -- was not based on evidence that showed what that
management had in fact done in the year 1964-1965.

In other

words, I think there is a second part to the problem in this
case because the testimony which is relied upon by the presides
of Falstaff, in particular, is testimony given at a much later
date as to what he would have done or would not have done,
what others in the management of Falstaff would or would not
have done.
But the testimony being given at a later date has
some of the aspects, obviously, of a self-serving statement.
Q

You say then that the District Court should

have disbelieved it?
HR. KAUPER:
have disbelieved.

No, I don * t think I would say it should

I think the argument we are making is that

because of the nature of that evidence it should not be the
governing criterion at all.

How, what I am suggesting is that

I don’t think it ought to be an issue of credibility of that
statement in a case by case sort of basis, that the standard
should be drawn so that that statement is really not the
crucial issue.

I don’t know whether I have made that point,

but it seems to me that when you say is it a matter of should
it be believed or should it not be believed I think that the
ideal standard would be a situation in which you did not put
a man on the stand and say to him, "Hhat would you have done
three or four years ago?1’

17
Q

You would, in effect, remove the concept of

anxiously waiting or subjective — make it kind of a reasonable
man’s negligence?
MR, KAUPER:

Yes, although I think that’s not quite

the point I am dealing with here,
points.

I think there are two

One I would not approach this as a standard which is

based upon testimony given at a later fact.
Now, your question, which goes to anxiously waiting,
could also go to the use of subjective evidence which is
contemporaneous with the act.
But, as it seems to me, there are two parts to this
particular problem.

In this case, the Trial Court relied upon

statements of the management that they would not have entered
in any other manner other than the acquisition of Narragansett,
that is testimony taken at a later point in time.
Q

Mr. Attorney General, since your premise is
... ».*•*

that — for this case, is the likely, impact of Falstaff sitting
on the edge of the market.

That is an assumption about its

effect on competitors in the market.
MR. KAUPER:
Q

That's correct.

So why shouldn't the standard be how com­

petitors in the market would view a potential entrant -the likelihood of the potential entry?
MR. KAUPER:

Well, I take it — let me see if X

understand your question, Mr. Justice White.

I take it what

lb

you are suggesting is perhaps what we should do in these cases
is put the actual members of the industry —
Q

Your argument is that this has an impact on

competition and no fool who is competing in the market would
assume --or would even think -- that some company would enter,
why your case has to fail.
MR. KAUPER:

Yes.

X think the point is that the

question of impact, whether we call it on the wings or on the
edge or whatever words we use, on those already in the market
is a matter — and I think this is your point --of the
perceptions of those within an industry.

That is one reason

why we think a statement made after the fact as to what a
SLrnfs intention would have been is not the criteria to be
a pplied in such a case.

Obviously, that is not perceived by

those who are already members of the industry.
I think our position on your question would be: if
i

the facts in the record demonstrate that there was a basis for
entry which would have been acceptable to reasonable management,
that that justifies the belief that others would have per­
ceived the same thing.
Q

So, really, the basic element is not the

actual likelihood of entering, but the perceived likelihood
of entry by those already in the market?
MR. KAUPER:

Well, I think, Mr. Justice, there may

be a case where it is precisely the question of actual entry,

19
that iss there could conceivably be a case where a firm has
no impact on the wings, so to speak, but where in fact it can
be demonstrated that it would have entered.
Q

Yes, and there could also be a case 180 degrees

the other way, could there not?
MR. ICAUPER:
Q

Yes, I believe there could be.

Where, in fact, there was no actual intent or

possibility for some reason that was secret, some family
reason or something, but if there were perceived potential,
reasonably probably potential of entry that would be enough
to satisfy the test, wouldn't it?

Even though it were quite

an inaccurate and incorrect perception.
MR. KAUPER: I believe that's right.
I am nearing the end of my time, Mr. Chief Justice,
I think I will reserve the balance.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Kauper.

Mr. Goring.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. GORING, ESQ.,
<
Mr. Goring:

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pLease

the Court:
I have been interested in several of die colloquies
between counsel, not only in this case but in the preceding
case, in the Court.
One of my interests lies in the dealing of the

20
Government with the subject of subjective evidence.
At one point in the briefing of this case, the
suggestion seemed to me clearly was that on subjective evidence
the Government did not elect to go so far as to say that
subjective evidence should not be admitted, and indeed they
made no objection to the kind of evidence we are talking about
at the trial level.
nonetheless, admissible or not, the Court should not
take it into account to any degree.
Now, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggests, the Governments
attitude would be quite different if the subjective evidence
favored them.
Now, we had the same sort of problem in the Court
below,and this is somewhat diverting but it is enlightening,
I believe, with respect to post-acquisition evidence.
On page 195 of the Appendix, what trial counsel for
the Government says in substance is that in some cases —
this is a quote — in some cases post-acquisition evidence
showing anti-competitive effects after an acquisition is
relevant.

However, post-acquisition evidence to show what

would have been had this particular acquisition not taken
place.

In other words, if the evidence to be introduced was

such as to show that after the acquisition antl-competltive
effects had been felt in the marketplace, that would be
admissible.

21
Judge Day said it would seem to the Court common
j ustice would dictate if the evidence indicated the other way
ought to permit a defendant to introduce it.

And Mr. Ccdy

in reply demurred.
Mow,that is the same attitude the Government has
about subjective evidence.

And let me turn to the subjective

evidence and speak upon it.
While I think the decisions of the Court clearly
suggest — and I know of no contrary decision — that it does
not deem its function to retry cases and will not do it,
further examination into the question of whether the findings
below were clearly erroneous, the discussion has got to run
the gamut of significant evidence.
Mow, the evidence that we are talking about —
Q

Excuse me, did the trial judge consider that

there would be no likelihood of entry if he was convinced the
management actually had no intention of entering?

Is that

the standard he applied?
MR. GORING;

That is not the entire standard he

applied.
Q

Can you tell what the standard they did apply?

MR. GORING:

He referred to that as significant.

What he says about it broad is the credible evidence establishes
that it was not a potential entrant into said market by any
means or way other than by said acquisition.

22
Q

He just stated his conclusion?

MR. GORING:

That is correct.

He does not refer the

question of whether Fact A or Fact B leads him to that con­
clusion.
3

Really, on analysis, the question is a little

more subtle than that, as my brother White has suggested
though, isn't it?

Basically.

It is not actual probability

or possibility of entry but the perception of that by those
already in the market.

It is a little bit like the — in

Naval warfare the fleet-in-being theory.

Now the British

Fleet at Scapa Flow may, in fact, have all its ships unable
to sail, but until or unless the enemy knows that it is still
the fleet-in-being.
MR. GORING:

I think it is quite clear that both

facets have some significance, if they both exist.

That is

the likelihood of entry and the apprehension in the industry,
in the market.
Q

Is there any evidence that that apprehension

was taken into account by the District Judge in applying the
standard?
MR. GORING:

There was no evidence of any kind that

that apprehension existed, none whatever.
Q

But how about in his — in the legal standard

that he applied?
I guess you can't.

Can you tell what legal standard he applied?
He just stated his conclusion.

MR. GORING:

You can't from the record pinpoint it.

But what I am suggesting is that the things that I am talking
about are in the record and some of the things which we have
just talked about a moment or two ago are not.

In other words,

there was no evidence offered by the Government that the
industry in the New England market had any apprehension that
Falstaff would enter the market, and there was therefore no
threat by virtue of their being 400-odd miles away, which the
Government suggested, in the wings.
Q

I take it; the Government's argument is, however
***•> t* t.y*. :

if you show some facts about an industry in a market area and
if it happens to be a very attractive place to do business,
it is profitable, that almost anyone in the industry would
think that an outsider with financial resources would be

interested in entering, in order

to share in the prosperity.

Take a set of facts like that, there must be facts about the
condition of the market in this record.
MR. GORING:

There are no facts about the profita­

bility of any entry which could have been made by Falstaff.
Now,the Government started this case in 1965.
took a large quantity of depositions.

It

It sought answers to

a large quantity of interrogatories. It served upon Falstaff
before the acquisition, before the consummation of the
acquisition, CID's seeking extensive information.
After the commencement of the suit, It took extensive

24

depositions.
Now, had it chosen to try and show the state of mind
of the industry in New Erg land with respect to- the threat of
entry by Falstaff, there would be a large quantity of witnesses
who could have been interrogated on this point, other members
of the industry; and I suggest some evidence of that hind is
essential.

I see no way, no reasonable way, of suggesting

that in industry one competitor does not know something about
what another possible competitor is doing and thinking.
Now, the reason behind — I am having to mix these
things up in part — but the reason behind the determination
of Falstaff management not to enter New England market
either independently or by what is referred to as a total
entry — whatever that means — blame the fact that they had
attempted to enter the Detroit market; they had attempted to
penetrate the Chicago market; they, being in Northern
California, attempted to penetrate the Southern California
market.

And in each case those attempts were dismal failures.

And they were dismal failures, so Mr. Griesedieck did testify,
because of the fact that there was not in fact when they went
into these areas a healthy distributor organisation,and in
at least one of them, their attempts to create one after
entering the market were failures.
And their conclusions were that they would make no
attempt to enter the market thereafter.

This occurred before

1964“1965.

They would make no attempts to penetrate a market

unless they knew they had a distributor organization which
was energetic, healthy, and which promised to be able to sell
the product which they were producing.
Q

Mr. Goring, on your suggestion that someone

called the other New England brewers, or some of them, would
you regard them as an entirely objective, impartial observers
of this scene?
MR. GORING:

To be perfectly frank, I should think,

they might be very willing to say to the Government exactly
what the Government wanted to hear, that they were afraid of
this chap standing in the wings.

They were apprehensive.

It did have something to do with their price structure.
Q

interest

In other words, it is a built-in conflict of

with respect to most of these people, is it not?
MR. GORING:

I am not convinced that when the

testimony to be educed that way runs in favor of the Government
the Government has much concern with their observations, but
I do believe that they could have obtained the soundest
evidence about what the thinking in the New England beer
industry was with respect to the likelihood and danger of
entry and the threat of entry.
Q

Well* if you are suggesting that they aren't

necessarily reliable witnesses on this.
aren't necessarily.

They might be, but

26
MR. GORING:

They could be honest, but let me give

you a sample of what is in the record in this case.
It was offered by the Appellee.

No testimony on

this point was offered by the Appellant.
Mr. Haffenreffer, who was then Vice-President in
charge of sales for Narragansett for a number of years before
the acquisition, was called by the Appellee and he was asked,
on page 376, "What have you to say about the presence of
Falstaff in Ohio on the West and in Washington and/or Richmond,
Virginia, on the South?

What have you to say about the com-

petive effect of their presence there and no closer to New
England?"
Answer:

"They were no threat.

consider them any threat to us.

We certainly didn’t

Certainly at that distance

they were no threat because of transporation costs."
Now, there was a x^itness who at that time had no
a:ce to grind, nothing at stake.

He had been a substantial

stockholder in Narragansett,and when this acquisition was
consummated stockholders at Narragansett walked off with
$19% million, scott free.
The District Court refused to enjoin the acquisition
before it was consummated, and dismissed Narragansett out of
the case thereafter.

•

•'

So at the time Mr. Haffenreffer testified, in 1970,
there x*as no possible conflict of interest.

He had no axe to

27

/

grind.

He had no concern with outcome o£ litigation.
That is the only piece of evidence in this

record concerning the thinking of people in the industry in
1965 a^out the danger to their position of a possiule entry
oy Falstaff.

They are eliminated as a potential competitor

in that aspect of saying, by that piece of testimony.
And the trial judge who, of course, is entitled to
accept it as true or reject it as false, and he accepted it
as true.
With respect to subjective evidence if it is
admissible, either it is initially at least up to the
prior fact to determine its truth or falsity.

If he finds it

true, I suggest he is entitled to find upon the basis of its
truth and come to a judgment of the case upon that basis.
And, unless the Court has changed its mind on the
view that it had in Yellow Cab and Oregon Medical Society,
it will be necessary to find that the Court below was clearly
in error, and to be convinced that a serious mistake had been
made by the Court below.
What the Government is seeking here for all the
words they use with respect to incentive of Falstaff to enter
this market — what the Government is really seeking is what
it sought in Pevm-Olin, which is the equivalent of an irrebut­
table presumption from two things, apparent financial ability
and a desire.

But desire does not reach the heights of

2a
incentive.
Incentive must have with it in the context of things
like this a reasonable anticipation of profit.

And there is

no showing in this record by the Government of any reasonable
anticipation of profit.
But they use the word incentive almost as though it
were the equal of desire.
With respect to the question asked by Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, trial counsel for the Government in his opening
said that he would show that for a number of years Falstaff
had had a gnawing desire to enter the New England market.
Falstaff had had a desire to enter the New England
market for a period of years and had never made any attempt
to conceal it.

But the question of whether it could profitably

do it either by independent entry or by the toehold theory
which nobody yet can completely define, the chances of profit
in entry in either of those directions was not perceptible to
Falstaff, and they had decided sometime before not to build
a brewery in New England,for example, a question which I put
to Mr. Griesedieck on page 296 of the record, after he had
told me it was his view and the unanimous view o£ the Executive
Committee that it would make no attempt to enter independently.
My question is:"^ pinpoint this to a degree had
you ever entertained the idea in the period of time from
approximately 1950 on, let's say, of building a brewery in

29
Haw England?
The answer was, "Mo, sir."
I asked him, ,%Jhy not?" and he told me that there
was no distributor system and no observable way to acquire one.
Now let'roe speak of the Arthur D. Little report
very briefly because that has — it has been suggested that
has some significance with respect to the .likelihood of
entry by Falstaff independently or toehold.
The Arthur D. Little report was the result of a
study by engineers with respect to certain aspects of Falstaff51
future, what they should do, what markets they should enter,
how they should try to enter them.
No reliable witness was called in support of that
report. I objected to it on the ground that it could not stand
by itself for its conclusion.

It x-jas admitted.

There is

nothing in the record to show x»hether the people who made the
s tudy and composed the report and offered their conclusions
and opinions in the report itself had enough expertise to
qualify as a witness, and tke report is insignificant because
of that.
The report did recommend that Falstaff build a
brewery in the Baltimore area and Falstaff decided that that
part of the report was not valid enough to entertain.
The report did recommend attempts to penetrate the
Detroit and Chicago markets.

Those suggestions Falstaff

30
analyzed on its own basis and found they had some merit, tried
them out and, as I have told you, failed.
Now the critical part of this case is that there is
no evidence to support the burden which the Government had.
The Government certainly had to demonstrate on the one hand
that there was in fact likelihood of entry which involves
ability to finance, desired entry and a reasonable profitability
from penetrating the market.
The Government did show desire.
financial ability.

They showed apparent

They showed nothing about profitability.

And you cannot tell from the Government’s case whether an entry
in either of the methods which they suggest made any sense to
a prudent businessman.

And I think it is some slight con-

sequence to remember that this was a public company.
stock

was

The

widely held and there was some danger of concern,

objection and litigation on the part of stockholders if they
made many more blunders of the same kind that they had apparenti
made in both Detroit and Ghlcago.
'.[■here is evidence in the record which we produced
showing the lack of sense in entering the market in either
of the two means suggested by the Government.
we called as an expert.

Dr. Horowitz

He testified as not feasible, not

profitable enough,to build a brewery and certainly not feasible
without being able to sell the beer.
Mr. Haffenreffer testified that he did not believe

31
that it was possible for Falstaff to acquire a viable, energefci
reliable, distributor organization.

He did not believe it

was feasible.
There are no facts in the record which carry the
Government's burden to an appropriate conclusion.

There

are facts in the record which clearly justify the trial
judge in any judgment for the Appellee if in fact he found
the evidence credible and believed it.
Q

How long now has Narragansett been operated

as an independent division, subsidiary of Falstaff?
MR. GORING:

After the acquisition?

Did you say

after the acquisition?
Q

Yes.

MR. GORING:

How Long was that going on?
Until the judgment was rendered.

I am not sure, as a matter of fact, that it has been changed
today, but certainly at the point in time when the judgment
was entered Narragansett was a wholly-owned subsidiary and
had been so since the acquisition.
Q

The acquisition was — ?

MR. GORING:

1965*

July 1965.

And that situation

was maintained at the request of the Government, of Falstaff
and by agreement of Falstaff with Government to do it that
way.

Whether that has changed in the meantime, I do not know.

I do not represent Falstaff in any other matter except the
matter which is before you.

32

Q

So at least until the judgment by the District

Court, Falstaff did not gain the advantage of marketing beer
in the New England market under its Falstaff name, under its
national brandname label.
MR. GORING:

Oh, yes, it made attempts to sell

Falstaff brand in New England,using the distributor organiza­
tion which existed in the Narragansett operation.
Q

And was the Narragansett label discontinued?

MR. GORING:

No.

No need..

There is a graph at the

end of Appellee's brief which shews what happened to barrel
sales of various brewers in the period from 1964 to 1968, and
it shows that Narragansett was being sold under its own brand
during that entire time.
Q

It does not show —

It doesn't show Falstaff, though.

MR. GORING:

No.

And the reason it doesn't was

because the quantity of beer sold by Falstaff didn't reach
the bottom line of the graph.

But the fact is that Falstaff

brand was being sold by Narragansett distributors and
Narragansett brand continued to be sold by Narragansett
distributors from the time of the acquisition to the present
time.
Q

I suppose one could assume that that was

regarded by Falstaff as a transitional step in what they
hoped ultimately would be the result.

Get the name exposed

to some extent before this was finalized.

33
MR. GORING:

The only information in the record

upon that, and I should have adverted to this, is the
testimony of Mr. Griesedieck under examination by me.
My question was* in substance, ’’Have you tried to
exploit and promote sale of Falstaff products in this period
of time?"
And his answer was that he had.
I can conceive‘of the Government and anybody else
suspecting that an acquisitor in a situation of this kind
might deliberately drag his feet.
My question was designed to get into the record
evidence that they did not do so.
Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Goring.

Mr. Kauper, you have four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. KAUPER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. KAUPER:

Let me address myself to several

matters raised in the argument of counsel.
He suggested there was no evidence of apprehension
within the New England market on the part of those in the
market of the likelihood of entry by Falstaff.
X think it should be indicated, number one, that
the testimony of Mr. Haffenreffer which he read to you, of
course says he did not fear them because of their transportatio

34
costs.
He are not talking about their entry through
transportation. But I think more important, there is an
impressive list of concerns marketing in New England who
contacted this particular brewing company with respect to
likelihood of acquisition. Not only the majors which are
referred to primarily in the brief, but several smaller
brewers contacted the Falstaff Brewing Company as a firm whom
they believed would be likely to enter.

The letters from

distributors which are contained in the record, some twenty
of them already existing beer distributors, simply allude to
the rumors of the likelihood that Falstaff was preparing to
enter this market.
Now, it is true there is no testimony by competitors
that their conduct was influenced by this individual firm
on the edge of the market.

It is quite clear, however, they

were perceived by those in the industry as a rather likely
entrant.
Q

Don't you think the Government hai some

duty to go forward with the evidence faster than testimony
on page 376 — this gentleman —
MR. KAUPER:

You are talking about the Chief

Executive Officer of Karragansett.
Well, I think, as Mr. Haffenreffer said, as I
understand it, is that during the time that lie was operating

35
Narragansett Brewery, he did not fear — maybe 1 read the
statement incorrectly — shipment into the area by Falstaff.
He puts it specifically in terms of transportation.
Now,it may be that at that point there was no
particular likelihood of that sort of conduct, but I think
given the objective fact here with respect to the likelihood
of entry, and the perception of Falstaff'8 entry by those
in the industry, and given the concentrated nature of this
market, that it is reasonable to conclude that their behavior
was affected by thisparticular firm.
Now, I think — and let me turn to that issue
because we really did not discuss it earlier.

The second

critical finding made by the judge,and there is some
difficulty here because the judge made no detailed findings
of fact, is that the market was intensely competitive.
Now, if that is so, presumably the elimination of
the significant potential competitor is of very little con­
sequence.

Nowhere, in his opinion, does he refer to the

fact that this was a concentrated market.

Nowhere does he

refer to the fact that that trend was Increasing.

He

accepts, primarily the testimony by Falstaff’s president,
the Chief Executive Officer of Narragansett, and the economic
expert put on the stand by Falstaff, that this was an in­
tensely competitive market.
And the statement by competitors giving the

36
concentration and the increasing trend towards concentration»
is precisely the kind of testimony given by bankers in the
Philadelphia Bank case which the Court said was lay evidence
not entitled to particular weight on this issue.
So far as the economist is concerned, he conceded
his primary argument was that prices had not risen in this
market commensurate with costs.

He conceded that he had not

examined price and cost data for the New England market.
Now, under those circumstances, the whole thrust
of this Court*s opinion in the past has been to look to
concentration as the indicator <£ competition in the marketplace.
I think that brings me to the conclusion,
Mr. Chief Justice.
Q
if I may.

Mr. Kauper, let me ask you one more question,
In your colloquoy with Mr. Justice White about

the competitors' perception of this potential competitor,
I take it ultimately that, too, is a subjective determination,
isn't it, albeit on the subjective state of mind of the
people in the market already.

They mu&t have perceived the

thing rather than it just being a question of a reasonable
person in their position being capable of perceiving it.
MR. EAUPER:

I think that is a subjective question,

I believe we showed, however, that perception by objective
fact.

37
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Kauper.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:46 o’clock, a.m., the case was
submitted.)
