CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next, in No. 71-6757, Fontaine against. United States.
Mr. Umin, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. UMIN ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. UMIN:

Mr. Chief Justice —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We are running, as you

know, a little over, and we will hope that you will move
right along with your argument.
MR. UMIN:

I will do my best, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case here on writ, of certiorari challenges the
validity of a guilty plea of Federal armed bankrobbery entered
by t.ha petitioner David X. Fontaine in Federal Court in
November of 1969.
The issues the case raises were each presented pro se
by Mr. Fontaine in his motion to vacate sentence under
U.S.C. 2255, and with the Court's permission, I would indulge
in some oversimplification initially and define those issues
as follows:
First, whether 2255 entitled the petitioner to an
evidentiary hearing

upon his concrete allegations which if

true would show that his guilty plea was coerced.
And, second, and even more important, I would

4
suggest, the threshold issue of whether petitioner's guilty
plea is void on the face of the existing record without further
evidentiary hearing for want of a valid Sixth Amendment waiver
of counsel.
The procedural history of this case is a history of
inattention to detail.

In the face of the petitioner’s concrete

allegations of police physical and mental abuse, the United
States attorney declined even to answer those specific
allegations.

The District Court nonetheless denied the

petitioner’s claims summarily without a hearing,

his waiver of

counsel point on trie ground that the petitioner had participated
in a Rule 11 proceeding, a guilty plea, and his voluntariness
claim on the same ground.
The Court of Appeals, typical of the inattention
paid to this case, affirmed the summary denial below in one
sentence, and that sentence contains an error, an error dealing
with the ground of decision by the District Court.
This Court granted certiorari and appointed counsel.
I mention the appointment only to highlight that, the absence
of counsel at all prior stages of this case, and most
particularly at the guilty plea itself is the critical fact at
hand.

From arrest, through custody, through plea and sentencing,

the absence of counsel raises a pivotal issue.

Whether this

record, the existing record made at the guilty plea discloses
a waiver of counsel compatible with the Sixth Amendment

5
standards, the issue must be framed precisely.

This is not a

question of whether at the guilty plea proceeding there was
an offer of counsel and a rejection of counsel.
about that.

We can argue

I do believe that the record shows something

resembling an offer and something resembling a rejection.

But.

the question is whether even if there was a meaningful offer of
counsel and a. rejection of counsel, the circumstances of that
offer and rejection disclose an understanding and intelligent
waiver under the Sixth Amendment.

To quote from Carnley v.

Cochran, in the absence of an understanding and intelligent
waiver, anything lass is not waiver.
Let me say one word, if I may, about the position
of thatissue in this case.

It stands as point No. IV in tne

petitioner's brief on page 47.

In my judgment, and I would

respectfully 3ubm.it to the Court, it's point number one in the
case.

So I am something in the position of a college debater

that I once heard who perhaps overtied to the structure of his
own argument had to begin by announcing to his audience,
have

four points to make.

"I

Let me make the fourth one first."

The waiver of counsel, indeed, is No. IV in the brief, but. it's
number one in the case.

Let me turn to the facts that surround

the waiver of counsel point, making two things clear at the
outset.
Absolutely nothing about that point, depends upon the
truth or falsity of the petitioner's allegations pertaining to

6
police abuse or coercion»

Likewise, absolutely nothing about,

the waiver of counsel claim depends upon the trial court’s
alleged compliance with Rule 11 at the guilty plea proceeding.
The waiver of counsel point depends entirely upon the record
made at that proceeding, for it. is .the record which must,
disclose whether there was not. merely an

offer and rejection

of counsel, but an understanding and intelligent, one.

It's

the record to which Johnson v. Zerbst, Carnley v. Cochran, and
Boykin v. Alabama

refer .

That record shows that the

petitioner was arrested on October 21, 1969, that with the
exception of hospitalization, he was in continuous custody.
It is undented on the record that, he was never arraigned, at
which time he might have been informed of his .right to counsel.
Even those facts are, strictly speaking, irrelevant.
The first fact which is critical is that during his
custody he signed two pieces of paper, alleged waivers of
grand jury indictment and counsel.

And on November 13, he

cams to court in the company of a United States attorney
without a lawyer and the plea proceeding took place.
I could read all of that proceeding to this Court
in approximately 4 minutes at a reasonable pace. Doubling the
time — let8s assume that, the proceeding took 3 minutes in
Federal Court.

There is, of course, no time requirement in a

guilty plea proceeding.

But I would submit that, it is some

index, the brevity of this proceeding is some index of the

7
care and attention that was paid to the proceeding as a whole
and to the question of the waiver of counsel.

And I would

read to you only that part of the proceeding that, deals with
the waiver of counsel, the very beginning of it.

I will be

very brief.
The United States attorney on page 3 of the appendix,
Mr. Chief Justice — the Assistant United States Attorney,
Mr. Zanglin begins:

"Your Honor, this is an arraignment on an

information charging the defendant with armed bank robbery.
He8s been given a copy of the Information.

He acknowledges that

he understands it and knows what the maximum penalty is.
"I have explained to him his right to an indictment by
a grand jury.

He ha3 waived that right and signed a waiver

of rights form.
“He understands that he has a right to an attorney
at this time and he informs me that he wants to waive that
right and has signed a waiver of that right. Knowing all of
these rights he informs me that he intends to plead guilty
to the information.
"THE COURT:

You are Mr. David Fontaine?

"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:
"THE COURT:

Yes, sir.

You have received a copy of the informa­

tion here, the charge here against you for armed bank robbery,
is that right?
"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:

Right.

8

"THE COURT z

The first thing of consequence is that,

you have signed also a waiver of grand jury indictment which
means you are entitled to have this matter first submitted to
a grand jury and a determination made by that body and an
indictment returned first,"
If the Court please, may I pause there to indicate
that the trial court in accepting the plea first emphasises
the waiver of grand jury indictment out of court and then to
the extent that it defines waiver at all, defines it exactly
erroneously.

A waiver of a grand jury indictment does not

mean that you are entitled to have this matter first submitted
to a grand jury.

It means exactly the opposite.

The court then continued:
and the rights you have thereunder?

"Do you understand that
Anyway, that's what you will

get if you wanted it to go to the grand jury."
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

ambiguity that troubles you

about the first part?
MR. UMIN:

I think not, your Honor, because all the

court does is ask the defendant do you understand that and the
rights you have thereunder?

If ha understood that, that

definition of waiver, he would be understanding precisely the
opposite of what waiver was.
"Anyway," the court says, “that's what you will get
if you wanted it to go to the grand jury.
"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:

Yes.

9
"THE COURT:

You

have signed a waiver of that, right.,

am I right?
"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:
There is

Yes, sir."

no indication by the court at that time

that the defendant was free at that point to reconsider his
is
waiver. The whole issue of waiver/introduced by the trial court
without any suggestion that, prior waivers made out. of court
and in custody can be reconsidered.
And then the court addresses the critical counsel
point.
"THE COURT:

In addition, you are entitled to be

represented by an attorney and, if you are without, funds with
which to employ an attorney, the Court will appoint one for
you.

The Court has here before it a waiver of assignment of

an attorney.

Is it your wish to proceed here without an

attorney?
"DEFENDANT FONTAINE: I gueS3 SO.
"THE COURT;

You have got to know so.

"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:

Yes, sir."

I would submit to this Court that that part of the
plea proceeding, which is all there is on the question of the
waiver of counsel, is deficient in multiple respects.
First, there is no explanation at all in that time
of the proceeding or anywhere else as to what a guilty plea
is, wiiat rights it waives, and what right exists to plead not

10
guilty.

Under Boykin v. Alabama, a Stata case but decided

under Federal constitutional standards, that, alone is sufficient
to condemn the plea and force vacation of this conviction.
But there is more.
The court gave no explanation that a guilty plea
does not entail the waiver of counsel.

Indeed the opposite

impression is left by the court's indication that, "You have
got. to know that you want to waive counsel.”

I don't suggest

that's the only implication to come out. of that sentence, but
it's a fairly likely one.

And a layman is all too likely to

consider a guilty plea as the equivalent of an abandonment of
the lawyer.
of trial.

The lawyer is useful for the fight, for the time
But if you are going to plead guilty, you certainly

don't need a lawyer.

And I suggest that in order to correct

that impression, to make sure that an understanding and
intelligent waiver of counsel takes place, it. is the obligation
of a court accepting a guilty plea to indicate when a waiv~r
of counsel is possible is tendered, that, a guilty plea does not
entail the waiver.

Nor, of course, is there any explanation

of the role of counsel at a guilty plea, of his critical role
in plea bargaining.

This aase does not. indicate that any plea

bargaining took place.

Indeed, the sentence of 20 years,

maximum 25, suggests that it didn't.

And there were also

lesser included offenses than Federal armed bank robbery which
were never mentioned by the court and which could be very vital

11
indeed in plea bargaining.

The absence of any mention of

lesser included offenses is in ray judgment sufficient to
condemn this plea under McCarthy v. United States where this
Court did not quite hold that lesser included offenses had to
be mentioned as part of the explanation to the defendant, of
the nature of the charge that was involved, but it strongly
suggests in footnote 20 that where lesser included offenses are
involved, a defendant cannot, understand the nature of the
charge without being told about it.
far condemn

Boykin and McCarthy thus

tha plaa, but there is still more.

There is no statement by thi3 court that the court
thinks that, counsel would be desirable, that a waiver of
counsel is ordinarily not preferred.

Indeed, as this Court

has put it on many, many occasions, every presumption is
indulged against waiver.

The system really has no interest in

an uncounseled guilty plea, although it has an interest in
guilty pleas generally.
Nor,

when the petitioner indicated that he

guessed

he did not v/ant to proceed with a lawyer, did the court take
any concern or pains to clarify that ambiguous rejection, to
indicate at that point that he was offering a lawyer for this
plea,to do anything at all to suggest to the defendant that
this is not the time to guess about whether you want a lawyer
or not.

If you have any doubt at all, the court, advises you

to have one.

12
QUESTION:

Isn’t there any intimation in the judge’s

comment, "You've got to know so,"
MR. UMIN:

It would probably be fair to say, Mr.

Justice Relinquish, that something would depend on how, what,
kind of tons of voice the trial judge said you’ve got to know
so.

If he said you have got to know so, that might mean

to a defendant, in order to plead guilty, you have got. to know
that you don’t want a lawyer, which indeed would be the common
sense interpretation that a layman might draw.
don’t need a lawyer to fight.
need a lawyer.

I’m giving up.

After all, I
So I don’t

Or alternatively, it might have meant, "I

don’t want you to guess."
QUESTION:

The whole proceeding statement of the

court was addressed to the availability of counsel and not to
the plea of guilty, as I read that proceeding, beginning, "In
addition, you are entitled to be represented by an attorney."
MR. UMIN:

That’s true, too, Mr. Justice.

But it

never made clear in that colloquy that, by "entitled to be
represented by an attorney," the court meant an attorney right
here now at. this guilty plea.

An implication from that is, if

you want to go forward with your plea, you have got to know
that you don’t want a lawyer.

If you want to go to trial, then

you may want a laitfyer.
I don’t suggest, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that that’s
the only interpretation of tills language.

I suggest when the

13
solemn occasion of a guilty plea is before the court, there
is no room for ambiguity.

I suggest that we hark back to the

language of Mr. Justice Black in Johnson v. Zerbst. when he
said that the tender of an uncounseled guilty plea presents
to the court an occasion for the protection of the court, present!
to the court an occasion at. which the court has to take the
greatest care that an uncounseled guilty plea is really the
intelligent desire of a petitioner.

And a court that would

let the kind of colloquy that 1 have read that is reflected
on this record go by with the kind of ambiguities in it, I
suggest to you is not the sort, of court that has taken the
kind of protection to see to it that the defendant understands
what it means to have a lawyer at a guilty plea and has then
made a voluntary rejection of it.
The Government’s answers to these arguments conss*
of four:

That the

...

offer and rejection is something

that the petitioner does not challenge, although one could
say that the offer wasn't all ‘that clear in this respect, that
the court was offering a lawyer for this guilty plea proceeding
and, indeed, that the rejection wasn't all that clear.

The

Government says that the ambiguity may have been,ambiguity in
the rejection, "I guess so," may have been cured by matters
of tons of voice at the pleading, and I don't doubt that
either.

But the question is not whether there was simply an

offer and an unequivocal rejection, although I suggest that

14
tills Court should require absolutely unequivocal waivers of
a lawyer,
QUESTION:

Are the matters on the bottom half of

page 5 and 6 irrelevant to the points you are making now?
ME. UMIN:

Yes, they are, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Detailed description of the crime?

MR. UMIN:

I would submit, your Honor, that the

description of the crime is entirely irrelevant to the question
of waiver of counsel, but I would also quarrel with your
suggestion that it was a detailed description of the crime.
QUESTION:
MR.UMIN:

You say it’s entirely irrelevant?
Yes.

The question of whether a man knows

whether or not to have a lawyer.
QUESTION:

Does it have any bearing on the question

ofhis own evaluation of his need for a lawyer?
MR. UMIN:

I think not, your Honor.

He may feel

that he held up a bank or participated in holding up a bank, but
he may not know, for example, that if you didn't have the gun,
you might be chargeable under 21-113(a) which is a lesser
included offense, something a lawyer could help him with, or
indeed, if you just leave the bank with someone else's money,
you would b© chargeable under 21-113(c) punishable by only
one year in prison.
QUESTION:
these things.

By his own statement, he has done all of

He had a gun and he took the money.

15
MR. UMIN:

H© never specifically says he had a gun.

And indeed he doesn't really give a narrative of any kind,
your Honor.

What he does is respond to the court's questions.

"What did you do on October 8th?"
"I held the bank up."
"THE COURT:

What?

"DEPENDANT FONTAINE:
"THE COURT:

You held up a teller?

"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:
"THE COURT:

I held up the teller.

Yes, sir.

Did you take from him some $1,400.00

plus?
"DEFENDANT FONTAINE:

Yes, sir."

Now, that is certainly an acknowledgement of soma
of the details of the crime.

There is no question about that.

Though it's the kind of acknowledgement., I might, add, that
you would expect from someone who was coerced, it's the
response to fill the abstract questions about a bankrrobbery.
QUESTION:

What * s abstract about the question:

"And by the use of a gun, pistol, right?"
And he answers:

"Right."

QUESTION:

....

repeated that by going from the

abstract if you want to describe it that way, to the concrete
and said/ "What did you do on October 8th?"
His answer was, "I held the bank up."
"What?"
"I held up the teller."
Is there anything ambiguous or

evasive or uncertain

about that?
MR. UMIN:

One of the things this plea proceeding

doss not include and which I believe is in response to your
question also, is that Federal crime requires it be a Federal
bank, and for that purpose, although it may have bean useful.
Perhaps I should recede to some extent from the
notion that the statement what you did on a given day is
totally ireelevant to your need for counsel.
QUESTION:

Do you now question whether it was or

was not a Federal bank?
MR. UMIN:

I don't question it, your Honor, but. I

have no idea whether it was or was not a Federal bank.

There

is nothing in this record that would suggest it is —
QUESTION:

A federally insured bank, not a Federal —

MR. UMIN:

Federally insured bank, right.

There

is nothing in the record suggesting one way or the other, no

17
mention by the trial court of that issue, which is of course
an element, of the offense and, since it. was not mentioned in
the plea, is yet another basis, if this Court needs one, to
condemn this case and plsa under McCarthy v. United States.
It's a rather technical basis, and I think a much more
important holding of this Court, if I can presume to suggest
one is that waivers of cmmsel obtained in District Courts
ought to be obtained with the greatest, care and the greatest
concern that a defendant understands what he is doing, that,
he is told about plea bargaining, that he is told what the
elements of defense are, that ha is told that a lawyer can be
very useful to him indeed at the time of the guilty plea, and
that the court is absolutely certain that the defendant
understands those things if he wishes to waive —
QUESTIOH:

I suppose your observations would also

relate to his response when he explained why he was tendering
a guilty plea on the next page, "Well, your Honor, I wish you
would accept my plea on the fact, that I have never had a past
record.

I got strung up on the drugs and I started to

make some money.11
MR. UMIllt

Indeed it would, your Honor.

That

language suggests that the defendant may have confused a
plea of guilty with a plea for mercy.

The state of his mind

isn't entirely clear at that point at all.

And i think that,

at that stage, it was an obligation of the court to investigate

18
the question of drugs and to find out, for example, whether
this defendant was mentally incompetent, as ha alleges, because
of drugs.

Instead the court with characteristic inattention

ignores the issue altogether.

If the defendant had a lawyer

at that point, he may indeed have been of some use both to
the defendant and to the court on that question.

and Federal police were grilling him.

QUESTION:

assumptions that, we can make.
MR, UMIN:

Just assumptions, pardon me?

QUESTIONS

There is nothing in the record that the

U.S. attorney discussed this case outside of the court, v7it.l1
the petitioner.
MR. UMIN;

Not as plea bargaining.

There is something

in the record suggesting that, the U.S« attorney had advised
him of certain rights.
QUESTION:

That3s what I meant.

MR. UMIN:

Even if that advice had been given,

however, this Court has never accepted non-adversary advise
as a representation of counsel within the meaning of the
Sixth Amendment, Andrews v. California being an instance of
that.
The petitioner has asked the Court to vacate the
guilty plea or to order that it be vacated by the District
Court as void then on a number of grounds.

First, on the

ground that there was no intelligent waiver of counsel, that
thi3 record does not disclose any intelligent waiver of
counsel, and that no remand is required for that purpose.
Camley and Boykin

standing for that proposition.

Second, that the nature of the guilty plea was
inadequately explained, and that Boykin alone condemns the
plea on that ground.
Thirdly, that for a technical and, if you will,

20
spiritual reasons, the Rule 11 was not complied with either
in a technical sense or in terms of its spirit in that the
trial court failed to spell out four of the elements of the
offense and failed to inform the petitioner as to lesser
included offenses.
On any one of those grounds, this Court should remand
to the District Court for a vacation of the plea without
further evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION;

Did you say the defendant was — after

ha was arrested, was he taken before a commissioner or —
MR. UMIN:

He alleges that, he was not, your Honor,

and the United States attorney never denied it.

To this date

no one has denied that he was never taken before a United
States Commissioner.
QUESTION:

But he was never left bound over?

MR. UMIN;

I don't know what happened.

The record

does not illume how he got from his home on October 21 to the
courtroom on November 13, save to say that he alleges continuous
custody, abuse of continuous custody, never got before a
magistrate, and did in fact appear in court on November 13,
aperiod of some 3 weeks.

Whether he was bound over by any —

certainly not by a grand jury.

We know that he waived

indictment.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. UMIN:

Ultimately, yes, an information substituted

21

for a grand jury.

W© know no grand jury bound him over, and

there has been no denial that no United Stats Commissioner
bound him over, or that he waived either grand jury indictment
or preliminary hearing.,

There is nothing in the record on

that point whatsoever.
QUESTION:

And the record does show that during part

of that period ha was in the hospital.
MR. UMIN:

Yes.

But no indication, that that hospitali.2

tion in any way broke the custody or the chain of coercion
which h© alleges.
It's to that chain of coercion that I would now turn
for the second point in the case, which was featured in the
petition for certiorari and may have been the reason for
this Court1s grant of it.

And that is petitioner's contention

that 2255 of Title 28 of the United States Code guarantees
him an Evidentiary Hearing on concrete allegations of coercion
which if true,

would show that his guilty plea was coerced,

unless the files and records of the case conclusively show
that he is not. entitled to such a hearing.
On tills wing of the argument, let me make clear if
I can what is not in dispute.

It is not in dispute here that

petitioner's allegation was sufficient to show coercion if true
Q

It is not in dispute that such allegations were traditionally
heard in Federal habeas corpus.

It is not in dispute that

2255 and its"conclusively" language was enacted against the

22
background of tbs habeas corpus cases and carries forward the
understanding of those cases.

The cases of

Waiey v. Johnston

and Walker v.-Johnston are conspicuously absent, from the
Government1s brief, and that is because they stand for tne
proposition later embodied in the conclusively language, the
trial court on a 2255 motion, save in cases of inherent
incredibility, has no credibility function to perform until
it holds an evidentiary hearing.
Likewise, it is not in dispute that subsequent to
the enactment of 2255 in Machibroda v. United States and
Sanders v. United States, this Court confirmed that save for
cases of inherent, incredibility, an evidentiary hearing must
be held upon allegations which are sufficient to grant relief.
Nor is it in dispute Kaufman v. United States this
Court applied the Townsend v. Sain criteria to the question
of when an evidentiary hearing should be held and indicated
that those criteria were fully applicable under 2255.
The Government's arguments instead to justify the
denial of a hearing in this case are twofold.

First, that by

participating in the guilty plea proceeding in alleged
conformity with Rule 11, and I submit Rule 11 was not
complied with, the petitioner in effect forfeited his right
to an evidentiary hearing.
characteristics.

That argument has two principal

It's an old one and Itf-s a bad one.

It’s

an old argument because it was an advance in substance in

23
Waley v. Johnston.
at

Waley, who was represented by counsel

a guilty plea later alleged that he had been coerced to

plead.

The Court, of Appeals held that his participation in

the plea proceedings with counsel in effect waived his right
later to attack that plea.

The Solicitor General at that

point confessed error, and this Court held that if the coercion
was sufficient to

taint the plea, surely it is sufficient

to negate any suggestion that at the plea proceeding the
petitioner waived his right later to attack it.
So the first or forfeiture argument is an old
argument that this Court has already rejected.
The second argument

is likewise a poor argument,

I would suggest for a couple reasons.

First, it ignores that

the petitioner in this case, although he did participate in
a Rule 11 proceeding at which time ha indicated that his plea
was voluntary, has alleged that in fact he vras coerced to plead.
And the argument of the Government ignores that the coercionalleged applies not only to the guilty plea itself, but to
the statements made thereafter, including the statement -that
the plea was voluntary.
The Government suggests that, in certain circumstances
it may be reasonable to suppose that a defendant would not
raise the issue of coercion at a plea, such as where he has
been told by the prosecutor not to reveal his promises to
the judge or his own lawyer, such as Machibroda.

But in the

ordinary casa when a defendant participates in a plea, he
should not later be allowed to attack the plea as involuntary
if he didn't object to voluntariness at the time of the plea.
First of all, this

petitioner does tender the

allegation that the plea's coercion extended not only to the
plea itself, but to the plea proceedings.

And so we have

suggested a special reason for not having mentioned voluntariness
in the courtroom.
Moreover, however, the Government's suggestion that
participation in plea proceedings breaks the chain of coercion,
in effect, and thus insures that a statement of voluntariness
at a plea proceeding is a valid one, which cannot, latar be
attacked, the Government's suggestion that the chain of
coercion has been broken by that kind of participation in a
plea proceeding assumes the very question that an evidentiary
hearing is designed to test, whether in fact, there was any
break in the

chain of alleged coercion if coercion did in

fact take place, whether the plea proceeding was effective
in enabling the defendant to come forward and say, "No, your
Honor, X was coerced, it's not voluntary."

And, indeed,

certain kinds of plea proceedings might be one which this
Court could trust when defendants made expressions of
voluntariness therein as being the kind of plea proceedings
which would later bar him from attacking the plea collaterally,
such as a plea proceeding in which the defendant is represented

25
by counsel or a plea proceeding in which the Rule 11 procedure
is not engaged in in the form of ritual, as it was here, but.
is a genuine inquiry by the trial court, into the nature of the
charge, the defendant's understanding of it, and his voluntary
participation in the plea proceeding,
QUESTION:

Do you remember, wars the District Judge

that heard, Judge Kaess who wrote the opinion in the habeas
corpus, was he the sentencing judge?
MR, UMIN:

Yes, ha

was, your Honor,

That's not a new circumstance in cases under 2255,
In Hachi.br oda, for example, the same judge who took Machibroda8 3
plea was the sentencing judge and this Court did not find that
sufficient to enable, for example, the charges, to say,

"Well,

I saw him at the plea, and I knew it was voluntary."
QUESTION:

Doesn't the statute require, if he is

available, to have th© same judge?
MR. UMIN:

No, your Honor, it does not.

QUESTION:

Maybe it's just the practice.

MR, UMIN:

I think it frequently is.

records of this case conclusively show in effect that the
petitioner was a liar.

of law in conjunction with it.

He also filed a brief

He was 26 years old at the

time and it might take someone 18 months to file the kind of

2b
brief he. did in fact. file.
The Government alleges that in exaggerating his
illnesses, his hospital appearances, the petitioner confused
one hospital record with another as if to say no evidentiary
hearing is necessary because the hospital records refute the
petitioner's claims.

The hospital records, I submit, to this

Court., should be investigated quite carefully.

None of them

were written at the time of the events they purport, to describe,
the first one three days after the petitioner left the
hospital, the second one three months after the petitioner

left, the hospital.

So that, for example, it is no indication

of the petitioner's incredibility whatsoever that his firsthospital record does not show, as he alleged, that he bled
from a gun wound.

It does show that he had a gun wound.

It

does not indicate that he arrived at the hospital bleeding.
But the record itself does not show that the person who wrote
it three days after, not after the petitioner arrived at the
hospital, but three days after he left the hospital, was even
the doctor who examined him first and therefore would have been
in a position to check a matter like whether his wound was
bleeding.
Thirdly, the Government suggests that the petitioner
admitted guilt at sentencing and indeed he did so, but he
alleges that not merely his plea of guilty, but his admissions
at the plea were coerced.

And finally the Government, says that, his allegations
he didn't understand the jargon at the plea proceedings is
absurd because the court used only simple terms like banks,
guns, etc.

The court also used some not simple terms, like

waiver, a terra that the Government fails to include in its
list of simple terms, and to the extent indeed that it explained
waiver, it explained it wrongfully.

And indeed the Government1s

argument on the jargon gets us back to what X do believe is
in fact the main issue in this case, that there was no valid
guilty plea under Boykin v. Alabama, that there was no valid
guilty plea under McCarthy v. United States, and that this
record does not disclose an understanding and intelligent
waiver of counsel as this Court's cases, Johnson v, Zerbst
to Carnley require.
Accordingly, this Court should remand to the District
Court with directions to vacate the guilty plea without further
evidentiary hearing, or in the alternative, for an evidentiary
hearing.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR.
the Court:

HUNTINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

28

Tha Government' s position is that, the files and records
in this case conclusively show within tha meaning of 28 U.S.C.
2255 that petitioner was competent at the time he pleaded
guilty to armed bank robbery, that his plea

was voluntary,

and that he validly waived counsel before entering the plea.
The District. Court was therefore warranted in denying
petitioner's collateral attack on his plea without a hearing.
Now, in contrast, to Hr. Umin, I would like to
discuss the voluntariness issue first and then come to the
waiver issue.

And I would like to point out what, we think are

the pertinent facts as far as the voluntariness issue is con­
cerned .
Petitioner alleged in his motion that, he was arrested
on October 21st, and the hospital discharge summary attached
to his motion shows that on the night, or at. least on the 21st,
ha was admitted to the hospital for a 5-day stay.

All of the

alleged acts of intimidation and coercion referred t.o in
petitioner's motion took place either immediately after his
arrest or during that initial period of hospitalization.
On November 13, or 18 days after his discharge from
the hospital, petitioner pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery
before Judge Kaess.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record indicating

whether he was taken before a commissioner?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

No, there is not.

I would suggest

Don’t the rules say you have to waive it in open court?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

MR. HUNTINGTON:

That was before his arraignment.

Well, the arraignment, the guilty

Well, normally a defendant would have

been taken before a commissioner where he would have been

of the charges against him and also advised of his

right to counsel at that time.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, I would suggest that it

appears from the record that ha was arrested by Detroit
police. And it may not have been until some time after he was
in custody — as a matter of fact, in his motion he alleges

30

that it was while he was at the hospital that, the bank robbery
charge came up.

So it could have been after ha was in custody

under State charges that the bank robbery cams to light, and
that therefore this was the first, judicial proceeding on the
bank robbery charge.
QUESTION;

The Federal charge.

MR. HUNTINGTON;

QUESTIONS

— through brutality and coercion.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

We suggest, it is our basic position

that where there is a substantial period of time between the
alleged acts of coercion and the guilty plea, that than unless
there are soma vary specific allegations of objective facts
as to why those acts of coercion taint, the plea, then in that
situation it's reasonable to expect the defendant to answer
truthfully to the court's questions at the guilty plea hearing
as to whether there were any threats or promises.
Now, I would like to address
and the hearing which was held here.

myself

to Rule 11

Now, Rule 11 requires

that the judge personally address the defendant on three
matters — on the voluntariness of the plea, on petitioner's
understanding of the nature of the charge, and on his understanding of the consequences of the plea.
that was complied with.

Now, we suggest

A look at the reading of the record

shows that that was complied with.
Rule 11 also requires that the judge satisfy him­
self that, there is a factual basis for the plea.

And we

suggest that that also was complied with here.
With respect to the point about whether the bank was
insured by the F.D.I.C., the judge had before him the information

33

And the information is not in the record.

It was attached

to the Government's brief in the Court of Appeals, and the
information does state the bank was insured by the F.D.I.C.
So we believe that Judge Kaess would have been perfectly
satisfied that the Federal element of the offense was present
here.
Now, we acknowledge that there ara situations, and
we spell them out in some detail in our brief, where a
defendant's answers at a guilty plea hearing that his plea
is voluntary should not be binding upon him.

Nov/, one obvious

situation would be where he later alleged that he was mentally
incompetent at the time of the plea.

And another situation

would be where a prosecutor expressly warns him not to
disclose the terras of a promise of leniency to the court.
There are a number of Court, of Appeals oases involving this
type of situation, and indeed, the Hachibroda case was this
type of situation.

In this type of situation the defendant

obviously cannot be expected to answer truthfully having been
advised by the prosecutor to answer falsely.
But apart from those situations, we suggest that the
defendant can be expected to answer these questions.
only connection that petitioner draws

in

The

his motion between

the acts of coercion and the guilty plea is the statement that
the police had conditioned his mind for the guilty plea
hearing.

This is a purely subjective allegation,

There are

34

no allegations that, the police continued to coerce him while
he was awaiting arraignment? or that the police expressly
warned him not to disclose their threats to the court.
This Court has recognised that coercive conduct
may be sufficiently separated from a later guilty plea so as
not to affect the voluntariness of the plea.

In Parker v.

North Carolina? one of the claims made that alleged police
conduct in procuring.a confession in itself tainted a guilty
plea over a month later.

One of the claims was that the

acting coercing of confession tainted the plea a month later.
This Court rejected that claim and it said, "The connection,
if any, between Parker's confession and his plea of guilty
had become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint."
Now, there is a basic difference.

The Court pointed

out that in the interim Parker had been represented by counsel
and had had an opportunity to discuss the facts surrounding
the confession.

But the Court also said that after the

allegedly coercive interrogation, there were no threats,
misrepresentations, promises, or other improper acts by the
State.
Now, petitioner in this case has not alleged that,
there were any threats, misrepresentations, promises, or other
improper acts for the almost 3-weeks period before his plea.
QUESTION:

Is this the pro se petition at that stage?

MR. HUNTINGTON:

Yes.

35
QUESTION:

Well, then, that failure wouldn't be

very crucial, would it?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
QUESTION:

Well, if ha —

Haven't wa treated the pro se petition

as merely the mechanism to get the man into the courtroom?
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Well, there still is a requirement

that the petition set forth facts which, if true, would
entitle him to relief.

And there is a requirement that they

be set. forth with some specificity.

In some cases District.

Courts have appointed counsel to assist the petitioner in
drafting his motion, but. this has not bean required by any
decisions of this Court.
Now, in our view, there is a sound basis in this
Court' s decisions for the general proposition that a defendant.
should be bound by his responses at a guilty plea hearing.
As this Court noted in McCarthy v. United States at. 394 U.S.,
*

there are two basic purposes for the Rule 11 requirement that
a judge personally address a defendant before accepting a
guilty plea.

First, the rule is designed to assist the

judge in making a determination on the voluntariness of the
plea.

Second, the rule is intended to produce, and I quote

from the Court's opinion, "a complete record at the time the
plea is entered of the factors relevant to this voluntariness
determination to enable more expeditious disposition of post
conviction attacks on the constitutional validity of guilty

36

pleas."
Later in the opinion, the Court observed that Rule
11 is designed to eliminate any need to resort to any later
fact-finding proceedings.
Now, wa do not contend that compliance with Rule 11
eliminates the necessity for further fact-finding proceedings
in every case, and I have referred to some of the situations
where it would not.

But we do contend that in this case and

as a general rule, that the record the defendant makes should
bind him against further proceedings.
How, the cases that —

the point I have been trying to — we don't know anything that
happened to that man from the time he was picked up by the
State until he walked in with the U.S. attorney.

that he would be entitled to relief.

Now, he has not alleged

facts which tie together the coercion with his plea.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I understood your brief to concade

that if what he alleges is true, that of course his plea
was coerced, but you simply say they are incredible.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

No, I am not saying — but. we do

true.

But our first argument is that as a

matter of law, that if he is given the opportunity.

I mean,

if he is asked in compliance with Rule 11 were there any
threats and he says, "No, there weren’t," and there are none
of the special circumstances present which we concede would
relieve him from the binding affect of that answer, then as
a matter of law, he is not entitled later on to contradict
that record which he himself made.

And that is what conclusive!}

shows that he is entitled to no relief.
But we don't rely exclusively on that position.
We also say that, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, that if
you look at all of the records, that there is enough here to
show that he was entitled to no relief in any event.
would just refer briefly to those.

And I

We think the fact, that a

central part of his allegations are that ha was innocent,
that he did not rob any bank, that the police convinced him
that he was a bona fide bank robber and told him that he had
robbed this bank at a certain time, well, we think that the
record as a whole refutes this allegation.

First of all,

in the guilty plea hearing, as you pointed out, Mr. Chief
Justice, his answers were very specific.

Yes, he had a

pistol; yes, he held up the teller, and he took the money.
And later at. sentencing, he made the statement that he was

42
under the influence of drugs "when this happened."

And that's

a clear admission of guilt.
The ether factors

very important in his allegations

are the allegations of brutality whan he was arrested.

He

alleged he was clubbed into an unconscious stats of mind at
his home, that he was struck several times with fists and
open hands at. the police station, and that an abdominal gunshot
wound was torn open and began to bleed freely.

He also

asserted he was beaten for asking to see an attorney.

And in

the brief of law attached to his motion he claimed he had
been brutally assaulted, beaten with clubs and blackjacks and
kicked.

Yet the hospital record pertaining to his period of

hospitalization beginning on the night of the arrest makes no
references to any bruises or recent bleedings.

And surely

that would have been in evidence had petitioner suffered the
type of mistreatment that he claims he had suffered.
Wow, we also would say that the 21-month delay
between the guilty plea hearing and the time that he filed
his motion is also indicative of the lack of substance.

It’s

certainly not a controlling point, but we think it does, when
added together with all the other factors, show that the
motion was not well founded.
Now, the question as to whether petitioner was
mentally competent at the time is covered in our brief and I
won51 go into that row.

43
On the waiver of counsel issue, I would like to
just

make a couple of points.

First of all, petitioner was

26 years old, he had a seventh grade education, and by his
own admission, he had a long criminal record and had been
proceeded against in numerous criminal proceedings.

In his

petition at page 11 he admits that he misspoke when he
informed the court that he didn’t have a record at the: guilty
plea hearing and admitted that he had a long record, and also
he referred to FBI records which would indicate that, there had
bean Federal charges as well.
It is thus highly unlikely that he was confused
when the judge advised him of his right, to counsel.
Now, we would also point out that in the light of
this, in the light of the fact that the U.S. attorney had
given him the waiver form, he had signed a waiver form, the
waiver of counsel, the U.S. attorney had given him the
information, and said that he had acknowledged that he under­
stood it, and the information contained tha elements of the
offense, so that we say when you look at this record as a
whole, it shows that there was an intelligent and knowing waive
of counsel and that therefore at that point there was a valid
waiver.
Well, in conclusion, it is our view that tha
judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
