MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-837, EVCO against Jones.
Mr. Schlenker, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENDALL 0. SCHLENKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SCHLENKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case of EVCO v. Jones is before the Court the
second time.
The issue is whether the gross receipts of EVCO from
sales of tangible personal property to customers outside the
State of New Mexico,where delivery is made outside the State
of New Mexico, are exempt from the New Mexico Emergency School
Tax and the Gross Receipts Tax.
New Mexico, of course, is a State which is not a
heavily industrial State and, as a result, perhaps, of the
Atomic Energy Commission and some of the other Government
agencies’ instrumentalities in our State, there have evolved a
number of businesses which deal in scientific and technological
materials of which EVCO is one.
EVCO designs educational programs.

Its customers are

many Government agencies for the State and Federal Government.
It does certain contract work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

4
And, typical of the kind of work it does which is involved in
this case, is the designing of instructional programs for the
IBM Corporation up in Endicott, Mew York, for its use in
training people how to use its typewriters, magnetic tape
selectric typewriters and other modern types of business
equipment.
The products which evolve from this work which EVCG
does consist of camera ready copies of books and training
manuals, film strips for instruction and audio tapes.
Now, this case arises under two different New
Mexico statutes, and for our purposes I believe they can be
considered the same.
The first one was the so-called Emergency School
Tax Act which came about in 1939 and continued along until
about 1961, when we changed the name to the New Mexico Gross
Receipts Tax.
The practical effect of those taxes is the same and
in each case an exemption was contained from the tax for the
sales of tangible personal property to Government agencies
and instrumentalities and to certain non-profit corporations,
In this case, in the lower court's opinion, typical
of these were these sales to the U.S. Forest Service and to
the University of Toledo, and so forth.
Now, the first issue involved in this case initially
was whether EVCG was actually selling tangible personal property

5
or whether it was in fact selling a service which was not
subject, to this exemption.
The Hew Mexico Emergency School Tax contained no
provision regarding interstate commerce.
The Hew Mexico Gross Receipts Tax provided an
exemption in the case of sales which were in interstate
commerce.
Notwithstanding this absence of a provision in the
New Mexico Emergency School Tax, I don’t believe anyone has
ever contended that New Mexico -- that the presence of this
provision one way or another would have any effect, since
I think it has always been fairly clear that if these sales
are in interstate commerce that they would be just as exempt
as they are stated to be under the Gross Receipts Tax.
The New Mexico Court of Appeals decided that EVCO
was selling tangible personal property which took care of a
considerable part of this case, that relating to sales to the
Government and sales to these tax exempt institutions.
However, the Court of Appeals decided that notwith­
standing their determination that tangible personal property
was involved, these sales where delivery was made to IBM, for
example, in New York, were not exempt as being in interstate
commerce.
We came to this Court before on petition for Writ
of Certiorari and the New Mexico Attorney General’s office, at

6
that time, filed a brief in which it was stated that, so far
as the second point was concerned, that the State would now
agree that these sales were exempt as being in interstate
commerce.

They expressed their dissatisfaction with the

determination still about this services versus tangible personal
property point.
This Court sent the case bach, using language in
view of the New Mexico Attorney General's position or con­
cession, that the case was being resubmitted for reconsidera­
tion.
And, in effect, what the New Mexico Court of Appeals
said was, we have reconsidered but we don't change our mind
on this point.
And, we again came back with a petition this time
which was granted.
The State raises this point about the tangible
personal property versus services, but the State’s position on
the second point is that if this is the sale of tangible
personal property that we are correct in our position that
these sales are exempt as being in interstate commerce.
We would like on the case of Adams Manufacturing
Company v. Storen, in which the sales there involved were socalled

nutshipments, in which this Court determined that those

sales were exempt as being in interstate commerce —
Q

I understood it, in reading the briefs, and I

7
understood it when the case was last here, you and the State
of Mew Mexico are in agreement, are you not, that if these
sales are on personal property the tax cannot be imposed?
ME* SCHLEWKER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, we are.

— And then — but the State says that if these

are services then the tax can be imposed.

And what do you say

about that, if these are services?
MR. SCHLENKER:

I would say that if these had been

determined to be services that the tax could be imposed.
Q

So there is no disagreement between you, is there?

And, therefore the issue for us and the only issue is whether
or not these are services or tangible personal property?
Is that the only issue?
MR. SCHLEMER:

Your Honor, we don’t believe that

that would be an issue that the Court will want to even —
Q

Well, I wouldn’t think, so either.
Well, you are in total agreement aren’t you?
MR. SGHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor, except that we

are obligated on several thousand dollars worth of taxes
that we seem to be in complete agreement with everybody about
but we nevertheless -»
Q

Well, isn’t the issue whether or not these are

services or tangible personal property?
MR. SCHLENKER: Well, Your Honor, no, the Mew Mexico
Court of Appeals has already determined that these are tangible

b

person I property ~~
Q

I read its opinion to say that we don't need to

decide on the remand from this Court when it went back the
second time.

We don't need to decide it because whether it

is services or tangible personal property the tax is a valid
tax.

Isn't that what it said?
ME. SCHLENKER:

I think that's what they say.

I think that's the question that they had is that,
in effect, —»
Q

And you both agree that the Court was wrong?
MR. SCHLENKER:

Q

Yes*

And you both agree that if it is tangible personal

property the tax cannot be imposed, and that if it is services,
the tax can be imposed.
MR. SCHLENKER:
Q

Yes, sir, we certainly do.

Well, then, isn't the only issue that divides you

the factual issue of whether or not this is tangible personal
property or services?
MR, SCHLENKER:

No, Your Honor, because the Court

of Appeals in the State of New Mexico says that it is tangible
personal property, but they say that it is subject to the tax
notwithstanding the fact that it is tangible personal property,
Q

We have an adversary system here.

Now, wait, I am
1

talking about you and your opponent in this lawsuit.
MR. SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

9
Q

Aren’t you in complete agreement as to the controlling

legal principles involved, and isn’t your only difference of
opinion the -** or difference between you relates to whether or
not these are services or tangible personal property?
MR. SCHLEMRER:

Well, I believe we are in agreement

about the principles which apply, but the State dees have an
assessment involving several thousand dollars, and it is
relying on our Court’s opinion to enforce that assessment.
Q

Well, here it comes and says that if this is personal

property this tax cannot be imposed, doesn't it?
read its brief that way?
MR. SCHLENKER:
Q

Don't you

The State.
Wo, Your Honor.

Well, then I misunderstood what you just told me.
MR, SCHLENKER:

That's our problem.

I believe the

State says all the way with respect to all of these if they
are tangible personal property -~
Q

Yes.
MR. SCHLENKER:

— but they are saying that we have

a right to tax this notwithstanding it, that the petitioner
should apportion the tax in this case.

Now, under the appor**

tioraaent idea, we believe that the apportionment we are to
make is between intra-State and interstate sales and we believe
those are fairly clear.
It appears, however, that the New Mexico Court is
concerned about apportionment of something else.

They are

10
reviewing this as if it were a value-added tax, I believe.
Q

You have a judgment of the highest Court of Hew

Mexico against you on your liability for the tax, and I take
it the only reason we would be reviewing it is to hear your
contention that it is unconstitutional for the highest Court
of New Mexico to have done what it did.
So you’ve got to show us in some way, I take it, that
what the New Mexico Court of Appeals has done is inconsistent
with the Federal Constitution, regardless of what label is
put on it.
MR. SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

We say that the decision of the New Mexico Court of
Appeals is incorrect under the authority of Adams Manufacturing
Company v. Sfcoren, and these subsequent cases that reaffirm
that same position.
They are relying on the case of General Motors Co.
v. Washington a3 authority for their decision in the case, and
that case involved in-State — or

inshipments to the State

of Washington.
This Court has drawn these distinctions three times,
as I understand it,

outshipments which cannot be taxed by

the shipping State,

lashipmants which can, and then the

manufacturing type « manufacturing tax, which is also a
constitutional tax.
Q

Does the record, in fact, show that these receipts

11
were taxed by any other State?
MR. SCHLEMER:
Q

No, Your Honor, it does not.

One other question.

Can we go behind the New

Mexico Court’s characterisation of its State tax?

It seems

to disagree with its revenue commissioner.
MR. SCHLEHXER:

Yes, Your Honor, our gross fecipts

tax is very much like the Indiana gross income tax of 1933,
which was the -- which was involved in Mams and Freeman v.
Hiss It and International Harvester, ail of those cases.

It is

a gross receipts tax.
The Cousnissioner of Revenue,under the Gross Receipts
Tax Act which came in 1961, did issue a ruling which is to the
effect that our sales would be exempt if, in fact, they are
tangible personal property.
That is the determination that has been made,that
they are.
Q

I share Justice Stewart’s confusion.

I get the

impression here that your side and the opposing side have a
common enemy in the finding of the Court of Appeals.
MR. SCHLEHRSR:

Well, Your Honor, initially, the

Attorney General’s Office took the position that the Court of
Appeals followed... The Attorney General’s office cimaged its
position after the decision.
The real vice in that, I believe, is that we also
have a use tax, and I believe that the use tax would be placed

12
in jeopardy if we had a Court decision that we could impose
the gross receipts tax on the
the

outshipments, the use tax on

inshipments.
Q

I am groping for the controversy between you and

your friend here.
MR. SCHLENKER:

Your Honor, when we went back to the

Court of Appeals,we didn't really know what we were going for,
except that we had a substantial tax liability which had been
sustained by their decision.
This Court had sent the case back for reconsideration
and,in effect, our Court has said that even though these are
outshipments

of personal property, nevertheless we can impose

the tax.
Q

Two opinions, and they happen to be by the same

judge, Judge Oman.
On page A-9, this is his first opinion, he said,
"The sole question is therefore whether or not the contracts
constitute a sales of tangible personal property within the
contemplation of the statutes or were contracts for the
performance of services."
And so he said that’s the sole question for him to
decide, and then the case came up here and it was remanded.
And, on remand, on page A-31, same judge for the same Court,
says, "We fail to understand how a tax on this aspect of
interstate commerce can be constitutionally fair and valid if

13
the

it arises out of a contract for services, but

constitutionally unfair and invalid when these same incidents
arise out of a contract of sale.
,fIn our opinion, taxable incidents are equally
apparent and are ascertainable with equal ease whether they
arise out of a contract of sale or out of a contract for
services.'*
So the first time around^ he said the sola question
was whether they were tangible personal property or services,
and the second time around, he said it didn’t make any differ­
ence.
Isn't that part of the problem in this case?
It is part of my problem in reading this.
MR. SCHLENKER:

In the case where he said it’s the

sole question, he went on subsequently in the same opinion to
consider the second question.
Q

Which is the second question?
MR. SCHLENKER:

The matter of the taxability once

its determined that the products are tangible personal
property.
Q

Where is that in these opinions?
I understood, as I suggested in my questions, that

the only difference between you and your adversery here in
this Court -MR. SCHLENKER:

It is on A-11, Your Honor, where it

14
begins, ‘’Under its second point»,,”
Q

That’s the opinion that accompanied the judgment

that was vacated and set aside, isn’t it?
MR, SCHLENKER:
Page

Wo, that's in the first opinion,

A-11.
Q

Wo, 1 didn’t think so,

I thought the •— I see, that’s

the one before us now.
MR, SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

We had the two questions squarely presented, one on
the tangible personal property versus service and then the
second one, that was a threshold question, once the determina­
tion was made.
I oelieve that the New Mexico Court of Appeals is
just saying that it does not agree with the laws estaolished
by this Court,
Q

May X follow up on this question that you have been

discussing?
Look at Appendix A-&, where it says the first
opinion of the New Mexico Court, the first full paragraph
starts out by saying, "The taxpayer contends that these
contracts constituted sales of tangiule personal property. ’
Then, in the last sentence, the Court says, J,We agree
with the position of the taxpayer,”
MR, SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor,

Now, I construe that as a finding and a holding by

15

the New Mexico Court that it construes these sales to ue of
taagiole personal property under your statute.
Now, in Its second opinion, after the remand,
although it did say, as you and Justice Stewart have pointed
out, that it doesn’t see any legal consequence following that
would be different if it construed the sales to be of services,
nevertheless it concludes by saying we reinstate and reaffirm
the first opinion.
Now, I have construed that,until this argument, that
that was a reaffirmation of a prior holding that the sales
were of tangible personal property,
MR. SCHLENKER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that your position?
MR. SCHLENKEPw:

Yes, Your Honor, they did reaffirm

that, but then they went on to say about this second point
that the parties were in agreement on if this was tangible
personal property, that we can’t see the distinction that the
U.S. Supreme Court has drawn that this would ue taxaule if
it wa3 services and not taxaule if it was tangible personal
property.
Q

But if vie accept the position of your Court that

this is tangible personal property, then you are uoth in
agreement that that’s the end of this case, as X understand
it.
MR. SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor. Except that we’ve

16

asked this time that the remand ue with instructions as to
the kind of relief which should be granted.
We got back for reconsideration before and the
reconsideration
Q

What you are really asking us to say is that your

Court is wrong, that there is a distinction between services
and sales.

And where it is sales, as, they, say.. it is, comes

tax as unconstitutional reverse.
That's what you want us to do?
MR. 6CHLEMER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, exactly,

You are both asking to be reversed, are you not?
MR. SCHLENKER:

We are except that the State would

like to raise this tangible personal property versus services
issue.
Q
hear him.

How can that be?

It maybe can't.

We’ll have to

But, if we are concluded by the holding of your

Court that it is on tangible personal property, then,thus,
isn't that the framework within the constitutional question
should be decided?
MR. SCHLENKER:

We maintain that that's exactly

correct, Your Honor.
Q

Mr. Schlenker, incidentally, where do we find the

facts in this case?

I don’t seem to have an appendix.

MR., SCHLENKER:

The facts upon which we rely were

stipulated in the stipulation which is material.

It is in the

17
opinion of the Court,
Q

Aren't there two stipulations in the file?

MR, SCHLENKER:
Q

Not that I recall , Your Honorv

Has there been a supervening change in the Mew

Mexico law that would make -- X got that intimation from one
of the briefs — that, perhaps this would not oe a recurring
question in Hew Mexico?
MR. SCHLENKER:

It would not be in the sense that

if the Bureau of Revenue follows its existing regulation that
it would just cot raise it in any subsequent case.
It does have a ruling in effect which is in the
Court's opinion at the — beginning on the uottom of A-13.
We believe that that exactly fits our situation.
"Receipts of New Mexico sellers from sales of property to non­
residents of New Mexico where delivery is made out-of-state by
seller'3 vehicle, U.S. Mail, or common carrier are receipts from
transactions in interstate commerce and such receipts may be
deducted from the gross receipts of the seller*"
Now, that was in existence and our Court expressed
doubts about it.

They said, well, if that is a correct state-

ment of the law, then it wasn't in effect at the time that
the taxable transactions arose here.
Q

Was there something auout the handling of the case

that could be explained to us to shed some light on it, that
maybe you feel a little reticent about explaining?

18-19
ME..SCHLENKER:

Your Honor, I wish I could explain

more about the case.
X can understand why it is confusing,

It is

confusing to all the lawyers involved in the case, and our
clients, we know that.
There are no hidden —
Q

Was this argued earlier before the New Mexico

Supreme Court?
MR. SCHLENKER:
Q

Twice, Your Honor.

Is there anything in the colloquoy between you and

the members of that Court which would shed light on this?
MR. SCHLENKER,:

One of the judges of the three

stated that he wanted me to know that the decision had not
been unanimous, as it appeared the first time.
Q

And the second time?
MR, SCHLENKER:

I

Q

Haven’t been back.

Q

Mr„ ScMeriker,’

don’t know, I haven’t —

won’t about one more trip up here

eat up the whole tax?
MR. SCHLENKER:

Well, we didn’t get to come up

last time, Your Honor, the case was sent back —
Q

It was sent back on what was basically a confession

of errors, maybe by the State, and now reinstating the words
that Mr. Justice Powell read to you, reinstating the previous
opinion, the State has confirmed and repeated the error»

20
And your adversary, as I read his brief, agrees
with that.
Isn’t that true?
And, yet, as you say, you still have a tax bill to
pay.
MR, SCHLENKERf

Yes, Your Honor, that's what we

believe our situation is today.
Q

What it comes down to is that the State and the

State's Supreme Court seem to have some disagreement,
SCHLENKER:

Actually, the Court of Appeals,

Judge Oman is now on the State Supreme Court.
Q

Well, I meant the Court of Appeals.
MR, SCHLENKER:

Q

Yes, sir.

May I sa% again,the Court of Appeals is your common

adversary?
MR, SCHLENKER:
Q

Apparently so, Your Honor,

Perhaps the Attorney General will shed more light

on it than we have had.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cook.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. COOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. COOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves two issues which were presented
to the New Mexico Court of Appeals.

21
The first issue decided by the lower court was that
certain instructional materials which were developed and
created by the petitioner and sold as camera ready copies were
as a matter of law tangible personal property.
Receipts from sales of this tangible personal
property to the United States and the Research Foundation of
the University of Toledo were decided to be exempt from the
taxes at issue here,
Q

As a matter of your statute, isn’t that right?
MR, COOK:

Q

As a matter of law, by the Court,

By your statutory" law, your tax law, isn't that

right?
MR* COOK:

Well, Your Honor, we say that the grounds

are ambiguous with regard to why the Court of Appeals reached
the decision on the services-tangible issue,
Q

Well, doesn't your tax law exempt sales to govern^

mental bodies?
MR, COOK:

Sales of tangible personal property to

governmental bodies, yes, Justice,
Q

And as I read this first opinion, they -** you were

just applying your statute in exempting those.
MR. COOK:

Once they decided what was being sold

was tangible personal property, yes, Justice.
The second issue concerns sales to ouyers who were
outside New Mexico

and delivery was outside Mew Mexico,

22

The subject matter of those sales was not materially
different.

The Mew Mexico Court of Appeals held that the

petitioners receipts from these sales were suujeet to tax.
These sales were clearly under the Mew Mexico Court of Appeals
reasoning outshipments of tangible personal property»
However, the Court held that petitioner's receipts
from these transactions were subject to tax, and decided that
these receipts could be subject to tax without doing violence
to the interstate Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Respondent contends that the New Mexico Court of
Appeals incorrectly decided both issues.

However, the error

with regard to the first issue caused and resulted in error
in the second issue,
Q

May I be sure I understand?

You now are contending

that the Court was wrong in holding that these were sales of
tangible personal property?
MR. COOK:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And you are further saying that,if these were sales

of tangible personal property, the Court was wrong in holding
that the tax could validly be imposed,
»

MR. COOK:

Yes, Justice.

How do we second guess the Court of Appeals whether
these were sales of tangible personal property?

That's an

inter — that's -« as applied, in any event, your Court of
Appeals said these were for the purposes of your statute.

23
Isn’t that so?
That’s a matter of statutory construction in the
sense of application of these particular materials, isn’t it?
How do we then --do you agree with that?
Or have we any jurisdiction of disagreement?
MR. COOK:

Well, if I might expand a little on

my answer.
The Gourt of Appeals stated in the first opinion
that the — regarding the issue of services versus tangibles
— said the adoption of the position taken by the Commissioner
would result in the ultimate imposition of taxes, such as
those here involved, upon agencies and institutions which the
Legislature intended should be exempt therefrom, or result
in a tax burden being shifted to other taxable customers of
the taxpayer.
neither of these results would be consistent with
the legislative intent.
Shifting the tax burden would be inconsistent with
the object of requiring a tax burden to fall with uniformity
and equality upon the class of persons sought to be taxed.
In support of this statement, the Court of Appeals
decided — on another Court of Appeals case — in Hew Mexico
Electric Service Company v, Jones.
The reasoning that resulted in the statement X have
read seems to be that if the Commissioner’s decision in order

%ri£h respect to the issue of service versus tangible personal
property had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the effect
would be a denial of equal protection to taxpayers performing
services for the United States or any agency or instrumentality
thereof.
The New Mexico Electric Service Company case which
was decided by the Court of Appeals raised issues under both
the Equal Protection Provisions of the United States and the
New Mexico Constitution.
Respondent contends that this reasoning of the New
Mexico Court of Appeals regarding the requirements of
equal protection 13 erroneous because the imposition of the
tax was on the seller and there was no showing that sellers
of services to these agencies or organizations, as a class *—
that sellers as a class — were treated differently for .
purposes of taxation.
If the imposition of the taxes at issue here is on
receipts from the performance of services rather than receipts
from the sale of tangible personal property, the respondent
contends that the tax is not repugnant to the United States
Constitution*
And that seems to be the basis for part of the New
Mexico Court of Appeals decision with, regard to the first
issue.
There appears to respondent to be at least obscurity

25

as to the precise grounds for the judgment in the New Mexico
Court of Appeals on the first issue*
Although we haven't cited this case in our briefs»
in view of the —
Q

1 don't see, however erroneous may be the basis

in supporting these — for our holding that these — that this
particular taxpayer was taxed on tangibles — however, erroneou
that basis is, how can we set aside that conclusion of your
Court of Appeals? Whether the error — if it is error «- has
its roots in misapplication of the Federal Constitution or'
not, as to this taxpayer, at least.
MR, SCHLENKER:

Well, Justice, we take it that the

Court of Appeals was deciding a Federal question — or possibly
deciding a Federal question — when they held that the sales
were of tangibles.
Wow, if that was a Federal question which was
decided erroneously, then under the rules regarding certiorari
we say that that Federal question can be presented to this
Court,
Q

Do you want us to affirm the judgment of the Court

of Appeals?
MR* COOK:

No, Your Honor,

Ho, Justice*

lie want the decision reversed.
And you .-ace? the appellee*

Generally, it is the

appellant who wants the decision reversed*

MR. COOK:

Well, appellant wants the decision

reversed, but he wants it reversed or. the second issue — for
a different reason
Q

Well, didn't the (inaudible)
MR. COOK:

The Court of Appeals gave us direction

regarding the assessment — gave the Bureau of Revenue
direction.
Q

Can they do that under your law?
MR. COOK:

Legally,

We are to abide by the decisions of the

Court of Appeals once cases are presented to them regarding
tax liability/
Q

But you can't, on your own — the Attorney General5

office can't — withdraw an assessment once it is made?
MR. COOK:

We can abate the assessment.

The

procedure is abatement, Justice, and we can abate it if it is
erroneous as a matter of law or erroneous as to the figures.
Q

Well, aren’t you now saying this is related to the

matter of law?
MR. COOK:

We are saying that.

However, the Court

of Appeals,who decided this case, says it is not erroneous.
Q

You want us to say it?

Q

If you’ve got a judgment on behalf of your bureau

and the other side complains that it violates the Federal
Constitution, why don’t you corns in and try to uphold it?
Q

Or else go back home and compromise it.

27

Q

Tell me, Mr. Cook, had your Court: of Appeals

correctly said this was services and not tangibles, which Is
the position pu are urging on us, then, I cake it, this
assessment — your view would be the taxpayer had to pay?
Isn't that right?
MR. COOK:
Q

Yes.

Well, aren't you — or should you — really be here

asking us to affirm the assessment of the Court of Appeals on
the ground that they were wrong in saying that this was on
tangibles, that really it was on services, and, therefore,
you were entitled to make the assessment and to collect it?
MR. COOK:
Q

Yes, Justice.

Well, now, really, you should be asking us to

affirm judgment of assessment, shouldn't you?
MR. COOK:

Well, to reverse on the grounds —

•. A"

Well, you want us to say that we affirm the assess**
ment because the reasons they gave are wrong and the right
reasons would be that this is on services and not on —
isn't that it?
MR. COOK:

Yes, Justice.

Q

Well, that's not really reversal, I suppose.

Q

The reason is basically a factual one, not a

question of State law, I take it.
You are saying that as a matter of fact these
transactions were of a particular nature.

However, the Court

2b
of Appeals of New Mexico may have characterized them under
the statute►
MR. COOK:

That’s correct, Justice.

In the case of State of Minnesota v. National Tea
Company which is not cited in respondent's brief

it is 309

US 551 —• there was obscurity in the decision of the Supreme
Court of Minnesota in a tax case involving graduated gross
sales tax on chainstores*
This obscurity arose because of discretion by the
Supreme Court of Minnesota of the Equal Protection Provisions
of the Fifteenth Amendment,and referencing the syllabus of
that case to a provision of the Minnesota Constitution, which
provided that fcaxQs shall be uniform upon the same class of
subjects.
In Minnesota v. National Tea Company, it was contended
that the United States Supreme Court should not take juris­
diction because of the rule that jurisdiction is not taken
where a judgment of a State Court rests on two grounds, one
involving a Federal question and the other not.
However, there was found to be obscurity as to the
grounds for the decision.

Jurisdiction was taken.

The case

was remanded to the Supreme Court to resolve the ambiguities
of the decision.
In the course of the opinion, this Court stated:
"This Court has frequently held that in the exercise of its

29
appellate jurisdiction, it has the power not only to correct
errors of law in the judgment and the review, but also to make
such disposition of the case as justice requires »,s
Q

Mr. Cook, would you be satisfied if we took the

following action:

having remanded this case to the Court of

Appeals, having accomplished nothing by that, at the urging of
both parties, we now reverse decision of the Court of Appeals,
period.

Would that satisfy?
Ml. COOK:

We would rather have the decision reversed

than have it stand as now, but we would prefer that the decision
be changed as to the grounds with regard to —
Q

You all imposed the tax, because you submit that

you can constitutionally and lawfully do so if it is a tax
on personal services, is that right?
Q

Why would you prefer to have it reversed along the

lines Justice Marshall has suggested than to have it stand as
it is now?
MR. COOK:

We would prefer to have the reasoning

changed and have it affirmed; but if we can't get that,we would
prefer to have it reversed.
Q

Why?
MR. COOK:

Because as it stands now, we think that

the case is an improper construction of the law.
Q

Of State law?
MR. COOK:

With regard to taxation of outshipmenfcs

30
of tangible personal property —
Q

You. don't think you have any constitutional power

to tax outshipmenfcs of tangible personal property?
MR. COOK:
Q

That's our argument,

And the way the Court of Appeals is construing the

position, you do have it, they say.

And you say you don't

have it under the decisions of this Court.
Q

And this is going to embarrass the adrainistration

of your tax program in many other situations, is that it?
MR. COOK:

Well, it will cause difficulties in

administration of the tax program.

The administrator **- the

Commissioner of Revenue ~~ has reviewed this, he lias directed
counsel to argue in this manner,
arguable.

I feel that the case is

I don't feel that as counsel that I am shirking

my duty.
However, the position of the administrator is the
one, as client, that we adhere to,
Q

In that position, do I understand it correctly,

you are submitting that the basic issue before us is whether
or not this is personal property or services. And if the
Court below was wrong in holding it was personal property,
then you are asking us to hold that these were services,
MR, COOK;
Q

Yes, Justice,

And, having held that, you are then saying — or

asking us to hold that the tax imposed on services was

31
constitutionally valid.
MR. COOK;
Q

Is that it?
MR. COOK:

Q

Yes» Justice Stewart.

Yes*

What do we do with the judgment of the Court?

We affirm it then, don’t we?
HR. COOK;
Q

Yes, Justice.

And your key submission, I gather, has to be that

this is whether it’s on tangibles or on services, is a
Federal question.
MR. COOK:
Q

Mot otherwise can we pass on it,
Yes, Justice.

This really is exactly the same position you had

when the case was here before, isn't it?
MR. COOK:
Q

Yes, Justice.

Which caused us to remand the case to the Court

of Appeals —
MR. COOK:

Yes, Justice.

We requested that we be allowed to submit briefs
after the case was remanded to the Mew Mexico Court of
Appeals.

They said no briefs.
We made this same argument regarding the Federal

question involving the Equal Protection Clause at oral
argument before the New Mexico Court of Appeals, although it
is not referenced in their second opinion, as such.
Q

Out of curiosity,

was: there a certiorari

32
jurisdiction of your Supreme Court from the Court of Appeals?
MR. COOK:
Q

And did they refuse to review it?
MR. COOK:

Q

Yes, Justice.

How many on your Supreme Court?
MR, COOK:

Q

Yes«

Five, Justice.

And one of them sat in this case on the Court of

Appeals ?
MR. COOK:

Yes, Justice*

He is now moved.

He was the judge who offered the

original opinion.
Q

Can you shed any light on why they denied certiorari

Was it possibly on the grounds that it was de minimus in
their view?
MR. COOK:

Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, on the

reason why the Mew Mexico Supreme Court denied?
Q

Yes.
MR. COOK:

Q

Did you oppose it officially?

m.
Q

X have no idea.

COOK:

No*

Did you join in requesting it?
MR. COOK:

No*

We did after the Initial easea

After the remand,

we dIda1t join in petitioning the New Mexico Supreme Court
for certiorari.

33
Q

How much tax is involved here in this case?
MR, COOK:

X believe that the total assessment was

about $35,000.
Q

Is that the tax?
MEL COOK:

Q

Tax.

Do I understand, is it likely to happen again in

the future, as far as EVCO is concerned?
MR. COOK:

Well, with regard to the question

Justice Rehnquist asked, the statutes of New Mexico have
been remanded.
Section 72, 16A, 14*12, came in after the period
involved in this assessment.
That deduction

provides for deduction for services

performed in Mew Mexico when initial use of the product
of the services is outside New Mexico.
However, the buyer outside New Mexico was required
to deliver a non-taxable transaction certificate regarding this
sale, so if this matter had come up under current law and
a certificate had been issued then the sale would have been
deductible from the gross receipts tax.
Respondent submits that there was error of law
present in the decision of the New Mexico Court of Appeals
on the first point.

That error presented a Federal question

on the ground that the State statute was held repugnant to
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

34
I*ve been over Chat,
Even if it is decided that the New Mexico Court of
Appeals did not completely decide the first issue

on

the

grounds that the State statutes were repugnant to the Equal
Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
United States Constitution, the decision does not present
-- does present — an uncertainty as was present in Minnesota
v> National Tea Company*
Respondent submits that if ambiguity is present,
that ambiguity should be resolved before the interstate
commerce question is considered*
If the first issue of the case was decided on
incorrect grounds,that the exception or deduction provisions
which were limited to receipts from selling tangible personal
property, were repugnant to the Equal Protections Provisions
of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the issue could be resolved
♦

•'

-jv

as a question of fact rather than a question of law»
However, facts which would substantially support
the Commissioner of Revenue’s decision that the transactions
which resulted in the tax were from the performance of services,
if it is a fact question.
If it is decided that the first issue was decided
as a matter of State law or that the issue was fully decided
on both Federal grounds and State grounds, then respondent
agrees with petitioner as to the decision of the Court of

35
Appeals on the second point, which concerns the application
of the commerce clause. Article 1, Sec. 8, of the United
States Constifcion.
The decisions of this Court in Freeman v, Hswif
J» D, Adams Manufacturing Company y» Storen hold that if
there is a risk of a double fax burden,the tax would be
forbidden under the Commerce Clause, and that this would be
so even if apportionment was accomplished.
. The reason we think this is the rule is because the
destination State could impose a use or compensating tax on
full value of the items when they came to rest in the destin­
ation State.
The destination State could also impose, as an
alternative, impose a gross receipts tax on the receipts from
the subsequent sale of the items, if the seller had sufficient
contact with the destination State, as was done in General
Motors v. Washington.
Respondents emphasize that our contention is that
the risk of a double tax burden is all that is required to
forbid the tax on receipts from an;outshipment of tangible
personal property.
This, we think, is clear from the following statement
in J. D* Adams case.

The statement reads:

"The vice of the

statute, as applied to receipts from interstate sales is that
the tax includes in its measure,without apportionment, receipts

36
derived from activities in interstate commerce, and that the
exaction is of such a character that if lawful it may in
substance be laid to the fullest extent by States in which
the goods are sold as well as those in which they are manu~
fac tured."
Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to the
risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce is
not exposed, and which the Commerce Clause forbids*
The Adams case distinguishes a gross receipts tax
on outshipments from a tax on manufacturing measured by gross
receipts*
The taxes at issue lie re are clearly not taxes imposed
**

on the activity of manufacturing.
In this case, there was no showing in the record
and no argument that there was a possibility of another State
taxing or attempting to tax any receipts from the activities
incident to the performance of the contracts*
Therefore, this Court said that EVCO then had failed
the Court of Appeals said — in its burden of showing an
unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce, and the question
of multiple taxation was not before the Court.
Respondent points out that it would be very difficult,
if not almost impossible, for the record to reflect the pos­
sibility of another State taxing these transactione*

37
Also, with respect to this, the following statement
from Freeman v.Hewit seems particularly applicable;
"The immunities implicit in the Commerce Clause and
the potential taxing power of a State, can hardly be made to
depend,in the world of practical affairs, on the shifting
incidents of the varying tax laws of the various States at
a particular moment."
X have no further argument,,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,
I would like to respond to Mr, Justice Marshall's
question about the relief to be granted.
Mr. Justice, you asked if the State would be
satisfied with a reversal.

Court is considering that*

the question was asked of counsel about why couldn't, you know,

Certainly, we would have liked to have done that

Doesn't the Attorney General of the State have that

power?
MR. SCHLENKERs

If the Attorney General has that

power, they've declined to exercise it in this case,
Q

Of course, we can't compel the Attorney General to

do anything*
MR. SCHLENKER:

Yes, Your Honor, however, if the

Court of Appeals is reversed, I believe the action will be
clear then for the Bureau of Revenue.

You are the petitioner in this case.

you to say that you dreaded the idea of a reversal?
