MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: '. We will hear arguments
next, in No. 71-1598, Hodgson against Arnheim and Neely.
Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to review
a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, holding that elevator operators, cleaning
ladies, and other operating maintenance and personnel at
eight office buildings and one apartment complex in the
Pittsburgh area managed by respondent Arnheim and Neely are
not entitled to the protection of the Fair Labor Standard
Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions.
The decision below conflicts with the decision of
the Fourth Circuit involving identical issues and holding
that the employees were covered.
Arnheim is a real estate firm engaged, among other
activities, in the management of office buildings and
apartment houses as agents for the owners of such buildings.
At the time this suit 'was brought, they managed a title of
nine such buildings for various unrelated owners.
Arnheim's management activities are carried out

4
under basically identical contracts with each of the
building owners under which Arnheim assumes all of the
functions of managing and operating the buildings, including
the procurement of tenants, the negotiation and enforcement
of leases, the collection of rents, arrangement for
utilities and other services? in 3hort, all aspects of the
operation of the buildings.
Arnheim5 s business is conducted from its central
office and managed by supervisory management personnel
operating out of that central office.
With respect to each building, Arnheim collects
the rents, deposits them in separate bank accounts, and. uses
the funds to pay the operating expenses of the buildings to
pay its commission and to remit the balance to the owner.
Arnheiru has extensive responsibilities in connection
with personnel employed at the various buildings, and I am
talking about

such personnel as elevator operators,

cleaning ladies, watchmen, building engineers, and so on,
The functions and responsibilities of Arnheim with respect
to these personnel are spelled out in detail on a stipulation
that was filed in the district court- and it is in the
appendix and also at pages 5 and 6 of our brief.
Briefly summarized, these functions involved
hiring, promotion, and firing of all personnel? supervision
of their performance of their employment? making work

5
assignments arid scheduling the

time of work; negotiating

union contracts; determining rates of pay and benefits;
preparing payroll and maintenance of other employee records;
and payment of salaries.
In short, every conceivable incident of the
employer-employee relationship is encompassed in Arnheim's
responsibility, although the owners are consulted and enjoy
a veto with respect to certain matters such as the rates of
pay and promotions.
Q

Are these personnel shifted from one building

to another?
MR. FREY %

I do not believe that the

reflects that they are shifted.

record

They are employed for a

particular building.
Q

It is every conceivable relationship except

that of employer and employee, is it not?
MR. FREY;

Well, X would say that it is a

relationship of employer and employee.

Our position is—and

I think this Court has clearly held, certainly in the
context of the Fair Labor Standards Act-—that in determining
the employer-employee relationship, we do not look solely
at the commonlaw concepts, and in any event, even if you did,
the right to hire, the right to fire, even if it is a shared
responsibility with another person, gives you a status as an
employer.

6

Q

As I understand it, for each building there

is a separate bank account?
MR. FREY:
Q

There is a separate bank-—•

And the employees in that building are paid

from that account?
■MR. FREY:
Q

Are those checks drawn by—

MR. FREY:
Q

That is correct.

By Arnheim and Neely.

They are—•

MR. FREY;

Yes, it is an Arnheim and Neely account.

It would be labeled Arnheim and Neely Clark Building Account.
Q

I see.

Suppose there are insufficient funds

or something to pay the current salary', whatever it is?
MR. FREY:
Q

That never arises?

MR. FREY:
arises.

Well—

The record does not indicate that that

Our position in such an instance—suppose the

building owner went bankrupt, and I will come to this a little
later—our position would be that Arnheim would be
responsible for payment of minimum wages.

But Arnheim is

under the act an employer in that sense.

And it has every

power that an employer has.
Q

If that is so, then if it so happened—-not

because the building was bankrupt but because there simply
were not enough funds to pay the current bills—you say that

7
Arnhaim would still be in law obliged to pay the minimum
wage?
MR. PREY:

That would be our position.

I do not

think that that 1b essential to the disposition of this
case „
Q

Under the Fair Labor Standards Act?

MR. FREY:

Under the Fair Labor Standards Act

their responsibility to pay the light bill would be a matter
of state law and of contract between them and the building
owner.

But here we have a special situation, which is that

they do serve as employers these people under the act, and
if these people were entitled to the act’s protection,

then

the employers are liable to see that they get it, and that
is both Arnheim in this case and the building owners, and I.
will expand on this shortly.
Q

Mr. Frey, am I correct in my impression the

Third Circuit decided the employer issue in the Government's
favor?
MR. FREY:
Q

That is correct. Your Honor.

And there is no cause petition here?

MR. FREY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Again, later I think 1 will indicate that there is
an argument, that is made that this is somehow still relevant
to the enterprise question which is really before the Court
today, but we think that argument is fallacious.

8

The Secretary of Labor brought suit in district
court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to compel
Arnheim and Neely to comply with the minimum wage, the
overtime, and the record-keeping provisions of the act.
Arnheim raised basically four defenses.
First, it contended that it was not the employer
of these? employees, that the building owner was.

The

district court rejected that contention and looked both at
the relationship that Arnheim actually had to these
employees and to the definition in the act and held that it
was an employer.
Secondly, Arnheim contended that in determining
whether the dollar volume requirements of the act are met,
the Court should consider only Arnheim*s commissions and not
the gx-oss rents from the buildings.

This argument too was

rejected by the district court.
Thirdly, and this is the key issue in this case
today, Arnheim contended that its business was not. an
enterprise under the act but rather that the employees at
these buildings were employed in as many different enterprises
as there were separate building owners.
Finally, an issue that is not raised by either
side here, there was an issue regarding the nexus to
interstate commerce, and the district court held that prior
to February 1, 1967, the necessary nexus did not exist and

9

dismissed the Secretary's suit as to that prior period
subsequent to February 1, 1967 when the statute was amended?
the court held that the necessary nexus did exist and we do
not understand that issue to be contested.
On appeal, the Third Circuit held in agreement
with the Government's position and the district court that
Arnheim is an employer of these employees, under the act..,
It secondly held, also in agreement with the
Government and with the district court, that the proper
measure of gross revenues for purposes of determining
coverage under Section 3(s) of the act is rent and not merely
Arnheim8 s commissions u
However, it agreed with Arnheim that it was not
conducting a single enterprise but rather as many different
enterprises as there were building owners.

Accordingly, it

remanded the case to the district court far a hearing whether
any of -these separate enterprises met the dollar volume
requirements of the act to create an enterprise in which the
employees would be covered.
Our petition for certiorari raised solely the issue
of the correctness of the Court of Appeals8 definition of
Arnheim's enterprise.

No cross petition

was filed with

respect to the issues won by the Government below, nor were
they raised in the brief in opposition to the certiorari
petition.

10
Turning to the merits, the Government1s theory is
that these employees are employed in Arnheim and Neely's
enterprise, the management of office and apartment buildings
for others, and that the activities of all the buildings
Arnheim manages are part of a single enterprise.
The question presented to this Court is fundamentally
one of interpretation of the provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act.

We submit these provisions are susceptible

of only one interpretation, and that interpretation provides
coverage for these employees.
Let us take John Doe, an elevator operator in one
of the buildings that Arnheim manages.

In order to determine

whether he is protected by the minimum, wage provisions which
are contained in Section 6 of the act, we begin by looking
at Section 6, which says, "Every employer shall pay to each
of his employees"—-and I am skipping to the relevant part--"employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce, wages at certain rates."
The phrase "employed in an enterprise engaged in
commerce or the production of goods for commerce" is defined
in Section 3(s).

It is there defined as

an enterprise whose

annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not
less than $500,000, if we are talking about the period, from
February, 1967 to January, 1969.
So. the question, is, Is John Doe employed in an

11
enterprise which has the necessary dollar volumes?
Enterprise is defined in Section 3(r) and here we
are at the crux of the case»

The relevant portion says that

an enterprise means the related activities performed either
through unified operation or common control by any person or
persons for a common business purpose, and includes all such
activities whether performed in one or more establishments
or by one or more corporate or other organizational units.
Arnheim's activities, as a manager of office and
apartment buildings for others, clearly constitute a single
enterprise under this definition.

There are three elements

that need to bs met.
Are there related activities?

And Congress has not

defined related activities per se, but the legislative history
makes it clear that it considers related activities to be
those that are the same or similar.

Looking at Arnheim's

activities at each of the office buildings and apartment
buildings that it manages , it does the same* thing under
basically the seme agreement with the building owner, clearly
related activities, we submit.
The second requirement is, Are these activities
performed through unified operation or common control?

The

common, control requirement is satisfied if they are performed
by a single company.

Arnheim and Neely, Incorporated runs

the business of Arnheim and Neely, Incorporated, and that is

12
what we are talking about here»

The common control reqvnireisen

is met»
In addition, although it is not necessary to meet
both, Arnheira's business of managing buildings is run through
unified operation, that is, out of its central Arnheim and
Neely office where its management and supervisory personnel
and clerical pescnnel work»
Finally, these related activities must be engaged
in for & common business purpose *
that the requirement is met»

Again, we think it is clear

The emphasis of Congress was

on the word "business" to distinguish between business and
charitable»

Her® the activities at each of the nine

buildings are undertakers by Arnheim for its business purpose
of managing buildings and making a profit from that activity»
How, then, did the Court of Appeals reach a differen
conclusion.

It did so by completing ignoring Arnheim's

enterprise and by looking instead at Arnheim"s clients, the
building owners.

It found that the building owners did not

share common business purpose, that they had nine distinct
enterprises
This finding was absolutely correct.
quarrel with it whatsoever.

We have no

But it is irrelevant as applied

to this case, because it is Arnheim's enterprise in which we
contend that these individuals are employed.
There is a fact which is perhaps overlooked by the

13
Court of Appeals and by the respondents herein., which is
that under the Pair Labor Standards Act it is possible to be
employed in more than one enterprise at the same time»
that is exactly what appears to have happened here»

Indeed,

These

persons are employed in the building owners5 enterprise, which
is to own real estate.

They are employed in Arnheim and

Neely’s enterprise, which is to manage real estate.

They are

involved in both of those businesses.
Where they are employed by more than one enterprise,
if one of the enterprises comes within the coverage require­
ments of Section 3(s), then the employee is protected,
regardless of whether the other enterprise by which he may
also be employed comes within Section 3 (s) or not.
1 think the example that we gave in our reply brief
of the warehouses retaining the protective agency will
illustrate the fallacy of the reasoning of the Court of
Appeals»
Suppose you have nine separate warehouses , each
completely independent businesses having no connection with
one another.
watchmen.

They all require security services, night

They all retain the same protection agency.

And

the issue is, Are these night watchmen entitled to the
protection of the act?
Of course, if you look at the enterprises of the
warehouses in which they may be employed, their station, let

14
us say, at the same warehouse every night where they work,
you might say, "Well, the warehouse does not have an
enterprise that fits the statutory requirement.
they are not covered.

Therefore,

But# of course, they are also

employed in the protection agency3s enterprise, which is to
provide night watchmen at various warehouses and other
businesses around the city.
Q

Your typical protection agency contracts for

the services of the people it hires and pays them.

The

warehouseman is not necessarily responsible for their wages,
and the protection agency is generally primarily responsible.
MR. FREY:

No.

The structure of the act makes it

quite clear that coverage does not turn on who is
responsible for your wages.

The question is, Are you employed

in an enterprise which comes within the definition?
How could one say that these elevator operators are
not employed in Arnheim’s enterprise.

Arnheim's enterprise is

to operate buildings, and without the elevator operators
Arnheim could not conduct its business as managing these
buildings.

And, therefore, these men are employcsd in

Arnheim’s enterprise and it does not matter whose employees
they are.

It does not matter who pays them.
The red-cap cases which we cited in our brief are

an illustration of a situation in which the Court has held
that even though the railway company is not paying the red-caps

15
their salary.

They are totally dependent upon tips from the

passengers,, that it is not the payment of salary, who bears
the ultimate salary burden, that is the critical issue.

The

issue is who has control over the day“to-day conduct of these
employees.

Are they involved in the enterprise?
Q

Would you say a plant manager was himself an

employer because he has control over the day-to-day conduct
of the employees as well as the owner who hires the plant
manager?
MR. FREY:

One of the cases cited by the respondents

or perhaps by the amicus—I think it is the Royal Crown case—
involves a situation where the president of a company was
held personally liable under the act, because of the extent
of his involvement.
point.

But here I do not think that is the

The plant manager would not be considered to have an

enterprise.

We are talking about whose enterprise do these

people work in.

Are they working in an enterprise which is

covered under the act?
It would be possible that they could work in an
enterprise and the operator of that enterprise would not be
liable for their wages, and the example of that would be the
beauty salon operating as leasing space in a department store,,
The employees of that beauty salon, if the department store's
enterprise qualified under the act, the revenues of the
beauty salon would be included within the department store's

16
enterprise to determine whether it was subject to the act.
And the employees in the beauty salon would be entitled to
protection of the act even though the department store
exercised no control whatsoever over them.

The department

store might have no liability to pay them minimum wages.

The

beauty salon operator who does not have an enterprise with
$500,.000 would be liable to pay because these persons are
employed in an enterprise which meets the act * s requirements„
And this is a very important point that is overlooked in the
brief of the respondents and the amicus.
I was just getting to this point actually, and I
think perhaps I have adequately covered it.
let me say this.

So, in closing

St seems clear that the underpinnings of

the Third Circuit’s decision was a concern for the impact
of the minimum wage laws on the business of the building
owners.
It is of course an inevitable feature of such laws
that they raise the cost of certain goods and services and
thereby adversely affect the consumers of those goods and
services, many of whom rnay be small businesses.

This has

never in the past in any way discouraged Congress from
adopting and from expanding the coverage of the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
In any event, the concern of the Court of Appeals
for these building owners seems to us misplaced in this

17
instance.

It is by retaining a firm, such as Arabella and

Neely, to manage its buildings that the building owners
realize important benefits of an economic nature for them­
selves,

These benefits derive from the scale of Arnhsim’s

operation, from tha fact that it manages many buildings, that
it is able to hire, for instance, experienced top management
personnel, to manage office buildings which would not be
justified if only a single office building were being managed.
So that substantial benefits are being conferred upon the
building owners when they retain Arnheim.

And this notion

•that if they have to pay them minimum wages, they will all
stop retaining real estate management firms, is totally
without foundation in the record

and we believe contrary to

normal experience.
Q
for a moment.

Mr. Frey, let us go back to this bank account
The bank accounts are separate for each

building, you indicated.

Does the record show who is the

owner of that bank account?
MR. FREYz

I am not certain who is the owner.

believe that it is in Arnheim5s name.

I

I assume that it is a

trust at least.
Q

What goes into that bank account is the

property of the building owner, is it not?
MR. FREYx
Q

Yea, that is right.

And Arnheim, in whatever form that takes, is

18
holding it in trust and in agency.
MR. FREY;

That is right.

But that has nothing to

do with the statutory issue with which we are involved here.
Q

Perhaps not.

It is probably all bits and

pieces of these things that answer that question.
MR. FREY;

1 think that if you look at the structure

of the statute, it is quite clear that the question is, Are
they employed in an enterprise?

And in looking at Arnheim and

Neely, are their activities at each of these nine buildings
part of one single enterprise?
Q

What about the Workmen's Compensation liability,

where does that rest?
MR. FREY;

I asa not certain. Your Honor, where that

would rest.
Q

The stipulation makes reference to payment of

all insurance.
Justice was.

I was looking for the same thing the Chief
I do not see any express reference to Workmen’s

Compensation.

But there is here a reference to payment out

of those accounts of all insurance premiums, et cetera, for
each building.
MR. FREY;

I think that the question of the

Workmen’s Compensation law would be governed in part, by the
state law.

We are talking here about the Fair Labor Standards

Act, and the question is, What does that act mean?
Q

To determine what that act means, we have to

19
analyze a great many

elements, do we not; of the relationship.

You have analyzed some of them yourself.
MR. FREY:

I believe that it is possible to

totally ignore the relationship between the building owners
and Arnheim.

The relationship with which we are concerned is

between Arnheim and the business that Arnheim is conducting
and, secondly, between Arnheim and these personnel.
Q

You are drawing an analogy of someone like

Burns Detective .Agency that would furnish security service for
15 or 20 buildings or warehouses.
MR. FREY:

0

Yes, that is right.

Where Bums would hire them all, they would be

on the payroll cf Burns, they would be interchangeable.
Workman's Compensation would foe Burns.

The

The public liability,

which they undoubtedly would carry, since these men are
armed, that sort of thing.

Is that not quite a different

situation from this one?
MR. FREY:

1 do not mean to suggest that in the

Burns situation—I did not mean necessarily that the
protective agency would hire these people.
joint employers.

They could be

And I think it is very important that in

this case the agreement between Arnheim and the building
owner could be set up in such a way that Arnheim would not be
liable under the act.

Arnheim could simply get out of the

business of running these buildings with these personnel and

20
leave that to the building owner»

It could stick to

collection of rents and procurement of tenants in handling
the bank account for the buildingr let us say»

If it did

that, then these employees would no longer be employed in
Arnheim's enterprise,, and we would not be seeking to
establish Arnheim's liability»
By the same token, the building owners can get cut
of liability under the act by withdrawing any of their
employment control»

That is, they could leave it up to

Arnheim to pay whatever salary Arnheim wants and just
reimburse Arnheim on cost-plus basis for doing that»
In such a case, which would be a relatively minor
change in the existing agreement, the building owners would
be off the hook as far as liability for payment of minimum

images and for making sure that the necessary records are
kept and so on»

That would all be Arnheim's.

In this case,

they have chosen, to set up their relationship in a manner that
makes them both liable because these persons are employed in
both of their enterprises and they are both employers under
the definition of the act, which both courts below have held»
I think when we are talking about the policy that
informs and underlies the Pair Labor Standards Act, there are
numerous references in the legislative history of this policy,
and I want to refer to on© in the House report in connection
with the 1966 amendments to the act»

21
The committee said;

"In keeping with the broad

statutory definitions of the coverage phrases used;, the
courts have repeatedly expressed and adhered to the
principle that the coverage phrases should receive a liberal
intepretation consonant with the definitions, with the
purposes of the act, and with its character as remedial and
humanitarian legislation.

However, despit© the act's broad

coverage teras and the courts * liberal interpretations
regarding coverage and restrictive interpretations regarding
exemptions, there is great need for expanding the present
coverage of the act to large groups of workers whose earnings
today are unjustifiably and disproportionately low."
It is that policy and not any concern for small
businessmen that is the basic policy that underlies the
Labor Standards Act.

And given that policy, there is

Fair
no

reason to ignore or distort the clear statutory language for
the purpose of preventing these employees from obtaining the
benefits of the act.
If there are no further questions, 2 would like to
reserve the balances: of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well', Mr. Frey.

Mr. Strassburger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE B. STRASSBURGER, JR. ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. STRASSBURGER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

22
the Courts
I first would like to answer the Court's question
with respect to who owns the bank account involved in this
case»

On the bottom of page 23 of the stipulation it says

specifically that funds deposited in these accounts are the
property of the owner and not of Arnheim and Neely»

And

Arnheim and Neely is not liable, in the event of bankruptcy
or failure of the depositor»
There is no question, Your Honors, that these are
agency accounts and that Arnheim and Neely would not be liable
for any of the wages personally if these buildings could not
meet the payroll itself.
The history of this case started in 1965, at which
time one of the Labor Department representatives cams into
Arnheim and Nealy's quarters, examined the operation, decided
that Arnheim and Neely was an enterprise, and we have been on
the road ever since.
When we reached the litigation stage in 1967, we
knew that we were © guinea pig and that we were the first to
be hit with a suit by an agent which would have no ownership
in any of the buildings which it managed.
Because of the importance to the industry, the
Institute of Real Estate Management asked leave to intervene
as a party defendant and was given that permission.
We lost the first round in the federal court in

23

Pennsylvania.

Shortly after our case came down, a similar

case was started by the Federal Government in the District
Court of Virginia,

And despite the holding against us, the

District Court of Virginia decided in favor of the real
estate manager.

In that case, they made a threshold question

as to whether or not the measure should be gross receipts or
gross coramissions, and they held it should be gross
commissions, because the real estate manager did. not own any
of the gross receipts himself.
So, we went into the circuit court in the Third
Circuit feeling pretty good that at'"least 'we had one case in
our favor, namely, the Virginia case.
Q

That was the district court,

MR. STRASSBURGER:

That was the district court,

right.
Prior to the argument in the Third Circuit, the
Fourth Circuit got ahead of us and reversed the lower court in
Virginia.

So then the Government came into the argument and

said, ”We have got a pretty good case also»1"
Despite the Fourth Circuit case and the lower court
case in its own district, the Third Circuit decided that
Arnheim and Neely was not an enterprise,

A very well

reasoned opinion, concise, logical—I may be a little
prejudiced, but I still say it is that.
1 do not have to go into detail as to the nature of

24
Arnheiiu and Neely’s activities»
discussed»

It has already been

There are not any unusual types of activities.

The usual type of management activities.
But there is one point that I have to make clear
and emphasise.

Arnheim and Neely does not own any of the

buildings in which it manages.
present, that is all.

There is just no ownership

Every case of enterprise must have

some type of ownership going with it, and they do not have
any ownership here.
Q

Also in discussing—-

Is that really true?

You could have this

service organisation and clearly be an enterprise, could you
not?
MR. STRASSBURGER:

I am coming to that, Your Honor,

as to whether or not"-*
Q

It is not literally true that in order to be

an enterprise you have to own something.
MR. STRASSBURGER:
Honor.

I think almost it is. Your

I really think that in order to show an enterprise

that you have to show some ownership.
Q

Security guards.

MR. STRASSBURGER;
0

Sir?

How about the security guards?

MR. STARSSBURGER:

The security guards may or may

not be an enterprise, depending upon whom they work for.
Q

Do they have to own something?

25
MR. STR&SSBURGER:

Not the security guards, Your

Honor.
Q

What is the difference?

You said they had to

own something to be an enterprise.
MR. STRASSBURGER:

I ?nay have been misunderstood,

but I say that the enterprise doctrine itself must show some—
and I think I will be able to point it out to Your Honors a
little more clearly—that the enterprise doctrine must
contain some type of ownership in order to—
Q
what not.

They own paper and pencils and typewriters and
But you mean they have to own real estate?

MR. STRASSBURGER:

X am talking about title to the

receipts which they received, for example, the gross rentals
that they receive.

Well, let me continue and I think I will

be able to explain it.
This Court decided back in 1945 the case of Ten
East 40th Street Building v. Callus.

That case involved a

local building operation and because of that decision, the
Court held that the employees ware not within the interstate
commerce rule and it was simply a local operation.

We have

here nine separate buildings, all of which can be considered to
be Callus cases.
The Government says, "Well, since that case we have
gone into the enterprise doctrine, and therefore that case
does not hold water«"

26

Of course, the case is still being cited every day
for the proposition for which it stands, and the crux of the
real issue here is, Does the enterprise doctrine nullify the
holding of the Callus case?
So, we are back again to a definition situation as
to what is an enterprise»

And Mr, Justice Douglas and

Mr. Justice Stewart deplored the exercise in semantics in the
Maryland v» Wirtz case, but we are going to have to do a
little exercise in semantics nevertheless.
The definition states, "Related activities
performed either through unified operation or common control
by any parson or persons for a common business purpose."

The

word ”common" appears in this definition twice in three
lines.

So, X must assume that the word is rather important.

But let us take each of the definition words as it goes down.
First it says "related."
activities?

What are related

The Government wotild have us believe that they

are the internal activities of Arnheim and Neely which are
related.

Of course, any building

This is not what Congress

The related activities are those which

concern more than one business,, not just Arnheim and Neely
business but more than one business, with common ownership.
Lacking the common ownership, there can be no related
activities.

27
Unified operation or common control.

That could

only refer to those activities where there is more than one
business.

Naturally a single business has unified operation

and common control9 and not as the Government contends to a
single operation.
As a matter of fact, common control may not
be enough.

even

A recent case in the Tenth Circuit decided since

our case, called University Club

case,

involved a

situation where one corporation controlled both, an apartment
building and a hotel.

And the court said, "The business

purpose of a hotel is not the same as the business purpose
of an apartment building? therefore, no enterprise."
So, 1 submit to Your Honors, if a hotel and an
apartment building which are commonly owned and controlled
are not an enterpi-ise, how can there be an enterprise where
you have a number of unrelated buildings merely because they
have a common agent?
The use of the word "common," as 1 said before, is
a very important word.

When you talk about common, you talk
Even the definition of "common" in the

dictionary says, "Belonging to or equally shared by two or
more individuals."'
I know that Learned Hand once said, "We are not
going to make a fortress out of a dictionary," and I am not
saying that we should in this case.

Btit, nevertheless, this

28

Court, talking through Mr. Justice Vinson, once said, "We
have consistently refused to pervert the process of
interpretation by mechanically applying definitions in
unintended contexts."
"Refused to pervert "—those are strong words in
those days but they have a different connotation today and
I am not going to accuse the Government of any type of
perversion, but they certainly are distorting the words of
this definition of enterprise.

If I u3e my driveway with my wife and

family, have I created a common driveway?

Of course not.

But if I use my driveway with somebody on the other side who
has got a property on the other side, then I have created,
something in common.

The Government, however, says because

Arnheim and Neely is operating more than one building, it is
in common.

It is operating with itself.

.And I say that this

does not mean anything as far as definition of words is
concerned,
Nov? that I have taken the definition apart.
put it back together again.

What is an enterprise?

Let us
I think

an enterprise is demonstrated mainly by the so-called bank
and insurance cases.

A bank owns an office building.

It uses

part of the office building itself and it rents out to the
general public the balance of the building.
Prior to the institution of the enterprise doctrine,

29

the bank guard was subject to the act and the office building
guard who worked along side of him was not subject to the act.
And to correct that. Congress said that if you are an
enterprise, then this is where both people should be under
the sane act.

And I quite agree.

But that is not the

situation that we have.
In that case again, the ownership was the bank who
owned the office building.

And that, I say to Your Honors,

is what a true enterprise really is.
There was some discussion when the Honorable
Solicitor was talking about some of the economic realities of
the situation.

And this Court has said that when we are

dealing with social legislation such as this, we must look at
the economic realities.

What are the economic realities with

respect to the employees of these separate buildings?
In the first place, the employees go with the
building; they do not go with Arnheim and Neely.

are tired of the manager, they want a new manager? for one
reason or another the buildings are no longer managed by
Arnheim and. Neely.

The employees stay with the building.

They do not go with Arnheim and Neely.

The rates of pay, the fringe benefits, other wage and
salary matters, all are subject to the approval of the
owner, without exception.

But X think

there is enough in the stipulation itself to shew, especially
at the bottom of page 23, that the funds deposited in these

himself would have to stand all those---as a matter of actual
fact and in actual practice, X know of my own knowledge that
each account is kept separate.

And if the question of

Workmen's Compensation came up, it would be paid out of that
particular account and no other.

What about the stipulation at page 24 that

MR. STRASSBURGER;

They are paid out of the account;

Q

I suppose you would have public liability also?

MR. STRASSBORGER :
Q

Absolutely.

Do you- think it is clear from this record as a

whole that if an employee is injured on the job, he is
injured on the account of the building owner and not of
Arnheim?
MR. STRASSBURGERs

I think it is perfectly clear.

Your Honor, quite clear.
Q

If an elevator operator gets into a quarrel

with one passenger and there is a lawsuit, they sue Arnheim
in your view or the owner?
MR. STRASSBURGER:

They sue the owner..

There is

no question.
Q

He is the employee of the owner?

MR. STRASSBURGER;

That is correct, Your Honor.

Any economic loss suffered on the part of any of the
buildings is suffered by the owner and not by Arnheim and
Neely.

Arnheim and Neely is compensated through its

commissions.

And it would not make any difference to you

MR. STRASSBURGERs

If Arnheim's commissions

exceeded the statutory amount, you mean for coverage?
Arnheim and Neely’s real employees might foe covered, but
Arnheim and Neely has no™
Q

So, your answer is no, it would not make any

difference because these employees ara not Arnheim's
employees?
MR. STRASSBURGERs

That is correct.

The Government

equates who is an employer with coverage-, as opposed to
enforcement.

It is possible that Arnheim and Neely as an

34
employer because it has the right to hire and fire is
responsible for the enforcement of the actf the same as it
would be possible for Arnheim and Neely to be subject to the
zoning laws governing that particular building and also the
safety regulations of the building.
But to say that Arnheim and Neely is subject to the
enforcement provisions of the act is not the same as saying
that they are covered under the act.

I do not think that

they are the same thing, and that is what the Third Circuit
v

was saying when it said we are going to look at each
individual building, and that the vicarious responsibility,
as cited in the Third Circuit, is what they are referring to
there.
Q

Are you in a position to argue here that these

people were not employees of Arnheim?

The Court of Appeals

held that they ’were, did it not?
MR. STRASSBURGER:
Q

You mean, am X in a position—

And you did not petition for certiorari.

Court of Appeals simply held that they

The

were employees and

simply its order remanded the case to the district court for
the sole purpose of finding out whether each building’s
gross rentals during the relevant years exceeded the
statutory

exemption.
MR. STRASSBURGERs We are not asking the Court to

expand on that at all and, therefore, if we are not asking the

35
Court to expand on the order of the Third Circuit, I think
we have a right to argue anything which might be—
Q

Wo, that would expand on the order of the

Third Circuit because if they are not employees, there is no
point in remanding the case to find out anything.
MR. STRASSBURGER:

They can be employees,

if we

are not an employer, you are saying that there is no sense
in going on any further with the case.
Q

Correct.

And you are not in a position,

therefore, to make that argument because that would lead to
us revising the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

You are

We were satisfied with what the

We did not feel it was encumbent upon us

to file a cross petition in order to protect something which
may or may not be important after it gets back to the local
court.

After it gets back to the local court, the local

court can then again pick up the question of whether or not
we are an employer for purposes of coverage.
Q

Can it?

Has that not now been decided?

That

36
is the law of the case, is it not?

And you did not cross

petition for certiorari.
MR. STRASSBURGER:
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

Had you prevailed on the issue, would you not

be entitled to an outright reversal?
MR. STEASSBURGER:

That is correct, Your Honor»

But I submit that it is possible that if you take the
question of who is an employer with respect to coverage as
opposed to enforcement, that there might be a. difference,
and the Third Circuit does not make this distinction»

They

just said it was the employer.
Q

That is because the contrary finding would

have been dispositive of the case, a finding of no employer.
Can you not support the argument, the position of the Court of
Appeals, on any group up here?

You started to say something

about that.
MR. STRASSBURGERs

I submit, Your Honor, that the

most important part of the case is the enterprise doctrine,
and the Third Circuit said it cannot be an enterprise? it
would have to look at each individual building separately.
An anomaly would be created if Arnheim and Neely were to be
considered an enterprise.
Q

But the Chief Justice is suggesting that you

as a respondent are entitled to support the judgment of the
Court, of Appeals on any ground that will support the judgment,

37
evan if the point you are urging here is decided to the
contrary by the Court of Appeals,,
MR. STRASSBURGER:

That is essentially correct,

X

can understand the Chief Justice’s remark, but X thought he
wanted me to give other easons for sustaining the judgment,
Q

But the lack of an employee relationship would

not sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeals,
MR, STRASSBURGER:

X understand that., Your Honor,

yes,
Q

It would go further.

MR, STRASSBURGERs
right.

It would go further, that is

But X repeat we still do not know whether we are

talking about employer for coverage or employer for purposes
of enforcement.
The Third Circuit has pointed out the anomaly that
iss created if the Arnhelm and Neely business is considered an
enterprise.

It would foe anomalous, said the Court, to treat

the owners of commercial buildings as proprietors of
individual businesses when they managed the buildings them­
selves and as participating in a common business purpose with
other building owners merely because they hire a rental agent
who

manages other buildings.
Now, Your Honor’s, I can point this up with an

illustration from Arnheim and Neely’s own situation.

At the

time this suit was instituted, Arnheim and Neely managed a

38
building called University Square No* 1, a ten-story apartment
building*

Nesci to it is University Square No. 2, not managed

by Arnheim and Neely, a similar ten-story building,
separated, only by a putty wall.
If the Government's theory is correct, the janitor
in University Square No. 1 is covered by the act.

The

janitor in University Square No. 2 is not covered

by the

act.

This is a situation where the Government is creating

disparity between, employees' coverage, whereas the Congress
was trying to avoid this when they passed the enterprise
doctrine where two employees side by side were not covered
by the same act.

Now the Government comas in and says,

"We are going to cover some of these and not cover others/*
and the very question of the coverage of each of these
employees depends on who the management agent might be.
So, I say, Your Honors, that if Arnheim and Neely
is an agent, which it is, and if Arnheim and Neely manages
buildings, which it does, and if Arnheim and Neely manages
buildings which are all local in character, which they are,
how can the agent rise higher than its principal?
How can the Government do indirectly what it

cannot

do directly because of the Callus case?
Congress never intended such a result, Your Honors.
The law does not provide for it.

And the logic and reasoning

that is shown in the Third Circuit opinion should be sustained.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK L» SEAMANS, ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF THE ZNTERVENOR
MR. SEAMANSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please:
I think it is apparent why the Institute of Real
Estate Management is concerned about this case.

With your

permission, I will just make one brief argument concerning
the construction of the statute, and that is we do not believe
that Congress intended the result that the Government
position would achieve in this case.
We have been arguing about what is an enterprise
and what is an employer and what is an employee.

What we

believe, when the statute does not define itself and you apply
it to a set of facts, if you are convinced that Congress did
not intend that result, that that should bear on your
interpretation.

I base that on two premises.

It is my understanding that it is acknowledged
that Congress did not go as far as they might go under the
Interstate Commerce Act with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Something is held back.

And Congress itself adopted a monetary

limit, a financial limit, in its application.

So, I argue

40
that there is a congressional intent that there are still to
be some local buildings that do not have- to meat the minimum
wage, the overtime requirements.

It is purely economic.

I

argue that Congress intended that somebody is still left out.
Whether they should be or not, I suggest that that is what
Congress intended.
The consequence here is, in the opinion of the
clients that I represent—and there are soma 2500—pardon me,
these realtors in the- Institute represent seme 2500 small
office buildings and some 5000 small apartment buildings across
the country, and that is why the district court permitted the
intervention.
It is our concern that if this rule applies and a
building owner considers the employment of a rental agant,
he would ha well advised to ask that rental agent two
questions.
commerce'?

First, are you, Hr. Rental Agent, in interstate
Secondly, do you have any other client who is?

Because if the answer is yes to either of those questions,
then automatically I go in and automatically my elevator
operator, my maintenance people, are paid time and a half.
cannot afford it.

It will affect my maintenance—pardon me,

my financial operation.
This, ©s we see it, is coverage by association.
With whom do you associate yourself? K'ofcs who are you and
what do you do?

1

41
So, that is the position, if Your Honors please,
of the Institute, that we can get lost in a morass of
semantics and using manufactured words and statutory words
like "enterprise," "employer" and "employee," and we find
ourselves chasing our tails.
But if we are convinced that Congress never.intended
the result that this would achieve, we submit that that is the
place to find the answer to the pure construction of this
statute.

We .are quite convinced—and I think

if Your Honors

will reflect on it—the idea that you get coverage by
association and not by your own status or activity would
lead to the conclusion that however you do it, whether by an
interpretation of enterprise, whether by an interpretation of
employer, the achievement here of a result not. intended by
Congress should not be sustained.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Seamans.

Mr. Frey, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL, ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

First, with respect to Mr. Seamans'

comments, I think he misses a fundamental point.

It is not

the building owners that are subject to the act or covered by
the act? it is the employees that are covered by the act.
issue is, Are these employees in an enterprise?

Not:

Ar©

The

42
these building owners covered by the
Q

act?

I assumed his argument was directed to the

proposition of the small apartment owner who economically
could not meet these standards and why, by the very
exclusion of the small category by Congress, was not intended
to be covered.
MR. FREY’.

Congress intended that employees who

were employed in an enterprise, who were not employed in an
enterprise of a certain size, would not be covered—
Q

They might be alongside the large building

where the person doing the same work would be covered? is that
not true?
MR. FREY;

It is entirely possible that you could

have two buildings, one small and independently operated,
where the only enterprise is under $500,000, and one alongside
that is larger where the enterprise—-where either the oxfiee
building itself has enough revenues to come within the
act.
Q

So that all discrimination, all disparity,

could not be eliminated under the act.
MR. FREY;

Is that not true?

I think no matter how you structured it,

unless you just made it applicable across the board to all
employees, there would be some discrimination in that sense.
Q

Only Congress„

MR. FREY;

Unless Congress.

Yea, Congress.

43
Q

Is that not a practical matter of the

enforcement?

Is that at least one of the considerations?

MR. PREY:

I think that Congress felt that where

yon were dealing,, let us say, with the mom and pop grocery
store, that the impact on commerce was relatively limited
from such an enterprise and that Congress would give them a
break, these very small businesses»
Arnheim and Neely is not such a business.
not a mom and pop store.

This is

Of course, they keep trying to talk

about the building owners as though Arnheim and Neely had no
business.

For instance, they say an enterprise must have

ownership.

Well, there is ownership here.

Arnheim and

Neely own Arnheim and Neely, and it conducts the enterprise
of Arnheim and Neely.

That is the only sense in which

ownership is required.
Q

And it was held that these employees are their

employees.
MR. FREY:

And it was held that these are their

employees? that is correct.
Q

What about Mr. Seamans argument, as I understood

it, that if a real estate agent represented one office
building that would come within the interstate commerce
clause, and they had the representation of a hundred other
very small buildings, some of which were office buildings,
others were small apartments, none of which independently

44
perhaps would meet the standards of interstate commerce;
would you regard that that agent had a single enterprise
embracing the 101 people whom he represented?
MR. FREYs

We would not make any distinction on the

basis of whether any particular ones of the buildings that
were managed happened to meet the dollar limit.

What we would

say is* Is he conducting an enterprise?
For instance* the doctor-patient example used in
the respondent’s brief I think highlights this point
clearly.

They say* well* the patients each come to the doctor

and the patients are unrelated to one another.
are not engaging in related activities.

The patients

They have no common

health purpose when they come to the doctor.

Therefore*

how could you say that there would be an enterprise?
The doctor is engaged in a common business purpose.
He has an enterprise.
q

He is an agent* in the example I put; he is

engaged in a common enterprise.
MR. FREY:

I would look at the activities that he

undertakes and 1 would lesok to see whether they are related
activities* whether they are conducted through unified
operation and common control and whether they are conducted
for a common business purpose.

If I found all those things*

then I would say yes* he is an enterprise under the act*
regardless of whether the individual pieces of his business*

45
the individual customers of the grocery store or the
department store have any connection»
Q

That is what worries me.

Q

And the employees of these hundred very small

operations, say the part-time janitor, which might he the
only employee, would bo brought under the act in the example

1 have put.
MR. PREYs

Because under the act

they are not

merely the employee of these small businesses.
Q

I understand, but the answer to my question is

yes?
MR. FREYi
Q

Yes.

And they are paid not by the agent but by the

owner of this two-apartment building or this - four-office
office building?
MR. FREY:

Even if we were to agree arguendo that

Arnheim was not the employer, the act does not speak about
being employed by an enterprise but says being employed in' an
enterprise.

Arnheim has an enterprise.

I do not see how

anybody can deny Arnheim has a business, which is managing
office and apartment buildings for others.

I do not see how

anybody can deny that these persons are employed in Arnheim*s
business.
Q

Do you have to go this far as saying that if

Arnheim had the management of the management of the new World

46
Trade Market two buildings in New York and one mom and pop
grocery store—that is all—that the mem and pop grocery store
janitor would be covered?
MR. FREY:
Q

Do you have to go that far?

Ho, it would depend—

In case you do--I mean, do you not?-

MR. FREYs

No, you might find that these were not
The question would by,:

Is their

management of the.small grocery store a related activity to
their management of the World Trade Center.

And the point in

the legislative history Congress said—suppose you have a
•one company which is engaged in the retail apparel business
and also the lumbering business.

Congress said, “This is what

we mean by activities that are not related.

You would not

consider the revenues of the lumbering business in
determining the enterprise of the apparel business nor would
the lumbering business employees be covered.
This concept that you have to have more than one
owner, that the word "common" requires more than one, leads to
the result that General Motors is not covered under the act
because it is—
Q

What is the reason here--if you are going to

separate out Arnheim, which you do, as the enterprise, as the
separate company, and make it liable, which you are--what is
the reason for saying that the measure of coverage is the
total receipts of all the buildings, the total rentals of all

47
the buildings, rather than Arnheim5 s coramissions?
MR. FREYs

That we would submit, to begin with, is

clearly an issue that is not before this Court, because it
would have required a completely different kind of hearing on
remand from the kind that the Court of Appeals ordered»

But

to the extent that the Court wants to reach it, the situation
is no different.
Q

Can you not reach it?

Is the issue here or

not?
MR. FREY;
Q

We do not believe that the issue is here.

Again, no cross-petition,

MR. FREY;

There is no cross-petition.

In the

Mills v, Electric Auto Light case—
Q

Was it urged in the Court of Appeals by your

opponents that in any event the measure should be commissions

MR. FREYs
Q

Absolutely.

It was urged-—

And it was rejected by the Court of Appeals.

MR. FREY;

It was rejected bv the Court of Appeals

and it was rejected by the Fourth Circuit and—
Q

Why cannot, without a cross-petition, your

opponents urge that point here?
MR. FREY;

Because it does not support the judgment

below, which is a remand for a particular type of hearing.
Q

The judgment is on page 24 of your certiorari

petition , and it is a remand to introduce evidence regarding
each building's gross rentals.
Q

That is the reason it does not

The Court of Appeals decided against you?

MR. FREY;

No, the Court of Appeals decided in our

favor on this issue.
Q

On this issue, yes, but you

are the petitioner

here.
MR. FREYs

Well, the overall result was they decided

in our favor on two ox. the three issues they considered and
against us on the third.

The actual effect of that, putting

into practice, is that many of the employees for whom we
seek to obtain the benefits of the act would not get that
protection.
Q

None of them would in the Arnheim and Neely,

MR. FREY:

None of them--that would depend upon the

It is certainly

That is, if the building owners chose

to run their' own buildings and not have the benefit of
retaining an expert large real estate management company to
do it, then they would possibly not have to pay the minimum
wage, although the stipulation at page 21 indicates that one
of these buildings, the Clark Building, had $800,000 in
rentals in 1964.
Q

But it is an unusual situation, is it not,

where the basic employer is brought under the act only
because of his hiring a specified rental agent.
MR. FREY:
that comas up.

That is not the only context in which

That is the lease department example.

If 1

operate a beauty parlor, and I may have a very small
business, but if I want to go and put that beauty parlor in
Woodward £ Lothrop as part of the Woodward & Lothrop
Department store and lease space from them to do that, I then
have to pay my people the minimum wage, because they are then
employed in Woodward £ Lothrop“s enterprise.

That just is

the way Congress structured this act, and I think there is no
way to escape the clear provisions of the act.
Q

That is a much closer and much more intimate

associations! basis- than buildings spotted all around a
different city where they have no contact, with each other at

all as distinguished frora the beauty parlor operator who is
mingling constantly with the other employees regarded by the
public as the same kind of person»
MR. FREY:

Our case in no way depends on

establishing any relationship between the building owners.
When they go and hire Arnheim and Neely and Arnheim and Neely
go about and

hiras

John Doe to operate the elevator at the

building, subject to whatever approval or role the building
owner may play in setting his salary and so on, it is
Arnheim who he comes to, it is Arnheim who he submits his
reference to and checks them out? it is Arnheim with
he deals on a day-to-day basis.

whom

It is Arnheim who supervises

his work.
He is working in Arnheim's enterprise, and that is
what Congress said was determinative of whether he is entitled
to be paid ths minimum wage.
Q

When you say he is working in Arnheim5s

enterprise, that is what this case is all about; that is what
•we have to decide, is it not?
MR. FREY;

Perhaps so, but I think I am not just

bootstrapping myself, because I think that Arnheim's
enterprise is the management of these buildings, and they
cannot manage these buildings without these employees.
is for that reason that I say that these employees are
necessarily involved in Arnheim'a enterprise.

And it

Q

You have one fact

that the beauty parlor

situation does not have, and that is that Arnheim hires and
fires these employees themselves, whereas the.beauty parlor
operator, as I understood it, took a whole staff over that
sha had originally had.
MR. FREY;

Ho, what I am saying in the beauty parlor

example, Mr. Justice Blackman, is that the beauty parlor
operator may not have an enterprise, and Woodward £ Lothrop,
on the other handt may not be the employer of these people
who work in the beauty parlor at all»

And Woodward a Lothrop

may have no liability to pay the minimum wage.

But they are

protected by the minimum wage laws because they are in
Woodward £ Lothrop's enterprise, and the beauty parlor
operator, small business though he be, has to pay them the
minimum wage.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; -Thank you, gentlemen,
the case is submitted.
