MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-634, United States Civil Service Commission against
the National Association of Letter Carriers.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This case is here on a direct appeal from a decision
of a three-judge district court in the District of Columbia.
A majority of that court has held unconstitutional the basic
provision of the Hatch Act enacted by Congress nearly 34 years
ago, and held to be constitutional by this Court in its
decision in United States v. Mitchell, in 330 U„ S„, decided
in 1947.
The present form of the statute, as it now appears
in the United States Code, appears in the opening portion of
the government's main brief on pages 2 and 3.
In some ways I hesitate to put those pages before
the Court, because I think that the statute as if now appears
in the Code is somewhat misleading in the light of its
legislative history; and I will develop that legislative
history in my argument.
But in order to get the setting of the case, I
call attention to the statute as it now appears in the United

4
States Code, it forbids two sorts of activities in these
terms, and this is about the middle of page 2s
"An employee in an Executive agency or an
individual employed by the government of the District of Colum­
bia may nots
"(1)

use his official authority or influence for

the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of
an election? or
"(2)

take an active part in political management

or in political campaigns."
Now, it is the second which is primarily involved
in this case, and I would then call attention to further
provisions in the statute on page 3 — well, before X turn to
page 3, let me go ahead with the following portion on page 2,
immediately following what I just said:
"For the purpose of this subsection, the phrase 'an
active part in political management or in political campaigns*
means those acts of political management or political
campaigning which were prohibited on the part of employees
in the competitive service before July 19, 1940, by determina­
tions of the Civil service Commission under the rules prescribed
by the President."
The further portions of the statute on page 3
contain qualifications and limitations, such, for example, as
it does not apply to nonpartisan elections, and there are

5
provisions to the effect that an employee retains the right
to vote as he chooses and to express his opinion on political
subjects and candidates.
The plaintiffs in this case, in the court below, are
a federal employees' postal union, certain individual federal
employees who assert that they want to do various things or
have done certain things and fear prosecution, and local
Democratic and Republican committees.
The suit was brought as a class action, and sought
a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional and an injunction
against its enforcement.
This was granted by the district court, in an
opinion by Judge Gesell, with Circuit Judge MacKinnon dissenting.*
The majority accepted the appropriateness of the
governmental objective of the Hatch Act, but felt that the
statute was defective in the way it sought to reach this
objective.

In particular, the court focused on the portion of

the statute which referred to the determinations of the
Civil Service Commission made prior to the date that provision
was enacted; that is July 19th, 1940.
The court held that this definition required federail
employees to consider, as a guide to their political conduct,
tlie entire body of pre-1940 administrative rulings, which the
court said, and I quote, "were rigidly incorporated into the
Act. "

6

Now, we would suggest that that was a wooden and
indeed a perverse construction of the Act*

The Court felt that

these rules often proscribe constitutionally permissible
conduct and were inconsistent with each other and with language
in the Hatch Act itself»
The court further concluded that no constitutionally
acceptable mechanism was provided for reconciling the
inconsistencies, and it rejected the administrative
construction placed on the statute by the Commission's
decisions and regulations, holding that Congress conferred
no power on the Commission to clarify or define the statutory
prohibition.
On this basis, the court concluded that the statute
was both overly broad and impermissibly vague, with the
consequence that it had a chilling effect, thus bringing in
all three of the phrases which always come into these cases,
which was not permissible under the First Amendment.
The majority recognized that this Court had upheld
the statute in the Mitchell case.

It said, however, that the

Court had left open the question raised by the incorporationby-reference provision of the statute, and it held that the
Mitchell decision was, quote, "inconsistent with subsequent
decisions delineating First Amendment freedoms," close quote?
and these decisions, it said, coupled with changes in the size
and complexity of the public service, place Mitchell among

7
other decisions outmoded by passage of time.
Wow, Judge MacKinnon in dissent concluded that the
statutory reference to Civil Service Commission decisions did
not incorporate all pre-1940 decisions but only those not
inconsistent with the other provisions of the Act, and with
evolving concepts of First Amendment rights.

On this basis,

he concluded that the federal employee could ascertain, with
reasonable precision what sorts of activities are prohibited,
with the result that the statute is not impermissibly vague
in the constitutional sense.
The problems arising from political activities of
government employees have been a matter of concern since the
adoption of the constitution.

Brief summaries of this

historical background are found in the appendices to both
main briefs in this case.
In summary, experience has shown that there are at
least three types of problems in addition to the desire and
effort to have a merit system rather than a spoil system of
government employment.
Wow, first, the question of the employee's time, of
his using his working time to work for the government and not
for something else,

I don't think that that is really the

most important aspect of the statute.
Second, the problem of the development of political
machines through the use of government employees in political

3

campaigns.

TTe've had a great deal of history of that.
And finally, there is the question of the protection

of the employee against coercion and exploitation by his
governmental and political superiors.
Out of this background, the Civil Service Act was
passed in 1833, ninety years ago.

Within a few months after

the statute was passed, President Arthur promulgated the
original Civil Service Rules, of which the principal one
has ever since been known as Civil Service Rule I.
A few years later, Theodore Roosevelt became the
Civil Service Commissioner, an office which he held from 1883
to 1895.

And some ten years later, when he was President, he

issued Executive Order No. 642, in which the basic language
with which we are now concerned appears in an official
document having some legal force for the first time.
I may say that this language, which is quoted at the
bottom of page 14 and top of page 15 of our brief, had
appeared in a report of the Civil Service Commission in 1834,
when Theodore Roosevelt was the Commissioner, and when he
became President he put it into an Executive Order.
5,No person in the Executive Civil Service shall use
his official authority or influence for the purpose of inter»
faring with an election or affecting the result thereof.
Persons who, by the provisions of these rules are in the
competitive classified service, while retaining the right to

9

vote as they please and to express privately their opinions
on all political subjects, shall take no active part in
political management or in political campaigns»"
And that was been in effect, in one form or another,
under the Executive Order and later by Act of Congress, now
for two-thirds of the century»
Civil Service Rule I was immediately amended to
contain this language, and this continued in effect without
change until the Hatch Act was passed in 1939.
From .1886 until the enactment of the Hatch Act, the
Commission decided more than 2600 cases involving alleged
political activity in violation of Civil Service Rule X»
Thus, when the Hatch Act was enacted, Civil Service
Rule I had a well-defined and generally understood meaning,
although there were, of course, borderline situations where
there could be uncertainties.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume at that

point.
[Whereupon, at 12s00 o'clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o’clock, p.nu , of the
same day.3

10
AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.rru]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may resume.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - Resumed
MR. GRISWOLD:

I had been dealing with, very

concisely with the history under the Civil Service Act, for the
55 years preceding the enactment of the Hatch Act in 1939.
Prior to the enactment of the Hatch Act the
prohibition against political activity had applied to
persons in the competitive classified service.

What the Hatch

Act did was to extend these restrictions to all federal
employees, with a few exceptions.
Now, the Hatch Act, as congressional statutes go,
is a fairly short and simple one.

It is about two and a

half pages long in the statutes at large, it's title is "An
Act to prevent pernicious political activities."

And section

9(a) of the Act, as passed in 1939, and I think it is very
important to get in mind the chronological progression by
which the present statute developed, including the progression
within Congress by which the provisions got into the statute
as the various parts were enacted.
We customarily talk about "the" Hatch Act, as if it
was one thing? whereas there were two separate primary

11
enactments, one in 1939 and one in 1940, and there have been
amendments since.
How, Section 9(a) of the Hatch Act, enacted in
1939, and this is quoted below the middle of page 17 of our
brief, provided that "no officer or employee in the executive
branch of the Federal Government" — now, that's not limited
to the competitive service — "or any agency or department
thereof, shall take any active part in political management
or in political campaigns."
And the same section also made a further change in
the prior existing rule, in that it struck out the word
"privately" as it had appeared before then.
quoted at the top of page 18 of our brief.

And this is
It read, from the

time the Hatch Act was enacted, "All such persons shall retain
the right to vote as they may choose and to express their
opinions" — and it used to say "privately", but "privately”
is now taken out — "to express their opinions on all
political subjects."
When President Franklin Roosevelt signed the bill,
he suggested that it be extended to cover certain State and
local government employees.

And, as a result, in less than

a year, Congress took up amendments to the Hatch Act,

This

is a rather more extensive act, it’s some five pages long in
the statutes at large.

Much of it is given over to provisions

which made the Act applicable to State employees who were psiid

12
out of federal funds»

And in connection with that,, Senator

Hatch said in the Senate, and this is quoted on page 20 of
our brief, "In approaching that task we have tried to follow
as nearly as possible the exact language of the act we passed
last, year, which, in turn, was the exact language of the rule
of the Civil Service Commission which has been in effect
more than 50 years; and that language was originally chosen
because it had been in effect in this country so long and vzas
so thoroughly understood."
In other words, the objective was to avoid vagueness,
to project a provision which was thoroughly understood.
The bill as it was introduced, that is, this is the
bill for the 1940 Session, included a provision in Section 15
of the bill which authorized the Civil Service Commission
to make regules and regulations defining the phrase "active
part in political management or in political campaigns".
However, this encountered resistance, in substantial
part, I may say, from Senator Minton.

There was apparently

some fear that the Commission, by exercising rulemaking powers,
would extend the provisions of the statute.

And as a result

of this criticism, Senator Hatch submitted a substitute, and
this was eventually enacted.
This appears at the bottom of page 21 of our brief,
and I would like to read it because in many ways this is the
heart of this case

13

QUESTION?

Is the 1940 Act the one that extended

this to the States?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The 1939 Act did

not apply to the States; the 1940 Act extended it to the
States and also made some further amendments of which this
provision in Section 15 is one which is very important here,
QUESTION;

Would that Act, the 1940 amendment,

reach people primarily such as those working under the
Social Security Act, Unemployment Compensation, where there
are federal grants?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I think ~ I'm not

sure about Social Security, because I think they are federal
employees; but the Unemployment Insurance is State-administered
but federally financed, and it reached a sizable number of
State employees who were paid under federal appropriations or
federal grants„
QUESTION: But the welfare programs are under State
supervision generally, aren’t they, under Social Security —
MR, GRISWOLD:

Yes, but it's largely paid for out

of the federal money.
Nov/, Section 15, which was enacted in 1940, says:
"The provisions of this Act which prohibit persons
to whom such provisions apply from taking any active part in
political management or in political campaigns shall be deemed
to prohibit the same activities on the part of such persons as

14
the United States Civil Service Commission has heretofore
determined"

~~ and here are the crucial words? and,

incidentally, on the following line "of the passage of this
act" should have been in italics too — “heretofore determined
are at the time of the passage of this act prohibited on the
part of employees in the classified civil service of the
United States by the provisions of the civil~service rules
prohibiting such employees from taking any active part in
political management or in political campaigns,"
Nov/, this language is verbally different from what
is now found in the United States Code, and that I think has
led to misunderstanding and is a considerable part of the
explanation of the decision below.
I would point out that the respondents always quote
the Code language and never quote this language? whereas, my
argument is that this language, which Congress enacted in 1940,
is and remains the controlling language in determining what
Congress actually meant and how the statute should be
construed.
Now, the difference is simply that what Congress
enacted was "as the United States Civil Service Commission has
heretofore determined are at the time this section takes
effect prohibited", and what the editors of the United States

itWBunx»i«»uuia

r

Code, in 1966, and I believe that they are esteemabie
employees of the West Publishing Company in Chicago — in St,

15
Paul, they do a very fine job but they don't make the policy
determinations by Congress.
What Title 5 says, and as quoted on pages 2 and 3 of
our brief is that it means those acts of political management
or political campaigning which were prohibited on the part of
employees in the competitive service before July 19, 1940.
Now that means anything that was at any time prohibited,
whereas what Congress said was those things "which are now
prohibited" on the date of the enactment of the Act.
Now, there are two significant elements in the
legislative history in connection with the adoption of
Senator Hatch’s amendment.

You remember, his purpose was to

make it definite rather than giving an open-ended rulemaking
power to the Commission. Senator Hatch had prepared and
circulated and printed in the Congressional Record a card
which contained a concise summary of specific political
activities which the Commission then considered to violate
Civil Service Rule I.
X wish we had a copy of the card, but no one of
them seems to have survived, but it is printed in the
Congressional Record in about six inches of the Record.

In a

colloquy with Senator Brown, Senator Hatch agreed that the
Senate was writing into the statute the interpretation of the
Civil Service Commission, and shortly thereafter he clarified
this by saying that the interpretation of Rule I, which was

16

incorporated into the statute was, quote, "the interpretations
which appear on the card", close quote„
And following this discussion, Senator Hatch’s
version of Section 15 was passed.
Senator Hatch also introduced into the Congressional
Record a section of the Commission's then current Political
Activity pamphlet, entitled, Particular Types of Prohibited
Activities,

This is a portion of the item which appears in

the Appendix, beginning at page 89 and running through page
116, thus the material was available to the Senate when it
approved the entire bill.
House,

Section 15 was not disturbed by the

It then came before the Senate again on the conference

report, and was enacted without further change,
QUESTION;

Mr* Solicitor General, I gather front

your brief that in 1966 the codification substituted the
July 19th, 1949; that wasn’t done by. West, was it?
MR, GRISWOLD; The editing was done by West, Mr,
Justice,

It was passed by Congress, of course. But this has

been the history of these provisions.

They are enacted in

various parts and then finally they’re consolidated into a
provisional law which can be shown to be different from the
real, and then they’re finally enacted into positive law.
And 1 “** it’s off the record and I thought it was common
knowledge? I think the preface to the volume actually says so,
that the editorial work was done by the West Publishing Company,

17
QUESTION:

Isn't that done under —

MR. GRISWOLD:

Or Edward Thompson Company, which I

think is a subsidiary of West.
QUESTION: But isn't that done under a’contract?
They're employed by the Federal Government.
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

And they aren't working in independent

entity?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Chief Justice. They do it by

arrangement with the, I believe the Committee on the Judiciary
of the, of both houses of Congress.

It's — I'm not

suggesting anything inappropriate or ~
QUESTION:

For all practical purposes they're

federal employees while they're doing it, aren't they?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief Justice,

I —
QUESTION:

Under contract.

MR. GRISWOLD:

— I don't think so.

QUESTION: Well, I don't mean federal employees ~~
MR. GRISWOLD:

Even if they were, I don't think it

makes a great deal of difference. They are not members of the
House or Senate.
QUESTION: But, put it this way:

they're comparable

to staff members employed by the Congress.
MR. GRISWOLD: They are very closely comparable to

18

the staff members, no doubt about that.

And it was in 1966,

26 years after Section 15 was enacted, that the present fora of
the statute first appeared»
But in that connection I would like to call attention
to the Senate Committee Report at the time, and here again this
is standard in these provisions, this is at the bottom of page
26 of our brief,
"Like other recent codifications which have been
previously enacted into law and which will eventually result
in the enactment of all 50 titles of the United States Code,
there are no substantive changes made by this bill enacting
title 5 into law."
It’s perfectly plain that Congress did not contemplate,
when that was passed, that they changing the law.

Indeed,

if they were changing the law, it would mean, I think, that
Congress was then enacting into the law, by incorporation by
reference, provisions of the Civil Service Commission decisions
before 1939, before 1940, 26 years previous, which were in­
consistent with the law which Congress had passed

and there

seems to be no reason this Congress would have taken such
action.
Now, that's the legislative picture,
didn't legislate in a vacuum.

But Congress

Both prior and subsequent to

the passage of the Hatch Act, the Civil Service Commission has
carried out extensive administrative activities and has made

19

numerous publications.
In 1939 they published a pamphlet on Political
Activity, and it was a portion of that which Senator Hatch
placed in the Congressional Record.
subsequent editions.

There were several

In 1970 the Commission issued regulations,

acting under the Administrative Procedure Act, which
specified in detail particular activities which the Act permits
and which it prohibits.
These specifications are a summary of the agency's
interpretations of porhibited political activity contained in
the pamphlets.

They are set forth on pages 71 to 74 of the

Appendix to our brief.

They list 13 specific kinds of

activity in which an employee may engage and 13 types of
activity which are prohibited.
Congress has made no significant change in the Hatch
Act since its enactment.
In 1966 Congress established a Commission on
Political Activity of Government Personnel, and this committee
made a report in 1967, with a number of recommendations.
Several bills have been introduced in Congress, but none has
been enacted.

And these developments are summarized at the

close of the Appendix to our brief, on pages 76 to 78.
It should be noted that Congress has three times,
in the past ten years, extended the Hatch Act to new groups
of employees, most recently in 1971^ thus making it fairly

20

plain that Congress finds no problem with the general tenor
of the Hatch Act as it exists»
Now, as is well-known, this Court upheld the
constitutionality of the Hatch Act in the Mitchell case,
decided 26 years ago, involving federal employees, and in
Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commission, decided at the same time,
involving State employees»
In the opinion in the Mitchell case, the Court
referred specifically to the contention that the Hatch Act
violated the First and other Amendments on the ground that
its prohibition was so vague and indefinite as to prohibit
lawful activities as well as activities which are properly
made unlawful»

The Court refused to reach a facial attack

on the statute for vagueness, holding that the conduct in
question in the particular case before it was clearly
constitutionally sanctionable»
In other words, the Court chose to proceed on a
case-by-case basis.

We think that approach was sound, and

should be applied here.
Our contention is that the district court misconstrued
the Hatch Act in holding it unconstitutional.

We suggest that

it was erroneous to construe the statute as incorporating
willy-nilly all pre-1940 decisions of the Commission.
is done, then it may not be too hard to move on to the
positions of vagueness and overbreadth»

If this

21
But this is not really a fair or practical
construction of what Congress did and understood that it was
doing when it enacted the statute which it did enact in 1940,
The intent of Congress was to incorporate only
those rules that continued to represent viable interpretations
of the restriction as of 1940, and this is the way the
Commission has consistently administered the Act,
What the Congress did was to enact the common law
of political activity.
Here it is important to examine the exact language,
to which I've already made reference,"as the United States
Civil Service Commission has heretofore determined are at the
time this section takes effect prohibited,"

This, it seems

to me, we have numerous parallels in our laws, the Assimilative
Crimes Act incorporates criminal statutes of State, and that
would include necessarily all the State decisions which
construe those statutes and limits and modify or qualify or
even hold them unconstitutional under some provisionsj and
a variation vintage in our laws are the statutes universally
adopted to the effect that the law of this State consists of
the common law of England as of a certain date, as thereafter
modified.
Now, this means that no one, to this day, can be
sure what the rule is right here in the District of Columbia,
where the law of Maryland as it existed on a certain date has

22

been incorporated without going and using a lawyer's skills to
find out what that common law is»

He may be willing to take a

chance and say# Well, it’s all been changed since then and I
don't have to worry about it.
But this is not an unusual type of provision.
The decisions of the Commission were summarized on
the card which had been prepared by Senator Hatch? they were
also covered by the report which the Commission has put out,
and has continued to put out.

The statute, including the

1940 amendments, gave certain rights to employees which had
not previously been in effect.

Surely Congress did not, by

its incorporation provision, intend to enact into law any
previous rulings which were inconsistent with these new
provisions.
Finally, we suggest that the district court erred in
failing to give effect to the long continuing construction of
the statute by the Civil Service Commission.
The Commission has not only made decisions under the
Act, as it has been required to do in administering the Act,
thousands of them, but it has also continuously put out
pamphlets giving its interpretation of the Act, and finally,
in 1970, in a somewhat more formal way, it issued Regulations
which have been published in the Code of Federal Regulations.
The Civil Service Commission is constantly operating
in this area.

Any employee may obtain an advisory opinion

23

from the general counsel of the Civil Service Commission? by
publishing regulations giving its interpretation of the
statute,, the Commission has imposed standards on itself from
which it is not free to deviate in particular cases.

The

Commission has specifically listed common political
activities in which federal employees may engage.
No doubt there remains some uncertainties, but they
are confined to a relatively few, uncommon or borderline
situations.

And these arise out of the nature of the subject

matter.
Now, one of the areas where a problem has arisen
is with respect to Letters to the Editor,

The Commission

first ruled that Letters to the Editor violated the Act,
A district court in the District of Columbia overturned that,
or decided in favor of the claimant.

Our friends on the

other side cite this as a situation where the Commission has
not complied with the decisions of the Court,
My interpretation is to the contrary.

My

interpretation is that the Commission has sought very hard to
recognize that the writing of a Letter to the Editor does not
violate the Act, but that the writing of a Letter to the Editor
along with other activities or in such a way that it amounts
to a campaign does violate the Act.
Now, the places in between can be very close, but
the law is full of line-drawing problems.

24

We contend that the statute is neither vague nor
overbroad, and that in these circumstances the district court
erred in striking the statute down on its face.
Even if there is uncertainty in the Hatch Act in
some parts, it does not follow that the proper remedy is
facial invalidation, which results in wholesale elimination of
much that is clearly valid and necessary to the maintenance of
an impartial civil service.
If there are constitutionally objectionable aspects
to this statute, they may be eliminated without striking down
the entire statute in every application.
When the Hatch Act was passed in 1939, it included a
comprehensive separability clause, applicable not only to each
provision but to each application of the statute. And this
found its way into the United States Code.

But here again,

when Title 18 of the United States Code was enacted into
positive law in 1948, the separability provision was repealed
as unnecessary.
But the congressional intent reflected by the
original provisions should be respected.
And finally, we contend that the basic holding of
the Mitchell case, that Congress may constitutionally prohibit
active partisan campaigning by government employees should not
be reconsidered in this case.

The Mitchell case has become part

of the fabric of our constitutional law.

I think it can fairly

25

be said that it is — has proven itself by reason of the fact
that it has worked.
If there are matters of detail which were not
decided in the Mitchell case, if there are particular portions
of the Commission’s regulations or particular applications of
the prohibition which raise undecided questions, those
matters are best left to resolution on a case-by-case basis
in the context of specific alleged violations.
The Court should leave Congress some room to move
around, in this important and difficult area.
For these reasons, we submit that the judgment of
the district court should be reversed, and the complaint
dismissed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Matthews.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. MATTHEWS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.
MR, MATTHEWSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The real question in this case is the impact on
ordinary, intelligent government employees of a ban against
their active political management and campaigning.
All three judges below read Section 15 as incorpor­
ating all three thousand pre-1940 rulings.

And to that I would

cite for the majority page 4a of the Jurisdictional Statement,
and for the dissent page 38a of tire Jurisdictional Statement.

26

The judges below disagreed only as to whether so
read the statute was vague and overbroad.
As to the vagueness issue, we readily accept the
formulation in the government's reply brief that the question
is, quote, "whether individuals can with reasonable facility
inform themselves of the principles that regulate their
conduct”, end quote» That appears on pages 10 and 11 of the
government's reply brief.
The shifting positions taken by the Commission over
the nearly 35 years since passage of the Hatch Act under­
scored the immense difficulties of this task.

Indeed, we

find it highly significant that three days after congressional
passage of the Act in 1939, and before the Act was signed into
law, Senator Hatch wrote the Civil Service Commission and
asked what they thought the Act meant.
That appears in the Appendix to the government's
reply brief.
QUESTION: Would you agree, Mr, Matthews, that this
type of statutory exercise is filled with inherent difficulties,
the very problem is filled with difficulties?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Yes, Your Honor, it is a difficult

area in which to legislate, and a very delicate one, because
of the rightsto expression and association that are at stake
here.

I agree that it is a difficult area.

would foe easy to write a statute.

Not one that it

27

However, I think that there are alternatives to
this, which are readily available and readily looked at by the
Court.

I wouldn’t pick any one as being the right one, because

that is the legislative function.

But one was suggested in

1967 by the Commission on Political Activity of Government
Personnel.
Now, 35 years after the Act is passed, for the
first time in its reply brief the government tells us that
and they use the word "interface" — between the prohibition
that lies at the core of the constitutional problem here,
the prohibition against soliciting votes, quote — and I am
again quoting from the government's reply brief — "is perhaps
not as clear in some details as it would be, and the Commission
is presently attempting to draft clarifying amendments to the
regulation", end quote.

That comes from page 9 of the

government's reply brief.
When and how will we know what freedom of speech
and association the Hatch Act forbids?
Turning to the incorporated determination, the
government has filed with the Court ten copies of these
determinations.

These are they. They have also filed with

the Court ten copies of a 1971 work called Political Activity
Reporter? that Reporter did not contain a single pre-1940
decision.

That only has the post-840 decisions in it? the

pre-'40 decisions are in a separate three-volume set that has

28

been filed with the Court,
Now, the government, says that only those determinations which were effective on July 19, 1940, were what were
incorporated.

Yet there has been no mechanism for any

employee to determine which of these determinations were in
effect on July 19, 1940, and which were not.

The Commission,

prior to that time, never overruled a single determination.
Subsequent to that time, it has never systematically gone
through these determinations and said, This one is incorporated,
This one is not incorporated.
We have no way of telling which ones are and which
ones are not.
It is also highly significant that these determina­
tions were made under a prohibition that is in the identical
language of Section 9(a) of the Hatch Act.

These were

determinations made by the Civil Service Commission as to the
meaning of the term "take an active part in political
management or in political campaigns"»
And when the Congress then interpreted, incorporated
them by reference, they thought that they were defining and
made no distinction —* there is no distinction at all in the
legislative history of this Act as to which of these
determinations are incorporated and which ones are not.
The Solicitor General closed by saying that there
might be a few borderline situations where employees did not

29

know what they could do or what they could not do.

Yet these

borderline situatioxis again lie at the core of political
speech and association, the heart of the First Amendment
guarantees.
The Solicitor General tells you that the inter­
pretations of the Commission have been consistent, but he said
that, in fact, incorporated determinations were consistent
but only those that were viable were incorporated; he compared
it to the common law incorporation-"by-reference provision.
But the question comes back tos

How does the employee know?

If an employee were to read through these 3,000 incorporated
determinations, understand and memorize them all, he still
wouldn’t know what he could do and what he could not do.
One reason for that is that all of these incorporated
determinations are prohibitions. There’s not one ruling in
there that a certain activity is permissible; all they
published was when they took action against an employee.
Subsequent to 1940, in the Political Activity
Reporter, there are a few scattered cases of permissible
activity, but I have not found, in my study of the
incorporated determinations, a single instance of a permitted
activity.
The Solicitor General again used as an example one
that he used, and only as an example, writing a letter to a
newspaper on political subjects.

We say that this is a

30

constitutionally very significant activity,, and the Commission
says that it did follow Judge Youngdahl’s opinion in the
Wilson case, which is cited in our brief, to the effect that
the isolated writing of a signle letter to a newspaper urging
or soliciting votes is permitted*

Yet the Commission’s 1971

regulation prohibits soliciting of votes.
There is nothing in the permitted list that says
you can write a letter to a newspaper.

In the prohibited

list, it says that you cannot put an advertisement in a
newspaper.
And they have distinguished, as our brief points out,
in one dramatic case that we cite, the Massingham case, where
a man urged voters to vote for his father for sheriff, where
the Commission found that he had done it solely out of
admiring affection for his father and not as part of any
campaign.

And they distinguished Judge Youngdahl*s opinion

in the Wilson case, and they criticized it, because, they
said, it had not taken account of the incorporated determina”
tion.
There are other examples where the Commission has
acted, not only in borderline cases but in other cases without
going to the group activity concept which Judge Youngdahl, in
the Wilson case, said was king.
One very good example of this is in the matter of
Clarence L, Strong, which is found at Volume 1 of the Political

31

Activity Reporter, which has been filed with the Court, at
page 893.

This is a publication of 1971, in connection with

the attempt to tell people what is prohibited and what is not
prohibited.
In that opinion, the Commission held that the
respondent, a city carrier at the Littleton, New Hampshire,
post office, was charged with having participated in a
political demonstration in front of the local Democratic
Headquarters by carrying and displaying a large political
sign, reading, "LBJ for the USA".
Respondent contended in his answer to the charges
that he had never been active in politics, and that the
incident involving the political sign was prompted only by his
intent to annoy his wife who was a staunch Republican.
[Laughter.]
The Commission found that the respondent had
violated the Act.
QUESTION: Was that Littleton, New Hampshire?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Littleton, New Hampshire, Your Honor.

As to the legislative history of what was incorpor­
ated, we rely primarily on a colloquy with Senator Barkley,
who was the Majority Leader at that time, and a staunch
supporter of the bill.
At page 28 of our brief, we cite a colloquy between
Mr. Barkley and a strenuous opponent of the Act, Senator Brown,

32
Mr. Barkley said, "Mr. President, the Senator has
objected to section 15 in substance ■—"
Mr. Brown answered, "Strenuously."
Mr. Barkley said, "On the ground that we undertake
to write into law all the hundreds and thousands of interpreta'
tions of the Civil Service Commission on all the cases they
have had before them.

In order to meet his objection, as I

thought, I was suggesting that we do not write into the law
their interpretations but write into the law their rule,
which is almost identical with the rule which we set up in
the law itself."
The context of this colloquy was that very shortly
before it Senator Barkley had suggested that instead of the
present language of section 15 they define the prohibition
of section 9(a) by reference to the language of Civil Service
Rule I and the existing card of Senator Hatch.
Senator Barkley's suggestion was never formalized
into a motion,

Instead, section 15 was passed in the form

which he, a staunch supporter and Majority Leader, understood
to incorporate, quote, "all the hundreds and thousands of
interpretations of the Civil Service Commission on all the
cases they have had before them,"
Again, Senator Barkley had no way of distinguishing
between those hundreds of thousands of interpretations which
were viable on July 19, 1940, and those which were no longer

33

viable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Matthews, do you think that tlie

average working nan knows all the ramifications of what are
unfair labor practices, what is prohibited activity and that
sort of thing under the whole amalgam of labor legislation?
MR. MATTHEWS:

No, I don't, Your Honor,

I think,

though, that there there are — most of that activity, as I
understand it? and I am not expert in the field of labor law
t

— involve union activity, and you have ready-available guides
through the union.

We have a well-known body of precedent from

this Court, which is available to lawyers, and these determina­
tions, Your Honor, are — until this case, were never avail­
able to anyone.

They were produced in this case, in response

to an order of the district court to produce all of those
determinations which are incorporated.
That order did not ask the Commission to produce
determinations which were not incorporated.

That's the first

time that they have ever been available, outside of the
archives of the Civil Service Commission in Washington,
A second distinction I would make with the labor
cases is that here we are dealing with the core of political
speech, we are dealing with a sweeping prohibition on any
active political management and campaigning, that was enacted
by a Congress that I do not believe really knew what all these
determinations were, but where, in the labor field, they made

34

a calculated decision to the extent that there are infringements
of speech and association in labor law.
QUESTION: Well., are you suggesting that with the
ninety-year history of this, that has various statutes that
were considered, were enacted from time to time, that the
members through their committees and committee reports were
not familiar with the impact of the existing limitations?
HR. MATTHEWS: The only evidence on that, Your Honor,
is the Sheppard Committee report.

In 1°3G,. the Congress

appointed a Select Committee to investigate j^Lec*ion abuses
by government employees.

This committee was•chaired by

Senator Sheppard of Texas, and it engaged in investigations
all over the country and came out with a two-part report in
January of 1939, that was Senate Report IJo. 1 of the 84th
Congress [sic? 76th] and that report contained only three
mentions of voluntary partisan activity by government personnel.
And in each one of those three instances, it found it to be
above criticism.
It recommended the other prohibition on pernicious
political activity, which are contained in sections 1 through 8
and the first sentence of section 9 of the Hatch Act.

It made

no recommendation regarding any ban on voluntary partisan
activity by government personnel.
QUESTION:

On this point, the Solicitor General says

if you want opinions, you just write to the General Coiinsel of

35

the Civil Service Commission and you get an advisory opinion.
MR. MATTHEWS:
you the wrong one?

Yes, Your Honor, but what if he gives

Are you going to put your job at stake — if

he tells you you can't do it, and if he is wrong, the only way
that you could test that would be to violate his opinion and
go to court, at the risk of losing your job.
QUESTION:

Your whole argument is that nobody knows

what the Commission is thinking.

That's one way of finding

out, isn't it?
MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Nov/, this book here, you say is not

available?
MR. MATTHEWS:

These books, I assume now, I do not

know, that if you ask the Civil Service Commission, they might
give you a copy; although, in our case, we had to pay for the
copy.
QUESTION:

And what was it?

MR, MATTHEWS:

How much did you pay?

I think it was 10 or 15 cents a

page; I'm not quite sure, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Matthews, you say "these books", which

book are you referring to?
MR. MATTHEWS:

I tried to make that clear, Your

Honor. There are two sets, ten copies of which have been filed
with the Court.

One is a blue-bound Political Activity

Reporter, that contains within it post-1940 decisions of the

36

Commission.

They have also filed mimeographed ~ or I haven't

seen the condition they actually filed with the Court, a set of
the so-called Incorporated Determinations.
QUESTION;

How about the availability of this blue

book?
MR. MATTHEWS;
library; I don’t know.

I assume that’s available in any
I’ve never checked into its avail­

ability, but it’s published by the Government Printing Office,
and I assume it’s readily available.
The government also relies very heavily on a 1970
regulation, which contains 13 permitted activities and a list
of 13 prohibited activities.

And it says this is the

authoritative construction of the Act, look at the regulation
and you can find what’s prohibited and what’s permitted.
But if you look at that regulation, in the first
instance you find that the list of prohibited activity is
introduced by the clause, Minclude but are not limited to"?
and if you look at the list of permitted activity, it says
they're permitted "except as otherwise proiibitod by law".
So that these two listings return you again right to
the face of the statute.

Nobody can rely on those lists,

they do not purport to be exhaustive, they do not purport to
be all-inclusive? they are simply illustrations of certain
prohibited and permitted activity.
And as to one now, the soliciting of votes in support

37

of or in favor of the candidate, the government, for the first
time, in its reply brief, now concedes that this may be
confused and may bar people from expressing their opinion
publicly and privately on political subjects and candidates;
and they say they're rewriting the regulation now.
Thirty-five years is too long for this Court to sit
and let them find what form of political expression and
association shall be forbidden to millions of citizens of
this nation.
Turning from the void for vageuness argument —
QUESTION:

Is this, do you think, very, very

different from the strictures that are put on licensees under
the Federal Communications Act, for example?

or television station know in any absolute sense, in advance,

to be getting them into problems when they come up for
renewal?

defines that,

MR, MATTHEWS: The fairness doctrine, and I believe
there's one section, again of the Communications Act, that
relates to —
QUESTION: The length of time; the equal time pro-

But I would think that — and again I'm not that

familiar with all of the decisions of the Federal Communications
Commission — that a licensee could rest, fairly assured that
if he makes a good-faith effort to comply, that his license
will be renewed.

Perhaps I'm speaking out of turn, because I'm

not an expert in this field of law; and I really cannot
address myself well to your example.
QUESTION: But even the definition of the doctrine is
— leaves something to be desired in terms of absolute
clarity, doesn't it?

The fairness.

QUESTION:

Yes.

But —

They must be fair.

MR, MATTHEWS:

True.

administrative interpretation.

But there you have room for
Here, with the Hatch Act, the

Congress defined in Section 15 what was prohibited, it did
not leave that open to the Civil Service Commission.

Indeed,

it unequivocally withheld from the Commission rulemaking
authority.
Senator Hatch said, after two weeks of debate on the
original rulemaking version of Section 15, remember the
Solicitor General mentioned it, Senator Hatch first introduced
a version of Section 15 that would have conferred rulemaking
authority on the Civil Service Commission. After two weeks of

39

debate, he withdrew this in face of very strong opposition,
much of it based on the ground that it would be an
unconstitutional delegation of authority without sufficient
limits to the Commission.

It then enacted its own definition»

This definition is binding.

It is the determinations that

are binding, not the Commission's regulation which bind it,
"except as prohibited by lav/" or "include but are not limited
to" really returns the employee to this whole body of
incorporated determinations.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Matthews, I am not entirely clear as

to your position with respect to the validity of regulations
that are set forth on pages 4, 5, and 6 of your brief; they
are 5 C.F.R. 733.111 and 122.
Do you accept those as valid, or do you challenge
them?
MR, MATTHEWS s

We challenge them only as void for

vagueness and overbroad, as we challenge the statute. We do
not challenge directly, because it is unnecessary to the
decision in this case, the authority of the Civil Service
Commission to have issued these regulations, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Overbroad and vague.

MR. MATTHEWS:

Yes, Your Honor, because of the

"includes but are not limited to" language, because of the
overlaps, because of the permitted language which says, "except
as prohibited by law".

We say that these regulations do

40
nothing to cure the vagueness or overbreadth of the underlying
[Congress 3
statute; and well they couldn't, because the Commission withheld
rulemaking authority from the Commission.
These are simply, as I see it, a benign assurance
of a prosecutor.

It's his statement of his intent of future

prosecutory intent, and nothing more? and as long as the basic
statute is overbroad and void for vagueness, the regulations
must be.
QUESTION;

So that no regulation of the Commission,

under your view, would have the force and effect of law?
HR. MATTHEWS: That is right, because of the history
of Section 15, the Commission could do no more than say how
they intend to apply the statute.

It's powerless to do

/

anything more.

And I have not heard the ■— my brother argue

to the contrary.
QUESTION:

It has no rulemaking authority whatever?

MR. MATTHEWS:

It has no rulemaking authority whatever.

I think that is crystal-clear from the legislative history.
They wanted to give it to them.

Two weeks went by, Senator

Hatch said we’re not going to give it to them, we don’t give
them any more powers to interpret further in the future.
Those are the words of Senator Hatch? they're quoted
in our brief.
So that they have no rulemaking authority.

This

Congress defined the prohibition, they defined it by reference

41
to this mass of material, and they bound the Commission into
that.

The Commission has so stated.
I would like to •— the Commission’s own and

consistent view is best given, I think, in a book written
by a Commission Hearing Examiner in 1949, which is quoted at
page 25 of our brief.

I will not read it now, but I do invite

your attention to it.

lie talks about a "mandatory principle

of stare decisis".

He says that but for Section 15 there

would have been opportunity for logically reasoned conflicting
arguments as to what falls within the scope of the prohibition.
But no such leeway exists in face of the mandatory
Section 15.
QUESTION:

fir. Matthews, what if the Court

interpreted whatever it was that Congress sought to proscribe
the activity within the major product.

Suppose the Court said,

Well, what kind of example to not particularize all these
things on pages 4 and 5, but it was necessary to proscribe
the things on pages 5 and 6?
MR. MATTHEWS:

Your Honor, I think you would be

running right into the teeth of Section 15, because in Section
15 Congress said, We mean to proscribe everything that has
been proscribed heretofore.
QUESTION:

But let’s assume you read everything that

they intended to proscribe, and summarized it all like this.
Let’s just assume you did, whether you’re right or wrong,

42
would there be anything technically wrong with that?
It may be an erroneous reason of the past, but —
MR. MATTHEWS:

I think that it would be invading the

area left open to Congress.

I think that in order to do that,

you would have to be legislating rather than simply construing
what the Congress has enacted.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume the Court had looked

over everything that we think Congress was referring to, and
we are now issuing an interpretative ruling, we are just going
in and sweep up everything prior to 1940, and here's the way
we do it.
Now, maybe it isn't law, maybe it isn't a regulation,
but at least it would be the Commission's attempt to explain
what all these things meant.
MR. MATTHEWS:
QUESTION:

Well, I think —•

It may be wrong.

It might be overbroad just on its face.

HR. MATTHEWS;

Yes.

I think it might be overbroad

on its face, and I think that you overlook the principle that

Rockford, particularly footnote 5, where it says the Legis~

proscribed, and the Legislature must determine

Yes. But it is also able to change

one way today and another case another way tomorrow.

The

only authority that the employee, the average employee can
go to are the Incorporated Determinations, because that’s
what Congress said the Act meant.

And the Commission is bound

to follow out the will of the Congress.
QUESTION: Well, you're assuming that all cases that
might arise are fungible and that the Commission, on your
theory, would be denied making fine distinctions and drawing
fine lines?
MR. MATTHEWS:
Honor.

I don't believe I go that far, Your

I'm saying that if this is simply a guide to their

interpretation, it binds them to the extent that there is
something close or prototype there.

But until you know what's

there, you don't know what the fine distinction is going to
be.

You say, talk about the fine distinction, yes, I think

they can make that.

But in order to do it, the employee has

to knov/, if there hasn't been this fine distinction made,
he has to return to the basic source

46

He is thrown back again on the Incorporated
Determinations, because that was the way the Congress did it.
On the overbroad point, we’ve been discussing void
for vageuness, they obviously are interrelated, as Mr. Justice
Marshall saw last year in Grayned.

But the.real question on

overbreadth is whether or not there is a compelling governmental
interest that necessitates this deep and broad restriction on
the exercise of political speech and association by this
enormous and growing body of our citizens.
And we point out that the, both as to the legislative
history at the time the Act was passed, Congress did not
make the type of determination that more recent decisions of
this Court has required it to make today, when it legislates
in this delicate area.
Moreover, times have changed radically since 1939.
As the Commission itself has found.

And we consider it

highly significant that the Commission itself, in 1967, in
testimony before the Commission on Political Activity of
Government Personnel, said that the statute was uncertain,
it said that the statute was broad.
QUESTION; A committee of Congress said that?
MR. MATTHEWSs

No, the Civil Service Commission said

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. MATTHEWS: They said that in testimony before —

47
it’s printed at pages 48 and 49 of our brief*

I would like

to emphasize the key paragraph, which begins at the top of
page 49 of our brief.
”In essence, notwithstanding the present qualifying
provision, the present language is somewhat broad and somewhat
uncertain.

It is broad in the sense that it could be construed

to prohibit certain actities that may not be sxifficiently
detrimental to the neutrality, efficiency, or integrity of
the civil service as to justify the infringement of individual
political rights.

It is uncertain in that it fails to define

with clarity and precision the types of activities which are
prohibited.H
I say that that's the very test that the Court should
apply to the statute; the Commission is here saying that they
think, the Administrator thinks it fails those tests.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr, Matthews.
