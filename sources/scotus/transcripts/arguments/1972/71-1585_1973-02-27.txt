We will hear arguments now

in Ho. 71-1383, United States against Russell,
Mr. Lacovara, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LACOVARA:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case, United States against Russell, involves
a very important issue in the criminal justice system.
Basically, rather a new defense to criminal liability
is to be created that will focus exclusively on the nature of
the conduct of an investigative agent in uncovering and detecting
the criminal enterprise.
The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, from which
this case comes, has held that such a defense should be created.
The facts are basically simple and there are very few,
and probably no relevant controversies about the facts.
On December 7, 1969, an undercover agent for the
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, accompanied by an
informant, went to the home of the respondent, Richard Russell,
and there met with Mr, Russell and two other co-defendants in
this case, John Connolly and Patrick Connolly.
The agent, in his testimony

set forth, on page 4

of the Appendix, explained what happened when he went to

4
Mr, Russell’s horae»
1 £old Richard Russe11* and John and Pat Connolly
that I represented an organisation interested in controlling
the manufacture of methamphetamine,
drug involved here,

that is the dangerous

and that I represented the organisation in

the Northwest area, and 1 wanted to meet with the people who
were manufacturing the methamphetamine, arid I wanted to obtain
methamphetamine from them.
The agent later explained that the terms of his
business proposition to these people,whom he said he understood
to be manufacturing methamphetamine, wa3 that he would supply
one of the chemical ingredients in the manufacture of the drug,
*

Phenyl-2~Propanone, in return for half of the output, and he
would like to buy the rest of the output for cash.
Without any attempt to disabuse him of his under­
standing that they were currently manufacturing methamphetamine
or to express any reluctance whatsoever to the business proposi­
tion the undercover agent put, Patrick Connolly said, ,!We*ve
been manufacturing methamphetamine since at least May of 196S
and have manufactured about 3 pounds of it."
I might say,for purposes of illustration, that I have
been told by the Bureau of Narcotics that the average medically
recommended dose of methamphetamine is 5 milligrams, according
to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.
street, is 10 milligrams,,

The average illicit dose,on the

5
Which means that each gram of methamphetamine will
produce approximately 100 illicit doses»
Q

How many grams in a pound?
MR. LACOVARA:

Four hundred rand fifty-three grams in

a pound.
As we will see, Mr, Justice Stewart, the amount of
me thamphe tamine involved in this case would be enough for
approximately 3500 illicit doaes and, perhaps, 7,000 licit
doses.
Q

Is this the drug that's commonly known as "speed”?
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

Methamphetamine is "speed.”

It is a stimulant drug.

The prosecution in this case arises under the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act,

That Act has now been superseded by the

1970 Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act,
Speed remains a controlled drug under the new statute
as well.
The agent, however, insisted that lie would not provide
any of this important ingredient unless and until the three-man
partnership whom he confronted provided him with both a sample
of the methamphetamine they had already manufactured, and also
showed him the laboratory.
Patrick Connolly, then, with the agent, left
Mr. Russell*s house, brought the agent to his own home, where
he showed him some items of laboratory equipment.

6
Before they left Russell's house, John Connolly gave
the agent a sample which he said had come from the last batch
that had been manufactured.
I emphasise that at no time did Richard Russell, in
whose presence this all occurred, attempt to dissociate himself
from the enterprise.
Pursuant to the arrangement, the agent returned to
Russell's house the nest day, December 8th, but was told by
Russell that Russell and Patrick Connolly had been unable to
get the other chemicals necessary to manufacture the methoraphetamine because they had arrived too late at the chemical
supply store on the afternoon of the 8th.
The respondent's brief indicates that the record
shows that Russell and Patrick Connolly had tried to get
Phenyl-2-Propanone and it had been refused to them.
I believe the record, on pages 17 and 18, shows that
they were going to get the other chemicals and simply arrived
too late to get them.
In any event, they said they would get the chemicals
the following day, December 9th, and when the agent returned to
Mr. Russell's home, the home of the respondent, on the afternoon
of December 9th, waited for Mr* Russell and Mr, Connolly.
The group then set out for Patrick Connolly's home
where the laboratory was located, and after Patrick Connolly and
Richard Russell began the chemical process, by adding a variety

7

of other chemicals to a flask, the agent, then, upon their
request, provided them with a bottle of 100 grams of Phenyl-2Propanone.
The reaction process took about tv:a hours, according
to the agent*s testimony, from about 7:30 until 9:30.
After that, began the separate phase, the drying and
crystallisation phase, Ulrich v?as done on a hotplate with a
ladies home hairdryer.
At about 12;40, one-fourth of the mefchazaphe tamine
had been dried, that is after the beaker, or flask, had been
chemically treated.
Mr. Connolly poured the liquid into four separate
flasks and each flask was then dried on a pyrex baking dish,
separately.
So, at 12:40, the first transfer actually took place,
and that was approximately 10 grams, or enough for about 1,000
doses, illicit doses.
Agent Shapiro, the undercover agent, left the
Connolly home, left Mr. Connolly and Russell there, and un­
beknownst to them, secured the methamphetamine that he had been
given in his office in Seattle.
He returned the next morning at about 8:00 o*clock.
The respondent and Pat Connolly were still there drying the
rest of the speed.
After Russell succeeded in scraping off the remainder,

or the crystalline form of the drug,into three more bags of
me thamphe tamine, Patrick Connolly said to the agent, "You may
have the rest of the batch," and Russell, according to the
testimony, interjected, "After X get my half."
So the agent wars given one of the remaining three
bags.

Richard Russell, the respondent, took, the other two

bags.
The agent offered to buy the two bags for cash and
Russell said that he had already made arrangements to sell one
of those bags for cash,
Xn the course of the drive back to the respondent's
home, Russell agreed to sell the remaining bag, the fourth
bag, to the undercover agent for cash, and at his hone the
agent paid him $60 and purchased approximately 9% grams of
me thamphe tamine.
Q

Was it the same agent all the way through, Shapiro?
MR. LACOVARA:

Q

Same agent all the way through,

Only one government agent?
LACOVARA:

Only one agent involved in the actual

transaction, yes, sir.
About three weeks later, Agent Shapiro contacted
Patrick Connolly again at Connolly’s home which is where the
laboratory was located, asked him if he was still interested
in the business arrangetaenfc, and Connolly replied that he was
still interested but in the interim he had obtained two more

9
bott3.es of Phenyl-2-Propanone, which was the commodity the
agent was willing to supply,.and that he wouldn't he finished
with those for a few days.
A few days later, armed with a search warrant and an
arrest warrant, Agent Shapiro and other Federal agents raided
Mr, Connolly's home laboratory and seized over 3,00 items that
were admitted at the trial.

Included were chemical supply

company catalogs, a variety of chemicals, laboratory equipment,
and three bottles of Phenyl«-2-Propanone.

One

xms

the 100 gram

bottle that the agent had supplied and which he was able to
identify,

A second empty bottle was a 500 grata bottle, labeled

P-2-P, which chemical analyseis had shewed actually contained
the drug.

And, the third bottle, the 100-gram bottle, of P-2-P

was still half full,
Mr, Connolly was indicted on five counts involving
violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
Mr. Russell was charged with three violations:
manufacturing, processing and compounding, was one county
delivering the controlled drug at the time the first transfer
had taken place, and the third count, selling a controlled
drug, at

the

time that the agent purchased the final bag from

him.
Row, the defense at the trial was entrapment.
was the only defense.
Respondent, however, did not testify.

That

10

Patrick. Connolly did.

The jury found him guilty,

however, on all counts.
Mr* Connolly, in his testimony, admitted having told
the agent that they had manufactured at least three pounds of
speed before the agent appeared on the scene.

He also

acknowledged that he had told the agent that he, Patrick,
handled the chemical reaction phase of the business, that his
brother John normally did the drying and crystallisation phase,
and that Richard Russell, the respondent here, took care of
the sales in return for 50% of the profits*
The case was submitted to the jury under standard
entrapment instructions.
Q

Did Shapiro do anything when tills was being made,

other than to furnish it?
MR. LACOVARA:

Do I understand he did nothing else?

Ho, sir.

examination, what he had done.

He was asked, on cross-

He said he may have picked up

some pieces of aluminum foil, aluminum being one of the
ingredients, after they had fallen to the floor and put them
in the flask, but he said he did not provide any other assis­
tance, and tie did not advise or instruct the men how to go
about completing the reaction, or in any other way.

He did not

assist in the crystallization either.
So, his only participation — and I believe this is
agreed -- was to supply the 100 grams of Phenyl-2-Propanone*
The jury, under the standard entrapment instructions,

They are on page 17.

the Government’s proposed instructions.

They are the standard

Mathis and Devitt
Q

The first two paragraphs don’t say anything,

Mow,

this is the entrapment instruction And It is quite staple.
The defendants assert they were victims of entrapment as to the
crime charged —
Are you talking about those?
MR. LACOVARA:

Ho, the first three paragraphs,

beginning, "Where a person has no previous intent,„„ and,
"On the other hand, where a person already has the willingness
and the readiness to break the law, the mere fact that the
government agent provides what appears to be a favorable
opportunity is not entrapment."
q

Those are agreed-upon instructions by the parties?

12
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

The objection on the part of the defense at the
trial, as X read the record, anyway, is that the judge did not
sufficiently define that the Government had the burden of
showing propensity beyond a reasonable doubt.
Q

We don't seem to have that here in the Appendix, do

we ?

MR. LACOVARA:
Q

The objections?

Or any offered instructions, any -MR, LACOVARA:

in the record, however.

That's not on the Appendix,

It is

And the case as it comes to this

Court does not rest on the instructions.
Q

Well, except that they were erroneous, the Court of

Appeals held,
MR. LACOVARA:

No, no, sir.

The Court of Appeals held that the instructions
correctly stated the traditional law of entrapment,
Q

Yes.
MR. LACOVARA:

And, i'll come now to the holding of

the Court of Appeals.
Q

The Court of Appeals added another layer of

doctrine as an independent doctrine.
MR. LACOVARA:

Exactly.

The Court of Appeals -Q

Before you go on with that, may I ask you a factual

13
about a factual matter?

Do I understand correctly, from

what you said, that on the second day* or on the later day,
when the agent -- the undercover agent -- came back, he stood
by and witnessed the activity of making this drug from

in­

gredients which the respondent here had secured from an in­
dependent source?
HR* LACGVAM:
Q

Yes, sir.

And on that day, he was witnessing illegal activity

in which he had no participation of any kind?
MR. LACOVARA:

That's right.

I should also point out that the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act specifically provides that Federal and State agents
are not covered by the normal prohibitions against possession
or dispensing or even manufacturing controlled drugs.
nothing that the agent did was in any way illegal.

So,

And the

only thing he did was deliver one of the ingredients in the
manufacture of the drug,
Q

But that was in the first batch, not in the second

batch.
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, it was all manufactured from the

same ingredient.
As I say, the process took a series of hours.

He

arrived on the evening of the 9th and the chemical reaction
began at that time.
Shortly after midnight, 12:40 a,m„, on the 10th, he

14

got the first quarter of the batch, which had been dr5,ed, and
he left and brought that to his office.
He came back the following morning and Russell and
Pat Connolly were still working on the remainder of the
methamphetamine, and at that point the agent was given a
second bag and purchased the third bag.

And the record shows

that the respondent wound up with the fourth bag.
Q

But some of this was made from this one essential

ingredient which the respondent bad obtained on his own from
some other source?
MR, LACOVAM;

Well, no, there was delivered to the

agent before he provided them with any Pheny1-2-Propsnone, a
sample which one of the partnership said had come from the last
batch they had manufactured.
Then, after the batch had been manufactured with the
ingredient that the agent supplied, the agent returned to
Connolly’s home about three or four weeks later to renew the
business arrangement and was told that they had since come upon
a new source of Phenyl-2-Propanone and didn’t need any of his
at that time.
But all of the methamphetamine involved in this
prosecution comes from a chemical reaction which included the
Phenyl-2-Propanone that the agent provided.
That’s the posture in which the case is before the
Court.

15
Q

As I understand this respondent, Richard Russell,

was indicted under three counts only, all having to do with
activities on December 10, 1969.
MR. LACOVARA:
Q

That’s right.

And that^ concededly, those activities all had to do

with the batch, so-called, that was manufactured from the
chemical provided by Mr, Shapiro,
MR. LACOVARA:

Thatfs right,

Ho question about that.

The evidence of the subsequent availability of
Phenyl-2-Propanone was admitted at Che trial because it showed,
among other things, the availability of this ingredient from
other sources.
It was received without objection, I believe,
Q

Mr, Lacovara, did the respondent tender any instruction

in the District Court on the factual Issue of whether or not
this Phenyl-2-Propanone was or was not available from sources
other than the Government agent?
MR. LACOVARA:

Ho, sir.

Tha basic argument in the instructions was over who
had the burden of proving propensity or lack of propensity to
commit the crime.
After the trial, in a memorandum for a new trial,
the respondent’s counsel argued as a matter of law that the
delivery of an ingredient in the manufacture of the mefchamphetamine constituted entrapment as a matter of law.

16
That was the position ultimately upheld by the
9th Circuit in thi3 case.
So the case comes to this Court, Mr. Justice Stewart,
on a holding as a matter of law, on what are essentially un­
disputed facts;
The 9th Circuit saying that the standard entrapment
standards would not be met in this case because Mr, Russell’s
predisposition amply shown by the record had been virtually
conceded, and in the opinion which is set forth in the
Appendix to the petition the dissenting judge, Judge Trask,
actually quotes the portion of respondent’s brief in the
Court of Appeals conceding that the jury could find under the
standard entrapment defense that he was predisposed to the
offense.
Q

Judge Healey’s opinion for the majority of the

Court of Appeals sets out by talking about two theories of
law and then ends up by saying we are not going to give a
label to it and, in any event, we are reversing ~MR* LACGVARA:

His two theories, in a nutshell, are

these.
First of all, he focuses, generally, on some of the
statements made in the separate opinions of the minority in
the Sorrells and Sherman cases which are, of course, the two
leading 'entrapment cases.
In those opinions, Justices Roberts and Frankfurter

17
said that the entrapment defense really ought to focus not on
the subjective guilt or innocence of the defendant, or on its
predisposition to commit the crime, but, rather, ought to focus
only on the nature of the officer's conduct.

And if that

conduct is intolerable then there ought to be a bar to the
prosecution.
I will show in a few moments that that rationale is
not applicable to this kind of case anyway,
But, the 9th Circuit said, under one of two theories,
the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to dismissal of
the indictment.
First, they said it is intolerable government conduct
to supply contraband to a defendant and then prosecute him for
possession of the contraband.
The court said, by some process of extension, that
even though the Phenyl- 2 -Propanone was not contraband, is not
and was not a regulated chemical, nevertheless, without the
delivery of that the contraband couldn't have been made, and,
therefore, what happened here was intolerable.
That, the court said, was a kind of extension of the
traditional entrapment doctrine.
Alterratively, the 9th Circuit, Judge Eli's opinion,
said there is a separate kind of due process defense that ought
to be recognized where the Government engages in too much of
the continuing criminal enterprise.

When the Government .

18
becomes enmeshed in the enterprise for reasons similar to the
reasons that support the entrapment defense, the Government
ought to be precluded from prosecuting.
Here, the court said, because the undercover agent
had supplied one of the ingredients and had been present during
the manufacture, that precluded the Government from prosecuting,
Q

The latter theory was a constitutional theory and

the first theory was a non-constitutional theory,
MR. LACOVAM:
Q

Yes,

Because entrapment ~~ there is nothing about

entrapment so far, either in Sorrells or Sherman,in either the
Court opinion or the concurring opinion, that was based on the
Constitution,
MR, LACOVARA:

That’s right.

I’d like to approach now Sorrells and Sherman to say
why, under either of the views presented in those cases, the
indictment in this case ought to be reinstated.
Both parties to the case have rather extensively
quoted from all of the opinions in those two cases, and I won’t
take the time of the Court to read extensively from them
except to say that the difference in philosophy is basic.
Chief Justice Hughes’ opinion in Sorrells and Chief
Justice Warren’s opinion in Sherman say basically what we are
talking about is a defense to criminal liability.
The basic issue, in terms of normal criminal law

19
standards of culpability is: did the intent which with the
defendant did the physical acts that are in apparent violation
of the statute arise on his own or was that criminal design
manufactured by the Government?
In an analogy to standard insanity or duress or
mistake concepts, the man is just not criminally liable or
culpable if the Government manufactured the criminal intent,.
And the Court in both of those cases said this is
consistent with what we would understand the Congressional
intent to be.
And, both Chief Justices said Congress didn*t want
its criminal statutes enforced against people who did not
intend to violate them until the Government came along.
The separate opinions of Justice Roberts and Justice
Frankfurter put a wholly different cast on it and said the
focus ought to be on whether the conduct of the investigators
is tolerable or not, irrespective of normal guilt or innocence
under criminal law principles.
But, even those separate opinions — and this is
basic — state what is called the objective test rather than
the subjective test, and it is not the kind of visceral, or
subjective, test that the Court of Appeals applied here, terming
the conduct intolerable, repugnant or excessive or over-sealous*
The standard stated by Justice Frankfurter, and we
quote the language on page 19 of our main brief, is this:

20
"This test,” ho says, ’.'shifts attention from the record and
predisposition of the particular defendant to the conduct of
the police and the likelihood, objectively considered, that it
would entrap only those ready and willing to commit the crime.'
This has been proposed in the Hodel Penal Code and
the proposed Federal Code and the introduction Senate 1,in the
93rd Congress, which is the official Senate bill, McClellan's
— Senator McClellan's bill revamping the whole Federal
Criminal Code,
The test would be an objective one.

Is it likely

that the conduct that the agent engaged in might seduce an
innocent person into committing a crime?
If it is that kind of conduct, we don't care, under
this test, whether the defendant actually had a criminal
design,

We just won't allow the Government to engage in that

kind of conduct.
If, however, it is conduct that would not likely
ensnare the innocent as well a3 the guilty, looking only at
the agent's conduct, then there is to be no defense.
That’s the objective standard.
Mow, in this case, of course, applying that standard,
there can be no question but that, objectively considered,
an offer to someone to supply an Ingredient in the manufacture
of an illegal drug is not lively to tempt or to seduce the
ordinary law-abiding citisen about whom Justice Frankfurter

21
was speaking as well, into committing the crime.
These statements by Justice Roberts and Justice
Frankfurter came up in the context of cases where it might be
thought that a normal, law-abiding citisen might have fallen
from grace because of the overbearing of the Government agent.
In Sorrells, it was a request to get some liquor,
during Prohibition,for an old Army buddy, and it aright have
been thought that normal social behavior might ultimately
cause a person

a normally law-abiding person -- to yield

and supply a pint of liquor.
Xn Sherman, of course, the undercover informant
tempted another former narcotics addict who was undergoing
treatment with him to get him heroin for his personal use,
saying that he couldn’t suffer the pain of withdrawal, and
finally, the prospective defendant yielded.
Those are poles apart from the kind of conduct here
which presents no risk in the Frankfurter formulation or the
formulation of the Model Penal Code, the proposed Federal
Code or S-l, create no risk that the Government conduct will
ensnare the otherwise innocent or tempt the normally lawabiding citisen, as in the proposed Federal Code.
Q

It is a littlo hard to square the language in

Sorrells, either the Court's language or the concurring
opinion’s language, with the facts in Sorrells that I, frankly,
had never known until I read the American Civil Liberties Union

22
Amicus brief In this case.

Sorrells was a professional boot­

legger, apparently, wasn’t he?
MR. LACQVABA:

There was some indication in the

record that he was a rum-runnerc But all the Court held in
Sorrells was that if the jury had credited the defense testi­
mony, which was that he didn’t deal in liquor, and had a good
reputation in the community, they might have entertained a
reasonable doubt, which is the current standard, about whether
he had the predisposition.
So, in Sorrells, all that happened was the case was
sent back for a new trial because the trial court had held
that it would not even submit the entrapment question to the
jury.
All the Court held was that,under one view of the
evidence, there might have been entrapment.

The theory is what we are concerned about here,

Everything Hughes said was prefaced by the -- and

if — it was either -MR. LACOVARA:

Right,.

He said, and we quote this

language, "The record in this case would permit the jury to
infer that the man was otherwise industrious,”

That's the

language you are referring to, but he wasn't taking that as
proven.

He have raised in our brief the question of whether
the creation of this new kind of defense is even an appropriate
exercise of judicial power, because, to the best of our
knowledge, neither under the Due Process Clause nor under what
is called the Court’s supervisory power over the administration
of criminal justice, has the Court over asserted or exercised
the power to create a new defense to criminal liability,;
Chief Justice Hughes, In the Sorrells opinion,
specifically rejects this proposition, saying the courts have
no power once a valid statute, applicable

according to its

construction, is involved and the Executive chooses to prose­
cute „ Courts have no power to create a new defense to exonerate
the defendant, which would be the effect of the holding in this
case.
He have argued at some length in our brief that
whether you regard this as an extension of the entrapment case
or as a proposal to establish a new due process defense, there

is no basis for doing it.

24
First of all, the technique here, giving one of the
ingredients to he used in the manufacture of the drug, fits
■within the traditional law enforcement technique which has
been reaffirmed by this Court as recently as in Osborne v.
United States, in 385 U»S., and that is it is not unlawful
entrapment to provide the opportunity or facility for commis­
sion of a crime if the criminal intent, which is the underlying
premise of criminal prosecution, inheres in the defendant
before the agent appears on the scene.
Similarly, there is no inherent unfairness here in
this kind of activity, we believe.

X think we have shown in

our brief that there are countervailing reasons, from law
enforcement purposes, for infiltrating criminal groups, not
only drug groups, but organised crime, smuggling and espionage
groups,

............
But nothing that was done hare violated any

specific provision of the Constitution.
The Court in Hoffa, Osborne and Lewis has specifically
rejected Fourth, Fifth and Sixth .Amendment challenges to under­
cover operations.

And, in Hoffa specifically rejected the

notion that this violates Fifth Amendment due process as
inherently unfair.
We, therefore, request that the judgment below should
be reversed and the indictment reinstated.
Q

Mr. Lacovara, how much of a concession do you mean to

25

be making in your briefs on page 32, where you say that, "It

„

may be 'chat due process precludes criminal conviction for
engaging in conduct that would not have been possible without
the participation and assistance of a government agent who
supplied an indispensable means to the commission of the crime
that could not have been obtained otherwise, through legal or
illegal channels.”
MR, LACOVARA:

Yes.

That's what X would call a

minimal concession, Mr. Justice.
What we are talking about there is if the only
thing that translated a fantasy into a crime is the appearance
of the government agent, well then it might be said that there
couldn't have beer» a crime but for the government agent.
For example, If some people at a college smoker
decided they would like to loot Fort Knox and there was an
undercover agent present and he stimulated the scheme and
because of his official position got the keys to the vault and
had all the guards taken away and had the searchlights turned
off and the men walked in -- what I -Q

I suppose if a government agent and his friend were

together and the friend said, "Gee, if I had a gun I'd kill
that man,” and the agent handed him a gun and said, ,5Here, go
ahead,” that would be an example of your concession, wouldn5t
It?

MR. LACOVARAi

There are practical constraints on the

26
occasions in which undercover agents become involved in
schemes.

They don't apply to violent crimes.
Even the proposed formulations would not allow

even an entrapment defense where bodily injury is threatened.
To illustrate, Mr. Justice, if I may, what X would
call our basic theory is that if the Government provides a
fungible commodity there is no entrapment as a matter of law.
That would be Phenyl-2-Propanone here because it
could be obtained from other sources.

It was difficult to

obtain.
It would even apply to heroin or to counterfeit
bills because if the agent ign’t there inf initiating the
scheme, monitoring it by his presence and participation,it
is very probable, under the realities of the criminal worlds
that the heroin or the counterfeit bills or the P-2-P, in this
case, or the gun in your case, would have come from someone
else. And it is legitimate law enforcement objective to stay
right close to the transaction, including cooperating with the
scheme bo the extent necessary, in order to track it all the
way to the conclusion ,to find out all the participants and then
nip it before it goes any further.
Q

In this case, on the second occasion, he had gotten

the material some place else.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, sir.

Patrick Connolly had, apparently, 600-gram jar© of

27
P-2-P
Thank, yon,

Mr. Brucker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. S, BRUCKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BRUCKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and »say it please

the Court:
I would like to address myself briefly, if I might,
as to what I think this case is all about.
I would then like to emphasise some matters in the
factual aspects of this case which I feel are very important.
And then, I would like to proceed on to what I feel
is the law — the applicable law — that should be applied in
this case.
I think what this case is all about, first of all,
can be summarised in the phrase "entrapment as a matter of law,"
And the analysis must focus on what law?

What are we talking

about ?
Many courts use that phrase, and I think it is going
to be helpful to us if this Court will tell us what law we
are talking about.
Now, we have suggested in our brief three possible
laws which this Court can use.
First of all, is the Due Process Clause.
Now, this would come from statements that were

28
contained in Sorrells, Sherman and Raley_ v.,, Ohio.
Q

Xn the majority, or dissenting or —
MR. BRUCKSR:

In the majority opinion.

The majority

opinion in Sorrells, we have quoted in our brief, Mr. Justice
Roberta makes a suggestion that it has been -- excuse me,
Mr. Justice Hughes makes a suggestion that it has been -- the
activities of the law enforcement officer are such that due
process considerations apply.
Mr. Chief Justice Warren clearly makes that state­
ment in the Sherman case, where he says that when the in­
tolerable activities then become so bad that they rise to the
level of due process considerations, just as the- Fourth
Amendment search and seizure or the Fifth Amendment coerced
confession,
Q

Would you suggest there is nothing new in the Court

of Appeals approach to this problem here?
MR. BRUCKER:
in the Court of Appeals.

I am suggesting there is nothing new
That is correct, Your Honor.

What I am saying,in this case, that this is the way
that courts have analyzed these cases but they have not really
articulated the basic problem that they are talking about, and
that is the reaction to over-zealous law enforcement activities.
This type of case has been considered by the courts
of the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit,
three District Courts, the highest courts of the State of

29

Illinois3 of Arizona, the Appellate Court of New Mexico, and
they have all agreed with our view, I believe.
That’s why I am saying there is nothing new*
This is the articulation.

This is what we arc

talking about: entrapment as a matter of law.
Q

What law?

Is the entrapment concept, as applied by this Court,

applicable to State convictions?
T

MR, BRUCKGR:

Ho*

v

But most of the States -- to my

knowledge, all the States -Q

Oh, yes, but your answer is that so far the

entrapment defense has not been constitutionalised so as to
be applicable to the States.
MR* BRUCKER:
Q

That is correct.

So there is something new in the Ninth Circuit

approach, because its approach would be applicable to the
States on a habeas —
MR. BRUCKER:

Weil, not necessarily.

Yes, in the

future, it certainly would be, yes, but not as far as
opening.
As the Government says in its reply brief, about
opening up the gates —
Q

Well, no, but it would be applicable —
MR, BRUCKER:

That is correct.

That's right.

Because what I am saying here is the Government has
gone far further

30
Q

But the entrapment, the trans—

—

however it’s been spoken about in our past cases,

has not been constitutionalized to the extent that it is
applicable

to the States.
BRUCKER:

That is correct. But there is one

suggestion, of course, in Hr. Justice Frankfurter's separate
opinion in Sherman, where he does suggest an Equal Protection
argument, where there was treating classes of individuals
differently whether or not they have predisposition.
questioned whether that was equal protection.

He

But, certainly,

the holdings have not risen to that level.
Q

By the same token, Congress could repeal the

entrapment defense.

They could provide,with respect to any

particular criminal statute, that there should be no entrapment
defense allowed,

if that’s a charge under this statute,

couldn’t it?
mi. BRUCKER:
Q

Under the existing law.
HR, BRUCKER:

Q

Yes, it could.

Yes.

It couldn’t do away with the defense as, whatever

the defense is, as envisaged by the 9th Circuit?
HR, BRUCKER:
Q

That is correct.

To the extent that it depends upon due process.
HR, BRUCKER:

Yes.

It could do certainly

What I am suggesting is that this is for purposes of

31
analysis, that this is really what we are talking about,
because the level of Government activity has gone too far.
Q

What particular act went too far in this case?
MR. BRUCKER:

q

Which he could have obtained any place else.
MR. BRUCKER:

Q

Wo, Your Honor, absolutely not.

Well, doesn’t the record shoxj he did —
MR. BRUCKER:

Q

The providing of Phenyl - 2 - Propcmone **~

Absolutely not.

Doesn't the record shot-? that on the second occasion

he did obtain it from some place else?
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

Bo,

Well, what was in that extra bottle?
MR. BRUCKER:

There was no laboratory analysis of that

extra bottle, first of all, despite what the Government says.
The record is clear about that.
The second bottle was obtained in a search on
January 10, 1970.
Richard Russell, my client, the respondent in this
case, had nothing to do with that.
Q

X said it was obtained.
MR. BRUCKER;

Q

This was in Connolly’s —

It was obtained by somebody else.

But it was obtainable.
MR. BRUCKER:

You said it wasn’t obtainable.

Wo. I misunderstood, Your Honor.

X am saying two things.

One, we don’t know --

although I am not pressing this — we don’t know that it was,

32

in fact, Phenyl-2-Fropanone.

It was not analysed by the

Government agent who testified at this trial*
Q

Is there anything in the record to show that there

was no way for them to obtain this except through the Govern­
ment agent?
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

Ho.

Of course not.
ME. BRUCKER:

What it shows is that the Government

agent —
Q

Facilitated it.
MR. BRUCKER:

Q

They had dried up the supply.

And they facilitated it.
Suppose the agent gave the paper for counterfeit

money.

Would that be entrapment?
MR. BRUCKER:

Q

That would be counterfeiting?
MR, BRUCKER:

Q

Yes, that’s what McGrath held.

Certainly.

And the reason is you can’t obtain that paper

any place else except from the Government.
MR. BRUCKER:

But that doesn't prevent» that doesn't

prevent counterfeit bills from being —
Q

Easily determined to be counterfeit bills, unless

they have the right paper.
MR. BRUCKER:

Well, from that point of view* if you

have the right weight of paper, and that type of thing, the

33
only '©ay that can come is from the Government.
Q

Hell, is all of the "speed” in this country that we

read about outside of this record, is that ail obtained from
the Government?
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

Ho, Your Honor.

So it is obtainable, isn’t it?
MR. BRUCKER:

Q

"Speed" is, yes,

Ho, I mean this ingredient is obtainable.
MR. BRUCKER:

Well, Propanone is not necessary for

all types of manufacture of "speed," Your Honor.

It was just

in this particular type of manufacture.
Q

Well, does the record show that this man had been

manufacturing it before?
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

Ho.

Where did he get that "speed"'.Cablet that he gave

Shapiro on the first trip?
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

He did not give it to Shapiro.

Wbe did he give it to?
MR, BRUCKER:

It was Patrick Connolly.

Mr. Russell did not give it to anybody.
There were many people in this room

where Agent Shapiro came in.

There were the two Connolly

brothers, there was Richard Russell, there was the Government
informant, there was another man, and there were two girls.
Q

There was "speed" there in this room and it was there

before the Government furnished anything.

34

MR. BRUCKER:

Yes,

But Richard Russell had nothing

-** the only thing Richard Russell had to do with- that
Q

*•“

Is it your position that Richard Russell wouldn’t

have gotten involved if the agent hadn’t talked to his?
MR. BRUCKER:

It is my firm argument that there is

no evidence that the crime for which he x<as convicted would
have gone ahead without Shapiro giving Phenyl-2-Propanone.
Q

It looked like quite a production line there, with

four, five, six people Involved.
Ml. BRUCKER: Your Honor, this is on Uhidfcey Island,
which is north of Seattle, and it was a home and these people
are not particularly organised*

People come and go.

This is

the common way of life for an awful lot of people.
Q

I am speaking of a production line for the production

of "speed."
MR. BRUCKER:

Oh, no, Your Honor.

As the record

reflects, this was in the kitchen and in the —
Q

Like a homemade still.
MR, BRUCKER:

Q

That's right, sure.

Yes, well, it is a production line, nevertheless,

and did produce.
MR. BRUCKER:
Q

Yes, it did.

Before the agent's appearance, during the agent's

participation and at times after he had left.
MR. BRUCKER:

That9: not to suggest that Richard

35
Russell bad anything to do with that*
Q

In your view, he is just living there?
UR* MUCKER:

house.

Ho, Your Honor*

This was not his

This was Patrick Connolly's house which was 15 miles

away from Richard Russell’s house*
Unless X get the point across to this Court that
Richard Russell did not do the act, both before and after,we
are going to have to get to the predisposition argument*
Q

What you are doing in that, if I may suggest it,

Mr. Brucker, you are arguing the sufficiency of the evidence«
Ml. BRUCKER:
Q

Absolutely. I am.

Yes.

That’s a different question from the legal question,

you would agree, wouldn't you?
MR. BRUCKER:

I’ve suggested three grounds on which

the Court of Appeals could be affirmed, one of which is to
accept their due process consideration,

the second of which

is to state that under Sorrells and Sherman the activities of
the Government arise to creative activity and manufacturing,
and the third ground is that under the supervisory power of
this Court to adopt the separate opinion in Sherman and Sorrells.
But I do believe there is a grave question as to
the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the issue of entrap­
ment to the jury.
The important facts that I think this Court must
pay attention to are four.

36
One, X believe, .first of all,is that the proposal
to supply the Fropanona came frora Shapiro»
How, Shapiro is the only agent that testified, but
there were four or five surveilling agents outside the house
at all times*

This just wasn’t a one-man operation»

That

same day they determined where the Laboratory was*
But, I think it is important that the offer to
supply came from the Government agent.

This is not a

situation like United States v, Lope.?;, where the defendant
made an unsolicited offer to the IBS agent for a bribe»
And I think there is no dispute on that point.
The second aspect that I think is important in the
factual record of this matter is the critical aspect of the
chemical involved.
This was a catalyst, the Propancne, and it was
impossible to produce ’’speed1’ without it.
Uou could have all the laboratory, all the flasks,
all the spoons, all the bottles, everything else, and without
Phenyl-2-Propanone, you get nothing.
As the record reflects here, ’’And you can have
everything else and if you don’t have the Propahone you cannot
manufacture methamphetamine.”

Answer:

"Ho.

Without the

Phenyl-2-Propanone, you could not get the reaction to get
me thamphe tamine. ’’
’’Absent the Propanone, you put everything else in

37
there described by Mr. Shapiro, what would you get?”
And this was a chemist testifying -~
5'Not a great deal of any kind of product, you see,
because the product depends upon the reaction of Phenyl-2Propanone,

That is the whole idea.

The other things that

are in there are simply for solvents or for the generation of
hydrogen for condensation,”
So this is not — as the Government would attempt
to characterize this — it’s just an isolated drug which they
just happened to provide.

It is the absolute heart of the

manufacture of "speed” in this case.
And it is perfectly clear that the "speed”

that

the chemical provided by the Government was used to manufacture
the "speed,”
Q

Isn't that true, though, with lots of chemical

formulas that may have four or five ingredients, that absent
any one of them, you wouldn't get the end product?
MR, BRUCKER:

Not from the — that may well be, but

I don’t think that that is true in this case just from the
testimony of the chemist.
The one critical item is the Phenyl-2-Fropanone, and
the others apparently, as he said, are simply for solvents.
But you don't get "speed” unless you have Phenyl-2Propanone.
Q

Suppose it was bicarbonate of soda that they needed to

38
complete this process and they didn’t have any in the house
that day and the stores were closed and the agent had supplied
one for them, said he had some at home and went home and got it
and brought it back.

What would you think the situation would

be there?
MR, BRUCKER:

I find that's a different case. Your

Honor.
Q

Different case factually from this?
This substance was obtainable from' other sources,

as Justice Marshall has pointed out*
MR. BRUCKER:

But the Government at least concedes

it was difficult to obtain.
Q

X mean that’s «*»

Whan the stores are closed, it is difficult to get

bicarbonate of soda, unless you borrow come from a neighbor.
MR. BRUCKER:

That may be, although, to me, there

is a vast distinction between something which is available in
every drug store and a chemical which you can only get by
having a license, in the first place, and, two, which agents
of the Bureau of Dangerous Drug3 have gone around to the drug
supply houses and say, "Please, don’t sell It at all, even
with a license."
So X think that is a complete different

—

What the Government agents have done is to dry up
the supply, mate it difficult to obtain, knowing it is a very
critical item and then say, !tHere."

39
Q

In other words, when the man goes around to five

or six placas and can’t get any, then his appetite is whetted.
He is in an extreme situation,
MR* BRUCKEE:

Ho,

But the other side of that coin

might also he true, Your Honor, and that is if you can’t get
it perhaps he wouldn’t even have completed the manufacturing
at all,
Q

Of course, it also follows that .

you wouldn’t want

it for something else, would you?

m. BEUCKER:
Q

You would only want it to make an illegal drug.
MEL. BEUCKER:

Q

Ho.

That’s correct.

And so the Government makes it difficult.

Suppose

the Government froze it up and only had it available at one
address, and had that all under surveillance?

Would that be

entrapment?
HR. BRUCKEE:

There is a difference because the

Government is not, in fact — the agent is not, in fact,
providing — but I don’t see a meaningful distinction between
that, because what they’ve made It only then from one source,
and you always have the —
Q

X think your position is that if the Government makes

it possible in any way for them to get it, they can't prosecute,
HE. BEUCKER:

That's not true, Your Honor,

taking that position at all.

I am not

X am saying what the facts of this

40
case show that what the Government is doing is promoting
crime *
Q

Promoting?
MR. BRUCKER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Because what they are doing in this case is to
provide something that, without which

for all the record

shows —
Q

Bid they promote this first batch before Shapiro

got there?
Ml. BRUCKER:

Ho, Your Honor, but what did Richard

Russell have to do —
Q

Did the Government promote that?
MR. BRUCKERt

Q

Was that a crime?
MR. BRUCKER:

charged and which
Q
"speed”?

Ho.

Hot for which Richard Russell is

—

Was somebody guilty of that crime, whoever made that
Russell or somebody?
MR. BRUCKER:

Somebody, yes.

I would agree with

that.
Q

The Government didn't promote that, did it?
MR. BRUCKER:

Wo.

But that's not the charge for which Richard Russell
is here before this Court and what he was convicted of,
Q

The Government persuaded Russell to go in the "speed"

41
business.
BRUCKER:
Q

For all intents and purposes, that’s your position.
IH. BRUCKER:

Q

For all, Your Honor —

Yes, because there is no evidence —

At least I understand your position.
MR. BRUCKER:

Your Honor, Richard Russell had never

been convicted of any crime before.

There was no evidence that

he had ever been involved in the manufacturing, there was not
even the evidence as to the involvement of Russell to the
extent of Mr. Sorrells.
The record — the opinion of this Court in Sorrells
states that the Government produced three witnesses that showed
that Mr. Sorrells was a rum-runner, but there is absolutely
nothing in this record that shows that Richard Russell was
anything other than a law-abiding citizen.

There just isn’t

any,
I would also like to say this.

In the reply brief

— I suggested in my brief that the Government show where there
was such evidence in the record, and in the reply brief they
declined to do that, and also make an error, stating that it
was Richard Russell who made statements about having the
"speed," and that was corrected this morning, because that did
not happen.
'Q

Which is to say that there is a factual error in

the Government brief?

42

MR* BRUCKER:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Mr. Lacovara spoke accurately this morning on page
4 of the reply brief in the second paragraph, about ten lines
from the bottom, talking about ho, moaning Richard Russell,
— but that, obviously, was one of the Connolly brothers.
And Mr, Lacovara so argued this morning,
Q

As I recall Mr, Lacovara‘s argument, Mr, Brucker, he

referred to some exchange where Richard Russell said, "After
1 get my half,"
MR, BRUCKER:

Yes, that was on the 10th of December

1969, that was after Shapiro had provided the chemical and
the drug was produced.
Q

In the light of that, do you still say there is

nothing in the record that shows he was anything other than
a law-abiding citisen?
MR, BRUCKER:
prior record.
Q

Oh, 1 am talking about prior to —

Oh, absolutely.

Contrasted with Sorrells?
MR. BRUCKER:

That's correct.

clearly committed the acts in this case.

Right,

Right,

He

No question about

that.
What I am basically saying, and what 1 basically
argue to this Court, is that this Court has not heretofore
had the opportunity to consider a case that, on the facts,
where the Government has provided the indispensable ingredient,

43
the contraband, I am going to assume, now, that Richard Russell
has all kinds of predisposition, that he «as involved before
and after, although I don*t think the record supports it,
1 as going to assume that now.
But no caso that this Court has been called upon
to decide has gone to the extent «here the Government intrudes
itself to this extent in the investigation and prosecution of
crimes.
The history of entrapment has been basically set
out in our brief.

The first Federal case

«as as recent as

1915, and the defense of entrapment has been basically caused
by the growth of the statutory crimes where there is clandestine
operations and it is hard to find out what is going on.
By the time, in 1932, when Sorrells was decided,
Mr. Justice Roberts characterised the entrapment defenses as
an amusing total.
All the circuits had agreed that the entrapment
defense was available, and then this Court agreed.
What I am suggesting is that we have a parallel
situation today.

This different factual situation where the

Government Intrudes into the criminal process to the extent
that he has, has been considered by many courts — lower courts
— ©very single one of them has found that the Government
activity is intolerable and has reversed the convictions.
Every single one-of them, without dissent, except in my case, in

44
the 9th Circuit here,
McGrath, Bueno3 5th Circuit, 7fch Circuit, District
Court cases, Southern District of Hew York, California,
highest court of Illinois, highest court of Arizona, they
have considered problems where the Government has intruded
to this extent, and they have all found theta bad.
And that’s why 1 am saying that we have a different
cas© that has not been considered by this Court,
Q

Have these been based on a constitutional foundation?
MR* BRUCKER:

Ho, they have not, Your Honor, but

they have — except this case -~
Q

With the exception of this case, have the others?
MR. BRUCKER:

Ho.

But what I am saying is that they — that the courts
below have tortured their reasoning, tortured their opinions,
because they are outraged by what the Government does, but
can’t find a handle on which to articulate what the basis is,
what law they are talking about as to why it is bad.
They are talking about enlarging the holding of
Sorrells and She naan.

They talked about that really — because

this Court has invited review of this, what really now is the
law is the separate opinion in Sherman and Sorrells, but nobody
.r- they are unanimous in reversing but they are not unanimous
in their reasoning.
And we all look to this Court for its reasoning, but

45
1 am saying that this type of thing had never been considered
before.
It is all right for the Government to provide a
substitute crime, That's ©hat entrapment is, providing a sub­
stituto crime. But it is not all right for the Government to go
further*

There is no legitimate State interest in the govern­

ment going further and providing the one means by which that
crime could be committed.
And that is ©hat this case is all about.

Without

Shapiro providing that Phenyl-2-Fropanone, the evidence does
not support the fact that this crime would be committed.
And I've — you've got to look at that problem in deciding
this case.
The evils to be countenanced are set forth in say
brief.

Sir. Justice Frankfurter has articulated them in the

separate opinion of Sherman.
I don't like to go with slogans, but I would only
suggest to the Court that if this type of activity is upheld
it would be the ends justifying the means9 which is really not
sacttoned in our system.
And,for those reasons, I ask that the opinion of the
Court of Appeals be affirmed,

m. CEXSSF JUSTICE BUBGER:

Thank you, Mr. Brucker,

Mr, Brucker, you appeared here at our request and
by appointment to the Court and we thank you for your assistance

46

to, not only your client, but to the Court.
