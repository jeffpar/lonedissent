Mr. Riddle, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERYL L. RIDDLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RIDDLE:

Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the

Court:
This case is before the Court to review* a decision
of the Eighth Circuit.
The plaintiff below, who is respondent here, Mr. Percy
Green, is a Black man, and the defendant below, who is petitioner
here, is McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
We will refer to the parties to this suit by the
names Mr. Green and by McDonnell during the course of the
argument to the Court.
Mr. Green was a mechanic and had worked at McDonnell
Dougas from 1956 up until the time of his layoff in 1964.
s

During that period of time, he had established work
record that qualified him by the rating records of the super­
visors at the plant as being of average, or, I suppose said
another way, satisfactory.
He was, in that period of time, well, up until 1963,
he was a member of the union and, as such, was protected by
the union rights as it had bargained with the company for, such

4
as seniority, and what have you.
However, in 1962, the respondent here, Mr. Green,
became interested in doing some work outside of the work that
he had been doing, and made inquiry as to whether or not he
could be transferred over to the electronics division of
McDonnell.
At that time, he was told by his supervisors and
people with whom he worked that for him to transfer over to
that division would cause him to give up whatever seniority
rights and whatever protection he had under the laoor contract*
And it was pointed out to him that Chat new depart­
ment Chat he was looking at was engaged in work related to the
GEMINI program, that could be a one-shot contract, and because
of that there was some uncertainty as to the durability of it.
Well, considering those factors, in 1962, Mr. Green
declined to transfer and didn't make an application.

A few

months later, the next year, Mr. Green again looked over at
>

the other department and decided that maybe he should transfer.
The pay wasn’t significantly greater but apparently it was a
more prestigious position and would utilise his skills to a
greater extent.
When he looked at it the second time, he was again
advised that because, "You remember the union now.

You have

certain seniority rights.*’ And again, "This is the GEMINI
program and you may, when you get over there, as a non-union

member,

employee of McDonnell, you won't have the security of

the job that you have now.”
Well, in spite of that, he decided to make the
transfer, and for approximately a year thereafter —

q

That was in 1963?
MR. RIDDLE:

That was in 1963 -- for approximately a

year thereafter he worked as a technician over in the electronic
division, working on simulators for the GEMINI program.
Well, as was predicted by some, the program was
winding down and there was a layoff coming up.

The company,

using a pattern, or using a practice in this particular instance
that they had used before called the totem pole, referred to
in the case, made a determination that some of the excess
technicians working on that program would have to be dismissed.
And in due course of time9Mr. Green and 14 or 15 others, in
fact, were dismissed or laid off.
At the time that they were laid off, at the time .
Mr. Green was laid off, he made some protest to his superiors
and to some of the executives of McDonnell and pointed out that
in his opinion he was being discriminated because he was a
Black man and because he was a known protestor and leader in
civil rights activities around town.

He pointed out that his

position in those activities was such that the company would

oe

taking some risk if they laid him off.
But, in spite of the various and prolonged discussions,

o

he was laid off.
Now, sometime after, within a few weeks, and, in fact
October, 1964, Mr. Green participated in what's referred to in
the record and in the oriefs as a "stall-in."
Now, this stall-in as was referred to by some of the
witnesses in the case, as an attempt to sabotage the facility
and the operations of McDonnell.
I think to fully understand the significance and the
impact of the stall-in I would call the Court's attention to
pages 5758 and 59 of the Volume I of the Appendix.
Q

What pages?
MR.„ RIDDLE:

page 507, 508 and 509.

It's in Volume I of the Appendix, at
It's the last two or three pages in

the — in that volume.
A look at the plan that was devised by Mr. Green and
others, one can readily see that this wasn’t a carelessly plannee
program.

It was designed carefully and for the purpose of

totally disrupting the flow of traffic to and from the plant
facilities of McDonnell which are located on and near the
airport, Lambert Field in St. Louis.
The plan being to park cars on roads that led to the
access and roads that led away during a shift change where
something between 10 and 15 thousand people are going to be
going to and from on limited access.

And this is not a case

such as a football field where there are roads coming into it

7
from all directions.

This is a case where there is an airport

and the access roads are much more limited than the typical
installation.
Q

Is the plant of the company right out there near the

regular SC. Louis airport?
MR. RIDDLE:

Yes, it is.

It is right near the runways

and, in fact, the manufacturing facilities are principally on
the runway itself, or on the airport itself,
Q

On the airport grounds.
MR, RIDDLE:

Yes.

So, as a result of this activity, the participants,
in fact, drove their cars and parked them at strategically
located positions.

And at that time, as the plan called for,

they locked their doors, they put their brakes on, they shut
their motor off, and planned to stay there in that position for
at least one hour.

And they were instructed to stay there and

resist being taken away unless the officers made certain
explanations to them as to why they should leave.
How, the impact of a complete stall-in or a blockage
of traffic at that time and under those conditions could have **and except for alert police activity, could have been catastrophic,
and could have destroyed an entire shift operation at the plant.
And the amount of money and the amount of property, potentially,
subject to destruction or damage as a result of this is very,
very substantial.

8
Mow, following that program, Hr. Green was arrested
and paid a fine, and found guilty.
Sometime thereafter, I believe it was July 2, 1963,
Mr. Green had continued in his activities, some of which were
lawful and some of which were unlawful, and at that time his
group action locked the gates, doors, at a building that housed
McDonnell Douglas personnel downtown at a time when the
employees were attempting to leave the building.
The effect of this was to temporary imprison the
occupants of the building during a period of time that they
would have been leaving.
Then, on July 22nd, just a few days after the lock-in
at the Roberts Building downtown, Mr. Green applied for a job
as a mechanic at McDonnell Douglas.
Q

Does the record show whether or not he was employed

during this period,after his original layoff from your company?
MR. RIDDLE:

The record indicates that he was

employed off and on, but I don't believe the employment was
steady or with one employer throughout that period of time.
Of course, when he made this application, the
reaction from the people at McDonnell was predictable.

They

said, ,'Nqs we will not be able to use you."
Following that, he filed his complaint with the EGG.
The EOC made its investigation and made its report.

They

found that there was rea enable basis for Mr. Green to bring a

9
lawsuit, and he filed one at that time under Section 704 of
the Act.
The case came on for trial, well, after a period of
time had passed.

Mr. Green filed his lawsuit in the United

States District Court in Missouri.

It came on for trial before

Chief Judge Meredith there, and it was tried for about four
days.
During the course of the trial, or before the trial
actually began, Green made an effort to amend his petition to
include race or cause of action under 703 in addition to 704,
and that was denied by the court.
The case went to trial under 704, but during the
course of the trial, Green attempted to interject 1981 Civil
Eights Act as a basis for his discretion and a trial of the
issues involving race.
At the close of that case, Judge Meredith made some
findings, one of which was that the evidence shows that
plaintiffs civil rights activities were not considered as a
factor in the decision to lay off the plaintiff.
And then he made these findings, and I think it is
important for the Court to carefully consider just what was
before Judge Meredith, and what it was that he found.

He says

the plaintiff contends that defendant violated 704(3) because
of his opposition to employment practices.

Plaintiff also

contends in his post-trial brief that defendant’s refusal to

10
hire hira was based on race and his participation in civil
rights activities, violation of 1981.
And this important conclusion and finding by the
court;

the court feels that the court's discussion of the

case under 704 will effectively dispose of any claim arising
under Section 1981.
And these are the controlling standards that Judge
Meredith applied in reaching his decision.

He says this,

"In the matter before the Court, the controlling and ultimate
fact questions are:

(1) whether the plaintiff's misconduct is

sufficient to justify defendant's refusal to rehire, and (2)
whether the "stall in" and "lock in" are the real reasons fox
defendant's refusal to rehire the plaintiff.

The court £i.nds

that they are."
Then the trial court proceeded to say that the
plaintiff there, Mr. Green, had failed to establish by the
greater weight or preponderance that the defendant's refusal
to rehire plaintiff resulted from racial prejudice or plaintiff's
legitimate civil rights activities.
It seems clear from the record, and I am again
quoting His Honor, "that the defendant's reasons for refusing
to rehire the plaintiff were motivated solely and simply by the
plaintiff's participation in the stall in and the lock in
demonstrations.

The burden of proving other reasons was on the

Circuit.

MR. RIDDLE:

Under 703.
MR. RIDDLE:

Rut the conclusion of the court there.

Your Honor, was plaintiff has not shown that defendant was
motivated by racial prejudice or because of plaintiff's
legitimate civil rights activities.
Q

He niade the joint finding.

It is your submission, I think, that although the

amendment to the complaint v?as not allowed, that nonetheless
in the course of the tria3, it was by agreement, implicit
agreement, that issue was tried.
MR. RIDDLE:

It was tried and it was tried thoroughly.

And four days of trial and a careful reading of the transcript
will indicate that at least 80% of all subjects inquired about
and all questions do relate to the question of race.
And:I think it was for that reason that the trial
judge, the District judge, felt that under the contentions
being made that he could dispose of that issue in this case
and did dispose of it.
Q

Although he had, so far as the record goes, so far

12
as the formal record goes, he had stricken and not permitted
that issue to be tried in this lawsuit.

That’s correct, isn't

it?
MR. RIDDLE:

If the lawsuit had been tried consistent

with what that ruling, striking race, if it had been tried
consistent with that theory, yes, I don’t think there would be
any validity in our position at all.
But, in fact, it wasn’t, it was tried thoroughly,
and this was the feeling of one member of the panel of the
Eifchth Circuit and, apparently, shared by four members of that
court.
Q

Mr. Riddle, I understand the respondent to contend

even if it was tried by consent that he was handicapped by
the trial court’s failure to allow discovery on that account.
;

What’s your response to that contention?
MR. RIDDLE:

My position on that, Your Honor, is this,

that there was adequate discovery, and there was enough
discovery here to allow that issue to be tried.

There was

discovery opportunities available to the plaintiff’s counsel
that he didn’t avail himself of, and voluminous records were,
in fact, raade available to him and he used during the course
of the trial.
We think that the ruling made in the pre-trial, as
to the extent of the discovery, was based upon the unreasonable­
ness and burdensomeness of it.

It required for tenfe and

13
thousand’s and thousand’s of documents that would have
required weeks and weeks just to prepare, all on an issue
that doesn’t seem to be relevant to any of the issues that the
case presented.
Now, the Eighth Circuit looked at the decision below
and affirmed it in every respect except it sent it back for a
retrial on the racial discrimination issue.
Now, if the court had stopped there and used the
basis raised by His Honor, that it had been stricken and
so, maybe he didn’t have his full day in court, go on back
and try it again —* if it stopped there, the case wouldn’t be
here today.

But the court did some very significant additions

to just that.
It said, one, that the prima-facie case is made
when the applicant here, a Black man --1 think I should read
that exactly as it is from out of the court’s opinion, "when
a Black man demonstrates that he possesses the qualifications
to fill a job opening, and that he was denied the job which
continues to remain open, we think he presents a prima-facie
case of racial discrimination."
Now, what that does is to reverse at the point when
Judge Meredith says it was up

to the plaintiff in that case to

establish that his

discharge, or the refusal to reinstatehim,

was based upon his

race, that this was a burden that the

petitioner, or the

plaintiff, had in the lower court.

14
The Eighth Circuit i© saying that he merely makes
bbat .prirna-^facie showing and then the burden is upon the
company, McDonnell here, to establish that it «as not racially
motivated.
Now, in addition to that, the shifting of the burden
of proof

I might say at this juncture that Congress, in

considering this, one of the floor managers -- we've cited that
in our brief — one of the floor managers carefully explained
to Members of Congress that the burden of proof in these cases,
under Title 7, will be as it has always been, that the burden
will always be on the plaintiff, the person bringing the lawsuit.
*Vnd it made it abundantly clear that this is what Congress in­
tended .
Here, the Eighth Circuit, by its opinion, is shifting
that burden of proof.
But, that’3 not all it did.

Second off, it said that

subjective evidence from the employer, In this case, from
McDonnell, would be given little weight or its weight would be
limited.
In the context of this case

— and I might say

further to that — the third thing it said was that somehow
McDomiel would have to establish or show that under these
circumstances its refusal to rehire Green was related to job
performance, while limiting the value or the weight of subjective
evidence as the Eighth Circuit opinion did, plus the other

15
imposition added, plus the burden of weight shifting, caused
one member of the Eighth Circuit to think that the effect of
this opinion would be to order McDonnell to reinstate or rehire
Green.

And that view, apparently, was shared by four members

of the court.
I think it is clear when the employer here is
inhibited by testifying 33 to his reasons,subjective reasons,
for making employment decisions, that when that i3 being
told

when the Eighth Circuit is telling the District Court
*

that you are to give very little weight to that, we think that
that means practically that once the plaintiff, Green, here,
would make this prim-facie case, that we couldn't rebut that
prima-facie case then by stowing that our refusal to employ him
was because he attempted to sabotage our plant, or lock sense
of our employees into the office building downtown.
I think the Eighth Circuit is saying that this is
to be given very little weight and it probably will not justify
your actions in refusing to employ.
Mow, there seems to be no question but what unlawful
activity of any person would be adequate justification for
an employer to refuse to hire.

And I think that would be true

whether the applicant is White, whether he is an Xtidian or
whether he is Black, or whether he is a Baptist or Jew or
Catholic.

1 think that that is clear.
And 1 think the effect of this opinion, if it is

applied literally, will cause and create reverse discrimination.
For example, I don’t think it could be seriously
questioned that if a White man were to throw a rock in the
Chairman of McDonnell’s window last night and he called me5
this morning and says can X discharge the man,I would cay yes.
Q

You could also say put him in jail.
MR. RIDDLE:

Ye$.

And, if a Black man were to throw, by this opinion
as it has been interpreted, and as we interpret it, a rock
through his window, and he asked me if he could discharge him,
I would have to say, following the mandate of this opinion,
"We'11 have to look to see how this might adversely influence
his ability to perform the job."
Q

But you could still put him in jail.
MR. RIDDLE:

Still put him in jail.

But when he

got out of jail, if we had to look at job performance, then
we could very well be in the position of having to get into
that before I could be at ease in saying, "No, you can’t
discharge him."
I use that as an illustration of how —
Q

The question would be, must we hire him, rather than

can we discharge him?
MR. RIDDLE:
Your Honor.

Isn’t it?
I think the rule would be the same,

I think it applies, not only to discharge , I think

it would apply to promotion and I think it would apply to job

17
applicants.
Q

Yes.
MR. RIDDLE:

What remaining time X have, I would like

to reserve for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Gilden.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS GILDEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GILDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In answer to a question posed by Mr. Justice Stewart,
I want to comment that Judge Meredith stated that, "The-.court
feels that the court's discussion of the case -Q

Where are you reading from?
MR. GILDEN:

I am reading from page A-45 of the

Petition for Writ of Certiorari.
"The court feels that the Court’s discussion of the
case under 42 U.S.C. i2000e-3(a), (that's 704(a)) will
effectively dispose of any claim arising under section 1981.
Section 42 U.S.C. i2000e~(a).
That's on the bottom of page A~45.
This case was treated as a 704 case all the way
through.
And, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I submit that Judge Lay's
comments that the Hebrew expression, "We tie their handr and

lb
then reproach them because they don9t use them,is a classic
statement in this particular case, because Plaintiff Green
attempted to get statistical information by interrogatories,
by motion to produce for inspection. And on the question of
interrogatories, the court struck-the interrogatories on the
ground that they were oppressive.
On the question of the motion to produce for in­
spection, the court said, specifically, in its opinion, that
this is a race case, and, therefore, you are not entitled to
all these statistics.

%

So, therefore, on two occasions, plaintiff had to
come in and try this case knowing full well what the decision
of the court was, 704(a), both on the question of motion to
produce for inspection and both in the comments of the court
in its opinion that it is a 704(a) case.
This case was tried totally as a 704(a) case.
The only statistics that were brought into court
were by Mr. Peter Robertson who is a representative of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and he came in on the
eve of trial.

He was at that time, in 1965, a representative

of the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, and he at that time,

If this was a race ease, I would like to see it.
It lias never been submitted as a statistical case before
Judge Meredith.

It was totally a 704(a); case.

The records that were brought in by Mr. Peter

nothing to do with it.

MR. GILDEN:

Q

And the stall in?
MR. GILDEH:

The stall in did fake place.

Mr. Green pled guilty to the stall in.

He was out

And I submit to the Court that in October of 1964
there was no Equal Employment Opportunity Act.

We didn’t know about 1901 at that

That became somewhat crystal clear after Jones v. Mayor.

Me didn’t know about 1981.
We all knew about an Equal Employment Act that had
been enacted in July of 1964 to become effective in July of
1965.

That’s all we knew.
And on that particular day, what was he protesting?

He was protesting discrimination in employment at McDonnell
Douglas.
Q

That’s what he was doing.
Is it your position that that includes the right to

use unlawful means and that those unlawful means may never be
then taken into account?
MR. GXLDEN:

No, Your Honor, I don’t submit that.

That isn't ray position in this case.
McDonnell can use that reason.

But I think what one

has to look at, which is what the Court of Appeals had before
it, was a record on 704(a).
They had a record before them that showed the
treatment of Green when he was working for McDonnell Douglas,
and they saw that in August of 1964, when this totem pole was
drawn up, that the Vice President of McDonnell Douglas, based
upon the evidence of Mr. Robertson, drew a line over Green’s
name.

And he was the highest senior man in a whole department

of 100 Whits men, in a research department, the only Black man#

MR. GILDEN:

Your Honor» I think it is important in

terms of what the Court felt a prima-facie case would be in
the opinion of the Eighth Circuit.
1 think it is a question of what the court knew at
that particular time, based upon the evidence before it, and
what Green would introduce in the race case, and that he
would show the treatment he had to show that the treatment of
discrimination when he worked there continued when he applied
for the job.

Mr. Windsor said there were fourteen or fifteen reasons why
he wasn’t hired.

Fourteen or fifteen reasons — now,they only

used two reasons, and they also brought in the record that there
was a picketing of Mr. McDonnell's home from the street, not
anywhere near the house.

One of the witnesses talked about

that as a basis for not hiring.
Q

If there was one good reason, the fact that there

were fourteen others would make no difference, would it?
MR, GILDEN:

That would be a matter for the trial on

the race case before the District Court.

Yes, but when the Court of Appeals remanded it, they

undertook to try to allocate the burden of proof.

In fact, the second question presented by McDonnell

here doesn’t even relate to the decision.
They did not bar McDonne 11 from introducing subjective
evidence. Mottling in the opinion is saying that, nothing.

What is your answer to the Chief Justice's question,

that what do you find in the statute that supports the Court
of Appeals decision on the burden of proof and on prima-facie
case?
MR. GILDEN:

There is nothing specifically iu the

statute relating to what the burden of proof would be in a
case involving an application for employment, no*- specifically

But the court had before it a somewhat shallow record

based on 704(a).

because after they said that McDonnell would have to show that
the reasons they didn't hire Green were because he was ir­
responsible toward his work.

They then said that Green would

have to corae back and show that the reasons were pretextual
or else that McDonnell Douglas had engaged in racially dis­
criminatory practices at the plant.
And they showed what the burden would have to be
with Green later on.

They didn't anticipate that he could rest

at the clone of his prima-facie» so-called, minimal prima-facie
showing, that he would have to come back.
They also knew that McDonnell would come in with
the stall in as a reason and then Green would have to come in
and show that reason was pretextual.
Q

What's your response to Mr. Riddle's contention that

in the Congressional debate preceding the enactment of this
the question of prima-facie case was considered and the
Congressional conclusion was that the burden of proof should be
on the plaintiff at all stages?
MR. GXLDEN: There is no question that the burden of
proof is on the plaintiff, Your Honor, and there is no question
that Green was called upon to assume that burden before the

25
District Court.

There is no question about that.

And I would say to this Court that McDonnell hasn’t
even appealed that point to this Court.
raised it.

They haven’t even

They have raised two hypothetical questions before

this Court that are merely going to be somewhat helpful, I
assume, if this Court remands this case to the District Court,
in terms of what some of the guidelines and standards might be.
In a Title 7 case, is an employer supposed to hire

a

person who engages --a Black man who engages in unlawful
activities?

That’s a matter for the District Court to decide

in -- if that were the only fact presented, that would be a
matter of judgment for the District Court, but the court
contemplated more facts.

It contemplated more discovery,

more information.
I might submit — I might submit it is not part of
this record at all, and it’s a matter not in the record.

It

is a matter that was presented by the Appendix in the Appellate
Court that subsequent to these proceedings the F-15 contract
was denied to McDonnell Douglas by the Secretary of Defense
on the ground that they were discriminating against Blacks
That was subsequent to the trial of Percy Green against
McDonnell Douglas.
Now, if the contract was denied to McDonnell Douglas
on the F“15 because they were engaged in racial discrimination,
I am quite sure that relates some substance

not for just

going back to the court on some pretenses but on the basis that
we have something to talk about.
Q

Suppose instead of having just engaged in a -» the

blocking of the highway, stall in, I guess it is called here,
he had thrown some dynamite under trucks of the McDonnell
Douglas, would you think then McDonnell Douglas would have to
assume the burden of showing by objective evidence, some
objective evidence, to use the Gourt of Appeals1 term, that
that rendered him an unsuitable employee?
MR. GILDEN:

Well, Your Honor, the dynamite, Mr, Chief

Justice, the dynamiting certainly would be objective evidence.
There is nothing subjective about dynamiting a building, I
would —
Q

Well, is there anything subjective about blocking a

public highway?
MR. GILDEN:

The Court never said, Mr. Chief Justice,

that they couldn't introduce that.

They just said that -~

the court found that McDonnell would come in with that evidence
in the race case —
Q

But the court instructed the Trial Court, in effect,

you don't have to pay any attention to that and really said,
"You'd better not pay any attention to it."
MR. GILDEN:
opinion that way.
Q

Your Honor, I don't really read the

I read it on the basis --

That's the way I read it.

27
MR, GULDEN:

Well, it doesn't say that, specifically.

It says that -Q

I don't know how you could read it any other way.
MR. GULDEN:

Well, it says that employment decisions

based upon objective criteria carry little weight.
They didn't say they forbade them from producing
it as evidence — carried little weight.
And that's just a line of decisions that the Eighth
Circuit just went ahead and went along with.

That wasn't a

fact that they were mandating District Court to keep out the
stall in.

The stall in was objective.

There is nothing

subjective about a stall in.
Q

Well, and that evidence was before the District Court,

wasn't it?
MR. GILDEN:
Q

Yes.
MR. GILDEN:

Q

The stall in?

Yes, it was.

And the District Court decided the case on that

basis, did they not?
MR. GILDEN:
the 704(a) issue.

On the 704(a) issue, Your Honor.

On

They decided on that basis, because the

court was very specific about how it was trying this case.
They never — the court never changed its opinion.
In its opinion and its ruling on the discovery, it
said it was not a race case.

It was a 704(a) civil rights

28
protest case.
And there were two allegations that Green had made
in his complaint before EOC, civil rights and the question of
race.
And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had
merely made one finding, and that was on civil rights and what
the District Court did was strike race because it felt that
there had to be a reasonable cause finding as a jurisdictional
prerequisite to the institution of an action under Title 7.
In fact, McDonnell were the one3 who filed the motion
to strike race from the pleading.
its own.

The court didn't do it on

And the court held it was not a race case, and the

case was tried strictly on that.
Q

Mr. Gilden, what do you understand the court to have

meant by this, "If McDonnell can demonstrate that Green's
participation in the stall in in some objective way reflects
adversely upon job performance, McDonnell's refusal to rehire
Green will be justified"?
MR. GILDEN:
Q

MR. GILDEN:

opinion.

Q

What page is that?

Your Honor, that was excised from the

That's the original opinion.

That was excised.

Oh, it was?
MR. GILDEN:

And that's why I want — we had carried

see, Point 5 was totally excised and changed by Judge Bright,

29
and the opinion was changed from a Griggs opinion to a nonGriggs opinion.
And so there is some confusion in this because you
have to read the new Point 5 which is carried on page A-31.
Q

You think there is no significance to be attached to

the content of Section 5 after they excised it?
MR. GILDEN:

You mean the original Point A-5?

don't think it has any bearing whatsoever.

I

The court made a

change in its decision, and I think we are only called upon to
make decisions upon the change.

I don't think we are called

upon to anticipate or to — no court would be bound by a court
that struck an original opinion, use the original opinion as
a basis for law.
The only opinion we have before us is A-31 to A-33,
which is close to two pages that sets forth the standards,
and in that case they said, "However, an applicant's past
participation in unlawful conduct,directed at his prospective
employer might indicate the applicant’s lack of responsible
attitude toward performing work for that employer," but it
didn't say it had to be job-related.
be job-related.
Q

It didn't say it had to

It *jas not a Griggs decision.

It doesn't have to indicate an irresponsible attitude

toward his work.
MR. GILDEN:

Right, right.

And I think the reason they are saying that, Your

30
Honor, is this, that I think. -Q

McDonnell must demonstrate that or they must hire

him?

MR. GILDEN:
Q

Well, 1 would say —

Isn't that right?
MR. GXLDEN:

Yes, that's right.

I would say that the stall in would be a basis for
a trial judge to consider in the totality of the evidence before
it, as to whether or not racial discrimination was the reason
that Green wasn't hired in July of 1965, or whether the stall
in in October of 1964, when there was no Equal Employment
Opportunity Act, was the basis.
And the court was sending this matter back for
what the real reasons were, whether the reasons were pretextual

Q

Would it be enough if the company showed — showed

and everybody accepted — that the reason he was fired was
because he participated in the stall in?

MR. GXLBEEf:

If that were the only fact, Your Honor?

I would say that could be a basis for not hiring,

If that were the only fact.

yes.

If that were the only fact,

the only fact before the District Court.
But the court contemplated —

Q

I know but that wouldn't necessarily show that --

or maybe not even intimate that he had an irresponsible attitude.

31
MR. GILDEN:

Well, I would say that the court would

make a decision based upon the guidelines and standards set
forth in the opinion, as to whether the question of a stall
in

against an employer complaining about racial discrimination

in the plant in October of 1964 would be an irresponsible
attitude toward his employer for the type of illegal protest
he was engaged in.
And that's the determination the court would make,
the District Court would make, based upon the facts before it,
Q

Focusing on that same language where the court said,

"However,"

this is in the revised opinion, "an applicant's

past participation in unlawful conduct directed at his
prospective employer might indicate the applicant's lack of a
responsible attitude."
Where do you find -- what do you find in the statute
that says that the employer might consider that?
MR. GILDEN:

Well, Your Honor, I think — you know,

this is a double-edge sword.

They — McDonnell — I would say

it is not in the statute. This is mere dictum in the court,
in the court's decision.

The basic decision relates to whether

or not Green had to have a reasonable cause finding as a
statutory prerequisite to the insitution of an action.
That's the only decision before the Eighth Circuit.
This is mere dictum.
Q

When you say that's dictum, do you mean the District

32
Judge can completely Ignore it?
MR. GXLDEN:

Well, I would say he would think about

the guidelines set out by the Eighth Circuit, but it is
dictum.
Q

It is not the rule of the case.
It is pretty pointed dictum, isn't it?
MR. GILDEN:

It is pretty pointed, yes.

And I

would say that a District Court would do well to submit to
those guidelines.

And I submit that based upon these facts,

based upon the facts submitted before the Appellate Court, that
these guidelines would be appropriate.

Because the court was

well aware of what evidence had been submitted on the 704(a)
issue, and based upon these guidelines that would be appropriate.
I submit that the two questions that have been
presented to this Court today aren't even rules of this case,
the question of whether a Black man can be denied employment
if he engages in civil rights protest, under Title 7, and the
question of subjective evidence.

There is nothing in any of

the decision which would keep Me Donne1 Douglas from submitting
subjective evidence before the trial judge, if that's all they
had.
And I might state for this Court — and this Court
well knows — that if I come into court,as Mr. Crone did, in
a trial and said, "I don't discriminate against Blacks," what
kind of a statement is that?
That's not objective.

That's a subjective statement.

33
What the court is saying in subjective criteria is
a mere, sore of declaration about your own integrity and your
virtue and your honesty, I do not discriminate against Blacks,
that kind of declaiming about your — how virtuous you are and
honest you are and hew good a person you are.

That is

subjective evidence.
But when you come in and say that somebody engages
in some activity or behavior, that would be something objective.
The court never said the stall in was not objective.
Q

Judge Thompson thought the District Court was going

to have some problems with frying to figure out just what was
the holding and what was the dictum and what was guideline,
didn't he?
MR. CILDEN:

1 think Judge Thompson was still relating

to the excised opinion, Your Honor.

He was still going into

job performance in his second dissenting opinion, and I think
had he read the decision a little more closely he would have
come to the decision that the question, of Griggs was not before
the court, the question of job performance was not before the
court, and that the court had carefully laid down very, very
accurate and very precise standards for the District Court to
be guided by.
I submit that there is only one issue and I have
been kept from my discovery — the discovery on race as to
McDonnell Douglas is engaged in racially discriminatory practices.

34
I haven’t had that trial.

It hasn’t been tried.

I submit that C4reen should have that trial.

He

should have an opportunity to show that the reasons given were
pretextual.

He should have an opportunity to show the broad

statistics, if there are any — and I assume there might be
in view of what happened and which I have informed the Court
about — about the racially discriminatory hiring practices
at McDonnell Douglas.
And based upon that, I hope to prevail in District
Court again, if this Court gives me that opportunity.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Gilden.

You have about three minutes left, Mr. Riddle.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VERYL RIDDLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RIDDLE: Mr. Chief Justice, I pain to have to
correct brother counsel, here, on the F-15 contract, which he
mentioned to the Court and acknowledge that it was not in the
record.
The fact of the matter is that that contract lias
been awarded to McDonnell Douglas, and all of the orders made
with respect to equal opportunity employment have been complied
with in conformance with the Executive Orders for quite some
time.
I pain to have to deny that off the record comment.

35
I would say, In closing, to this Courts that this law,
Title 7, has been tremendously beneficial in achieving the
objectives identified by Congress, and a lot of lawsuits have
been filed at the District Courts throughout the country, and
the Act has, I think, been a success, a remarkable success.
This case, particular case, as a result of the
opinion from the Eighth Circuit, has created a lot of questions
and has caused a lot of concern by members of the bar, by
District Courts, and by employers and employees as well.
I think that because of the complete reversal of the
traditional principles that are involved in trying this issue
where the only issue ever is to determine the real reason
why a person is refused employment, discharged from employment,
or other action or relations that he has with his employer,
and to get at the real issue in the traditional sense, courts
have done a good job and they will continue to do a good job.
I think that there is nothing at all, nothing in the
law, there is just nothing at all in the decisions in the past
where you have a one on one, an individual employer -- or an
individual applicant making an application for a job.

And

this decision, if it is followed, and conscientious District
Courts are going to try to follow it — for them to try this
the law will be turned on its head.
And I submit for those reasons that the case clearly
should be reversed and we think it ought to go back with an

36
order from this Court that the judgment of the trial court
who heard the evidence, and who concluded that this sort of
unlawful conduct was not protected and it would form an
abundant basis for refusal to employ any person.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Riddle.

Thank you, gentlemen.
