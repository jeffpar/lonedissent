Mrs. M~urninq refused to make anv naVT'IP.nts undPr thP
contract after the initial down oaVllU'!nt.
On nrc mber 16th, 1Q69, defendant sent "rs, "nurninq
the first of at least eight dunninq letter!!, all of which are
set out on pages 14 to 21 of the printed Appendix.

~he

fir~t letter stated that FPS had had ~rs, ~ourninq's suhscrintions enter d for the entire fivc-vear period, and hPr contract
c0ul~ not be cancelled.
On necemher 28th of that year, FPS sent ~rs.
Mcurninq a nccond lrtter, etating that P'PS had paid for the
maqazineo in advance and that l'rs. ~,ourninq had incurren an
ohligation to repay PPS.
Th~ lett~r also stated:

"This is a cr~dit account,

and as such must be repaid hv you on a 1110nthlv hasin, much thP

7

same as if vou had purchased anv other type of monthlv -any other type of merchandi'le on a monthtv hudqet olan,"
On April 23rd, 1970, ~ra. Mourninq hrouqht this action
in the District Court for the Southern Oistrict of Florida,
suing to enfo~ce the Truth in Lending Act.

Federal ;urisdic-

tion to enforce the statute is eXJ>rcssly conferred upon thP
district courts by Section 1640 of the statute.
Hr. Mourninq, in her aroondcd complaint, alleqed
that the ~ontract with FPS was a credit transaction covP.red
by the Truth in Lending Act, and that the disclosures require~
by the Act had not been made,
Plaintiff souqht statutory darnaqe of $100 plus leqal
fccJ and costs.
FPS, in its answer, asserted three defenses relevant
here:

FPS urqed, first, that none of the disclosu~ provisions

of •·ho Act

pply to this transaction, because the contract

did not ;nvolve a finance charqe1 ns a second defense, FPS
a sorted ~hat the Act did not apply to tho contract because
oP<;

had not extended credit to 1-(re, •tourninq,
Firally, PPS maintained that even if the contract

were covered by the Act, neither ~rs. Mourninq nor anv othPr
co~su: r could enforce tho statute hecause FPS had not
i ,os o a fin nc~ charge under this tyPC of contract.
FPS conCE">des, however, thnt it

not make thP

i!lclosurPn which plaintiff' claims are leqallv rP.quiren.

R

On Octcber 10th, 1970, the diRtrict c~urt qranteo
Mrs. ~ournlnq's motior for s\ll11111ary iu~qmert.

That court ruleo

that the tranraction was oubject to the Truth in Lendinq
di~closurc rc,quir ~ents, hecause the purchase Price was pavahle
in 11\0rc than four installments.
Th~ district court upheld and applied the four-

install111ent rule, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board,
which requires that disclosures be made to cons\ll!lcrs in any
transaction involving more than four installments, without
rogarc to whether or not a finance charge is proven to have
been imposed.
The district court also held that the instant
con~ract involved the extension of credit hv FPS to ~rs.
~ourning.
JudCllll'nt was entered on bchalF of the Plaintiff in
ttc amount of $100 plus costs and attorney fees.
Tho Court o# Appeals reversed on appeal and ordereo
the complaint dismissed.
In an opinion by Judge Coleman, the court of Appealq
ugrced that the four-installment rule reqnired FPS to make the
disclo ures withheld in this case.

But the Court of Appeals

held that th t rule was invalid, b cause it was not within the
Federal Reo<rve Board'R power to promulgate requlations under
th~ Act.
The Court of Appeulo alno held that the fnur-install-

mcnt rule was unconstitutional because it constituted a
con~lusive presumption that all transactions with more than
four installments involved a hioden finance charqe.
Th~ Court of Appeals did not rule on the twn
additional defenses raised by FPS in the oiRtrict court.
A writ of certiorari was souqht in this Court to
review tho decision of the Fifth Circuit, invalidatinq the
four-installment rule.
FPS did not urge in the proceedinqs helo-~ that the
four-installment rule was unconstitutional, and e,cpresslv
does ~ot rely on that ground before this Court.
PPS does arquc, however, that the four-installment
regulation exceeded th

Board's rul makinq authoritv under

the Truth in Lending Act.
The statute involved was enacted in 1968, with the
express purpo e of giving to consumers a meaninqful diRclosure
of er dit terms, so that the consnrnor would he ahle to eomoare
more

I

adily the various credit terms availahle to him, and to

avoid the uninformed use of credit.
The statute arose out of seven vears of hearinqs and
cow.mittco findinqs that consumers were qenerally unawal"f! of
the t rms of their loans, contracts, and other credit
transactions.
Th

leqislative history revealed that cre~itors

qenerallv withheld vital information, and that thP. valu~ of

10

what wari disclosed was often impaired bv widelv disparate
terminology and accounting methods.
In addition to the expressly stated puroose auoted,
and contained in Section 1601 of the Act, Section 1604 of the
statute specifically authorized the Federal Reserve Board to
prorrulgate whatev~r roaulations it miqht dt'tlra neceqsarv or
proper to effectuate th~ purposes of the statute.
In addition to deleqatinq this qeneral recrnlatorv
responsibility to the Board, Conqress also enacted a numher
of

!X'>Cifio ~rovisionn requiring several disclosureq under

variou

ciroumstances.

The,e disclosures include purchase price

of goods, th~ aniount to be paid after the d0tm oavinent, the
finance c~arge involved, and t~e annual interest rate of
fincnce charq, expressed as a porcentaqe.
Tho statute and requlations also reauire that

standardized ~ernunology be used to facilitate c0ll10arison of
various contracts.
Somo of the problems as to how the purpose of
meaningful disclosu:rf' would ~o achieved were dealt with in

And also mandatPd enforc:ernent of thP. statutPand r qulations by various federal aqQncies.
The fourt-i~stallmer-t rule, whose validitv is at
issue, i

con~ained in 12 c-~, Section 226.2(k), and is set

out on paqe 4 of petitioner's brief.
Tho Fff ct of the rul~ is to rcquirP- that disclosureR
be made to consUillerR in any credit transactions oayahlP. in
mor

th.:u-. four installments, reqordless of whother the

cn-ditor ~d:'li

tn lmposinq a financ

charqa in that trans-

ction or oth~ ••
In the inst.int cacc, the four-installment rule would
haw, required a minimum that FPS disclose to Mrs. Mourninq
the total price o~ th~

aqazines and the amount w~ich she

still owed FPS afte~ he initial down payment.
QUESTION: The total was a hundred and t,fenty-two -MR. SCITNAPPEF:

$122.45.

Whether the Federal Reserve Board's fourinstallment rule is valid turno upon whether it was within the
Board's e~pre~s authority to promulqate requlations as set
ouc i.r. tho Truth in ~,endinq Act itself.
The authority of tho Board is defined in
~ection 1604 of the s·atute, reproduced on paqeR 3 and 4 of
petitioner's bri~f.
That section provides:

•The Board shall orescrihe

requl tlons to carry out the purposes of thin suhchapter.

12

These requlations
dif

av contain ouch clas 1fications,

renti tion , or other provisiong, and mav provide for such

adjustments or oxc ption~ for any cluss of tran~actionR,
as in the judcp.: nt of the Board arc nee "sary or pr~r to

effectua~o th

pur->oscs of this su~chapter, to orevent

circur:ivention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance
thorc,with.'
Tllo four-in~tallment rule is necessarv, first, to

prevent ~vasion of th

s ction 1638 of th

substantive raauirement contained in

Act that creditors disclose to conc=rs

the finance charge and annual interest rate imposed in anv
crcdl

transaction.
In the norm.'.11 credit sale with which we're familiar,

the ICC!rchant imposen on

charqe for the purpose of

qoodg

for

cash, and i11IPOses an ad:iltional separate charqe for the
privileg

of paying for the goods over an extended oeriod of

tim.
Con rs
th
of t

was particularlv concomed, however, that

ount of this flnarce charge miqht be hidden in the price
I

goods the

elves.

dang r w s verv real.

The Board concluded that such a

Th ir concern was, for example, that

instead of charging $100 for a television set, and $20 for the
privilege of paying for it over two years, a rnerchant would charq1
$120 for the t lovision set and inform the consuoer that the
credit was frc.

13

Such a merchant would naturallv a11AP.rt that the
ru:nual intere t rate involvei was zero.

This would not

merely leave consumers uninformed, but would create a false
illusion that th - 1nerchant • & credit was siqnificantly les11
expensive than the credit of lenders such as banks, which have
no prices in which they can bury their finance charqes.
The congressional hearings indicated that

baring

finance charges and prices was a problem even before the
statute was enacted, nnd a report to Congress by the Federal
Trade Commies on indicated that this practice of hiding
finance charge& and prices was particularly common in urban
qhettoc,;.
Rattor than pomit retailers to thus render the
Truth in Lendinq Act requirement of disclosure of finance
change~ a dead letter, the Federal Reserve Board promulgated
the four-installment rule.

The key effect of this rule is

to require a crc-ditor who may claim he imposes no finance

chaiges to nonetheless disclose at the very least the total
pric.., of the good•· involve" in any transaction pavahle in
more than four in talllr.ents.
•h

Board apparently reasoned, as had supparters of

the statute while it wao being considered by the Conqraes,
that ~f consumer~ were at leant told the total Price of an
item, they could compare that price with other prices and
determine if

merchant were charging more than the normal

14

amount.

QUESTION:

But ohe would always, she would --

Both under the statute and bv ordinary

economic, in dictionary definitional terms, she was the one
who was the creditor, wasn't she?
MR. SCHNAPPEPi Well, we believe not, because under
the realitic, of tJ-.n transaction, while she paid for
maqaz ncs beforc- she qot them, she paid for them after FPS
had paid out money to the publishers, so that she had a deht
to FPS to cov.r the money that they had laid out.
QUESTION:

And that --

So she couldn't have qotten the

mug zinc~ from the publisher except by pavinq the full
subscription price in advanre?

MR. SCHNAPPER: That's also correct.

That's the

normal practice in the industry.
QUESTION :

to her and loaned it -- and you say loaned it to her, reallv?
~R. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think our economic analvsis

to buy the subscription and she paid them back.

QUESTION:

Well, we think --

It doesn't make any difference.

MR. SCHNAPPER· We say it doesn't make any difference
und!'r the regulation,
QUESTION: Right.
SCHNAPPER:

That's correct.

The four-installment rule is also necessarv to prevent
evasion of the other dicclosure requirements of the statute.
In addition to requiring disclosure of finance charqeA, the
statute rEquires the disclosure of a host of other credit
terms: ti,

a1110unt finuncad, the prico of the goods, the time

and number of payments.
If, however, a creditor asserts in his contract that
h

dos not impose a finance charge, a serious question arises

21

under the faca of the statute, as to whetrer or not the
creditor n ed disclose anythinq to consumers, or whether, hv
having first hidden his finance charqe, in evadinq the
requirement t~at that be disclosed, he can t~en turn around
and evade all the other requirements of the statute and claim
a complete exemption.

Th

four-installment rule precludes this type of

circumvention as well.

The regulation provides that the usual

disclosures must bo made in any transaction involvinq finance
charges, but also in any transaction in which more than four
installments are involv d.
The rule thuc not only prevents circumvention of the
Act in this way, but it effectuates the expressly stated
purpose of th~ Act to provide consumaro with credit tems of
their transactions.
Congress expr ssly delegated to the Pederal Reserve
Board the res-ponsibilitv for dccidinq when there was a danger
of evasion and for fashioninq a remedy to he evolved to deal
with that danger.
Tho Boo.rd's expertise in understandinq tho statute
goes back to many years before its actual enactment, hecause
the Board wa
th

intimately involved in tho process of drafting

statute, through t~e co~qressional hearinqs.
After the draft requlations were proi,osed, and more

than 1200 comments con~idered, and subsequent to consideration

22

of them, the Pede al R erve Doard promulqated the fourinstallment rule in its present form.
That rule has remained in effect, despite three years
of experience, reflectinq the Board's judgment that it is
operative and effectuatca t~o purposes for which it was
designed.
The judgmc,nt and c>roerti e of an aqency Auch as thP.

of the

tatut

and churqed with th

framinq

responsibility of settina

its machinery in motion, and of m.iking the parts work
efficiently and smoothly while they are yet new 2.nd untried,
is entitled to great deference.
At issue in this case is not an ancillary requlation
of minor significance, but a rule which tho Federal Reserve
Board has found vital to preventing wholesale evasion of the
Act.

trimonctions.
The Boarci has further projected that tht nc.mher of
creditors thu

hiding their finance charqes will increase, as

a reoult of the promulgation of the statute, and that the
effect of the sta~utc will thus be to decrease rather than
incr" e the '1Jllount of information which consumerA qr.t.

23

The legislative history of the atatute indicate~
thot the burden of this decrease in disclo.-iure uill fall
particularly heavily uPOn the poor.
In sharp contrast to these consecruences, creditors
such as ~Jllj.ly Publication Service will suffer no seriouR
inconve.nience if they're required to make oiecloRures and
ccmply with the four-installment rule.

xtent in advance, one letter suqqested thev

ted in her contract, which suqqests that thev
thing completely.

The letters indicate at the very least that thev
had prepaid the publishers to some extent from their own funds,
and that ~he ow~d theM money to repay them, and the word "repay"
is used in the letters, for expenditureE t~ey had already made.
Now, if, for example, she had dealt with a bank and
borrowed $122 and paid it to the maqnzine company, it would
9till be the case that she was recriving maqazines only after
she had put rut money to th~ bank.
But the fact of the matter is that that would
clearly be a credit transaction, because the lender involvAd
would have parted with value, not to her but to the mogazine
company, prior to recc,ivinq it hack from her.
QUE TION: Wrll, what I'm tryinq to suggest is to
ask whether there is a finance charge in FPS's use of her

Mr. C'hief Justice, ant1 mav it please

tho Court:
First I'd like to answer Mr. Juntice Blackmun'R
question about the pending legislation.
That is pointed out on page 6 of the qovernrnent's

What happened to the leqislation was

thnt it passed the Senate.

The leqislation essentially

enact d as an mnendment to tho Act, the four-installment rule
that's in issue in this case7 the legislation did pass the
Senate, but it was not reported out of the House Banltinq and
Currency Committee in time before Conqress adjourned.

So the

legislation his essentially diedfor this term.
The other question I'd like to address myself to:
at th

boqinnLnq is Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question with

regard to

videnco in the case as to what the publishers•

charge for these magazine subocriptions would have been.
I take it that question is directed to determining
whether in fa~ there's a buried finance charqe in this
tran action.

30

The proper comparison, ~r. Chief Justice, I would
submit, would be not what the publi.shers charqe hut- what Family
Publication

would have charged a cash customer, a person

that was willing to pay the entire amount on line when they
contrected for the maqazines, as O">t>Osed to uhat they charqe

component of that selling price is cost of credit.

It's just

part of the cost of doing business, which is always in the
selling price.

And when you get beyond that, then you get a

profit.
I might add that during the hearings, on page 15 of
our brief, in footnote 14, we mentioned a statement by
Senator Proxmire, which says, ''I see, then what you are saying
is that at Foves you don't pay a carrying charqe of any kind •

••• obviously what Poyen is doing is burying the charge in
the cost of tho mcrchlllldise."
counoel for FPS has stated that a few seconds later

49

Senator Proxmire said, "Oh, apparently you're not charging a
finance charge for this merchandise" or that Foyes wasn't.
I would direct the Court's attention -- I'm not sure
where that is in their brief -- to the testi1110ny that
preceded Senator Proxmire's statement, because what he was
told was that Foyes went out of business with respect to this
merchandise.

Hie reply was, "Oh, they weren't charging a

finance charge.•

I think there wac a touch of sarcasm in

that resi;onse.

Mr. Randolph, are you saying, then, that

This is

In the

legislative h ..story there is, in both the Bouse and Senate
n Jorts, the statemen~ that the reason Congreos required or
said

didn't want to cover 30, 60, 90-day accounts or trade
accounts, because they consider them essentially cash
transactions.

the Board did consider a

not, why woul n't the same be true for a two-installment sale?
• I.U\NDOLPH :

'l'he next aection, the next critically operative
section
Mr. Rifkind,

QUE '1'10~ 1

MR. RIFKIUO1
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- you

111Gan

a finance charge which is

identified as such or a finance charge which is determined to
be present as a matter of economic reality?
HR. lUP'KIND:

11e llubmit that the Act does not

distinguish between identified and unidentified finance
charges, hidden or patent finance charges: it says "finance
charqeu imposed by a creditor must in all circumstances be
disclosed."

Without question.

Now, I add the proposition, that Congrecs did not
share the Solicitor General's view or the Federal Reserve
Board's view, that every creditor impose a finance charge in
some mnbient economic sense.
First of all, there's no law guarantees that you're
going to stay in business, as Foyoo discovered.

People do not

always recover their costs from their customers.
But there is a more simple situation.

A patient comes

to a doctor, hes a major operation, and the doctor says, "Well,
my

fee for removing your appendix ia $2,000.

I know you

55

can't pay me ,·or it now: pay me $100 a week for the next 20
weeks."
Now, no one in his right mind, I think, supposes
that that doctor is imposing a finance charge.

But the Federal

lleservo Board says he is subject to the four-inutallment rule.
The doctor, of course, has a cost of business, he
has top y his tclophone operator, his nurse, buy a stethoscope,
and do whatev r doctors do.
QOISTIO?J:

But you think it would not be relevant if

it could be demonDtrated, in an attack on that transaction,
that in fact ~11 other patients who paid cash or within 90
days wero charged $1,000?
MR. RIFKIND:

Oh, I quite agree.

If it is shown

that the normal price of this doctor or his contemporaries
for an appectomy is a thousand dollars, but he charged two
thou and dollars for letting a patient pay for it over two
years, I think you'd prove a finance charge just as simply
as that,

Ana I -- if the Board wants to regulate that, I

havo no problem with that all.

I think the Act regulates it,

and requires the doctor to disclose under those circumstances.
All I'm saying there are in fact, in practical
exp riences,

e all knou situations in which the fee, the

charge, the c~st imposed on the customer does not in fact
vary with deferment of payments.
And at least --

56

QUESTION:
however, it does.

But as a matter of economic reality,
I meen, two thousand dollars over twenty

weeks is less money than two thousand dollars cash in hand.
Everybody that's ever studied elementary economics knows that.
MR. RIFKIND: That is, that the seller experiences a
cost.
QUESTION: That'& right.
MR. RIFl<IND1 Which he l!lay or may not pass on.
QUESTION: Which he may or may not even realize.
)lR. RIFKIND:

Which he may not realize, and he may

or may not impose on his customers.
QUESTION:

I mean just as there are naive buyers,

there are naive sellers, too.
MR. RIFKIND: That is truo.
Now, I turn to Section 1631(a) of the Act, which is
at page 6a of our Appendix in the blue brief, and this is the
Genorol Disclosure requirement.

It says that •Each creditor"

-- we have already defined "creditor" to mean creditors who
regularly impose finance charges: each such creditor, in
accordance with rcgulntions prescribed by the Board,•shall
disclose to each person to whom credit is extended and upon
whom a finance charge is or may be imposed, the information
required under this pa::t,"
so, not only do you start with a class of creditors
who impose financ~ chorWJes, you go on to those transactions

57

in which they in fact impose them, as Congress wrote it.
Now, t'd like to say a word about "may be• there.
There has been some temptation, I think, in the briefs for
the government and petitioner, to suppose that "may be" means
"maybe"; pexhaps it's thare, perhaps it isn't.

It clearly

doesn't mean that.
Th

word "may" is defined in the Act, it's not

c rried f<•rward into tho code except 1n a footnote; "may" is

And the annual percentage

And you're suppo~ed to do it precisely.
No one has given us any clue as to how, if their

economic theory, not shared by Congress, is correct, how we

60

are oupposed to ascertain it.

What we have been told is

that the Federal Reterve Board doesn't know how to ascertain
it, and that the w~ole committee of Congress who composed
these regulations didn't know how to do it.
But we must, in hundreds of thousands of transactions
each yeur, do it at peril of liability of a hundred dollars to
every customer, and a criminal liability.
Now, lt is true the Federal Reserve Board has
suggested, not by regulation but rather informally, and it's
in the 6olicitor General's brief, they said, Well, maybe you
don't have to disclose the finance charge and the
percent g

rate, after all, if it's hard to do.
How that waiver of the requirements of the Act

fu~thers the purposes of the Act as having brought within the
ambit of the Act a large class of people who everybne thought
didn't have

n~c charges, and then say, Well, you don't

have to disclose your finance charges after all.

How that

furt..,ers the purpose of disclosure of credit terms, I don't
really see.

But whether or not the statement by the Board

that you don't have to make those disclosures would bind
Mrs. Mourning in her suit or any of the other people who have
brought suit, or, indeed, would bind any grand jury that wanted
to begin criminal proceedings under this Act, I don't know.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought, Mr. Rifkind, that it

was not, at least, clear, beletedly, that had it been an

total cash.
MR. RIFKIND:

Isn't that right?

and (7), subsection (7) of 1638(a) -- subsection

(6), Im an, says that the finance charge may be designated
as a t1J11e-prioe differential.
So, to that extent, it would not be impossible or
an =realiLtic requirement, would it?
MR. RIFKIND:

If we had a time-price differential,

that 1G correct.
QUESTION: Well, then, -MR. RIFKIND:

I will get to that in just a second.

QUESTION:

if I misunderstood that.

MR. RIFKIND:

Just to finish with the Act, and I

Yes.

h ve j~st one last section to call your attention to, the
Act, the oection under uhich this suit actually arises,
1640, finally wrups it all up by saying that if you violate
it, if you fa.l to make the disclosures, the liability imposed

is twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with
the tranG ction.
The Congres~ apparently thought that the finance

62

charge w~s there and thut it was sufficiently ascertainable
to be used as a convcni~nt measuring rod for the, really,
penalty; it's not a compensatory -- it isn't damages, it's a
penalty.
QUESTION:

Well, it isn't a very big penalty under

these circlll!lstances, is it?
MR. RIFKIND1

If you multiply it by 250,000

customer~, it is a staggering penalty.
QUESTION: Well, such as what amount?

Have you

suggested the mno11nt in your brief, other than saying it was
a staggering amount?

nR.

RIFI<IND: Well, they say that they're entitled

to the minimUD amount of $100 per person: and 250,000 customers
as year, that's $25 million.
QUESTION:

Congress certainly was capable of making

that calculation, was it not?
MR. RIFKINO:

Yes.

It's something like treble damages in

Let me go now to what you were raising, Mr. Justice
Stewart.

our footnote concerning our discovery, quite late

in the day, I c-oncede -- as a matter of fact, after the

63

selling operations that Family had closed down, that in some
few instances there was indication that some customers who
paid cash did not pay the full price.
I thought candor required me to call that to the
Court's attention.
Th

l think it is also totally irrelevant,

complaint in this action, indeed, the second

amended complaint does not allege that there was a finance
charge.

The case was presented in the district court on the

plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the proposition
that it didn't make any difference whether there was a finance
charge or not, and the plaintiff had no interest in proving
it, because she relied entirely on Regulation z.
The district court didn't find that there was a
finance charge: the Court of Appeals didn't find that there
was a finance charqe, and I don't think, at this stage in the
game, the plaintiff can now rely on the proposition that
maybe there was a finance charge there.

That isn't the case·

that's presented.
I will say that if there were a finance charge in
tie transaction, Regulation z is wholly irrelevant.

We're

clearly responsible to disclose it, and liable.
QUESTION:

Is it also clear that there was an

extension of credit?
UR. RIFKIND: To me it is perfectly clear that there
was not.

64

QUES'l'IOH: What did the district court say?

Anything?

MR. RIFKIND: The district court said that the
letters "Written after the contract, the dunning letters written
to Mrs. Mourning evidenced that it was credit, that the non-

cancellable provisiont of the contract, the statement that
the cortract was non-cancellable made it a credit transaction,
and -- there was one other ground -- that the -- well, I think
thoue are cx<mplary of the grounds he went on.
fie certainly did not rely on the proposition that
Fl.'S, Family Publications Service, had incurred costs and
paid money to publishers, which there is nothing in the
record to support except these dunning letters.
QUESTION: Did the district court say that the
defendant has extended consumer credit within the meaning of
the Truth in Lending Act?
MR. RIFKIND:
Qt:STION:

Yes, he did.

Is that a finding, or not?

MR. RIFKIND:

I think that's a conclusion of law.

QUESTION: Well, he decided, he concluded -- whatever
you want to C311 it -- anyway.
MR. RIFKIND:

QUESTION: Well, the answer is yes, then?
MR. IUFKIND:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And so there were -- end the court did

enter summary judgment?
MR. RIFKIND: That is correct.
QUESTION: And in the course of that, he said that?
MR. RIFKIND:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, did the Court of Appeals do anything

about that?
MR. RIFKIND:
~he ques~ion.

The Court of Appeals did not reach

As all the parties here agree.

QUESTION:

So what should -- are you suggesting

that we should decide the case on the basis that there wasn't
a credit tran.;action?
MR. RIFKIND:

I think that, since the only document

that ic relevant is a document that all of the parties, I
think, conceded is an unambiguous contract.

That is, that is

what tells you whether it's a credit transaction as a matter
of law or not.

That this ~ourt could readily proceed to

d~termine that this was not a credit transaction.

66

QUESTION:

Because the requlation certainly doesn't

make it irrelevant es to whether there was a credit transaction.
MR, RIFKIND:
QUESTION:

Well, --

It does with respect to the finance

charqe.
MR. RIFKIND:

It does, and I must say, as I read

some of the opinions that have been issued by the Federal
Reserve Board, they seem to be reading out the credit
requirement of the Act as well.
QUESTION:

The regulation doesn't seem to.

MR. RIFKIND:

Not the regulation, it's more the

regulation as applied, that leads to readinq it out.

Because wha

they keep saying that they're interested in is disclosing the
sum total of installment payments.

And they have gone after

get.ing the statement of the sum of installment payments to
bo disclosed.
But installment agreements -- not all installment
agreements -- are credit agreements.
funJa.'llElntal.

That's perfectly

And I think the Federal Reserve Board has lost

track of that.
An example was given in one of the hearings.

QUESTION: But maybe not in this case.
MR. RIFKIND:
this case, too.

I think they have lost track of it in

I should say that the government below

67

declined to take a position on whether there was credit here.
And expressed no opinion at all in its mnicus participation
in the Fifth Circuit.
Perhaps that was why the Fifth Circuit never reached
the question.
I'm not quite clear on what position they take on
the credit question here.
It seems to me quite clear, if you look at the
opinions, the opinion letters that the Board has issued, that
tney ar~ reading out, di~inishing the requirement of credit
in these installment contracts.

Now, that's the underlying

rationale of what they're trying to do here.

They keep telling

us, You don't have to disclose the finance charge: that would
be too hard.

But what you have to disclose is the sum total

of installnlent payments.
QUESTION:

'1'1as there an objection to deciding the

case on summary judgment?
MR. RIFKIND:

No, there were cross-motions for

sUll1Illary j11dqm nt.
QUESTION: Well, wasn't one of the relevant questions
in the case whether or not there was a credit transaction?
MR. RIFKIND:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: But you say that was a legal, really a
leqal question on which you couldn't find any more facts other
th11n the contract?

68

MR. RIFKIND:
QUESTION,

Yes.

And the letters, maybe.

MR. RIFKIND:

That's right.

It seems to me that the

contract, on its face, is really the answer to whether or not
it is. And that's what the district judge thought, too.

He

said the acceleration clause,-- which is the third ground I
had forgotten before -- the non-cancellsble provision, and
perhaps also tho dunning letters, ceme together to support that
conclusion.
QUESTION: Well, wouldn't it have been rather relevant
on that question to know what the arrangements were between
Family Publications and the publishers?
MR. RIFKIND:

No, I don't -- I don't think so,

QUESTION: Well, let us assume for the It10111ent that
they actually had paid the publishers a

B\llll

of t!IOney, on

behalf of the customer.
MR. RIFKIND:

I would think that when I go to buy a

car on time from a General Motors dealer, it really, whether
my relationship with him is a credit relationship, doesn't
depend upon whether he has already bought the car from General
Motors and ha~ been holding it, or he plans to buy it in the
future from General Motors,

It seems to me the question is,

is he extending me credit, not what he's doing with his money,
and how he raises his money.
QUESTION: Well, it certainly -- I mean, otherwise

69

you would think, as Mr. Justice Stewart or someone else
brought out, it might be that the buyer was extending credit
to the publisher, paying in advance for a service,
MR. RIPKIND: The buyer is extending credit to the
publisher; that is exactly what is happening here.
QUESTION:

Well, not if the intermediary, Family

Publications, has already paid the publisher.

That's why I

say the fact -- that that might be a very relevant fact.
MR. lUFKIND:
QUESTION:

The district court didn't --

But if it was a failure in that regard

about the facts, you say it must be on the plaintiff's side
and not yours?
MR. RIFKIND: Well, our answer to the complaint did
say:

at no point during the life of the contract has defendant,

FPS, paid money to a third person or supplied goods or services
to the customer for which reimbursement is expected from the
customer in the future.
The fact of the matter is that we paid the
magazine publishers after we received payment from the
customer.

Now, that 1s not clearly established in the record,

The district court thought it was irrelevant and not necessary
to its conclusion, an~ I think the grounds on which the
district court r lied are legal error.
QUESTION:

Assuming that I buy everything you say

up to tho point of the fact that one she misses one payment

70

she's in trouble.

For example, if you only paid three dollars

a month for three one-dollar books, that might not be credit.
But if the contract provides that you must do that for three
years, and feilure to make one installment accelerates; isn't
that an entirely different ballgame?
MR. RIFKIND: ~1el l, Mr. Justice Mnrahall, one of the
reasono for the acceleration clause is precisely that we
did not care to become creditors.

We wanted to be paid in

advance.
QUESTION: All of it,
MR, RIF!tIND: We were willing to be paid at sort of
double the rate -QUESTION: Well, when the
MR. RIFKIND:

But if it fell into default we wanted

tho whole amount, because we didn't want to be sending magazines
top ople who had not paid us.
QUESTION, So that when they paid the whole amount,
would there be a credit relationship then?
MR. RIFKIND:
Mrs. Mourning's debt.

Yes, we would be substantially in
She would have paid us $122, and we

would have sent her thre3 years of magazines.
QUESTION: Well, isn't that in the original contract?
MR. RIFKIND: That is in the original contract.
It says
QUEtTION1 Well, why isn't that a contract of credit?

71

Since it's in the contract.
MR. RIFKIND: Well, if it's credit running from Mrs.
Mourning to u~, the Act doesn't apply because it only applies
to -- it only applies the other way around.
QUESTION:

I didn't aqree to that.

MR. RIFI<IND:

Yes.

That was you --

The answer is that it applies

only to consumer credit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rifkind, earlier, in your colloquy

with Mr. Justlce White, I thought I heard you say that on the
record as it now stands the Court was in a position -- this
Court was in a position to reach a determination that there
was no credit tran~actioni that was it, essentially?
MI<. RIFKIND:
QUESTION:

Yes.

On this record, could we reach the

contrary determination?
MR. RIFKIND:

I think that on this record it ought

at least to be remanded to the Fifth Circuit to consider the
question.

It seems to me there is a difference between affirm-

ing the Fifth Circuit on another ground that it didn't reach
and reversing it, on a ground that it didn't consider.
QUESTION:

Even if it's a pure question of law, that

would bo the -MR. RIFKIND:

I think it would be more conformable

to the normal pra~tice of the Court, in those circumstances,
to remand

it to the Fifth Circuit.

And maybe, in the last

72

analysis, you hav€ to remand it to the district court for an
evie ntiary examination of the question.
If I'm right that you can answer the question on the
face of the contract, it seems to me it can be answered here
as well as in any other court.
QUESTION: But isn't it rather strange for the Court
to figur€ that it must -- that it must invalidate the regulation unless it assumes that the fact that triggers the
regulation isn't present in the case?
MR, RIFKINO:

Oh, but I could see the Court saying

that it ought to have reached the credit argument first.
I think it was thrown off that nonnal course -QUESTION:

In the legislative hearings, I think the Chairman

committee:

suppose I hire my neighbor's son to come in each

73
dollar each Saturday after he's done it.

Is that a credit

trnnsaction?
And after a lot of legal talk, the answer was no.
There was no finance charge and there was no credit, as I
understand it.
That seems to me a perfectly normal, healthy
example of an installment arrangement in which both sides are
contractually obligated to continue rendering performance
over a substantial period of time, but not a credit
transaction, because
QUESTION:

Where is the enforcibility of this

lawn mowing operation, as compared with the enforcibility here?
MR. RIFKIND: Well, I suppose that the shrewd
youngster would say, "Now, Mr, Jones, before I agree to mow
your lnwn and forego mowing other people's lawns this
G'W11IOOr, I want you to write me a promise that you will pay
me a dollar every week.

I don't want you moving off to the

seashore and leaving me without a lawn to mow,"
QUESTION:

How long ago is that that somebody mowed

a lawn for a dollar?
(Laughter. 1
MR. RIFKIND:

I confess I don't have a lawn, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
The analogy to our case is:

I go to my newsstand

and aay to the -- maybe I'm on safer ground here -- and say

Now, we're bound, we may be bound for a year, tuo

years, whatever deal I make with him, but neither of us is

Now, if he was a canny newsdealer, as FPS was, and
said: "Look, how do I know you're goinq to come in.

MR, RIFKIND: There is nothing on the face of the

QUESTION:

But most of them have a regular stock

and make delivery, don I t they?

MR. RIFKIND: They do, but -QUESTION:

FPS has nothing except probably a

general understanding that when, as, and if they send in a
subscription with some money, on some terms, the contract
will then occur.
MR. lUPlCINO:

I think the key thing, though, is that

if the magazine doesn't get delivered, it's perfectly clear
that

FPS

is liable, not the magazine publisher.

This is not

a subscription with the magainze publisher, it is a subscription in which nll the riqhts flow from FPS to the customer.
And, indeed, serious problems have arisen where,
for example, the Saturday Evening Post or Look Magazine,
closes down.

It is a PDS, as it's called, paid during

service magazine sales organization that may well be left
holding the bag, unable to perform a contract which it undertook to perfonia.
'l'here is nothing, except for the fact that it says
that delivery will come from the publisher's office.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose your client either makes
D10ney from the finance charge or gets a discount from the
magazine.

You're not in business for nothing, are you?

76

MR. RIFI<IND:
QUESTION:

No, we're not a philanthropy.

So you're making money off of one end or

the other, either in your purchases or in your sales,

Certainly,

We charge customers more

than we are charged by the magazine publisher,

right,

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Mr. Rifkind, you suggested earlier

that there is no privity of contract between the

Mrs.

Mourning nnd the magazine; but if, promptly, as was contemplated,
after the making of this contract FPS did contract with the
magazines, would Mrs, Mourning be possibly a third-party
beneficiary who could enfo~ce that contract?

QUESTION:

I'm speaking 1ust in pure legal terms.

MR. RIFKIND1

Yes.

I think not, because, in fact,

the arrangements with tho magazine publisher are sort of in
bulk, not just, as I understand it, for Mrs. Mourning but for
some substantial group, whatever came in that week1 and I
don't know whether she has a pro rata interest in that, maybe
as a m_!llber of a class she does.

Similarly here, the fact that FPS doesn't have the
magazine or the newspaper in stock doeon't make FPS a bank,
in a relationship between Mrs. Mourning and Holiday.
I also think that -- I also urge that the Court may
feel that it has to reach the credit issue in all events
here because, assuming that the government's thesis that
somehow there's always a finance charge buried in credit
tran~actions, assuming that has any validity, the fourinstallment rule even under that theory could not logically
or rationally extend to non-credit situations.
Am'! if that's what they mean, they mean really to

all installment contract situations where there is no

78

necessary or logical implicit finance charge, then it seems
to me the rule has to be overbroad by all tests.
Thank vou very much.
