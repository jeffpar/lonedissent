MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will 'hear arguments

next in No. 71-6481, Davis against the United States.
Mr. Wulf, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WULF, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WULF:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleat-a the

Court:
This case which is here on a petition for
certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for thr
Fifth Circuit presents the question whether petitioner,

vhc

is a Negro, may challenge the exclusion of Blacks from the
federal grand jury which indicted him in a post-conviction
proceeding where the claim was not made before trial.

It

deals with the scope of Section 2255, the equivalent of
habeas corpus for federal prisoners.
The facts are that petitioner, who is Black, was
indicted for bank robbery in the Northern District of
Mississippi in January, 1S6S.

I5ls court-appointed counsel

appeared with him fox' arraignment several weeks afterwards
and was given 30 days for motions.
On March 6th the motions were filed, including a
motion to quash the indictment but only on the ground that
the arrest which led. to his indictment was illegal.
motion was denied.

That

The petitioner was

convicted by the jury and. sentenced to 14 years in jail—
Q

Was it a trial of him alone?

I notice there

MR. WtJLF:

There were two others.

They were severed.

So, this trial was of him alone?

MR. WULFs
Q

They were

Yes.

Thank you.

MR. WULF:

He was S€ tencet

to 14 years, and the

conviction was affirmed on appeal by the

Fifth Circuit.

And although it is not in the record, I do want to point out
that Davis was released on prole last August after serving
three years and 11 months of his sentence.
In January, 1971, Davis filed a motion under
Section 2255, alleging that Negroes were systematically
excluded from the grand jury which had handed down the
indictment against him, and he specifically rested on the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the relevant statutes in
Title 28 which then applied.
He also alleged that his attorney in fact had made
such a motion but, as appears from the opinions both of the
district court and the court of appeals, that does not appear
in the printed record.
on.

But I will return to that claim later

It is not terribly important at this stage.

5
At the same time that Davis- 0

Mr» MuIf, inasmuch as he made that objection,

then I take it that you must concede that he knew he had the
right to object to the composition of the grand jury before
trial»
MR. WULF:

All I will concede about his claim that

he made it is that he did not intend to raise it,,

And it

might also imply that he knew he had the right to make it.
But what would have to be gone into at the hearing on
remand, if there is a hearing on remand, would be what
reasons, if any, his .lawyer did not raise it if Davis had
in fact wanted him to raise it.

But that is an issue that

would really have to be canvassed, and it would go to the
whole waiver problem, which is the central issue in the
case.
At the same that he filed his 2255 motion, Davis
also filed a motion for discovery and inspection of facts
relating to the claimed exclusion of Blacks from the jury
selection system in the Northern District of California both
for the year 1968 and for the 20 years preceding.
The reply by the Government was in effect a general
denial which pointed out that he had not raised it before.
Trial was ostensibly required by Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, and also denied that any
exclusion was practiced in the district.

6
The district court, without.granting Davis a
hearing, dismissed writing an opinion, saying that his
having failed to raise it prior to trial as' required by
12(b)(2) and adhering to Shotwall that he had waived the
C laa

He also concluded that, in the language of the
rule, there is no cause shown to grant relief from the
waiver, and he made this finding also without having granted
any hearing.
The decision of the district court was affirmed
by the Sixth Circuit in a very brief curia opinion.

It tec

relied on Shotweli v. United States in its construction of
12(b)(2).
Q

Did you make any allegations in your 2255

petition as to why it was not raised?
MR. WOLF:

It was a pro se petition, Yen:: Honor.

Whafc he said was that it had been raised.
,in the petition.

He alleged that

He said that his court-appointed attorney

had made an oral motion before trial, but the district court
searched the record, read the transcript, said he could not
find any reference to that claim having been raised, and it
is at this point a disputed claim of fact which the district
court, as X say, found on the basis of his own recollection
and on the review of the-—
Q

Let us assume that issue were not in the case,

7
about whether it was raised or act, that it just was

not

raised»
ME. WULF:
Q

Yes.

Would you say that in & habeas corpus

petition or 2255 petition you should make sons allegation
either that I did not know or that even if I knew*, ti ere
was a reason for not raising it, so that you could create
grounds for having a hearing?
MR. WULF;

If those were the facts.

He said that

it had been raised, which certainly leads to the itplicci:lov:
that he intended .it to be raised—
Q

If that is all you alleged, that it was

raised, and the court determines on the basis of the record
that there is no real issue of fact, why should there be

•

hearing?
MR. WULF:

He also claimed. Your Honor, that he

did not waive it in the motion.
Q

All right* he claimed that he did not.

now we move to another issue.

Sc,

He says, "I did not waive

it."
MR, WULF:
Q

Yes.

Do you not suppose that he should say thy he

did not raise it?

Whose burden is it to show the presence

or lack of a deliberate bypass?
MR. WULFs

I think the original burden was or, the

8
Government, Your Honor»
Q

How about the 2255, the 2255 petition? who

has got to shoulder that burden?
MR. WULF:

Initially it is on the shoulders of the

petitioner.
/

Q

He did not even allege it.

MR, WULF:
Q
not say why.

But he did, if I may—

He just says, ”1 didn't waive it."

Ha did

Do you not suppose he ought to say why ha

did not?
MR. WULF:

He did not say why.

But it is ambiguous,

of course, because although he said he did not waive it, un­
supported that by saying that not only had he not waived
it but his lawyer had in fact raised it.

But whether or not

it can be proved that his lawyer raised it, there has to be
a hearing on the question of waiver, because that is always
a factual question.

It may be that his lawyer at the hearing

testified—the argument did raise it, in which case I think
we might still have some trouble with the application of
12(b)(2) because, even according to Davis, he did not raise
it before trial, he raised it after the motions were to be
filed.

But he could either testify that he raised it,

speaking of the lawyer or that he could not remember whether
or not it had been raised, or that he had not raised it and
then could himself testify about what kind of conversations,

9

if any, he had with Davis about the issue of jury
exclusion.

These, all require a hearing.
Q

I take it, then, you are saying that neither

are you in any position or willing to say even at this stage
why, if he did not raise it, why he did not?
MR. WULF:

I frankly do not know, Your Honor, why

he did not raise it.
Q

That is what I thought.

MR. WULF:

But I do not think the pro se petitioners

have to be held to a high art of pleading in these cases,
that if they make a Colorable showing on a constitutional
claim.and allege in general terms, even if they do not use
the word "waiver," even if they said it was not raised, I
would think that that should be adequate for purposes of
habeas reviev*.
Q

Assume it were perfectly clear from the

papers that he was represented by counsel and counsel knew
what the rule was and did not raise it; assume that.it is
clear from the record.
MR. WULF:
Q

Would you then 3ay automatically a hearing?

MR. WULF:
Q

Again, given the fact that—

Yes, yes, sir, I would.

You would have to, I mean, to maintain your

position.
MR. WULF:

I think as a matter of fact one would

10
have to.

Again, if one is not going to hold a petitioner,

pro ss petitioner, to a high art of pleading, I think that
on a colorable case, it is more or less something like a
prima facie case, that particularly where an important
constitutional right such as exclusion from juries is
concerned, that a district court should hold a hearing and
first deal, of course, with the factual question of waiver
and go into the question in order to complete the summary
allegations that are made in the complaint.
But I think it always has to be a factual question,
and I think it's a factual question which demands a hearing.
I suppose there are some cases where it might appear in the
pleadings themselves that if he said, "I discussed it with
my attorney and we agreed that as a strategic matter we were
not going to raise it now because I want to reserve it for
a post-conviction proceeding," that the judge would not have
to hold a hearing in that case,

But that may be the only

case that 2 can think of.
Q

I take if that you would say that if in a

criminal trial or in a civil trial, if you do not demand a
jury, that you can later say, rtI really did not intend to
waive it," and precipitate a hearing, even though you know
perfectly well that to get a jury you have to demand it.
MR , WULF:

I think that there vrould have to be a

factual question on the waiver there, yes.

But X would think

11
that that would appear on the record, on the face of the
record..
Q

So, it does not make any difference if the

rule says, and you know about it, that if you do not make
the demand, it shall be deemed waived*

That will not do any

good either.
MR* MJLF:

No.

That is what 12(b)(2) says, of

course.
Q

Exactly.

MR. WULF:
Q

That is right.

It does not make any difference, even though

you know that, and you know that, you do not raise it*
MR. WULF:
Q

Even though you knew it.

Yes, sir.

How would you distinguish that from the

hypothetical that you posed of the man who recites that as e,
matter of tactics he decided not tc raise it but save it?
How would you distinguish that from the one that Justice
White just raised?
MR. WULF:

Because the man, to respond to Justice-

White's question, the defendant himself might know about it
but his lawyer might, without consultation, waive it
without consulting with the defendant.

And if he does not

consult with the' defendant and get his explicit agreement
to the waiver, certainly a very, very important constitutional
right, certainly one of the dimension involved in this case.

12
I think that the question of waiver is still a live question

on. a post-conviction proceeding.
Q

What good is the rule?

MR. WULFs
Q

The rule serves the purpose of—

I mean, under your hypothesis what good is

the rule?
MR. WUI.PS

The rule serves the purpose o

encouraging defense counsel to discuss the issue with their
clients.

That is the purpose it serves.

It encourageu

these claims being raised before trial so that the trial
can proceed in an orderly way.

And if this ease is reversed,

I would think that that would be notice to all attorneys
where there is a possible question of exclusion of Blacks
from a jury, that they had better discuss it first with
their clients.
Q

Do you think the Government attorneys will

read our decision rather than to road the rule?

They have

not read the rule yet.
MR. WULFs

We can only hope they will read the

decisions, Your Honor.
Q

I understand from your position maybe they

did not read the rule.

What makes you think they are going

to read our opinion?
MR. WOLF:

We can only assume that they always

read your opinions, Your Honor.

I do not know how to deal

13
with that problem if lawyers do not read the law.
Q

I understand that your position is that the

defendant knows what the rule is.
rule is.

The lawyer knows what the

And if they fail to communicate together, they

have an automatic 2255.
MR. WULF:

If they do not communicate and if the

lawyer does not secure the explicit waiver of the defendant
on that claim, yes, sir.
Q

Automatic.
%

MR.. WULF:

Automatically,

see any other alternative.

I think so.

1 cannot

Because, according to the

decisions by this Court in Noia and in Kaufman, which apply
to federal defendants, and taking into account also
Humphrey v, Cady last term, which made it explicit that
lawyers have to consult on some issues with their Clients
in order to effect a waiver, there are some issues where
tlie lawyer is going to have to talk to his client once in a
while and get an explicit understanding with him that he is
waiving a substantial constitutional right for whatever the
purpose may be.
Q

In this case* did he allege that' the lawyer

did not talk to him?
MR. WULF:

Ko.

In this case he alleged that the

lawyer made the motion in fact.
Q

But he did not allege that the lawyer did not

14

talk to him.
MR. WULF:
that.

That would be inconsistent to allege

Well, it would not necessarily be inconsistent.

The

record is silent about the extent of their conversation.
In any case, < ur argument in summary rests upon
two cases decided by this Court, Kaufman v. United States
and Noia ,v . Fay, which t< gethei hold that federal
defendants in 2255 actions may raise constitutional issues
in post-conviction proceedings to the exact same extent that
T

state prisoners may do under federal habeas corpus, and
that both,are qualified only by the rule of waiver that has
been enunciated in hoia.
Secondly, we c.is tinguish Shot.we 11 v. United States
as not having application in this case.
And, third, we argue that 12(b)(2) must be
construed in waiver terms to follow the decision by this
Court in Kola, and that that can be clone easily without,
as the Government suggests, holding 12(b)(2) unconstitutional,
because 12(b)(2) in fact uses the term "waiver"

and in

addition allows the district court to allow a motion to file
late with cause.

And our position essentially—it certainly

rejects the Government's suggestion that 12(b)(2) has to be
held unconstitutional.
unconstitutional.

It does not have to be held

It merely has to be construed consonantly

with the decision in Mol.a regarding waiver.

15
Q

Do you view the issue here about challenging

the grand jury differently from the issue in Henry v.
Mississippi insofar as the necessity to consult with the
defendant is concerned?
MR. WOLF:
Q

[No response]

Do you think a lawyer has to consult with a

defendant, about everything before he can wai-'e it, before the
defendant is bound by the lawyer's decision?
MR. WULF:

According to Henry and according to

Humphrey v. Cady, I think that this Court has told lawyers
that they certainly have to consult with their clients about
substantial constitutional issues.
Q

There was a substantial constitutional issue

in Humphrey, was there not?
.MR. WULF:
Q

Yes.

What did the Court say there?

MR. WULF:

It said that the lawyer had to consult,

and since they had not consulted they had not waived.
Q

Did we not send back to see if they knew

about it, knew about the rule?
MR. WULF:
Q

Yes.

What if they did?

MR. WULF:

I -am afraid I have not reviewed Humphrey v

Cady close enough to respond.
Q

At least you say that this grand jury point- is

16
an issue they must consult on,
MR. WULF:

Yes.

Yes,

I see no other way to interpret Noia., if there is
a waiver, that the waiver-Q

Henry was after Noia.

If ^oia said he must

consult about everything, that rule has not survived, has it?
MR. WULF:

As I recall Henry, Henry said that

there had to be an explicit finding of waiver by the
defendant.
Q

Yes, but what constitutes a waiver?

constituted a waiver in Henry?

What

What might constitute a

waiver in Henry?
MR. WULF:
Q

[No response]

Knowledge and failure to object or what?

MR. WULF:

I would think that it would foe

defendant.
Q

Thank you.

MR. WULF:
defense counsel.

Obviously it might be a burden cn

But where fundamental substantial

constitutional rights are concerned, it may be a burden that
has to be imposed in order to vindicate the. constitutional
rights of defendants in criminal cases.
We think that this claim is certainly well within
the scope of the kind of claim that this Court

said in

17
Kaufman has to be entertained-by district courts on Section
2255 cases.

What is at stake is the vindication of

constitutional rights.

And certainly the constitutional

right which is asserted in this case is one that this Court
has required be vindicated for at least a hundred years.
is an elementary right and

thaC ourt

It

never, never swerved

from its consistent position that the exclusion of
minority groups from juries is a violation of the
Constitution in state cases or in federal cases.
And if the defendant in this case is prevented,
because of this procedural default, this asserted procedural
default, from raising this elementary constitutional claim,
then I think that the Court will be retreating from this
hundred year course of decision which has made the jury
exclusion issue a primary constitutional issue.
As far as Shofcweil is concerned—
G

In order to preserve an error for appellate

or even collateral review, you have to raise it in a timely
manner.

That, I would guess, is certainly as old as the

substantive rule that you referred to, is it not, as a
doctrine in this Court.,
MR. WULF:

There is a whole course of decisions

in this Court beginning with Kola and including Kaufman and
by .itself, though that was a. procedural default at trial,
that was a default in appeal, which cut him off from state

But there arc some—and one does not encourage

remedies.

procedural defaults, obviously.

But one does say that where

important constitutional rights of defendants '••;.* e concerned-”
and this Court has said it in Noia and said it in Kaufman--"
that there has to be a forum made available for his federal
rights to be vindicated if he did not have an opportunity
to have them heard and assessed in. the trial court.
Q

Certainly there was an opportunity, at least

theoretical.
MR. WULF:
Q

Yes.

MR. WOLF:
Q

There always is.

There is always an opportunity for—

But I mean a specific opportunity given by

the rule.
MR. WULF:

There is specific opportunity for counsel

to raise constitutional objections all along the course of
trial,
Q

And if he does not do it, it is just common

ground—it is just run-of-the-mill jurisprudence of this
Court that if he does not raise it in a timely manner, he
has lost. it.

That' certainly was not the case in

Kaufman, it certainly was not.the case in Hoia»

X mean,

they were raised at trial, but they were not pursued on
appeal.

And it seems to me that Npla's discussion revolved

entirely around the question of procedural default and in
that case it happened to be' default because of failure to
appeal.

But default at trial seems to b© no different to me.
A defendant ought not to be held to have forfeited

Ho, they were not in those two cases, but—

If you are going to say that, you must say

then that there are some reasons that will e:ccuse not
raising it and other reasons that will, will not.
What are the reasons, for example, that will
excuse not raising it if you know about it?

with having a hearing in every case just to find out what

Q

Is that a pleading of a fact, in your view?

MR. WULF:

By a pro se petitioner it might well

be considered as an adequate pleading.

I would think so.

I do not know how much legal knowledge Davis
actually had.

He had some knowledge, evidently, about the

waiver issue.

He was not totally uninformed about it.

But

I do not know whether he knew what would constitute a waiver

That is a very important

And when that is alleged and where the additional

facts are alleged, even in conclusory terms, that the
defendant did not waiver, I think—and perhaps in addition
given the* fact that this case arose in Mississippi and given
the history of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision
regarding state prisoners and their recognition of the special
problem in the state of Mississippi regarding the exclusion
of Blacks from juries—that this case demanded a hearing
on the facts.
Q

But this was tried in a federal court,

MR. WULF:

This was tried in a federal court, yes,

25

sir.

And there is, of course, the distinctive treatment

that the Fifth Circuit applies to state cases and to federal
cases in the State of Mississippi.

They have reversed a

large number of state cases on exclusion grounds and federal
habeas.

And, on the other hand, in this case and in others,

they have refused to allow such claims to be raised if they
were not properly raised, timely raised, under 12(b)(2)* the
implication being that they are not making the same kind of
assumptions about the practice in federal court as they
very readily have made about the practice in state courts.
But that is only an assumption.

And again a factual hearing

would be necessary in order to find out exactly what the
practices are in the

Northern District of Mississippi.

And I might say that the affidavits which the
Government filed in soma other case here, including the
affidavits of 67 attorneys practicing in the Northern
District of Mississippi mean nothing.

Those 67 affidavits,

with four exceptions, are written in precisely the same
terms and exactly the same language. I think they were
prepared by the U. S. Attorney’s Office and circulated to
his friends in the Northern District.

And there are no

allegations there except by lawyers, conclusory allegations
that significant numbers of Blacks have appeared on juries.
But that is certainly not any kind of a determination that
ought to persuade any of us that jury selection procedures

in the Northern District are adequate *

ORAL ARGUMENT OP EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KORMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas a

the Court:
The issue presented in this case is not, m the
petitioner alleges in his reply brief, whether the right to
grand jury indictment—whether this Court should assign the
prohibition against racial discrimination in grand jury
selection to the dust bin.
The issue, rather, is whether that right should be
vindicated in the orderly procedure promulgated by this
Court in Rule 12(b)(2) and adopted by Congress, and that
procedure is simply that the motion which dees not go to the
fairness of the trial, which does not go to the
admissibility of any evidence at the trial, which does not
go to the defendant's guilt or innocence but to a defect in
the pre-trial proceedings which can easily be cured if
timely raised, whether such a motion should be raised prior
to trial or years later after trial and conviction when
retrial may be difficult or impossible in a federal habeas
corpus proceeding.

27

I would like to talk about Rule 12(b)(2) for a
while rather than the habeas corpus statute, because Rule
12(b)(2) is not simply a procedure for making a motion prior
to trial.

Rule 12(b)(2) under the enabling act is the

equivalent of a specific federal statute.
Under the terms of the enabling act, Rule 12(b)(2)
operates in fact to repeal any statute which is inconsistent
with its provisions.

And Rule 12(b)(2) does not talk about

knowing, deliberate waivers.

It does not talk about waivers

that are made only with consultations by the defendant’s
lawyer with his client.
Rule 12(b)(2) says in plain terms that if you do
.not make this motion it shall be deemed waived.

This is

really not a waiver in the general sense of the term but
really the equivalent of a statute of limitations * just as
one's right to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment
is not waived unless you have a knowing and deliberate
waiver, that does not operate to make a statute of limitations
which says you can only raise this claim for just
compensation in three years or four years unconstitutional.
Rule 12(b)(2) has the same affect as an ordinary
statute of limitations for the assertion of a particular
constitutional right.

And the policy considerations which

motivated the adoption of Rule 12 (3d) are rather plain.
There really is no incentive for a lawyer representing a

28
defendant to make this kind of a motion before trial,
because what does he get?

What would Mr. Davis's lawyer

have gotten for him had he made this motion prior to the
trial and had he been successful?
He would have gotten for Mr. Davis a new indictment.
And Mr. Davis would have stood trial and, hy the way

it -if;

worth noting hare that the defendant was caught in the. act.
There is not the slightest question that any grand juror,
black or white, faithful to his oath, would have voted this
indictment.
So, he would have gotten simply a new indictment,
and that is true with many defects in the institution of the
proceedings.

They are easily cured if you make the motions

when you are supposed to make them.
On the other hand, there is a great incentive to
sit back and say, "Why should X bother making this motion
now?

Let me take my chances on. an acquittal.

Arid if he is

found guilty, well, then, I can go ahead and make the motion
after trial."

And that is just another*way of upsetting a

valid judgment of conviction.
The statute, despite the fact that Rule 12(b)(2)
thus has a reasonable justification, it is not an absolute
waiver provision.

It has an express clause that gives

the judge the right to grant relief from the provisions of
the waiver, from the. waiver clause, upon a showing of just

29
cause.

No shewing of just cause was made hero *

courts below so found.

And both

There was not the slightest doubt

that this defect about which the petitioner complains could
have been made and discovered with due diligence at the time*
And so that we have here a rule which is the
equivalent of a federal statute and which takes precedence
over anything to the contrary in a federal habeas corpus
statute.

And having said that, let me say one more thing.

That at the time Rule 12(b)(2) was adopted, there was no
conflict between Rule 12(b)(2) and the federal habeas
corpus statute in 1945; it was well understood and settled
law that if you did not comply with the procedural rule
raise an objection timely when you should have, you could act
get federal habeas corpus relief.

And, as a matter of fact,

this Court so held in Daniels v. Allen decided in 1952,
after the adoption of the federal rules.
To the extent that there is now any inconsistency
between the federal habeas corpus statute and the provisions
of Rule 12(b)(2), it has resulted because of a thorough
reexamination of the language of the federal habeas corpus
statute undertaken in Fay v, Hoia.
There is no similar basis for reinterpretation of
Rule 12(b) that the defendant asks for here.

Rule 12(b) —

both the language of Rule 12(b), the advisory committee
notes, the notes of the preliminary draftsman, all indicate

30
(a) that it was intended to apply here and (b) that it was
intended fco apply regardless of whether or not there was i
knowing and deliberate waiver.
There are state cases which are cited, and
Mr. Wulf has alluded to them, in which the Fifth Circuit
has granted habeas corpus relief to state prisoners.

There

are a few things that I would like to say about those cases.
First, any state procedural rule which is the
equivalent of Rule 12(b)

and which is inconsistent with the

habeas corpus statute would, under the Supremacy Clause,
have to yield to those provisions.

As the Court noted in

Fay v. Noia, state procedural rules must yield to the strong
policy considerations which are reflected by the federal
habeas corpus statute.
In this case, as far as this federal prisoner is
concerned, the federal policy is stated by Rule 12(b)(2)
that was promulgated by this Court, that was adopted by
Congress, and it need not yield to the contrary under 18
U.S.C. 3771.

It is the habeas corpus statute which must

yield.
In the second place, it was not until last year
in the case which will be heat'd right after this one, that
any federal court held that where the sole claim was to the
grand jury, not the grand jury and the petit jury, that this
claim could be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding.

31

As a matter of fact, in Parker.-v. north Carolinareported at 337 U.S., decided long after Fay and after
Kaufman, Mr. Justice White stated for the Court that the
issue whether the failure to comply with a procedural rule
similar to Rule 12(b) would stand as a bar to federal habeas
corpus relief was still an. open question.
There are many reasons why that should stand as
an open question—
Q

What, would you say if there was an allegation

in this case that the reason for not raising the matter to
back up his claim of no waiver—let

us assume that he was

threatened that if he raised it, he would be charged with
something else„
MR. KORMANs

I think under Rule 12(b) the judge

has wide discretion to grant relief from the waiver
provisions.

And if he came up with a reason that moved the

court to exercise its discretion—
Q

What would be a good reason, in your book?

MR. KORMAN:
suggested.

I think the reason that Your Honor

I think another reason might be the inability

to—
Q

What about a reason that it would annoy the

judge?
MR, KORMANs
adequate reason

X would not think that that was an

32
Q

You would not?

MR. KORMAN:
Q
•

No.

So, what about the state cases?

MR. KORMAN:

As I have indicated, all of the state

cases until the most recent one in Winters v. Cook all
involved claims with respect to both the grand and petit
jury, and 1 am willing to concede for these purposes that
the claim of discrimination in the selection of a jury, the
petit jury as opposed to the grand jury, involves different
considerations that are based on the difference of the role
of the grand jury—
Q

If the objection is made outside the presence

of a jury?
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Pardon me?

If the objection is made outside the presence

of a jury?
MR. KORMAN:

No.

What I am saying is that the

right is simply more significant.

And, therefore, before

waiver is implied, perhaps there might be a greater showing
or less of a requirement than ought to be made in terms of
explaining waiver than in the cases of grand juries,
not conceding it.

I am

I merely suggest the two cases are not

necessarily the same.
There are lots of times—
Q

There should have been a hearing in this case

33
if he had made an allegation of a sufficient reason?
MR. KORMAH;

If it were sufficient on its face and

it was not contradicted, I would assume—
Q

If it was contradicted you would have the

hearing?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes.

The same strong policy considerations which, we
submit, motivated and justify Rule 12(b) would also and
should also justify that a district court in denying habeas
corpus relief, even if there were no Rule 12(b)—-all of the
cases that this Court has dealt with involved claims with
respect to the fairness of the trial, to the admissibility
of the evidence, and to claims which go ultimately fco whether
the person should be found guilty or not guilty.
The claim with respect to a grand jury stands on
a much, much different level.
those claims at all.

It does not involve any of

It involves simply the issue of

whether this man should be indicted on the basis ox a
particular set of facts.

While the right to a grand jury, of

course, is a significant and important right, this Court has
recognised the distinction on several occasions, that is, the
distinction between the petit jury and the grand jury.
In the first place, it has refused fco hold that the
right to a grand jury is so fundamental that the states must
provide it under the Due Process Clause.

34
In Costello v, Onited States the issue was whether
a defendant could obtain a review of the grand jury minutes
to determine whether, there was any evidence, any legally
sufficient evidence at all, to sustain the indictment., and
this Court in a unanimous opinion said no, and Mr, Justice
Black, writing for the Court, said that in a trial on the
merits, defendants are entitled to a strict observance of
all the rules designed to bring about a fair verdict.
"Defendants are not entitled, however, to a rule
which would result in interminable delay but add nothing to
Idle assurance of a fair trial."
The right to a grand jury does not have anything
to do with the right to a fair trial.

And to permit it to

be asserted years after a judgment of conviction whan
retrial may be difficult or impossible, would have an
undesirable effect on the entire criminal justice system
as it has come to be recognized.

The notion that there

must come a time when judgments of conviction bocome final,
when they are no longer subject—when issues which have
nothing to do with guilt ox innocence or with the fairness
of the trial cannot be rehashed over and over again in a
criminal proceeding.

And we submit that in this case the

Court properly ruled that the claim was barred by Rule 12 (b)(2)

and a properly denied habeas corpus relief.
