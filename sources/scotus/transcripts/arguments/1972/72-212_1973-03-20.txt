MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-212, Cupp against Murphy.
Mr. Denney, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS II. DENNEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» DENNEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This is a federal habeas corpus case, here on writ
of certiorari to review a judgment of the United STates Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The petitioner is the

Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary, and he has
the respondent, Daniel P. Murphy, in his custody.
An Oregon State trial court convicted Murphy of
second-degree murder, the second-degree murder of his wife;
his conviction was affirmed by the Oregon Court of Appeals.
The Oregon Supreme Court denied a petition for discretionary
review of that decision. This Court denies Murphy's petition
for certiorari.
Murphy then commenced this present Federal habeas
corpus action.

The United States District Court for the

District of Oregon, relying very much on the opinion of the
Oregon Court of Appeals, and agreeing with it in full, denied
habeas corpus relief; and on Murphy's appeal to the Ninth
Circuit, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, ordering

4
Petitioner Cupp to release Murphy within sixty days unless
the State of Oregon retries him within that timeThere’s been only one question raised and preserved
throughout these proceedings, and that is the legality of the
seizure of certain evidence which was used in Murphy's trialIn the State court trial, as part of the showing that Murphy
strangled his wife while she was asleep in bed and while
wearing a rayon acetate nightgown, the State introduced some
scrapings that were taken from underneath Murphy's fingernails while he was at the police station, and those scrapings
revealed the presence of blood, skin cells, cotton fibers,
and rayon acetate fibersThe case -— well, the Oregon Court of Appeals and
the U, S- District Court, and our position here can be
reduced into three simple propositions, basically, the first
being that as the courts of Oregon held, the police had
probable cause to either arrest or to search Murphy

at the

time they conducted the search, that there were exigent
circumstances justifying an immediate taking of the evidence
from Murphy, even though the police did not formally place
Murphy under arrest, nor did they seek to obtain a search
warrant to seize this evidence from underneath Murphy’s
fingernails, and finally that the momentary detention while
this evidence was taken was more reasonable, or at least no
less reasonable than the full-scale formal arrest would have

5
been, or than detaining Murphy indefinitely, restraining him
physically to the degree that would have been necessary to
prevent possible loss or destruction of this evidence for the
longer time that would have been necessary to obtain a search
warrant after Murphy arrived at the police station.
On the issue of whether or not there was probable
cause to conduct the search, every court below has held that
there was probable cause for the police to act, but of course
the question is briefed and argued here.

I think that in

their brief counsel for Murphy and counsel for the American
Civil Liberties Union, who are appearing here amicus curiae
on Murphy's behalf, understate the evidence.
The facts of the case in this particular situation
were that the police had the — were investigating a strangu­
lation murder.

The deceased was found in her bed in a

perfectly made-up room, there were no signs of disturbance,
no signs of forced entry of the house, no signs of robbery.
All of this, we think, tends to show that the killer was
probably known to the deceased.
The Murphys had been separated for some time, and
Murphy was not living in the Murphy house at the time of the
homicide; but he had been, the police learned, expected home
that night.
The deceased was manually strangled, to the
observation of the homicide detectives.

There was not a formal

6

medical report on this point for some time, but the officers
made their own opinion, which I think is enough to constitute
probable cause, even though we of course don't have at this
point legally admissible opinion as to the cause of death.
There were scratches on the neck of the deceased,
which appeared to the officers to be scratches made from
fingernails of the strangler.

This was later confirmed, at

least to be a fingernail scraping by the pathologist who
examined the body.
And the son, the 18-year-old son of the Murphys,
who was the only other person in the house, or known to be
in the house on the night of the murder, was apparently a
chronic nail-biter»

Now, the record is not perhaps as clear

on this point as it might be desired, but it does — but the
police do say that he bit his fingernails well back into the
quick, he had no fingernails; it was absolutely impossible
to scrape them.

I believe that's all the record specifically

says.
I conjecture from this, perhaps unjustifiably, I
don't know, that he is a chronic nail-biter who has bit his
nails for a long time.

There's a suggestion, in trying to

negate the existence of probable cause, in respondent's
brief that there's no evidence in the record as to when this
nail-biting occurred.

My inference from my reading of the

record simply is that this was a chronically recurring

7
condition»
At any rate, they also learned — the police also
learned from the son, Patrick Murphy, that Murphy was expected
home that evening.

The police called Camp Sherman, Oregon,

which is in eastern Oregon, incidentally, rather than in
southern Oregon as the record several times says; it's in
central Oregon, about a hundred miles east of Salem, and left
word of Mrs. Murphy's death.

Murphy was not at Camp Sherman

at the time. They learned from the person that they talked to
over the telephone that he had ostensibly been going into
Portland the preceding night, and he was expected back.
The police left word for Murphy to call.

And he

did, about 4 p.m.
Without, apparently — according to the record •—
without inquiring into the circumstances of his wife's death,
other than to confirm the fact that his wife was indeed dead,
Murphy immediately went into a long account of where he had
been the night before, without any questioning on the
officer's part.
lie then agreed to come to Portland to discuss the
case further with the police.
When he arrived at the station, he was fully advised
of his constitutional rights, and he had two lawyers called,
who came to the station to represent him.

Murphy again seemed

curiously disinterested in the circumstances of his wife's

death, and his behavior struck the detectives as unusual in
that respect.
While they were talking to him, one of the detectives
saw a dark spot underneath Murphy's right thumbnail, which
prompted him to think about taking fingernail scrapings.
They asked Murphy for permission to scrape his
fingernails, and, on the advice of counsel, he refused.
Whereupon the police scraped the fingernails anyway.
There is also testimony in the record that when the
request for fingernail scrapings was made, Murphy suddenly
and immediately put his hands behind his back and started
moving his hands, and that he then inserted them into his
pockets, moving them around very vigorously so that change
or something metallic in the pockets was heard rattling.
We think that all of this, all of these circum­
stances clearly gave the police probable cause to act to
secure the fingernail scrapings.
j

QUESTION? But he was detained against his will for
the limited time necessary to take the scrapings which were
also taken against his will, is that right?
MR. DENNEY:

That is correct.

QUESTION: So why wasn't that, from a constitutional
point of view, an arrest?
MR. DENNEY:

I thought —

QUESTION: Even though it might not have been from the

9

point of view of Oregon law; why wasn't it from the
constitutional point of view an arrest, just as in Davis v.
Mississippi?

We said, although Mississippi says this was

not an arrest, this was only a dragnet taking people in to
the jailhouse to take their fingerprints, we said from the
constitutional point of view, yes, it was a seizure-

So

why wasn't this?
MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

I —
In Mississippi we said it was an

unreasonable seizure -MR. DENNEY:
QUESTION:

I realize that, but —
— and an unreasonable search. But why

would not this have been a seizure under the Fourth and
Fourteenth Amendments, that was a reasonable one?

MR» DENNEY;

Right,

I suppose the only answer I

can give there, Mr, Justice Stewart, because it does occur
to me that this could be perfectly well denominated an
arrest, and that would be ~~
QUESTION;

A seizure within the Fourth and Fourteenth

Amendments
MR. DENNEY;
QUESTION;

And a seizure incident to the arrest,
and a seizure upon probable cause,

and a search incident to that reasonable seizure within the
bounds of Chimel v, California,
MR, DENNEY:

Yes, sir»

QUESTION: Why isn't that your case?
MR. DENNEY:

The reason, I think, is because the

Oregon Court of Appeals held, rightly or wrongly, and we have
followed this all the way along, and I believe that they
cited one of the decisions of this Court in so saying, that
the arrest is the taking of the person into custody to make
him answer for the charge.
QUESTION:

Well, that may well be true, as a matter

of Oregon law, just as in Louisiana they said, as a matter of
Louisiana law, taking that young man Davis down to the
station house was not an arrest.

I'm sorry, the Mississippi

lav;,
MR. DENNEY:

I see.

Well —

11

QUESTION; But we said — we said in Davis v,
Mississippi that as a matter of the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments it was a seizure.
MR. DENNEYs Well, I am simply adhering to what the
Oregon court said —
QUESTION?
MR. DENNEY:

Not very understandably —
— at page 79 of the printed Appendix,

they cite Terry vs. Ohio for the definition that they used,
and went from there to say, well, even if it isn't an arrest,
or assuming that it isn't an arrest -QUESTION:

But you're not confined to the Oregon

State Supreme Court's basis to defend this judgment here, are
you?
MR. DENNEYs

Oh, I appreciate that, Mr. Chief Justice.

But I did not have the confidence in the position that the
Oregon Court of Appeals did not adopt that I have here.
It's that simple.
Of course, if —
QUESTION?
MR. DENNEYs
QUESTION:

Well, all I meant —
I'm rather grateful to Your Honor.
It may have sounded like a statement, but

what I was asking you was a question, otherwise.
MR. DENNEYs

Yes.

If this Court of course holds that is an arrest
within the meaning of the search and seizure incident to a

12

lawful arrest problem, that's the end of the case, of course?
and —
QUESTION;
MR» DENNEY;
QUESTION;

If there was probable cause»
Yes»
Well, the Ninth — you haven't gotten to

what the Court of Appeals did, have you?
MR. DENNEY;
QUESTION;

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
You still have some — some — What did

the Court of Appeals do?
MR. DENNEY;

The Court of Appeals held that there

were no exigent circumstances -QUESTION;

Yes, but they set it aside, even

assuming there was probable cause»
MR. DENNEY;
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

Yes, Your Honor.
So we can proceed on the basis that

there was probable cause, in which event you say it doesn't
make any difference whether it was an arrest or not.
MR. DENNEY:

That is true. That is essentially the
t

position that the Oregon Court of Appeals took, and perhaps
they misunderstood the decisions of this Court as to whether
this was an arrest or not.
QUESTION: Well, let's go on.
MR. DENNEY:

As for the exigent circumstances

which justified the immediate seizure from Murphy's person,
whether or not he was under arrest, we think it's quite clear

13

that this evidence at least was potentially, readily
destructible and perhaps, if the testimony of the Deputy
District Attorney, who was present at the time the request
was made,and one of the detectives, if that testimony is to be
believed, it was in fact in the actual process of destruction
at the time the police took the fingernail scrapings.
QUESTIONS So you don't contend that just because
there was probable cause, or that just because there was a
seizure protected by the Fourth Amendment, you don't say that
automatically the police had the right to take the fingernail
scrapings, do you?
MR, DENNEYs

No, in the abssence of the exigent

circumstances, which are present here — I'm not arguing for
a blanket rule that probable cause justifies seizure, warrants
a seizure of a person.
QUESTION;

Well, you're saying that Schmerber type

considerations apply, are applied?
MR. DENNEY:

Very much so, and if anything the

situation here is even more critical because the alcohol in
Schmerber's bloodstream was so — would only dissipate itself
over a relatively lengthy period of time/ whereas Murphy
could have destroyed the fingernail scrapings, if given the
opportunity, in a matter of seconds.
Again, assuming that this was not an arrest within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and that the search in

14
this case has to be justified without the arrest factor
involved in it, it is our position, as developed in the brief,
that this is in fact a less serious invasion of Murphy's
privacy than would have been the case, either had the police
made a full-scale arrest and kept him indefinitely while the
fingernail scrapings were analysed, instead of releasing
him after the scrapings were taken, or holding him at the
station and forcibly restraining him from making any attempt
to destroy the evidence which was literally at his finger­
tips *
As the Oregon Court of Appeals observed, we just
don't think proper application of the Fourth Amendment requires
any such extreme measure„
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lonergan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD R. LONERGAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LONERGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justices:

I think the first consideration is rather like this
ic/

case held in Coolidge, it's implicit in Coolidge.

That

essentially every extension into the protections of the
Bill of Rights is really not an end in itself, but is merely
the springboard for the next extension.
For example, —
QUESTION: Sometimes the reverse of that proposition
is true, too, isn't it?

15

MR. LONERGAN:
QUESTION?

I don't know of any.

Well, go on, then.

MR. LOMERGAN:

You take, now, for example, Mr.

Justice Stewart has mentioned, was this not an arrest?
Well, of course, that would be contrary to this case, this
Court's decision in Terry, because it held there that the
detention was not an arrest because it was not the first step
in a criminal proceeding.
Now, of course, the word "arrest", if we give it
its English or French meaning literally, it is any stopping.
And yet Terry was to the contrary.
So I don't

think we can say it was an arrest.

Furthermore, we have the situation of when you say
it v/as on probable cause, it is about the thinnest case of
probable cause that I can see from the actual facts, because
I think Mr. Denney beefed up the facts to a certain extent.
QUESTION;

Well, don't we — aren't we reviewing a

judgment of the Court of Appeals that rested on an assumption
there was probable cause?
MR. LONERGAN;

I don't think it did rest on that

assumption, but even if there were —
QUESTION; All right, then you have to consider, then,
that the State is justified in having us look at the case on
the assumption there vas probable cause.
MR. LONERGAN;

I would think that you have to
i

16

determine whether there* s probable cause, if you reach —
if you reach that
QUESTIONS

We normally don’t»

We normally don’t

reach those questions in the first instance. We normally ask
the lower courts to decide those questions first.
MR. LQNERGAN:

That I recognize.

But, be that as it may, if I might say it, that
ordinarily, for example — if there was — the question is
whether there was probable cause to arrest? that answer is
generally they did not arrest, in the traditional sense of
the word. Ordinarily, for example, if an officer makes an
arrest, as I understand the underlying English decisions,
he has to justify on the position he's taken.
Here they did not justify themselves, in their own
minds at least, that they were arresting him for the crime of
murder.

Instead, on the instructions of the District Attorney,

they were scraping his fingernails for evidence.

And I think

the probable cause there comes down to this point;
Ordinarily, on a search for evidence or to get
probable cause for a warrant, let's say, you must have
probable cause that the material is there.

Here, as the

officer testified, that he had no idea what would turn up
until they got a lab examination.

And that he would have done

this to any suspect, no matter — no matter, the dark spot or
anything.

f

17
So I don't think, really, it presents the correct
probable cause question.

to make this springboard, is whether the material was present®
QUESTIONS You don’t attach much weight to the
evidence, the testimony that there was an effort to dispose,
an apparent effort to dispose of the evidence, do you?

Rather than call the —

Well, Davis, I don't consider that an

And therefore this Court held that that was

illegal, and the evidence should be suppressed.
I think that applies here.

He is a suspect, he is

and therefore it violated the Fourth Amendment.
But it’s not, to my mind, an arrest, because they

18
certainly didn't consider it an arrest.

purposes you can have a seizure under the Fourth Amendment

Yes, Terry was just that sort of a

Terry was not an arrest.

Terry was not

He was, however, detained, and this Court said the

Fourth Amendment applied.
QUESTION;

But Terry was arrested after they found

the gun.
MR„ LONERGANs
QUESTION*

Later.

But not at the stopping —

It was about a minute later.

And you say there was no grounds for probable cause
to arrest here at all?
MR, LONERGANs

I don't see it.

They had a stormy

marriage, that's hardly grounds for — he was somewhere
present, by his own statement; he was somewhere present*
But this other business, like this cut with the
fingernails, that isn't what the evidence is, it was something

19

sharp.

That the fingernails of the son were bitten, but when

were they bitten?
That the bed was made up; when was it made up?
After she was killed?
The doors were locked; when were they locked?

After

she was killed?
In other words, the evidence, to me, is highly —
highly flimsy.

It's -- it certainly doesn't warrant a man

of reasonable probability to reach that conclusion; and the
answer is the police did not do it.

They did not reach the

conclusion that they had probable cause to arrest this man,
they didn't arrest him.

He wasn't arrested until a month

later, after an indictment was obtained.
They discussed it with the District Attorney.

It was an

Now the State has later on made

an attempt to make it a probable cause case.

But as

evidence is subject to destruction.

Because all

If all the policeman has to say is that ”1 feared it

you've discarded the affidavit of probable cause.

He

If he were trying to

spoil evidence, they could have restrained him from doing it*
This Court allowed the detention for the purpose of

Van Leeuwen.

The same thing applies here, I'd say.

QUESTION!

Now you've just said that if he was

trying to destroy evidence, the police could restrain him.
Didn't they?
MR. LONERGAN:

Restrain him from destroying the

evidence?
QUESTION.*

Yes.

MR. LONERGAN:

Apparently not.

QUESTION: Well, I thought immediately —
MR0 LONERGAN:
QUESTION:

They just scraped them.

— I thought immediately when this

activity was noticed, they then proceeded to take the
fingernail scrapings.
MR, LONERGAN: They called the Deputy District

21

Attorney and asked him what to do.
QUESTION:

Well, but they held him right there

all the time,
MR, LONERGANs Well, he was there,
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LONERGAN: So apparently he didn't make any
serious attempt to destroy the evidence, otherwise he probably
would have done it.
QUESTION: Well, he didn't make a successful attempt,
that's all we know now, isn't it?
MR. LONERGAN: Well, we know he didn't make a
successful attempt; but it probably couldn't have been serious,
or he would have succeeded.
QUESTION:

Well, hasn't the court said often that

in evaluating these things they must be evaluated as a
trained, experienced police officer sees them through his
eyes, in light of all the surrounding circumstances?
MR. LONERGAN:

I don’t —

QUESTION: So that putting his hands in his pockets
and putting his hands behind him after the subject of
fingernail scrapings comes up might mean nothing to a tourist
who was going by, but might mean a great deal to an
experienced police officer,
MR, LONERGAN: Well, they said that what motivated
them, they said that he was a suspect and they would have done

22

it to any suspect-

And they had, as I say, they had time

enough to call a Deputy District Attorney and get his opinion
on the subject and follow that, they had time enough to call
a magistrate and get his authorization; and that would have
complied.
I see it really no different from Davis; that
instead of getting a warrant in Davis, they rounded him up
and got it.
If you're going to say exigent circumstances, you've
discarded the Fourth Amendment-

All evidence can be

destroyed.
As to the probable cause, what can I say — if we
are going to jump, the automobile poised for flight, now to
allow searches of persons, and I assume houses, on probable
cause — even that is not available,because they had no idea
what they would find, as they testified, until the lab
examination.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you.
Mr- Denney, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS II. DENNEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DENNEY:

Just briefly, two points, Your Honor,

I think that the fact that the police did not in
fact arrest Murphy at that time, or did not formally place
him under arrest and hold him indefinitely, no more negates

23

the existence of probable cause than the fact that a person
is arrested establishes that there is.

This is a matter for

the courts to review, in the light of what the facts and
circumstances known to the police officer area? and our
position is that there was ample cause here, and I think we’ve
been supported in that determination by every court below.
The second thing is, X do not see this case as
controlled by Davis in the respect advocated by counsel hers,
because, as I’ve developed in our petitioner's brief, the
Davis, there was no probable cause? this was a summary roundup
of every Negro in the community when all the assailant in a
rape case knew was that her assailant was a Negro, and a
fingerprinting of them all.
Our contention here is that the finger of probable
cause had pretty well focused on Murphy at the time the
police acted.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:24 o'clock, a.m., the case was
submitted.]
