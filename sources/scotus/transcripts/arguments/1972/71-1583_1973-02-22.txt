MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

in No. 71-1583.
Mr. Ullerich, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY G. ULLERICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ULLERICH: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court:
The constitutionality of the California Candidate
Filing Fee System is the subject of this direct appeal on
the judgment of a three-judge Federal District Court granting
a preliminary injunction against the California Secretary
of State and the various county clerks In the State of
California.

The injunction, in effect, mandated the

California Secretary of State to accept declarations of
candidacy in the last primary election without payment of
the statutory candidate filing fee of one percent of the
annual salary of the office sought, as least as to those
members of the class of the plaintiff below who were willing
to file and affidavit with the county clerk that they had
Insufficient money or property to personally pay the candidate
filing fee.
The issues presented by this appeal from the judgment
granting a preliminary injunction is, does California’s
Election Code Section 6552, itfhich imposes the statutory filing

4
fee violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States
Constitution?
Subsidiary issues are what is the appropriate
standard of review when this statute is challenged in a
judicial proceeding?

The additional issue is whether this

case is controlled by the decision last term in Bullock versus
Carter 405 U.S. 134.
And a final issue is, if a less stringent standard
of review is applicable herein other than the standard
imposed in the Bullock case, does the California Candidate
Filing Fee have a rational basis which would be sustained
under the traditional rational basis test under the Equal
Protection Clause?
Factually, California requires a party primary
election in even numbered years preceding the general
election.

For the name of a candidate to appear on the

primary ballot in June of even-numbered years, the candidate
must obtain declaration of candidacy forms from the county
clerk and at that time he is required to pay a candidate
filing fee.
There is no method for a candidate's name to
appear on the primary ballot without paying the candidate
filing fee.

Basically for state or federal office, that fee

is either one or two percent of the annual salary of the
office.

5
Q

In that respect, why is it a percentage?

isn’t it a flat fee?

Why

Doesn’t it cost the state as much to

process something for the dogcatcher as it does for the
United States Senate?
MR. ULLERICH:

The answer to that, I believe, your

Honor, is that the — a particular flat fee over the years
with the inflation that we have would tend to be perhaps
minimal at one period of time and can become rather excessive
in other periods of inflation or depression periods.
I think the annual salary, I mean the basis of the
annual salary is pegged in more to the actual benefits at the
end of the rainbow, if you will, and a3 the salary changes,
the fee also changes somewhat.

I think also there is a

consideration that rather than being pegged at a very
minimal fee of, say, as was suggested in one case of $10 or
$15 to handle the actual cost of handling the papers would not
achieve the state objective that these candidate filing fees
are designed to achieve.

That is, to avoid overcrowding

of the ballots, fragmentation of votes or discouraging
frivolous candidates.
The fee must be something more than a merely
nominal fee to accomplish that purpose.
Q

But you are charging candidate A more than

candidate B if they are not running for the same office.
MR. ULLERICH:

That is true, your Honor.

As you’ll

6
see from our statute, sir, quoted in our brief, the fees would
vary from no fee at all if there is really no compensation
for the office to one or two percent and the distinction for
the one or two percent that seems to be apparent in the
statute is that if it is a statewide office, for Instance the
United States Senate or a governor or lieutenant governor
and so forth, there would be some activity on the part of 58
county clerks or county registrars of voters in regard to
that particular candidate whereas if you are running from a
particular district such as a member of Congress or state
assembly or state Senator, there is usually only one particular
county or a limited district that would be involved in
processing those papers.
Q

Well, then, also, if I understand your argument,

you first quote the language in Bullock, recognizing that the
state has a legitimate interest in regulating the number of
candidates on the ballot and preventing clogging of its
election machinery by frivolous candidates and your argument
is that a $10 or $15 fee tfouldn’t keep a candidate for
senator or governor, a vrholly frivolous, nonserious one off
the ballot.

You’d need a higher figure to accomplish the

state’s purpose whereas a $10 or $15 fee probably would keep
off a frivolous candidate for dogcatcher.
MR. ULLERICH:

Is that right?

That would be true, your Honor, and

I think we have, where we are not

writing on a clean slate

7
any more following that language In Bullock, as we pointed
out in our brief, down in New Mexico, the Federal District
Court invalidated the six percent of the annual salary filing
fee for candidates for the United States Senate.
Following that Federal District Court ruling there
were 40 candidates who filed for the United States Senate
and appeared on that ballot, only four of which paid the
candidate filing fee.
We haven’t had a real experience in California
because the decision below was rendered on March 9th, 1972.
March 10th was the cut-off date for candidates to get their
declarations of candidacy and their sponsor certificates into
the county clerk.

So ttfith the limited publicity and the

limited time, we haven't had the full experience.

But if we

can extrapolate a little bit from New Mexico to, say, the
City of Los Angeles, if one candidate for every 50,000 people
were to appear on the ballot, we would have like 50 candidates
running for mayor of the City of Los Angeles and, certainly,
there has to be something, some gauge to make sure that
candidates have a modicum of support and a sufficient backing
to really be termed a serious candidate.
Q

Why?

MR. ULLERICH:
Q

Why?

— and one —

Why can’t an individual citizen of this

state that has no more support than himself have a right to

8
run?
For any office?
MR. ULLSRICH:

Well, I — I think the reasons we

have to give for that, really, the history of the candidate
filing fee, your Honor, is that, part of it, these candidate
filing fees came in to avoid this overcrowding.

Really, the

theory was to give people a more rational choice by limiting
their choice somewhat.

If you have too many candidates, you

really couldn't understand all of the issues and the
candidate and you couldn't really make a rational decision.
And, secondly, we have certain limitations, like
In California —
Q

Well, then you could have a selective one

and only have two.

Then you could understand them real well.

MR. ULLERICH:

Well, what I am saying also Is in

58 counties in California —
Q

Then why do you have it on the — is this gross

or after Income tax?
MR. ULLERICH:
Q

Well, this is on the gross.

The gross, yes.

MR. ULLERICH:

For instance, for a member of Congress

with 42,500, he would be $425 and —
Q

Do you think that no man who doesn't have $400

has the right to run?
MR. ULLERICH:

Well, I'm saying, really, that the

9
personal wealth or lack of wealth of the individual candidate
is really not the critical issue* that we all know that
campaigns cost a lot of money.

That may or may not be a good

thing, but campaigns cost a lot of money.

I think in the last

election, the newspapers were talking about $400 million for
contributions to candidates and what I am saying is that a
candidate, say, spends $50,000 or $100,000 to run to be a
member in Congress and if you have sufficient support in your
community or your interest group to be a serious candidate
for that position, there is nothing in the lav; to say that
the $425 can’t come from contributions of your supporters,
is that really that that is a fee that is just substantial
enough to really make 3ure that you are going to make a
serious run for this office.
Q

And then you say to the poor man, I guess,

the usual language in this day and age and he has no chance
of running.
MR. ULLERICH:

No, I’m saying that a poor man has a

good chance of running.

If he goes out — we have — we have

something different —
Q

If a poor man without a rich friend runs.

MR. ULLERICH:

A poor man without a rich friend?

He would have —
Q

A dead digit.

MR. ULLERICH:

— he would have to run — in the

10

spring of 1974, for instance, he knows what our statutory fee
is and has been for a good many years.

He knows a long way

in advance as to how much money he is going to have to gather
from contributions from friends, relatives and supporters to
really conduct a serious campaign and one facet of that that
he is going to have to consider is he is at least going to
have to raise the filing fee before his name is going

to

appear on the ballot.
Q

Is it your brief or one of the Amicus briefs

that makes the point that if a man is a serious candidate he
should have no trouble in finding *125 people who could
contribute a dollar each.
MR. ULLERICH:
your Honor.

We used that as an example, yes,

We are saying that — it was part of our point

that the personal wealth or the lack of property of the
individual should really not be that significant.

If he is

meeting in his locality, if he is gearing up to run for the
office, he really can go around and collect a dollar or two
from his supporters and if he is really a serious candidate,
that should not be an insurmountable burden to keep him off
the ballot.
Q

Well, I take it if he can't raise $425 and

plans to run for Congress, his candidacy is pretty well
foredoomed regardless of whether there is a filing fee or
not.

If he can't raise some money to conduct a campaign,

11
he isn't a serious candidate even though there were no
filing

fee.
MR. ULLERICII:

Yes, your Honor, we agree with that,

this is merely a threshold requirement really to test his
seriousness as to whether he is of sufficient backing in the
community to take a place on the ballot and we have to
consider also the various types of machine.

We don't have

one standard type of machine in California.

Some counties

have voting machines and some counties have votomatic-type
notebooks that open up and I think the number of candidates
and issues (that) appear on the ballot is a serious considera
tion nowadays.
You may have seen that when we had the primary in
California in 1972, due to the length of time it was taking
people to vote in San Francisco, the polls there remained
open an additional three hours to allow people to vote.

I

think that this sort of conduct —
Q

You couldn't chang e

MR. ULLERICH:

the length of the ballot

That was one of the considerations,

yes, the length of —
>

Q

You didn't gove a damn, did you?

MR. ULLERICH:

Well, as I said, the decision in

this case was on March 9th, 1972 and there was only a period
of 24 hours for people to learn about the decision.

The

members of the class represented by Appellee and go out and

12

obtain the papers from the county clerk, go out and get the
required numbers of signatures from their supporters and get
back in to the county clerks so we really haven't had a real
live experience.
Q

On your question of, if a man can't get enough

support, I might very well be willing to vote for you for
office, yet not be willing to give you a single nickel.
Right?
MR. ULLERICH:
Q

That's true, your Honor.

I might think you are the greatest man in the

world, but, I mean, I don't have any money

to hand around.

VJhat you really mean is, the man has to show that he
has financial support, not political support.
Am I right?
MR. ULLERICH:

I would be inclined to agree with

that and I also would add that the way that our election
system has been operating for a substantial period of time,
you really can't separate the two to determine a serious
candidate.
Perhaps if we had some other method of campaign
financing, we wouldn't have that problem, but the way that we
are set up at the present time, money and serious candidacy
appear to go hand in hand.
Q

Mr. Ullerich, where do the funds that are

collected through these fees go in California?

13
HR. ULLERICH:

In California there is a division

between the counties and the state for what we term state
or federal offices.

That is, the governor, the lieutenant

governor or the state assembly, the state senate, members in
Congress, these fees are actually collected by the county
clerks who are the ones who pass out the papers to the aspiring
candidate and those fees are then transmitted to the
California Secretary of State and they go into the state
treasury, basically.
For local candidates, candidates within a particular
county, the county supervisor, the district attorney, the
superior court judges —
Q

So they go into the general revenues.

MR. ULLERICH:

They would go into the general

county revenues and both the state and the county, to carry
that through, would have some substantial election expense,
probably the counties have more than the states because they
hire the election officers out at the precincts and print the —
Q

Well, now, there is an intimation in the

ACLU Amicus brief that never has there been an appropriation
of the fees made for the election commission.

Is this correct

or not?
MR. ULLERICH:

Well, this is hard to be specific,

your Honor, by pointing to a particular state budget for
this reason.

As the funds collected by the Secretary of State

14

for

candidate filing fees are delivered from his office into

the general fund, this commission that is referred to is
comprised of the Secretary of State, who is really our state
election official, the Attorney General and one other officer
and each of these three departments are funded by a preparation
from the general fund so you can’t earmark a particular -follow the candidate filing fee system into the general
treasury and out of the general treasury, but in a sense,
they go into the general fund and and funds come out of the
general fund to finance the operations of these particular
departments, so we can’t say X number of dollars has been
appropriated for that commission, no, your Honor.
Q

Did you take the same position in the District

Court as you did here?
MR. ULLERICH:

As you are doing here?
In the District Court, your Honor,

the matter moved very rapidly.

The case — well, the final

date for filing the declarations of candidacy was March the 10th
1972.

The complaint below was filed on March 3rd, one week

before, with a return to the
the 0th.

owner to show cause on March

Our office filed, in effect, a legal argument that

the contention — that the claim forward to state a claim upon
which relief could be granted and we cited legal authority and
also pointed out the matter of the budget of the Secretary of
State but it was basically a legal argument —
Q

So the District Court was part right ;*hen it

15

said5 "Since no showing has been made by the state concerning
either the necessity, the purpose, or the reasonableness of the
filing fee statutes in question, we conclude that they are
invalid."
MR. ULLERICH:
would be necessary.
Q

Well, I can’t agree to what showing

I think that this argument would —

Well, I'm just asking.

I'm just interested.

You didn't even make the argument or the showing that you are
now presenting here in this court.
MR. ULLERICH:

IJo, we made that argument.

We filed,

in the original record you will see we had Superior Court
cases in the state and the state —
Q

So you made the argument that this was

necessary to keep nonserious candidates off the ballot?
MR. ULLERICH:

That is correct, your Honor and we

cited various cases around the country —
Q

Well, then, what Is the source of this state­

ment, then, that you made no showing?

Is it that there

wasn't evidence introduced or something?
MR. ULLERICH:
think.

■ • • ‘i

That Is the only thing that I can

There was no evidentiary testimony taken in the

brief District Court proceedings as to perhaps experience.
:•

.

■ ')

...

The only thing I could think of would be experience that
we have had in cases where we didn't have the candidate filing
fees or statements of politicians as to what it takes to be a

16
serious candidate.

There is no such evidence presented, but

that was basically the same legal argument presented that we
were making here.
Q

All right, that’s what I wanted to know.

That

was what I wanted to know.
what
Q
Now,/Mr. Ullrich, rather fundamentally in this
case causes me concern, It is argued, as I understand It, in
both briefs and basically in your oral argument here, as
though the whole filing fee scheme had been struck down as
violative of the Equal Protection Clause and yet I understand
that all that the Court held was that an indigent, an indigent
or at least a functional indigent, a person who could not
afford personally to pay these fees, could not be required
to pay them.

Isn’t that the extent of the holding of the

Court?
MR. ULLRICH:

That was the extent of their

injunction, yes.
Q

Well, that is all, then, we are dealing with,

isn't it?
MR. ULLRICH:
Q

That —

In other words, analogizing It to Griffin

against Illinois, it I3 not a case where the whole filing fee
or requirement of a transcript to be paid for is struck down,
but just that it cannot be constitutionally applied to a
person who is absolutely indigent, or at least so absolutely

17
that he can't afford to pay these rather small fees.

Isn’t

that what is in this Court?
MR. ULLERICH:

That was the precise wording of

the injunction.
Q

Well, then, that is all we are dealing with,

isn't it?
MR. ULLERICH:

Well, I’m not so sure we are limited

to that because it seems to me if the statute is unconsti­
tutional as the Court predicated its decision, there is a
good argument that it should be unconstitutional as to all
cases submitted —
Q

Maybe that would be a good argument in some

other case, but in this case, isn't that all this Court held?
It is like Boddie against Connecticut didn't strike down
filing

fees for people who want to get divorces, but it

just said it could not be assessed against somebody who was
absolutely unable to pay them and filed an affidavit to that
effect.
MR. ULLERICH:

That was the precise holding of the

Court below.
Q

Well, it is argued here as

though the holding

was something quite different, I think.
MR. ULLERICH:
holding.

But, no — that was the precise

Well, what we are arguing about and the reason why

were perhaps broadened it is that we are concerned ivith this

18
distinction, really, that the Court is making between an
indigent gaining a place on the ballot through this means
devised by the Court as opposed to a hard-working employed
man who perhaps really has political ambitions and skill and
ability but because he has put aside a minimal amount of
money to send his children to college or to care for the
necessities of life and he wants to run for office, he is
going to have to pay this $425 filing fee —
Q

Well, that goes through American society,

hospitalization and everything else, but am I wrong in
thinking that the precise holding of this Court in this case
was not that the filing fees violate the Equal Protection
Clause but simply that it would violate the Equal Protection
Clause to require an Indigent to pay them?
Am I mistaken in this?
MR. ULLERICH:

I guess the terminology that the

Court would use, the Court would declare the statute
unconstitutional as applied to —
Q

If somebody filed an affidavit that he could

not pay them?
MR. ULLERICH:

That he did not personally have the

money or property to pay the candidate filing fee.
Q

Right,

Right.

Q

Even that is so limited, that doesn’t meet the

problem that you raise that there might be 66 candidates for

19
Congress on the ballot.

That doesn’t meet that problem,

does it?
MR. ULLERICH:

It certainly does not.

Let me give

another example as to where the decision below leaves us.
Shortly after that decision hit the newspaper, we had a letter
from a government teacher in high school who was very upset
that all of his 18-year-old students could not file for
county supervisor because they were very glad to file the
pauper's affidavit that they did not have sufficient money
or property and he thought it would be very good experience
for them to run for that office.
So I mean, this merely illustrates as to where this
decision leads us as far as recording the ballots or where
frivolous candidacy is concerned.

Q

The —

Attorney General, does California use for any

office the system that is prevalent In many states of
requiring petitions signed by a specified percentage of the
vote In the last election?
MR. ULLERICH:
have such a system.

California does not at this time

The —> 3ome of the lower or the Federal

District Court decisions have intimated that such an
alternative would be desirable.

I — I question as to whether

that is a surefire alternative means to the problems that we
express.

It may involve money to get a lengthy nominating

petition either to go out and hire somebody to gather the

20

signatures — we have this problem quite frequently In
California with our statewide initiatives.

You may have to

get someone to go out and stand in a shopping center to
collect these signatures and they might want some nominal
money to do that.
Q

I see.
«>

MR. ULLERICH:

Assuming you have a lengthy — there

may be some charge by the county clerks who will then have to
check those signatures to see if they are qualified signatures.
For instance, registered voters, to determine just who was
sagning these petitions.

There is some case law, for instance,

in New Mexico, the New Mexico Supreme Court pointed out that
they had tried this and it really wasn't very effective
because people have an inclination to sign anything whether
they really know the person and know whether he is a bonafide
candidate or not.

That also, again, I think is an element

of discrimination against the person who, for instance, is
employed and doesn't have the time to go out arid get the
signatures that the unemployed or the indigent person might
have and, of course, it will again open up the argument that
requiring a lengthy nominating petition of, say, 3»000
signatures might be a more onerous requirement that somebody
who is more affluent would be able to simply write out a
check, so I am not sure that that is a final solution.
I think it is something, certainly, more legislators,

21
including the State of California could seriously consider
but I don’t feel it is a matter of constitutional mandate
that every alternative has to be tried in cases such as this.
We didn’t dwell on this point too much in the
briefs , but the Bullock case decided last term concluded in
that case that because of the Texas candidate filing fee
system which basically was a fee which prospective candidates
couldn't know in advance, it was a fee determined by the
county political committee as an assessed cost of the total
cost of the primary election.

There is some suggestion in

that case that the strict standard of review may not apply in
those jurisdictions which have a more reasonable candidate
filing

fee.

I would really like to point out at this time that
I think that this problem that we have about if a case
involves an actual deprivation of voting 3uch as the durational
residency and those cases where the state has the burden of
justifying the statutes by a compelling public interest as
opposed to the old traditional rational basis test , it may
not be an either/or.

We really have the case here that

perhaps because there is some association of voters involved
there is, obviously, elections and some voting rights are
tangentially involved, that perhaps there really is a test
somewhere in between where there is neither a presumption
of constitutionality nor such an overwhelming burden on the

22

state to justify the statutes and I think we are saying, really,
under either of these three tests we think we have a
sufficient quantum of state interests to justify these laws
but we feel quite confident that the — this case really
doesn't fall in the same category as those cases which involve
an actual deprivation of voting rights so that terribly
stringent standards would be applicable.
Q

You think there may be as many as three

such tests?
MR. ULLERICH:

That is what I am really suggesting

that there might be —
Q

Do you think there might be more than that?

MR. ULLERICH:
Q

— the standard —

There could be an infinite number of tests,

I suppose, couldn't there?
MR. ULLERICH:
Q

Thatfs true.

Depending upon which test — if a majority of

the Court was — had decided to invalidate a state 'law they
would enunciate the test that was required to do so.
MR. ULLERICH:

Just one quick point, the amicus

brief that was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union
cited an intermediate Court of Appeals decision in California,
the Zapata, Z-A-P-A-T-A case which was decided last spring.
I really want to point out here that the California
Supreme Court granted a hearing in that matter and the case

23
was argued before the California Supreme Court on September
the 5th, 1972 and that Court has not issued a decision.

Under

California law, when the California Supreme Court grants

a

hearing, the intermediate Court of Appeal opinion is as dead
as anything can be and I can only guess that perhaps our State
Supreme Court is aware of this case and is deferring final
judgment as a pilot case, so that case has no authority.
Q

The Court didn’t wait for us on the capital

punishment case, did it?
MR. ULLERICH:

I — I really don’t mean to second-

guess that Court.
In conclusion, I merely want to say that I think a
substantial but a reasonable candidate filing

fee is

necessary to further the state interests that have been
averred to in many judicial decisions.

There may be other

means to accomplish those same goals, but we have practical
history in California for over 60 years and many other states
have fees that are in somewhat the same range.

They vary any­

where from one percent up to 5 or 6 percent but I believe these
other means are matters for legislative consideration.
We think the totality of the state interest that we
describe do justify our candidate filing fees under the
Equal Protection Clause.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Elman.

2H
ORAL ARGUMENT OP PHILIP ELMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEES
MR. ELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The essence of this case, as we see it, is that the
State of California bars a citizen from running for Congress
or for almost every other elective public office unless he
first pays to the state a substantial sum of money described,
perhaps euphemistically, as a filing fee.
In the Chief Justice's opinion for the Court last
term in Bullock, footnote 29, he indicates that the term
filing fee Is perhaps a misnomer since the amount of the fee
bears no relation whatsoever to the cost of filing or
processing the application.

It Is fixed rather on the basis

of a percentage, in the case of California, one or two percent
of the first year's salary for the office itself.
Q

Mr. Elman, I am sure you have read the Bullock

case more recently than I have in connection with this
argument but wasn't the vice In the Bullock case that Texas
was making the candidates in a primary bear the entire cost
of the election as distinguished from any filing processes?
Wasn't that the essence of the Bullock case?
MR. ELMAN:
Q

Well, your Honor, certainly the —

And it was delegated to the political parties

and not state officials.

25
MR. ELMAN:

I wouldn't presume to

tell the Court

what the essence of a case so recently decided was, even though
I have read it in the last few days.
Q

But aren't those the facts?

MR. ELMAN:

It was certainly a —• the Bullock case,

the Bullock case, like this case, embodies a number of facts
highly favorable to the candidate in attacking the consti­
tutionality of the filing

fee system.

In Bullock, perhaps,

the case was even stronger in that the fees were extraordinarily
large, particularly in relation to the local offices.
Q

$8,000 or $9,000 for some office holders.

MR. ELMAN:

County judge — county judge the fee

could be fixed as high as $8,900 and the two offices that
were particularly involved in the Bullock case, county
commissioner fee was $1,400 and county judge, another office
in another county was $6,300.
Now, the Court, as your Honor points out, emphasized
that the full burden of the costs of conducting the primary
election in Texas were imposed on the candidates and that had
the necessary consequence of making the size of the fees very
large and that was the factor, one of the factors, that x^as
stressed in the Bullock opinion.
The Bullock opinion went beyond that and, as we
read it, the Bullock case stands for the proposition that
where a filing fee is imposed by the state and xfhere it has

26
the effect of excluding candidates from access to the ballot
and thereby necessarily disenfranchising their supporters, if
a candidate is not on a ballot, his supporters have no
opportunity to vote for him and in a very real sense, their
right to vote in relation to them is not a meaningful,
effective right so that the Court in Bullock was dealing,
although the context factually was one with candidate filing
fees, with an impairment of the right to vote and it applied
to that classification based as it was upon wealth or the
lack of it, influent affluence, poverty, money, a classifica­
tion which the Court has held is a highly suspect one, a
classification which had as its necessary result the impinge­
ment of the fundamental constitutional rights for the political
association.
The Court applied the compelling interest test, held
that the state had not borne the heavy, if not impossible,
burden of justification that arises in such a case and held
it unconstitutional.
Now, in this case, the fees imposed by the State of
California are not as large.

The candidates are not required,

as in Texas —
Q

The case, Mr. Elman —

MR. ELMAN:
Q

Peg pardon, sir?

Am I correct in recalling that in the Bullock

case the Court invalidated the whole system of so-called

27
"filing fees" and by contrast, in this case, your brother has
confirmed my understanding that in this case all that was held
was that indigents could not be compelled to pray them, so
isn't this, instead of being a Bullock-like case, isn't this
more a Boddie-like case?
HR, ELMAN:

Boddie against Connecticut?

I’m not sure that the Bullock case can

be distinguished on that ground, your Honor, because as I
recall—
Q

What was the ultimate holding in the Bullock

ease?
HR. ELMAN:

The ultimate holding of the Bullock

case was that —■
Q

That scheme was invalid, wasn’t it?

MR. ELMAN:

Was the declaration by this Court that

the scheme was invalid.

Q

Here there is no such holding.

There is just a

holding that indigents can't be compelled to pay their fees.
MR. ELMAN:

The District Court — the District Court

dealt with this case on a basis of an application for a
preliminary injunction and the state is here appealing from —
Q

Right.

MR. ELMAN: — the preliminary injunction so that we
have not yet had a declaration of unconstitutionality by the
District Court.
Q

And the injunction -

28
MR. ELMAN:
Q

But hers —

Was granted only to those who filed affidavits

of —
MR. ELMAN:
Q

'That’s right.

— inability to pay, isn't it?

MR. ELMAN:

That’s right, but the injunction was

also so limited in the Bullock case.
Q

Was it?

MR. ELMAN:
Q

Yes, sir, as I recall.

I didn't know.

MR. ELMAN:

Unless my memory falls me very badly.

And, but the difference in the posture of the
cases, here the Court has before it an appeal by the state
from a preliminary injunction.

In Bullock it had an appeal

from a — by the state from a District Court declaring the
system unconstitutional — does permit the Court, if it so
chooses, to treat this case very narrowly and to — and to
deal only with the question of whether the California system
has applied to indigents' in its exclusion of indigent
candidates from the ballot, is unconstitutional, leaving
wholly open the question of the validity of this scheme as
applied to someone who is able to pay and is willing to pay
and so on.

In many cases —
Q

Maybe I have quite misunderstood the terms of

the preliminary injunction, but I had understood it the way

29

I indicated and that would — if I am correct in that, then,
then it would be equally applicable if the fee were just one
dollar a candidate across the board, if a person filed an
affidavit that I am sorry, I haven’t got a dollar, I am an
indigent, I can’t pay it, even though that were the fee, then
under the reasoning of Boddle, if it is applicable to this
situation, he could not be required to pay it.
MR. ELMAN:

Mr. Justice Stewart, let me — let me

hasten to say that you are right in your reading of the
preliminary injunction in this case.

It is limited to

application by —
Q

Then why —

MR. ELMAN:

— indigent candidates and I agree with

you, you do not have to go, and I am somewhat reluctant to
tell your Honors how far you can go or should go or are
required to go.
Q

Mr. Elman, could we treat it even more

narrowly than Justice Stewart has indicated and say simply
that simply this was a preliminary injunction that Bullock
afforded a reasonable argument for the Trial Court to grant
preliminary relief and not even pass on the constitutionality
in a final sense of the California system, even as applied to
indigents?
MR. ELMAN:

I can’t disagree with you on that.

If

the Court chooses to treat this case so narrowly as raising

30
only the question of whether the District Court was justified
on the basis of the preliminary showing made by the plaintiffs
and the response of the state to grant a preliminary injunction,
the state did come up here on a direct appeal.

The state

has argued the case as if it did squarely present the
constitutionality of the California system.

It is true that

there are cases right behind this one that are coming along,
that do raise the constitutionality of these candidate filing
fee systems.
The language of the Bullock case, stressing as it
did, and quite properly, the factual elements of that case»
including the element that the entire cost of the primary was
borne by the candidates, unlike the other states —
Q

Yes, but a political committee, not an official,

fixed the amount of the fee.
.MR. ELMAN:

Yes, that is right, sir.

Plus the fact that the Court did note probable
jurisdiction,

it did not affirm summarily, has led me as

Counsel for Appellee to suggest to the Court that while
affirmance is clearly required, there are several routes by
which you can reach that, from our standpoint,-desirable
conclusion and one of the routes ~ one of the routes is
clearly marked out by, as Mr, Justice Stewart has suggested,
by cases in this area, the principal one being Harper against
Virginia Borad of Elections involving a fee of one dollar and

31
fifty cents where the Supreme Court held that the payment of
any fee in any amount —
Q

By anybody.

MR. ELMAN:

— by anybody — thank you ■— was a

violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment
so whether it is $425

in the case of a man running for

Congress or $850 for a candidate for the Senate or $982 for —
in the case of a candidate for governor» if — if the fee
cannot be justified by a legitimate state interest, regardless
of the amount, it is unconstitutional and that would — that,
if the Court —■
Q

Well, if the fee can be justified as against

those who can afford to pay the fee, it nonetheless

might

violate Equal Protection to charge it against somebody who
could not possibly comply with the law because he is absolutely
indigent, wouldn’t it?
MR, ELMAN:
Q

According to the Harper case, the —

Even though court fees are presumably justified,

we held in Boddle that they couldn’t be assessed against
somebody who absolutely was unable to pay them.
Q

That is right.

MR. ELMAN:

It doesn’t mean that court fees are not

wholly justified.
Q

Well, it depends on the basis upon which the

filing fee requirement is struck down.

In Boddie, as in, even

32
in Griffin» the defendants In criminal cases who can afford to
pay the transcripts of the record were required to do so.
In Boddle and in Griffin and in cases of that
category, in the Crass which was up here earlier this term, you
are dealing with — you are dealing with requirements made by
the state which are valid as applied to nonindigents.

But

when you are dealing with a fee on the act of voting as in
Harper, then as I read the cases, the holding that the fee is
unconstitutional applies not only to those who are too poor to
pay the fee, but to those who have no difficulty paying it.
Q

Mr, Elman, you, I think, in your brief, have

made a point of the lack of any alternative on the part of the
indigent person who wants to be a candidate.
Would you think, for example, that if in the
California statute they provided that an indigent who could
not pay or possibly that as an alternative for any person
paying

$425,

you hay^e a petition signed by 425 registered

voters in the jurisdiction before a notary public requiring or
requesting that he be placed on the ballot.
would be a reasonable alternative?

Do you think that

Constitutional

alternative?
MR. ELMAN:

Your Honor, I would say that any re­

quirement imposed upon any candidate, in order to test his
seriousness, should be imposed on all candidates regardless of
how much money they do or do not have.

33
Q

Are you saying that as a matter of policy or

constitution?
MR. ELMAN:
constitutional law.

I am asserting that as a matter of
As a matter of constitutional principle,

you can’t classify — you cannot — excuse me, your Honor.
Q

That's all right, go ahead.

MR. ELMAN:

If I may finish the sentence.

As a matter of constitutional principle, when you
are dealing with the right of franchise, you cannot separate
voters on the basis of money.

That is the proposition I put

to the Court as simply and as bluntly as I can and if you —
if an Indigent candidate for Congress is subjected to the
burden of going around collecting signatures and a rich
candidate is not subjected to that burden, I would -submit to
your Honors that that i3 a denial of the equal protection of
the lav/s.
Q

But you have one problem, constitutional

problem, with a statute that required every candidate to file
one percent of the voter’s of the last preceding election for
the 3ame office, for example.
MR. ELMAN:

Not only do I have no objection to that,

I have suggested that In the case of Jermess against Fordson,
in ^03 U.S., vrhere Georgia had a requirement that 5 percent of
the eligible voters at the last election be required to
sign petitions in order to get the candidate on the ballot

34
was a valid one, upheld by the Count.
Now, that requirement didn't — xuasn't made on the
basis of money or race or color or some other classification
which this Court has rejected as intolerable in relation to
fundamental constitutional rights like voting and political
association
Q

and free speech.

Now —

Mr. Elman, I am sure you have had enough

experience in these matters to agree that probably if there
were such a requirement that the courts would soon be
confronted with the claim that for an indigent person the
requirement of getting one percent, two percent or five
percent of the signatures on a petition is costly and burden­
some and therefore it should be waived with respect to
indigents.
MR. ELMAN:
the future.
Q

That is one question I would leave to

I certainly wouldn't decide that one froday.
I think we will leave it there, top;, but I

agree that that is inherent in this kind of problem.
MR. ELMAN:

I think it may very well arise, but I

think that if, as we urge, a state candidate filing' fee
system which excludes candidates from the very political
process which lies at the heart of our constitutional system
which closed the door to them at the threshold simply on the
basis of money, if such systems are struck down, the
participation of poor candidates and poor voters in the

35
political processes which may result as a consequence of that
action, would, I would quote, minimize the kinds of cases
which were increasingly coining before the Court now in which
indigency is being asserted as a basis for unconstitutional
classification.
Q

Mr. Elman, if you regard the answer to the

Chief Justice’s question as an open one, that is that perhaps
ultimately it would follow that not only a, money filing fee
would be struck down, but that a petition signature-collecting
requirement would be struck down, then in effect the state
could do nothing constitutionally to prevent every highschool
civics student from running for supervisor, as Mr. Ullerieh
suggests.
MR. ELMAN:

I wasn’t suggesting that the question

raised by the Chief Justice should be answered one way or
the other.

I was suggesting only that that question

seemed

to me so remote that it should not be dealt with her and that
I was hoping that a clear-cut decision by this Court affirming
not on the narrow ground that has been suggested but on the
broad ground that any filing fee, no matter how reasonable or
valid in relation to non-indigents, is unconstitutional
because it isn’t supported by any legitimate state interest,
whether it is a compelling state interest or otherwise.

The

notion, the notion that the seriousness of a candidate should
be measured by the size of his purse, that you equate

36
seriousness of purpose politically with how much money you
have, is absolutely contrary to everything this Court has
ever said.
Q

Would you concede for the purpose of your

argument here that the state does have a legitimate interest
in somehow minimizing the choice the electors have to make
from among the potential candidates for an office, that you
v/ouldn’t want 60 candidates for county supervisor on a
primary ballot?
MR. ELMAN:

Yes, your Honor, the Court has stated

in Jenness and Fordson;

it has restated it in the Bullock

case that the state certainly has a legitimate interest in
protecting the integrity of the ballot in weeding out frivolus
fraudulent candidates and preventing the ballot from becoming
so overcrowded that voters are confused, et cetera, et cetera.
That certainly is a legitimate interest of the state
My point is that the way to weed out the frivolous,
fraudulous candidate isn’t to subject him to a financial means
test.
Q

What is it?

MR. ELMAN:
Q

Beg pardon?

What would a way of doing it be?

MR. ELMAN:

Well, you — you suggested that, your

Honor in your opinion —
Q

In Jenness.

37
MR. ELMAN:
Q

In Jenness.

Well —

MR. ELMAN:
Q

IP you ~

— Georgia suggested it.

I just said it ^tfas

a pretty good and valid suggestion.
MR. ELMAN:

Well, I think the — I think your

statement of it, from my point of view, carries more weight.
The —> if the test is, is he a serious candidate,
does he have a significant modicum of voter support, if that
is the test, you don't — you don't apply it on the basis of
a money yardstick.

Now, a money yardstick, while it may keep

out the poor candidate who isn't a serious candidate in the
sense that he may not win the election, does not keep out the
nonserious

fraudulent fictitious candidate who i3 motivated
Q

To advertise his automobile business, for

example and may have plenty of money.
MR. ELMAN:

Is that your point?

That is one kind of fraudulent
i

candidate.

;

You may have a fraudulent candidate —■
Q

He may not be a fraudulent candidate, but his

purpose in getting on the ballot and running is to advertise
his used car business.
MR. ELMAN:

There is no limit to meritricious

motives of — the candidate may be on the ballot simply
because he has the same name or a very closely similar name
as somebody else.

Now, if he has enough money, California

38
will put him on the ballot.

If he doesn't have the money,

even though he is a serious candidates like Mr. Chcte,

he is

off the ballot.
Nowa in regard to some of these abstract questions,
may I state the facts concerning Mr. Chote

which are a matter

of public record?
He Is unemployed.

He has no — he has proceeded in

this Court and the Court below and he is in forma pauperis.
He filed the necessary affidavits in the District Court that
although he was a qualified candidate for Congress, he had
no funds.
Q

What election is he a qualified candidate for

now?
MR. ELMAN:
Q

Well —

I mean, was he put on the ballot In the last

election?
MR. ELMAN:

He was put on the ballot by order of the

District Court, the decree of the District Court which the
state is here appealing from.
Q

Last summer?

MR. ELMAN:

He ran in the 17th Congressional District

in California, the district that is represented by Congressman
McCloskey.

He ran in the Democratic Primary.

He got on the

ballot because a three-judge Federal District Court ordered
the state to put him on and that is how he got on there.

Q

Well, that cost him money, from an economist's

1J0

point of view.
MR. ELMAN:
Q

It was an expenditure of —

Yes.

MR. ELMAN:

— of a sort which I think — I think

the Constitution and the First Amendment tend to encourage
and to preclude people like Mr. Chote

from access to the

ballot, from participating in the political processes, to
uphold the position of the state in this case would mean that
if the Constitution tolerates disenfranchisement of the poor,
that it permits, it sanctions keeping the poor, who we know
are the most

apathetic group of the electorate from having a

stake in the process, from participating in it.
Now, there have been several arguments made by the
state in the course of the brief.

I don't know, whether I

should burden your Honors with any further argument-.
There is a suggestion, well, if any candidate is
a serious candidate for Congress, he can certainly raise
$*125.

If he doesn't have the money himself, if he has got any

serious support, why doesn't he go down and push doorbells and
get a dollar from each voter?
Now, consider the implications of that.

The state

is telling this Court that in order for voters to get their
candidate on the ballots, they can exercise their right to
vote for him, they may be required to pay one dollar in the
way of a fee or a tax.

How, if that isn't — that's Harper against Virginia
Board of Elections with a vengeance.

There, at least, the

state had a poll tax that everybody had to pay.

But the

State of California would be requiring these *525 people, in
order to vote for their candidate, to pay a poll tax.

It

would be selective and discriminatory and, while I haven;t
suggested it in the brief, I think it would clearly also
violate the 24th Amendment which makes it clear that the
candidates for — which makes it clear that v/ith respect to
voting in federal elections, neither the United States nor the
state can impose any poll tax or any other tax and I don't
think calling this a filing fee precludes or concludes the
constitutional question of whether it constitutes a tax on
the privilege of voting.
Q

Would you concede, Hr. Elman, that this

statute of California, like any statute of any state, comes
to this Court or any court with a presumption that it is
constitutionally valid?
HR. ELMAN:

Yes, indeed.

I would also state what

doesn't have to be stated to your Honors that ever since that
famous footnote in Caroline Products, when you are dealing with
fundamental constitutional rights like freedom of speech and
rights of voting, there has been an awful lot of law as to the
burden that rests upon the state and as recently as
Mr. Justice Blackmun's opinion for the Court in Rowe against

Wade , it was stated that when fundamental rights are
concerned, any regulation — fundamental constitutional rights
are concerned, any regulation of the state must •—
Q

Is it constitutionally invalid?

MR. ELMAN:

No, not at all, that a heavy burden

of justification rests upon the state and •—
Q

Well, once you say that --

MR. ELMAN:
Q

I didn’t —

— do you know of any opinion which uses the

phrase heavy burden of justification or close judicial
scrutiny or a compelling state interest?
phrases?

Any of those three

Any opinion of this Court in which the decision

is other than to hold the statute invalid?
MR. ELMAN:

Well, for example, I think Mr. Justice

Marshall’s opinion for the Court last year in either Dunn and
Blumsteln or Chicago Police against Mosley, in talking about
the burden on the state, says that regardless of how you
phrase the standard —
Q

That the burden is on the state, isn't that

right?
MR. ELMAN:

It puts the burden of justification on

the state where the classification— where the classification
impinges upon First Amendment or voting rights.
Q

Where is the First Amendment right here?

MR. ELMAN:

Oh, the First Amendment right In this

43
case is the right of political association.

The support is

the candidate •— who associate for the purpose of supporting
him.

You certainly have the right to vote —
Q

Not the right to vote.

MR. ELMAN:

You have the right to vote which comes

from Article One, Section two.
Q

Well, no, but if you have ever read Miner

against Haperstadt, it holds that there is no constitutional
right to vote and if that hadn’t been true, there would have
been no need to have a 19th Amendment to the Constitution
giving women the right to vote.

You would agree with that,

wouldn't you?
MR. ELMAN:

I've read as recently as Harper

against Virginia Board of Elections citing the classic case
that the right to vote in federal elections comes from
Article one, Section two of the Constitution of the United
States.
Q

Are you familiar — Mr. Justice Frankfurter,

it is one of his favorite law review articles, other than
those of which he himslef had been the

author — it was a

famous one in the Harvard Law Review that he once told me he
had required all his law clerks to read when they first came.
Was it by Thayer, in the Harvard Law Review?
MR. ELMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

of any statute?

I was about to say that

but I was afraid that I would be wrong.
Q

What about 37?

MR. ELMAN:
Q

It’s around 37.

Thank you.

MR. ELMAN:

Thank you very much, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further?

Do you have anything

You have just a couple of minutes?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY G. ULLERICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ULLERICH:

Only on the question of Roadie

versus Connecticut which came up and as I recall, that was
the case where the fundamental relationship of divorce,
certain people would not have to pay the court filing fees
in order to get access to the Court.
It seems to me that the state interest In that
case was merely the loss of a very nominal amount of
revenue to process the actual papers.

I think the state

interests are substantially different in this case because of
the ballot control fragmentation of vote and so forth.

It Is

really not Just the matter of the state is only losing the
$*}25 fee, it is the matter of the effective control of the
ballot.
Q

Actually, that case was decided under a

different porvision of the Constitution than the one at issue
here.
MR. ULLERICH:

The due process.

That’s right,

your Honor.
I have nothing further.
Q

But it may be that you can say the state has

a legitimate interest in doing — well, a legitimate interest
in limiting the ballot.

But don't you also have to demonstrate

that what you are doing contributes to that end, substantially
contributes to that end.

Your opponent argues that it

doesn’t contribute anything to that end, really, because any­
body with money can get on whether he is serious or not.
And the people who can’t afford it may be kept off
even if they are quite serious.
MR. ULLERICH:

Well, I think that would be true if

you talk about the $10 or $15 fee, your Honor, but I think If
you are talking about what we terra have been judicially
declared —
Q

But If it is so easy — if it is so easy, the

state end isn’t served anyway.
MR. ULLERICH:

Well, v/hat I am saying is that if

we are talking about $400 or $500, I think the stripteaser or
the car salesman, for instance, is going to think twice before
they use that as a mode of advertisement or public relation­
ship, even if they have the money to pay.

It has to be large

enough to discourage that type of candidacy.

I think $400 to

$500 is.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Elman, you came here

at our request and by our appointment, and on behalf of the
Court, I want to thank you for your assistance to the client
in the case and your assistance to the
MR. ELMAN:

Court.

Thank you very much, sir.

submitted.)
