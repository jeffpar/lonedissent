ORAL ARGUMENT 0? HOWARD SCUULKAN, ESQ.,
ON B&HALF OF THE PETITIONEES
MR. SCHll'LMANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Although arising within the context of an

internal

abor matter—and it could arise in any variety of contexts—
the fundamental issue present here is whether courts may
fashion.and utilise the extraordinary remedy of awarding
counsel fees in statutory actions to successful .litigants,
notwithstanding that Congress, which provided the right and
remedy, has not expressly authorised counsel fee awards.
The facts very briefly as found by the trial court
was that Mr., Cole, the respondent, was a. member of the
petitioning union, and his union for many years, a score of
years in fact, competed with another union for membership and
job rights for American unlicensed seamen.

These- two unions

represented generally all the American unlicensed seamen.
The other union in the late 1950's and early 196'0’s
:i repetlti.cn of conduct which had been going by both sides

pyortunities in particular fleets away from the petiti. cning

Jtivities, it was found, if
mccessfut; would seriously adversely affect both the
employment rights, pension rights, welfare, vacation
rights of the members of the petitioning union.

And the

petitioner hero - then acted to repel these raids, and pursued
certain activities.
In connection with the activities of his union,
i-fen Cole was opposed to it, proposed a resolution at a
union meeting condemning his union’s defense against such
raids and the activities and the methods it used, resorted to,
to defend against it.

There were two fundamental reasons

for it, as he expressed.
First, they infringed upon his employment rights,
which in the maritime industry is called shipping rights.
Secondly, it was contrary to what he had expressed.

It was

his general trade union concepts that union people should not
fight with each other.
He then, to implement this philosophy, introduced
e. resolution at a union membership meeting, which was
overwhelmingly rejected by his fellow members.

In fact,

just two votes were cast with his own vote and someone who
seconded it.
As a consequence of these activities, which the
union felt threatened its vary existence, internal union
charges wares filed against Mr. Cole.

He received notice.

is the testimony.

It was sent to the general

membership—--ant their membership meets in a peculiar manner
at meetings, not one meeting.

There are meetings held all

over the country because of the nature of the calling,

As a consequence of that, he appealed.

A motion was made for

Our position the district court sat

on for X think close to four months, three and a half, four
months, and than issued an injunction reinstating Mr. Cole
to membership.
Appeal was had as a consequence, and the decision
was affirmed.

The complaint was amended, -and in 1965—* this

was almost three years already—an amended answer was
interposed.

Then the counsel for plaintiff failed to observe

local court rules, and the case was marked off the calendar

1368, ancl tried in January, 1970.

found that as continued by this union the respondent's

of t:ay very well .reduce the union treasury and the membership.
Ne-ortheless, the. court said, Mr. Cole’s activities ware
projected under the act,- and that the proviso which is in

the faction 101(a)(2), which says that each member of the
unreal shall nave a responsibility toward the union as an
iuccxtufcion—the court said in this particular case that
proviso was inapplicable as the same was not intended to
discourage Mr. Cole’s activities merely because the ultimate
result would not benefit his union.
The court further found no evidence to support the
trral committee's findings that respondent violated the
union constitutional provisions as charged.

They submit

chis was prior to tills Court's decision in Hardeman.

And the

district court found respondent sustained no damage at all

■■■3 a result of his expulsion, that every one of his rights
prior to the temporary injunction—that almost 14 month
perica oetween expulsion and injunction-—each and every one of
.a:.,u rights was assured? his employment, his insurance and
vulture .benefits remained unimpaired.

And, in fact, in 1967

r u Cole retired and is presently receiving a pension, $250

7
pot month, from the Joint Union Management tension Fund.

And.

his wife, as the trial showed, had received'about the time
•-"»f the trii\l almost $4,500 in some welfare medical payments.
She had been seriously ill.
Q

What about the period between the time of his

termination and the time of the district court judgment?

MR. SCHULMAN:
Q

Everything all right, Your Honor.

Me was—

MR. SCHULMAN:

He was accorded every single right

and that is what the court found.
Q

That included back payments?

MR. SCHULMAN;
Q

I do not understand.

You say he has been receiving a pension.

MR. SCHULMAN:

Oh, he retired in 1967 and since

167 to date ha has been receiving a pension.

Prior to that

he had been actively employed.
Q

He would not have received that, absent the

district court judgment? is that correct?
MR. SCHULMAN:

No, he would have received it

anyway.

Q

He would have received it in any event?

MR. SCHULMAN:

Yes, in any event, he would have

received it. • In other words, there was no discrimination
against him in any shape, manner or form, and that is what
the court found.

8
Q

What, do you say the court's relief consisted

Of?
MS„ 3CHULMAN:

The court's relief—-the court went

on to make, as I say, some very significant findings.

The

court went on further and said that all the defendants in
this case acted in good faith and believed they had a right
to do what they did to protect their organisation.

The

court further concluded there was no malice at all,
absolutely no malevolence by any of these officers.

The

court, in fact, did not find, as the Third Circuit decision
in Gartner which the court relied upon for the award of
attorneys * fees—in this case the court did not find that
the plaintiff acted in good faith, a significant finding in
the Gartner case, but it found, on the contrary, that his
complaints and his grievances and his accusations were in
part motivated by desire, political ambition for office.
All causes of actions were dismissed against all
individual defendants, and the court granted a mandatory
injunction against the union, requiring the reinstatement
permanently of Mr. Cole.
Then it came to the issue of attorneys' fees, which
is the issue before this

Court.

The court said, based upon

th* authority of Gartner v. Salorxsr, 384 Fed. 2nd, Third
Circuit,- that the court had authority under Section 102 of
the act to award the counsel fees.

9
q

This is th-3 district court?

MR. SCHULMAR:

This is the district co-art,

l-ir„ Justice Rehnguist, yes.
Aid that in addition to that, the absence of
express statutory provisions authorising attorneys’ fees
dues not stop the court in a case such as that for

awarding

attorneys* fees, relying upon this Court’s decision in
Mills.
Q

I expecting also pointing out that general

provisions, such relief as my be appropriate or something
like that.
ME. SCHULMAN:
Q

Hot the district court.

MR. SCHULMAN:
Q

He did not say that.

Not the

district court.

That was the court of appeals.

MR. SCHULMAN:

The court of appeals fundamentally

affirmed and said as may be appropriate, as you just said,
Mr. Justice Brennan.
It appears to us that present here is a determination
and a fundamental decision which is contrary to a very long
established rule.

I think it is in 1784.

And that is that

ordinarily attorneys’ fees are not awarded absent express
statutory authority, and the court has used express
.statutory . authority# or a contract providing therefor,
there have been exceptions; we will come to them in a

I need not belabor the

There is no express provision for it other than to

point out, as this Court has pointed out in the
Fleischmann case, Congress is not reluctant.

When Congress

wants to award attorneys’ fees in express statutory action,
it says so.

The footnote, IS I believe it is, in

Fleischmann.
As more recently, Title II, Civil Rights Law,
Fair Housing Law.

There is no question that when Congress

wants it done, it knows how to say it.

In fact, in this

statute, as we shall come to, it so expressly stated in
certain instances.
Wien we examine the legislative history and the
derivation, we find the bill started, as this Court knows,

But

under his bill of rights, Section 102 and 103, fhare wsra two
provisions.

One, it was that the Secretary of Labor is

authorised to apply for such relief as may be appropriate.
And the second was a criminal provision, penal provision.
Sections 102 and 103—-at that time 102 in

the McClellan

A debate ringed in the Senate on this point as to
tii.problem which would be attended if the Secretary of
Labor vas to be the one to initiate and process these sort
of matters.
The consensus was finally arrived at through? an
amendinent by Senator Kuchel.

And Senator Kuchel * s amendment

in substance substituted for the Secretary of Labor as the
party to seek the relief the private party affected.

And,

:: ic legislative history shows, done solely to avoid
bureaucratic chaos, absolutely no intent to provide for
attorneys * teas and certainly no one can seriously contend
that the Secretary of Labor, if successful, would be
entitled to attorneys' fees.
Section 102 in the Senate bill as passed then went
over to the House.

On the House side, Senator Goldwater

took the xuusual step of appearing before the House Committee
on Education and Labor, and explained to them the meaning
ci the language- which was utilized and specifically pointed

Q

Mr. Schulman, did the Senator carry his

argument to the Senate?
MR. SCHTJLMMTt

Dio, he did not carry it to the

Senate,
Q

Which was his own house.

MR, SCHULM&N:

Which was his own house, that is

correct, Mr. Justice.
Q

Xs there anything indicative in that fact?

MR. SCHULMAN;

Wo, there is—X think the manner

in which the debate occurred brought this about, because the
Kuchel amendment to 102 did not come out of a committee; it
cams right up on the floor over this problem of bureaucratic
chaos.

And we have been unable to ascertain any discussion

on the Senate side relative to providing for attorneys’
fees.
We do, however, call this Court’s attention to the
fact that this issue in substance was before this Court in
the Hardeman case.
vU'fth Sonator Goldwater went over before the House,
vt ■

ee to

whole series of items which the Senate

13

As this Court said, it was an

aufchoritative analysis of tits } anguage in the Hardeman casts.

Section 104.

He discussed

in fact, as a consequence of his testimony,

the Senate bill,.Section 104, which was the exhaustion
provision and was a sixth month period, was reduced to four
months.
Q

Reduced by the House?

MR. SCHULMAN:.* The House bill then contained four
months and in committee accepted as four months.
Q

Do you think that Senator Goldwater’s position

Q

2 got

osi© impression, Mr. Schulman, out of

this record—and yen perhaps can clarify it for roe—that
the legislative history suggests that one of the reasons
why they eld not affirmatively provide for attorneys" fees
is that there

was some thought that the statute without

that explicit provision was broad enough to give very broad
relief.
MR. SCHULMAN:

I will direct myself, Mr. Chief

Justice, to that question.

There is nothing at all by any

contender of this bill saying that their language will
encompass attorneys' fees.

Someone must only assume that.

Overt there is nothing in it.

In fact, it is pointed out,

as 3. shall come, to in a moment, after Senator Goidwater
concluded histestimony, and Senator McClellan equally
testified, if I recall in the Hardeman brief presented to
this Court, Senator McClellan took a similar position to
Senator Goldwater.

After that testimony there was reported

the Mlliott Bill in the House on the Senate's bill.

The

Elliott Bill, after reported, did not succeed, and a
verity l:ymo report was filed in substance saying, as I

15
&v.:s it, that, there is ,;.o provision for attorneys * fees.
However», the Elliott Bill could not command a
majority, and Congressmen Landrum and Griffin proposed their
bill,

.tut the provision with respect to attorneys’ fees,

which was a House minority dissent, could not command a
majority of the House, and the bill as it came out took
Section 102 of the House bill, the Kuehel Amendment, with
one change not significant here-—the conference report
parenthetically inserted the words "including injunctions!' —
Q

There had been an earlier draft in the House

that specifically provided for attorneys’ fees, but it failed
and the bill that came out of the House did not provide.
MR. SCHULMANi

That is not so, Mr. Justice.

No

bill as such—either the Elliott Bill or Landrum-Gr.iffin
Bill as such—provided for the authorisation expressly of
attorneys5 fees.
Q

Neither bill did.

Was there a difference bstx«;een the Elliott

draft and the ultimate Landrum-Griffin Bill?
MR, SCHULMMf:

No.

Both accepted in substance the

Kuehel Amendment.
Q

And neither dealt with attorneys'1 fees?

MR. SCHULMAN:
fees.

And neither dealt with attorneys*

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
But there are equally significant issues in this

matter.

In the debate on the House, Congressman Griffin

16

stated, directing his attention to t

original

McClellan provision which provided for penal remedies, said,
''Look, the kind that we are talking about here is comparable
to

Taft-Hartley unfair labor practice charges.

comparable conduct.
Tot that.

That is a

And there are no criminal penalties

There is accepted, generally accepted, provisions

and they axe all civil."

And this was his understanding,

one of the sponsors, ,of the conduct which sought to be
remedied here.

And I think this is as far back as 1941.

It

has been determined that the only compensatory or other
damages of any kind available in unfair labor practice
charges is lost time, compensatory damages.
And I think equally significant is that when we
turn again to the provisions itself of the act and track it,
We find, very significant language, the identical language
which appears in 102 and which I say rejects any inference
that attorneys*fees—first were not even expressly
authorized~"were even inferentially authorised.
And X am referring to the following.

The language

used in Section 102, such relief as may be appropriate,
When we examine Title II, which is the provision of the act
which provides for filing reports, responsibilities and .so
forth, the enforcement provision of that is the identical
.language, the Secretary of Labor being the enforcement
officer.

’ere we have Congress using this same language.

17
. u! we are now asked to say it means one thing here, it
means another thing here.
Now we go to Title III and we find the saraa thing
in the enforcement provision with respect to that matter
which

in substance is the same context and used again for

individuals to exercise their rights,

Again, you have to

have a different meaning for the same language»
And when we go to Title V—which is very
significant, that is the fiduciary, that is the akin to the.
Mills case

which is property rights—and when they come to

that section, Congress specifically said appropriate relief
plus accounting, damages, and attorneys' fees,

I think when

you track that language it becomes very significant that not
only was it not expressed, nor can it be inferred.,
The question of inferring, just to direct a few
moments to, it appears—
Q

If I may interrupt you again, Mr, Schulraan—

MR. SCIIULMAN:
Q

Yes» Mr. Chief Justice»

—I think I put my finger on what raised this

subject in my mind.

Congressman Elliott apparently in

debate responding, it would seem in this context, to this
problem about fees said that the court's jurisdiction "to
grant such other and further relief as may be appropriate"
g.i' is it wide latitude to grant relief according to the
neveesities of the case to cover any loss suffered by members.

18
MR. dC/IUIllAM:

Yes, that language referred to, but
th respect to

attorneys ’ fees, and it rose within a context—
Q

Was that not a response to a suggestion, or in

the general context of the debate about adequacies of the
bill?
MR. SCHULMAN:

It would appear to me that if I were

to make an objection that there were not provisions for
attorneys' fees and that that was intended as a reply,
•certainly the inference would be this is broad enough to
cover everything, including attorneys1 fees.

We must guess

ar,-/. hypothecate whether or not that was intended for that
purpose.

And it appears to me
Q

hen you have—

His views, if any of these views carry any

weight, his views would be of more utility than the views of

Sponsors.

No, because his bill was never

Congressman Elliott's bill was not adopted.

It

war the Landrum-Griffin Bill that was adopted, which was
substituted for the Elliott Bill in the House, and that is
what happened.

The Elliott Bill could not command a majority,

you have that discant to it? and you therefore had, then,
car ire/ up the Aaudrum-Griifin Bill which apparently could

19
command a majority with :

the minority

revert that it does not provide for attorneys' fees.

And

that is how it came through.
X would like, if I may, just direct a few of my
remarks or X can maintain a few minutes for rebuttal with
respect to the Mills decision and the exceptions provided
therein,.

The judge created exceptions.
What we are talking about, first of all, when we

examine this statute, we find it falls foursquare within
this Court's decision in Fleischraann.

When you look at this

legislative scheme, Title 1, II, right through, Congress
lays out the rights.

Congress provides the remedies.

it wants attorneys' fees, it says attorneys' fees.

When

When it

describes the nature of accounting, it says accounting.

It

lays it out within what I think Flelsehraann says are the
boundaries' which Congress intended to be utilized.
And then we come to the exceptions. And the Mills
case fundamentally is discussing a property right, a
stockholders right.

I must call attention to one fact.

Mills case per se is not an express statutory right.

The

In

fact, this Court specifically said that the only right under
Section 14(a) of the Security Exchange Act was a declaration
avoidance, leaving to this Court the obligation to imply a
right.

And obviously when the Court implies a right, of

no .a;, is city it mart mo Jo • come provision how that right will

20
.ho implemented, hew it will be enforced, and that is the
remedy.
The Mi11s decision does not apply here.
a property right case.

This is not

In fact, Section SO

which is the akin fco Mills, the derivative stockholders
action, property held by a third party, acted upon
improperly, the therapeutic purpose of that, Congress was
specific,

it said that is a breach of fiduciary obligation.

That is 501.

And specifically said, "We shall give in that

instance reasonable attorneys' fees."
As it appears to me, this does not fall within one
of the exceptions.
it is.

The legislative history sets forth what

There is no express provision under these circum­

stances, I think, to permit in a case such as this where
Congress has not expressly provided attorneys' fees and
in effect said equity, you have equitable powers and you can
grant attorneys' fees and .1 think will be applicable to most
any • litigation, any statute enacted, and I think would
vitiate a rule which we have had since 1789.

And if that

is to be vitiated, it is the function of Congress? it is a
plenary power.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Schuiman.

'-KAI: ARGUMENT OP BURTON H. HALL, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
HALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
l would like" to go back to the facts just briefly

fcc. correct what I believe to be some errors in my friend's
presentation.
Mr. Cole introduced his resolution at a union
meeting—at a meeting in 1962»
introduce it.

He was fully in order to

He was declared to be in order.

however, allowed to read it.

He was not,

It was read in garbled fashion

by one of the officials of the union.

The head of the union

then took the floor and denounced him as an ingrate and a
variety of other bad things.

He was not allowed to answer.

The motion was put to a vote.

He and his seconder

were the only ones who dared put up their hands in favor of
it.
i think that reveals not only the nature of how
this union’s internal affairs have been run in recant years;
it also reveals the nature of the benefit that this suit
has conferred upon the union and upon the' membership.
According to the union officers themselves, those
offi-.^rs believed—and they say they believed it in good
faith
t- ■

.nd there has been a finding below to that fact*—that
a r

:>.

/. xaeJtiber who introduces a resolution critical

22

i

of them at a union meeting,

if they believed it, the

s a crab e r s mu s t h ave believed it also or believed that they
wore not secure in their ordinary democratic rights
guaranteed them by the Bill of Rights title of this actf
Landrum-Griffin Act.
This was already three years after the LandrumGriffin Act had gone into law.

It was more than four years

after the State of New York Court of Appeals, the highest
court of the state, had declared in very clear language that
public policy requires that union members be protected in
their rights to express views and opinions critical of the
union’s leadership and its officers, even when the criticism
is hard-hitting and ardent.
Despite all this and despite the fact that the union
was represented and is represented by very able counsel, the
union officers insist they still believed they could freely
expel a man.

What is more, they must have believed they

could expel him on no evidence whatsoever, because their
trial committes was unable to find any evidence whatsoever
to support the charges that Cole had maliciously vilified
the union president.
One more point on this.

The resolution was

critical of certain violations of the union’s established
shipping procedure and called for more regularized hiring.
This relates to the union's practice or the union officers’

v.v:u-rcJ.ce of raiding other maritime unions.

The reason it

.^elated is rather complicated
In addition to the ordinary picketing that the
•anion carried on from time to time by membership approval,
the officers were leading men in what was called voluntary
ticketing and rewarding the—which involves disputes that
the union was not a party to and which had not been approved
by the union membership.

It was rewarding this voluntary

picketing by giving or shipping men off their voluntary
picket lines, and that was one of the variations—in fact,
it was the chief variation—«from the established shipping
rules that Mr. Cole was

complaining about.

His motives in introducing the resolution are
there right on the face of the resolution.

Mr. Cole

testified as to his motives, and it is clear* that his
motives, the motives that he testified to, are exactly the
same as the motives that are indicated by the resolution
itself; namely, he wanted more regularized hiring, and he
wanted to end this dog-eat-deg warfare between sister unions
where one union, in particular this union, would raid another
union by offering*—by sending strike breakers through the
other union's picket lines, by offering men to work at
lower wages and under worse conditions than the other union

He was put, through the

appearance of a trial committee which, as I say, could find
no evidence or could produce in its report, no evidence of any
malicious vilification on his part or of any other violation
of the section under which he was charged.

out for ratification and approved by all the members

voting in the same way at the various ports by hand vote.

in his lawsuit.
Q

Cole, was not himself a union officer or agent?

He was a rank and file member?
MR. HALL:

He was a rank and file member? that is

right.
Q

And employed as a seaman?

MR. HALL:

That is right.

In the course of this suit, about 1965-7, he
suffered aboard ship a back injury, and that is why he is
now retired.

He was not able to work anymore.

It has taken him more than nine years to bring—this
caf.e was brought in December of 1963.

It has run through a

25
long serie;:; of obstructive—-opposition tactics? shall we say.
Mr. Sehuliiian is in error when he says that it was removed
from the calendar because of a failure to observe local
court rules.

It was removed from the trial calendar on

motion of defendant, because defendant a year after the
calendar, it had been down for trial, desired to serve
interrogatories.
The actual putting it down for trial was delayed
at defendant's request because they had said that they
wanted to serve interrogatories.

No interrogatories were

served, and it was put down for trial I think the day before
a calendar order would have gone into effect dismissing the
case.

A year later the defendant came forward with his 195

interrogatories.

After those were disposed of, the

defendant depositions of the plaintiff, and from there on it
went to trial.

It has been, of course, to the court of

appeals twice, once on the preliminary injunction

and,

second, on this instance here.
Q

Would you raise your voice a little?

MR. HALLs

Oh, I am sorry.

Getting on to the real meat of the question, which
is the nature of the power of a court in equity to award
attorneys * fees where the doing of -justice requires, I would
■suggest that this case is on all fours with Mills v„. Electric
Auto Lite Company.

In fact, it Would be almost possible to

r- v...:ike out:

word "corporation" and put in the word

"union” and have the identical case before us.
In Mills certain minority stockholders brought
suit, as Your Honors know, to challenge a merger.

This

Court*s decision did not decide the merger question, but it
was found by the district court, and this Court agreed, that
there was a violation of the duty of the corporation officers
to send out ncn-misleading information.

The benefit,

conferred, in other words, on the corporation and its
members by the Mills case was a non-property benefit.
was a non-monetary benefit.

It

Xt was the benefit of fair and

democratic proceedings within the corporation, just as the
benefit which Mr. Cole has contributed to this union and to
its members is the guarantee of democratic rights on the part
of those union members.
Q

What was the source of the cause of action in

the Mills case?
MR. HALL:

I believe it was a suit to challenge a.

merger on the ground that the—
Q

Equity action or of statute—

MR. HALL:

Xt arose under the Security Exchange

Act under -a guarantee of non-mis leading statement* to be
sent out in 'shareholders' votes.
Q

It was not part of a structured statutory

scheme, or was it, that provided for stockholder suits and

27
stockholder claims and remedies?
MR. HALL:

The statute did provide for a suit in

other sections and it provided specifically for attorneys'
fees in other sections.
I believe in the section under which it was
brought, I believe Section 14, it does not specifically say
that suit can be brought, I believe.
Q

Was that not one of the reasons the Court

used to distinguish

Mills from Fleischmann where they have

held that attorneys' fees were not permissible, was that in
Fleischmann the statute had provided a private remedy,
whereas in Mills the Court had to imply the private
remedy and therefore it was free to also imply attendant
attributes as a remedy?

28

The second distinction, the one that Your Honor
is referring to. is the fact that in Lanham Act, Section 35,
the suit under which Pleisehmann was brought, there is an
;..nd intricate statutory scheme for relief,

tremely

The statute specifies that profits may be obtained in
addition to demagesf in addition to costs.

It spells out

:he various ways in which profits are to be determined or,
if the district court does not find the actual profits
adequate, will find new ones.
The statute has prescribed in elaborate detail
in the Lanham Act what the man may get if he brings suit.
Hare there is no such spelling out.

There is simply the

provision by the statute that you can bring a suit for such
relief as may be appropriate.

That is to say, it is the

equivalent of saying you could bring suit.

Obviously, the

court gives such relief as it deems appropriate.
It would be impossible, I think, for Congress ever
to specify--to give no general language, to indicate a more
general intent as to the nature of the relief given than it
has in Section 102 of the Landrum-Griffin Act.
Q

Unless you take Mills where it did not specify

any private right at all—I mean, this is really somewhere
between Mills and Fleischmann.

It is somewhere in that sense.

that, for instance, an action done in violation of the
requirement about non-misleading information would be void
and. presumably would be actionable to make it void.

But l

will have to retreat because I do not have the statutory
language in front of me.
Q

Do you have any comment about Section 501(b)!s

specific provisions?
MR. HALL;

501(b) is a suit involving fiduciary—■

section involving the—well, 501(a) imposes a fiduciary duty
on officials.

And 501(b) is a suit to obtain for the

benefit of the union relief for breach of the fiduciary duty.
It does not give, to my mind, general equitable powers to the
court.

What is more, the nature of the suit contemplated

in 501(b) is such that there would be no fee award in the
flense of award payable by the defendant as such.

Rather,

501(b) talks about.division of the monies recovered for the
benefit of the union.

I believe the operative language is,

“The district court may allocate a portion of the recovery

30

for counsel feas,K
The district court's power--and 1 would suggest
it does have the power in a 501(b) suit*—to award counsel
fees in addition would not come out of that clause, as I
understand it, but would come out of the fact that perhaps
the amount recovered was not sufficient and it was necessary
to give a counsel fee award.
There is another distinction between the sections—
I did net mean to jump into it in the middle this way—that
the two sections which specify attorneys * fees awards in the
Landrum-Griffin Act are the only sections which specifically
say that suit could be brought in state as well as in
federal court.

The power of a court in equity to award

counsel fees has been essentially a federal matter.
states are various in their views on that question.

The
And it

is, I believe, possible, that the Congress may have had in
mind a desire to make clear to all the state jurisdictions
that counsel fees are properly awardable under the two
sections.

One is 201(c), whiqh relates fco accounting assets

and so on, and the other is the 501(b) that we have been
talking about.
The history of the act indicates very clearly that
many people in Congress—and certainly the ultimate drafters
of the act—felt 'very strongly that, counsel fees should be
awardable in a case of this kind,

Senator Goldwater was

31
timely outspoken on the question, as Mr. Schulman has
on •••.'tented.

He apparently at first thought that the

Senate

hill or that Title I as it came out of the' Senate did not
provide adequate guarantee that there would be counsel fees,
hr.d so he voted against the bill.

He was the only senator

who did.

He v,5on it in that initial time it came up in the

Senate.

And so he urged some other kind of provision in the

House bill.
The House had before it not the Senate bill
directly but the Elliott Bill.

And the Elliott Bill was

somewhat different in its language.

I have quoted the

operative language on page 31 of my brief.

I would suggest

that although, as Congressman Elliott indicates, he intended
very general relief by that provision, that in the style in
which it is written it would suggest a somewhat flabbier
approach to the powers of the court it comes before.
That at least was the opinion of the nine
*•

Republican members of the House Committee.

Those nine

members—and they included Congressman Griffin—submitted a
sat of dissenting views or a minority report to the House
report on the Elliott Bill,

They started it by saying, "We,

the undersigned members of the committes, are convinced beyond
doubt that HR 3342"—that is the Elliott Bill—"in its
present form is grossly inadequate as a means of dealing with
corruption and racketeering in the labor management field."

32
Domi further in their dissenting views it becomes

lamination, of adequate enforcement prov.i. sionsi

That is

their first reason given for saying that the Elliott Bill
is inadequate.
Then they come around specifically—and they talk
about counsel fees.

They say.. "One of the most serious

inadequacies"-—now, they refer to the Senate bill for reasons
which 1 would suggest are simply a terminological error
here—"is the. lack of any effective enforcement procedure
to protect union members from those few union officials
ho fail to recognise that a union belongs to its members t"
and so on.

And they emphasise that there must be counsel

fees awardable.
Then at the end of their dissenting views they say
very clearly that because of thasa inadequacies, we—us nine
people--we are going to oppose this bill and we intend to
support the Land ruru-Cr i f £ in Bill when it comes up on the
House floor.
Griffin Bill.

Now, in fact, they did support the LandrumIn fact, one of those was Mr. Griffin.

tha Landnxm-Griffin Bill replaced the Elliott Bill.

Ane­
That is,

it “replaced the text, the entire text of the Elliott Bill
after the enacting clause was deleted and the text of the
Laudrum-Griffjn Bill put in.

33

I would submit that at the very least those
statements by Mr» Griffin and by the other eight minority
people indicate that when they pushed for the LandrumGriffin Bill, they were pushing for language which they
believed would be adequate, which would guarantee counsel
fees to union members, which would be - adequate, in other
words, to meet the problem of corruption and racketeering
in the union.
Whether or not the Elliott Rill really was
inadequate, of course, is a dispute between them and
Mr. Elliott,.

Mr. Elliott believed that it gave wide relief—-

the language that he had drawn up—gave wide latitude to grant
relief according to the necessities of the case.

They

disagreed and so they opposed Mr. Elliott's bill and they
put in their own.

And their own .is virtually identical

except for a few additions, like the parenthetical phrase
"including injunctions," with the act as presently adopted.
1 would suggest that as far as Senator Go3,dwater
is concerned, Senator Goldwatar on reflection must have
concluded that the language of the Senate bill—because the
language of the Senate bill was identical to the language
of the Landrum-Griffin Bill was after all sufficient, that
its generality did give courts power to grant equitable
relief, inc3.ud.ing attorneys' fees.
Nothing, at least, more was said on the matter

34
it

before the Senate again,

• ; though

My recollection is,

cannot cay it with definite certainty;, that

te vire:,' GoMwater ultimately voted for it.

2 think if you

: t'-' to •-•e: ;:h-:ih2t as my friand would, that these Congressmen
r:.v,2 Senators lid not intend their final bill to give
attorn&ys; fees, then you would have to conclude that they
deliberately pushed a bill which they believed to be
inadequate, which would not meet the needs that were called
for to combat corruption and racketeering.
I would suggest that that implies a kind of
Machiavellianism that should not be assumed and they should
not be accused of unless there is something more to suggest
it.

I think-—-and I think one must draw from the overall

history—that these Congressmen and Senators wanted attorneys*
fees to be available; they said so.

They felt that any bill

which felled to make them available would be woefully
inadequate,

And so they chose language which, on reflection

and study, was sufficient to make an attorneys' fee
awardable under ordinary equitable principles.
Thank you.

Yes, just a few comments, if I may,

35
Number one , 1 would just like to direct a few

therewith.

I think iha trial court’s findings will determine

dec

ssue I would like to point out specifically

to this Court is that as this Court has so often admonished
'*nd advised us and told us, that labor legislation is a
compromise of extreme views *

And the question of getting

legislation passed is a distillation of the compromise.

And

X think that is most reflected in the additional statement
by the Honorable Philip M. Landrum and Honorable Robert P.
Griffin talking about the principal differences between the
Elliott Bill and their bill.

And they say in paragraph one,

"Title 1 of the substitute, the Bill of Rights for union
members, is essentially the Bill of Rights in S 1555 as it
passed the Senate.

Those who have tried to put a union

busting label on our Bill of Rights"—he is talking about
the Landrusn-Griffin—"would pin the same label on 90 members
of the other body," manifesting to me so clearly that what the
bill was in the Senate and which Senator Goldwater went
be ores them, the House committee, to tell them what the
language meant, could not command a majority to bring forth
any language: to provide for, expressly as required by the
oonricar law, for the authority to grant counsel fees.
