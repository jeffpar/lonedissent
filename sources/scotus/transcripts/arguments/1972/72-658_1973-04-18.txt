ME. CHIEF JUSTICE

Mr. paltea, yr,vi reev

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LeROY L. DALTCB, 3SQ.

ON- BEHALF OF. TSB Al?PELLRBfS
MR. DALTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Courtz

This is an appeal fr-tn a three™-judge district
court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.

This cacc

involves the liquor licenses of three bars in the City ofRacine and six bars in the City of Kenosha.
Kenosha is a city of about 70,000 on the border
of Wisconsin and Illinois, jest north of Chicago.

Racine

is a city of about 90,000# 95,00.0, just a few raiic.B north
of Kenosha.
This appeal is from a judgment holding that the
Wisconsin statutes which permit legislative hearings in
liquor license renewals' and original grantings are in
violation of the due process clause.
The court, said that insofar as those statutes?
t the denial of a.

licenses, without a judicial type hearing, the et&tntae
vie lat© the Fourth.mth Ara-sncftsant.
Tha judgment its so broad against these two cities
that when the licensing ye«x , rhieh is approaching arrives.

these cities are enjoined £rc:a denying any renewals,
h motion is'. pending before the- .three-judge court tc modify
that but.is unacted upon.
1. would.like to take the Court back through.our
liquor licensing regulations in Wisconsin,

Wa he.v« chat

may be compared to the old town meeting type of legislation.
Since the Twenty~Pirst AnerKlneat? wo ps-icmit what wo caul
local option»

That means that each of the carer 7,000 local

municipalities in Wisconsin has the authority to grant or
not to grant licenses for the sale of beer or ilntanicafinc
liquor or both.

This is a legislative grant to. fchesu

municipalities, and at the present time about 15G
municlpalities do not permit the total package.
are

There

that permit beer, and there are some that permit

beer—of course,' the majority permit beer and liquor—but
there fire some that permit neither.
These cities, towns, and villages. sure the ultimate
authority in our state to determine whether or not beer and
intoxicating liquor will be served within their borders.
Q

The option is exercised by the voters?

.MR, ‘DALTON:

body.

MR. DALTON;

Yes.

We just want through one of

And. before they

anybody could go into a state court for certiorari, they
went into the federal court* and the federal court enjoined
the town from revoking.

During this period of time, the aggrieved

asg of course, can avail themselves of one

proceedings in the state.
Ho liquor license can foe issued . .
unless the applicant has first obtained a bear Irceiiee»
The beer license, if it is denied, if the application is
denied, can be reviewed by a procedure in any
record in the county.

This is an original action brought

by the applicant to test the revocation or denial of a
license in the county court or circuit court.

Q

Is that a review do hove or a trial da novo?

MR. DALTOHs
Q

i* trial de novo.

Hot just a review an any record?

MR. S*M#TOHs

Ho, it is a trial de novo.

And

there are limits set by the Wisconsin Statute as bo
the court, must act: so that any aggrieved parties can have
a prompt determination of the issues.
The other type of court review is by certiorari,
l-vcVc-:-

sprees court has without sny question set cut the
res that are to be followed in that type of

9
proceeding.
Q

That is discretionary with writ or is that—

MR. DALTON;

The writ of certiorari is

discretionary♦
Q

And in what court does that ifjo?

MR, DALTON:

That is in the circuit court.

That

is the court of general jurisdiction in tho estate.
There is another feature of Wisconsin law—
Q

That is a review, is it not?

That is not a

de novo.
MR. DALTON:

That is a review, including all

constitutional questions—*
Q

There is no record, is there?

MR. DALTON:

Yes, the notes that are made go to

. court, review.
Q

There is no transcript.

MR. DALTON:

There is no transcript of

testimony, no verbatim transcript.

But if there is a

denial, of course the statute requires & statement of the
reasons for denial be made in the record.

And all of the

notes of the licensing body in the case of a city council
that are subsequently printed, part of the record in this
case, would go to the circuit court for review.

MR, DALTON:

If you are talking about the (vo.OSi,

Apparently no one has ever really

In that connection, Mr, Dalton„ i tm looking

You keep saying statement of reasons.

You

know what stipulation of facts—is that statement of

Statement of reasons, as I understood you, was

a piece of paper that the council wrote up as statement.of
.reasons for denying John Jones renewal of his license.

Am

X correct there is no such instrument?
MR. DALTON;

Other than the report of the

committee.
G

Then there is no such instrument as a

statement of reasons?
MR. DALTONs
Q

Oh.

They adopted the committee report.

Then when you say statement of reasons.

23
you mean the committee report?
MR. DALTON:

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Under the law the committee itself 'could have

acted without reference tto the council, as I read the
statute, and that is one of the complaints of your brothers
on the other side.

They did not even know which body was

coins to act, whether it was going to be the committee or
the council as a whole.
MR. DALTON:

The council as a whole has to make

the final determination.
Q

That is not what the law seems to say.

It

says all town or village boards and common councils or the
duly authorized committees of such councils, and so on.
MR. DALTON:

In these cases they were all

referred to the city council.

Q

They were in fact in these cases—

MR. DALTON:

They were in fact.referred to the

city council, and they adopted the reports of the
committee.
The committee reports are in fact the basis for
the legislative actions

The reasons why the legislative

body decided that they would resolve not to have nude
dancing within their municipalities.
It is true that this record does not specifica1Xy
set out that resolution.

And I think that that is not a

24
federal constitutional question.

That is a question of

state law as to whether or not the city councils in these
cases actually followed tha state law when they adopted the
resolution that they would not license nude
their community.
To give von a little bit more background vn that
happened, the two cities when faced during the 1970 1 icens-e
year with-nude dancing in several bars' and after receiving
over 2,090 petitions in the City of Kenosha erf. reward
25,0(50 in the City of Racine, the councils in both cities
passed ordinances which regulated costumes in cabarets.
This required the dancers to cover the sexual organs.
Both cities were enjoined by the federal district
court in December of 1970.

From that point until the next

licensing year in 1971, the cities, both these cities, were
faced with a dilerana of how to control nude dancing in the
bars in those cities.

The test of obscenity was difficult.

The county prosecutor prosecutes the criminal laws—

Yes.

dancing to take place in these two cities.

MRa WALRATH $

Our position is, Your Honor, that

thay could not, ar«d that was the next point 1 wanted to
raise.

The procedures which 'must be followed"--now, I have

epecifia raxarancs , first of all, to whon a liquor lioenae.

not renewed"-

Q

Is your colleague essentially correct with

respect to the beef license?
MR. WMiRATH:

X would submit than he is not,

because a—
9

Well, you take it your own way then*

MR. WALBATHs

Okay.

First of all, 'four Honor,

as far as the liquor licenses are concerned, oh: vc. ■■ liquor
license application is not renewed, the exclusive remedy,
as I understand it under Wisconsin law, is by certiorari.
Q

Xn which event no evidentiary hearing? all

on records, reasons and notes?
MR. WALR&TH:

Yes, all on handwritten notes or

typed notes by city clerks, whatever is there.

In the

present situation there was very little of any sort of
record as far as what statements were mads at the hearing.
Q

That is not our question here, whether it wes

arbitrary or not,
if,- WAX»*? ATH?
mant to a trial de novo.

But there definitely is no entitle"

29
Q

After certiora?!, the judge coylfi not cjive a

hearing? ■
MR, • W&LRATHs

That is correct„

On certiorari t the

only thing that the reviewingacourt can do is look at the
return’which is.filed with it by the municipality.

That

return would, in. most instances» merely 'contain the notes.from the clerk of the municipality, which would state underas required by state statute--the reasons why~Q

A statement of reasons?

MR. MMRATH:•

It would contain a statement of

reasons, yes.
Q

Would it specifically be what appears at

page 44 to 46?

Would that ba a sample of a return?

So, this is not a return.
MR. WALRATH:
Q

That, is right.

Is this what a return would look like?

MR. W&LRMTid

31 would submit 'that the return could

include that documentf yes, if this document was in fact
adopted by the city'council as its reasons for denying the
license.
Q

And, in addition, then there would foe what,

notes, you said?
MR. WALRATHs

Possible notes, if they had been

taken.
Q

But if the city council gives no 'reason at

30

ail. is it automatically arbitrary to deny renewal?
MR. WALRATH:
Q

There must be a reason for denying renewal?

MR. WALRATH:
Q

1 would submit yes, under state law.

Yes, by state statute.

So, arbitrariness of denying renewal simply

turns on whether it states a reason or not?
MR. WALRATH:
than that.

Our claim here, Your Honor., is more

We are claiming that the procedures were

arbitrary because prior to the council's taking the action
that they did, they did not grant each of the appellees a
hearing—
Q

1 understand that.

MR. WALRATH:

That is the other aspect of

arbitrariness that we refer to.
Q

But I would suppose there would be a

different case if you had a right to a complete de novo
hearing on review of the renewal where you could call
witnesses, and the state would have to call its.
MR. WALRATH:
Q

Yes, no question about it.

Then you would not be here, would you?

Or

you would not have brought the action—
MR. WALRATH:
Q

You would have gone in state court.

MR. WALRATH:
Q

We would have gone to state court.

Yes.

And let me understand this clearly now.

You

31
say that

or

the liquor license renewal the .only route open

to you in the way of "judicial review is certiorari or the
record below?
MR. WALRATHs

yes.

That is correct.

What is the connection of
the' liquor license?

.. . to

1 thought Mr. Dalton told ns you never

get to a liquor license question until you have been granted
a bear license.
MR. WALRATH:

You cannot have t liquor licc-rea

unless you have a beer license first.
Q

What about these appellees?

MR. WA&R1TH %

In each instance X da not believe

there is an indication in the record as to whether in ea<
instance their beer licenses were denied.

T, would have to

rely on the representations of the state in that regard
that they were.
Q

And if they were, as I understand it, you

might have gone into one of the county courts or the circuit
court and got a de novo hearing?
MR. WALRATH s
Your Honor.

That is the argument•of the state,

But I would submit that that does not comport

with a reading of the state statute which provides for
procedures on beet licenses.
Q

Section 66.054, sub 14—

What page?

MR. waLR&TH:

?we 4 of .the brief of the appellants.

32

That prevision starting at the very bottom of ptga
4 Key?, to ©si 3 that the action of toy city counci?, .in granting
ot tea ravceafi©© of any license or the faictDi© os s&id
city council to revoke sty license for good cause may be
reviewed by any. court of record.
q

■

Does not .granting cover renewal?

Granting,

does that cover renewal or not?
MR. W&LKATH:

Our point, Your Honor, is that there

is no express declaration in this

statute to cover the

situation where renewal is denied, that ”8 are nor. ass a

revocation situation? we .arc in a denial or renem.*,
situation, which is not covered by this statute.

■

Q

Oh, 1 see.

Q

What you say basically is that 66.054 is

X see»

more devoted to the outraged citizen who feels the.& a license
has been improperly granted or has not been revoked wnen
it should he's1'
MR. WhLRATH:

Yes.

Or to the outraged tavern,

keeper who has gone through revocation procedures which

are separate from what .this case involves.
Q

The provision that your colleague referred

to an a de novo hearing on denial of a beer license

renewal

that provision was not considered by the three-judge coiar'c,

S understand.
m. mbmmt

That is correct.

It did not consider that as a matter of

Q

Wisconsin law or in connection with its due process'ruling?
MR. WALRaTH:

If my recollection of the lower

court opinion is correct, it did not consider that remedy
as a viable one for these individuals.
Q

Well, it did not even consider it.

MR. WALRATH:

I am not sure what the opinion on

that point states, Your Honor.
Let us <

s for the moment

these gentlemen had. his beer license renewal refused and
could have gone to court and had a de novo hearing as to
whether the reasons alleged existed or not,
that were true.

Let nr assume

Would you be here or not?

MR. WALRATH;

Then 'the question would be, If they

did get a remedy in state court and they did get a beer
license, then the next problem is that they still did not
get their

liquor licenses back and-—
Q

The liquor licenses depended on the existence

of some reasons.

And if it has been determined that those

reasons did not exist—
MR. WALRATHs

Then I would say as a matter of good

faith they would have to provide them with the liquor license
yes.
Q

That is right.

MR. WALRATHs

But there is nothing in the

34
statutory procedure which would compel them to do that.
Q

1 was just curious to know whether the

district court addressed itself to this matter at all.
MR. WALRATHj

Not in the -way that- we have jut.

gone through it.
Q

Mr. Walrath, I appreciate you have hardly

had a chance to get the first sentence out of the arguments
you intended to make.
again.

So, 1' apologize for interrupting you

But I have a basic question here/ which is this.

The Due Process Clause, of course, covers deprivations of
life, liberty, or property and those alone.

And obviously

life is not involved here, and I wondered how you defined
what, if any, liberty and/or property is involved.
MR. WALRATHs

Your Honor, if 1 may, the situation

is this, that the—first of all, we submit that both liberty
and property interests under the definition of or the
analysis provided in Board of Regents v. Roth, both of those
concepts of liberty and property were involved in the
situation.

Both the liberty of these tavern keepers and

the property of these tavern keepers was impaired by the
decisions not to renew their liquor licenses.
Q

These were one-year licenses--

MR. WALRATK;
Q

Yes.

—under their terms and under state law.

That is what they were and that is all they could -be.

35
MR. WALRATIIs
Q

Yes,

Is that not correct?

So, that is very much

like-~
MR, WALP.ATH;
Q

It is similar to Roth.

—like Mr, Roth's teaching contract, is it

not?
MR. WALRATH:

But there are soma very significant

differences from the Roth.situation.
Q

That is what 1 am interested in»

MR. WALRATH:

The first significant, difference is

that in Roth the action taken with regard to Roth was not—*
the reasons for not renewing Roth's teaching contract were
never stated, were not required to he stated, and were never
made public.
In other words, one of the significant factors in
the Roth case, I would submit, is that Roth was never faced
with a situation where the reasons for his non-renewing his
contract were communicated to anyone.

And if those reasons

had been, one, reasons which alleged dishonesty on his part
or immorality in his affairs and they had been' communicatee.!
to the public, this Court said that his case quits clearly
would have been si different one.

And I would submit, Your

Honor, that the situation is very analogous in our own case
in that by statute—
Q

The court indicated he would then have been

36
given an opportunity to clear his name if the charges ware
false.
MR.

WAX, RATH:

That is correct»

Q

1 did apt understand there • • '

that this kind of dancing did not go on in these bars.
MR, WALRATU;

No, but that is not ch-;-. central point

m

.cipalities did not say that they wer
renewal of these licenses because of nude dancing.

They

said--now, 1 want to be very specific, first of all, and
refer to the appropriate parts of the record.

First

of

all, the municipality of Racine, you will note on pages 35
and 36 of the appendix, there are the reasons which the
municipality of Racine or at least the license committee
gave for recommending that their licenses not be renewed.
Those statements make no reference whatsoever to nude
dancing.

They do attribute to the tavern keepers conduct or

operations which foster an increase in prostitution, in
venereal disease.

They also attribute as reason {f)—-they

attribute instances of serving minors on the premises.

They

attribute matters of fights- or altercations in violence on
idle premises.

None of these reasons are correctly related

or in any way stated by the municipalities to involve nude
dancing.
As far as the municipality of Kenosha is concerned,
the statement of reasons in that situation with regard to the

3?
six Kenosha tavern keepers s:\ay be found, on page V of our reci
covered brief-

And, again, there is no clear—nowhere in

this record is there simply an assertion by these munici­
palities that they are not renewing these licenses merely
because they do not like nts.de dancing.
Q

on page 69.

I am perplexed about this criminal complaint
How did that get in the record?

MR. WALMTK:

On page 69 of the appendix, Your

Honor?
Q

Yes, sir.

KtO

tp Y* .Y .

:

.'-.t

'

p:

following page, both of those documents were inserted into
the record below as part of the affidavits on motions for
summary judgment.

Both of these complaints, 1 would stress,

relate to matters which occurred long after or after any or
these license renewal denials occurred.

In-other words, the

facts that are stated in those complaints are not—-and the
filing of those complaints—are not relevant to the reasons—
Q

How did they get in there?

X still do not

understand how they got in there.
MR, WALRATH:

I think they were inserted as part

of the documents that accompany the motion for summary
judgment .by the state.
Q
mide dancing.

Then we do have something in this record about

38
MR. WALRATH:

There is definitely something 'in this

record, yes.
Q

This is the record in this esse.

MR. WALRATH:

The question is whether there was

anything in the record before the licensing committee and
the city council and whether they said specifically or only
that the only reason they were denying these licenses is
because of nude dancing.
Q

You do not know whether this was before the

city council or not.
MR. WALRATHs
Q

I am sorry, 1 did not'hear.

Do you know whether these complaints ware

before the city council or not?
MR. WALRATH:

They could not have bean. Your Honor,

because they were—
Q

Did you object to them being put in the

record?
MR. WALRATH:
Q ■

No, I did not.

What?

MR. WALRATH:

I did not.

I just think they are

irrelevant.
They are irrelevant on the question of nude
dancing?
MR. WALRATH:

No, they were irrelevant on the

question of what was before the licensing committee and the

city

ici 1 st the time it reached its decision.
One other point that cams up on direct argument#

the statement of reasons why the Kenosha municipality, why
it denied the liquor licenses, those reasons that you find
on page 7 of our brief were adopted at a city council meeting
word for word*

Xn other words, the license committee entered

these findings and 'then made these findings a recommendation
to the city council.

The city council adopted them word

for word with regard to each of the sise applicants *

In other words# word for word there were no
variations in the finding of fact*

The same activities were

ascribed to each of the applicants in a rather indiscriminant,
broad fashion.
Q

Is that not the nature of the legislative

licensing process sometimes?

You take a category of people

and say they are not going to be in or they will be in.

MR. WALR1TH:

Yes# Your Honor# I would submit that

in a legislative type situation where you are—as in the
LaRue instance, where you were dealing with legislative
findings in enacting a resolution or an ordinance or a state
statute, these kinds of statements are appropriate.

But

here we were dealing with a definite adjudicatory situation
where the. city council or the licensing committee itself was
passing on—-as required by statute—-was passing on the
question of whether these individuals were proper

40
individuals to have their licenses renewed.
In

.

&

.cl

So, 1 think we

squires

specific findings of fact»
Q

Do you contend that in any way there was a

commonlaw kind of a property right or expectancy to a tenetal
each year?
MR. WALR&TH:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is an

argument we did not make sufficiently, 1 would submit, in
our brief.

That is the Perry y. C.tnderman rationale that—-

I, would submit there was—-there is clear evidence that there
la an implied property interest in or claim to having your
liquor license renewed from year to year.
First of all, 1 think it is implied by the very
fact that the state statutes require that licenses can only
be renewed if reasons--or not renewed, excuse me, can only
be denied if there are reasons given by the municipality.
Secondly, the record also indicates that there
were some 154 to 139, I believe, applications to renew
licenses before the municipality, and in only six situations,
the six appellees in this case, were those applications
denied.

So, there is more or less, 1 would submit, a

commonlaw situation or an implied situation that licenses
will be renewed unless cause is shown by the municipality.
Q
all?

The district court did not rely on that at

41
MR. WALFJVPH 5
Q

No, it did not.

So, the district court rathe r relied on the

court of app-oals opinion in the Roth ease, which was
subsequently reversed here.
MR. WALRP-'TH:
Q

Yes.

Correct?

Mr. WALR&TH:

The three-judge court below did net

have the benefit of Perry v. Clnderman or Roth-—
Q

It had the then benefit of—you had the than

benefit of a case that was subsequently reversed, the Roth
opinion in the court of appeals.
MR. WALR&TH:

Yes.

But we think quite clearly,

even in light of Roth, which does restrict concepts or at
least define concepts of liberty and property more
carefully, that quite clearly these individuals, their
liberty and property interests, were affected.
Going back to the definition of liberty, under the
Roth decision, I would submit it should also be borne
mind that because these individuals and the accusations
against them consisted of allegations of criminal type
conduct, immoral influence on minors and juveniles in the
community, quite clearly this brings this case within the
language of Roth that these are the types of allegations
which affect a person's liberty.
And, more importantly, these are the types of

42
rh. : i' :

-v

license holders»

■: ■ ' :■

'.'4 v..

,

4 . ':to

And, by state statute, once again the

critical eligibility factor for getting a license is that
you must be a person of good moral character»
1 would submit that the allegations therefore,
in effect, make these license holders ineligible for renewal
or ineligible to hold a license anywhere else in the state
of Wisconsin, because they have been branded as persons of
bad or poor moral character.

So, that is the other aspect

©f liberty which we -submit has been affected.
Just because these tavern keepers, who run
legitimate businesses as tavern keepers choose to have
burlesque-type entertainment or topless or nude dancing on
their premises does not necessarily imply that they in any
way have permitted prostitution on their premises or that
they have permitted minors oh the premises and have imposed
immoral influences on juveniles.

And these ware the

allegations that were leveled against them and these are the
allegations which, under Roth, they should have a right to
answer and counter.
I hope the record is sufficiently clear on—
Q

On the 'fact that this is true or on the

question of whether this is a legitimate reason for non­
renewal?
MS. WALR&TH:

I am sorry.

1 did no't hear the

<13
beginning of your question, Your Honor.
Q

You. say they are entitled to a hearing to

determine the fact of whether these events took place or
whether this is an adequate ground for non-renewal or both?
MR. WMiRATHs

The former f not the latter«

They

are entitled to a hearing to dispute or challenge these
allegations.

If the al' sgationa of prostitution hr immoral

influence on youths had been established afe the hearing.,
then 1 think quite clearly it is, under state statute, within
the power of the municipalities to deny their application.
Q

Mr. Walrath, as you probably know in Monroe v.

Pape this Court said that Section 13G3 did not apply to
municipal corporations.
for

What is .the federal statutory basis

joining the City of Racine and the City of Kenosha in

this action?
MR. WALRATH;

They were joined beckuse the lover

court was able to distinguish the Monroe v. Pape language in
that that was,, if 1 recall correctly, a damage—*s. request
for damage.s.
Q

Here is what this Court said in Monroe

Pape»

"For we are of the opinion that Congress did not undertake
to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of 1983.”
MR. WALRATH:

But if 1 am correct, Your Honor, 1

believe that was in the context of a damage suit against the
bity .: Cb:.' ■:.'

, 3■

i v; ■

44
Q

1 think that is correct.

I would not read that

language as being addressed particularly to damage suits.
MR. WhlsRM'H:
Q

It is our position that it can be—

How do you distinguish?

MR. WALRATH:

There are two cases out of the

Seventh Circuit, Your Honor, that distinguish—
Q

Hot as a matter of Seventh Circuit precedent

but as a matter of reason.
MR. WALR&TH:

Frankly, I am not familiar enough with

the history of 1983 to be able to distinguish it at this
time.
Q

You do not need the reasons if you have the

law on your side in the Seventh Circuit, do you?
MR. WALR&TH:

That is what we had.

We had two

eases-Q

Good.

Q

When you responded previously to the question I

put- to you, I era not sure which case you ware referring to.
Turning to paragraph Ho. 26 on page 32 of the appendix, in the
stipulation of facts they have stipulated the fact—the parties
have stipulated a fact which, under the rule, would mean non­
renewal of the license.
MR. W&LRATH:

Do you—
I do not dispute that, except for

the fact that the municipalities in this case did not say
that they ware denying the applications of that fact in

45
paragraph 26.
In paragraph 32, a page later,, they say that
the method of doing business includes that paragraph 26
reason.

How do you. get away from that?
MR, WALRATE:

The statement at paragraph 32 is

something that happened in federal court, and it is a
statement that was not made at the time that the licenses
were renewed or denied, excuse me, that the renewal
applications were denied.
Q

What was the purpose cf paragraph 26

stipulation of it was not to bear on the decision to renew
or not renew the license?
MR. WALRATH:

I think the purpose of paragraph 26

was merely to get an agreed stipulation of fact that in fact
we do not dispute the fact that nude dancing occurred on
these premises.

That is not a disputed fact.

What is

disputed is whether there was prostitution on the premises—
Q

No, but do you dispute that that is a good

enough reason not to renew the license?

Do you challenge

that after LaRue?
MR, WALRATH:

At the time, yes, it was a disputed

fact because—
Q

At that time.

MR. WALEATH:
Q

Yes.

But since that, time this Court decided the

46
LaRua case„
MR. WALRATHs

That is correct»

After the LaRue case,

ragraph 26 the

end of the case in terms of whatever cases are covered, by
that stipulation?
MR. WALRATH:

Whether or not the municipality has

subsequently been proven to be right or wrong as to the
basis for denying the applications, it still does not counter
the problem that these individuals and the procedures that
confronted them denied thorn due process initially.
Q

What do you do with the top of page 34, that

this is the reason for the denial?
MR. WALRATH:
Q

At the top of page 34?

First full sentence.

"That the defendant

City relied on such dance entertainment as one of the factors
producing the effects enumerated in paragraphs (a) through
(f) of said Resolution in denying of the license...."
MR. WALR&TH:

It relied but it did hot specify—

first of all, it did not give any notice prior to going into
any of these meetings or hearings, it did not give notice
that that was what the charge was going to be.
G

But that is not what I am talking about.

This

admits that the reason that, they denied it was because of
nude dancing.
MR. WALR&TH'?

Kb, I would, beg to differ with you,

47
Your Honor.
Q

What, really is said if it doss not say that?

MR. WAL8&TH:

It says that the defendant city

relied on such entertainment as one of the factors producing
the effects.
Q

That is right.

MR. WALRATH:

What they specifically stated

as the

reason for denying the license applications was net the
dance entertainment; it was the allegations of paragraphs
la) through (f).
Q

But this is all in the same

statement hare.

It is all a part of the same thing.
MR. WALRATH:

What you are reading from is again

the stipulation of facts—
Q

That were in the federal district court.

MR. WALRATH: —in the federal district court.
Q

And 34 and 35 is the findings of the committee

adopted by the common council

and

one of the municipalities.

And on page 7 of your rad brief are the findings of the.
committee adopted by the common council of the other
municipality„
MR. WALRATH:
Q

That is correct.

• And they are quite separate from the

stipulations in the district court.

I

MR. WALRATH:

Am 1 right in thinking that the stipulations

in the district court were not necessarily entered into by
all the parties?

You are just representing a fraction, X

take it, of the parties that were actually in the district
court.
MR. WALRATH:

That is also correct.

However, the

stipulations were entered in every case, which is noted on
the cover.
Q

Oh, so there is no distinction then between

what might affect your clients and people who have not—
MR. WALRATH:

There is no crucial variation in the

facts as far as what was stipulated to.
Q

X£ this case goes back, all the city has to

do is show that there is nude dancing there and that is
against their policy and that is the end of the case, right?
MR. WALRATH:
Q .

So long as they can show—

Q

So long as you have a hearing.

MR. WALRATH:
Q

So long as we have a hearing.

This is purely a due process claim.

MR. WALRATHs
in LffiRue.

Yes.

We are not challenging what happened

We. are just saying before you can deny us the

right to continue our taverns, you have to give us a requisite
hearing so that allegations beyond nude dancing, should they
arise and should they be the basis for denying the licenses,

49
can be countered if they are in fact not true.
Q

There was no due process issue in La-Rue , was

there?
MR. WALRATH:
Q

Not that I am aware of, Your Honor•

In your view of the due process question, if

the case went back to the district court, would the
stipulation paragraph No. 26 be sufficient if they put
and only that in evidence as the reason for non-renewal?
If the city council gave notice, went through all of it:;;
processes, and then put this stipulation in evidence, would
paragraph 26 be sufficient then* in your view, for the dehia
of the renewal?
MR, WALRATH:

If that is the only allegation that

the city raises, 2 think that would be an adequate basis for
a non-renewal.

Under LaRuo the city admittedly does have an

ordinance on the books which defines what type of

dress is

required on tavern premises.
I should add, however, that the city ordinance is
not identical to the La Rue statute and in fact if .is our
position that the city ordinance is even broader and more
restrictive than the LaRue statute.

So that that would be

an additional issue that might be raised at a hearing before
the city council.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.
