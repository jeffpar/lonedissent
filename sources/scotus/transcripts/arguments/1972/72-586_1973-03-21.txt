CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

nrst this morning in Ho. 72-586, Cady against Dombrowski.
Mr. Dalton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LE ROY L. DALTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DALTON:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an action in habeas corpus in which the
court or appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted Dombrowski,
the respondent, a writ from his imprisonment in Wisconsin
for murder unless the state elects to retry Dombrowski.
Dombrowski was convicted of murder in 1968 in Fond du Lac
County, Wisconsin.
Appeal was taken to the Wisconsin Supreme Court,
which affirmed.

Then a collateral attack was made on that

judgment in the district court in Milwaukee.
was denied.

Habeas corpus

The case went to the Seventh Circuit.

On September 9, 1967, Mr. Dombrowski, who was an
off-duty Chicago policeman, drove his 1960 Dodge automobile
to his brother’s farm near Kewaskum, Wisconsin.

That

evening the car became disabled and the following afternoon
-te had it tewed to his brother’s farm.

He left it there and

returned to Chicago with his brother that day.
it 11:30 a,m. the following morning—that is

September 11th-—he rented a 1967 red Thtmderbird at the
• ;' i: re Airport in Chicago.

At 10s30 that night, still the

I1th, he was involved in an accident near Kewaskma,
Wisconsin.
He called the sheriff’s

department and two

officers picked him up from the village
went to the scene of the accident.

of Kewaskum and

He informed them that

he was a Chicago police officer.

They found tbs car off the highway and they called
tor a wrecker, and Officer Boudry did a cursory inspection
of the interior of the vehicle to see if his service
revolver was there.

It was not.

•lie vehicle was towed to the garage at Kewaskum
where it was parked outside of the garage, and bombrowski
was taken to the sheriff’s office in West Bend.

He was

later charged with drunk driving, became incoherent, was at
the hospital being checked by a doctor, unable to
communicate with the doctor.
An

Officer Weiss, the other officer, who had been

on the sheriff’s department for five and a half months,
decided that in view of the fact that this man was a
Chicago police officer, he very likely had that gun somewhere
in his vehicle and he should go back and look for it.
■ e

So,

b:ove back to the unattended vehicle, opened up the

front

door., looked in the front end, and found a book of

5

rules of the Chicago Police Department,
Obviously feeling then that he was on the right
track# because if the man carries his rule book he probably
has his other paraphernalia of

his police officer status *

he opehed the trunk still looking for the gun.

But he

found bloody material# including officer's pants# a night
stick covered with blood# and a tarp, a floor fcarp# from a
Dodge automobile saturated with blood.
G

The automobile at this time was at a repair

shop, was it?
MR. DALTON %

It was outside of a filling station

garage in this small town.
Q

It had been towed there?

MR. DALTONs

It had been towed there and left there

Outside of the garage by the officers.

The officers called

the tow operator# and he brought the vehicle there.
Q

It had been locked?

MR. DALTON:
Q

Yes# it had been locked.

. And this Officer Weiss# where did he get the

key to open it?
MR. DALTON:
Q

From Officer Boudry.

It had been taken from Dombrowski when he was

taken to the hospital?
MR. DALTON:
Q

Yes.

Had Dombrowski authorized them to take the car

6
to this place?
HR. DALTON:

He was present at the time and made

no objection.
Q

Why was it taken there at all, just because it

wsc someplace to go for safekeeping or what?
MR. DALTON:

It is something that happens all the

time in our society now.

We are a mobile society and we get

in trouble with automobiles.

In this case it was disabled.

It cannot stay on the highway.

It has to go somewhere.

And

the officers had him in custody? so, they have to take that
vehicle—■
Q

So, this was the official arrangement for the

custody of the car?
MR. DALTON:
Q

Yes.

With the station?

MR. DALTON:

This was a standard procedure

apparently in this part of the county where the sheriff's
office called this wrecker operator and had him tow these
cars, disabled cars, to his place until they were properly
taken care of corns way or other.
Q

Was it in the custody of the police?

MR. DALTON:

I think so, yes.

I think it was their

rosponjj.ibility, especially at that hour of the night.
Q

Could they not have secured the car?

■ MR. -DALTON:

Pardon?

7
Q

Could, they not have secured the car without

searching it?
MR. DALTON;
Q

My question was could.

MR. DALTON:
Q

1 do not think that was—

They could have—

Why not?

MR. DALTON;

I suppose they could have taken the

car right to West Bend to their police station.

I would

imagine they could have.
Q

Or they could have put it inside the garage.

MR. DALTON:

This was a filling Station type

operation where there is not room inside the-—
Q

I gather that with Officer Weiss's purpose

he would still have searcheds even if it had been housed in
a garage, would he not?
MR. DALTON:
Q

I assume—

He was looking for the service revolver, was

he?
MR. DALTON;

I think he was concerned—and this

of course is not .in the record because the officer was not
cross-examined during any one of the five different
proceedings

to establish anything other than his intention

1:;; preserve that gun for that fellow officer that was under
arrest.
"hen was Dombrowski first arrested?

Whan ha was brought to the sheriffs

That is when they announced that they were charging

him with drunk driving.
Q

That is before he went to the hospital.

MR. DALTON:

Technically I suppose he was under the

custody of the officers from the time they took him and took
his car to the filling station garage.

But he was not

charged with a specific offense until they had talked to the
district attorney.

And then he was charged with drunk

driving.
When the officer observed these bloody materials,
he picked them out of the trunk.

They were still wet.

the tarp especially was saturated with blood.

And

He took these

materials back to the sheriff's office and then when
Doxnbrowski was able to communicate, they confronted him, and
he asked.to talk to &n attorney.
The attorney was brought in, conferred with
DombroWski, and later the attorney went to the district
attorney, who is in the same area, and advised the district
attorney that if they searched the Dorrthrcwski farm, they
would find a body.
Sc. the officers, accompanied by one of the
atv.ornoyc, er>. associate of the attorney who had relayed the

message* went to the farm and—

Yes.

He wanted to talk to an attorney.

And

So, a local lawyer was provided to him?

MR. DALTON:

A local lawyer talked to him and later

came out and advised—
Q

This is in the hospital?

MR. DALTON:

Right, in the hospital.

And he

advised the county district attorney for Washington County,
where West Bend is located, that there would be a body on the
Dombrowski farm which is just across the county line in
Fond du Lac County.
Q

Is Kewaskum in Washington County or Fond du

Lac County?
MR. DALTON:

In Washington Comity.

The village is.,

ut the fern, the Dombrowski farm, is in Fond du Lac County.

10

Q

Was trv'c «•. little «--outh?

3ALT0N;
south of Fond du Lac.

N: rth of - Kewaskut:
Fond du Lae is at the foot of the

lake, as the name indicates, and about a third of the way
between Oshkosh and Milwaukee, generally speaking.

Justice

*

Rehnquist knows that.
This is? the area where Mr. Dombrowski grew up.

When the party arrived at the farm, they realised
that they were in Fond du Lac County.

So, they contacted

the Fond du Lac County authorities as well.
In the afternoon of that day, the dead body of

Herbert McKinney was found on a dump on the family farm near
c picnic area, which was north of the buildings and the

spot where the Dodge vehicle had been parked the day before.
Q

And who was the

victim?

Was he a member of

the family?
MR. DALTON;
no motive.

The victim was from Chicago.

We have

We were able to prove only that they frequented

the earns pool hall in Chicago.
Q

Is the inference reasonable that the body

was in the trunk of. the ear and carried out to the farm or—
MR. DALTON;

2 think, reconstructing the crime,

that he brought McKinney from Chicago in the Thunderhird
because he had rented the car in the middle of the night,
a ear matching that description .Was seen by the Dodge

;-round four o’clock to seven o’clock in the
nnrninn.

The pathologist established the time of death as

around seven a.itu
The nnside of the Dodge automobile was saturated
with bloodo

Ons of the socks, which is alleged to be a

contaminated piece of evidence, was in the Dodge.

'The other

sock was out by the body near the dump.
X would think the reconstruction would go like this.
He took McKinney possibly when he was unconscious out of the
Thunder-bird, into the back seat of the Dodge, killed him
there, shot him, and the pathologist established—and we
were able bo 'establish—venue, which is a necessary element
in first degree murder in Wisconsin by the pathologist's
testimony that he, in his opinion, bled to death in the
Dodge automobile.

He took the body out of the Dodge

automobile, put it in the trunk of the Thunderbird, carried
it a few hundred yards over to the dump area, pulled the
body out of the trunk, dumped him.
Then at IDs30 that morning, he was seen buying two

answering the description of the towels was among the material
retrieved from the Thu.riderbird.
r .u- the toby was found, one of the investigating

off

, the

under sheriff for Fond du Lac County, walked

ov.v ■ /ware the farm buildings and he saw this Dodge

12
automobile with an Illinois licens® plate.

He looked in the

Dodge and he saw it was saturated with blood in the back
seat» running over the front of it» I think he described.
Thai

blood on a briefcase» there was blood all over the

back seat area» the various upholstery and so on had Mood.
It did not take an awful lot of putting1 together
to corse to the conclusion that possibly this dead body had
been in that car» because there was hardly any blood left in
that body.

It was laying on the dump with the head down» and

the body was white.

The pathologist testified later on that

this body had pumped practically all of the blood out in an
attempt to save the life of the individual.

Whenever the

body is injured in a vital area» such as the brain or the
heart, the rest of the body works and creates terrific
pressure to send blood to that emergency area.

And so you

can imagine that blood was spurting out of this wound every
time his heart beat.

It did that until there was no more

blood to send.
So,they asked for a search warrant.

But the Dodge

We are now talking about the Dodge?

MR. DALTON:
that was on the farm.

Yes, we are talking about the Dodge
And so the search warrant was

issued at 8:15 that evening.
Wisconsin.

This is September in

And, as the record indicates, it was getting

dunk when the crime laboratory people arrived from Madison
at 7:20.

So, you can bet your bottom dollar that at 8:15 it

was getting pretty dark.
The search warrant was issued.

The

undersheriff

:.hers Went to the scan© of the crime and got a

14
x'iv tract to haul the vehicle into Fond, du Lac and the
sheriff's garage.
The Seventh Circuit I think made a serious error
finding that the

undersheriff had executed the search

warrant at the farm when he went out and looked into the
rouge.

There was testimony that he opened the door and

looked in.

1 think they questioned him on a motion after the

verdict as to whether or not he had searched the vehicle,
and he said yes.
No materials were taken out of that vehicle at
the farm,

and all we have to do is look at the trial record

and find out who identified all of these items.

In a murder

case where you have got a lot of people handling the various
items of evidence, you have to have a chain of evidence.
The? chain of evidence firmly establishes that Mr. Hauer
from the crime laboratory was the first man to take anything
out of that Dodge, and that was done while the Dodge was
impounded in the sheriff's garage in Fond du Lac.
There is a direct quote in the circuit court of
appeals' decision that the undersheriff seised the tarp and
the sock in the Dodge that evening.

That is not true.

It

cannot be supported by any interpretation of this record.
In fact, the record is so clear that everything
was taken cut of that Dodge at the time of the search on the
"aciug Of the iSth.

15
Q

By whom?

MR. DALTON:
Q

Who did that searching?
Mr. Mauer front the crime laboratory.

This is not the deputy.

MR. DALTONs

This is the—

Mr. Matter is an' expert who--we have

a crime laboratory system in our department of justice,
they go out and help local law enforcement people on
specialized, things.

The sheriff called.

counties are not experts.

Sheriffs in small

As we all know from ail these

search and seizure cases# we are putting too much of a burden
on them.

But when Mr. Mauer was called# he was told there

was a search warrant.

And so# since the vehicle was

impounded, they waited until the next morning and conducted
the thorough search.

Because? what was the purpose of a

search in that vehicle?

It was to obtain all of the

physical evidence of the crime that was available.

And only

an expert who knew what to take out of the vehicle could
decide that at that time.
Q

Mr. Dalton, I am confused about one thing,

is it clear that the Seventh Circuit had the entire state
record before it?
MR. DALTON:

Tea, Your Honor.

When I was

preparing the appendix, I contacted the clerk's office in
Milwaukee, and for some reason or other there was no entry
made in the docket to show that after a stipulation had been
•entered, the record would not go to Chicago,

It did, and

16
that latter was later on sent to the court and the clerk has
"•.t now.

So, I apologize for any misleading; it was

unintentional and I thought 1 had checked everything out.
1 went there personally to see what the record consisted
tf, and. it was later on when Mr. Mulligan was preparing his
brief that these records were found, part of them in the
Seventh Circuit in the clerk’s office and part of them in
Milwaukee.

But they are here now; all the records are here.
Q

What was before the Seventh Circuit?

MR. DALTON2
record

The Seventh Circuit asked for the

to be sent down there several months after the rest

of the record want there.
Q

Was it there when this case was decided?

MR. DALTON;
Q

Yes.

How do we know?

You said you did not know;

you had to go check- it.
MR. DALTON:

Subsequently the clerk in Milwaukee

found a transmittal letter.

It was not in this file.

Apparently it was misfiled.

And the letter was sent to this

Court after, the record came down.

It 'was added to the

record here.
Q

Added to the record hare.

But, I mean, was i

added to the record in the court of appeals?
MR. DALTON:

Yes.

The court of appeals, I am

i:C.tis£iedf had the full record.

17
Q

You are satisfied?

MR. DALTON2
Q

Yes.

One other question, Mr. Dalton.

1' take it

that all of the items taken from the Dodge were taken within
the 48 hours of the issuance of the warrant?
MR. DALTON:
made on the 14th.

Yes.

The return on the warrant was

That is another fact that the Seventh

Circuit determined that is not supported by the record.

They

said that the warrant was executed and a return prepared
and therefore the warrant was functus officio.
What kind of games are we playing?

We cannot even

take a vehicle that has been impounded and search it for
evidence of murder without—
Q

I understood that the decision of the Seventh

Circuit turned not on any search.

I know they did a lot of

talking about the search of the Dodge.

I thought what

really happened here was that they reversed on the search
of the Ford.
MR. DALTON:
Q

On both of them, Your Honor.

You think it is on both?

MR. DALTON:

Yes.

If I may just a moment, the

search by Officer Weiss„ if we want to call it a search,
every court has picked up a new name.

And we try to stay

away from the word "search," because we really do not know
what a search is.

It was done by Officer Weiss with the

18
intention of securing eioms property of Mr. Dombrowski.

Q

At that time, the only crime, if any, was the

is that right?
MR. DALTONs

That is right, Your Honor.

X think on that point that nowadays police officers
are not just law enforcement people.

We have millions of

vehicles on the highway every day and everywhere where you
and I drive our vehicles, we might force a local law
enforcement official to either arrest us for violating the
law, to come to our aid if we have an accident, to come to
our aid if we have a heart attack; in any of a number of
circumstances a law enforcement officer may he called upon to
help someone who is in a vehicle away from his home.

he did not want it floating around in that car.

And the

we think that this act of

God# of sending that rooky police officer to look after this

man who has been convicted fairly of first degree murder.

Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. MULLIGAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MULLIGAN;

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it

please the Courts
We have before us two searches, a search of a Ford
I'hunderbird and a search of a Dodge.
;

q

In connection with the

:ch of the Ford Thunderblrd# I think it is imperative to
.ider soma of the additional facts surrounding the

20

circumstances of the various searches that were conducted of
that automobile„
As counsel indicated, on September 11, 1967, at
10:30 at night, that car was involved in a one-car accident=
Mr. Dombrowski, an off-duty Chicago police officer, summoned
the sheriffrs deputies to the accident, to come with him to
the accident scene.

He communicated with those officers

during that time period.
accident.

He assisted them in locating the

He told him what his occupation was, told them

that there ware no other

persons involved in the accident,

that he was alone at the scene.

He told them three different

versions of how the accident occurred.

He furnished them

his license and identification.
The officers investigated that accident and called
the record.

Prior to the removal, Officer JBoudry searched

through the entire interior of the car.

He searched under

the seat, in the glove compartment, and in the back seat of
that car.

"
Q

Mr;

Mulligan, when you said he gave them

three different versions, were they inconsistent versions
of the accident?
MR. MULLIGAN:

In some details I think you would

have to consider them to be inconsistent.

Basically I think

you could characterise them as inconsistent, yes.
Q

At that time your friend indicated that

21
:ow:v'ki was suffering from oirer-i-idulg©nce in alcohol
ana perhaps from shock from the accident.

Do you agree-with

that?

MR. MULLIGANt

I think the record indicates,

Mr,. Chief Justice, that Dombrowski had .been drinking.
it was not until for the first time at the

But

West Bend police

station that the record indicates that he became in any way
incommunicative.

And it was not until at two o'clock the

following morning when he was in the West Bend Hospital that
he-was unable to speak at all; and at no prior time at the
accident scene or at the West- Bend sheriff's department or
at the police department did the officers who searched the
car for the gun even ask Mr. Dombrowski whether he was
required to have a gun and whether he in fact had such a
gun or where it might be located.
Q

Do you accept the version that what they were

doing they were doing as a favor for a fellow officer
anyway?

That is the reason they were searching for the gun?
MR. MULLIGAN;

Officer Weiss testified that he

was searching for the officer’s service revolver.

I do not

think the motivation is clear whether this was a search for
some beneficial purpose or whether it was investigatory in
nature.-

I think the record could foe interpreted either way

with respect to that.

It is not clear from- the record.

police custody.

The car was

It was not in

No representative of the sheriff’s office

remained with the vehicle.
It is not olear from the record where the keys to
the automobile were.
Q

The tow truck. I suppose, belonged to the

service station to which the car was taken?
MR. MULLIGAN:
Q

Yes* Mr. Justice.

This was a small town.

Did the police or the

sheriff’s office have facilities to impound automobiles and
to assign a man to guard it?
MU. MULLIGAN:

I think that it is clear from the

record that had the sheriff's department desired to impound
the car and keep it in safekeeping* this Thunderbird, they
would have dona what they did later on.

They would have

towed the car to the sheriff’s garage™Q

With the Dodge, what they did later on with

the Dodge?
MR. MULLIGAN:

Yes.

And X think that indicates

that they did have the facilities, had they desired to do
so, to safekeep’it.

And subsequently with respect to one

of these vehicles they parked it at a county garage while it
was being held to the trial.
G

There was no reason, of course, to impound the

23
cl • >. unci arb'ird.

There was no, at that time, ground;:: to

- tapeot murder or anything els©

arid a few moments ago,

except, as the Chief Justice

just that Bosibrowski had bean drunk

and had a wreck.
Mil. MULLIGAN:

That is correct.

There wau no

probable cause for any reason to seise the vehicle at that
time.
Q

The Thundarbird activity of the place was

carried on by Washington County police, was it not?
MR. MULLIGAN:
Q

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

And the ultimate impoundment of the Dodge was

carried on by Fond du Lac County police?
Mil. MULLIGAN:
Q

Yes, that is correct.

Is it not conceivable that the Washington

County sheriff might have one modus operandi and the Fond du
Lac County sheriff have, another?
MR. MULLIGAN;

It is possible that -there could be

separate methods of operation.

However, it is indicated in

the record that when Sheriff Howard went to execute the
si-arch warrant, one was issued on September 12th for the
Dodge, and a search warrant was issued on September 12th for
the; Thunderbird„
..-.•..•ute th:

And he, when he went to search for the—

search warrant for the Thundarbird, went to the

; ifff s grurag© at West Bend to execute it.

So, it is only

:.lcal to presume that in the interim that that vehicle,

24
■ ft- :: the goods, bloody articles were- located f was taken to
sheriff’s garage at West Bend, Wisconsin and impounded
there.
Q

1 am not sure just what point or whether you

had a point in mind in comparing the casual way the first
car, the Ford, involved in the accident was taken to the
filling station as compared with the
with respect to the Bodge.

more careful steps

Would you agree that it might

be reasonable to take very casual steps with respect to just
a damaged car with no criminal acts involved except
drunken driving and much more precise and careful steps when
there appeared to be a homicide involved?
MR. MULLIGAN;

Yes, I think there is a logical

basis for treating them differently, and I think what is
indicated here by the difference in the way these cars were
handled is that in the one case, with respect to the
Thunderbird, that it was never considered to be in police
custody.

It was merely taken to the private garage and

left there in a locked condition, as opposed to the way you
would handle something that was in your custody where you
are maintaining a chain of control over the article.
Q

That automobile involved in the accident would

be an important item of evidence

even in a drunk driving

charge, would it not* to show the extent of the damage as it
', ■ ■. !■. bear v ,;c - the quality of the driving just as an

25
evidentiaary matter?
MR* MULLIGAN:

I doubt that such evidence would

normally be offered in a drunk driving case»

The fact the

car has been in an accident really is not indicative of the
.nature of the driving that took place prior to it.

And I

think there would be some question as to whether it would be
material or .relevant if it had been seized as evidence of
that crime.

But there is no indication in the record, here

that it war. seised.
Q

Mr. Dombrowski ran into some immovable

object, did he not?
MR. MULLIGAN:
Q

He did not hit another car.

MR. MULLIGAN:
Q

Yes.

No.

Bo yon suggest that the condition of the car

would not be an evidentiary, a relevant, piece of evidence
in establishing the drunk driving charge?
MR. MULLIGAN:
whether it would be.

I think there is some question

I think the officers testifying as to

the location of the car being off the highway and it had left
the highway, is probably as indicative of drunk driving as
the particular extent of damage that may have occurred, to the
vehicle itself.
The officers that left the accident scene at 11:33
. night want to the West Bend sheriff’s office.

At the

26

West Bend sheriff's office, Mr. nombrcwski conferred with an
.r

^intent district attorney there.

It was not until 11:53

-•hat evening that he was arrested for drunk driving.
taken to the West Bend Police Department.

'He was

There he was

•ed an opportunity to take a breatholizer test but
refused that test.
He was then taken to the West Bend Hospital to-

be treated for injuries that he had sustained in the
accident.

At the hospital he talked by telephone to the

doctor, and it was not until the doctor came to the hospital
at 2:00 o'clock that there was any indication that
Dombrowski was uncommunicative.

Q

Does the record show what was the matter with

him at that time?

That is quite a period of time.

Was he

still drinking cr what was it?
MR. MULLIGAN:

He had presumably been still

drinking until the officers met him at the Glacier Inn in
Kewaskum some time after 10:30 that evening.

He was

described in the hospital as having blood upon him, the
possibility of nose bleeding.

And at one point his legs

began shaking and his head went, back, I believe is the way
it was described in the record by the doctor when he
testified.

And at this point he was not able to express

himself,

The doctor.. with the officers, called Dombrowski8s

27
e is; Chicago to see if there were soma other explanation
:c.- ;.;o

whnt his condition could be other than perhaps drinking

£ivd a nosebleed from the accident.
'hiring that conversation, the police officers did
not take the opportunity to inquire of Mrs. Dombrowski as to
what she might have known with respect to the officer's
revolver, whether he had it with him or where it might be
located.
Q

Who made that call, the doctor or the police?

MR» MULLIGAN:

The police officers together with

the doctor made that call.
Q

Are you suggesting that the doctor wanted to

find out whether he suffered perhaps from epilepsy or a heart
condition or something of that kind?
Mil. MULLIGAN:

I think that is indicated in the

record, that he was seeking to see if there was some other
medical reason for the man's condition, at that time;
After this, Dombrowski remained in the hospital
under guard at all times thereafter.

At 2:13 that morning,

approximately four hours after the time of the accident and
about two and a half hours, two and a quarter hours, from
Mr. Dombrowski*s arrest, the Officer Weiss went back from
Wo t Bend ho Kawaskum, Wisconsin to the private garage,
eked the- car, and again searched the interior of the
\cle.

Be had to unlock the trunk tc look into the trunk

28
as he searched for Dombrowski’s gun.
Q

Does the record show that he originally

searched the car for the gun?

When they first went out

there, did they not search the whole car for the gun?
MR. MULLIGANs

Yes, the record indicates that

initially Officer Boudry searched the entire interior part
of the automobile.

He went in the glove compartment, under

the seat, in the back seat, of the vehicle before he locked
it and had it towed away.
Q

Was he searching for the gun?

MR. MULLIGAN:
Q

Yes.

Or just searching for anything?

MR. MULLIGAN:

I believe that the record at that

point is that he was searching.

Weiss described the search

as a search for the service revolver.

It is not even clear

from the record whether at the accident scene or at any time
prior to that that

Bornbroxtfski himself was searched to see if

he had the weapon on his parson.

And that was noted by the

Wisconsin Supreme Court when they considered this matter.
Q

That would not be very difficult to observe

when they took him into the station and down to the hospital,
in that period of time they certainly would just by
casual observation have known whether he had a typical
service revolver on him, would they not?
MR. MULLIGAN:

Mr. Dombrowski was off duty at the

29
cine, was not in uniform.

Perhaps at the hospital, if he was

changed into hospital attire, it might have been possible to
note that , but I ara not so sure that a service revolver could
ba detected on an off-duty police officer wearing civilian
clothes and concealing it upon his person.
There never was any consent by Dombrowski to search
the Thunderbird.

There does not appear, when it comes to the

time of the second search of that automobile,, to have been
anything additional that had come to the police attention
that would have given them probable cause to search the
vehicle at 2s13 that morning.
The county court of—
Q

Would it be unreasonable for police to assume

in this day and age that an unattended car sitting in a
filling station lot overnight might be broken into, both
trunk and the body of the car, by either vandals or
youngsters or somebody bent on theft?
MR. MULLIGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I do not think

that is a reasonable conclusion to reach in a world
community in Wisconsin in the nature of Kewaskum, Wisconsin,
that it became any more a target of a break-in that perhaps
Dombrowski's home in Chicago where he may well have kept the
service revolver.

And I do not think the fact that he was

in Wisconsin would have given them a right to have his home
in Chicago searched as a possibility.

30

Q

2 am not talking about the right.

•talking about the practical aspect.

I am

Are you suggesting that

titions are so safe in that part of Wisconsin that no one
over has his car broken into at night if it is left out
unattended?
MR. MULLIGAN;

I am not sure that it has never

occurred, bat I think—
Q

That is not as often as Chicago?

MR. MULLIGAN;

Yes, I would agree.

It is less

likely that any risk to the vehicle in a town of the nature
of Kewaskum, Wisconsin than there is in Chicago or New York
or any larger city.

And here we are dealing with a vehicle

that had already been searched in the interior and there
was nothing indicative of anything that would be a target.
Q

But the trunk had not been searched?

MR. MULLIGAN:

The trunk had not been searched

but was locked and presumably is not the typo of thing that
you could easily get into without a key.
The county court of Pond du Lac County upheld the
se rch of the Thunderbird in part on the basis that it was a
search incident to -the arrest for drunk driving.

We think

that it, is clear from the application of the Preston case
thc:t such a search that Was conducted at a different time
and place could not be upheld as incident to the arrest.
Q

Mr. Mulligan, the revolvar never was found, the

MR. MULLIGAN t

It never was found.

When the trunk

was searched—
Q

What was found was that bloody material in the

trunk of the Thunderbird?
MR. MULLIGAN:

Q

That is correct.

And that was introduced in evidence over

objection# was it?
MR. MULLIGAN:

Yes. Pre-trial motions were made to

suppress, and a voir dire examination was held at trial in
which the motions to suppress were renewed.
Q

Was any alleged murder weapon ever found or

introduced in evidence?

MR. MULLIGAN:

No, no such weapon was ever

produced.
Q

The victim was shot, was he not?

MR. MULLIGAN:
beaten with some object.
even, suggested

The victim was shot and apparently
During the closing arguments it was

that the defendant could have produced the

gun, his own service revolver.

Ballistics examinations had

indicated that the bullet had been rifled with six lines and
grooves to the left, and that evidence was offered that a Celt
revolver, such as registered to the defendant, had such
rifling.

Q

How did his lawyer know where the body was?

MR. MOLLIGoMs

Presumably Mr. Dombrowski

communicated with Attorney Schloemer in the hospital room and
cold him information that a body could be found in. the picnic
area of his brother's farm and that a writ of prohibition
had been sought through the Wisconsin Supreme-Court to
obibit ' -.is disclosure of attorney-cl lent privileged
information# but that court interpreted that there had been
:\i: intentional—a desire that, this information be communicated
to other sorts.

But the mere statement that there was a body

on that farm is not a confession that this man is a person

it could be, but there

MR. DALTON;

Thank you, Your Honor.

The reasonableness of suspecting that someone way

brought up.

And the allegation by counsel is that in a

small town you do not have those worries.

X know a lot of

'•51a.ll town district attorneys who would like to have some
proof of that when they are prosecuting people for breaking
open trunks and taking spare tires and wheels and especially
when they sea a car disabled from out of state.
Now naive are we?

here to there to everywhere t and small towns are no-Q
