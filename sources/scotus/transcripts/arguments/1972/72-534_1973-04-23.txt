RANDOLPH;

Mr« Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
-This is an appeal from the judgment of the three-

judge federal district court in the District-of Columbia#
noidxng Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act unconstitutional

for food stamps to related households.

The court enjoined

households contriving one or more unrelated individuals.

This is not an accurate description of the

First of all, for purposes of Section. 3(e)

,

the

statute specifically provides that if unrelated persons

Second, if there are children under the age of

And it*a

st:?.ranted in th-a appendix to our reply brief,
The Knowles decision holds that even if people
«nsvni«i—MMiriwmi

dire it fcfet saute house or apartment and share housing
•:d-:perisea, they are not necessarily one household for
purposes of eligibility*

Because under the acts- in order

is hw considered a household, the group of persons must
wporate as an economic unit; that is, common living
•".rpsnses must be shared from the income of all.

The needs

b’ all members have to be provided without regard to
willingness or ability to pay.
For example, if two unrelated families move in
together and short; only housing expenses * they could be
wo'nsidsred two related households instead of one unrelated
-.ou3ehold.

Perhaps Mrs. Keppler might serve as an example,

•ter situation is reported on pages 26 to 27 of the appendix,
huc sit- illithat she moved in with another woman in

t:y

v :• iwg expenses.

There is no indication that

it r owooraX pooling or sharing of all resources with‘ t ; ‘.b

■willingness to contribute or pay.

10
In our brief we drew the analogy that just simply

because two lawyers, for example# share an office does not
...oo-.i that they are necessarily partners# even if they both
'ohare the expenses for that.

X think there are numerous

other examples of this.
Q

The Keppler will not fly if they had pooled

all their resources?

m.

RANDOLPH:

Sorry?

The Keppler case you just mentioned# if those

two ladies pooled all of their economic resources—
MR. RANDOLPHi

They would be ineligible because

then—Q

They would still be ineligible.

MR. RANDOLPH:

They would ba then one economic

unit and therefore not two separate households living
together but one household and therefor® unrelated.
Q

Would they b® eligible?

MR. RANDOLPH:
Q

So# what la the difference?

MR. RANDOLPH:
Q

No.

The difference is—

1 mean# what is the difference between the

fact that they did not pool their resources—if they pooled
them# they still would foe ineligible..

But if they did: not po*l their

resources; they would ba eligible.

Why not hypothesize without the hippies?

Would you not be making more progress?
MR. POLLACK:

Yes, Your Honor.

It seems to me that

it is very clear that it is the persons who are not voluntary
poor, it is the persons who are not hippies, they are the
ones who are harmed by this provision, and they are harmed
irrationally, merely because they live with someone else to
whom they are unrelated.

No, I am not saying that at all, Your

I see no correlation at, all with any of the purposes

that were hypothesised by the Government in this case with
this provision,

There is just no correlation at all.

There

It is very simple for them

to alter their living arrangements.

All they have to do is

live aa different economic units.
Take as an example a group of 20 people living in

MR. POLLACK:

Your Honor, I Would suggest to you that this

This

program would not be easier to detect fraud through this
provision? quite the contrary.

What is going to happen is

■-hat the voluntary poor, who are going to fractionate their
households. are going to multiply the applications that are
necessary to get. them into the program.
In other words, take the hypothetical I gave before.
X.i there is a group of voluntary poor people, 20 people, and
if they want to stay in the food stamp program, all they have
to do is separate their households into 20 different groups,
instead of making the program easier to administer, quite the
contrary, it will make it harder to administer.

MR. POLLACK;

They could have one kitchen.

MR. POLLACK:

If they had even one kitchen, as long

as they lived as 20 separate economic units—
Q

What is your separate economic unit?

MR. POLLACKs

In other words, they do not purchase

food in common; they do not pay their utilities in common—

that.
