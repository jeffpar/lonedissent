MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Wo. 70-69, United States against Orito.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is in some ways like the one just arqued,
and in some ways different.

It is a prosecution under section

1462 of Title 18 of the United States Code, which would have
been applicable in the prior case, because it makes it a crime
to bring into the United States obscene material, but it is
also applicable to any person who knowingly uses any express
company

or other common carrier for carriage in interstate or

foreign commerce of any obscene, lewd, lascivious, and so on,
book or other material.
This case started with an indictment, which appears
on page 1 of the Appendix, involving a charge that a substantial
amount, 68 reels of 8 mm color films, two 16 mm negatives,
three 16 mm black and white films, and a number of other
items were caused to be transported, and carried in interstate
commerce from San Francisco to Milwaukee by Trans-World
Airlines and North Central Airlines.
There was then a motion to dismiss, and that motion

4
appears on page 3„

This case has been thought to involve the

same question as the previous case, namely, whether that
statute can constitutionally apply to a private transportation,
But I would like to suggest to the Court that that
question is not really here, and that the question which is
here is one which was decided by six or seven members of the
Court in 37 Photographs.
For the motion to dismiss, on page 3, "Comes now the
defendant in the above-entitled action ... respectfully moves
this Court for the entry of an order dismissing this indictment
on the grounds that Section 1462 of Title Ifi is unconstitutional"
and then skipping a few lines, "defendant respectfully asserts
that regardless of whether the transportation is for the
purpose of commercial distribution or for the personal
possession and enjoyment of the transporter, this statute
violates rights guaranteed by the First and the Ninth
Amendments.”
And then at the bottom of page 3, six lines from the
bottom, having dealt previously with the private transporta­
tion:

"On the other hand, should this statute be construed to

s.

impose criminal sanctions only upon those who utilise inter­
state commerce for the purpose of the commercial distribution
of obscene material, then this statute denies to the
defendant the right to sell and distribute obscene material
which is predicated upon the correlative right of an

intended recipient to purchase and enjoy this material."
Thus it seems to me cruite clear that this case
involves exactly the same questions as those in 37 Photographs,
two questions:

First,, is the statute unconstitutional because

it might apply to private importation?

And the Court, in

37 Photographs, held that the statute should not be so
construed, and that even though it might be invalid as applied
to private importation in that case, that it would be valid
as applied to commercial importation.
The result of the decision below is to deprive the
United States of its opportunity to prove that this was a
commercial transportation and not a private transportation.
If it was a commercial transportation, United States v. 37
Photographs is clear authority for the constitutional validity
of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, then, you're suggesting, Mr.

Solicitor General, that we could not hold private use, in the
preceding case, protected without making the situation vou've
just described?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, the question

which we argued in the last case is there.
that I can say about that.
question isn't here.

I have little more

All I'm saying is that that

That question is not presented by this

record.
QUESTION:

This district judge struck down the

6

statute on its face, did he not?
MR. GRISWOLD:

This judge cut down the statute on

its face, held that it was unconstitutional entirely, and I
think that is demonstrably wrong, because I think the Court
has decided that it is constitutional, as applied to a
commercial transportation in 37 Photographs, and I think that
the Court has decided that, even though it might be
unconstitutional as applied to a private transportation, that
is not a sufficient basis foi" holding the entire statute
unconstitutional on its face.
And in this connection I would point out two other
decisions.

The very district judge below who decided this

case has subsequently decided, in effect, that his decision
was wrong.

Since this Court decided 37 Photographs, he has

sustained a prosecution under this statute in United States
v. Zacher, 332 Red Supp 883.
Now, there was confusion at the earlier argument,
where my associate, Mr. Greenawald, said 833, and the case
couldn't be found: but it exists.

It is 332 Fed Supp 883.

And also, at the same time that the case was coming
through the Wisconsin court, there was another case in which
the same defendant, George Joseph Orito, was convicted under
the same statute in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California.

That conviction was

affirmed, it being a commercial dissemination, and this Court

7
denied certiorari in 402 US 987, almost contemporaneously
with the decisions in Reidel and 37 Photographs.
And so, this is my argument in this case, that the
question involved in the previous case, 200 Reels of Film, is
not in this case, is not properly before the Court, and that
the only questions which are in this case have already been
squarely decided by a clear majority of the Court in 37
Photographs.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same
day. 3

R

AFTERNOON SESSION
f 1:0 0 p. m. ]
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Solicitor General.

Mr. Chief Justice, as I have already

indicated, I do not think that the Question of private use of
pornographic or obscene materials is involved in this case,
and I would rather hesitate to hazard that, shall we say,
ultimate issue on this particular case.
I would like to observe, however, that even at
best this is not a very private situation.

The indictment

here charges the shipping of a substantial quantity of
material by air express, not personal luggage, not
accompanying the traveler, but the transportation over a
distance of some 2,000 miles within the United States.
If that is personal, then the underlying foundation
of Stanley, which I take it to be thought control — and I
dislike thought control — but it can be a kind of a shibboleth
which serves to stifle further thought.

If that is private,

then Stanley, it seems to me, has little or no limitation.
And in that connection I would like to refer to
another case, which was once before this Court, this is B. & H„
Distributing Corporation, United States v, B. & H. Distributing
Corporation, which was where an indictment was dismissed by
the United States District Court for the Western District of
Wisconsin, Judge Doyle in that case, Judge Gordon here.

The United States took an appeal, and this Court,
on June 21, 1971, in 403 US 927, vacated the judgment and
remanded it for consideration, for reconsideration in the light
of this Court's decisions in United States v. Reidel and United
States v. 37 Photographs.
Now, in Judge Doyle's first opinion in that case,
he drew the distinction between private and public, he didn't
make it between private and commercial.
private and public, and he said:

But he drew it between

If the terms are employed,

then public uses or conduct mpst be defined as those which are
in conflict with the goal or interest of protecting children
from exposure to obscenity, or with the goal or interest of
preventing assaults on the sensibilities of an unwilling
adult public.

Private uses or conduct must be defined as

those which are not so in conflict.
Now, that, you see, extends the private conception
to everything except children and non-consenting adults; that
seems to me to have no proper foundation in the concern
about thought control which underlies Stanley.
I would point out that the decision that commercial
distribution may be made criminal has a thought control
element, because if the material is more difficult to obtain
through commercial distribution, it becomes harder for these
ideas, such as they are, to be communicated and thought about
by individuals.

10

Now, this B. & H. case went back to'the Western
District of Wisconsin.

The Court has again dismissed the

indictment, relying on Stanley v. Georgia, and I have authorized
the taking of a further appeal to this Court, not only
because of the issue but because I feel a considerable
obligation to lay before this Court any decision in which a
court holds an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional.
It seems to me that if an Act of Congress is
unconstitutional, it ought to be by decision of this Court,
with full respect, of course, to the lower courts which must
develop the cases for presentation here.
But —
QUESTION:

I take it, Nr. Solicitor General, that

that case does present the
MR. GRISWOLD:

defect

aspect of it?

In this sense, Mr. Justice, that —

QUESTION: The same sense as this case?
MR.GRISWOLD:

No.

In the sense that it is private

unless it involves children or non-consenting adults, which
I think sometimes is put under the head of pandering.
QUESTION:

No, really what I was trying to get at

was whether that case, like this, has the defect that you see
in this one, of this one really involving commercial.
MR. GRISWOLD: That I cannot —
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. GRISWOLD:

— tell you, Mr. Justice.

We do not

11
concede in that case that it was private,
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD;

What I am using the case to

illustrate is that if you draw that line between private and
commercial, item 1, it is a far from clear line, item 2, like
so many ideas which have a tendency to expand, the private
motion is already expanding in lower court decisions, and
would apparently take over everything except pandering.
Now, I look at the —
QUESTION; Before you proceed, Mr. Solicitor General,
looking just at the face of the indictment in the Appendix
in the present case, is it clear to you — it certainly isn't
to me, offhand — that this involved air express.

It says

that the defendant did knowingly transport and carry in
interstate commerce from San Francisco to Milwaukee, and so
on, these materials by common carrier, that is Trans-World
Airlines and North Central Airlines; and I would suppose that
those words could be even more readily read as that he took
them with him on his own trip.
MR. GRISWOLD;

I think you may be right, Mr. Justice.

Sometimes it’s not easy to separate what's in the record from
what one —
QUESTION:

So all we have in the record, I think, is

the —
MR. GRISWOLD:

I think all we have in the record is

12
that he did transport by means of a common carrier.
QUESTION:

"Transport and carry".

MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes.

"Carry".

That's because the statute

says "transport and carry", I believe.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

I would suggest that it's cruite a lot

of stuff to take along with you, 68 reels of —
QUESTION:

Well, there's unlimited weight these days

on domestic airlines.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice?

QUESTION: Well, one can carry a good deal on domestic
airlines these days.
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:
shipment.

Yes.

I agree that the indictment is —

Anyway, it's not clear that this was a

Yes.
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is not clear that this was an

ordinary shipment.
I read the First Amendment, of course, with great
respect and, indeed, gratitude.

I have been in places where

there is nothing like the First Amendment, and I know the
feeling that can be engendered in people who are subject to
such a regime.

But no matter how much I read it, I don't

find anything in it about commercial or private; I don't
find anything in it about children, non-consenting adults,
or pandering.

To the extent that these terms have come into

13
the discussion of these problems, they are obviouslv used to
define or describe concepts or ideas which are derived out of
the First Amendment in some way or another.
Obviously, the First Amendment cannot be limited to
the precise words.
shaking his head.

One can speak by raising his finger or by
It is not limited to actuation of the

vocal chords.
On the other hand, there is very real room to
question how far the expansion of the Amendment should be
carried, how far matters of this sort should be left to
legislative judgment when they do not involve any direct
violation of anything which is contained in the Amendment.
And I mention these ideas about children and non­
consenting adults, and private and commercial, to show how
far the conception has expanded.
QUESTION:

Actually, the New York Times is

commercial; the Washington Post is commercial; the Christian
Science Monitor is commercial,
MR. GRISWOLD:
the previous case.

Yes, Mr. Justice, I argued that in

I don't think that the distinction between

private and commercial can find any support in the Amendment.
I can see some reasons, when one thinks in terms of thought
control, but I don't find anything in the First Amendment that
says anything about thought control.
If one thinks in terms of thought control, then I

14
think he can focus in on the man’s library in his own home.
It was extraordinarily unfortunate that those Georgia officials,
who had power to, under a search warrant, to seize gambling
equipment, took it upon themselves to take materials out of
the man's private library and thereby create a case which
came to this Court.

And I have great sympathy with the

conclusion which was reached, that it was not appropriate for
them to prosecute him for the mere possession of materials
in his own library, though I would have put it on Fourth
Amendment grounds rather than on First Amendment grounds.
I suggest, to say that that establishes a doctrine
that the First Amendment prevents thought control and therefore
this right of privacy must be extended to a man no matter
where he is, no matter what he does, to his luggage, to his
importations into the United States, is to erect a very large
structure on a very narrow base.
QUESTION:

But if you put the standard on

the

Fourth Amendment, then, concededly, they could get a search
warrant and seize it?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes.

Yes, I suppose you could.

And

that, it. seems to me, might conceivably involve a guestion
under the Fourth Amendment, which allows only reasonable
searches and seizures, and a search for printed material, a
man's diary for example, in the privacy of his own home might
well be established by decisions of this Court. The Boyd case

15
approaches it, it doesn't quite qet there, lonq aao, as beinq
beyond the scope of a reasonable search and seizure.
Thusf if this case does involve any question of the
applicability of the First Amendment, to private possession of
obscene material, we would make the same argument here that
we made in the previous case, that there is no appropriate
basis for construing the First or. shall I say. expanding the
First Amendment to make it applicable here, and that the
decision below should be reversed,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shellow.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. SHELLOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SHELLOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Let me at the outset correct, if I may, a few
impressions that may have been left with this Court by the
Solicitor.
The opinion of Judge Doyle in B. & H. Distributing
Company, rendered on September 14, 1972, after remand by this
Court, held only one thing, and that is, it held that Section
1462 is overbroad.

It did not have anything whatsoever to do

with children, it had nothing whatsoever to do with non­
consenting adults, it had nothing whatsoever to do with
pandering,

It merely held that Section 1462, as enacted,

can be applied to constitutionally protected activity; and, for

16

this reason, is overbroad and is therefore void.
Secondly, -- incidentally, Judge Doyle, in that
opinion, assumed for the purposes of that opinion that the
defendants in that case were engaged in the commercial
distribution of obscenity, and he assumed that on the basis
of the fact, among other things, that a large number of
magazines were involved, that it was not — it was transporta­
tion by an express company and, further, that one of the
defendants was the B. & H, Book Distributing Company.

And

he figured that it was a reasonable assumption that it was a
commercial venture.
Second of all, the Zacher case, which has been
alluded to by the Solicitor, is the companion case to Orito.
Zacher and Orito, while charged in different indictments,
were charged with the same transportation.

And so the record

in Zacher flushes out the facts that are of course absent
here, for we are here on an indictment and its dismissal
only.
And in that, in the hearings in Zacher, it is quite
clear that Mr. Justice Stewart's inference is quite correct,
and that is, that the luggage was with him. This was personal
hand luggage, carried on an airplane in the cargo compartment.
So, with those two matters out of the way, I can
address what I conceive to be as the logic of our position.
We approach the Court and ask the Court to look at

17

Stanley, and if Stanley means anything it means that in our
society today a person can read what he wants, can look at
what he wants, can enjoy the kind of material he wants to
enjoy, regardless of whether it has social value or not? that
the private consumption, of ideas is beyond the criminal
sanctions of the Federal Government and beyond the criminal
sanctions of any State, including Georgia.
The question then arises, does it really make any
difference whether X am reading the obscene magazine in my
home or whether I am reading it on an airplane, or whether I
am taking it from my home to my summer home on an airplane
or in a train, and we assert it clearly does not.
That the statute, by its terms, explicitly applies
to the kind of reading to which I referred.

It refers to

persor.s who carry obscene material by common carrier.
is no exception? there is no exclusion.

There

The statute, as it is

written, is overbroad and X think the question is: What do
we do now?
I think, in its last argument, the last time we were
here, and again today the Solicitor suggests that what you do
if you give this statute a limiting construction, and you
limit this construction to apply only to transportation in
aid of or in furtherance of some commercial venture or
distributive process.
Without arguing what the merits of such a statute

18

would bej, and X have serious questions whether such a statute
would be constitutional, it certainly would be a better statute
than the one we have.

And the question then is:

Can this

Court do it?
Can such a limiting construction be placed on
Section 1462, so that the statute, instead of reading "trans­
ports in interstate commerce by common carrier" would read
"transports with intent to sell or distribute".

That's

what would have to be done to this statute, and I submit you
can't do it, and you can't do it for several reasons.
The first reason you can't do it is that Congress
did it and did it in 1894, and the legislative history of this
statute shows that in 1894, in 1896, in 1897, and all the way
up to 1909, this statute included the words "with intent to
sell".
In 1909 there was a general revision of the Penal
Code, and in the general revision of the Penal Code the issue
came up, whether or not we should include in this statute the
phrase that had been there for 15 years.

That is, should we

include in this statute "for intent to sell or distribute".
And the congressional history and the comments of
those who addressed themselves to this bill in the revision in
1909 and 1910 show quite clearly that it was the intent of
those who changed the statute to make the statute now encompass
personal possession, non-commercial possession, non-distribu-

19

tive possession,

And why?

Assemblyman, Congressman Shirley said:
it so that it's consistent with Section 1461.

We want to do

It wasn't 1461

then, it was a different number. I think perhaos 212.
He said. "We want to do it so it's consistent with
the Comstock Act.

The Comstock Act doesn't have any exemption,

doesn't exclude personal distribution by the mails, therefore,
we don't want this one to do it."
symmetry.

Sort of an abstract

That's one.
Secondly, it was pointed out that if this only

co\)ered persons who transport with intent to sell, it would be
impossible to enforce; that nobody could ever prove up a case
under this statute, that we have to have a statute that
covers both personal and commercial transportation, or we'll
never get any conviction.
The statute was changed in 1909, the intent to sell
was dropped out; we have essentially, today, with some changes,
albeit, but not in pertinent parts, the statute that was
adopted in 1909.
And perhaps the argument could be made: Well,
Congress didn't know the kind of reasoning that would come
up in Stanley.
year.

The statute was tinkered with again last

Certainly Congress knew Stanley had been decided by

last year; and last year, when Congress withdrew from the
reach of the statute persons who shipped material advising

20
others to use contraceptive devices, certainly could have
tinkered with the statute in this area as well.

It’s not

as though the statute has never been fussed with; the statute
was changed in 1920 to include motion pictures.

It was changed,

as I say, last year to exclude contraceptive devices.
So the legislative history is squarely against any
rewriting of this statute.

In order to rewrite this statute,

you would have to rewrite it back the way it was in 1094 and
1897, and essentially you'd have to be tellinq Congressman
Vilas, Congressman Shirley, Congressman Houston that you didn't
mean what you said.

And really, the statute, as you oriqinally

enacted it, should be permitted to stand.
I submit that's legislation, that's not adjudication.
Secondly, the second reason that you can't draft
this statute is because one limiting construction won't save
it.

Shall we have a statute that we are going to draft which

will prohibit, as was suggested in our last argument some
months ago, my delivering by interstate carrier my library of
obscenity to the Library of Congress?
statute that excludes gifts?

Shall we have a

Shall we have a statute in

which we will write in a presumption, such as is written into
1465, so that those in the Attorney General's Office in the
Department of Justice have a chance of winning a prosecution
under it?
1465 needs a presumption because without the

21
presumption, nobody would ever get a conviction.
Must you also then write a presumption into 1462?
Yet still another problem:

What shall you do if you’re

going to rewrite this statute for Congress, if you're going to
rewrite this statute for us all, about those jurisdictions in
which it's now lawful for adults to buy, sell, possess, and
transport admittedly obscene material?
I know that Oregon is such a State now.

I’m advised

that Hawaii has recently enacted similar legislation.
Shall you draft into this statute, as has been
drafted into a number of other federal statutes, exemptions, to
exempt those who ship this material into jurisdictions in
which it is not contraband?
I submit this is not such a statute that you can,
that you can rewrite it.

You are not dealing with the

procedural problems of Loros, you are dealing with the whole
fabric of the statute, as you were in Blount vs. Rizai.
The statute must go back to Congress.

It cannot —

it cannot, I submit — be given a limiting construction by this
Court consonant with any of the principles which you have
previously expressed concerning limiting statutes and
interpreting congressional enactments.
This is not a question where you can sever out an
offending word from a statute, there are no offending words.
What you must do is you must take the language of the statute

22
itself and add clauses to it.
Now , in Loros you had a severability statute that
permitted you to sever out certain applications, and perhaps
you could do so.

You don't have the same severability statute

in Title 18.
Now, regardless of how you see the roots of Stanley,
I think it’s possible perhaps to see Stanley having its roots
as a First Amendment problem, as a First Amendment right;
the right, perhaps, to read, the right to acquire ideas.
Perhaps it’s a Fourth Amendment right in kind of a strange
sense:

that the home gives the whole problems of Stanley an

added dimension.
Perhaps also it's a Ninth Amendment right, just the
right to be let alone, the right to read and enjoy what you
like.
And if Stanley

has Fourth Amendment, Fourth Amendment

dimensions, so Orito also has added dimensions.

Althouqh

Orito is on an airplane with his luggage, and Mancusi and Katz
tell us that where one has a reasonable expectation of
privacy, the Fourth Amendment gives him such privacy, other
cases speak to the same issue.
If you lock at Edwards vs. California, a long time
ago, back in 1941, and more recently Dunn vs. Bloomsteln, and
still more recently, I think, Shapiro vs. Thompson, we have
another right.

Somehow Mr. Orito has a right to travel within

23
the continental United States and no one can place a burden
on that right.

I don't know that this Court has ever set

forth clear 3.y what the roots of that right are.

But somewhere,

somewhere in the fabric of our Constitution is Mr. Crito's
right to go from Washington to Milwaukee, and if he can go
from Washington to Milwaukee, if he can go one place to
another, then he can go carrying something, as long as it's
not contraband, as long as it's not goods made with convictmade labor, as long as it's not goocfe made with children, as
long as it's not contaminated food.
What Mr. Orito can read in the privacy of his home
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he can carry with him to California,
for he has the right to read and the right to travel,

and

the two of them come together in much the same way as
Stanley's right to read, and his right to be let alone in
his own home sort of come together.
QUESTION:

But he had nine copies of the same film,

and ten copies of another one, and eight copies of another one.
MR. SHELLOW: And what we do is we look to overbreadth.
Perhaps Mr. Orito is transporting this material in his
luggage as a commercial venture.

Nonetheless, he has standing

to raise the overbreadth of the statute, as you recently said
in Gooding v. Wilson.

He raises the application, even if you

infer from this that .it's a commercial venture, he has the
right, to raise those whose transportation is purely personal.

24
QUESTION:

Well, how could I imagine having nine

copies and ten copies of something to be other than commercial?
My imagination doesn't go too far, but hov? could it?
MR. SHELLOW: All right.

Let us, if you wish —

QUESTION: Why don't you go —
MR. SHELLOW:

— I suggest that we did not

stipulate, as Reidel did, and as Loros did, we stipulate no
commercial venture; we look to the indictment and say the
statute is overbroad.
But even, even if this is a commercial venture, he
has the right to assert the overbreadth of the statute, for it
would apply to non-commercial transportation.
Court in Gooding most recently.

So said this

Orito asserts this standing.

He comes before the Court and says this statute's no good,
and you can't construe it so that it is any good.
And that's why it doesn't make any difference if,
in this case, Mr. Orito has one copy of one dirty magazine,
ten copies of films, or 150 copies.
Incidentally, there is nothing in this indictment
which tells us the films are the same.
kno\A? they are copies, I don't think.
to infer it.

That is, we don't
But let's — I'm willing

I don't think it's central to my argument, and

I don't think it's central to Mr. Orito's rights.
QUESTION:

You say "nine copies labeled number 5",

other than that they are duplicate copies?

25
MR. SHELLOW:

1 read United States vs. Ross, in

which this Court held you cannot pile one inference upon
another»
QUESTION:

But what is there in Roth that had an

indictment in it?
MR. SHELLOW:
QUESTION:

Not Roth, Ross, Your Honor.

Or any other one?

This is "nine copies

labeled".
MR. SHELLOW:

Pine.

Let us assume — I'll concede

that for you, if you want, to you for the purpose of this
argument alone, that they're the same.

Must we conclude from

the fact that they are the same that he's in the business?
I'll even give you that inference.

And yet he has the right

to assume that this prosecution would lie if he had one deck
of playing cards in his pocket on that airplane.
You cannot restrict Mr. Orito's right under a
statute which would restrict my right to bring exhibits to this
Court.
QUESTION: Well, do you agree that you do not have
the personal right in your case, that you had in the case just
before this?
Do you agree with that?
MR. SHELLOW: There is no stipulation in this case
that it was for commercial venture.

If you wish to draw the

inference, and feel the inference is not so attenuated that it

26

can be drawn —
QUESTION: At least you don’t have an admission by
the U. S. Government that it’s for private purposes, do you?
MR. SHELLOW:

I have no admissions from the United

States Government in this case whatsoever.

And we have no

concessions by the defendant, either.
We stand before the Court and say the statute's no
good, it can't be applied to Mr. Orito, and it can't be
applied to Mr. Zacher, and it can’t be applied to me if I
happen to have the exhibits in this case, one copy of them,
as I go back on the plane to Milwaukee.

That is not an

indictable offense, and it can't be made an indictable
offense.

And for carrying exhibits to this Court, I can't

go to the penitentiary for five years.

And you've got to

figure out some way of making the statute say that.

And you

can't do it, because the legislative history is against
you.
You throw the statute out and give it back to
Congress, and say, Give us a statute that comports with the
First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Ninth, and maybe
the Fourteenth.

And maybe the right to travel may be

somewhere woven in there as the right that — let me suggest
to you that maybe, maybe the way to distinguish

away Reidel

and Loros, and I'm not awfully happy with this distinction,
but maybe the way to distinguish it is;

if you're transporting

27
on a common carrier obscene material, you seek no one's
aid but the common carrier, whereas Mr. Reidel sought the aid
of the United States Government in purveying his stuff, as did
Mr. Loros seek the affirmative assistance of our customs
agency.

Those who are prosecuted under 1462 seek no one's

help? we do not seek to make the government a partner in this
enterprise, we just seek to be left alone.
And maybe that's the distinction.

The historic

interest this government has taken and this Court has taken
in the mails, in the customs, we have different rules.

A readine

of the border search problems convinces anyone that customs
problems are sui generis, even in the criminal field.

And yet,

I submit to you, that's a distinction that's a viable one,
perhaps, in this area of obscenity.
For Loros was a customs case, and he sought the
government's help, as Reidel sought it, to use the mails.
I suggest one further problem, that if this statute
is rewritten by this Court, to add the phrase that was deleted
in 1909, and to take us back to the statute that was enacted
in 1894, that would we then not be confronted with a statute
that had no determinable limits?

How can I advise anyone as

to what are the elements of a crime, if all that's necessary
is the intent?
I suggest to you that you said in Compos Sorrano, not
too long ago, that the principle of strict construction of a

criminal statute demands that some determinable limits be
established, based upon the actual words of the statute.
That's what Mr. Justice Stewart said.

The actual words of the

statute don't place determinable limits on it.

The actual

words of this statute make me criminally liable for taking
these exhibits to Milwaukee.

The actual words of the statute

actually conform to what Congress wanted to enact.
Congress wanted to enact a statute that covered the
transportation of material by private persons, not for gain,
not for hire, not for distribution; and Congress enacted such
a law.

And the law is unconstitutional.
And we can't say that, as much as we would like to.
I submit that the language that appears in 37

Photographs, where the Blount case is discussed, is apposite.
Where the Court said that in Blount, and I submit as in Orito,
you're dealing with a federal statute and you have a power to
give it an authoritative construction.

However, in this

case, as in Blount, salvation of the statute would have
required a complete rewriting of it in a manner inconsistent
with the expressed intentions of some of its authors.
The language was from Blount, but the application is
crystal clear to Orito.

There is absolutely no way of

escaping the fact that a rewriting of this statute flies
in the face of what its authors wanted, of what they
explicitly said they wanted, and in this case even more so

they had the statute that you'd have to rewrite, and repealed
it or amended it.
So I suggest that we seek not an extension, really,
of Stanley.

Stanley doesn't say much more, I don't think, than

that an individual has a.
\tfhere he likes.

right to read what he likes and

Stanley wanted to read it in his home,

perhaps I want to read it on an airplane.

As long as I don't

show it to kids, and don't poke the person next to me and
say, "Hey, look at my magazine", I think I have a right to
read it.
QUESTION:

What statute or what part of the First

Amendment brings in that last fact?
MR. SHELLOWs

My right to read?

My right to read on

an airplane?
QUESTION:

The prohibition, at least; as long as

you didn't interrupt another, where does that prohibition
arise?
MR. SHELLOW:

I think just as I have a right to be

let alone, so perhaps does everyone else.

And somehow my

right to read that which may offend others does not extend to
my right to offend them.

And perhaps this Court can't enact

or this Court can't adjudicate good manners.

And maybe that's

all I'm saying.
QUESTION:

Well, can't you — in cases like Pollock

and so on, indicate that there is an affirmative right that

30

your neighbor on the airplane has, or anybody else has not
to read, doesn't the First Amendment include the right not to
read, not to listen to what you don't want to read or don't
want to listen to?
MR, SHELLOW:
QUESTION:

Of course it does.

Of course it does.

More than just —

QUESTION: Well, that was the dissent in Pollock,
not the opinion.
MR.SHELLOW:
QUESTION:

I think that —
In any event, it's been suggested that

the Amendment does include the right not to read.
MR. SHELLOW:

The right not to be exposed to loud

speakers in a bus, perhaps.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Shellow, when you poke your

neighbor on the airplane, that’s not the United States
Government imposing any burden on him.
MR. SHELLOW:

I understand. That’s why I suggested

that there it may be nothing more nor less than good manners.
QUESTION:

Well, yet you suggested, in response to

a question by the Chief Justice, that this is some sort of a
limitation on the First Amendment argument.
MR. SHELLOW:

No.

I suggest that the individual’s

right to — maybe the individual who rides next to me, and
the zone of privacy which surrounds him and his expectation
of privacy, maybe that imposes upon me, under the Constitution,

31
a correlative obligation not to invade it.
QUESTION:

Maybe,

Where is that in the Constitution?

MR. SHELLOW:

I don31 know.

I can’t — maybe it's

First Amendment, maybe it’s the Ninth; I can’t say.
QUESTION:

What it does is authorise the government

to prevent you from poking your neighbor and shovinq this
under his nose.
MR. SHELLOW:
QUESTION:

I’ll buy that.
And that’s the First Amendment.

MR. SHELLOW:

I’ll buy that.

I think that — thank

you — that’s the way I’ll look at it.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Shallow, at least the government

has taken sides, and that right does come to life under it.
MR. SHELLOW:

Unless the government takes some

action, or unless Congress enacts a statute that says that "he
who thrusts obscene material upon his neighbor on an airplane
shall be subject to five years imprisonment and a fine of
ten thousand dollars", then maybe that statute would be
constitutional.
QUESTION:
