MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

.Seatrain Lines.
Mr. Gruis, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. GRUIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GRUIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The practical here before this Court is whether or
not the Federal Maritime Commission is going to be able to
continue under its present statutory authority to effectively
regulate and supervise America's maritime industry.
The matter here this morning comes by way of a
writ of certiorari to the D. C. Court of Appeals which
vacated the Federal Maritime Commission order approving the
merger of assets of one shipping company to that of another
shipping company.
In overruling the commission's order, the D. C.
Court of Appeals found that the commission had no authority
under Section 15 of the Shipping Act authorising it to
approve such sales, thereby giving such transactions
immunity under the antitrust laws.
Sc that we are real certain as to what the facts
of the situation is, in this particular case along about

4
1970 Pacific Far East Lines entered into a contract with
one of Matson's subsidiaries, Oceanic Steamship Company, for
the sale of four ships than in operation, two ships that
were under construction, and associated facilities like
personnel and so on that went along with those ships»
There was a protest on this matter at the
commission level, the commission finding this protest
without substance.

And upon the briefs submitted by the

parties, approved the transaction.

It was immediately

appealed by the protestanfc to the D* C. Court of Appeals.
In the Do Co Court of Appeals, the question was
raised for the first time as to the commission's Section IS
jurisdiction over this type of transaction.

Since the

language of Section 15 is sc critical to our understanding
this morning, I would like to direct your attention either
to page 2 of our brief or to the language of Section 15
itself in the first or second paragraph, I believe, wherein
the third clause or category says that

agreements between

carriers shall be committed to the.commission which are
controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying
competition.
In addition to that, this paragraph goes on to
indicate that agreements also include understandings,
conferences, and other arrangements.
Section 15 also makes'specific provision for an

5
antitrust exemption, for agreements that have come before the
commission and are lawfully approved.

The commission has

operated with this law for over two decades, approving some
transactions formally, others informally, and even rejecting
some transactions that had been presented to it.
The question presented here today was really not
raised in a judicial setting until 1968, some time after the
commission had been operating with this law in approving
merger and acquisition, consolidation transactions.

When

before the commission and subsequently in the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals the question was raised as to whether or not
the last clause of the first paragraph in Section 15, which
is sort of a catch-all clause at the end of that paragraph
and reads, "Or in any manner providing for an exclusive,
preferential, or cooperative working arrangement," whether
or not that clause limits the foregoing six categories under
the Shipping Act that are to be presented to the commission.
This clause was originally rejected in the Ninth
Circuit Court by Matson, the Ninth Circuit Court case, on the
basis of Justice Stewart's decision in Volkswagarrwerk
wherein he indicated that Section 15 and the language used
in that part of the statute is very broad and is very
expansive and probably -would not be circumscribed by this
one category at the end of Section 15.
1 think it is important here for us to understand

5

the type of industry that we are operating in, and I think it
should be immediately apparent that we are really having
problems reconciling two conflicting statutes or perhaps
three conflicting statutes—-namely, the Shipping Act, the
Sherman Act, and the Clayton Act.
But wa submit, first of all, that the initial
purpose and concept behind enactment of the Shipping Act
back in 1916 was to create a specialised and expert agency
to regulate maritime affairs.

If this was the goal or

objective behind the original Shipping Act, then tha
Maritime Commission would not be able to accomplish this
if it has one arm tied behind its back, so to speak, being
unable to act or to oversee transactions that may involve
mergers or consolidations or acquisitions between shipping
companies.
Q

In this connection, did the Maritime

Commission exercise jurisdiction over any merger prior to
1940?
MR. GRUIS:

Not that I know of, no, sir.

There is

no recorded—what X mean by that is that it well may have
been that papers had been submitted to it.

But we have no

reference of any recorded transaction that had acted
unofficially, no, sir.
Q

Was what you just said equally applicable to

those earlier years as to the later ones?

7
MR. GRUIS;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

In this connectionf if I may, .Mr. Justice Blackmun,
is suggest this, that, there was a change in the structure of
the maritime agency back in 1960 when the regulatory arm was
split off from the promotion arm of the maritime industry
insofar as Government regulation was concerned.

It was when

this regulatory arm, namely, the Federal Maritime Commission,
was set up for the purpose of effectively regulating the
Shipping Act statutes it became much more concerned and
interested in the various transactions that were going on in
the maritime industry insofar as acquisitions and mergers
were concerned.
I suggest, gentlemen, that with these two
conflicting statutory goals*--nsmely, the goal of the antitrust
law to preserve a competitive environment and the goal of
the Shipping Act which uses antitrust standards, -is only
one of the criteria—the commission has looked upon these
transactions in the past and endeavored to balance both of
these conflicting public policy aims,
I suggest that in treating this question, for
example, if Justice, for example, were to prevail--the
Department of Justice on this—we would have two different
types of transactions very closely related but entirely
judged by different standards.

It has been suggested in the

brief, for example, that a single ship’s sail to an area.

8

where service may be needed could by Justice Department's
move, or the Federal Trade Commission for that matter of
fact, enjoined that if it mat the tests of Section 7 of the
Clayton Act and the transaction was viewed only as limiting
competition or tending towards monopoly»
The Maritime Commission, X believe, has a bigger
goal, a bigger objective than this under the Shipping Act.
The standards given to that were several sets of standards
aside from purely competitive standards, and those
included—and I think they are also listed in Section 15 of
the Shipping Act—to make a determination as to whether or
not this transaction would be unjustly discriminatory or
unfair between carriers and suppliers, whether or not it
would operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United
States, whether it would be in violation of any other
Shipping Act provision, or whether it would be contrary to
public interest.
Whether or not it would be contrary to public
interest has been read by this Court as including antitrust
standards.
Spensco

That appeared, I believe, in the decision in

where the Court here read right into it that the

commission could not ignore antitrust considerations in
passing or making rulings on any of the transactions coming
before it for approval under Section 15 or upon which the
commission may act on its own motion with respect to

9

transactions.
There has been a question here presented as to
whether or not since the transaction is consummated,
completed, so to speak, it is not saved, according to lower
court, perhaps by having a conditional covenant or some type
oi' revenuable or reversionary interest

follow the sale of

a ship or the closing of an acquisition transaction,

And

the commission has. great doubts as to whether or not this
is a very practical approach, because it soon becomes a
technique in the way you would draft acquisition agreements.
The court below has listed a series of cases, all of ‘Which
it points to as containing some sort covenant not to
compete, but those are not unusual in merger acquisition
transactions if you are buying somebody out.

And still we

do not feel that that is crucial or critical enough to save
this type of transaction from going under antitrust
judgment.
In other words, believe it has stayed fully under
the Shipping Act in all respects.
I believe one of the problems here that is posed
most pregnantly with respect to the policy consideration is
basically this, that when a transaction comes before the
commission, whether it is in the form of an acquisition or
merger, the question always raised is, Is this going to be
tested strictly by competitive standards or is it going to

10
be tested by that criteria that I have explained to you
under the Shipping Act, Section 15.

If the transaction is to be tested

either by the

Federal Trade Commission or by the Department of Justice
in

a

court someplace strictly on competitive standards,

frequently the transactions will fall, even though it may
well satisfy all the other standards of the Shipping Act,
even though it may in the overall view be in the best public
interest, but neither the Federal Trade Commission, operating
under the authority of the Clayton Act, Section 7, nor the
Department of Justice, either under the Sherman Act or the
Clayton Act, could stray too far from that set of
competitive criteria in order to demonstrate that this
merger should or should not be effectuated because of the
public interest.
I suggest what is embraced in those two antitrust
laws is pitted solely on competitive situations, whereas in
the Shipping Act we have other considerations.

Decause

there are instances where a segment of the shipping may be
competitively restrained.
absolute monopoly.

It well may be that there is an

This is true perhaps in many instances

with, port areas where there is a transaction between a port
and a carrier or a port and various servicing functions in
that port which would fully qualify under Section 15.
They would fully also qualify as, an asset under

11
Section 7 standards.

But that port or that area that is

served by this in many instances is a monopoly in and of
itself.

Nobody else can operate this because it is usually

done by some type* of public authority.
If these transactions are thrust into district
court, and 1 believe Judge Merrill in the Matson case points
this out, you would have this paradox where under one set
of standards the transaction

should be carried out but on

another set of standards the transaction

should fail

because of the competitive overtones to it that would
substantially restrain trade.

Judge Merrill in'Matson

felt that this was an impossible situation and such, a test
should not be cast? the Federal Trade Commission, for
example, who jointly with the Department of Justice,
entertains jurisdiction to enforce Section 7 standards.
With due deference to our sister agency, they
may be very specialised in competitive relationships, but
we feel, the Maritime Commission, is bast equipped to
consider what is necessary for our commerce in terms of
maritime and shipping interests, though shipping interests—
and we speak in those terras—-also extend to the shipper
and ultimately to the consumer in the final analysis.
We think, for this reason, that based on these
-•.'.wo considerations the commission is in the best position,
:r the present statutory scheme, to weigh and evaluate
t

12
policy considerations of these two laws»

As I have

indicated, the Court has already told the commission that
it has to take into consideration antitrust standards when
it makes evaluations under Section 15»
So, in effect, what you are doing is you are
ameliorating the relationship between the interest

under

the Clayton Act, for example, together with the interest
under the Shipping Act before a judgment is made, and
that judgment is subsequently rexriewed by a court, under
both those standards.
I suggest this difference in policy has also been
done with respect to other statutes and perhaps the one
most significant at this time is the labor statute wherein
again the' commission was sitting in a position or had a role
wherein it had to look both to in some respects labor
interest

as well as the shipping interest in order to look

at this particular transaction and pass on it.
I would suggest that my agency, with its expertise,
with its flexibility, which was one of the designs of an
administrative agency, can best balance both of those
considerations.
I also submit that if this is thrown into the
court on the antitrust laws too frequently, those other
considerations of other statutes, including the Shipping
Act statutes, will fail if it is measured solely on hard

13

old Sherman Act Or Clayton Act standards.
An argument has been raised-—and it was also
suggested in the court below’s opinion, that because of the
nature of the language and the way it is used in Section 15,
and much of this case turns on how that Section 15 language
is going to be read, is that there was an implied repeal o'f
the antitrust laws.

And the commission is the first to

concede that the docking of antitrust laws not repealed by
implication or exemption, unless fully spelled out, we
fully agree with that.

But we do not think that is the

particular case in this instance.

We think Section 15*s

language is hard, cold, and clear, that that exemption is
given wherever the commission properly approves a
transaction under Section 15 standards.
What has bean cited contrary to our position
have been other types of cases—namely, the Milk Producers
Association case, the Federal Power Commission case,
California v. Federal Power Commission, and the United
States v. Philadelphia National Bank case, which in each
instance was an extension by those other agencies or
departments of antitrust laws to associate with the
transaction before it or just a. usurption of an authority
that was really not there in the first place, and they went
off on an implication that such authority must have been
meant if they were to consider these antitrust considerations.

I also submit to you, gentlemen, that in issuing
your decision in the United States v, Philadelphia National
Bank, you will look to the Federal Maritime Commission's
law to explain to the Controller of the Currency that here
is an instance where specific statutory authority is given
to the Maritime Commission to exempt such transactions.
Yon do not have this.

It is strictly by implication,

Another argument has been raised in an effort to
erode what the commission purports to have as its
jurisdiction, is the specific authority that has bean given
to two other sister agencies, namely, the ICC and the CAB.
•These agencies are. looked at because in fact it is true
that there is specific language written into their
statutes enabling them to expressly treat questions of
pooling, questions of merger, questions of acquisitions,
et cetera.

But I would like briefly to go back a little

bit to explain how that statutory language in those other
statutes came into existence as compared with the Federal
Maritime Commission,
When the Federal Maritime Commission Act was
passed in 1916, that antitrust exemption language was
already there.

The drafters of legislative history, the

people who ware' the

moving forces behind, the Shipping Act

recognized the antitrust overtones involved -with shipping
both domestic and in the international waters and was real

15
certain that this type of exemption was going to be
scmaraly put into the Federal Maritime Commission act—I am
sorry, the Shipping Act, 1960.
This was not true with the ICC

Act that was

originally passed, the o; fanic statute, in 1887.
not have any such antitrust exemption.

They did

In fact, that act,

what haa coma to be known today, made an express
prohibition against pooling, and the ICC was to declare
those illegal under any circumstances <

And it was not

until 1912 that seme further consideration was given under
the Panama Canal Act as to acquisitions and mergers and
relationships concerning railroads and shipping interests
in the United States, that the ICC Act was amended so as to
enjoin railroads primarily from acquiring shipping
.interests that would be competitive or, if they acquired
these interests, to enjoin them from using the Panama
Canal.
But we still do not feel that 1912 has had any
serious bearing upon the Maritime Commission's authority
that was given to it some 40 years later

with all of this

background in mind.
By 1920, the ICC Act was again amended, this time
to approve pooling and to commit certain
conscIllation:

types of

And. in 1920 t think the thinking behind

that law v?as to allow some of our railroads to consolidate

16
and merge and, therefore, ths ICC

wks

supposed to undertake

a study or come up with a plan for extending its railroad
system-:: in the United States.

And this more or less was

really not accomplished, they played with it for a while,
and it was not too efficacious insofar as the way the
legislation was drafted.

So, by 1933 the authority that had

been given to the ICC to devise these plans had been taken
back, and ICC was just given war authority to approve
various types of acquisitions and mergers in the railroad
industry and to give antitrust exemptions with such
acquisitions and mergers.
Again I say this is in 1933.

Meanwhile, the

Federal Maritime Commission throughout has had this
antitrust authority.

It was written in broad language.

In fact, the language is sometimes characterised to that
of the Sherman Act where it is ve.ry simple.

It just says

any agreement that restrains or prevents or stops
competition is covered by Section 15.
By 1940, there is another amendment to the.ICC
Act in this.

There were certain grandfather rights given

in a codification, but it had no immediate bearing on
ICG's authority or power that was specifically developed
over a period of, oh, some 40 years to give this express
antitrust authority to certain types of transactions that
really grew up as a result of the industry structure of

the railroads and overland transportet ion In the United
States.
I would submit that with respect to this ICC Act
h- present bearing of that express language In ICC I do iv.t
think can be used to say that with ICC being given this,
as new situations cropped up and presented themselves in
the railroad and overland trucking industry and so on, that
that is a denial that the Federal Maritime Cdmnissidn had
such general authority way back in 1916 when the law was
enacted.
So, too, with CAB.
passed in 1938.

When that act. was originally

And they looked at that, to various
f

statutes, and CAB was given, specific authority both in
Section 402 and in general authority in Section 412.

But

again the language of both of those sections of the CAB
statute is expressly tailored or geared to aviation or to
airlines or to airplane industry.

And, because by certain

qualifiers it has, it just does not necessarily apply to
the type of problems the Maritime Commission runs into.
I submit to this Court that neither Section 408
nor Section 412, even though it gives express grants to
CAB, in any way derides or undermines the general authority
given the Federal Maritime Commission back in 1916.
With respect to hew the commission end the court©
for that matter of fact, Congress has looked at this

18
.-authority given to the commission in 1916,, I would like to
call the Court’s attention to the 1950 amendments that
were made to Section 7 of the Clayton Act,
There is some argument here whether or not we
arc- looking to post-enactment legislative history, so fcc
apeak,, for coming up with Congress thinks some 30 so years
after the Shipping Act was amended.

But, nonetheless, it

certainly shows that Congress at that time was fully aware,
it shows that the

commission at that time had the intent

to have its jurisdiction applied to acquisitions and
mergers.
Section 7, as you recall, was amended to include
asset as wdll as stock acquisitions under its coverage.
In addition to that, there was a specific exception section
written into Section 7 at that time.

Although there is

some reference in one of the committee reports that this
exemption language was not intended to give any further
rights than a particular agency already have, certainly
the argument is there that if the agency had no rights
they would not put this exemption in in the first place.
The commission made itself very plain when it appeared and
$ ’

testified in connection with this amendment in 1950 that it
had this authority, it had this power, and it was exercising
it.

And there was no challenge by either the Congress or

its members or, for that matter of fact, the Department of

19
•Justice at that time, as to whether or rot this was
authority properly being exercised by the Federal Maritime
Commission.
Q

You do not claim that those * SO amendments

were an affirmative grant of authority to the commission-»"MR. GRUIS:

Q

1 do not.

—you just said they were a. recognition of

the existence—
MR. GRUISs
of that.

It is a recognition of the existence

But I will come to that point in a second/ Your

Honor*.
This type of thinking, Mr. Justice, also prevailed
throughout the Cellar hearings and the Celler report when
the commission was again put under the Congressional

microscope as to how it was operating under its new
structurej namely, it was reconstituted, I guess you would
oay, under Executive Order Seven in 1960, and you now had a
new type of regulatory agency that they were looking at
rather closely to see how they were carrying it out, their
functions particularly with respect to mergers and
acquisitions and concentrations in the shipping industry.
And throughout those Cellar hearings and the Celler Report
the:- e is constant reference to the commission having this
authority and exercising this authority.

And we have

s©£ vched,and X have not coma up with any authority to the

20

contrary, in the CeXler Report of those hearings that the
commission was ever denied having this.
Along' this line, in 1358 there was a major
decision by this Court in the Isbrandtsen Line wherein the
question of dual rights under the Shipping Act came into
play, and this Court found that the statute, as it was
then constituted, did not cover these types of transactions
and they would be subject to antitrust laws, and X believe
there is immediate congressional action to extend the
period of time before these became unlawful so they, could
look at the Shipping Act, perhaps include some amendments,
which they subsequently did.
And 1 would like to talk about this just briefly
because those amendments, those 1961 amendments to the
Shipping Act and particularly Section 15, did make
substantial revision under the law» that we are currently
talking about here.

There were additions; there were new

procedures; there was a new public interest test that was
introduced into that Section 15 amendment in 1961, and some
of this.of course flowed as a result of the Isbrandtsen
decision some two ye airs, three years, earlier, also to
include coverage under the new Section 14(b) relating to
dual rights„
Arguably, this amendment to Section 15 in 1961
allotad Congress to relook at what it did.

It had at that

21
time all the language of Section 15, and it reviewed that
ction

■.

some and including new ones, so that there is almost a
complete overhaul or, as seme referred feo it, a re-enactment
of Section 15 with that congressional intent, real clear.
There is no doubt about that from our reading or from what
has been reported on that»

And that is the language that

we are essentially faced with today.
Throughout those hearings and the amendments
leading to it, the Justice Department had appeared and
was given opportunity to speak on this 3ssue but did not
address itself to it and did not object,
I will reserve my time for rebuttal,
HR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Stibel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRWIN A, SEXBSL, ESQ,,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA
MR. SE1BEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I would

like first to address myself to a couple

points that my Brother Gruis raised during the course of
his argument.

And one was that the question as to the

commissions jurisdiction was first raised in the court of
appe; Is»

1 civ. not think it is relevant.

But lest it may

seem relevant to Your Honors, .1 would like to point out that

22
aid find at least two places in the
record where it was raised before the coiranission.

One, in

■ applicant to
the commission, the applicant for -approval of the
transaction.

In the second paragraph at page 33 the

applicants say that they have been advised fey their
counsel—I sm skipping»-that their transaction does not
require approval by the commission.

Nevertheless, they are

submitting their papers for approval in the event the
commission should differ with them.

So that I think it was

there clearly raised by the applicants, the question of the
commission's jurisdiction to pass on their transaction.
Again, Your Honor, 1 find that on page 52 of the
appendix in footnote one, where the applicants again say,
"We preserve our position that the PFEL/Oceanic agreement
is not subject to Section 15, Shipping Act, 1916,"

I do not think it makes any difference, but it
may to Your Honors,
The other point to which 1 would like to address
myself immediately is the rather lengthy policy argument
that ray Brother Gruis made.

He says that it is desirable

as a matter of policy that the commission be given the
jurisdiction over acquisitions and merger agreements because
he says that the commission is more flexible and it does
take into account antitrust considerations in its decisions.

23
That is certainly an arguable question, of policy
'two ;:cv).x■£:.:■ -differed as to whether or not it would he
desirable.

Judge Merrill in the Ninth Circuit, speaking for

the majority of his panel, thought it would be desirable.
On the other hand, Judge Wilkey, speaking for the court below
in this case, raised a question as to whether or not it
would be desirable.
But that, Your Honors, is a question for Congress.
The question before this Court is whether Section 15 was
intended to grant the Federal Maritime Commission
jurisdiction over mergers and acquisitions, and that is the
question Your Honors have to decide.
1

think that my

Brother Gruis was assuming that

the commission had jurisdiction and was pointing out how
good it: is arid how desirable it is that they should have it.
The Shipping Act does not provide a pervasive
regulatory scheme for the shipping industry.

It was never

intended to do that and it does not do it today.

It does

not regulate entry; it does not have the general power to
set rates, maximum-minimum rates«
What the Shipping Act was intended to do was to
place under Government supervision the practices of shipping
lines which banded together in setting up trade restraining
agreements through the instrumentality of conferences.
These are

associations of shipping lines.

And essentially

24
that was what was intended -where the shipping lines worked
out agreements whereby they regulated rates among themselves,
they

-egulated sailings, they allotted ports# and it was

that' type or trade restraining agreement that Section 15 was
designed to cover,
I would like to turn to the language of Section .15
very briefly.

While I think it is inconclusive, X think

our reading of Section 15 is more reasonable than the one
that the commission suggests.

Your Honors, I think you

will find the pertinent parts of that set forth in the
appendix to the cert petition.
document.

It is a grey covered

And an page 19 it reproduces Judge Wilkey’s

opinion in this case where he sets forth the Shipping Act or
portions of it as it was originally enacted.

I do not think

any pertinent changes were made in 1961 for our purposes.
On page 19, Judge Wilkey sets forth in a series
the seven categories of agreements which Section 15 covers.
Your Honors, if we remove the middle category, which the
r

opinion labels clause three and on which my

Brother Gruis

relies principally, that is the category of agreements
controlling, preventing, and so forth, competition.

If we

remove that for a moment and examine all the other
categories, the first is an agreement fixing rates, clearly
an ongoing type of agreement.
The second is agreements giving special rates

and accommodations , another of the same type*

I will skip

the third, which is the one my Brother Gruis relies on.
The fearth are agreements pooling or apportioning,
earnings,

Again, cm agreement of an ongoing type that is

susceptible to continuing supervision by the agency.
The fifth are agreements allotting ports or
regulating sailings.

Again, an agreement of the same type.

The sixth are agreements regulating the volume of
traffic.

Again, these are agreements of an ongoing nature.
And then, finally, there is a catchall provision.

Agreements in any manner providing for an exclusive
preferential or cooperative working agreement.
Clearly, those five agreements are all of the same
t

type as the one in the final clause.

They are specific and

unambiguous agreements of an ongoing nature.

And the last

is obviously a generalised type describing the same type of
agreements as were previously described.

Xt seems to be

quite reasonable to read—
Q

Hr. Seibel, the last is obviously a

generalised step.

X can see how you can argue it, but it

is not to me crystal clear that that—
MR, SEIBEL:

I mean, obviously in the sense that

it is generalized rather than specific, Your Honor, is what
I meant, rather than—all I am suggesting, Your Honor, is
not that the language is conclusive.

I am suggesting that

26
in is failure to read- the; language as we urge father than as
the commis: sion urges.

And in view of the fact that the

language on which it relies is in the middle of the specific
and unambiguous clauses that it is intended to he of the
same type as the other clauses immediately preceding it and
following it, and that the last clause,, the generalised
clause, was summarizing the kinds of agreements that,
preceded it? that is, trade

restraining agreements,

agreements of an ongoing nature which are susceptible of
continuing supervision by the agency.
Support for this construction is provided in the
paragraphs immediately following,

I will take one.

Perhaps we cannot dwell on this too long because X think
the conclusive answers are in the legislative history and
in contemporaneous and subsequent legislation where Congress
was very explicit when it wanted to give an agency
authority over acquisitions and mergers, wherein the same
statute Congress gave the agency jurisdiction over
agreements: in one clause and in a separate clause specifically
addressed itself to acquisitions and consolidations.
Conceptually Congress thought of them as being of a
different breed, and I think this is true in the case of
the Shipping Act.
In the paragraph immediately following the clauses
I jus.-.- quoted- —hhit appears on page 20 of the appendix—1

27
will take oae.

There are three such paragraphs.

I think

one is sufficient to illustrate the point I am trying to
make.

It provides that the commission may disapprove an

agreement—I am s:.ippiny—whether or not previously approved
by it,
I think that an acquisition agreement is not
readily susceptible of that type of treatment.

That is,

onea it is consummated, why it is gone and has disappeared
generally.

Whereas, an agreement of a continuing nature,

that is, the conference agreements which regulate rates
involve the participation of the parties over a period of
time and therefore, when the commission may originally
approve it, it may later disapprove it.

It is that type of

distinction which I am urging on the Court,
legislative history bears this out.

And I think the

I think it is quite

clear—it is not that the legislative history doss not
reflect a concern by th©'committee, the Alexander Committee,
which is, as Your Honors know, the committee that
investigated the shipping industry in this period, it is not
that that committee was unaware of or was unconcerned with
the problems of acquisitions—-indeed they were.

In the

domestic trade they discussed them at length, and they were
quite concerned about the railroads gobbling up the waterlinar- in the intarc&ctfcal trade and on the Great Lakes.
T::,&y pointed out th-'-.t 50 percent of all the tonnage in the

28

country was moving through water carriers that were owned
or controlled by the railroads.
Q

This was back in nineteen—

MR. SEIBELs

1910-11-12, yes, Your Honor.

The point is not merely that they were concerned
but that they simply did not recommend any legislation
because the Panama Canal Act, to which they explicitly
refer in the Alexander Report, because that act, which was
passed in .1912, they say, went very far towards eliminating
the evils that were presented by railroad dc.udnatJ.on of the
water carriers in the domestic trade.
In contrast, Your Honors, the language in the
Panama Canal Act with the language with which we axe
concerned here, remembering that the Panama Canal Act is
specifically referred to in the report containing the
recommendations which Congress adopted in the Shipping Act.
The Panama Canal Act

excerpts which 1 have set forth in

Justice’s brief on page 24--in the Panama Canal Act, Congress
mads it unlawful for any railroad—and I quote—"to own” —
it did not use the word "agreements"—"to own or control or
have any interest whatsoever by stock ownership or
otherwise, either directly or indirectly”—et cetera, et
cetera—"of any common

carrier by water."

It did not use

the word "agreements."
Also

the latei: amendment—-this was an

29

amendment to Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act—
contrast the laguage Congress used in the 1920 amendment,
which occurs very shortly after the Shipping Act.

That

amendment dealt both with agreements, both with the pooling
agreements and agreements of a continuing character and
with acquisitions and mergers.
The pertinent language of that statute. Your
Honor, is set forth on the top of page 26 and in the
footnote.
The amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act at
that time, which was Section 5(1), dealt with agreements
and it made it unlawful, unless approved by the commission,
Interstate Commerce Commission, I quote, "for any common
carrier to enter into any contract, agreement, or
combination with any other common carrier through the pooling
of freights or to divide between them the aggregate or net
proceeds of the earnings."
There we are talking about agreements, which is
what we have here»

And in the immediately following

paragraph of that statute in 1920, which we have quoted in
the text on page 26, the same page, Congress banned
interlocking ownership.
requisitions there.

They are talking about

And I am quoting:

"The acquisition by

one carrier, in brackets, of the control of another, in
brackets, under release or by the purchase of stock in any

30
other manner not involving the consolidation of such
carriers into a single system."
The point of this contrasting language is to show
that Congress- knew how to use the different jargon to
describe the difference between an agreement, which io
involved in Section 15, end an'acquisition or merger
consolidation, which is a very different bread of animal,
at least conceptualistically in the minds of the Congress.
And, as a matter of fact, if Your Honors go through the
very lengthy Alexander Report, as 1 am sure Mr. Justice
Stewart probably had to for the Volkswagen opinioni» Your
Honors,, will find that the word '"'agreement” is used from
beginning to end to refer only to cooperative working
agreements, agreements- of a continuing kind, rate making
agreements, pooling agreements; never, never to acquisitions
or mergers.
And the Alexander Committee did use the words
"acquisitions, consolidations, and mergers," but it used
them to refer precisely to that.

And I would like to read

one paragraph which shows the contrasting use in the same
sentence by chat committee of an agreement and an acquisition,.

And this is not really

If Your Honors will review the focus of the

committee on the problem that was bothering it, the problem

of conference abuses at the time, which led the committee
to recommend the enactment of particularly Section 15,
with which we are her© concerned'.
During the last half of the 19th century, there
ware & great, many vessels that were built which produced &

wars.

And - this surplus capacity led to rate

This wss undesirable from the standpoint -of shippers

because of the instability it created.

They never could

tell when they were going to have a vessel available for
importers and exporters.

It was undesirable from the

32
standpoint of the carriers because of the potential for
destruction, these destructive rate wars.
To avoid costly struggles, most of the linea
banded together to regulate the terms on which they
competed.

Host of the lines belonged fc© cartels.

This is

all reflected in the Cellar Report which is cited in both
briefs.

Most belonged to cartels known to us as conferences,

associations of shipping lines.
Through these conferences the lines were able to
agree in ways to moderate the rigors of competition, how to
punish the disloyal shipper who shipped on a non-conference
vessel, how to regulate the rates between them.
While this brought about some stability, it
understandably led to abuses.

And so Congress in 1912

authorised a committee to investigate these practices.

The

e©Eirdttee wrote a detailed report, which we referred to
many times—my Brother Gruis did and I
Alexander Report.

have.

It is the

The report was based in large part, so

far as. the foreign trade was concerned, on an examination
of 60 agreements, 80 written agreements.

There, were many

secret agreements, a practice which the Shipping Act was
designed to correct, to bring them out in the open and put
them under Government supervision.
What, ia striking about thesis 80 agreements is
that every single one of the 80 agreement® is a cooperative

3
working agreement, the pooling type, regulating rates.

"i

Not

a single one of the 80 agreements examined by the committee
in the foreign trade was a merger agreement or an acquisition
agreement.

All were of an ongoing nature.
The committee recognized that these agreements

had many advantages.

The problem was how to preserve the

advantages while minimizing their potential for abuse.
advantages were clear.

The

The regularity of sailingsi if they

were assured of particular rates, the vessels would sail
regularly.

The importers and exporters ware fairly certain

about the rates that were going to be charged.

So, they

knew what to charge themselves.
If unrestricted competition—if the committee
were to recommend outlawing these agreements and unrestricted
competition were the mode of life in the shipping industry,
the inevitable result would be—and this the committee
describes rather picturesquely and at great length--the
inevitable result v?ould be rate wars resulting in uncertainty
in rates and schedules, the destruction of weaker lines,
and protective mergers and consolidations, with monopoly as
a consequence.

That was the analysis made by the committee.

On the other hand, if they allowed these trade
restraining agreements, the fixing of rates, the pooling,
and it were placed under Government supervision, the
advantages would be preserved, the committee pointed out,

34
and also this would avoid the harm to structural concentra­
tion in the industry.

You would not have as a result of

destructive rate wars the lines either going out of
business or getting together and consolidating.

So# one

reason for recommending that these agreements of an
ongoing natur® b© authorized under Government supervision
was to avoid forcing these irretrievable and permanent
consolidations among the shipping lines.
Agreements to merge were simply not the kind of
agreement the committee deemed necessary to immunize from
attack under the antitrust laws.
I have already mentioned that the committee was
aware of

the problem of acquisitions and mergers in the

domestic trade and made no recommendation as to those.

I

have mentioned that the committee used the word '’agreements'*
in a very distinctive sense,

certainly not to include

mergers and consolidations.
I think the question before Your Honor» whether or
not it would be desirable, as my Brother Gruis suggests, as
a matter of policy 1 think is debatable.

But the question

r
before Your Honor is whether Congress intended in Section

IS to give the agency the authority to pass on mergers and
acquisitions# and that is the only question before Your
Honors , and X submit that the evidence is overwhelming
against that grant of authority.

35
Q

Would you suppose, if you arsi correct on this

issue, which is the. only issue before us, whether or not
Section IS gives the «^mission—whether this is some-thing
that is Silable under IS and if the commission approves is
immune from the antitrust acts, that is the question—
MR. SEX BEL:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—“Would you suppose that, if you are right,

that it is not that the full fore© of the antitrust laws
would—it would follow they would apply to this
acquisition.
MR. SEIBEL:

Yes, sir.

I am not suggesting a.

Q

MR. SEIBEL:

And that, of course, is not the point.

MR. SEIBEL:

Because certainly the legislative history

—and, therefore, is probably not to be the

And I think it quite clear, I think it is

quite clear from an examination of the history# that evert
though they were aware of acquisitions, they did not mean to
include them in Section 15g they did point out in their
report—they did refer to the Panal Canal Act which deals
specifically with that problem.

MR. SB I EEL j
Q

Well# 1 think it was later found

—it probably was.

But. nobody knew it was at that time.

MR. SEIBELs

No,

Stock acquisitions, I think#

were the predominant mod© of mergers end acquisitions# but
that is right. Your Honor.
I would like to point out# though# my Brother
Gruit# if 2 may have one further word# has indicated that
it probably would not make much sense to say that an
acquisition# if it is covered—he referred to a transaction
where an acquisition was accompanied by an ancillary#

37
ongoing covenant not to compete.

The latter by itself

would be the kind of agreement* we would concede* that is
within Section 15.

He suggests that it would net make sense

to make the distinction to say it is, and therefor® the
commission can pass on the whole transaction.
I agree with him that it would not make sense to
say, if the acquisition is not subject to the commission
jurisdiction, I do not think that the Court should ©ay that
the acquisition-—wa deal with that at the end of our brief—
that the acquisition accompanied by the ancillary covenant
not to compete or some ancillary restraint, would, just
because the parties cast their agreement in a particular
form, should bring the transaction within the commission's
jurisdiction for that reason.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. GRUIS, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRUIS:
Mr, Chief Justice.

X would like to add only on® point,
With respect to legislative history, I

did not address myself to that because there is really
nothing definitive in the legislative history one way or
another.

Mr. Seifoei addressed himself in his brief very

appropriately as to what it says one way.

We think we have

equally covered the ground on the other side of the brief
as to what it says on the other side.
We believe Justice Stewart in Volkswagen points,
out on® particular section of the committee’s recommendation
wherein it expressly covers agreements by vessels engaged in
the foreign commerce of the United States.
Secondly, I would like to raise one further
question.

As with the schematics of putting Section 15

together, about clause three standing out or being the
single exception to all the other ongoing type of clauses,
I submit, Yorr Honor, if this is what the committee had in
the back of their mind, we could have eliminated clausa
three completely because it would have been covered by clause
seven, according to Mr, Selbel*a discussion.
We think- this Court should reverse the court
below and find fchut the commission does have authority under
Section 15 of the Shipping Act to pas's, on mergers and

43
acquisitions.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Gruis.
