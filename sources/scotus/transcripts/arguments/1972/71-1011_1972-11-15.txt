ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON H. ELSEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELSEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Petitioner was convicted on one count of perjury
under the federal perjury statute, 18 USC 1621.
The appeal raises issues relating to the legal
standards applicable under the federal perjury statute.
The conviction was affirmed in a split decision of
the Circuit, two to one.
Mow, the facts are quite simple and I will put them
briefly.
The perjury arose out of interrogation in a hearing,
the alleged perjury, and that's the question.

The hearing was

in a bankruptcy court before a referee in bankruptcy.

The

questioning was done by an attorney, for one of the creditors.
The examination was under Section 21(a).
Now, the petitioner had a company.

He was the sole

4
stockholder and the president.

The company had filed a

petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.
The purpose of the 21(a) examination was to inquire
into assets of the corporation.

Because of the petitioner’s

relation to the company, as president and sole stockholder,
creditors and their counsel were entitled, if they so chose,
to ask about his personal assets.

And there is no dispute

on that question.
Late in the afternoon of the examination, four
questions were asked, which are the subject of this case.
They're set forth at page 3 of our brief.
The two crucial questions were;
"Question: Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss
banks, Mr. Bronston?
"Answer;

No, sir.

"Question;
"Answers

Have you ever?
The company had an account there for about

six months, in Zurich."
The last tv?o questions related to nominee accounts,
and they are of no further consequence here.
The government did not dispute the truthfulness of
either of these answers.

Mr. Bronston had had a personal bank

account in Geneva, and the prosecution proceeded on the theory
that he committed perjury by not saying so in answer to the
second question;

"Have you ever?"

5

Nov;, it was undisputed that the account had been
closed some two years before the questioning took place, and
that it had been dormant for some four years before the
questioning took place.
There were no assets in the account, and there had
not been any assets beyond an insignificant amount since 1962,
some four years before the questioning, some two years before
the company filed its petition for an arrangement.
Although the accounts asked about were in Switzerland,
this was not a numbered account.
name.

It was in Mr. Bronston's

It was opened in an ordinary commercial transaction.

His company did business in Switzerland.

It v;as an

international company that did business all over the world.
He had a child in. a school in Switzerland.
He drew checks on this account, and he signed them
with his name.
QUESTIONS Did the government know this -— did the
prosecution know this at the time, or *—
MR. ELSENs At the time that they chose to indict?
QUESTION:
MR. ELSENs

At the time they questioned him?
You mean whether the attorney for the

creditor knew all this?
QUESTION:

No, the — at this hearing, at that time

did the government know that he had had an account there?
MR. ELSEN;

I don’t know that, Mr. Justice Douglas.

6

The government was not a party to the hearing.
QUESTION s

I understand —

MR. ELSEN;
QUESTION;

It was a private hearing.
When did the — the government found out,

but when did it find out?
MR. ELSEN; A creditor brought the information in to
the government about the bank account, because Mr. Bronston
had given his creditors a general waiver, so they could go
into any bank account.

The government did not call the man in

to explain it, and they simply indicted.
I represented him at that time.

It is not in the

record, but I can tell you, we were never called in to talk
about this case. And I would suspect that had this been
explained, that there would not have been an indictment.

But

of course that's not a question of law.
QUESTION;
evasive answer?

You don't suggest that this was not an

I'm not suggesting that's the issue in the

case, but — he's not indicted here -MR. ELSEN;

You mean as to the question of the

exercise of prosecutive discretion?
QUESTION;

Mr. Chief Justice —

No, I'm speaking of the answer he gave

to the creditor.
MR. ELSENs

Mr. Chief Justice, I would say this,

and I want to answer your question directly, that had the
witness been a candidate for high office and had answered

7
the questions in this fashion, and if I were sitting on a
committee appraising it, I would be troubled by this kind of
answer; but I would not have prosecuted him criminally.
QUESTION?

Well, that's why I put the question.

MRo ELSEN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Is it an evasive answer?

It is an

evasive answer —
MR. ELSEN:
I will get into that.
QUESTION:

No, I don't say that it's evasive, and
It may have been evasive.
Judge Lumbard thought it was — as I

read his dissent —- thought it was an evasive answer that
should have put the questioner in search of more answers.
MR. ELSEN:

Judge Lumbard proceeded on the assumption

that the question was not ambiguous.

If the question was

directed at personal accounts, Mr. Chief Justice, then, of
course, an answer about the company's account was a patently
unresponsive answer and should have put the questioner on
notice that he had to ask another question, and get an
answer about a personal account.
Judge —
QUESTION:

Judge Lumbard's theory, as I read his

dissenting opinion, was that it was an unresponsive answer and
a true statement.
MRp ELSEN: Correct,

That's correct.

QUESTION: And it should, in turn, have led the

8
questioner to pursue it if they were thinking about a perjury
proceeding.
MS. ELSEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ELSEN:

If he was interested in the account.
Yes.
If he was interested in a personal

adcount, he should have pursued this.

He had a question

answered, a truthful answer about the company.
was in Chapter XI, not the individual.

The company

If, indeed, he were

interested in a personal account, he should have known that
he had not received information about a personal account and
should have asked that next questions What about a personal
account?

That's what Judge Lumbard said, indeed.
Now, there are — just to — I think I have

essentially completed the general picture of the facts, and
I have mentioned that the account was uncovered — not
uncovered, but the records were procured by a creditor who
had been given, along with other creditors, a general waiver.
Now, there are essentially three issues, one of
which I will not discuss, the third being related to the
evidence, I will not discuss that.
But I would like to frame it, and the Chief Justice
has already taken me down that line, but if I may frame the
issues:

either the question "Have you ever?" was ambiguous,

in which case there should have been questioning to dispel
the ambiguity.

But there was not perjury.

It was ambiguous

9
because if a company executive is askeds

"How many cars did

you manufacture in June,, Mr. Ford?" , the word "you" applies to
a company.

"How long have you been driving?" applies to an

individual.

"Do you have any bank accounts in Switzerland, or

have you had any bank accounts in Switzerland?" could apply to
either.
And this is particularly true in the context of an
American bankruptcy of an international company, because the
assets in Switzerland or other foreign jurisdictions would not
be under the jurisdiction of the American bankruptcy court, and
creditors may very well have chosen to inquire into company
accounts abroad, so that they might seek some form of
ancillary bankruptcy.
There was indeed one in Spain; a creditor may have
chosen to go into Switzerland.

And that's another reason,

Mr. Chief Justice, why I say it's not all that clear that this
was an evasive answer.
Judge Lumbard proceeded on the assurnPt:i-on that he
must have been talking about a personal account.
But when you reflect upon the problems of
international bankruptcies of companies with assets all over
the world, it's not unreasonable to believe that the witness
thought he was being asked about the company's accounts.
He answered about the company's accounts; and if the
questioner meant personal, he could have said so.

10

But if we assume, as Judge Lumbard said, that it x^as
not ambiguous but x?as directed to a personal account, then
the questioner could not have been put off, it was patently
unresponsive.

It was about a company account.

And that raises, then, the second question of whether
a truthful and clearly unresponsive ansv^er should be the basis
for a criminal conviction of perjury.
Now, it is that second question x^hich I think
raises the most intriguing conceptual problems, and which the
Court may very well wish to ask more questions about.

But

I have chosen to argue first the question of ambiguity for
the purpose of the clarity of the argument.

I think you will

find that if we have discussed that first, the whole discussion
will proceed in a more easily followed manner.
When I begin the discussion of policy, I want to
came back again to the point that I was discussing with the
Chief Justice? that is, this is a criminal case.

It's

obvious, but it is fundamental here.
There was reference in some of the briefs to the fact
that we want to encourage great candor v?hen we have persons
coming for executive commission and judicial appointment and
admission to the bar, and I do not question any of that.

I

think that if we were passing on the admission of a person to
a P°sifion of high public trust we would insist on the absolute
maximum forthcoming type of candor in disclosure*

11
But that's a far cry from dealing with the question
of a layman being asked questions by a lawyer who is satisfied
with the answer, does not go on to ask the next question, and
to put the layman in jail, or to brand him a felon. And that,
I submit, is the issue here.
said too often.

It's obvious,but it can't be

That's the issue.

QUESTION:

Well, there's no question the jury found

that he knew he was telling a falsehood or answering the
question falsely?
MR. ELSENs

Mr. Justice White, the --

QUESTIONS And is it your point that even if the jury
found that, it's like any other case where there shouldn't
have been —* there wasn't enough evidence to go to the jury?
It should have been
MR. ELSENs

That's correct, although, Mr.- Justice

White, I would probably prefer to phrase it in terms of the
fact that the case on the evidence, on the government's
evidence, did not fall within the standard which we should
set down for a criminal case of perjury.
That's another way of putting the same thing.
QUESTIONS

Nevertheless, the jury — you don't take

any exception to the form of the instructions to the jury?
Do you?
MR. ELSENs Well, we're not raising that point on this
appeal

12

QUESTION;
MR. ELSENs

No, but if you ~
The government did say, at one point,

that the ambiguity issue was charged to the jury? and that's
not so.

We've set forth the entire charge on this.

The

c harge on ambigijity was specifically directed to the second
count.
QUESTION: But the constructions seem to appear to be
wholly consstent with the statute, and require the jury to
find the elements of the offense under the statute.
MR. ELSEN:

Yes.

That's correct.

QUESTION; And the jury found them?
MR. ELSEN:

The instructions were -- the judge

charged to the contrary of our position on the question of
a truthful answer, and the jury, following that instruction,
found that —
QUESTION:

So the jury found the elements of the

offense, or they wouldn't have —
MR. ELSEN: That's correct.
QUESTION: Assuming that they followed the instruction?
MR. ELSEN: That's correct, assuming that the elements
were correctly stated by the judge.
QUESTION:

But your point, nevertheless, is that the

case should never have gone to the jury on those facts.
MR. ELSEN:
QUESTION s

Should never have gone to the jury.
Yes.

13
MR. ELSENs That it should have been dismissed on
motion at the close of the government’s case.

Failing that,

it should have been set aside at the end of the case.
Now, on the question of ambiguity, we do have some
Circuit Court authority, which — incidentally, I might start
by saying that neither of these issues seem to, before, have
been before this Court.

We do have Circuit Court authority

which says that an ambiguous question should not form a basis
for a charge of perjury, where the answer to one possible
meaning is truthful.

We have Circuit Court authority supporting

Judge Lurnbard's opinion.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Elsen, —

MR. ELSENs

Yes.

QUESTION s

— am I right in thinking that both

Judge Oakes and Judge Lumbard concluded the question was not
«

ambiguous?
MR. ELSENs

That is correct. The entire Circuit was

against us on this question.
But I think, in all fairness, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
that the court erred in that respect, and I urge that error
before this Court.
The most thoughtful study of the whole law of perjury
that we have uncovered is the comprehensive study of the
American Lav/ Institute, which is embodied in detailed comments
to the draft of the Model Penal Code.

That seems to be the

14
one place where not only the law is explored, but a detailed
and careful examination of the rationale underneath the law is
set forth.

And: on the question of ambiguity the American Law

Institute says ■— and I want to define the words "official
interrogation" as they used it; that means interrogation under
the Model Penal Code before an officer, a judge, a referee,
and the like.

That is the type of interrogation we have here.

The American Law Institute concluded —
QUESTION s What page is this on?
MR. ELSEN; That's at page 2 of our Reply Brief,
Mr. Justice Powell,
"It does not seem unfair to require official
interrogation to be sufficiently specific so that the verity
of declarant's statements can be measured against something
else than a guess as to how he interpreted the question."
"Against something else than a guess",
The Sixth Circuit, in developing a related
rationale, five years ago, said that you cannot have a fair
test of the witness’s belief in the truthfulness of his
answer, where the question propounded admits of several
plausible meanings.
Now, says the government, the ambiguity is
eliminated by the question preceding the "Have you ever?"
because it reads, "Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss
banks, Mr. Bronston?"

15
Now, I would submit that you could ask Mr. Ford,
"How many cars did you manufacture in June, Mr. Ford?" and
that would not make it a question about personal activity.
QUESTION: Well, what do you say the first question
was directed at, and what do you say the witness thought it
was directed at?
MR. ELSENs

Well, what I say the first question is

directed at is bank accounts? and bank accounts could be the
property of the company, which was the subject of the examina­
tion, Mr. Chief Justice, or the individual, or the —
QUESTION: Do you think the first question was
ambiguous?
MR. ELSEN:

Yes, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice? I do,

indeed.
This is in a —
QUESTION:

I guess you say that because of the

context -—
MR. ELSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, this is —
~ of an inquiry in the bankruptcy

proceeding involving the corporation?
MR. ELSEN: Correct,
QUESTION: That’s the premise of it.
MR. ELSEN:

That is quite correct.

That is the major

premise of the entire ambiguity.
QUESTION:

And what you say the fact was, the fact

16

was, afc the time this question was, the corporation no longer
had a bank account; is that correct?
MR4 ELSEN: The corporation no longer had a bank
account —
QUESTIONS But did he?
MR. ELSENs
QUESTION:

He no longer had a. bank account.
— at the time.

So whether he took it as

addressed to him personally, or as ''you” meaning the
corporation; in neither instance, the fact was that neither
had a bank account at that time, is that right?
MR. ELSENs That's quite correct.
QUESTION:
MR. ELSENs

So that was truthful in that respect?
That is truthful.

But it also does not establish a context of inquiry
into personal bank accounts.
I think I have suggested in my opening remark why
it is that the witness could reasonably have reached this
conclusion.
QUESTION:
MR. ELSEN;
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Elsen, ~~
Yes.
*— would you say that —• I gather your

basic premise is that in this series of questions, wherever
the interrogator uses the word "you", the inference ought to
be that Mr. Bronston understood "you" to be the corporation?
MR. ELSEN: Well, I don't believe that I have to go

17
that far, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTIONs
last questions

Yes.

Because I was wondering about the

"Have you any nominees" —

MR. ELSEN:

Well, companies could have nominees.

As a matter of fact, that's a common practice of foreign
corporations, to use nominees in Swiss banks in order to open
up the, an account without having to comply

with Swiss banking

law for corporate resolutions and the like.

It gets rather

intricate.

They often use individuals for that purpose,

So that that very well could have been.
The point is we were dealing with an intricate
situation.

And the witness may have thought one thing, he

may have thought the other. The point is, before we make this
perjury, we should not have to guess.

It's not fair. That’s

what the ALI says.
QUESTION:
MR. ELSEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ELSEN:
QUESTION:

He took the stand, did he?
At the trial?
Yes.
He did not take the stand.
He did not.

MR. ELSEN: Did not take the stand.
There were witnesses from the company who testified
that, the account had not been kept secret. There was nothing
chat the petitioner had to add to that*
There was no case but the fact that there was an

18

account, which he conceded at all times. As a matter of fact,
the Swiss bank officer who testified for the government
testified under

with Mr, Bronston’s permission, which we

sent to Switzerland, because of the requirements of the Swiss
banking laws,
So there is no dispute about the fact of this
account. The question was what was going on during the
interrogation.
Now I turn to the other horn of the issue.

The

question which starts with the assumption, which 1 submit is
really unrealistic here, but starts with the assumption that
the inquiry was clearly and unambiguously addressed to personal
account.
And in that context we have an unresponsive answer,
which the creditor"s lawyer could readily have cured by
asking a questions

Have you personally ever had any Swiss

bank accounts?
He could have insisted easily on a responsive
answer if he wanted one. The referee was right there.
The witness would have had to answer the questions, if the
lawyer had wanted to ask them.
QUESTIONS

Does the referee have the sort of

contempt power that a district court would have in a case of
a genuinely obdurate witness?
MR. ELSENs

Oh, yes.

I think that the referee has

19

to invoke the aid of the district court, but there's no —
QUESTION:

Could he, on the spot, say "Either

answer the question or" —
MR. ELSEN:

Oh, he could direct him, yes. The

referee will direct, "You answer that question",
QUESTION: But if the man doesn't, in response to the
referee's direction, then the referee must seek the aid of
the district court?
MR. ELSEN:
Rehnquist.

I believe that's the law, Mr. Justice

But, nevertheless, may I say that the atmosphere

of the referee's court is a courtroom, and the obdurate
witness is a rare sight, a rara avis, indeed, who will quarrel
with that referee sitting on the bench,
And I might also point out that the right of counsel
is not generally recognized.

The witness doesn't — if he

oesdnot have a lawyer, he has the right to get up and say,
"I object,"

A witness who is on his own.

Now, there was a lawyer sitting there for part of
the hearing, but the referee made it clear what the practice
is in the bankruptcy court.
We do not make an issue of this point, because X
think that there is — the issue that we raise here has to do
with interrogation; but that is part of the setting.
QUESTION:

What was it, the significance of whether

or not he personally had a bank account, what did you say, four

20

years earlier or something?
What was the significance of that?
MR. ELSEN:

You mean why do we concede materiality?

That’s really —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ELSEN: We conceded materiality because the law
is extensive, that in a bankruptcy, we will not dispute the
fact, you could have asked about just about anything that he
had done during a period of —
QUESTION:

I mean was the estate in any way

disadvantaged?
MR. ELSEN:

No.

No.

No, there wasn’t a nickel to

be had, or the estate in any way to be affected by the answer
to a question about this personal bank account? and no one
has ever taken any action as a result of the disclosure of
...the transcript of this account, which was procured in
response to his waiver of bank secrecy.
So that it has had no effect.

But we have not

argued the question of materiality simply because of the law
in this area, it is against us on that question, and we do
not dispute it.
Now, I would like to point out, before I sit down,
the broad sweep of a rule that would permit a criminal
conviction for a truthful but nonresponsive answer.
Because the nonresponsive question occurs every day

21
in the law.

The most honest witness who is being examined in

pretrial depositions, the witness who does not want to volunteer
about his other business affairs, about his friends' lives,
about his private life, and who will wait until he is pushed,
that witness comes up all the time.
Now, you may say in a pure, platonic society, maybe
we shouldn't be that way; but that's the way the real world
is, and I think that we all know that from our experience at
t he bar.

This goes on constantly.

And witnesses sometimes don't know why the lawyer
doesn't press him.

The witness — the lawyer may shift his

interest, he may decide to use a different line of inquiry, or
he has what he wants, he doesn't want to get into a dispute
over a point, he doesn't want to go down to court to get a
ruling.

So he lets the matter drop.
But if the rule is that a truthful but unresponsive

answer constitutes perjury, then every time the questioner
leaves the unresponsive answer on the question, you have a
prima facie case of perjury.
Now, that is the most disturbing aspect of this
entire case.
QUESTIONs And yet, certainly, if it were a civil
fraud action, this type of answer would support a judgment
for civil fraud.
MR. ELSENs

I would not concede that, Mr. Justice

22

Rehnquist, but I would draw this distinction, and the ALX
draws this:

In a civil fraud action, the actor, the person

making the statement, controls the framing of the representa­
tions.
If I’m selling you stock, and I give you a
prospectus, you cannot ask me the next question.
QUESTION?

No, but if I'm interrogating you orally

about what kind of a stock it is, I certainly do ask the
question,
MR. ELSEN: Well, the normal civil fraud situation
arises out of representations where the actor controls the
representations,

And the American Law Institute, in the
.

i

Model Penal Code, does sayv that there should be a stricter
standard for that type of situation than for the interrogation
situation where counsel is in a position to frame the issues,
to ask the next question, and to pursue.
And I would say, though I certainly do not say that
this is a fraud, particularly in the light of the nature of
the questioning here and the nature of the economic interests
that were involved here, where there was indeed no motive,
that if we assume all those things that I have assumed to
reach this point in the discussion, nevertheless, a truthful
but unresponsive answer put so broadly that it would — a rule
of this sort would either be unenforced, thus inviting
disrespect for the law, or it would be enforced most frequently

23

against those in disfavor.
Now, the Model Penal Code deals with an analogous

*

issue, it is not an identical issue, but it raises the same
policy problem, in its treatment of the Remington type
problem, the problem arising from United States vs. Remington,
where the ALT says ;
"The likelihood of achieving moral reformation by
imprisoning one who has, objectively, told the truth is not
high.

Encouraging the police to inquire as to subjective

dishonesty behind the objective truth would not only waste their
time, but opens substantial possibility of abuse,"
Now, I see ■— I would like to reserve the balance
of my time for rebuttal? but I would like to simply make one
point -—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Well, you have only two
minutes of it left, so you'd better make that judgment.
MR, ELSEN: Well, then I will simply say this;

This

is not a case involving material omissions, either, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist.

We do not have to reach that point.
Now, at 124 to 5 of the Model Penal Code comments,

the ALI advocates a very restrictive rule on perjury in the
interrogation situation, and that's what the government purports
to answer in its brief.

It deals with the question of material

omission.
But here we have a situation where the questioner

24
does not get an answer that purports to be complete, like
"Who was at the meeting?

Jones and Smith, or Jones and

Robinson."
The question is like the analogy given in our brief,
"Jones and Robinson were the only black men at the meeting."
The question is, if you want to know who every one else was,
"Who were the white men at the meeting?"
It's only to a class of those within the general
question. The questioner is not put off, and he should ask
the next question.
If you reach the question of material omissions,
I do submit that in interrogation the issue is different than
in fraud, but we need not reach that.

That I think is

important.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well.
Mr. Frey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The central issue in this case is whether a witness
who, knowingly, wilfully, and with the intent to deceive and
conceal, gives sworn testimony which, considered in the
context in which it was given, constitutes a falsehood by
implication, can escape punishment for perjury on the ground

25

that the words that he uttered were literally or technically
truthful,- when considered in isolation.
Now, I’d like to begin with what the jury necessarily
found when it convicted petitioner in this case.
Judge Tenney's charge to the jury was, we believe,
a model of clarity and of precision, and we have set forth
the relevant portions of it in Appendix B to our brief.

Judge

Tenney made it quite clear to the jury that they had to find
beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner understood the
question, that his response to the question was not inaccurate
as a result of haste, inadvertence, misunderstanding,
confusion, negligence, or any honest error on his part,
QUESTIONS Would you say, Mr, Frey, that the majority
of the Second Circuit in this case read this answer to Question
No, 2 as though he had said, "No, but my company did"?
MR, FREY:

Yes,

I think that this •—

QUESTION:

You have to read that "no" into it,

MR, FREY:

Well, I think that's true.

don't you?
Now, we don’t

have t.o read that in as a matter of law, because this is an
issue, as I am trying to point out here, the jury did resolve,
QUESTION:

Well, the Second Circuit is treating the

answer given as though; do you agree that that's the way they
are treating it?
MR, FREY;

Yes, I do agree, Your Honor,

When
QUESTIONs

You say that's the necessary implication,

the inevitable implication?
MR. FREY:

That's what the jury found, because the

judge instructed them, apart from the question of understanding,
that they must find that he made a statement which, when
considered in the entire context, was a false statement.

And

he further instructed that they must find beyond a reasonable
doubt that he made the statement with an intent to deceive.
So that when the jury convicted petitioner, the
jury necessarily found that he understood the question, and
they necessarily found that his statement "The company had an
account in Zurich for about six months" was of the same
effect and had the same meaning, in the context, as if he had
said "The company had an account in Zurich for about six months,
and there were no other accounts.”
That's what the jury found.
QUESTION:

Well, that's not really a final

answer, is it?
MR. FREY:

Well, there is a question, of course, as

to whether the jury could properly find that, under the —■
QUESTION: That's right, —
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

-- under the evidence in this case.
— juries find lots of things: lots of

jury verdicts are upset, aren't they?

27

MR. FREY:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION : Even though the instructions are proper?
HR. FREY:

That may be true, if there's an error

QUESTION:

Well, it is true, isn't it?

MR. FREY:

Yes.

in —

the case to the jury.

If there's an error in submitting

We don't believe there was such an error

in this case.
Basically, petitioner's arguments fall into two
categories.

The one group of arguments are those that say the

case should never have gone to the jury.

The second group are

those that say all of this may be true, what the jury found
may be true; it may be true that this was a lie by negative
implication.

But that's not enough as a matter of law, and

the judge was in error when he charged the technical truthful­
ness is not sufficient.
I'd like to take up first the ambiguity point that
Mr. Elsen discussed, which is basically a question of whether
it was propar to submit this issue to the jury.
Now, I point out that in addition to the jury none
¥

of the judges below had the least difficulty with this
contention. They were all satisfied that the word ''you" as
used in the context of these questions at least called for
information about the petitioner's personal accounts.
Now, in our view, looking at the context of the

28

proceeding,, it was logical to assume that it called for
information about both personal and corporate accounts.

But,

in any event, x^e do not believe that it can be construed as
calling for information only about his corporate accounts.
I think perhaps I can illustrate that point for you
by a hypothetical.

Suppose the company had had no accounts

in Switzerland at any time? there had been only petitioner's
personal account.

And he had been asked these very questions

that he x\*as asked, and in response to the question "Have you
ever had a Swiss bank account?" he had simply answered no.
Now, I don't think it can seriously be contended
that that response would have been nonperjurious in view of the
existence of his personal Geneva account.
Yet, if the ambiguity argument, as a matter of law,
holds water, then that response —- the question was still
ambiguous and you couldn't go to the jury even if he had said
no in those circximstances.
Now, I think if you look at the context of this
proceeding and of the questions, there was evidence from which
the jury could reasonably infer that the word "you" referred
to petitioner’s personal accounts.
First of all there is the wording of the question
itself, the normal meaning of those questions, it seems to me,
is that "you" is "you, Mr. Bronston".
Now, petitioner says;

Well, but this was a

29
bankruptcy arrangement proceeding for Mr. Bronston's wholly
owned corporation.
That’s true.

However, the nature of this proceeding

is one in which the creditors are trying to discover and
marshal the assets of the company in order to be sure that the
creditors' claims are going to be satisfied, that there has
been no improper diversion of company assets into friends’
or into the personal hands of the sole owner of the company.
So it’s highly material.

It’s not just material as

a technical matter, but it’s highly material to the bankruptcyinquiry to determine petitioner's individual finances, to see
whether there is money that is in his personal possession
which properly belongs to the corporation and should be
reachable by the creditors as part of the arrangement.
Now, the evidence in this case, the account had been
closed and it has never been established that there was
bankruptcy fraud by petitioner.

However, in the setting of

this situation, I think it's quite clear that the questions
were addressed to his personal account.
Now, one other point in this connection, —
QUESTION:

At tht point, Mr. Frey, what could he

possibly have gained by the type of answer he gave, if it
were perjurious?
MR. FREYs Well, first of all, he deflected inquiry
into this account through which $180,000 had passed, which he

30

used for mixed business and personal purposes according to
the testimony at the trial in the perjury case.

I can't tell

you what, specifically, he would have gained.
What I can tell you is that it’s possible that
either there were or he thought there were some improprieties
in that personal account which would have, been revealed —
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, Mr. Frey, that certainly

this bankruptcy estate suffered none at all by anything that
he said.
MR. FREY: Well,it hasn’t been proved

that he

suffered by it. The fact is that no inquiry was made into the
Geneva account.

Had he mentioned the Geneva account, I

think it's quite clear that an investigation of that —
QUESTION: Well, I thought all of the facts
regarding those accounts,

what vjas in them,how long they'd

been open, when they were

closed, that they all were finally

developed at the perjury trial.

Am I wrong about that?

Both the corporate and personal accounts.
MR. FREY: Well,the personal account ledger was
introduced, and there was evidence regarding seme of the
transactions, there was some evidence that the government
sought to introduce regarding an unexplained series of
transactions involving a $25,000 payment from the company to
a Liechtenstein corporation called the Dorchester Establish­
ment, which, five weeks after, paid $20,000 into this personal

31

Geneva account.

Now, that evidence was introduced and was

before the jury when Mr. Elsen sought to rebut that evidence
by putting in explanatory evidence. There was a conference
at the bench, as a result of which the matter was dropped and
the government did not argue to the jury.
And I can't say to you that there was any
impropriety in this transaction.

But what I can say is that

it's very possible that Mr. Bronston thought there was
something about that account that he didn't want to have
these people snooping into.

It was a substantial account;

$180,000.
Even though it was closed now, assets can be
traced from account to account.
Now, we will agree that there are circumstances in
which a question can be so ambiguous that as a matter of law
you can't ask the jury to find whether the defendant under­
stood the question.

An example of that would be the Lattimore

case, where he was asked if he was a follower of the
Communist line, and in reversing his perjury conviction it
was stated — properly, I believe — that the jury shouldn't
be allowed to speculate on what such a vague term may mean.
In the Cobert case, he was asked about a "listing
post", and the indictment didn't indicate what a listing
post was, or that he had an understanding of what a listing
post was

32

We don't have that kind of a problem here.

Every™

body knows what a bank account is, and I think we know what
“you" is.

It’s not — it doesn’t suffer from that kind of

ambiguity.
Finally, a point that I think you brought out
earlier, Mr, Justice White;
completely theoretical.
matter of law.

Petitioner’s argument is

He’s saying this is ambiguous as a

He never got up on the stand and said, "I

didn't understand the question.”

At no point has he

introduced evidence to that effect.

We’re dealing with —

QUESTION; But part of his argument, I take it, is
that even if the witness clearly understood it, all he did
was fence with the lawyer.
MR. FREY; Well, —
QUESTION;

In the sense that a lot of witnesses

just naturally fence with lawyers? they don't know where the
lawyer is going with questions — all the questions that they
can avoid answering, they try to avoid answering.
And so he said, "Well, my mother had an account" or
"my company did"? he just didn't answer the question.
MR. FREY; Well, —
QUESTION: And your argument has to be that any time
that somebody gives an evasive answer, a jury is entitled to
find that the negative implication was that he really
intended to answer the question falsely.

33

MR. FREYt
that, at all.

Ho, I don't believe my argument has to be

I'll turn to that point now.

QUESTION;

Well, it does if you — any time the jury

found it, you would sustain it.
MR. FREY;

No, I would not.

Let's take Judge

Lumbard's example in his dissenting opinion.

He says:

Suppose petitioner had answered the question by saying, "My
daughter went to school in Switzerland"?
is an unresponsive answer.

Well, he says, this

He says, it's very similar to the

answer he gave, at least he just changed — the difference is
a matter of degree.
QUESTION;

Yes, but if it went to the jury and the

jury found it, what would you say?
MR. FREY:
jury in tht case.

No, I would say it could not go to the
And the reason it could not go to the jury

is that the answer, "My daughter went to school in Switzer­
land", does not contain any implication about bank accounts,
one way or another.

It cannot be uderstood to be a denial

of the existence of any bank accounts.
But the answer, "The company had an account in
Zurich, for about six months" can be understood, and the jury
took it to mean that was the only account,there were no other
accounts.
And our case does depend upon that implication, that
we say the jury could properly find was inherent in his

34

answer.

But not just any unresponsive answer.would expose

the witness to perjury.
QUESTION?

But the essence of what you've

responded to there suggests that you can be found guilty of
the criminal act of perjury by implication.
MR. FREY:

Yes, indeed.

By

if your statement

contains with it an implication, as many statements do, the
question is:

what did you intend to convey, and what did you

convey?
The question is:

should we look just at the literal

words, should we parse them as narrowly as possible, or should
we look at the meaning?

May the jury say, "Yes, in this

context, we find that when he said these words he meant to
deny the existence of the Geneva account."

Because that is

what they found.
And we say that if that's the meaning, even though
the meaning is not part of the literal, technical parsing of
his dry words, he still can be held accountable for that
misstatement.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I don't know that it makes

any difference, but were these questions asked by the
referee in bankruptcy or by counsel for one of the claimants?
MR. FREY:

They were asked by counsel for one of

the principal creditors of the corporation.
Nov/, we believe that the position that petitioner

35

has taken is directly contrary to the basic purpose of the
perjury statute, which has as its central concern protecting
the integrity of the fact-finding process.
They dismiss, and Judge Lumbard dismisses the factor
t hat the inquiry is frustrated and misled as being not
material? but we think that it’s the very evil at which the
perjury statute is really aimed.
Now, ~
QUESTION?

Yes, but that excuses pretty easily the

failure to — not to ask another question.
MR. FREY? Well, it’s easy for us to stand here now,
knowing about the existence of the Geneva account, and looking
back on the matter —■
QUESTION?

But normally since he didn’t

you don’t

have to know that to wonder why the lawyer didn't ask another
question at the time.
MR. FREY? Well, because I think the lawyer understood
petitioner’s answer the way the jury understood petitioner's
answer, to deny the Geneva account? and therefore it was
fruitless to ask another question.

He already had the

information he was seeking.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Frey, I think to most everybody
who has practiced law your first reaction to that set of
questions is, you know, if you had been the examining attorney
and gotten an answer like this, you would have said, "Yes, but

36

how about your own account?"
I don't think you have to know the existence of the
Geneva account to feel that the answer is almost a red flag to
any lawyer who is paying attention to the examination.
MR. FREY;

Well, I don't believe that's so. We're

dealing here with a very experienced and capable New York
lawyer who did not ask the next question.

Now, I can't say

why he didn't ask the next question, but it does seem to me
that he had an answer which seemed to answer his question in
its entirety.
That is, the answer, "The company had an account in
Zurich for about six months" suggests that that was the only
Swiss bank account that existed.
QUESTION;

In bankruptcy cases when there's some

thought perjury has occurred, who makes the decision to
prosecute?
MR. FREY;

I think the United States Attorney would

make this decision.
QUESTION; This isn't something that would have to
come to the Department of Justice?
MR, FREY;

I'm not certain of that; I'm not

certain.
In this case, I believe the information was
provided by the creditor whose attorney had been asking the
questions to the United States Attorney.

37

QUESTION;

Isn’t it also true that in a bankruptcy

hearing it’s a complete fishing expedition, you can ask anything
you want to ask?
MR. FREYs

That is true.

In fact, the —

QUESTION:

And that’s in the light of this lawyer

who could have asked any question following this up; couldn't
he?
MR. FREY: Well, but this wasn't just any line of
questioning, Mr. Justice Marshall.

This was questioning which

was going to something which was —
QUESTION: But I'm saying there are no restrictions
at all on the lawyer getting the facts, if he knew how to get
them?
MR. FREY:

Oh, that's true.

He could certainly have

asked — he could have repeated the question with different
wording.

He could have said:

"Yes.

What about your personal

accounts, did you have any of those?"
He could have done that; there's no question.
The questioning that immediately preceded the Swiss
bank account questioning concerned Mrs. Bronston's jewelry,
truly a personal matter, and immediately following that into
the Swiss bank account questioning.
Now, we think that while the policies are not the
same where you're dealing with criminal fraud or extortion,
there is a general principle of American jurisprudence that

38
you look at statements in the context in which they're uttered,
you give, them the meaning that the context sugqests that they
convey.

You don't look at them strictly in terms of the

literal words.
We think the same policy ought to apply in the
perjury area as applies in civil areas and in other areas of
criminal utterance.
QUESTION: Well, that would be very persuasive to me
if this were a verdict in a civil case, as Justice Rehnquist
suggested, a verdict in a civil case for fraud, and the jury
then returned a verdict treating this as a fraudulent answer,
a dishonest answer.

Don't you have a different standard

when you're dealing with the perjury case.
MR. FREY: Well, I think if this were a criminal
fraud case it would also be true that you would look at the
context of the statement, and we have cited cases in our
brief to that effect.
It's true that —
QUESTION:

Well, I was putting it another way, that

I think an appellate court would have very little difficulty
affirming a judgment in a civil fraud case with this
structure of questions and answers,

But that doesn't carry

you all the way in a criminal case, does it?
MR. FREY:

No, I'm not suggesting that automatically

the same policy would apply to perjury. There are different

39

considerations.

But I am saying that what the dissent in the

Court of Appeals proposed was that we simply look at the
words in isolation from the context in which they were spoken.
If those words are literally true, the inquiry is at an end.
Now, I'd like to touch briefly on the hypothetical
which we in our brief and petitioner in his reply brief have
brought out.
I think that one can readily see that literal
truthfulness should not be a total defense to a perjury charge.
From the example of the question, "Who was at the meeting of
June 1?" and the response, "Smith and Brown."

When, in fact,

Jones and Robinson were also at the meeting.
Now, the response, "Smith and Brown" is literally
truthful.

You could of course ask another questions

"Anyone

else?"
But the response, "Smith and Brown" in the context
can suggest that that's a total answer,
QUESTION?

Well, you could start out with a good

question in the first place:

"Name everybody who was at the

meeting,"
MR. FREYs

Well, you could do that, that's right,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I think that — I would concede that
the inquiry here was not the most skillful that one can imagine,
but the question is whether the witness, who has spoken
falsely, should be relieved of the onus of his offense by

40

virtue of the ineptitude of counsel who asked him the
question.
This witness understood what the question called for.
I

He gave an answer which was designed to, and which did, convey
false information, denying the existence of the Swiss bank
account.
QUESTION;

Well, I get what you say, but it may be

quite true that he thoroughly intended to conceal the fact that
was asked; you wouldn't say that's equivalent to — if he
successfully conceals it, is that equivalent to perjury?
MR. FREY; Well, it depends on how he does it, of
course, and only if he conceals it by a false statement would
it be perjury.

But our contention is that that is what he did

here.
He could simply have answered the question “Yes";
I mean, that would have been a completely satisfactory and non­
par jurious answer and would have put the ball back in the court
of the person asking the questions.
Instead, he chose to answer in a manner which
implied the non-existence of this personal Geneva account.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose part of the problem is

that on the day that the creditor's counsel was asking these
questions he wasn't thinking about a perjury case in federal
district court, a criminal prosecution.
we must think about it

Now we're here, and

41
MR. PREY;

You say petitioner wasn't thinking about

QUESTION:

No, no, I said the creditor's counsel.

MR. PREY;

That's probably true, he wasn't, —

QUESTION:

The creditor's counsel was just making a

it, or .

general inquiry, he wasn't undertaking to cast his questions
in the precision of a criminal prosecution,
MR. FREY;

Oh, that's true, but here he was dealing

with a witness who had come in as, in effect, a plaintiff
asking relief of the court for his corporation, asking the
bankruptcy court and asking his creditors to participate in
an arrangement.

He was dealing with a witness who had unique

possession of the information that was necessary to be
developed for the sake of assuring that the arrangement that
would be arrived at would be fair to the creditors.
The lawyer, since this was a discovery type of
proceeding, he didn't already have this information, he didn't
know the answers, he didn't know about the existence of any
Swiss bank accounts, one way or the other.
information that Mr. Bronston knew of.

This was

And Mr. Bronston was

therefore in a position where he could, much more easily,
mislead the inquiry than you would be at a trial where, of
course, in many cases the lawyers already know the information
and their problem is to bring it, develop it for the fact­
finder

42
Here you have a discovery proceeding, and the Court
of Appeals, in their opinion, emphasized the particular
importance.
It would also be important in grand jury proceedings,
which are discovery proceedings in the criminal area? a witness
is to be free to give any kind of answer so long as it's
literally truthful, no matter how misleading it is, no matter
what implications it carries, no matter to what extent it
deflects the grand jury's inquiry.
QUESTION;

Well, they may not be free to do that,

but that doesn't mean they're guilty of perjury every time
they do it.

They may not be free to do it in the sense that

the lawyer can ask him another question, and if they refuse to
answer they will go to jail.
MR. FREY:

If the lawyer sees that he's been —

that he is or may have been lied to.
QUESTION:

But it's —

Well, it wouldn't take much in this

case, would it?
MR. FREY: Well, I think that *— again I have to come
back to what I think the — what the jury found petitioner's
statement to mean, which was that he had already denied the
existence of this account.
QUESTION:

I mean, in my example of --

Well, I agree the jury must have found

that, that he intended to tell a lie.
MR. FREY:

In my example with the persons at the

43

meeting, where the answer is "Smith and Brown”, and which I
believe the petitioner concedes is perjurious in that context,
although I think Judge Lumbard would not find it to be; you
would agree that all you have to do is ask "Anyone else?" and
you could bring out the rest of that information.

Yet the

answer suggests no one else, and if the answer stands, no
one else is the answer to which the witness is held.
Now, the difference in the example that petitioner
has used in his reply brief, as he says, that the answer had
been "Smith and Jones were the blacks at the meeting”, that
would not be perjurious.
We agree.

That would not be perjurious.

The

example is inapt, however, for the reason that the statement
"Smith and Jones were the blacks at the meeting" carries with
it no implication denying the presence of other persons at
the meeting.

On the contrary, it implies that there were other

people at the meeting.
Now, if this answer had implied that there were
other bank accounts, we wouldn’t be here today, because we
would agree that there would be no perjury charge to submit
to the jury.
If this answer had been completely unresponsive,
like the daughter going to school in Switzerland, there would
be no negative implication, no false statement contained.
Now, there is one matter that I would like to call

44
to the Court's attention that’s come to our attention in the
course of preparing for the argument.

The opinion of the

Second Circuit speaks about the whole-truth principle of the
oath, and in a footnote they state;

"It may be deduced from

these orders and forms and the purpose of the Act that an
oath given in a bankruptcy proceeding basically takes the
same form, and has the same legal consequences, as an oath
composed of the traditional words of ’truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth’."
QUESTION;

What page is that on?

MR. PREY;

That is in the cert petition at

Appendix page A8, footnote 4,
QUESTION; Thank you.
MR. PREY;

I have been advised by Referee Ryan that

the form of oath that he uses is an oath as follows;
"Do you swear that the evidence that you shall give in this
proceeding shall be the truth, so help you, God?"
Now, therefore, the Court was wrong in surmising
that the — in form the oath contained an explicit reference
to the wholte-truth principle.

In our view, however, this

makes no difference, when a witness takes his oath to tell
the truth he’s bound to tell the truth, and we say that Mr,
Bronstcn didn't do it.
In closing, it's our contention that petitioner’s
position would constitute an open invitation to the clever

45
witness seeking to conceal the truth, to engage in half-true,
evasive and deceptive answers.

In short, to subvert the

integrity of the fact-finding process with impugnity so long
as he can be literally or technically truthful.
The principle that the Court lays down in this case
will not apply solely to bankruptcy proceedings, because we’re
engaged in an interpretation of the federal perjury statute,
A reversal of petitioner's conviction would suggest that the
same sort of deceit and falsehood by negative implication that
would go unpunished here could be resorted to by a witness in
a criminal case, x^here a man's liberty may be at stake.
We don't believe it's too much for the sake of the
integrity of the federal fact-finding process to requi_e
witnesses to be truthful, not just in the narrow, technical
sense of the literal meaning of their words, but in the
broader sense of the true meaning of the words in the context
in which they're uttered.
Accordingly, we submit the conviction should be
affirmed.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Frey.

Thank you, Mr, Elsen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at llsOl o'clock, a.m., the case was
submitted.]
