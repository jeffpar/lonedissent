ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEON JAWORSKI, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. JAWORSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As was true in the case argued just before tills
one, the Attorney General of Texas, the Honorable John Hill,
has participated in the preparation of this appeal as has
his staff with us.

And, in order to avoid the dividing of

arguments, he has asked that I present the argument on
behalf of the state.
I think that perhaps a more accurate description
of What this case really involves could hardly be made than
the characterissation given it by the dissenting judge who
stated that this was an instance of the majority entering
fields of purely state and local management.
Under the provisions of Article III, Section 28, of
the Constitution of Texas, a legislative redistricting
board is assembled if the legislature fails to redistrict
the state after its first regular session following the
publication of each United States decennial census.

So, the

4
legislature convened in January, 1971 was under constitu­
tional mandate to provide this re-districting,
Texas has a bicameral legislature.

And because the

legislature had failed to redistrict both houses, of course
any effort at redistricting failed

and, as a consequence,

the redistricting board was assembled and considered the
matter of providing a plan of redistricting the Senate and
also a plan of redistricting the Lower House,
This board is constituted by several •elected state
officials serving on it.

It is the lieutenant governor,

the spealcer of the house, the attorney general, the
comptroller of public accounts, and the commissioner of the
general land office.

Three or more of those members of the

redistricting board may sign whatever plan they agree upon,
and it is certified to the secretary of state, and then it
becomes an effective plan.
I might say that the House plan is the only one,
the plan relating to the representatives, is the only

plan

that is involved on this appeal.
Perhaps brief reference should be made to the
commencement of this litigation.

After the plans were filed,

a suit was instituted in Houston, Texas by Curtis Graves,
a black state representative from Harris County—that is
Houston—in which he contended that there was unconstitu­
tional apportionment of the senatorial districts because of

5

,

an alleged racial gerrymandering

his point being that there

should have been a district carved out in which GO percent
are blacks and that because one was not carved out in that
manner, it was unconstitutional.
And then next came a number of other suits that
were filed, challenging the board’s plan for the House of
Representatives in different parts of the state with
different groups filing these suits, and interventions were
also filed on behalf of a number of groups.

And there was

a consolidation of all of these actions, and they were
heard before a three-judge court.
The court ordered first that, unless the
legislature of Texas on or before July 1, 1973 adopted a
plan to reapportion the legislative districts in accordance
with the constitutional guidelines set out in the court's
opinion, that the court will then proceed to reapportion the
state itself.
county

And then the court further ordered that the

of Dallas—that is where the City of Dallas is—and

the County of Bexar—that is where San Antonio is—that
both of these b© reapportioned into single-member
representative districts in conformance with a plan of
reapportionment that the court provided.
Q

Mr. Jaworski, was injunctive relief granted?

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes„ sir.

The injunctive relief

consisted of the state being restrained from proceeding.

The

elections could not be held in accordance with the plan that
had been filed by the redistricting board»
Judge Wood stated very frankly that he whole­
heartedly disagreed with his colleagues in declaring the
State plan unconstitutional, saying that he could think of
nothing that illustrated more vividly the chaos that existed
in the area of restructuring the political districts of a
state as was attempted to be done and ordered by the court
in this particular instance, to be done by July 1, 1973 or
else the court’s plan had to b© adopted.
Of course, the Mahan v. Howell case is very
significant.

A number of the Court’s pronouncements in that

case are quite applicable here.

Perhaps I should point out

that what the majority did in our case was rely on the
Kirkpatrick v. Preisler case, repeatedly referring to it;
also on Wells v. Rockerfeller, both of which, as we know,
are congressional redistricting cases.
Q

Mr. Jaworski, a great deal more flexibility

is permitted in state legislature than in congressional
districts?
MR. JAWORSKI:

That is what this Court, of course,

said in the Mahan v„ Howell case.
Q

It was said before that.

MR. JAWORSKIj
Reynolds v. Sims—

And also said it—yes, sir—in the

?
Q

Reynolds against Sims.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Right, sir.

But it was quite

well emphasized in the case that was decided or rather was
handed down last week.
Q
in tha

So, there is nothing new in Mahan v. llowoll

respect.
MR. JAWORSKX:

No, 2 do not think so.

I think it

did some re-emphasizing that perhaps—and having come so
recently—is something that we might talk about a little
more, 2 mean as counsel.

But certainly there was nothing

new in it.
The interesting thing is that Judge Wood who so
strongly dissented in this case from the actual majority
recognized that difference in his dissenting opinion, and
he recognized a difference between congressional districts
and legislative districts, pointing to the cases, pointing
t° Reynolds v. Simfi.
What the majority did here was require, first, a
much stricter standard of state legislative reapportionmenfc,
permissible deviation, than had been approved heretofore.
Actually, in this case the total variation of 9.9 percent
under the board v?as unquestioned as far as the majority
opinion was concerned.
I noticed where in one of the briefs some question
was raised whether that might be entirely accurate, but there
*

8
had been nothing before the lower court that raised any
question beyond that of it being assumed and consider©#
that the total variation was only 9.9 percent.

This was.

under the board4s rsdistricting plan.
I should point out that actually the average
variation was only 1,82 percent.
One of the problems in this case, a matter on
which so very ranch stress was laid by a majority of the
court 'which, in our view, led the court exactly to nothing
as far as the end result was concerned, were -the procedural
niceties that were followed by this board.
There were several things that took place.

Of

course, these man, all of them, had to depend upon staff
assistants because they had other duties to perform as state
officials, and they did have considerable staff assistance.
Perhaps the one official who participated more than anyone
else in this particular matter was the attorney general
himself who counseled with the redistricting board
constantly on what should be done and also letting them know
on what was permissibly legal as he interpreted the
decisions.
But the court has gone to considerable extent in
talking about not the end result so much as these procedures
that were employed and finding fault with them and finding
fault with the particular assistance that had been rendered

9

by members of the staff and such as that, forgetting, it
seemed to me, at least for a moment that even judges need
the assistance or at least utilize the assistance of law
clerks at times.

But that, also it is very clear there was

a complete misapprehension of what Whitcomb v, Chavis
actually said.
What the court here did wa3 not only, as indicated,
went into the matter of redistricting the entire state but
also found fault with what had been dona speeifical3.y
insofar as single- and multi-member districts were concerned
in the two counties that cure mentioned.
What the court failed to do, as we see it, was to
employ the Equal Protection test, that a state must make
an honest and a good faith effort to construct the districts
as nearly of equal population as is practicable.

And there

is nothing here to indicate in this record that this good
faith effort was not made.
Let me digress for a moment, if X may, because X
have noticed that there were some references made in some of
the briefs to some alleged evidence in this case that
frankly is no evidence.

What happened at the outset was that

the chief judge of this three-judge court, the presiding
judge, announced that everything that was offered by anyone
would be admitted into evidence.
make any objections.

He did not want us to even

If the matter was conjectural, if it

10

was hearsay or whatever the proper objection may have beenf
it went into the record anyway, the announcement being that
the court would at the end consider those things that were
admissible and those matters that were not admissible.
there were no rulings that were made by the court.

But

And, as

a consequence, the floodgates were opened and everybody who
had anything that he wanted to bring before the court, just
introduced it into evidence and it was received.
We do not know actually what the court did
consider and what it did not consider, speaking of the
majority.

But we do know that there were soma matters

tendered here that were not admissible into evidence and
that the record presently is cluttered v/ith some of those
matters.
I mention that simply because what should really
be a relatively easy case to discuss with the Court and the
issues being well defined, as we see it, is complicated a
little because of seme of the references that have been
made in some of the briefs to what the evidence purportedly
showed.
The court, the majority, apparently everywhere
jU3t placed the burden upon the state to show' that there was
no inequality of any kind, that there was no discrimination
of any kind, that there was not any type of dilution, and
had us carry the burden throughout the case.

So far as I can

11
tall, we discharged the burden, although it is questionable
as to whether we had the burden in all of these instances.
Texas is a large state, as is known.
engage in talking about how large it is.

We will not

But it is not only

a large one but. it also has a shape, and it does not render
it very easily susceptible to the division among districts.
So, some problem is going to be encountered.

What was

necessary here were—well, let me say first the ideal
district was about 74,000—74,000 plus.

There were ISO

representatives to be elected to the Lower House, and a
large number of districts had to be carved out.
In addition to it, this particular board was
confronted first, with a provision of the constitution of our
state which had been interpreted in the case of Craddlck v.
Smith, which we cite in our brief.

And under that, county

lines could not be crossed unless it were absolutely
necessary to do it in order to make up this district of
74,000, the ideal.
It also required that it go to a contiguous county
if it were necessary to do that.
Texas, as v;e know and as the Court doubtless knows,
not only has its large metropolitan cities, but it has rural
areas.

It has large areas that are very sparsely settled.

Actually there was no instance in which our constitutional
requirements and the integrity that was required for this

12
board to follow was not. carefully embraced in each instance
with the possible exception—-we 11, with the exception—-of
Red River County, and there we had a real problem up in the
part that adjoins Arkansas with the Red River and between
the two of them had a problem as to Bowie County.

So, what

was actually done is that in that one instance the county
line was crossed.
The total population, incidentally, as the Court
probably has already gathered from what 1 had said is,
according to the last census, about 11,200,000.
The senatorial district is not involved here but
may be of interest to the Court, is of approximately
360,000 to 368,000.
If we were to draw comparisons here—-and I do this
only because the case has just been decided by this Court
and to show the similarity of the situations.

If I may

review those in Virginia, there was a total variation of
16.4; under what the board did here, a total variation of
9„9; and an average variation in the Mahan case of 3.89?
and Texas of 1.82.
Within the four percent, there were 35 of the
districts in Virginia.
plan.

In. Texas we had 93 under this board’s

Those that exceeded six percent ware nine in Virginia.

There were none under this board's plan in Texas.
two exceeded five percent.

And only

13
I indicated a few moments ago. that it was our
view that Whitcomb y, C hay is had been misinterpreted.

And

we do feel that that is definitely in the case.
I want to mention one effort that was made in
particular.

There was injected in the case the fact that

perhaps one difference was that in Indiana, particularly in
Marion County, which was involved in the Whitcomb v. Chavis
case, that there was no racial history.
was made that Texas had a racial history.

And a suggestion
There is no one

that would deny that Texas, as is true with some many of the
states, has a racial legacy.

It is untrue that there is

any showing whatever that there has been any such happenings
any sort of racial violation, with respect to the electoral
process in our state.

The last one, according to the

testimony in this case, undisputed and coming from a witness
who appeared on behalf of the appellees, was bach in 1956.
So that this is really not in the case, despite
the fact the witness was put on the stand to testify or
undertake to testify—'and this is one of the particular
matters to Which I refer that has made it somewhat difficult
to brief and argue this case because the court admitted
everything—*-a man who posod as an expert and undertook to
say that there was a difference as far as racial history
in Indianapolis and Marion County was concerned and in Texas
And then it turned out, when I asked him the questions on

14
cross-examination, that he had never even been to Indiana,
much less Indianapolis, had not made any type of study or
the matter, and. this is set out in our brief to show what
we had to contend with,
I should say that there is a stipulation in the
record in order to lay at rest completely the matter of all
having been free to engage a process of registration as?
well as voting.

There is a stipulation that there has been

none of that in our state for a number of years ,■ and of
course the evidence shows nothing of the kind.
Now we get into another phase that X want to
discuss with the Court, if I may, and that is what happened
with respect to Harris County, Houston.

Under the board’s

plan, being divided into single-member districts, and
what happened insofar as Dallas—that is, Dallas County—
and San Antonio, Bexar County, being multi-member districts.
There, of course, is some difference, one could
say.

Houston, a very large city, 1,700,000, either fifth

or sixth largest city in the nation at the present time?
Dallas, a million three, Dallas County; San Antonio, even
a much smaller city than that.
had multi-member districts.
County.

Traditionally Dallas has

The same is true of Bexar

As far as Houston is concerned, Harris County, the

legislators themselves, the delegation from there,more or
less favored single-member districts.

So

t

on the surface you might say, "Well, why does

Harris County have single-member districts and why dees
Dallas and Bexar Counties have multi-member districts?"
It really was done without there being the slightest
intimation in the record that any individual group
sacrificed any constitutional rights by virtue of it.

It

was done largely because the board had before it witnesses
who thought that this was a sensible thing to do, and
Harris County had
.

witnesses before it that thought it was

a sensible thing to do in Dallas and Eexar County, what
was done in those.
Cur position is that absent the showing of something
that shows that either voting strength has been diluted or
that something has been done that has occasioned the
transgression of a constitutional right, that certainly
much has been made of nothing.

I said what really brought it on more than

The record shows that

if they undertook to exercise the election process, their
right to. vote, to register and vote, there would not be any
problem.

The problem has been that less than 30 percent of

them, or approximately 30 percent of them,, seek to exercise
that privilege.

This is where your trouble has been as far

as Bexar County is concerned.
I should make mention of this too, because it is
in the record and a matter that probably will be talked
about.

Dallas County has a strong political party.

It is

a party that has had on its slate blacks as well as whites.
The record shows that they were contemplating three blacks
on their slate following this act of redistricting.
Actually, they have had at different levels,
that is, even including the legislative level, blacks on the
slate before.
It is true that it is a strong political
organization.

It is true that a black placed on that slate

probably would be elected.

It is also true that a white

placed on that slate would be elected.

It is also true that

if this organization opposed the white, that he would have a

That means in order to obtain the nomination

you must, if you are a black candidate, ultimate be pitted
vis-a-vis a white candidate in a county in which racial
segregation, discrimination, has still been the order of the
day.

Granted it diminishes, but as this record establishes,

it diminishes rather slowly.
And what this record further shows is that the
dominant political organisation of that county, the DCRG,
when circumstances require and their candidates are
threatened by a black candidate or by a candidate that has
the support of the Negro minority, they simply trot out the
old game of race in order to win.

In 1970 two candidates

made it into the runoff, Democratic primary runoff, against
the DCRG candidates, the DCRG being a private sort of
modern day jay bird association, as far as we are concerned.
In that runoff, the DCRG mailed to some white
voters of Dallas County literature saying, "Block voting
tactics will take place in the South Dallas'*—-the Negro

area of Dallas."if you don’t, get out to the poll:" and
vote.**

And it said, "The philosophy of these candidates is

Q

Let us assume for the moment that the

validity of the entire state plan is here, assuming they
have jurisdiction of the issue; the district court upset
the entire plan, based on three things.
MR. RICHARDS:
Q

One, variation—

Just straight deviation,

Did that variation on the numbers reach
*

Harris, Dallas, and Bexar Counties?

What if the multi-member

district issue had not been here?
MR. RICHARDS;

The deviation of the two major

districts, Harris and Bexar, was not central to the court's
decision on deviation, if I make myself clear.

The way th®

deviation was calculated in those two. counties was simply
dividing the number of legislators—

26

Q

Some parts of the plan were invalidated

solely on deviation-MR. RICHARDSi

Some parts were but not those parts

dealing with the multi-member, single-member district issue.
Some parts of the plan, I do not think it is purely
deviational.

1 think, if I read the court’s opinion

correctly, what we have is the state sponsoring an
explanation, a county line explanation as being the
justification for deviation.

But once you go behind that

explanation and look to plan, you think it just does not
make sense.
Q

1 understand.

But on the multi-member

district rationale, that was because Harris was divided
and the other metropolitan areas were not?
MR. RICHARDS;

Yes, in part.

There are two

strings to that, I suppose, tha irrationality* **Why cut

V

Harris and leave Dallas and Bexar at-large for n? apparent
reason?

Two, the effect Miaving those two at-large was to

minimize, dilute, or oppress the minority vote in those two—>
Q

But there are other metropolitan areas that

;

had multi-member districts?
MR. RICHARDS:
Q

There were and—

And they did not touch those.

MR. RICHARDS:

And that, I suppose, is a shortcoming

on the part of the plaintiffs.

This case was tried—

27
Q

That was because there was net any finding

with respect to racial impact.
HP,» RICHARDS:

Thera ware no findings made with

respect to racial impact as regards the other multi-member
districto in the state.

And the reason was, and it is of

record, "bin case war, put together end tried in a compressed
period of time and we stated very frankly to the court we
were not conceding the legitimacy of the onus, but we
simply could not muster the proof in the time frame in
which we were operating.
Q

Other than the racial itera, the district

court would have contemplated handling all metropolitan
areas the same one way or another, absent the racial—
MR. RICHARDS:

They did not do that and they

did not—
Q

Eventually they would have—

MR. RICHARDS s

That may or may not be a fair

construction of the opinion.

I suppose they clearly would

have in the event evidence came forward in terms of racial
or ethnic discrimination; but clearly yes, they would have
considered it.

Whether they would have in absence of such

evidence or findings implemented single-member districts,
I cannot second-guess them on.
Q

Otherwise, they would have left existing

what they said was an irrational—

In all candor# X suppose we would

But they did not do it and the contentions were not there.
And how they would react, if and when we were back in court
making that contention, 1 cannot toll you.
But there it--at least let me say--that tkoro is
a difference in my mind between a multi-aemfcar district that
lets a county of 150,000 electing two legislators and a
multi-member district of a million four electing 18, simply
in the capacity to isolate.the minority.

Inertia alone is

a force, it seems to me, when it becomes that sise.
G

Would you refresh my recollection,

Mr. Richards, as to how many representatives Harris had?
MR. RI CHARDS;
Q

Harris had 23.

MR. RICHARDS:
Q

Twe aty--three,
Bexar had how many?

Eleven.

Dallas, 18.

Dallas, 13.

ME. RICHARDS:

And one of the ironies, 1 guess,

in the plan was that in Bexar County, one of those counties
left at-large and presumably all operating pursuant to a
state policy of preserving county lines, the board for some
reason cut a piece out of Bexar County, attached it to a
rural district, for no reason that this record will explain.
It worsened the deviation, as a matter of fact, that would

29
have resulted had. it teen left intact.

And K suppose it was

whimsical things of this nature which caused the—
or capriciousness,. X suppose, is a better word—caused, X
believe, the lower court to find that there was simply no
rational purpose underlying this plan, clearly no rational
.purpose as far as the at-large representation in the urban
counties.
Or stated the other way, the at-large representa­
tion in the urban counties in no way fostered a state
purpose of preserving county lines.

Indeed, of the 11

counties in which they were left at-large, eight of them
were actually cut.

There are county lines and portions of

the county removed and allocated to other districts.
Q

Something you said prompts me to ask this

question, and I will try not to take too much time with
it.

Suppose in a large county like Harris it was

demonstrable that there was no racial problem at all but
that Republicans were concentrated in certain areas and
Democrats in the larger areas, and that the Democrats in an
at-large situation could dominate it indefinitely, electing
all of their party members.

Do you think that gives rise

to a constitutional problem?
MR. RICHARDS:

The court below did not think so.

It refused to find so—
Q

Has this Court ever indicated that there is

30
a constitutional issue in that kind of situation?
;-:r. RICHARDS:

Well, there is dicta or at least

certain opinions of this Court suggesting that if the plan
diluted, as X recall, racial or political minorities, that
it might be invalidated under the Equal Protection Clause,
You have not so held, as X understand it,
Q

No, but it has not been held.

MR, RICHARDS:
Q

That is my impression,

Suppose the Catholics, for example, were

concentrated in one area and aon-Catholi.es of all kinds in
another.

Would you say that gives rise to a constitutional

problem?
MR. RICHARDS:

If there were historical

exclusions of the Catholics from the franchise and from
every aspect of life in that community, X would suspect so.
0

No, I am not assuming any of that.

MR. RICHARDS:
mean to suggest that

We are not here arguing—-I do not

we are—that only blacks can represent

blacks or only Catholics can represent Catholics or that
there is an entitlement to a representation sort of vertical
of someone of my like kind»

We ar© simply arguing that

this system on this record establishes the kind of dilution
that this Court said it would invalidate when it saw it,

Q

On this religious hypothesis that 1' gave you—

MR. RICHARDS:

Conceivably it could rise to the

Q

T think that is clear.

But you saa no constitutional—

MR. RICHARDS:

I am not saying I see none.

I

simply see that I do net have to carry that burden, I think,
in tills case.
Q

I am just trying to see how far this problem

of dealing with abstract minorities ia carried.
MR. RICHARDS s

-We feel that we arc dealing with

a precise minority that comes in a context that we think
demonstrates how it can be submerged.
Q

‘She Court has used the term "identifiable

minorities."
MR. RICHARDS:

And Texas identified that minority

by statute, by its practices and policies for a number of
years, and it is just finally beginning to cease identifying
them.

Now, having identified a minority, I suppose they are

stuck with it, we would argue.
Q

In Dallas County has there been any racial

discrimination in voting of any kind in Dallas County since
April 14, 1944?

M . RICHARDSIf you sissan, your-. Honor--the record

voters presented themselves at the polls in a Democratic
primary in Dallas and were fold they could not vote there.
X would net suggest to you, however, that -that has beer-, the
case.

2 think the case has bean the poll tax; the case has

been the substitution for the poll tax the annual registration
system.

I think the record will show other factors which

in fact did deter black voting, and I think the poll tax
being the clearest one of that case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ED IDAR, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE MEXICANAMERICAN APPELLEES BERNAL
ST Mi.
MR. IDAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
Pursuing the matter that has just been raised, 1

think that for cur part wa would like to stress
Jvpsoiv* of the right fee v:c us going far bayood merely
casting a ballot# marking it and casting .»
ro held*

And this Court ha

And our position here primarily us to Bexar

County is that because of certain statutes in. Texas # our
minority in Bexar County has been totally submerged»
1 would like to point out that the lower court

found that race is still an important issue in Bexar County
and that because of it# Mexican-Amerleans are frozen into
permanent political minorities destined for constant
defeat at the

hands of the controlling political majority*

X will emphasize that this is a finding made by
three judges who have spent their entire life in Texas# one
of them being Judge Wood from San Antonio»

1 would like to

stress on the multi-member district issue that as far as the
legislative redistricting board# whan it initiated its work
on the House redifsferiefeing plan# it expressly had before it
certain cautionary language on the part of the Texas
Supreme Court in the case of Mausy v. Legislative
Eadirttricting Board # which is the one that mandamused the
board to redistrict the House*
The Texas Suprema Court#who presumably is familiar
with the demography of our state# of our municipalities# our
metropolitan areas# of the distribution and concentration of
the minority groups# expressly stated as follows;

"In

35
exercising its discretion as to whether to create multirfVY-'rry districts within a single county, we must assume
that the board will give careful consideration to the
question of whether or not the creation of any particular
multi-ir,arobor district would, result in diacrimination by
minimising the voting strength of any political c:c rz trial
elements of the voting population*”

I. would like to point out to this Court that it is
on the record that from 13SO to 1970 there was only five
Mexican-Americans who had bean elected to the Teras House,
one of them in 1890» four of them since 1961.
1 would further stress that between I860 and
1970, and til is is part of the record and it is uncontroverted,
out of 133 races in the Democratic Party primaries, only 22
were entered by Me3d.can~Araeri.cans„

And, of course, as X have

already stated, only four were actually elected during that
period.
From the particular area where the MexicanAmerican is concentrated in San Antonio, which is on the
record as the 23th contiguous census tract area, only four
candidates ran from that

area between 1960 and 1970, two

Mexican-Americans, one Negro, one Anglo-American.
X cannot overstress what Mr. Richards touched upon,
and that is the sisse of the multi-member districts that we
are dealing with.

Bexar County, 630,460 population—the city

36

of San Antonio is $54r000~~is larger than l? of the 132
- -

larg

combined peculation of femr of those countries «

it is

leager than 11 ataf.es that elect 3? United Svvc-.yv:- senators,
it has a land area larger than the stats of Rhode Island,
1,246 square miles.

1't is larger both in land area and

population than the District of Columbia.

Four senate

are elected from statas that have a total population less
than Boxer County.
Q

You will touch upon the suggestion made fey

your opposition that one of the reasons is that the
Mestican-Amerleans do not turn out to vote.
MR. IDAR:

We do not vote.

1 think we have to—•

that is where the racial history of our state comes into
play. Your Honor, and I would like to stress something.
Since 1966 through 1972, we have had ©ix federal court
decisions dealing with the electoral system in Texas, five
of those between 1970 and 1972.
aside in 1966.
1970.

The poll tax was set

The excessive file and fee requirement in

The six months residency requirement in 1972.
Over in Crystal City, a small town in South Texas,

a local city charter provision requiring property ownership
for election to city office was set aside by a single judge
district court.
In the case of Garza v~. Smith in 1971, certain

provisions in vh* Texas Electorsi Code defying fchs right to
.iX3.itt.rate voters to have an election officer help them mark
the ballot was set aside on the grounds that that same right
was not denied to blind or physically disabled voters.
When I touch upon illiteracy in that casa» I roust
point out that persons that may be illiterate in English

sire not necessarily illiterate persons, because they do
speak and read Spanish and they do follow Spanish radio and
televisionp and they do have the means at hand

to form

political judgiaents«
We have had in addition to that., since 1971, three
decisions having to do with jury service, the denial of
opportunity to serve on juries, and we have had six
decisions since 1970 dealing with education.

One of them

is now before this Court, which is the one involving the
Rodrigues oaaa in the Edgewood School District in San
Antonio on school finance.
So, in reply to that question. Why do we not vote?,
we need to assess the situation of the Kexican-Aroerican as he
has developed in the history of this country, as late as
1972.

We cannot wipe all cf these hindrances and then

overnight, expect the injured group to be able to compete
on an equal footing with those people who have never been
hindreed.

And when you throw them into the type of multi-

member district county that we have where they have to

We cannot equal;, n; onbars

defined

So, our position Is that

ho rnusa of these hindrances—true we do not vote to the
extent that other people have done so.

Incidentally, I

^o/ M'-y to mention that another part of the record is that
the Anglo-American population in Bexar County
will vote on a ratio of six to one to nine to °he

against

Mexicah-American candidates.
I might further point out that as a result of the
single-member districts that were imposed on the county,
were ordered for the county by the trial court, at the time
the case was triad, out of ten representatives from Bexar
County to the state legislature, nine were Anglo-American,
none was black or Negro, none were Republican, and only one
was

of mixed Mexican, Anglo-/American parentage.
Today, as a result of last year’s elections, there

are four Mexican-Americans, one Negro, and two Republicans.

In Dallas County today we have, three—
Q

How many'Democrats?

IS» IDAR:

The Mexican-Americana and the black or

Negro are Democrats.
Q

Out of how many--*

MR. IDAR:

Out of 11,

That would make eight

Democrats—X‘am sorry, ten Democrats, because only•two
Republicans were elected.
Q

Butthere were four Mexican^Axnerleans?

MR. IDARs
Q

One black or Negro and two Republicans.

So, five out of th® ll were Mexican-American

or Negro?
MR. IDAR:
G

Yes.

Is that what you would expect--

Is®. IDAR:

Not necessarily, because we recognise

that a single-beraber district is no rnilleniura, it is no
panacea.
Q

I suppose that you probably have a majority,

an actual head-count majority in the district.
MR. IDAR:
Q

In the suburbs, yes, Your Honor.

Again, you are failing to register to

MR. IDAR:

vote.

In the ones where no Mexican-'Americans

were elected, I do not know about any Mexlcan-Axnericans running
in any of those suburb races.

1 do not believe so, Your Honor.

I think they were mostly concentrated in those districts where

40
they felt they haci an opportunity,. whether or not they had
a substantial majority- of the vote»
But our argument here is not that we feel entitled
tc representation as sueh.

Our argument is that we are

entitled to participate.- to an opportunity to competef not to
be counted out by the cost of running an election? the cost ■
of campaigning? the area in which vs would have to campaign?
by the attitude of the other people in the organisation.
1 must stress the fact that as Ear as the MexicanAmerican is concerned? there is no need to circulate
campaign literature showing what he looks like? because his
name his name makes it pretty self-evident

on the ballot.

And if you do not want to vote for a Mexlcan-hmerican, all you
have to do is look at the name on the ballot. ■ You do not
have to resort to overt measures or racial methods? say? for
hitting back at your opponent.
X would like to make reference to one stipulation
that was referred to this Court? and that is a stipulation is
on the record that nobody has been denied the right to
register and vote.

X have already stated that we feel the

right to vote goes far beyond just the right to register and
vote.

But I would like to say the stipulation relates only to

the named

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GIBBS GEE, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICAN APPELLEES

0

The argument seems to be made, as I recall it,

that a minority, any kind of minority, is entitled to have the
area structured so that it can get the maximum amount of
representation without respect to whether they do or do not
register to vote.

Did 2 follow that?

[Continued on page following.]

42
Ml;

-SEE:

Perish the thought, Mr

That irr. not our position.

Chief Justice„

Our position is that any minority#

except perhaps a political one, such aa :i represent# is?
entitled not to have the area structured so that they do
not have a. fair opportunity to participate.

We claim no

right to any special preference.
May it please the Court# I would like to
very briefly to a question which was asked by Mr. Justice
Stewart of Col. Jaworeki.

As regards the state policy# the

trial court noted at page 21-A of the Appendix# the
jurisdictional statement? in their trial brief the state
asserted-—this is the trial brief# may it please Your Honor#
in the Kllgarlin case—in their trial brief the'‘state
asserted that the explanation for the differing treatment
of Dallas and Harris Counties was that whenever a county
attained a million residents or was allocated 15 legislators
and so forth.
1 would like to respond to one other suggestion
m&de by Col. Jaworski# and that is that Dallas was multimembered because of the desires of the citisens there.
This record makes it amply clear that the desires of the
oitisens there# taken by a professional and disinterested
poll# which testimony was before the redistrioting board,
wore two or three to on© in favor of single-member districts#

It falls me to me* may it please the Court* to
attempt to handle in a very short time quits a few things,
and I am going to attempt to move along rath®:: quickly.
Q

What about jurisdiction?

MR. GEE;
Q

X intend to say a word on that and I—

Jurisdiction comes rather early in a case,

you would think,
MR, GEE:

Customarily* Mr. Justice White* it does,

i will attempt to deal with that right now then.
In the past this Court has--which certainly is
the expert on its own jurisdiction in these matters—has
held that the three-judge court, as in Moody v, Flowers or
in the Mew heft case* must be properly constituted by a
pleading asking for an injunction having statewide impact.
Q

Do you tha challenge the legitimacy of the

three-judge court in this case?
MR. GEE:
Q
would.

No, not at all.

I would not think so,

Not at all.
I would not think you

So* there is a properly constituted three-judge

court?
MR. GEE:
G

There is no doubt of that, Your Honor.

So, the only question is whether there was an

injunction en'

;hab would invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court.
MR. GES*

Mr. Justice White, in the gun case—in

•*ha gun case this Court held that where en Injunction was
not entered, even though the three-judge court, war properly
constituted, that this Court did not have jurisdiction.
It is only a step from that to a holding that

the Court's jurisdiction is inappropriate in this case where
an injunction which is now—which applies to only two.
counties in Texas, for example.
Q

You do not have any authority for that?

MR. GEEt

No, sir, we have no authority whatsoever

blit I suggest that by a molding of what the Court has held
in the Moody and in New Left, with its decision in—
Q

Bub the statute just says an injunction.

MR. GESs

X am aware of that, Your Honor.

However

X would like to point this out to the Court—
Q

That was the only jurisdictional question

there is, then?
MR. GEE s

Yes, Your Honor.

♦

Q

Let us assume that we disagreed with you and

said that there was a jurisdiction—of what?
MR. GEE?

Of the injunction, which applies to

Dallas Comity and Bexar County, Mr. Justice White—

Q

And you would say that even if we have

45
:• nrisdicfcior., it would not extend to reviewing the judgment
of the court with respect to the variations?
MR. GEE:

1 would not wish to say that the Court*s

Pendent jurisdiction would not extend tc that,
1 will say this, however, if the Court intends to
hold that the procedural device of alleging a claim for
statewide relief and perhaps contending only narrow
injunctive relief, a complainant can place jurisdiction in
this Court whether it will or no, then the Court's
jurisdiction

is likely to be widely extended.

I would suggest that if the relief sought here
had been only in Dallas and Bexar Counties and the relief
sought had been granted, then we would have precisely the
same case as regards the practicalities of the matter at this
point.

It is not the seeking of relief having statewide

impact which calls for immediate review by this Court.

It

is the granting of it and the disruption of the state’s
processes which is incident thereto, it seems to me.
I would like to say a word about Dallas County.
Time is very short.

Quite a bit has been said about it.

The Court has long been troubled, it seems to me, by the
tendency to submerge minorities which is inherent in the­
sis© of multi-member districts.

Connor v. Johnson notes

that the single-member district is the preferable model, and
in Whitcomb v. Chavis the,same note is made, and even earlier

46
in the Lucas ease way back in 1964 ,

The Court realises that

the larger the district gats, fcko more invidious its effects
are.

Hers we deal with the largest districts lenovm to

exist in the entire country, and if Dallas is number one, if
it please tha Court, Bexar is number two.
At the time of tha trial—and heaven knows what
it.is now—Dallas had 1,327,000 people in it and 500,000
registered voters,
15 states,

Dallas was larger in population than

Thirty United States senators are elected from

constituencies which are smaller than that to which a man

is intolerable.

I submit that this situation

It might hive been otherwise.

This is not

the case of the great wide open spaces of west Texas where
you have to take in a great deal of land in order to get
an ideal district.
This is something which could have bean and should
have been otherwise, and would have been but for the board
and its plan.
Bexar County is described by Col. Jaworski as much
smaller.

It is smaller.

It is not quite a million people.

Yes, yes.

Supposing Harris and Bexar and Dallas are

Protection Claim, would you still claim there is any

MR. GEE;

I think it would be very bad policy to

have districts that size, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, bar it

of different systems of representative government in Texas,
which raises the Equal Protection question.

Q

I thought, Mr. Gee, going back to my Brother

Rehnquist's question, that you were making the argument that
in a district as big as Dallas, quite apart from how the
state treats

Houston and quite apart from any racial

discrimination, that you were making the basic argument
that in a district as big as Dallas it violates the
Constitution to have multi-member districts.

Are you not

MR. GKE:

In spite of Whitcomb v. Chavis and

because of Sullock y„ Carter, Mr. Justice White.
I would like to say one last word on tuo subject
of Mahan v. Howell, which has just been handed dow* and
which X think no argument on this subject ought to
disregard.

In Virginia, a 16 percent variation was upheld

by this Court because Virginia had decided to let its
legislature pass local legislation, as I understand the
Court’s opinion.
I would like to point out that under the Texas
constitution, the legislature not only is not authorised
to pass local legislation; under the Texas constitution
the legislature is specifically forbidden to pass local
legislation.

Article III, Section 56, of the Texas

constitution states*

"The legislature shall not, except as

otherwise provided in this constitution, pass any local or
special law authorising regulating the affairs of counties,
cities, towns, wards, or school districts, locating or
changing county seats, incorporating cities, towns, and so
forth, creating offleas or prescribing the powers and duties
of officers"—

Sometimes they

are, if the brackets are broad

Legislation with closed brackets which says cities

of so and so population is generally .not sustained.
It seems to me that this is a valid distinction
between Mahan vy Howell.

Tf county legislation is done by

the Texas legislature, it is certainly done in the dark of
the aioon, and it is frequently invalidated by the Texas
Supreme Court.
Further, Texas unlike Virginia, as is indicated by
the Court's opinion, has not consistently followed a state
policy respecting county lines.

In Smith v. Cra.dd.ick,

the

Texas Supreme Court felt constrained to invalidate a
legislative plan enacted by the Texas legislature for its
disregard of county lines? and it has not, may it please the
Court, done so in this case where 19 counties are cut.

I

divided.

The record is clear that 19 counties—

Supreme

Court*s mandate in Smith v« Cr&ddick.
Q

How many counties in Texas?

MR. GEE:
Q

254, X believe.

The statement is that only one small county

lias been invaded and that threw me off too.

It means that

only one of the 19 counties that was invaded was a small one?
MR.. GEE;

X think that is what it must be, or it

is sometimes described in the brief as a rural one,
Mr. Justice Stewart.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Jaworski, you have some time left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEON JAWORSKI. ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. JAWORSKI;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
On the jurisdictional question, I think that
perhaps the questions that have been asked by members of the
Court have brought out the basis on which we argue

the

matter of jurisdiction, and I would merely say to the Court
that we have cited in our brief the cases that are applicable.
We also have undertaken to show to the Court that the cases
on which the appellees rely are not applicable.
Actually what has been done here has a statewide

53
impact„

Q

;oid

tin*,

state t&ks cn appeal to the court of

appeals, effect an appeal?
MR. JAWORSXI:

Ho, sir.

No, sir.

What happened w&a that a part of the appealr you
may recall, this Court entered a judgment and the appeal that
casae up from Harris County, you may remember, the Court
entered a judgment dismissing that part of it, not for lack
of jurisdiction but for other reasons.

In any

event, this has been fully briefed.

I

do pot think that 'X need to take the time of the Court.
Actually 1 did not see, because of the rule first that this
actually had statewide impact? but, secondly also, thes
pendant jurisdiction rule I had not taken the time t© really
argue that to the Court in the original argument.
Passing on to something else, Mr. Justice Stewart
did ask me about the history with respect to Harris County,
and it was that, history, with respect to Houston, Harris
County, that X undertook to say X was not fully
with.

familiar

The history as to Dallas County has been one

consistently of rcraltd.-member districts.

But as far as Harris

County is concerned, I answer that there were flofcerial
districts in 1965; there were three multi-member districts
in 1366? five multi-member districts in 1971.
history as the record shows it to be,

This is the

I merely point that

54
out because Harris County did have seme history of some
rr;.iti“mrofeer districts.

But it also has a history that

really shows, boy, that there has been a division.
And when we speak of polls, for inotanco, in Dallas
Comity in connection with the matter of polls, 1 think we
get into some difficulty, because the polio, a;: we know
if they are going to be polls, relate to how wall :
candidate is running; they may have some accuracy.
was not referring to polls.

But X

I was referring to what had

actually been requested of the representatives of the people.
And the record shows this.

The legislators had made known

the wishes with respect to what they wanted in Harris
County and also what the situation was as desired in the
other counties.
With respect to the matter of policy, actually
I do not know where the idea got into the record that there
had been -any state policy with respect to the matter,
Mr. Justice Stewart, that was raised by a question you
referred to where the .15 district matter arose.
What actually happened was that the limitation was
never offered in the state policy.

At one time, the House

Committee on Congressional and Legislative Districts had felt
that multi-member districts should be somewhat limited in
size because of the voting machine problem.

These changes

in the voting machines and the difficulty of getting them and

ss
the difficulty of their cost and placing so many of them
did raiso a question*

But this was largely done to

ciccossaod&te the new change that had been made in the voting

machines.
The limitation was never offered as a state
policy, as this record will show, and there is no indicationf
as I read the Kilgarlln case, that the Court was assured
that the limitation would be continued in future apportion™
ment plans.

This is just simply something that we find

unable to follow completely.
Then when we speak of single-member and multimember districts, or single-member districts throughout the
state, there is an interesting Texas Supreme Court case which
we have referred to in our brief.

It is the Mauzy case,

as we often refer to it, and there the Texas Supreme Court
refused to grant the relator's request that the board be
ordered to use single-member districts throughout the state.
And you will also find under Smith v, Craddick case, decided
by the Supreme Court of Texas, that there is absolutely
nothing found in there.

This is the Texas Supreme Court

talking about multi-member districts itself.

If they found

that in any part of the state there was an unfairness with
respect to the matter of multi-member districts, I think
they would have said so, and consistently there has been
nothing along that line intimated.

5G
On Berar County, X just want to again say this,
day it please the Court, that what the court said in effect,
the trirl court, is, ttv?e are condemning it, act because it
operated to dilute or cancel the vot<

ist by the Mexican-

ns,**which I think is the test which would

>ly here..

What the court said in effect is, "We believe that this
way"—>and the hypothesis and the reasoning that the court
applied—"we believe this will encourage more MexicanAmericans to vote."

Well, of course, this vo cannot accept

as the test of the criterion, in determining the constitu­
tional issues that are before the Court here.
Q

Mr, Jaworski, 1 still have a problem between

Dallas and Harris County as to why one is single and one is
multi,

l still have trouble with that,
MR. J&WORSKX;

I can just say this to you»

If I

saw anything in the record at all, anything that showed that
it was done as a result of doing snore than just seeking to
comply with what the legislators have said they thought was
appropriate in those districts, then I would have some
trouble with it too.
Q

But X find nothing.

They could have just as easily told Dallas

single-member districts, just as easily, could they not?
MR. JAWORSKI;

They could have, yes, sir,

I mean,

except unless you get in scans minutia., some very great
refinements which, very frankly, I would not even .suggest.

57
although you do have a difference in sisse» you do have some
difference»

To a wottM find it perhaps inore acceptable in

Houston than. you. would in Dalles- County.

There is; a

considerable difference in the sisse of fci* e two.
considerable difference in tie cry the tar
actually lie.

ne.v.

On© is much more compact than the other one.

But 1 just have to frankly say that if there wore anything
here that suggested that it had been done for the purpose
of diluting or canceling strength of any group, I would
immediately say that there was & serious question with
respect to it, but you just will not find that in the
•record»
absent

And this is why I say that there is nothing,
something that casts doubt upon it or that shows

that it was done for seme ulterior purpose or that there
is some lack of good faith involved, X say that there is
nothing to keep a state from having both multi-*member and
single-member districts in soma of its localities,
X thank the Court,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Jaworski.

Thank you,

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:25 p.m. the case was submitted.]
