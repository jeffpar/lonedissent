MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We will hear arguments
next in No, 71-909, Environmental Protection Agency against
Mink.
Mr. Cramton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER C. CRAMTON, ESO.,
ON BEHALF,OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CRAMTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Freedom of Information Act suit was brought by
respondents to compel the release of documents prepared for
the President relating to the then proposed and now completed
underground nuclear test at Amchitka Island, Alaska.
It presents fundamental questions concerning the
scope and application of exemptions 1 and 5 of the Freedom
of Information Act.
Whether documents

prepared to advise the President

with respect to an underground nuclear test, many of them
containing top secret and secret information, are exempt from
compulsory disclosure under the Act.
And whether a district court should be required to
make an in camera inspection of the documents in order to
determine whether portions are non-secret or factual in
character,
The facts may be quickly summarized.

On July 28, 1971, Congressman Mink asked President
Nixon to release reports prepared for him relating to the
proposed Amchitka test.

The President declined to do so,

his counsel replying on July 30 that, quote, "these recommenda­
tions were prepared for the advice of the President and involve
highly sensitive matters that are vital to our national
defense and foreign policy,"
Several weeks later respondents instituted this
action pursuant to the Information Act,
A separate litigation, Committee for Nuclear
Responsibility vs. Seaborg, the so-called CNR case, was brought
by an environmental group to enjoin the test itself.

This

Court denied an application for an injunction in that case
on November 6, 1971, a little more than a year ago.

And the

Amchitka test was conducted successfully later that same day,
A partial or total declassification and public
release of declassified parts of three documents involved
in this case occurred in connection with the CNR litigation.
Respondents continued to seek the undisclosed material,
t

including three classified documents not involved in any way
in the CNR case.
The district court in this case, without in camera
inspection, granted the government's motion for summary
judgment, holding that the documents fell within exemptions
1 and 5 of the Act

The district court relied on an affidavit of Under
Secretary of State Irwin, who is chairman of the National
Security Council Committee which prepared the report for the
President on the Amchitka blast.
The nine documents sought by respondent are
described in some detail in the Irwin affidavit.

Three,

including the report of the Irwin Committee itself, and a
top secret report from Dr. Kissinger, are classified as top
secret.

Three others are classified as secret, including

reports from the AEC and the Office of Science and
Technology.

And all nine documents, as the Irwin affidavit

stated, and I quote, "were prepared and used solely for
transmittal to the President as advice and recommendations
and set forth the views and opinions of the individuals and
agencies preparing the documents, so that the President might
be fully apprised of varying viewpoints,"
The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case
to the district court for in camera inspection of the
documents, and a determination whether disclosure should be
ordered as to some of the materials.
It ruled that documents classified as top secret and
secret, pursuant to Executive Order 10501, should be
reviewed by the district court, to permit disclosure of any,
quote, "non-secret components which are separable from the
secret remainder."

6

With respect to the government’s claim under
exemption 5, that the nine documents were internal memoranda
containing policy advice, the court held that the documents
should be reviewed in camera to permit disclosure, and I
again quote, "of factual information unless it is extricably
intertwined with policy-making processes,"
In both respects, I submit, the court below was
grievously in error.
The starting point is the language of the Act,
Exemption 1 excludes from the Act the disclosure requirements,
and I quote, "matters specifically required by Executive
order to be kept secret in the interest of the national
defense or foreign policy,"
"Matters specifically required by Executive order to
be kept secret,"
The legislative history makes it clear that this
language means what it says, that the exemption protects from
,

*)

disclosure governmental records, such as six of the nine
documents sought here, which have been classified as top
secret or secret pursuant to the authority granted by
Executive Order 10501,
Respondent's argument that the President must
individually classify each document by a separate Executive
Order is preposterous on its face.

When Congress enacted the

Freedom of Information Act ixa 1956, it legislated against

7
the backdrop of many years of operation of the classification
system.
Executive Order 10501, which has provided the
basis for classification of defense information since 1953,
was repeatedly referred to during congressional consideration
of exemption 1.

And clearly it is an Executive Order which,

quote,"specifically requires certain matters specified therein
to be kept secret."
When a document is properly classified pursuant to
the applicable Executive Order, the government is not required
to review the document paragraph by paragraph, to determine
whether portions of it are non-secret, and may be disclosed.
Executive Order 10501, which is reprinted in the
Appendix to our brief, treats the document as the appropriate
unit for classification purposes.
QUESTION:

Tell me again the difference between

top secret and secret.
MR. CRAMTON:

It's a difference in degree.

The

language of both Executive Orders, the new and the old,
require somewhat greater showing of jeopardy to national
defense and foreign policy interests for a classification as
top secret rather than secret.
QUESTION:

Is that the best you can do?

MR. CRAMTON:

Both Executive Orders spell out, in as

clear language as was available to the draftsmen, matters which

were vital to national defense.

The latest Executive Order

mentions —
QUESTION:

I'm not saying that in criticism, I

don’t think you can do any better than that.
saying any criticism at all.

I'm just not

It’s just puzzling to me.

QUESTION: Well, there purports to be a criteria,
the alleged criteria, set out on page 49 of your brief,
top secret is (a), secret is (b).
MR, CRAMTON: Right. And then there's confidential
as the third part of it.
QUESTION: And confidential is (c) in the —
MR. CRAMTON:
QUESTION:

It's just matters of degree,

A matter of degree.

MR. CRAMTON: The most secret and sensitive data
falls into the top secret category.
Well, once a document which contains vital defense
information has been classified, all material in the
particular document is protected under exemption 1.
QUESTION: Would it be reasonable to assume that in
most classified documents there are sentences and paragraphs
and parts that are completely innocuous?
MR. CRAMTON: There may well be.
Now, in many cases it would be impossible as a
practical and administrative matter to separate them out.
In many cases they will be inextricably intertwined.

9

There may be situations in which only a very small
portion of a large document deals with classified matters.
Many agencies have regulations that require a paragraph-byparagraph classification.

And the new Executive Order extends

that practice more generally to the federal government as a
whole, to the extent practicable.
My point is that Congress adopted the Executive
Orders and deferred to the procedures applicable under those
Executive Orders, and those Executive Orders refer to the
document as a whole, except to the extent that the new
Executive Order, promulgated last spring, does push agencies
in the direction of a paragraph-by-paragraph marking of
paragraphs of a larger document.
What significance would you give to the provisions
of this legislation that provide for a de novo hearing in a
district court and put the burden of proof on the government
agency?
Any at all?
MR. CRAMTONs The significance is very considerable,
under some of the exemptions of the Act.

I think the

significance is much greater —
QUESTION:

Well, with respect to this one, as you

say, an ex parte affidavit,..and that*3 the end of it, right?
MR. CRAMTONs Congress has said that the matter is
exempt and immune from disclosure

10

QUESTION;

Well, it hasn't said anything about --

MR. CRAMTON:

-- if it’s classified pursuant to an

Executive Order, dealing with national defense information.
QUESTION:

And here we have an ex parte affidavit;

am I right?
MR. CRAMTON: That’s right.
QUESTION:

No opportunity for a court to determine

whether or not, even if this was stamped secret or top secret.
MR. CRAMTON: But absolutely no reason the affidavit
itself, in its surrounding circumstances, to question the
assertions in the affidavit itself.
And the circumstances of the test, here we are
dealing with a weapons test in the atomic field, in an area
in which it is known that not only our technological lead
in the military field is vital to our national defense, but
also in an area in which it’s well known, because there are
treaty obligations, because of the international — the
sensitivity of the international community on these matters,
where it is well known that there are foreign policy
repercussions.
And the Irwin affidavit places those documents
plainly — the six to which exemption 1 applies — squarely
within the core area of the interest that Congress intended
to protect and remain privileged.
QUESTION: So, do I understand, then, that your

11
answer to ray question is that with respect to category 1,
this language just should be wholly disregarded, that the —
MR. CRAMTON:
QUESTION:

Mo, not entirely.

— that the burden is not on the

government agency, and that the court has no business
determining the matter de novo, despite what Congress has
enacted.
MR. CRAMTON: The court may properly impose a burden
on the government to supply an affidavit which lays out the
— it describes the documents, and which lays out the
surrounding circumstances.

The government did that here.

Now, if you had a situation in which the likelihood
or the possibility of any secret matter being involved, then
further inquiry by the court might be appropriate.
QUESTION: Well, normally that’s not the way a court
operates, is it, to take ex parte affidavits and say that's
the end of it, you've sustained your burden of proof.
MR. CRAMTON:

It surely is in this area.

— the holding of the court below is totally novel.

This is
It is

the first case which has ordered the United States to produce
for in camera inspection documents which the United States
/

claimed and plausibly showed by the surrounding circumstances
in the affidavit, we're military or state secrets.

This is

the first case of that kind.
And let me refer to some of the other, some of the

12
earlier precedents.
QUESTION:

Well, I have a bit of a problem showing

that it has military significance, except your word that it is.
MR. CRAMTON:

I don't see how anyone could doubt that

the yield, the methods, the scientific technology involved
in testing of atomic weapons involves the most vital and
sensitive matters to our national security.

And hov? anyone

could think that a nuclear weapons test in the present
international climate is not also a matter which involves
vital foreign relations interests of the United States.
QUESTION: Does the affidavit say that's the only
thing that's in this document?
MR. CRAMTON:

No, it does not, but it says that the

documents were prepared to advise the President, and that
they contain classified and secret information.
QUESTION: Which they say would be injurious to the
national welfare?
MR. CRAMTON: That is correct,
’Niv

•

QUESTION: Which the government said.
MR. CRAMTON: That is correct.
QUESTION: Well, how do we test that?
MR. CRAMTON: The same way that you test a claim
of the privilege against self-incrimination.

You do not

require the defendant who claims, or the witness who claims
the privilege against self-incrimination to incriminate

13
himself, even before the judge in camera, in order to get the
benefit of the protection which the law has designed to
extend to it. All you require is that he give a hint as to
why an apparently innocuous question may lead to the
discovery of a clue to information that may be incriminating.
QUESTION:

Please, Mr. Cramton, don't put the

government's position on the same level as a defendant pleading
the Fifth Amendment.
MR. CRAMTON:
QUESTION:

You do?

MR. CRAMTON:
QUESTION:

I do,

Under our constitutional scheme, —

Oh, that's where you're going to put it.

MR. CRAMTON:

— the operation of the Office of

President, just as the operation of the Supreme Court of the
United States and the Judiciary is —
QUESTION: Well, please don't put —
MR. CRAMTON:

— extremely important in its

operation.
QUESTION:
Amendment prong.

Please don't put me on the Fifth

I can't speak for the rest of the Court.

MR. CRAMTON: The limited role of the courts in
passing upon classification determinations of the Executive
Branch is well established in prior decisions.
.

We discuss the Epstein case in our brief.
QUESTION: Are there any constitutional issues

14
involved here?

1' thought this was purely a matter of

statutory construction»
MR. CRAMTON:

It is purely a matter of statute,

except that you have to act and interpret the statute as the
Court always does in the light of the constitutional backdrop.
No claim of executive privilege has been made in this case.
QUESTION:

I didn’t think so.

MR. CRAMTON:

But the Information Act does offer the

great potential and the great risk of direct conflict between
coordinant branches of government.
When the same question comes up in connection with
the privilege for state secrets, in private civil litigation
or in litigation in which the government is a party, there’s
never a direct order to a government official to produce or
go to jail.
What happens is the government is penalized in the
1 itigation if it refuses to produce information that the
Court believes is relevant to the opponent's case.
The Information Act context is very different,
because in the Information Act context you nan the risk of
an order directed to the Executive to produce materials which
the Executive may believe are in fact constitutionally
privileged, as well as privileged under this statute.
QUESTION:

I thought the inquiry that the district

court was supposed to make was a rather limited one, under

15
■(b) {1} .
ME. CRAMTONs

He is supposed to determine whether

portions of the document may be safely revealed to the public.
Now, it's our view that that is an inquiry that
district judges should not make.

One, it invites them to

substitute their judgment for the executive who has made the
classification determination,
QUESTIONS

I didn't think that — well, you know

more about the case than I do. But I thought that a lot of
tilings, collateral documents, went under the big umbrella,
because they —
MR. CRAMTONs
QUESTION*

No, all that was taken care of

— were merely related and not because

they had been separately designated as secret by the
Executive.
MR. CRAMTONs The government does not contest that
part of the case, the decision below that deals with
classification by association.

Neither the earlier Executive

Order nor the new Executive Order protect documents which
contain no classified material but happen to be in a
classified file.

We do not contend that unclassified

documents inside a large file are protected.
We do contend —
QUESTIONS

You have no claim, then — no objection

to their treatment under (b)(1)?

The court —

16

MR. CRAMTON: What's — under (b)(1),, you mean —
QUESTION: Well, the Court, of Appeals said that,
on page 27 of the Appendix, the first full paragraph:

Such

documents are not entitled to the secrecy exemption of
subdivision (b)(1) solely by virtue of their association with
separately classified material.
MR. CRAMTON: That's right, our petition for
certiorari says we do not contest that part of the case.
So it's clear that the Executive Order requires
documents to be classified on the basis of the information
they contain.
QUESTION: And the only other thing that I recall that
they passed on was sub — articles under (b)(5).
MR. CRAMTON:
(1) is applicable here.

No, no, we do claim that the exemption
The exemption 1 is applicable as to

six of the nine documents which are involved.
What we do not contend is the doctrine, the so-called
classification by association that was so discussed by the
Court of Appeals.
We do contend that the district court should not
examine in camera top secret or secret documents in order to
determine whether they were properly classified, whether they
contain secret material or whether portions of them may
properly be made available to the public.
We think that a district judge just doesn't have the

17
informational base to do that, and particularly if it has
to be done in camara without the assistance of the adversary
process.
QUESTION: Congress apparently did think the district
court had the ability to do it, because it said:

in such a

case the court shall determine the matter de novo, and the
burden is on the agency to sustain its action.
Now, do you —
MR. CRAMTON: But that's —
QUESTION:

— do you think the court's incapable?

Maybe we might think it's incapable.

But Congress gave that

function to the district court.
MR. CRAMTON: That has to be interpreted in the past
history and light of dealing with military or state secrets,
which is the correlative evidentiary privilege that has
always existed, and which this Court construed in the Reynolds
case, in which the Court said the court should not make an
in camera investigation, even in chambers where —
QUESTION:

Was that on this statute, was it in

construing this statute?
MR. CRAMTON;

No, it was not.

QUESTION; Well, that's what we have here is
statutory language, and what does it mean?
MR. CRAMTON; That it was adopted in the background
and light, and the legislative history is very clear, that

18
what Congress was doing was not asking the courts to secondguess the classification determination of the federal
government, —
V

QUESTION; Well, what does this language mean in your
submission?
MR* CRAMTONs

It means under exemption 1 as to whether

or not, at the most, the classification determination made by
the Executive is not arbitrary or capricious.
The government can be required to show by an
affidavit and the surrounding circumstances that secret
material is involved, and that has surely been done here, as
it was done in the Reynolds case*
QUESTIONS

There's been no cross-examination of

anybody.
MR. CRAMTONs
QUESTIONS

No, there has not.

Normally, that's what happens in a

district court, and there’s no indication here that there
should be more limited —
MR. CRAMTONs

Even the respondents do not contend

that the adversary process is going to be fully operative here,
and that high government officials are going to be asked to
testify and be cross-examined as to the exact content of this
document.

How could anything be maintained as secret?

Any

person, in bring an Information suit,could then get the
secrets revealed merely in the process of trying to find out

19
whether or not they were exempt.
And I think the analogy of the privilege against
self-incrimination, of the procedures \ised in the application
of other privileges, are highly relevant here.

And the

Reynolds case, the Epstein case are directly in point.
QUESTION!

How should wa construe de novo, then?

MR. CRAMTONs

It means that the court should

decide on the basis of the information that satisfies it that
t he exemption is applicable.

And here the government's

affidavit and the surrounding circumstances do provide
information which show that military secrets and foreign
policy secrets are involved here.
How could anyone think otherwise?
QUESTION! What did the district judge do with —
when that was presented to him?
MR. CRAMTONi

He accepted that contention and he

did not examine the documents.
And respondents have appealed,
QUESTION!

Mr, Craroton, -—

MR. CRAMTON!
QUESTION!

Ye3, sir,

-- I'm looking at page 46 of your brief,

which sets forth the Freedom of Information Act, subsection
(b)

thereof.

I wonder whether you think that provision does

not take out of the requirement for a de novo hearing
altogether situations where the Executive has issued an order

20

of the character involved in this case.
MR. CRAMTON;

It says it does not apply to matters

that are specifically required by Executive Order; and I think
that falls clearly within the language of this case.
QUESTION;

In other words, —

MR. CRAMTON; Exemption 5, it seems to me, would
give rise to somewhat more discretion of the court, because
it refers in its own language to the procedures used by the
courts in civil litigation on discovery.
QUESTION;

But does the de novo provision apply

at all to the two types of exemption you're relying on in
this case?
I don't know; and I'm asking you for your opinion.
MR. CRAMTON:

I think it does, I think it applies

to the entire Act, but it has to be read in the light of the
language of the particular exemptions, and the desire of
Congress to protect certain material from public disclosure.
QUESTION; Well, I read this provision as meaning that
if it fell within No. 1 of (b), that was the end of the
matter, and —
MR. CRAMTONs That is the government's -—
QUESTION;

— no could require that.

MR. CRAMTONs That is the government's view.

Now,

we do —
QUESTION: Who is to determine whether it falls within

21

that?
MR. CRAMTON:

— we do concede that the government

by affidavit and surrounding circumstances has to make a showing
that at least you're in the area of state secrets.
For example, if the respondents had sought documents
dealing with hog prices on the Chicago market, put together
by the Department of Agriculture, there might be some judges
who would be properly skeptical of whether or not state
secrets were involved, and the court could properly require a
more detailed affidavit which would convince the court of
whether or not you were in a core area that the privilege was
designed to protect.

But you should not destroy the interest

you're trying to protect in the process of showing whether
or not the privilege is applicable.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, the government could

say these hogs are involved in atomic energy research, and
then that would be it.
MR. CRAMTON:
that.

No, the court can require more than

Then you know more than that.
QUESTION:

This was —-

How much more?

MR. CRAMTON:

— the Amchitka test blast involving

nuclear weapons.
QUESTION:

Hot* much more, in your hog case?

MR. CRAMTON:

These were documents prepared by Dr,

Kissinger, and the National Security Council, and so on.

22

You know a great deal more, and you know that all of the
information that relates to environmental matters, bushel
baskets of it, has already been made public.
What the respondents want are the advice given to
t he President in connection with a secret underground military
weapons test, and the military secrets that are involved in
those documents.
Now, I’d like to turn briefly to exemption 5.
QUESTION:

In (b)(5), the inter-agency documents,

you find a split among the experts as to whether or not this
is relevant to the military aspect of the problem or not.
MR. CRAMTONs Well, exemption 5 is designed to
protect the decisional, deliberative process of the
government itself and make sure the deciders get candid and
frank advice, just as this Court needs it among itself, and
with its personnel.
Now, it’s our view that all or the documents
*

involved in this litigation fall within exemption 5.
Under Secretary Irwin's affidavit states that these
documents were prepared and used solely for transmittal to
the President as advice and recommendation, and the>respondents
concede that that's the case.
Congresswoman Mink's request for the document was
to the President, and she said she wanted the reports and
recommendations that he had received.

23

The argument is that a district court should look
at these reports and recommendations and advice and try to
separate out the factual material from the judgmental and
policy material.
Well, in the first place, I don't think that can be
done, and particularly in the context of presidential
decision-making.

Here you have the heads of agencies, and

the most trusted advisers be forced to briefly condense their
facts and arguments so the President can decide an important
national issue.
The selection of facts, the organization of facts,
the arguments and the relationship to arguments is fully as
much of the policy-making process as the selection of
facts and arguments in a brief is part of the art of
advocacy.
So the separation in the light of this case seems
to me to point to the entire documents clearly falling within
the core area of privilege.
Now, the decisions say that where you have low-level,
routine, factual reports, that those can be made available
and the district court can properly separate out judgmental
or policy aspects that are usually found in introductory
paragraphs or conclusions.
But you don't have that kind of a case here.

Whatever

may be done in cases that deal with such matters as scientific

24

testing of VA hearing aids, or with the routine appraisal of
property by a government appraiser, or with the inspection
of the physical wreckage of a plane by government mechanics,
whatever may be done in those cases, in terms of a more
detailed affidavit, or even, in soma instances, an in camera
inspection, is not appropriate here where we have the
highest level of decisions, where we have a special matter
»

of great importance, complexity and delicacy, and which
falls right in the core area that Congress was trying to
protect with exemption 5,
QUESTION*

If I read the Reynolds case correctly,

the government had the choice, was put to the choice by the
court — that was an airplane crash case —
MR. CRAMTON: That’s right.
QUESTION:

~ where there were a lot of military

equipment, sights, and various things? and the court put them
up to the choice of either defaulting on the judgment or
yielding the information.
MR. CRAMTON:
I think that it is not.

Was that correct?

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may correct you,
In the Reynolds case, government

affidavits and government affidavits alone asserted that that
plane crash had been in connection with a tasting of a
military airplane.
equipment.

There was involved secret electronic

That affidavit was accepted on its face by this

Court, and this Court went on and said:

on that kind of

.25
showing, with the surrounding circumstances, the aircraft
investigation reports would not be made available even to the
judge in camera, because otherwise -—
QUESTION:

Yes, but, wasn't the government required

then to submit?
MR, CRAMTON: The government was the defendant.
QUESTION:

In terms of liability.

MR. CRAMTON: The court actually went on and held
that since the Tort Claims Act had waived the liability of the
United States only under such conditions as it consented to,
t hat you could not penalise the government where it was a
defendant under the Tort Claims Act.
But in a civil litigation, in the criminal
prosecution situation, where the same question arises, that
is the result that's usually reached.

That is, the government

is penalized as a litigant because it does not supply
information that the court thinks is relevant, and the
government then has the option, unlike the Freedom of
Information Act situation, of losing the litigation or
abandoning it, and preserving the secrecy of information that
it thinks should not be divulged in the public interest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cramton, as I thought, in advance

of the argument in this case, that we would be faced here
with a matter of construction of a statute and only that,
no constitutional questions, and no questions of evidence

26

law or federal common law, but just with the construction of
a statute.
And in that connection, I wonder if you could
tell me, the word "section” on page 46 of your brief, does
"section” mean the entire Freedom of Information Act?
It's a little confusing to me, where it says "This section
does not apply".
MR. CRAMTON: Yes, it means Section 552, it's an
exemption from ail the provisions of the Act.
QUESTION :

Of the whole Act?

MR. CRAMTON:
QUESTION?

If I might clarify —

"Section" means the entire Act, is that

it?

*

MR. CRAMTON? That's right.
If I might clarify your comment.

Constitutional

questions are involved here only in the sense that they
provide a backdrop for the interpretation of statute.
Common law questions are involved in connection
with exemption 5, because exemption 5 by its very language
refers to whether or not a private party, in a hypothetical
litigation with the government, would be able, on discovery,
to get that information from the government. And the rule is
that it would if information would routinely be made available.
My time has expired.
QUESTION:

Now, one other question, if I may, going

27
to the last line in the Act:

"This section is not authority

to withhold information from Congress."
That declares, I take it, simply that this Act is
not directed at the congressional powers to secure information
which they do usually by the subpoena process, I take it?
MR. CRAMTON: That is right.

1 did not see fit. to

stress or reply to respondents' arguments that Congressmen
have special rights under this Act,

It is clear that they

do not.
The rights of the Act extend to any member of the
public, the language in paragraph (c) on page 47 is
clearly.a savings clause.

It just says — this Act has

nothing to do with the powers of Congress as an institution
to compel information.

And it surely is a somewhat, I think,

e ven shocking notion that an individual Congressman could
compel information either from the government or from other
private citizens, just on his own say-so,
QUESTION: Well, when a Member of Congress comes into
the courts, he comes in just as any other citizen.
MR. CRAMTON: That is right. The law treats us all
equally.
QUESTION: This is not an action authorized by some
comzaifctee, is it?
MR. CRAMTON:

No, the Congress is not involved in

any institutional capacity. The respondents are acting in

28

their individual capacities only as "any persons" under the
Freedom of Information Act,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Clark.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAMSEY CLARK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLARK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I think in fairness to the court below I should
point to a few facts that primarily show there was an urgency
at the time of considerations below that do not obtain now.
And that explain the posture of the case.
I say that particularly in connection with the last
question.
Actually the Court of Appeals began its opinion and
ended its opinion with the observation that it didn't answer
all of the questions before it.

It was dealing with a motion

f or summary reversal.
The case, in a sense, began with a newspaper
article.

It's, I think it’s very important for the Court to

consider it in the light of the New York Times case, because
it's closely related; you may recall the Solicitor General in
the New York Times argument referring to the fact that there
could have been a case under the Freedom of Information Act to
have obtained those documents.
In a sense, this case may tell us whether the Elsberg

29
waYt so to speak, is the only, way available, or whether
there is a judicial sancition that can be used to cause the
disclosure of information.

On July 26, 1971, there was an article in the
Washington Star that said two agencies, the Department of
Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission, were urging going
forward with this Cannikin-Amchitka five-megaton detonation,
which was then scheduled for October of that year.
It went on to say that there was a controversy
within the government, that five agencies were opposing the
test; and it described them as being the Department of State,
the United States Information Agency, the Office of Science
and Technology, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Then it, as you cgn see from the record, it alluded
briefly to the reasons.
Now, when that came forth, Congressmen who were
particularly concerned about the test and primarily people
from Hawaii and California, because there had been
earthquakes from seismic action in the Aleution chain that
had caused deaths and great damage in Hawaii and in California,
immediately sought to determine what the nature of these
reports was, what facts there were within these reports,
because, as Congresswomen and men they had two actions coming
up before them in the immediate future:

the Authorisation

30

Act for the Atomic Energy Commission was before them in July
of that year, and in August; and the Appropriations Act for
that agency and for this very test.
Now, it was in that urgent context that this went
before the court. The suit was filed on August the 11th, it
was disposed of by partial dismissal and partial summary
judgment for the government.

On August 27, the Court of

Appeals expedited, as did the court below, in accordance with
the;.mandate of the Act itself, and the situation as well, and
heard argument in late September, mid to late September, and
decided the case October 15,
Now, as I said at the beginning it began, it
summarily reversed, but it began with the observation that
after considering the argument of counsel, and these covered
t he entire range of the complaint and the responses and the
motions for summary judgment that both parties had filed,
that this case was inappropriate for summary disposition.
And that it was not going to summarily dispose of the case, but
it wanted, in a practical way, to give some guidance to the
district court so there could be some expedition in review of
this information to see if it could be submitted to the
Congress before the test.
And it's in that way that the case went back down,
and there were only two areas in which the Court of Appeals
summarily disposed of the issues before it.

31
First, it said that classification by association
is erroneous.
Now, all it had before it was the Irwin affidavit.
All it knew about the documents was what was said in the
Irwin affidavit.

When you look at the Irwin affidavit, you'll

see that one document, the Impact statement, so-called, was,
as a matter of law, public; the Congress required that it be
published.

That each of the other nine was restricted as

secret, top secret, or under the Atomic Energy Commission
as restricted data.
Now, when you see what happened in a parallel
case with these very documents, that it's now argued that
we should not be able to see at all, you find that they have
been reviewed.

Three ware partially disclosed in a

collateral case, of these very documents, that the government
is now arguing we shouldn't be able to see, were disclosed
to the plaintiff in the environmental case, the Nuclear
Responsibility case.
Six were permitted — I say permitted, in the
sense that the government conceded that the district court
could review them.

Here it's in camera, here it said that

that shouldn't happen.
Of the six that were reviewed in camera, the six
of these ten, five were specified in the Irwin affidavit.
It didn't say they're partially classified top secret; it

32

said they are classified top secret, or secret, as the case
may be.
Yet these were reviewed, five of these.
Two were entirely, insofar as the record in that
case which is before the Court shows, were entirely classified
secret or top secret and they were reviewed by the court
below.

The very thing that is not permitted here now.
All the Court of Appeals said was:

if there is

matter within these documents that can be separated without
distorting its meaning, if it’s not so inextricably inter­
woven — the phrase below — that it can be separated, do it.
That’s what it directed summarily, by summary disposition,
the district court to do.
And it said that if it is necessary, then you
should review in camera to determine these two issues,
whether there are documents attached to other documents and
classified, as was the case in fact, although the Irwin
affidavit didn't show, and classified merely by association,
and the Court of Appeals has never had that concession before
it that was made here, the concession was made in footnote
4 of the petition for writ of certiorari here; that the mere
attachment of an unclassified document to a classified
document, even though specified in 10501 Executive Order
to permeate the documents so attached with the highest
classification.

For purposes of the Freedom of Information Act,

33

it does not become so classified.
And then the other part is whether there are
components within a single document that would not be
classified, and that is all that the Court of Appeals has
done, and it’s asked the court below to look at these in
camera.

Now, X think —
QUESTION:

Well, that goes considerably — what the

Court of Appeals has done goes considerably beyond the language
of the exemption in (b)(1), does it not, which would seem,
at least on the face of the literal words, that the court
should limit its inquiry to determining whether these
matters were specifically required by Executive Order to be
kept secret in the interest of thenational defense or foreign
policy.
Wouldn’t you agree?
MR. CLARK:

Well, no, I wouldn't.

QUEOTICii: Well, I’ve accurately read the exemption,
haven’t I?
MR. CLARK:

Well, I think the key to it, though,

is the Court of Appeals opinion.

It expressly says that it

is not going to resolve by summary disposition the test to be
applied under exemption No. 1.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Yes.
We had urged to the district court that

-the test be the test that President Eisenhower and President

34
Kennedy and President Johnson and President Nixon had all
prescribed for executive privilege when pled before the
Congress, and that is that the President cause an independent
review of each document and each part of each document as to
which the privilege was to be extended be made, and that it
be classified on that basis.
The government roughly, below, said that there is
no power in the court to review it. We say it's classified?
that's it.

The court has no power to determine whether we're

correct or not, or whether what we say is true.
QUESTION: Well, that's what the language seems to say,
doesn't it?

*

MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

No, I think not.

I think when it says -~

Well, what does it mean if it doesn't

mean that, Mr. Clark?
MR. CLARK:

Well, I think, first, that the Act

clearly gives jurisdiction to the court to
agency from refusing to disclose.

enjoin a government

It requires —

QUESTION: As a general proposition?
MR. CLARK: As a general proposition, yes.
QUESTION: But then this is a specific exception,
is it not?
MR. CLARK: Well, there are nine specific exceptions.
QUESTION:
No. 1.

Yes, well, we're only concerned now about

35
MR. CLARK: Well, 1 and 5 both.
QUESTION:

Yes, well, 1 primarily.

When it says

this section does not apply to matters that are, and then
describes what there is under No. 1.
MR. CLARK: Well, I can think it can only mean one
thing, and I really can't believe that the government would
contend otherwise.

It only means that this section does

not require, or give the power to the courts to enjoin
disclosure, where it is determined by the court as a matter
of fact, that one of these exemptions applies.

Otherwise

the Act has no meaning,
QUESTION: That's right.
MR. CLARK:
to do is say:

Has no value.

All the party ever has

No. 4, it's trade secrets.

You can't see

whether it's trade secrets or not, you don't know what it is.
You have to take their word for it.

The veil of

secrecy in the Executive Branch falls at that level, and
there is no capacity, no power in the Judiciary, if that
section means that these nine areas are completely exempt,
it just means that the courts will decide, and if it
decides that the material or the matter, as it says, is
specifically required, then they cannot compel disclosure.
But the court must decide, not the Executive.
QUESTION: But under the language, what are the
.limits of the court's decision?

That was my question.

36

MR. CLARK: Well, —
QUESTION;

I suppose it could be read that if you

find that this has been specifically required by Executive
Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense
or foreign policy, that's the end of the court's inquiry,
even though they —
MR. CLARK:

Well, there are several things that

should be said, and I think —
QUESTION: That's certainly what the language seems
to mean on its face to say.
MR. CLARK:

I think, not necessarily "matters"

doesn't mean all of an entire document? you may have something
the thickness of a telephone book, you frequently do in this
area.

There may be one paragraph in the whole thing, as I

think the government conceded; clearly this couldn't mean,
and that's precisely what the Court of Appeals has
pointed out.
And the only reason it did it i?as because of the
ambiguity of the Irwin affidavit.

The Irwin affidavit in

some places would say "this document is separably classified
top secret", in others he would merely say, "it is classified
top secret".

From that, on the basis of our knowledge, we

assume that it was classified perhaps by association, and
we asked the court below, the trial court, and the Court of
Appeals to face that issue.

If it's classified, if the

37
document itself is not classified secret, but it is attached
to one that is, are we not permitted to get it under this
Act?

And the government has now conceded, in that situation,

that we are.
QUESTION:

I think that perhaps the government has

c onceded more than it needed to do under this language.
I'd suggest that the way this is worded, that it
could be well argued that the limits of the court's inquiry
with respect to exemption No. 1 under (b) is whether or not
it has in fact been required by the Executive to be kept
secret.
No matter if it's the District of Columbia telephone
book.
MR. CLARK:

I really think not.

I think even if

thatss true, that the new Executive Order 11652, which, by the
way, became the prevailing law in this area two days after
*

the petition for certiorari in this case was granted, requires
this very paragraph-by-paragraph, or generally contemplates
this paragraph-by-paragraph classification, which is the only
thing that makes any sense.
Our contention below has been that even 10501 is
not the specific requirement that tvas contemplated, and the
Attorney General's memo that was promulgated in June of 1967,
this Act become effective on the 4th of July, which was an
appropriate day because I think this Freedom of Information

38

is essential to freedom in a democratic society.
QUESTION:

You put a great deal of weight in your

argument, as I understand it, on the adverb "specifically”,
don't you?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, I do.

I really dont think this

issue is before this Court at this time, unless it wants to
consider matters the Court of Appeals didn't consider.
Because the Court of Appeals specifically says, it is not
going to dispose of that by summary disposition, and I thin k
very wisely, for the very reasons that the Chief Justice,
in the New York Times case, said we don't have the facts.
Let's get the facts.
And here you don't have the urgency in this Court
now, and this can go back and the trial court can look at it,
and it can make, after it sees these documents, that judgment.
Now, the idea that courts cannot look at documents
classified secret is beyond my comprehension at this time,
I thought they brought 47 volumes into this Court and into
the courts below in the New York Times case.
We've seen throughout the wiretap area that the
?
Solicitor General comes in in COLOD and other cases, seeking
in camera inspections.

We've seen the same tiling in the

grand jury cases, Dennis v, 0. S., where they seek the court
ex parte, by an in camera proceeding.

And I'm frankly not

high on in camera proceedings; but that’s all this Court of

Appeals judgment gives us at this time.

I don't think it's

cut off the other.
QUESTION:

Well, you referred to some

constitutional cases, would you — am I wrong in thinking
that the only issue in this case is the meaning of a statute
enacted by the Congress of the United States, that there are
no constitutional issues here at all.
MR. CLARK:

Am I wrong in that?

I think they're clearly constitutional

issues in those parts of the case that the Court of Appeals
specifically declined to pass on by way of summary
disposition.
I think that appropriately this Court would only
consider the statute, because I think that that is all that
the Court of Appeals did.

But if you want to go in under the

general problem of Executive privilege, and that has not been
raised here, it has not been thoroughly briefed, and I think
in terms of judicial administration it would be a serious
mistake, why, that can be done.
is going to have to do it.

I think the district court

I think it’s raised by the

pleadings•
But I think the Court of Appeals, because it had
before it a motion for summary reversal, wanted to get this
thing moving.

As a matter of fact, the blast went off on

November the 6th, and & that time we had not been able to
obtain the information.

It's very unlikely that the Congress

40
there are 33 plaintiffs here who are Congresswomen and men
— could have done anything about it.
QUESTIONS Then I'm not wrong, if I understand what
you said, in understanding that this is a matter of the
construction of an Act of Congress, isn't that what we have?
MR. CLARK:

I think, as a matter of proper

judicial administration, that's right.

I think, as a matter

of jurisdiction, this Court has jurisdiction over the whole
case, in issues that the Court of Appeals specifically
declined to pass are before you if you want to pass on them.
I think it would be unfortunate to get into them.
I think that all the Court of Appeals said was that when you
claim an exemption under 1 or 5, it is imperative that parts
that can be severed from that, because the purpose of this
Act is to reveal as much information to the public as can
possibly be done,
QUESTION:

Does the Executive Order now meet that

problem — the new Executive Order that you've just referred
to, Mr, Clark, that it was obviously intended to give more
flexibility to go through a document and if there's a lot of
material that's perfectly innocuous, as there's bound to be
♦

in any classified document, that that can be severed out.
With that, isn't the problem as to the truly
classified material still going to remain under Section 1
or paragraph 1, with the Executive?

41
MR. CLARK;

Well, I think that the new Executive

Order, if implemented, as I assume it will be, will narrow
the range of review that a court will have to make. But I
think ultimately, that when it comes before the court, and
it comes before the court very infrequently, I don’t believe
there have been forty cases at this time that have raised
this issue; and when the government pleads exemption for
matters under exemption No. 1, because they involve military
or diplomatic secrets, then the court will have to review
first to see if there is matter combined in there that
should have been weaned out under the new Executive Order
but wasn’t? and, second, whether they were arbitrary and
capricious in their judgment.
Now, that issue is really not properly before this
Court at this time, because of the nature of the summary
disposition, below.
QUESTION: Are you suggesting, Mr. Clark, that perhaps
this whole case in this Court is premature?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Well, we opposed the cert. And I think —
On that ground?

Of prematurity?

This was a summary disposition, and we

opposed it as being something that -- for instance, we didn’t
get all the rulings we wanted below either, but we saw no
reason to counter-petition because we thought our opportunity
was still viable in the court below.

So, yes, sir, we did

42

— v/e did on that ground.
But I think that it would bo wrong to dismiss as
improvidently granted at this time, I think the Court of
Appeals is entitled to an affirmance.

I think it's — I

think what it's done here is the very minimum.
QUESTION: But if wa dismiss as improvidently granted,
t hat would leave their judgment, of course, to stand undis­
turbed, wouldn't it?
MR, CLARK:

But I think we know the problems in

judicial administration here, and I think both the Court of
Appeals and the district court are entitled to have review
on what — I don't think you should go, this is just my
judgment of sound judicial administration, beyond what the
Court of Appeals did.
And all the Court of Appeals really did is said:
Look at these documents and where there is ~ where there are
documents, first, that are severable, sever them.

And there

v/e re some •
But the Court of Appeals never got to see them.
The Congressmen never got to see them. The district court in
this case never got to see them.

They were severed, and in

another case they came out.
And then where within a document there is material
that's severable, do that.
Now, that's precisely what Judge Hart did, he went

43
through documents in the Nuclear Responsibility case that
were both classified secret or top secret, and as to which
there was an exemption No. 5, the decisional processes of the
Executive Branch claimed; and he extricated some and
disclosed it, required its disclosure, and he left others
secret.
In other words, he performed the judicial function
that I think this Act requires:

he tried the matter de novo;

he placed the burden on the government of showing the
exemption,

I don't think the burden on the government means

anything of showing the exemption if the exemption is
totally excluded by the fiat of the Executive, any considera­
tion of the matter before them.
QUESTION:
(6)

Mr, Clark, I realise that subdivision

is not relevant in this case, on page 46, paragraph (6)

I think you'd called it under (b); but suppose the personnel
and medical file of some individual were involved, and there
was some matter which he did not want disclosed.

Is it

your view that a district judge should examine the medical
file and see whether this should be disclosed or not, or is
the medical file of the treatment of a person completely
private?
MR. CLARK: Well, I think at the very least there
\fould be a judicial responsibility to look and see if this
is just a medical file, or if it's a file that says "medical'’

44
on it, and it!s got all other kind of matter in it.
I think that ' s —
QUESTION:

Well, what if it * s an affidavit of the

Commandant, let us say, of one of the military hospitals,
that the ~ all the documents inside of this file relate to
the diagnosis and treatment of the named subject? and there is
no matter here except that, and it is of the utmost privacy.
Some such statement.
Then is the district judge, under this Act, to look
at it and see if the doctor is telling the truth, or does it
make —
MR. CLARK:

I think that absolute, yes.

First,

not just because we have an adversary system,: and that really
relates to personal privacy, I felt very strongly about that
exception when the Act came in.
But, second, really this is part of a system of
checks and balances; that's what this statute is about.
QUESTION:

Well, it's here now, it’s passed.

MR. CLARK:. That's correct.
QUESTION:

And I still have difficulty getting away

from the language "this section does not apply".
MR. CLARK: By the very nature of that one, you
know, we haven't — this section does not — but it says
"which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy".

A doctor is supposed to make that decision?

45
Or a judge is supposed to make that decision?
Suppose it* s quite important to a plaintiff in a
case.

Suppose that this individual to whom this file would

relate has done something and this information is important.
QUESTION: Well, I'm not raising this question in
terms of getting some information in a lawsuit involving some
injuries, I’m talking about these plaintiffs in this case,
or plaintiffs like these, asking that the information be
made public, not as evidence in a lawsuit.

Just as a matter

of general public interest.
MR. CLARK:

Well, I think the test is —

QUESTION: Do you suggest that —
MR. CLARK:

I think the test is whether it would

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
and I think that's a judicial test to be made tinder the Act
by the Judiciary.
I don't think that
QUESTION:

Then (b) ,"this section does not apply"1,

doesn't have very much meaning.
MR. CLARK: Well, I think it has meaning.

I think

it tells you exactly the material that the courts cannot
compel disclosure of.
But I think the Act tells you that the courts have
to determine whether the matter in question is that, falls
under one of those exemptions.

46

I think if that’s not true, then the Act really
has no value because labeling can read the Act out of
operation, all you’ve got to do, all the Executive has to do,
ndawe're talking about checks and balances, and we're talking
about something that the Congress has done, and I don't
know another area where the Congress has acted where the
courts have not performed the judicial function that's
essential in that situation.
QUESTION;

Mr, Clark, doesn't this get us right back

to the questions that Justice Stewart has been asking.
You referred a little while ago to (b)(4) having to do vith
trade secrets, and clearly someone has to determine what a
trade secret is.

And you say this is the district court.

(b)(1) speaks of "specifically required by Executive order",
and isn't that just as far as the court has to determine
the situation, vrhether it is or is not specifically required.
I think this was Mr. Justice Stewart's inquiry of
you.
MR. CLARK;

Yes, right.

QUESTION; As I understand it, you want to go one
step further and say not only whether it was specifically
required, but whether it was in the interest of thenational
defense or foreign policy? you want to go into that lower or
further inquiry? am I correct in that?
MR. CLARK;

Well, I see it a little different.

I think X don't want to go that far, by one step,

simply because the Court of Appeals has specifically, in
its opinion, declined to make that adjudication by vray of
summary disposition.

All it has said, and I think it

follows necessarily, is that if there's a document that is
not classified but is attached to another document, then it
would, I suppose you could say, inherently be incapable of
having been specifically designated.
Somebody may have slapped a poster on it, but the
Act wanted full disclosure, compatible with these key
interests here.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose, Mr. Clark, one of the
keys here is that section 3, anyway, isn't it, what the
court is supposed to do, as I read this, order the production
of any agency records

improperly withheld from a complainant.

«

And in order to determine whether it's improperly withheld,
if the claim is it falls under (b)(1) or anywhere from (b)(1)
to (b)(9) , a judge has got to decide whether the particular
papers satisfy 1 to 9, and if they say they do not, then
they are improperly withheld, is that it?
MR. CLARK:

That's my understanding of it, yes, sir,

Your Honor,
They have to look at the papers to do that, very
frequently.
QUESTION: But in the determination whether something

48
is improperly withheld, I guess that's what the next
sentence means, "in such a case the court shall determine
the matter de novo,6’ and the burden is on the agency to
sustain its action?
MR. CLARK?
out of it,

That’s the only meaning that 1 can read

I think, in connection with Justice Blackmun’s

question, that there are two steps to No, 1, but I don’t think
those steps were considered or adjudicated by the court
below or should be by this Court.
But I think first it determines whether it was
specifically required, and second whether it was clearly
erroneous.

At least that would b© the standard that I propose.
But the Court of Appeals didn’t feel it necessary,

and I think wisely so, to detemine that test at that time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, turning to No. 3, there are

two of these which have a qualification that the other
paragraphs do not have. No. 1 has specifically required by
the Executive? No, 3 has "specifically exempt by the statute."
Now, in one case it’s the Congress speaking by
statute and in the other case the Executive by order.

Do

you think that 1 and 3 are different in this regard from the
others?
MR. CLARK:

No, I think —

QUESTION? What inquiry would a district judge make
on a matter if its specifically exempt from disclostire by

49

statute?
MR. CLARK %

Well, I think the analogy here would be

if the Executive came in and said, Here is the statute,
Your Honor, and cites the statute, therefore you can't look
at this matter; you have to take ray word because it's in the
statute.
QUESTION; Well, suppose the statute said that all
medical records of any military hospital shall be exempt from
disclosure?
MR. CLARK;

Then I think the judge would have to

look and see whether there is anything in the file other
than military records, medical records from a military
hospital.

I don’t think that in our adversary system, or

particularly in a place of critical checks and balances,
that we have here, because obviously if you can put a stamp
on these things and preclude judicial review, the Act has
no value in terms of checks and balances.
I think that the court would have to look at that
file and determine in its work, but it’s the functionthat
is imposed upon the judiciary by this Act.
So we would urge affirmance.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3;13 p.m., the case was submitted,3
