ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. BRUM, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BRUTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court, may it please the Court:
This litigation is now before this tribunal for the
second time.
On the first occasion, this Court ruled in Lemon v.
Knrfcgman, that Pennsylvania Act 109, providing aid to nonpubl5.c schools, was unconstitutional on its face under the
religion clauses of the First Amendment.
The case has returned here again because there is a
dispute as to the effect and purpose of that prior ruling.
And the question which is now presented is whether
the Commonwealth can now disburse an additional $24 million,
approximately, under the statute, which has been held un­
constitutional, to Pennsylvania sectarian schools.
The relevant facts, I think, are these, and they
fall into two categories.
First, with respect to Pennsylvania Act 109 itself.
That statute provided a scheme for subsidy to the non-public
schools in the form of reimbursement for certain so-called

4
secular educational services, as defined in the statute.
And the expenses,which could be reimbursed under the
statute, included the cost of teachers’ salaries, textbooks,
instructional materials, for certain specified types of courses
of instruction.
The areas of instruction which were included were
mathematics, modem foreign languages, physical sciences and
physical education.
The schools became eligible for reimbursement under
this statute by entering into,in the scheme of the statute,
certain agreements, purchase of service contracts.
And under these agreements, they were to be paid
by the State in the subsequent school year for these so-called
services which were rendered in the prior year.
Mow, it was not, of course, necessary for any school
to show that it had, in fact, added any new teachers, admitted
any new pupils, hired any new textbooks, or otherwise really
incurred any new expenses, in order to receive aid under the
statute.
All that was required was that the school satisfy
the State that the expenditures in question fell within the
defined statutory categories and -- and this is a very vital
and, 1 think -» that the services for which reimbursement was
sought were, in fact, secular, and did not include any subject
matter expressing religious teaching or the morals or beliefs

of any particular sect.
The Commonsea1th was given extensive administrative
powers in carrying out the purpose of this statute with the
right fco audit the performance of each school and its books
and records, to males sure that the expenditures were properly
made.
This, then, in brief summary, is the scheme of the
statute.
I would like to turn now to the chronology of events
here which I think is quite significant.
The statute was passed in June of 1968.

Within one

month, the plaintiffs announced publicly «•* and this was in
the news media -- that they intended to challenge the Con­
stitutionality of this Act.
Of course, the suit itself could not be brought
until it was clear that the statute was operational, that,
in fact, funds were going to be disbursed under it.

Otherwise,

there was a possibility that the claim could be dismissed as
premature.
And it was not until six months later, the end of
1968, that the State issued rules and regulations and forms,
and so forth, which could be submitted by schools seeking
subsidy under the Act.
Now, these so-called agreements were to be submitted
by January 15th of 1969, with schedules identifying the classes,

6
the number of pupils, and so forth.
And then in June, at the end of the school year,
additional schedules were to be submitted which detailed the
precise items of expenditure that they were seeking reimburse­
ment for.
Once it was clear that the statute was indeed
operational, plaintiff's filed suit.
This was in July of 1969.
At that time, the defendants moved to dismiss the
complaint.
And I may say, to the considerable surprise of the
plaintiffs, the District Court panel in a two-one decision
over the dissent of Chief Judge Hasty, granted that motion to
dismiss.
Plaintiff’s immediately appealled to this Court.
Within six weeks after the decision of the District
Court, the schools again entered into these contracts which
are annual in nature, on the 15th of January 1970.
And it is at this point, Your Honors, I would like to
correct a factual error which is in the record, and it has
been in the record, I am afraid, from the time this case was
presented to the District Court on remand.
And I think that Mr. Ball and I are in agreement that
we can now stipulate this change.
The change is this.

It was stated below by the

7
defendants,that on January 15, 1970, the schools entered into
contracts for services to fee rendered in the subsequent school
year, 1970-71.
He have repeated that statement in the briefs that
vie have filed here.
That is not correct.
The contracts that were signed on the 15th of
January 1970, were applicable to services provided in that
school year that was already half over, 1969-70. And it was,
therefore, not until a year later, January 15, 1971, that
agreements were entered into by the schools covering services
for the 70-71 school year.
There is a one-year difference there.

And although

I frankly don't believe that it is critical to the plaintiff's
case here, I think it does have a good deal to do with the
arguments the defendants have, made, as X will come to in a
minute.
The fact that these agreements were not signed until
the 15th of January 1971, means that a number of other inter­
vening events had occurred.
Q

Which are these agreements now?
MR. BRUTON:

X am now referring to agreements covering

the 1970-71 school year.

That is the year and the only year

which is at issue here.
Q

And those are the contracts that were made on

8
January,something,1971?
MR. BRUTON:

That * s right.

Half-way through that

year.
Q

The year, 1 gather, begins September, does it?
MR. BRUTON:

Yes, September 1, I think, is essentially

the beginning,
Q

No point is made as to '69-70, at all?
MR. BRUTON:

That is correct, and I want to emphasise

that the funds that the Commonwealth collected for those years
have already been disbursed to the schools and the plaintiffs
are not here seeking a return of any monies which have already
been paid out.

We are seeking only an order which would bar

any further payment of funds which the Commonwealth still has.
Q

What was the amount of the '69 year actually

disbursed?
MR. BRUTON:

1 do not have that figure.

I believe

that it was something less than the sum that we now have,
about $24 or $25 million, approximately.
Q

Mr. Bruton, was that January date in which the

contracts were entered just a random date or did it correspond
to some appropriation or something like that?
MR. BRUTON:

It is the date which was established,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the schedule which was put out by the
State itself with its rules and regulations, when they were
issued under the statute.

9
What they did was set a specific schedule for the
'68-69

year and then said it is the saiae schedule every year

thereafter.
0

You just add a year.

Mr. Brutonj, do I correctly have the Impression that

you did not seek a temporary restraining order or an injunction
in this case?
MR. BRUTON:
Q

That is correct.

Xs there any significance in that at all?
MR. BRUTON:

is, Your Honor.

I do not believe at this time that there

I think we are now focussing on the question

of whether the impact of this Court's decision in June of
1971, whatever the situation may have been before that, whether
the impact of this Court's decision in June of 1971 was to
prevent any further disbursements under the unconstitutional
statute thereafter.
Q

If you had sought an injunction, would it have been

against disbursement or against entering these agreements?
MR. BRUTON:

Xt would have been against the dis­

bursements .
That is, of course, the ultimate nexus, the focus
of the case.
Q

Well, if these funds can't be disbursed now, as a

Constitutional matter, then recovery of the amounts paid in
prior years is in what status, in your view?

laying aside the

intentions of the parties, 'Constitutionally, could they be

10

recovered ?
MR. BRUTON:

Constitutionally., 1 would say yes,

because 1 think that there is at least since the Tidal Oil
case in 1924, it Is clear that a judicial decision nullifying
statute can have full retroactive operation.
He do not urge it.

We do not urge it here, and

whether on a less than constitutional plane, as a matter of
policy, this Court would determine if it were presented that
question, that it was appropriate to apply the decision that
retroactively, I think is a different matter.
Q

What kind of policy would you call that?

What kind

of policy would we be employing?
MR. BRUTON:
Q

1 think in that —

Official policy?
MR. BRUTON:

Yes, I think I have reference to the

standards which have been suggested in Linkletter and certain
other cases in which it has been indicated that when one is
considering retroactive application one ought to look at the
substance of the rule which is laid down and determine whether
the policy that lies behind that rule will be offended or not
if only a prospective application is given.
I think you would hay© to look at the question of
whether you would be really remedying or preserving the
Integrity, If you will, of the rationale behind this Court's
decision in Lemon, by ordering a return of those prior funds.

11
X suggest that there Is a difference between that
situation and the case at bar, and the difference is this:
this Court, X think, focussed principally in its decision which
came down in June of 1971, holding that the Act 109 was un­
constitutional on its face, on the question of entanglement.
X think there are other threads that can be discerned
in the fabric of the opinions of the Court, but I think this is
— we will assume for the moment -- the primary one.
And, as to entanglement, it is the position of the
defendants here that all the entanglement that there might be
under this statute has already occurred with respect to 197071.
In effect, the horse has been stolen.

There is no

point in locking the bam now.
This contention, the plaintiffs disagree with
vigorously.
We say that there is no indication in this record,
in fact, there is evidence to the contrary, that there has been
the kind of discriminating meaningful inquiry by the Common­
wealth into the applications . which have been submitted by
over 1,000 schools, most of them sectarian, to insure that
these funds would not be used,in fact, for the furtherance of
religious purposes in violation of the Establishment Clause.
And, not only is there no

evidence in the record

whatsoever to support the position of the defendants on this

12
point, they ask simply that you conclusively presume that all
of this lias been done.
I think there is now evidence, and we have referred
to it in our supplemental brief,filed only last week, that
indicates to the contrary.
In fact, the Commonwealth has advised one of
the named defendant schools in this very litigation, the
Philadelphia Montgomery Christian Academy, and certain other
schools, that they are not eligible for any aid under Act 109,
whatever remaining aid there may be under it, because in the
bylaws or charter of the institution there is reference made to
the fact that God’s creation has a bearing on the teaching
practices of that institution.
And, I think, my worthy opponent, Mr. Ball, would be
the first one to concede that the application of that kind of
administrative standard in making these determinations, if
applied to all of the schools in the State, would disqualify
every Catholic parochial school in the State of Pennsylvania.
I don’t think there is any question about that.
The Montgomery Academy confronted with this decision
brought suit against the Commonwealth in the Federal District
Court, seeking to have a reversal.
They were told

not surprisingly, at that point --

this occurring after the decision of this Court striking down
Act 109, they were told they could not have a hearing to review

13
the administrative determination made by the State because
that would create the rery entanglement which this Court has
said is forbidden by the religion clauses*
And so you have a conundrum.

You have an apparenti

arbitrary decision -Q

That Montgomery School, is if: a disbursement for

the '70-71 school year?
ME. BRUTON:
“70-71.

Two years in question.

One of them is

One of them is “69-70, which is also interesting and

I’ll come to that in a moment.
Therefore, I submit that the evidence is that there
has not been the kind of discriminating inquiry. That the
really terribly difficult question of looking into the
classroom — and that's what it came down to in this case —
to determine whether in fact these expenditures would be for
secular purposes.
And, therefore, I suggest that to permit the dis­
bursement of the $24 million now would run directly afoul of
the rationale of this Court’s decision in lemon y, Kurtsaaan,
unless, of course, you simply say pay the money out without
any further inquiry.

And that, I think, would run afoul of

this Court’s decision because it would be done without any
insurance that you weren’t directly violating the Establishment
Clause.
Now, turning to the other side of the coin.

I have

14

been speaking now in terns of the rationale of this Court's
prior ruling and whether it would be offended.
Looking new to the other side, are there any interests
here on the part of the defendant schools which would warrant
an exception to what I submit is the usual effect

given to

a judicial decision.
And, as to whether it is the usual effect, without
getting into the nice philosophical distinctions between the
Blackstonian approach and the brooding omnipresence in the sky,
and so forth, and the more contemporary realistic approach,
X do think it is clear that it has long been recognised, and
for good reason, that judicial rule-making is essentially
retroactive, unless there is good reason to make exception to
that.
Q

You meant to say Constitutional rulings?
MR. BRUTON:

Constitutional rulings, primarily,

although X think one can find precedents which address the
same problem even in other areas.
Q

All judicial rulings are not retroactive, are they?
MR. BRUTON:

Surely injunctions, by their very

nature, are not.
Q

You mean the emphasis on constitutional ruling,

constitutional adjudication?
MR. BRUTON:
address other areas.

Principally,, I don’t think I have to
For example, without getting into it,

15

there are areas, X suppose, open to question when a court
interprets a statute in one way and then reverses itself in
another case at sometime later and interprets the statute in
another way.
There are questions there whether that is a retro­
active, if you will, interpretation of the statute.

Usually,

I think, it is held that it is, although there may be some
exceptional cases.
But certainly in the area of constitutional
adjudication, I think the general rule is that it is retro­
active, unless there is sound reason to depart from that.
And the two principal areas of exception which we
have referred to in our brief are, of course, the bond cases
where you have public bonds being issued in reliance on the
validity of the procedures involved, and then those procedures
are struck down.
This Court has, on many occasions, expressed
reluctance and unwillingness to hold that those bonds now
in the hands of innocent holders are void and that the money
that has been paid for them is simply to be forfeited,
Q

What about the reliance factor hare?
MR. BRUTON:

This is exactly what I am coming to.

First of all, with regard to these so-called agree­
ments, X think there are several points to be made here.
With regard to the so-called agreements -**

16
Q

May I ask why you call them “so-called1'?
MR. BRUTON:

Well, I think there is a real question.

Your Honor, as to whether these agreements are true contracts
in the sense of a quid pro quo between the Commonwealth and
the schools.
The schools don't have to show that they are really
hiring any new teachers, adding any new pupils, incurring any
new expenditures, in order to be reimbursed.
Essentially —
Q

You mean it is a subsidy really?
MR. BRUTON:

They are really being subsidised for

doing what they would be doing anyway.
Now, I know that defendants have cited cases which
indicated that, at least in the law of Pennsylvania, very
technical approach to aspects of consideration can be taken
and you can say there are valid contracts under contract law.
Q

Isn't there a quid in the sense,broadly, for the

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other State, in that
maintenance of private schools relieves the State of con­
siderable burden, and that even an open subsidy, identified as
a subsidy, is a partial recompense for that.
You are now talking just about contract law and
not constitutional law.
MR. BRUTON:

That's right.

Perhaps there is an ultimate quid pro quo.

I think

17
It depends

in

this sense on whether the ~~ I{11 call them

infcerorum, I think, kind of arguments that are made here are
true.

That is, that without this subsidy, you will have wide-

spread closing of private school system and that otherwise this
great burden will fall upon the public school system.
I suggest that the record doesn't really indicate
t ■.

that that's a fact.

It is not the parochial schools that

didn't open this fall for lack of funds in Philadelphia, it
is the public school system that didn't have the money to pay
its teachers.

It was two and a half weeks late.

It is the

public schools who raay have to close early next spring.
But in that ultimate sense, if that were ultimately
shown to be the case, I guess it could be said, yes, there is
a quid pro quo.

I suggest it need not be assumed to be true

at this point.
And in respect of the particular years involved,
I think it is clear that the schools would have incurred these
expenses anyway.
Secondly, you have the fact that the Commonwealth
itself has regarded this statutory scheme as essentially a
subsidy.

Again, I point; to the case referred to in our

supplemental brief.. The Philadelphia Montgomery Christian
Academy was told by the Commonwealth in July of 1970 that it
would receive no payments in respect of services provided during
preceding school year, 1969-70.

18
And3 Interestingly enough, the District Court never
faced that question when it dismissed the academy's complaint.
The Commonwealth didn't talk, about contractual
reliance there, equitable obligations, contractual obligations.
They treated it as a subsidy which could aid should be cut
%

off at any time the State decided that it was improper.
And this is precisely the position that we are
taking.

I think the actions of the Commonwealth confirm it.
Third, the fact is that because the contracts were

not entered into for the year in question until January 15,
1971, the schools have already incurred whatever expenses
there were in teaching these subjects.

They were half-way

through the school year.
And the single most important sentence, I think, in
the opinion of the Court below, which justified the decision
below, was this, and I am quoting from our jurisdictional
statement, page 9

of the Appendix:

"In reliance on these

contracts
Q

Just a moment to find that.
MR, BRUTON:

Page 9 of the Appendix?

I am sorry, it is the Appendix,

Your Honor, to the Jurisdictional Statement, rather than the
Appendix itself.
Page 9 of.the Appendix, which is towards the rear.
The bottom paragraph on that page, the Court said:
"In reliance on these 'contracts"*-» and it used the

19
word contracts in quotes because it wasn't deciding whether
they were really contracts or not — "the non»public schools
adjusted their budgets accordingly and performed the services
required by them."
My proposition is:

how can you rely on contracts

that haven't even been entered into?
And, I think — X can only assume -- if it please the
Court, that the Court below had in mind that these contracts
had been signed on January 15, 1970, not January 15, 1971«
Q

You have a course of conduct of relationships between the

parties that might give a basis for some reliance, haven't you?
MR* BRUTON:

You have anticipated my nest point,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I think that is the next dimension of the argument
that the defendants are making, that they thought the statute
was constitutional.

They say they assumed it was going to

continue to be so, and that therefore they could continue to
rely on the subsidy which they had had in prior years.
And, I think, there it is relevant to look at the
question of what really were the expectations of the parties
hero.
This is not, as we made clear, a case of overruling
a prior precedent.
This is a case in which the statute was passed and
from the very beginning every party involved in it recognized

20
that its constitutionality was open to serious question.
Everyone knew it was going to be taken to the Court
and that ultimately this Court was going to have to decide the
issue.
Q

Say it again, Mr. Bruton.

The date on which the

District Court first held the statute unconstitutional, in
relation to this January 15, 1971, date.
MR.. BRUTON:

The first decision -» X am not sure

I know which decision you are referring to

the first decision

in the District Court was. in November of 1969,
Q

And that was to what effect?
MR. BRUTON:

And that was to the effect that the

statute was constitutional.
Q

Wa3 constitutional.
MR. BRUTON:

Q

They dismissed the complaint.

Right.
MR. BRUTON:

The second decision was not rendered

until after remand from this Court which was in, X think,
November 1971.
Q

So at least so far as any judicial determination,

that determination was favorable of the constitutionality of
the statute?

As of the time these agreements were made.

MR. BRUTON:
Q
decision.

It is correct.

Of course, in the meantime, you had the Rhode Island

21
The Dieeiiso case came down from the three "judge
District Court in June of 1970, before the school year in
question here, eight months before the contracts were signed,
unanimously striking down a very similar statute concerning
salary supplements.
This Court’s decision in Molts v. Commissioner;,
which to be sure, held that tax deductions for religious
contributions were appropriate.
The rationale of that decision certainly prefigured
the ultimate result in this case, and narrowed, really, the
area of principal involvement, I think, between Church and
State, and focussed on the problem of entanglement.
All of these things were intervening.
Q

As you go along, will you let me have your ideas

about burden of proof as to reliance?
MR. BRUTON:

Who has it?

I would be happy to.

Let me start first with the argument the defendants
have made.

They have said, in effect, that in the absence

of any proof, it falls on the plaintiffs and that you must
presume that everything has been done and that there is full
reliance here.
Perhaps, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I have misanticipated
the direction of your question.

I was going to focus on

whether the plaintiffs or the defendants had to show that all
had been done by the State that’s necessary to be done, but

22
perhaps your question was directed to a different point.

I

want to be sure X am responding.
Q

Go along on what you are just suggesting.
MR. BRUTON:

Hell, they have cited the Alien case

for the proposition that on this kind of record it must lie
presumed that the State has been doing everything right, at
this point, that this money can be distributed.
f'r -

•

And I only want to distinguish what this Court did
in Allen from what this Court did in this case, Lemon v.
Kurfczman. where it specifically declined to assume,on the
basis of a bareboned record, that there could be no entanglement
here.
Allen was dealing with textbooks.

The judgment

there was that you can't assume that the State isn't able to
choose the right kind of textbooks in approving textbooks for
the parochial schools.
In this case, where you have teachers’ salaries
involved, and so forth, the presumption was to the contrary,
that there would have to be entanglement.
So X am saying that I don’t think the defendants8
citation of Allen is well-founded on this point, plus the
fact that I say the record does have positive evidence indicating
the State is not doing what it would have to do, really, to
take care of 5„ts constitutional obligations here.
Q

Mr. Bruton, isn't — at least in normal litigation,

23
where you have a judgment of a lower court in your favor -isn’t the normal approach to the equity in the situation that
if you think it is going to be reversed on appeal you get a
temporary restraining order or a stay, rather than requiring the
prevailing party to anticipate the often serpentine paths of
adjudication in the higher court?
MR. BRUTON:

That is certainly often done.

I can

only say here that I don't know what the expense of the
plaintiffs would have been in seeking such a stay, or any
kind of an injunction.

They would have been holding up

funds,and they decided not to hold up those fund3.
And, as I say, again, we are not seeking now to
undo those payments; payments that were made during the period
between trial and appeal have been made, and we are not asking
to reverse them.
We are only talking about the future payments.
Here we are again on the question of reliance.

As

I say, I don't think there could be any genuine element of
surprise here.
I think it's perhaps interesting in connection with
the question you raised to look at the one case in this Court
that I have found which lies in this stress* of municipal bond
cases, Horton v. Shelby County.
Xfc is cited in both of the briefs.
referred to in the opinion below.

It may even be

And what that case is

24

usually cited for is some rather Blackstonian language about
the absolute retroactivity of judicial decisions*
But what I would like to call attention to is the
facts of that case*

Contrary to the other bond cases, in

that case, you had a statute passed which purported to transfer
certain taking powers from one political body to another.
The statute was challenged.
in favor of the statute.

The lower court ruled

In the time intervening between the

trial and the appeal, bonds were issued.

On the appeal, the

lower court was reversed, and in that case, this Court con­
cluded that tte bonds were invalid.
That &ces farther than what we have to do here, but
I think it is the only case in that line of cases where you
find that sequence of events.
Elsewhere, the case always was that there had been
consistent judicial interpretations upholding the statute by
the highest court of the jurisdiction involved.
Subsequent to the issuance of bonds, there is a
reversal of that precedent.
1 think that's a very different case and certainly
not one that we have here.
We are much closer to Horton v. Shelby County.
When you are done, X think, looking at this reliance
question, and really looking at it, not just taking it on its
face, I think the record indicates that there are no genuinely

25
persuasive reasons for departing from the precedents of this
Court in the area of prospective and retrospective application.
Indeed, as 1 say again, in a literal sense, a
prospective application of the ruling in Lemon v. Kurtzroan
will give the plaintiffs the result that they are asking for.
Q

Do I infer correctly, Mr. Bruton, that; if you are

wrong on this reliance point, your case is lost?
MR. BRUTON:

No, I think the reliance point is only

an element which has been indicated in the decisions of this
Court to be taken into account.

I would say that notwith­

standing the reliance, the fact that there is more entanglement
here would override that.
And that for that reason alone it would be
appropriate to deny any further payments.
Q

You mean the entanglement of trying to determine

these past events?
MR. BRUTON:

Precisely.

In conclusion, let me say only that

I

think that in

this case, to grant the relief that the defendants have sought
and have obtained below would carry this Court really beyond
the verge of violation of substantial First Amendment rights,
and beyond the verge of the previous limitations which have
been developed with respect to prospective limitation.
And I don't think that this case provides an
appropriate bridge for this Court to travel in either of those

26
two dtreetions.
Q

Well, would it be appropriate for someone at some

point to try to find out whether $24 million, if thatJs the
amount involved here, would have a rationale relationship to
the totality of secular education costs involved here?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am arguing here today not only on behalf of the
defendant schools who are named in the complaint,Lemon v.
Kurfcaman, but also on behalf of the Commonwealth who is

28
represented here today by the Attorney General who sits next
to me at counsel table*
And on behalf of the intervenor defendant, the
Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools, whose counsel,
a distinguished Philadelphia — a member of the Philadelphia
Bar, Mr. Henry T. Reath, is hare, and who has presented

a

brief in this case.
The appellants agree with the Commonwealth,with the
schools, with the intervenor defendant and with the Court
below, that a decree of unconstitutionality does not necessarily
have,in all cases,a retrospective effect, but rather the
answer to whether it does or does not will depend in part on
considerations of the interest of justice,and it will depend
also on whether the constitutional policy which was expressed
in the decree will be frustrated if the application is made
only prospectively.
The appellants on the first point have said there
is really no interest of justice involved so far as the
schools are concerned, and they have said secondly that the
very

voices which the Court attacked in Lemon v, Kurtaman

will be perpetuated should the Court hold and agree with the
unanimous Court below that this statute should be — that it's
decree should be applied only prospectively.
And it is these two points, namely, the question of
the interest of justice and the question of the constitutional

29
policy that I will address myself to in this argument.
Me speak of the interest of justice.

I think, Your

Honors, that we have to focus, first of all, on the holders of
that interest.
In this case, they are school people.

They are

They are people who are working with parents and

educators.

with children in Pennsylvania, in the real-life business of
being locked in a struggle against inflation and taxation and
educating 23% of the population of the Commonwealth of -- of
the school population -- of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Some 535,000 children.

Children who are being

educated in schools in the inner-city of Philadelphia, and the
large population centers of Pittsburgh and Scranton, Erie, and
who are also found in the coal regions and the rural regions
of that State,
As we look at these holders of this interest, then
we have to ask ourselves whether they were in good faith,
whether they were justified in reasonably relying upon the
continuing validity of this Act which had been passed by the
Legislature.
Whether, indeed, there were actual real legal
contracts which they had entered upon and whether they are
going to suffer hardship if the 1970-71 payments which they
have earned are now to be denied them.
1, too, feel that the chronology of events becomes

30
important in understanding this case.
As counsel has stated, the Act was passed in June
of 1968.

Inanedlately

thereafter, the Commonwealth's

Department of Education tooled up to put the Act into full
operation.
That began to occur immediately upon the passage of
the Act and by the fall,at the time of the opening of the
school year, an office to administer this Act had been set up
and paid employees of that office appointed and their work had
begun.
Indeed, counsel speaks of the regulations which
counsel's briefs tell us appeared in December of that year.
These were created in the fall of that year.
Thus, the fact that a challenge to this Act had been
announced in the press immediately upon the passage of the
Act, but no suit brought, certainly gave the administrators
of the schools reasonable reliance, at least a measure of it,
that the Act was going to remain unchallenged.
The plaintiffs had every opportunity to bring an
injunction action that very fall, because money was committed
to the program and the program was in operation at this time.
They neglected to do so.
q

When bad the Act been passed by the Legislature?
MR. BALL:

Q

In June.

In June of 1958, Mr. Justice Potter.
And

you say there was immediately announced

31
publicly that there '«as going to be an attack upon it in the
Court.
MR. BALL:

Yes, that’s correct.

And there «as full opportunity for the plaintiffs
to have brought this suit.
Q

When «as the action brought?
HR. BALL:

Q

Almost a year.
MR. BALL:

Q

The action «as brought June 3, 1969.

Almost a year.

The announcement had been made upon its adoption

that one would be brought?
MR. BALL:
Q

Yes, that is correct.

And was it the folks who announced they were going

to bring it, in fact, the ones who did bring it?
MR. BALL:

Yes, the group that announced it is one

of the plaintiffs in this case, the spokesman for an organisa­
tion known as Americans United, in a speech given in
Pittsburgh.
Counsel has said and admitted in his argument today
that the plaintiffs,in the plural, did announce this at this
time.

Thus, this was apparently with the concurrence of those

who ultimately did become all of the plaintiffs in this case.
Wow then, contracts were entered into January 15,
1969.

Why the delay if this was a true contractual situation?
In this Governmental program, as in many similar

programs, say, of the Federal Government, sometimes legislation
is passed putting a program into effect, then the people who
are going to participate in the program enter into application
relationships in anticipation of entering contracts under the
program and they then go ahead and execute the contract at
some later date.
And this is how that January 15th date gets locked
into the annual renewal of the program.
Eleven hundred and eighty-one schools entered into
contracts with the Commonwealth.
And I should like to pause here briefly to cover a
point that I don't think is essential to our case, though I
think it does add to the interest of justice, the equity
aspect of this case.
Q

Mr. Ball, when were the appropriations available?
MR. BALL:

The appropriations, under the scheme of

the Act, would not became available until the following
September.
In other words, the first payment — these are
payments by reimbursement in a typical purchase of service
situation, Mr. Chief Justice -- and the first payment would be
made for the 1968-69 school year, the first payment would be
made in September of '69.
Payments were always after the fact.
Q

Bo

I

understand that what you are saying is that,in

33

effect, in January '69, if that was it, they executed a. formal
contract that carried out informal understandings and agree­
ments that had been reached beginning with the opening of
school or before the opening of school?
MR. R&LL:

That is correct, Ms?, Chief Justice.

Just a passing word about contracts, because we do
not think that the existence of a contract is essential to our
case, though we believe it adds to the equities of our case.
The lower Court, the District Court, in its original
decision upholding the act, 310 Fed. Supp. at page 40, called
these contracts.
We have stated in our brief the Pennsylvania Law
which is applicable to these agreements and which clearly
demonstrates their contracts.
If these are not contracts, then the purchase of
service contracts which typifies all sorts of arrangements
between States and sectarian institutions of welfare and
health and care of the aged, child care, and so on, are
certainly not contracts, though they have been upheld as
contracts in case after case.
iteong these, the leading Pennsylvania case on
purchase of service from sectarian child caring institutions,
Schade v. Allegheny County Inst. Dist., which we have cited in
our brief.
Q

Mr. Ball, was anything added or any difference

did

any difference result by virtue of these contracts? Were
teachers added?

Was curriculum changed?

Anything of this

kind ?

MR,

BALL:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Under these contracts, and under the arrangement,
under the service which took place, and pursuant to the Act,
first of all, it was necessary that the sectarian schools
replace any religiously oriented textbooks which they might
have in the four subjects covered by the Act, with books which
had to have the prior approval of the State Secretary of
Education, as provided in the Act and the Regulations.
Furthermore, they had to conform their teaching
plans to the severe secularifcy requirements of the Act.

So

that in teaching these four subjects, those requireraents
would be observed.
They also had to set up separate accounting systems
according to one provision of the Act, whereby they had to
keep separate accounts related to these four subjects.
They made administrative changes obviously in the
areas pertaining to teacher certification requirements under
the Act,and also with respect to standardised testing, which
came as a new requirement to many of the schools and was
aimed at improving quality.
This Court in its opinion in Lemon v, Kurtzman, made
note of the fact that the very purpose of this program was to

35
enhance — and this this Court found was to enhance the
quality of education in the schools which were served under
the Act.
Q

Mr. Ball, that's not to suggest that the schools,

had this Act not been passed,would not have taught the four
subjects?
MR. BALL:

Ho, indeed.

And the fact that the schools now did, in some cases,
what they had been doing before, now being funded for it,
presents us a picture very, very similar to what happened un3er
Medicaid, to what happens under other kinds of purchase of
service agreements.
That is to say, the State enters into a contract
with, let us say, a sectarian child-caring institution.

It

does so — and this brings us back to a question asked by
Mr. Chief Justice Burger this morning -- it does so because
it has a public need.

The State has a need for that service.

It needs to have someone take care, let's say of dependent and
neglected children.

Sc it goes to a sectarian institution,

child-caring institution, and pays it to carry on this publicly
needed service.
The institution itself does nothing more than it
did before, but it is now aided materially in the rendering of
that service, and, indeed, it may improve the services.
We happen to know that in Pennsylvania what this Act

36

meant was that a school which had a class, le£*s say, of
70 children in a math class, could now split that into two
or three sections.
A school which had not been able to afford to have
a calculus course, could now hire a calculus teacher.
A school which had not previously had a course hi
Spanish could now institute a course in Spanish.
q

Which is to suggest then that, in fact, this enabled

expansion of faculties, at least in terms of numbers?
MB,» BALL:

Oh, indeed, it did, yes.

That is correct,

Hr. Justice Brennan.
Finally, the Act itself four tames uses the tern
•’contract" which X think is significant in terms of
Pennsylvania’s Legislature, knowing Pennsylvania's law and
what it was doing pursuant to that law.
Then June 3, 1969, the plaintiffs instituted their
casa.

The program goes into its second year.

And on November

28, 1969, the very forum selected by the plaintiffs, the
three-judge Federal Court at Philadelphia, upholds the Act as
being unconstitutional.
I could scarcely think of a greater incentive to the
schools to continue to serve under this Act.

As to the

Commonwealth, the Commonwealth had no need to have a reliance
upon the Act.

The Commonwealth was bound by the Act, bound

by the law of Pennsylvania to continue the program.

37
Thereafter, on May 15, 1970, v;he decision of this
Court in Holts v, the Tax Commission, takes place.
There was some comment during Mr. Bruton's argument
with respect to the WoIts ease.

This seemed to us as attorneys,

this decision, first of all, to uphold direct aid to religion.
This was the fact of the case, the most essential part o£ it.
It did nothing to disturb the purpose and effect test in
Allen and Allen6s careful deraarkation of the secular function
which was found to be supportable by the public in that case.
Q

At least some of the opinions in WoIts suggested

that there might be a distinction between subsidy situations
and tax exemptions.
MR. BALL:

That's perfectly true, Mr. Justice

Brennan, but the fact —
Q

Isn’t it fair to say that the Court’s opinion in-

dicated some doubt — at least doubt — about direct subsidy?
MR. BALL:

I think there can be no doubt of that,

but on balance, as we read that opinion, we felt that it did
not disturb and could not have disturbed what was already
determined by the Court in Board of Education v. Allen, where
we have a clear support with public funds of the secular
function clearly spelled out by the Court which is -- which
takes place or is offered in sectarian schools.
He were also encouraged by the fact that there was
extensive italicising by the Chief Justice in his opinion for

38
the Court:, of a timber of passage» from cases in which the
aid which had been given to sectarian education, as for
example in Alien, was heavily stressed.
Again, we had the authority of Mr. Justice Douglas
in the ifolts case who all but predicted that the Wolts
decision led directly to support fco aid to parochial, schools.
Again, we found ««
Q

That was a dissent.
MR. BALL:

That, indeed, was a dissent, but a very

authoritative dissent, if I may say so.
Q

I am sure of that.
MR. BALL:

lie also examined the concept of

entanglement in terms of, or In comparison to, the extensive
regulation of non-public schools which this Court had pointed
to in Board of Education v. Allen.

Ve did not think that the provisions with respect
to secularity, with respect to State«school relationships
contained in Act 109, added a feather*s weight to the kind of
relationship which was already considered listed in the law
and which bad been recognised by this Court.
The school administrators, both sectarian and non**
sectarian, had no complaint with respect to the administration
of this Act.

Conceivably,they would be sensitive to it.

And, again, we say no degree of relationship such as
is observed in purchase of service arrangements in the welfare

39
and health care fields.
And, thus, we think that the situation, as we came
into the '70-71 school year, was one in which this Act had
been upheld by a Court chosen by the plaintiffs*

We thought

this Act,basically, did not confront the decision of the Court
in WoIts, and, therefore, we think there was a complete basis
for a lawyer's reliance in proceeding with the contracts for
the coming year.
But we are talking here not about a lawyer's reliance
but educator's reliance, people who are in the job of
educating and whose schools desperately needed the funding
in question.
Those people and the parents who are the basic
source of support of the schools in question, and they
certainly could not have desisted from the program in
accordance with Che

ethical obligation which they have to

their constituencies.
Q

You are addressing yourself, in part at least, to

the predictability of the Court's holding on this program as
of sometime before the polling was actually rendered.
X suppose it is reasonable to assume that people
trying to make that prediction would be entitled now to look
at the fact that seme members of the Court didn't agree with
the holding.
MR. BALL:

Yea.

40
Q

I just don’t recall now the numbers in the first

Lemon"Kurfcssaan♦

There were dissenting opinions, several

dissenting opinions.
MR. BALL:

There were, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the point that I am trying to stress is this.
That if we are talking here about good faith reliance, 1 think
that we cannot impose upon either attorneys for the schools
the duties of predicting where this Court would have gone in
Lemon v. Kurfcaman, the test case.
I think, in the second place, the educators, the
people who are operating schools, and the parents, were
certainly bound to continue the program and, having before
them not a decision of this Court striking down such a program
but having before them a decision of the District Court
upholding the program.
I couldn’t imagine a better basis for reliance,and
good faith reliance.
The decision came down, finally, June 23, 1971.
The Court reraanded the case to the District Court, the
Supreme Court not attempting to spell out, to rule upon the
effect of its decision in Kurtsman.
The Court below, after full briefing and argument
unanimously, this time including Judge Hasty, held that the
effect of this decree should be prospective

only.

And

pointed to the elements of reliance and hardship which we have

41

been discussing here.
Q

Judge Hasty dissented in the first three-judge

Court.
MR. BALL:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

1 come now to the second problem that this case
poses, namely, whether the purpose served by the decree of
the Court in Lemon v. Kurfczman, namely, the prevention of
esscessive entitlement, will be frustrated if the payments
are to be made.
The Commonwealth, of course, had to make a determin­
ation that the eligibility of the schools before it could have
taken a position in Court asking that these schools be permitted
to be paid the money In question.
And, admittedly, the very activities which the Act
required the Commonwealth to go through, the inspection, the
surveillance, the audits, and what not, were precisely what
was offensive to this Court, as it reviewed the Act in question.
The price, in other words, of payment to the schools,
would be the subjecting of the schools to these various kinds
of controls and inspections and checkups which this Court
said constituted excessive entanglement between the State and
the church schools.
I’d like to focus, if we might, on precisely what
these inspections, and so on, what the requirements of the Act
were.

42

Q

Before you do, Mr* Ball, may 1 ask does payment out

of this $24 million contemplate doing tills to each of the
recipient schools?
MR. BALL:

It contemplates that it will have been

dona before the money is paid out, precisely.
Q

But you are now going to tell us it should be done

before the money is paid out, is that it?
MR. BALL:

Yes, that's right.

The Act calls for reimbursement of what it describes
as actual cost, actual cost of two tilings: teachers1 salaries,
not teachers* salaries broadly, teachers' salaries allocated
to the four subjects.

The number of hours a teacher logs in,

for example, in high school French I.
Secondly, instructional materials and textbooks,
allocated again to the four subjects.
Actual costs of these.
Kow, as to the textbooks and instructional material,
looking at it now from the point of view of entanglement,
the Act required that these be previously approved prior to
use, prior to use in the classroom, prior to any xeiiabutsement
for these books, previously approved.

And the regulations

spell that out.
The regulations say that a list of textbooks used by
participating non-public schools in programs for which payment
is sought under the Act, shall be submitted to the superintended.

of public instruction by the non-public schools*
Thereafter, the superintendent shall review each
list and will notify the non»publie school of his approval in
whole or in part of the list of textbooks, being guided by
the requirements of the Act.
So as far as textbooks and instructional materials
are concerned, these had to have been previously reviewed and
approved by the superintendent of education.
This has been discharged.
fact.

This is an accomplished

Pipent is not going to cause some State official now

to go into classrooms and to begin to examine books.
Secondly, as to teachers1 salaries, the classes
involved took place years ago, so that if it were asked were
the secularity requirements of the Act observed in the teaching
of the four subjects, one would have to say that the Cotanon»
wealth did perform that function, that this case which
Mr. Bruton cites is strong evidence of this fact, but more
important than that is the fact that there is a clearly
established presumption in the Law of Pennsylvania*

I cite

the case of Falkenberg v, Bonango Township, 297 Pennsylvania.
There was always a presumption that official acts or
duties have been properly performed.

And,in general, it is

to be presumed that everything done by an officer in connection
with the performance of an official act in the line of his
duty was legally done.

44
Now, the plaintiffs had every opportunity to rebut
that presumption.
Q

Bo you know exactly what audit procedures were

followed as to teachers’ salaries?
MR. MIL:

As to teachers' salaries?

I believe you

mean instruction —
Q

I thought you said, Mr. Ball, perhaps 1 didn’t

catch it correctly, that a teacher logged in a certain number
of hours, and then submits, I gather, or the schools submit on
their behalf a reimbursement of the amount paid out to that
teacher, isn’t that it?
MR. BAH.:

And there are two audits which then take

place.
First of all, there is an audit which neither of
us lias referred to in our briefs, but it takes place under
Pennsylvania Law.

It is an audit of the State Treasurer which

would be obvious.

That the State Treasurer would not •

certify that a certain school could be paid any money until
the State Treasurer's auditors had checked out whether these
hours had been performed, whether teacher X had taught 100
hours of freshman high school French, for example.
Q

That’s the extent of his audit?
MR. BALL:

That’s correct.

The superintendent of public instruction, now the
Secretary of Education of Pennsylvania, has the duty to ascertain

45

whether the instruction

in question, whether in the course

of the instruction in quest;Lon, the

seeularity requirements

of the Act were observed.
Q

How does he go about doing that?
MR. BALL:

That I cannot answer.

The Act requires that no religious matter be
introduced in the teaching of the four subjects.
Whatever technique

the Secretary of Education would

use to ascertain that, whether he would have an inspector,
spot‘-check classrooms, or whether he would assume that in
the absence of complaint, as we do in the public schools
with respect to Bible reading, that in the absence of complaint,
it is presumed that the teacher carried out the obligation
imposed upon him by law,
Q

Mr. Ball, we have nothing in this record to show us

what, in fact, he did?
MR. BALL:
Q

That is perfectly correct.

What about this Philadelphia — the case that

Mr. Bruton -MR, BALL:

This, of course, is not in the record

of this case.
Q

I know.
MR. BALL:

And nothing that has been said in the

brief submitted is necessarii}*- true or false.

It is a state­

ment of counsel about what's going on in another case.

46
Taking that to be true, however, as 1 do, this
evidences the fact that the Commonwealth used certain
techniques to determine whether a particular school was within
or outside of the law — of the secularity requirements of
the law.
Q

Doesn't that get us into the very problem of

entanglement?
MR. BALL:

Precisely.

It is entanglement already over.

It is entanglement

which took place.
Q

The basic point is that that is water over the dam.

Q

It was that entanglement that formed the basis of

the Court’s holding in the prior case, was it not?
MR. BALL:

Exac tly.

You see, Mr. Chief Justice, we are not here to
reargue Lemon v. Kurtzman.

I

tried to state very, very care­

fully that these offending relationships are precisely what
took place.

The fact of having to change the textbooks, to

get approval of textbooks, prior approval of textbooks and
instructional materials.

The requirement that the Secretary

of Education satisfy himself that no religious matter was
introduced in the teaching of the four subjects.
must be presumed Co have taken place.

.411 of that

The law is presumed to

have been carried out.in the very fact of the Commonwealth's
having asked the Court to make the payments to the schools, to

47
permit the payments to be made to the schools.
Q.

And you say that under Pennsylvania Law that is

presumtively correct?

Q

MR. BALL:

Yes.

we

Mr.

Bo

know,

Ball, whether there have been any

disqualifications of schools upon that kind of an audit and
a determination that they had been teaching religion?
£•&. BALL:

I am quite confident that there have

been disqualifications of schools.

The plaintiffs in their

brief say that not only this school but several other schools,
Christian Montgomery and other schools, have been disqualified.
The plaintiffs have had every opportunity
this into Court.

to bring

They certainly could have adduced evidence

to show what kind of inspections were made and whether these
*»•

- ...

.

• ‘r%

,

'

•

inspections conform to the Act and in what instances there have
been improper inspections, not enough of them, and so on.
They have never rebutted the presumption.
And I think that we cannot presume that the
Commonwealth would not carry out the law, that the Commonwealth
would behave dishonestly, any more, X think, than we can assume
that teachers and administrators in schools are not capable
of observing the law and acting as good citizens, capable of
understanding and observing the law in spite of all religious
zeal which they might have.
With respect then to all of these features, they

48
have been discharged, and these factors of entanglement can
no longer exist.
Q

I gather, Mr. Ball, those are the only two audit

operations that take place, one
MR. MLL:

of

the Treasurer —

Approval of the textbooks; secondly, the

Secretary of Education’s check-out of the teacher; thirdly,
the State Treasurer's audit; and fourthly, a post»audif.
Not? the post-audit is referred to in the Act, and it
is an audit whereby the auditor, according to the terms of the
Act, the Auditor General, examines the separate funds ad
accounts, not of the school, not of the whole school operation,
at all, separate funds and accounts pertaining to the cost of
secular educational services, which is a defined term in the
Act, the providing of services in the four subjects.
Q
a check

Is this a check on the State officials rather than
on the —
MR. BALL:

It Is a check on the check, so to speak.

In other words, let us « what takes place in the
post-audit is simply a review of the audit of the State
Treasurer.

In other words, the checks which have been paid out

are examined, examined against the allocation of time.

If

a teacher is paid $15 an hour, let us suppose, and the
record shows that she put in 60 hours.

Is the amount that she

is to be paid, or was paid, or is listed — certified by the
State Treasurer that she is to be paid — does that equal 15

49
times 60?
That’s what that audit amounts to.
In no sense, Mr, Justice Brennan, is it an
examination of the whole curriculum, or life of the school.
In no sense does it involve classroom surveillance.
I, therefore, conclude by urging the Court to
affirm the judgment below.
It is clear to us and I hope it is clear to the
Court and the interests of justice are thereby served,and
secondly, that no entanglements for the future are possible
under thp decree of the Court below.
Q

Mr. Ball, will you take just a minute and try to

get me clear on the point that Mr. Bruton was making.
As I understood him, there was a mistake in the
record as to the date the contracts were entered into.

I

think he said they were entered into January 15, 1971, for
the school year ‘70-71, and, therefore, there could have been
no reliance on the contracts, since the school year was half
over.
What is your response to that?
MR. BALL:

My response to that is that the pattern

of contracting had been established in the year 1968.

There

was a period between the enactment of Act 109 and the getting
it into operation, during which the school year, 1968-69 began.
Therefore, what was sought were applications from

50

any schools that were interested in participating in the
program- and they began to flow in.
Everyone had read the terns of the Act and knew that
they would be under contract.

The nature of the contract

could certainly be divined through a reading of the Act.,, and,
therefore, in the initial year of tooling up there was a small
lag between the beginning of September and January 15fch for
the issuing of those first contracts.
Then a program is Instituted which will obviously
be an annually-repeated program.

And each year, therefore,

this date of January 15th was carried forward, so that there
could be complete reliance not merely on the contract but,
more basically, upon the ongoing continuation of the program.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:58 o'clock, a.m., the oral
arguments in the above-entitled case were concluded.)
