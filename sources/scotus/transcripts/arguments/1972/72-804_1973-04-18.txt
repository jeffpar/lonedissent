Mr. Wallace, you laay proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ „■ f
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

This case' arises under the Federal Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1970.

For the convenience of the Court, I have

asked the clerk to distribute to each member of the Court a
pamphlet'containing the full provisions of the Clean Air Act,

f 1 amended through the 1970 amendments, plus two excerpts
from the Federal Register reproducing completely the parts
of the Administrator’s recommendations that are at issue in

this case; so that all of these provisions can be seen in
full context.
The 1970 amendments greatly strengthen the act in
■i number of ways.
first

'ii..

.blent

Among other things, the amendments .for the

provided for federally prescribed national
i:; quality standards and for federal standards for

"i'. tens from new stationary sources of pollutants.
.v. ui: quality standards apply to the presence of
. .....ta in the overall air in a community or region

The

..:•

the emission standards, also

revarrad to bo performance standards in the act, apply to the
emissions of pollutants from a single point source.
Under the 1970 amendments, each state is required
to submit a plan for implementing the national ambient air
quality standards.

And the question in this case is whether

throe plans also have to prevent 'deterioration of existing

"ox quality in any portion of any state.
b .:

The Administrator

taken the position that the act does not require or

permit him to require the states to include such a nondeterioration provision in their plans, although it preserves
the right of the states to do so, if they wish.
Respondents brought this suit for a declaratory
judgment to the contrary of the Administratorss position and
to direct the Administrator to disapprove the state plans
that have been submitted insofar as they do not prevent
significant deterioration, of existing air quality in any part
of any state.
The district court upheld the claim of the
••.ocpcv.do.ifc3 bn the basis of the act's statement of purposes
ncl on the basis of the court's view of the act's legislative
J-Sfcvry and what the court regarded as inconsistency in the
Administrator1s regulation»

•:t issued a preliminary injunction which the partie

5
affirmed , o:a the basis of
,hoi

courts s opinion® This Court granted the

'"over-:mentis petition for certiorari,

and the Government's

application for a stay, pending its decision.

Mr. Wallace, what, yon just said is something

that I have been wondering about in this case.

All that

'as issued was a preliminary injunction by the district
court.
MR. WALLACE?
Q

The parties agreed that—

And the parties agreed to consider it

something else for a limited purpose, i.e., for the purposes

of appeal.

But all that the district court ever issued was

a preliminary injunction.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

And that is all that ever has happened in this

case.
MR. WALLACE:

The parties agreed that it involved

the. controlling issue of lav? that settled the rights between
the parties.
Q
appeals.

For purposes of appeal to the court of

Then really is not the frame of the issues

here

whether or not the court was right in issuing a preliminary
injunction, not whether or not it was

right or wrong on the

merits of the case.
ME,. WALLACE:

I think not, Your Honor, because what

is the judgment of the court of
, which.Q

That opinion simply affirmed the preliminary

injunction of the district court.
Miu WALLACE:

On the basis of the district court1s

opinion as to the legal issues but on the basis- of the
submission of parties that this was the controlling legal
issue* that would govern the practice of the Administrator
and whether the Administrator could approve or disapprove the
if ate plans that are pending before it.
Q

The preliminary injunction is issued generally,

-ns we all know, on questions of probabilities and possibilities
threat;:2 of harm and how immediate and irreparable they are
■nd what not, without getting to a definitive decision of
underlying merits, and that is all that was done here, is it
not?
MR. WALLACES

The rationale of the district court's

memorandum opinion is not based on probabilities at all; it
is based on a controlling legal issue that interprets the
statute and in effect invalidates the Administrator’s
regulation.

There is nothing in that opinion adopted by

the ecurfc .of appeals- that is based on probabilities or-0

First , have the plaintiffs made a strong

showing that they, arc; likely to prevail .on the merits'?
.0

■

that he- says yes.

And

But that "is not ‘deciding the

merits..

Q

i- etitioner preached the Virginia Petroleum

bobbers type or. standards for this interim purpose,, did they
not?
MS. WALLACE: . That is-—the court said initially
this Blatter came before the court in that posture, but the—
P

Hr. Wallace, X do hot mean to interrupt you.

have a question 'when you are through answering either the
Chief Justice or Justice Stewart's question.
X am interested in the stipulation on page 3? of the
record, which X do not read quite the same way Justice
Stewart did.

lx you look at the first paragraph on page 37

of the appendix, "It is hereby stipulated by and between the

l trtien to this appeal that the decision of the district
court be regarded as a final rather than interlocutory orderon the merits," and then it sets forth the reasons for
coirig so.

That strikes me as the kind of stipulation that

counsel are not unknown to enter or do when they feel the
thing cannot possibly come out any different way on the final-/her vim they simply waive their right to a final hearing in
the district court.

I do not read that as a stipulation just

for the purposes of an appeal.
vb, WALLACE:

It was not intended as .just for the

■; /p;Dec of--

0

There could not have been an appeal, could

8
s r cr a~n X mistakau, of an interlocutory injunction

to

t?i® esirt of appeals?
MR. XRLI-XCE:

so

\

X think an injunction is appealable

as it enjoins the enforcement of a federal statute,

A tomperaxy restraining order would not have been appealable.
Q

This was a preliminary injunction.

Q

Mr. Wallace, having in mind that the court of

appeals wrote no opinion but merely acted on the district
■■■•varfc's memorandum, which I might say parenthetically they
:.o not 'very often do in an important case, can you point to
i’rything in the record her® which indicates that the court

e ?' appeals was aware that this was being treated as a
permanent disposition, a total disposition of the case?

Would you point to that for me?
MR. WALLACE*

The terms of the stipulation which

Hr. Justice Rehnquist just pointed out, plus the
o-aronclogical situation.

The preliminary injunction was

issued by the district court the day before the final day
under the statute when the administrator had to approve or
disapprove all of the state implementation plans.

The suit

brought one-, week before the statutory deadline, and the
district court had to act rapidly, and the court of appeals
garcu.d this as a matter for rapid disposition, because the
-ute specifies these very tight deadlines for implementation

he <

t,

And that is the question that had been presented

3
bhe' governing legal
ties understood the court of appeals
to be deciding on the
'

i'.-,

Is of this stipulation.

There is

be indicate that the court of appeals decided anything

else.
Ordinarily one would think that if they were
rejecting the stipulated legal issue that was before then
in deciding something else, they would have said so.

The

parties agreed what the legal issue was, and we think that
that issue was the question that is now presented in the
Government's petition for certiorari.
Q

That is not the way the district court put it.

It said, “Is there a probability of success?5'
ME, WAMACEs

And its answer was based on what the

parti.c regarded as the governing legal question.

That.is

the qu . tion we presented in our petition and the question to
•which ,r would like t© devote the remainder of my argument,
if I may.

. -•
Q

You have not suggested, for my satisfaction,

chat tie court of appeals did anything more, as Mr. Justice
Stcrwurc has just intimated, than say that in the particular
circumstances the action of the district court was not an
abuse of discretion as distinguished from whether it was right
on the ultimate legal issue.
MR. WALLACES

That is not the issue that the parties

10
■ before the court of appeals.

And

■no presumes ’.;h .1' if fchu court of appeals disagreed with the

stiptilaked L wc-h chat tie parties a aid it was deciding, it
would have indicated as ranch*

And even if the case has to

be regarded as limited in its posture to whether there was
n abuse of discretion with respect to the preliminary
injunction, our position is that the legal issue is a clear

. ns ra the face of the statute and that this Court should
decide it is that context, if it regards it as presented in
this context, which we do not regard as the context in which
it is presented.
Q

Xt seems to me that the Government's

application for a stay refers, for what it is worth, to a
final judgment.
MR. WALLACE:
C-

That is correct.

The application not only to the district

Court but, I take it, to the court of appeals.
Q

This is not a shortcut to get around this

Court net taking certified questions, is it?
MR. WALLACE;
all.

It was not regarded as a shortcut at

Wa went to the court of appeals—
.Q

■fi.'.’trict

And the court of appeals merely passed on the
rtfs -.''pinion without any opinion of their own,

■Mm. WALLACE:

Without any opinion of their own.

11

Q

So, they passed it up- to us,

MR. WALLACE:.

Well, it was not mandatory for this

;rant certiorari»

We petitioned and we presented

fro gcoorning legal question as the question presented in
i’.a petition.

We think that question is here in either

content.
The opinion of the district court, adopted by the
court of appeals, in evaluating the probability of success
or the legal issues', does not discuss any of th© operative
positions of the act, although in our view Congress in these
provisions answered with complete clarity and with great
specificity the underlying legal question that is before this
Court.

And I would like now to turn to these operative

provisions of the act in the pamphlet that has been passed
out to the Justices.

The structure of the act relevant here begins with
lection 108 on page 9 of this pamphlet, which specifies that
the Administrator is to adopt criteria for each of the
individual pollutants to be found in the ambient air, and
the Administrator has done so with respect to ail of the
.•

pollutants,

Whether additional ones will be added

regains subject to continuing review.
Section 109, an page 10, specifies that the
k'Astvcv-cr, on the basis of these criteria for
1 v\f.lotouts, then will adopt what are called the

IS
tional

ality standards,

idards are to

dnlstrator and have been adopted by
Administrator.

A national primary ambient air quality

standard defined as a standard requisite to protect the public
health and a national secondary ambient air quality standard
defined at the top of page 11 as requisite to protect the
public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects.
And public welfare is very broadly defined on page 48 of this
pamphlet in the act, Section 3Q2H, which says that all
language referring to effects on welfare includes, but is
not limited to, effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation,
man-made materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility,
and climate, damage to and deterioration of property, and
hazards to transportation as well as effects on economic
values and on personal comfort and well being.
These standards are very far-reaching and have bean
adopted.

They are not subject to collateral review in this

ease for reasons explained in our brief.

There is a

statutory provision specifying another route for review of
the standards.

So, this case was decided and should be

:'LIsd on the promise that the standards adopted by the.
lt::.::..;istrator are fully adequate to prevent in the ambient
air t:ty known Or anticipated adverse effects on health,
utott.iioR, sod all of the other factors covered in the

13
ffh.e standards thvK.seXvss are subject to continuous
raviet’ arid .••:.■ a vision by the Administrator as additional
scientific information becomes aval lab 1©.

But these are

•• bring snt standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency
'a cf the view that man? urban areas will have extreme
difficulty conforming even' to the primary standard and even
greater difficulty conforming to the secondary standard»
The key provision, for purposes of this case, is
.lection 110, entitled "Implementation Plans," and that title
is in the public law in the statutes at large»
titles are.

All of these

And that section required each state to adept

and submit a plan providing for the implementation,
%

maintenance, and enforcement of the primary standard and a
plan providing for the implementation, maintenance, and
enforcement of the secondary standard.

That is .all in 110

(a) U) .
And then 110<a) (2) specifies ‘that the Administrator
shall—the second sentence of that-—shall approve such plan
. Emitted to him or any portion thereof if he determines it
was adopted after reasonable notice and hearing and that—-and
then there are listed (a)

through (h) —eight additional

;requirements that the plan must meet.

If it meets those

. r.ght. v.acv:.:''.. m.ssits and was adopted after reasonable notice
end hearing, the act says on its face the Administrator
1' ..

ft is Tv-iisputod that none of these eight

14
i:

wintra adds e. requirement that the plan provide against
n of existing air quality other than
requirement that the primary and secondary standards' be

met. which is part, (a) .

The others are all concerned with

different subject matter and are tied in with meeting the
primary and secondary standards.
We think it significant that this provision does
not even say the Administrator shall not approve such plan
unless it meets these criteria.

It speaks in the positive,,

in the mandatory sense he shall approve it if it does meet
these standards. ' It has long been the view of the agency
that if a plan were submitted by a state, which admittedly
met all these standards, and it disapproved it, it would have
a very weak position in court if sued by that state.
did not think it could prevail in such a suit.

And it

And, of

course, the case did not arise in that context.
In addition to—I might add that there are other
:: rrtio:: a of Section 110 which reaffirm that the plans are
;l:-ap:l&menfcation plans for these federally prescribed
standards.

I refer the Court in particular to subpart (h)

there, in this list, of eight requirements, which says that
lie plan must provide for revision, in number two, "whenever
indrn'.vcrater finds on the basis of information
/r.ilab.lo to him that the plan is substantially inadequate
the national ambient air quality primary or

»

15
Conakry standard, not that it is inadequate for some other
purpose«
And the only definition of the plan in the act is
in subpart (d) on page 13 in Section 110, which says, “For
:'vposes of this act an

applicable implementation plan is

the implementation plan which has been approved under
subjection (a) or promulgated by the Administrator under
subsection (c) and which implements a national primary or
secondary ambient air qiiality standard in a state,1'
The act provides for an additional requirement,
and that is the Section 111 requirement on performance
standards for new stationary sources.

This apart from the

primary and secondary ambient air quality requirements.

And

I will not have time to go into that in any detail,. But it
is significant that the act defines standard of performance
o mean, at the beginning of Section 111, a standard for
emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of
emission limitation achievable

through the application of

tha best system of emission reduction which, taking into
account the coat of achieving such reduction, the Administrator
determines has been adequately demonstrated.
All of this indicates that there are two

<

requirements being imposed by tha act, one, the national
ambient air quality standards, and the other emission
limitation requirements which do not preclude new development

where the existi ng air quality exceeds that of tbs

And then Section 116 of the act specifies that the

free to adopt more stringent standards for the

ambient air if they care to do so.

And this, is in keeping

...1th the finding recited in Section 101(a)(3) of the act,
tha

svention and control of air pollution at its

source Is the primary responsibility of states and local
governments.
This interpretation of the act is also corroborated
by other important provisions of the act.

The entire

structure of the act looks toward these implementation plans
a:

being just what they are called, plans to implement the

primary and secondary standards.
Section 107(a) of the act, on page 8, succinctly
spell-. < at what the state's responsibility is, and again it
is to submit an implementation plan for such state which will
specify the manner in which national

primary and secondary

♦

Subpart 4 basically pre-empts the states from
fuels or fuel additives»

But this subpart capital

says that the Administrator may? however, approve a
provision regulating fuels or fuel additives in- implementation
plaivA. or promulgate an implementation plan containing such a
provision but only if he finds that the state control or
vrohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or
■'"aPir-tp oabi arc air quality standard which the plan
implements.
Q

But there is no implementation plan hare, is

•tare, that has been issued?
MR, WALLACE:

All 50 plans have been submitted to

the Administrator»
Q

I mean, he bps not issued them?

MR. WALLACE:

He has disapproved them insofar as

they do not comply with the district court order in this
csse.

But they do not contain an enforcement mechanism

nsistent with the district court’s order.
Q

The reason I ask is that down below, your office

: the Dtpaaarant of Justice took the position that this was
preeatnve

cause no plan had been promulgated.

is correct.

arguing that jurisdictional requirements we

Q

But there is no implementation plan involved

here?
MR. itfALLACEs
Honor.

There is none in this record, Your

The 50 states have submitted plans and those plans

were disapproved in the Federal Register insofar as they do
'oh comply with the district court’s order because at that
iioo the order was not stayed:,

This Court granted a stay

l?.' o'- in the context of a situation where the states would
have hod to devote resources to implementing the district
court’s order rather than to implementing the rest of the
plans which are in effect and were approved by the
%

Administrator.
So, the plans are presently in effect, except
insofar as this other question is before the Court, and the
Riminiatratof has not promulgated any substitute provisions
'o ro:ong olio jbates to devote their enforcement resources

ring that there will not be a deterioration of the

air in any portion of any state.

It is hard to believe that it

Too entire act is of one consistent piece and, as

have shown in our brief, the provision at the beginning of

The tlstory

ot

the 1970 act, which left Section, 1857

isood, is 3VK: more clear»

John Veneman, then the
*

v.ersto;-;stary of HSW, which enforced the air pollution law
c ■ diet truae, read, a statement oh behalf of Secretary Finch
and the Administration to both the Senate and House committees
considering the 1970 act.

And this statement is on pages

27 to 28 of our rod brief.
It says, "One of the express purposes of the Clean

iir hat is ’to protect and enhance the quality of the Ration’s
air resources.' Accordingly it has been and will continue to
be our view -that implementation plans that would permit

■•.•igni rleant deterioration of air quality in any area would
be in conflict with this provision of the Act."
Ws submit that is our case, that those two

sentences are on all fours with our contention; that that

The first sentence of what

That is the end of his quote of the

statuteo
Then he says> "Accordingly," based on that provision
:>f the statute, "it has been and will continue to be our

view that implementation plans that would permit significant
deterioration of air quality in any area would be in conflict
with tliie provision of the Act."
■So, what he is saying is that provision of the

Q

fas, but he is not Congress.

ME. TERRISs

Ho, he is not, your Honor, and I will

get on to what Congress’s response was.
Q

That really does not help us much more than

culling it the Clean Air Act or calling an act the Safe
Streets Act* does it?
15R. TERRISs

■ . thic nensa.

I think it does, Your Honor, at least

First o-f all, we think the language of the

t t ifatitself indicatas that a massive deterioration of

air quality was not intended by Congress, that that is not
~;r:. ,-ivte .t with "protect and enhance air quality."
have hart is that the

28

horninist ratior ceding up, the people that enforce the
»

statute, oKaing up end telling Congress a provision of
.tetuie prohibits significant deterioration „

Congress

It

itsuer that provision unchanged.
”e 'submit that when the enforcers of a statute

v-.v

fce„- Congress and say this is what this .provision means

? C Congress, although modifying almo st the whole rest of the
act doe a not touch that section, that that is at least
persuasive.

Now I will get on to what Congress though itself

n ■■id, because 1 think that is important.

Secretary Venem&n

also repeated that statement, in effect, in his own words.
In tiie hearings before the House committee,' which

was csonaidering the 1970 legislation, a witness representing
the" cha -.leal industry protested that the bill before Congress

tf r.,\3.d constitute an unqualified edict against any or every
degradation, because the standards would apply to all air
re gions that are now rural, recreational, or otherwise
unIndustrial!sed.
He therefore proposed & flexible provision for
aia-ee v-g the equity n& to each area in place of the national
•ohibitio.'a against significant deterioration.
g

-c:; statement:is on page 31 of our brief .
The committee left intact Section 1857, which

crohibiteci do fcerioration, according to the Administration

'rifcursneso

In addition, the House report, We think, clearly

adopted Congressman Rogers3 position, because it effectively
• rib tb'/i rignificsmt deterioration was prohibited by stating

x.be following:

"The war against 'air pollution will be carried

".ft throughout the nation rather than only in particular
geographical areas."

And then it went on to - say, "Effective

pollution control requires both reduction of present
pollution, and prevention of new significant pollution-

refelems “

That is almost identical with what Congressman

i t;-r.r:r■: said in response to the witness.
Let :,rte turn to the Senate report which underlies
the 1970 act.

First, it said that the statute applied

nationally and did not apply just to uniquely critical areas,

it than made clear that no state plan permitting significant
oration of air quality should be approved

1 •

firs.F. that, deterioration of air quality should not be

And that is on page 32 of our brief.
The language upon which the statement ifc based,

;• :-ion. 1 -ivy , •••fas in the 1967 act and was not changed by the

1970 statute,

Petitioner claims -that the Senate bill was

later changed before its adoption.

The only subsequent

changes in the bill after the Senate report,, and this is
basically a Senate bill, were to tighten the provisions
designed to reduce pollution in dirty air areas—in other
words, in the cities»
The tightening of controls

&s to dirty air areas

obviously cannot lead to any inference that Congress
intended to weaken the bill's provisions as to clean air
areas»
Petitioner's reply brief quotes at considerable
length summaries of the 1970 act and says that if this very
important provision were intended by Congress to apply
e.crose the country, why was it not in these congressional
pw.vpp hr of the act.

There is a simple answer to this

contention, and that is Section 1857 was not in the 1970
act.

ft was in the 19S7 act.

The 1970 statute contained

only amendments to the 1967 statute»

We submit that not only is the legis1ative history
•strongly supportive of our position but the contemporaneous
and consistent administrative interpretation until 1971 was
on 1857 prohibited significant deterioration.
Counsel has said that EPA has long said that implementation
plans could not prohibit that—that there was no requirement
that implementation plans had to prohibit significant
deterioration.
1971,

That long-standing rule goes back to August,

Xn IDS9 the National Air Pollution Control Administra­

tion, which then enforced the statute , gave the states
-guidelines for its implementation plans.
Under the heading of requirements of the Air Quality
Act, the states ware told—and this is on page 26 of our
brief—an explicit purpose of the act is to protect and
enhance the quality of the nation’s air resources.,

an f.or that purpose.

And Section

116 rpecdiioo in great detail exactly what ia required in
the plan, and that the Administrator shall approve the plan

if it meets those requirements.
The provisions that have been adopted in these

.•r'.-;.vi:.Xat.iona were adopted in two separate parts, which I
v.w flifftrihuted to the Court.

The part that was adopted in

August is fchs part that purports to specify what the plans
submitted by the state have to include, and it is
undisputed that that part did not include any requirement

!'.gainst significant deterioration.
Thu part that is at issue, distributed in April
of 1930, was not on the subject of the plans.

That was

where the national primary and secondary ambient air
ruaXifey at:arl-ards were adopted.

And the great bulb of this

the Bt-zt -yj tha right to impose requirements in-any manner ,
whether in their plans or not, th it

beyond the primary

and secondary requirements,
Part (c) is peculiarly worded, in light of this
t background.

I asked the Environmental

Protection Agency why this peculiar wording

should have been

-■'•ted in a savings provision, and they told me that it was
put in as an .accommodation to the environmental groups,
because it was known that .the. environmental. groups were
going to try to persuade the-state to adopt requirements
against any significant deterioration, and they wanted to
_< clear that the national primary and ‘ secondary standards
,:h" effect or authorising any significant

deterioration if th?-: state chose to forbid it.

That is the

z Bsso‘.r why this peculiar language was used in the savings
provision.
T1 :it » regulations are not about what the state
have to include.

They are about the. standards that

standards.
