ORAL ARGUMENT OP LAWRENCE EARL HICKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. HICKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a condemnation action to acquire the lease
hold Interest of the Almota Farmers Elevator and Warehouse
Company in a tract of land, required for the Little Goose
Lock and Dam project, a Corps of Engineers project on the

Snake River in Eastern Washington.
The fee owner, the railroad in this case, was not
joined.

For many years the OWR&M. Company had owned and

operated a railroad on the north bank of the Snake River
which ran through the little village of Almota. .
Almota Elevator Company, in 1919, went to the
railroad and they leased 0.75, 3/4ths of an acre of bare
unimproved land, absolutely nothing on it., and under various
to
consecutive leases from that day forward,/the date of taking
on May the 26th, 1967, the Almota Company continued to hold
this lease.
,.t the time of the taking they held it under a

4
20-year lease which had a terra to

Q

12th

And they had held it how long, did you say?

MR. HICKMAN;
XQtjg,

The date of taking was May the 26th,

It was to expire October* the 12th
Q

»74.

MR. HICKMAN:
Q

And how long had it been?

MR. HICKMAN;
Q

— 1974.

It had been a 20-year lease.

And had there been a lease prior to that?

MR. HICKMAN:

Oh, yes. there had been various

short-term leases;
Q

Back how far?

MR. HICKMAN:
Q

1919, that is what I wanted to know,

MR. HICKMAN:
Q

Consecutive.

Continuously.

Were they all 20-year leases 1

MR. HICKMAN:
leases.

Since 1919.

Or

-varying?

No, it started out with five-year

In fact, the 20-year lease Is the longest lease the

company ever had.

There was no

renewal

option in this •

lease.
Now, what Is actually Involved

in

the taking In this case, and If it was only this bare,
unimproved land that was involved here, we would not have any
problem because the Almota Company.is.not arguing on the

5
point that the valuation of this bare leasehold is its use
value for the length of the term remaining on the lease less
the agreed rent.

We have no argument over that.

But shortly after the company acquired this
Out
property, in 1919» they went/on the property and they built
warehouse

cn this property to handle grain

and some years afterwards, they built three crib elevators
on this property and at some time later» they put up a con­
crete tank on the property.
Now, it is all of those improvements that are
involved in what.is before the Court.
Q

What does the lease provide with respect to

those improvements at the term if the lease is not renewed?
MR. HICKMAN:

All through the period that these

improvements were- on there, these improvements, under the terrasof the lease and the treatment of the parties,were the
personal property of the Elevator Company.
Company owned

The Elevator

these improvements and it had the right to

take the improvements at the end -of .the term.

But since those

improvements were physically a part of this plant, they were
part of what the government had to take in this condemnation
action.
Now,the real problem as we see it here in this
matter is the valuation of these improvements, not the
valuation of this bare leasehold.

There is a basic difference

6
here in the duration of Almota5 s property interests in this
basic leasehold and in the improvements that is essential to
the understanding of this case.
In the leasehold it is obvious that at the end of
the term, there isn't anything there left.

There is no

property right to be valued, but the improvements at the end
of the term.
Q

Almota still owned those improvements.
Now, when you speak to the value of those

improvements, are you speaking of their current use value or
their salvage value to the lessee?
MR. HICKMAN:

I'll get to that point, Mr. Chief

Justice, in just a moment.
Q

Very well.

MR. HICKMAN:

What I am pointing out now is that

there is a difference between bare leasehold and the
improvements.

The Ninth Circuit did not appreciate that.

In

the one case, at the end of the term, all the rights are
extinguished.

In the other case, you are still the full

fee owner of these building improvements for their full
lifetime, as long as they exist.

What you do with them,

that is part of the valuation problem.
Q

Under the law of your state, are those

Improvements part of the real estate?
MR. HlOKMAN:

For the purpose of what the government

has to take, the Seagren case cited in our opening brief says

7
they are part of the real estate, but under the law of the
have .
State of Washington ~~ and we/clted authority for that — they
are the personal property of the tenant and we have a very
confusing situation here.
If the government is taking real estate, you have
got to value it as real estate and yet what the tenant
actually owns is personal property and you are going to have
to value it and his ownership continues when the lease is up.

The government has treated this as though he had no further
rights in the property at that time.
Q
enlighten me.

Well, I thought that — well* perhaps you will
Certainlys the court didn't just disregard

entirely that value.

Didn’t it give a value to those

improvements in terms of their salvage value at the termination
of the lease?
MR. HICKMAN:

That is

the argument of the government.

I would like to get an answer to that later and if I don’t, I
would appreciate going back to that again.
Q

All right, fine.

Q

Who was the trial .judge?

MR. HICKMAN:

Judge Powellss in the District Court

in Spokane,
In other words, the valuation of these, improvements
at the end of the term of the lease at the time of the taking is
vastly different than the manner of valuation of the bare

8
leasehold itself where the rights are limited by the

duration

of the term.
Q

Mr* Hickman9 there is no dispute* is there,

that upon the government * s taking, your client is obligated
to sever

the improvements, that he can’t leave them in place

and continue to use them?
MR. HICKMAN'S

The government did not own the fee at the time of

the taking.

The 0regon-Washingfcon Railroad, and Navigation

Company owned this fee.
Q

Well, they had a right to use them under the

lease for seven move years, approximatelys didn’t they?
MR. HICKMAN:

Q

That is right.

That is right.

Well, the condemnation vested full right in

the government, did it not, subject to the obligation to pay
just compensation?
MR. HICKMAN:

Yes, it

vested full right in the

leasehold and the improvements, but, mind, the government
did not condemn the rights of the fee owner.

This was still

property of the fee owner and only the fee owner* could
terminal

je and refuse to renew.

9
Q

So you say then the government could not insist,,

under the way It took the land, that you remove those
buildings?

Just because it —
MR, HICKMAN:

It had no right to insist because the

government was not acquiring the fee.
This is not like the
where

could have said
we have a legal right and at the end of the . term- you! re just
not going to stay there,
Q

Well, Mr. Hickman, I am confused, now.

You

say the government did not acquire the fee to the threefourths acre of land?
MR. HICKMAN:

Mo, the fee owner was not • «joined ill

this case and so far as I know, to this date the government
f still does not own the fee to this property.
Q

Well, I am confused as others apparently are.

What did the government —* why did it take just: the leasehold
interest then?
MR. HICKMAN:

Well, of course, it is not a part of

the record but I can inform you that

it is the policy of the

government in these relocation cases where they- relocate the
railroad

to

enter into an agreement with, the railroad and

they do not acquire the fee, they trade.

The fact of the

matter is that at the time this was done, no such agreement
existed with the railroad fact s were at the time.

This has to be considered as the

That they did not own the fee.

The

.10

railroad did. own the fee and that is very important in this
case *
Q

Yes , but what was the government — what was

the purpose for which the government was acquiring this?
MR. HICKMAN:
project.

for the Little Goose Lock and Dam

It would be flooded.
Q

Anc why would the leasehold interest be

enough for that?

MR, HICKMAN:

Well, they expected to acquire the

fees by making a deal with railroad, but they had not made
a deal yet.
Q

You mean, by a negotiated purchase?

MR. HICKMAN:
Q

That1s right.

What about trading, by making —

MR. HICKMAN:

That3s right, they relocated the

railroad higher up on a hill and went ahead.

Now, there was

not any substantial factual dispute in this ease.
Q

Mr. Hickman, Just before you proceed, if the

government had first acquired the fee, you would hardly have
any ease at all, would you, because the government then would.
have been your lessor.
MR, HICKMAN:

Your Honor, I would agree with you.

The government would have the right at the end of the term to
say, "Sorry, boys —-n
Q

Right.

11

. MR. HICKMAN: — Hw@’re not going to renew/’

But the

thing is, we have had to take the facts in this case as the
the
law. The government should not do that and in / stipulation
that is entered here — we did enter into a stipulation for
the reason that the only difference between us ultimately was:

How do you value these improvements?

So we simply got

together and we stipulated on the facts and if it was to be
/alued as determined by the government, the value was said
to be $130,000.

If it was to be valued the way we contended,

it was to be $2?4,625.
Q

And did that difference in turn, in the

valuation, depend upon Whether or not consideration was given
to the possibility of renewal of the lease?
MR. HICKMAN:

Actually it ultimately boils down to

that, but I would like to get at it in a little bit and in, a
different way, really.
on
In both cases,/both valuations, stipulated values,
if was the same property involved.

I want you to understand

that because there are some contentions in here'- .in the
argument

of

the government in the brief that would lead you

to the contrary but the stipulation was that the value of the
lend and improvements — that is/ the leasehold and improve­
ments

- - in one case was 130 ($130,000) and the value of

-ho cane thi'cr;; on the other is $270,623.
to the crux of the thing.

Now, ;we get, really,

12
And that is, the reason for this difference in
values was a difference of opinion as to what elements of
value were entitled to be considered in determining the value
of these Improvements.

There was not any argument over

this bare leasehold.
Now, the question is, what should be considered
when it comes to determining the value of these improvements?
Now, in the opening brief, we cited quite a number of cases
on the proposition that in determining the fair market value
of any property, that you must consider all elements of
value.

You must consider all reasonable probable uses of

property that affect the fair market value.
Now, they don’t disagree with that, but they
don't apply the rule.

Now, I cited the Olson case, in

which this Court here lays down in very good language exactly
what I said and I had intended to read It, but in the interests,
of saving time, I'll proceed.
Now, at this point, in determining what these
buildings could be used for and determining what the elements
of value that should be considered (are), I think you need to
pretty well understand the

structural

nature of these

facilities.
Now, I mentioned that there were three crib
buildings that were put up on the property.

If you under­

stand what a crib elevator building is, it is a wooden

13

structure.

It is made of cribbing.

You take, well., for

example2 by 12 planks said they spike one on top of the
other and you continue that type of structure clear to the
top

of the bins.
Mow, each one of these structures would hold

125,000 bushels.

That is enough to fill 62 and a half

125,000-capacity grain car

g to give you an idea of the

size of this thing.
Mow, there vie re three buildings like that.
To top that off, there was a concrete, tank which
would hold 148,000 bushels.
Ccirs

That would take 74 railroad

of the same size to fill that.
Now, you can realize and appreciate that there had

to be very substantial end permanent foundations under these
structures so, when you get to the matter here of selling
this property and determining fair market value, what is the
first and most important thing the buyer is going to ask?
He is going to ask what are the probabilities, what
are the chances of continuing to use these structures right
where they are.

Why?

Because he knows there is little or no

value whatsoever to attempt to move them, probably nothing
but junk value to try and move these buildings.

That is

where the; difference arises between the government and our­
selves in this case and that is, in Almota’s view, at that
stage of ;he case Almota has contended that there should be

taken into consideration that the probable use of these
improvements right where they were was' very great, that it
was a reasonably • robable use.
■

You will find in the

facts — in other words, it was

stipulated that there was evidence to the effect that the
railroad as a general policy never refused to renew one of
these leases where railroad traffic was being produced for
the railroad.
Q

VJhat if the railroad, somewhere toward the

end of the seven years remaining in the leaseP decided for
their own reasons to move the tracks to high ground, as in
case of flooding or move it anywhere else?
MR. HICKMAN:

Your Honor, that Is one of the risks

that any buyer takes.
Q

Well, the buyer, or. t^e __

MR. HICKMAN:

You might Improve property, for

crumple, and you take the risk that the party -between you and
the view might build a high-rise apartment.
Q

Isn’t that a risk?

MR. HICKMAN:• It’s a risk, yes.
Q

Isn’t that a risk-that your client took when,

he built the property on that land under that lease?
MR. HICKMAN:

Yes, but the thing is

your Honor,

government hare would have this valued £ ;': though it was
c«rt&3 nty- that it is not . going to be renewed

that
We say that it was reasonably probable/it would

the term.

be renewed at the end of the term and that that is an element
of value that is considered by the market and should be
taken into consideration in this case and with the stipulation,
that was actually the case because that is the only difference
between the two values.

The government recognises that the

market was valuing this probability of renewal at approximately
$lM,625 because that is the only difference between the
two values.

They recognised that if you let a buyer use

his own devices in determining for himself what the
probabilities of renewal were that he finally in hardnosed
bargaining

would come up and say, «okay , it is worth

$27*1,625. "
Q

If the lease had had in It a clause that

automatically terminated the lease if the property were
condemned?
MR. HICKMAN:

You are talking of a problem there,

your Honor, that does not apply in this case.

There was no

condemnation clause in the lease and Almota in this ease, by
is entitled to the full value of these structures, whatever
it may be.

Now
Q

Mr. Hickman, did I understand you correctly

to say that at the time of the commencement of the condemnation
case the railroad;

still owned the fee?

.IK. HICKMAN:

That is absolutely correct, your

16
Honor.

Now* there has been some remarks made In the briefs

that would lead you to the contrary.
Q

1 have before me, I think, the opinion of the

Circuit Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit which says,
"Prior to the commencement of the condemnation action under
review, the United States had settled with the fee owner,
the railroad, for the railroad's interest in the land In
question."
MR. HICKMAN:

I realize that that is in the opinion

and there had been some contention of that type in some of
the briefs.

There is absolutely no truth to it.

That is an

erroneous conclusion on the part of the trial court and the
only answer — I mean, of the Ninth Circuit Court -- the
only answer .1 can come up with was that there was a footnote
to that effect in one of the government briefs'. . No citation
has ever been made to anything in the record that that is
true and it actually is not factual*
X have mentioned to you.
Q

That .did not happen as

They don’t yet own

Mr. Hickman, is the record

the fee.

silent on this

issue?
MR. HICKMAN:

It is.

It is but It was tried in the

trial court on the basis that the railroad owned this
property and the government did not.

The government is

absolutely not in a position in this case to have held cut
till 197^ and then said, "Gentlemen, we are not renewing.

17
Take your elevator and go.” And yet, that is what - they would

result at the end of the tern.

We say that is lor the market

to determine what the probabilities are of that happening.
Q

Well, had the government acquired the fee either

by condemnatio::! or negotiation» it would hare» boon certain
that the lease would not have been renewed.
MR. HICKMAN:

Well, now, except for this, your

Honor, and that is I don’t think It is exactly the law,
it isn’t in here and I haven’t argued.Iou know,
ask

for compensation, we can’t ask for the

the project In value.
Q

Right.

MR. HICKMAN: And the trial judge was of the
the
opinion that/government can’t assert the government to Its
detriment $,either.
Q

I think that Is correct.

MR. HICKMAN':

In other words, that they have got to

take the title as it was at the time you are taking this and
at that time the government didn’t own it.
Mow, you see, where this renewal of the lease
comes in, it isn’t really

renewal of the lease.

It comes in

in determining what the probabilities are that at the end of

where It is.

If it can continue to be used there, it is

If it can’t be, it is probably nothing but

■u here, all the government would give us i...

I am pointing out'that in the Car lock -case, the
Court has held that you can get that without owning it.
Now, all the government would give no in addition
in this case to what the party in the Carlock c'as.e got, who
dn’t own the improvements, is that they would give us this
junk value for these improvements.

MR. HICKMAN:

The concrete tank was put up about

Q

The most expensive piece. I suppose, is the

concrete tank?
MR.. HICKMAN:
Q

Not necessarily.

Not necessarily.

But it is the one on which you have the least-

MR. HICKMAN:
Q

Well, there is no salvage to that.

MR. HICKMAN:

Really not.

When you start tearing

20
Q

Is this perhaps the explanation why the

earlier leases were five years

for example and the final

lease is 20?
MR, HI--JKMAN:

I think not, your Honor.

It is

simply the policy of the railroad to rant to control these
properties to assure that there is a freight going to the
railroad.
Q

Would a prudent businessman in 1954 go to the
that
expense of building / concrete tank if he had only a fiveyear lease?
MR. HICKMAN:

Your Honor, that Is just a point I

A prudent businessman and you have got to

assume that a prudent buyer — 'you have got to assume that the
government In agreeing to this $2?4,0Q0 valuation was
considering the prudent buyer willing to pay that, they have
mltted that buyers on the market, if you left them to
■heir own devices would let them examine all of this.

It would

have come up at 'that figure.

driving at* . .
Would a prudent; man build an expensive concrete

something more than that?
MS. HICKMAN:

Ks would want something more thjan

21
that,
Q

So he got a 20-year- lease the last time?

MR. iilOjfeMAN:
tl

He would do it with the railroad

type of leases that were being written and it; is done

ruite regularly..

It is not uncommon at all and the reason i®,

.he railroads are after freight traffic and they if ill
continue renewing those leases time after time without any
question and that is why the market makes a difference of
$144,625.

If this was so speculative and so uncertains the

market would have said® ‘’Well, we* 11 give you $1,000 more,8*
,nd that is all.

But this thing, there is more than twice the

difference in value between the government's contention and
our own in this case.
Q

Mr. Hickman, it may he of no consequence, but

.■he annual rental under the lease was $114.20, a year?
MR. HICKMAN:

That is right.

Had. it always been/that figure?

MR, HICKMAN:

It had never been more than that.

MR. HICKMAN:

Q

A .typical nominal railroad lease?

MR., HICKMAN:

That's right.

That's right.

The

railroad saves these properties for just thi3 purpose and
• lis;;- continue to lease them.

The only thing they want

22
control of is that if the lessee goes to doing business with
someone else and does not produce any more freight traffic,
then they had better watch out.
I want to call attention that the government

has

gone against the unit rule cases and. they are against and in
conflict with the Second Circuit cases.

Tbs Washington, D.C,

circuit case in our opinion is in line with the Second
Circuit, although it doesn’t specifically so state and they
8,re also in convllct with a statute of Congress • that was
enacted in the first part of 1971 which now recognizes that
just compensation is more than what the government is
arguing in this case and by policy of the Congress now, that
in this case they would award full value if those
improvements add to the whole value of the property.
I should like to save the rest of my'time, if
you please.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Hickman.

Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT FRIZZELL, ESQ. 3
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRIZZELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courtt
I should like to discuss two or three, essential
matters with you if I may.

First, let us establish that if

v.'c were to adopt Appellant’s position and viewpoint urged

upon U33 it wil-1 necessarily and clearly dictate and require
that this Court overrule the established, law of Just
compensation as set forth 26 years ago by this Court in the
United States versus Petty Motor Company.
Secondly, I'd like to share with you why the rule*
as enunciated in Petty is the proper rule and thereby why it
should not be set aside and overruled, and,
Lastly, I’d like to deal with some of the specific
arguments and questions raised by the Petitioner, Alraota.
Let us turn our attention, if we may then, to the
pwingd states _ vars-ixs ?e;tty lector Company case, cited in our
brief.

This Court, in Petty, held that a tenant’s

expectancy

that £ts leaseholds would be renewed upon

expiration even though its lease did not provide for
renewal — is not a compensable element of

value under

the Fifth Amendment,
The Court further held that each tenant in that
case was entitled to compensation measured solely on the
basis of the remainder of its terra, which existed after its
ouster.
This Court said the fact that some tenants have
occupied the leaseholds by mutual consent for long periods
of years does not add to their rights.
How, the cuestion. arises, is Petty binding in this
case or is it distinguishable?

Petitioner contends that it

is distinguishable and therefore is not binding.
I submit that the Petty Motor case is directly in
point despite the efforts of the Petitioners to distinguish
it.

In substance3 the facts are the same.

The

difference

That difference is as followsj

case had no improvements considered part of the fee as is
present in the instant case,”

But that does not change the

They are identical.

This Court in Petty held that the possibility of
. -.vnewal is not a convinoeable element and made, clear that this
was because such a prospect of renewal expectancy does not
add to the tenants’ rights, with or- without improvements.

plus the value of the right to renew the lease of Petty less
the agreed rent which the tenant would pay for 'such use and

When the Court used the language, ,!The right to

right which is a legal right enforceable under some option?
MR. FRIZZELL;

E?Mor allowed that

mere expectancy to rise to the level of a legal property

Let’s turn our attention, because I

,/

'think it is ■ - logical question and a logical lab frost to
bake and that is, how does the government Justify the
Petitioner in this instance getting something less than the

$274*000,

In fact, tho Petitioner repeats that in Ms brief

several times.

He says anything less than that is not just

compensation under the Fifth Amendment»
WellB first of all, let me point out that $130,000
«

of that $274,000 represents compensation to the Petitioner
for its remaining seven and a half years under the lease.
Now, the reason the Petitioner gets less than the
$274,000 is because the remaining $144,625 is not part of
the value of the leasehold owned by the Petitioner and
condemned by the government.

That much of the $274,000

represents the value the Petitioner desires to add on,
based on the mere expectancy, i.e., renewal of its lease, a
nonproperty expectation and, I hasten to add that the lease -~
that the lease would be renewed.
If the government were to pay Almota for such
expectancy, vre would be acquiescing in their’attempt to
convert a nonproperty interest .into a compensable item.
Why should the government be put in a different
position than any other private fee owner that would have
acquired the fee in this instance?

Why should we be required

to pay more than the United States Steel or G.E., had they
acquired the railroad fee here?

What would have happened

if they would have acquired rather than the government?

have got to remember that the government, under the case law,

to the railroad and obtained a new 20-year lease and you

MR, FRIZZELL:

Had they, in fact, acquired more

than a seven and a half year lease — 20-year, whatever, we
would have had to pay them for their legal interest in the
property condemned, the leasehold interest, but not any
expectancy.
Q

*
Would that necessarily be true if they

acquired that 20-year extension after

notice of the

taking?
MR. FRIZZELL:

No, that would not be true in that

event because the compensation to be paid is as of the date

To su swera question that came up earlier, what

Let me back up, Mr. Frizzell.

On May 26, 1967,

MR,. FRIZZELL:

Q

Yes.

That is of record and In this record.

■MR. FRIZZELL;

Indeed it is

Q

So as of that date* the title passed?

MR. FRIZZELL:

As between Petitioner and the

govornmentye s.
Q

The leasehold interest, whatever its value,

passed to the government.
MR, FRIZZELL:

Whatever it is, whatever its value

is, passed to the government as of May of 19673 leaving a
remaining approximately seven and one half year terra, for the
government to compensate Petitioner for under his original
20-year lease, dating back to 1954 and expiring in 1974.
I think on© other point that the Petitioner made
should be cleared up at this time and that is his statement
that the government is only, in essence, allowing junk
value for these improvements.

I refer you to our brief, but

let me point out again that the value of the improvements
at the end of the term of this lease is not any longer an
issue in this case.

Why?

Because, by stipulation here again

a lot was stipulated to in this case.

One of those stipula­

tions was that the right of removal, under the lease, was
revested by the government in Petitioner, giving him the
exact same rights he

had under the original lease with the

railroad and giving him ample time to remove the improvements
I think, in conclusion — yes?
Q

Well, I understand his position is that,

practically., you cannot remove them, except as junk.

35

MR,. FRIZZELL:

I would, submit that that would

. . uerally be true with most permanent type of improvements
after 13 years since they *re — well* these were erected in
19^0, some of them, I think he said.

After approximately

20-some years the removal right Is somewhat of an empty
gesture.
Q

Yes, it may be even a code word for the

government saying that we will insist that you get them off,
MR. FRIZZELL:

This lease provided, by"the way,

:hat if the Petitioner did not remove them, that the railroad
had the right to do so and charge Petitioner,
Q

And you could do the same?

MR.' FRIZZELL:

Yes, as we accede to the rights of

the fee railroad owner.
Q

Mr. Frizzellj do you think there is any basic

inconsistency between the Ninth Circuit decisions in this
case and in the Fuller case, the preceding one?
MR, FRIZZELL:

Well, I disagree with the Ninth

Circuit decision in the Fuller case but, of course, as you
well know, since it has just been argued, that is different
to the extent that in that instance the expectancy was
based on a license revocable by the government whereas in
this instance- there was no renewal right in the lease, but
a -mere expectancy that Petitioner desires to rise to the
level of a legal interest in the lease and therefore be

compensated.
I would llice to conclude, and I can think of no.
•'acre fitting conclusions for argument in this case than the
words of Mr. Justice Douglas concurring in part in United
States versus General Motors Company.

At that time he stated

"Consequential losses or injuries resulting from the taking
are not compensable under the Fifth Amendment.

If we allow

consequential damages to be shown here and awarded here, I
do not see why almost any type might not be in the future.
”If we take that step, we demonstrate.that hard
cases do indeed make bad law.

We give the Constitution an

interpretation which promises swollen verdicts which no act o
Congress can cure.”
Q

What type of damages were being referred to

under the head of"consequential” damages in Mr. Justice
Douglas’ opinion there?
MR. FRIZZELL:

That was an instance where General

Motors Corporation desired to remove leasehold improvements
in the matter of machinery and buildings.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE EARL HICKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF
MR. HICKMAN;

THE

PETITIONERS'

Mr. Chief Justice, about the Petty

case, we have dealt with that at length

in the briefs and

37
if reference ia made to that, 1 think that the matter is
fully answered, but again I repeat, in the Petty case, there

was only the bare leasehold, the value in that case.
anas no tenant-owned building improvements.

There

The Court did

not purport to be talking about tenant-owned building
improvements in any sense whatsoever*
Alsoa 1 would like to point this out, that Counsel
and in the briefs has argued at great length about this
matter of property rights.

The only property rights we

are

really talking about in this case is the bare leasehold
about which we have no disagreement arid the building improve
merits and machinery that we are disagreeing about.
There is no property right that we are claiming in
the leasehold expectancy.

We have not asked for payment of

a property right in the leasehold expectancy.
What we do say is that in the valuation of those
building improvements, that we are entitled to the considera­
tion of all elements that lend
upon the market.

value to those improvements

We are entitled to the consideration of all

reasonably probable uses of that property.
Q

'Isn't that seven or seven and a half years*use?

MR. HICKMAH:

Oh, but that is not limited by the

.even and. a half years because, as I have pointed out, at
the end of the seven and a half years we still own these
owildings.

What are they worth then?

Counsel would have

38
them worth nothing.
Q

Well, that is what you said earlier,

dldn51 you?
I said that If you took their view,

MR. HICKMAN:

they would be worth nothing.

Under our view, considering all

elements of value and the fact that in all probability they
could continue to be used in place, they have great value.
Q

Because of the probability of renewal?

MR. HICKMAN;

Because of the probability of

continuing to use them right where they are.

What are you

going to use those buildings for at the end of the term?
Counsel would say there is only one use you can consider
that is to tear them down and remove them but the market
aays, look, there Is a reasonable probability that we can
use them right where we are.

This Court in the Olson case has

said, "All- reasonable probabilities are to be taken into
consideration, *

The Court says, "In making that estimate,

there should be taken Into account all considerations that
might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial
weight in such bargaining."
Now, the government by their viei<f *says, "We'll
take everything into consideration but this one element,
which valves at $144,625.
Q

You have got to exclude that."

Isn't that quotation you read, from directed

imarily at the highest and best use concept?

39
MR. HICKMAN:

Wall, corning to the highest and best

use concepts, what is the highest and best use of this
particular elevator at the end of the term?
where it isa isn't it?

To use it right

And there is a reasonable probability

of using it there.
Q

Well — well, go ahead, I am sorry.

MR. HICKMAN:

And the Second Circuit says, HWe don't-

care what the probabilities are.

It is not just compensation

to pay these people off at junk or salvage value on this
property because there is other things that enter-into this,
just common decency on the part of the landlord.

The fellow

that has got the lease has got the inside track' and .if it
adds value upon the market, it should be paid for, and that
is our point.

This is an element of value.

We have never

contended that as a property right we are entitled to a single
dime for this leasehold expectancy,
Q

Under your theory, Mr. Hickman, could a witness

testify at the condemnate-evaluation hearing that your
client had had a

falling but with the railroad and therefore

in this particular case it was very unlikely that the lease
would be renewed?
MR. HICKMAN:

1 suppose it would be pertinent,

.-■waver, we could point out that the railroad was perfectly
willing to taka on some other client we might sell to and
give him a lease .renewal.

iJG
Q

Yes., but what if She United States puts on a

witness and says, ”We are going to take the fee,, obviously,
and we will guarantee we will not renew it at the end of
seven years?”
MR. HICKMAN:

Gentlemen of the Court, if you feel,

in this case, that this matter of whether the governmentowned the fee in this or did not own it is the crux of this
case, then this case should be remanded to try that matter of
fact in the trial court.

That was never tried.

It was never

argued In the trial court and in this case if they repeat that
that was the case, we will certainly contest that matter,
because we have plenty, I am sure, of evidence that this fee
was - in the railroad yet and there was no agreement.

What X

knew about it is outside the record but if that is in your
minds, this should be remanded to find out what the fact is.
It should not now be decided on that fact.

Honor's that if the government had owned this all the time

Q

That is what Justice White was suggesting to

you, wasn’t he* in his question?
MR. HICKMAN;

Well, then the thing is, there would

be no probability of a renewal, would there?

In our case we

are simply asking, let the market judge the probability of

Doss the record show whether or not this particular

MR. HICKMAN;

The record is silent cn that but for

what benefit it may be to you, I am quite sure that the
reason for the taking was that the flooding line would be so
close to the foundations of the elevators that they would not
