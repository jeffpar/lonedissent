MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 71-900, Union Oil Company against the Tugboat
Company.
Mr. Roberts, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH E. ROBERTS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

this Honorable Court:
This case involves a collision that occured on
Christmas Eve in 1967, 24th of December 1967, at about 8:30,
p.m. on the Columbia River, which flows, as you know, between
the States of Oregon and Washington.
My client, Union Oil Company, was the bayable
charter of the tanker, SANTA MARIA.

The SANTA MARIA was

approximately 550 feet long, and she had a gross tonnage
of about 11,000.

She was loaded with 17,000 gallons of

petroleum products, and was inbound from the Pacific Coast
to Portland, Oregon.

She is an American flag vessel.

At Astoria, Oregon, she took aboard a Columbia
River pilot, Mr. McDonald Kabels, who has been going to sea
on the Columbia River as a tugboat man, and so forth, since
1928.

was experiences near the town or the

inlet of Skimockaway,

which is on the Washington side of the Columbia River, but
pretty close to its mouth.
The chief mate of the vessel was Hr. Essland, and
he testified that you always find a little fog at Skimockaway
at that time of the year.
The vessel proceeded on, mainly on a full bell, but
for maneuvering speed in the river, which is about 11 to 12
knots.
There was a vessel that was inbound called the
TEAKWOOD under the command of Captain Faith,who was also a
Columbia River pilot.
The pilots at that time were communicating with one
another by a walky-talky machine, and they conversed about the
traffic on the river and the conditions, and so forth.
Captain Kabels, through this walky-talky communica­
tion, was aware that there was a tugging barge bound downstream
on the Columbia River from Rainier, Oregon.
How this tug was the SAN JACINTO owned and operated —
Q

What was the current of the river, about?

Do

you know ?
MR. ROBERTS:

Just about a knot, I think, according

to the -- and downstream, as I recollect from the evidence.

5
But 1 don't think it had any significance as far as the
collision was concerned.
The SAN JACINTO was owned and operated by
Star and Crescent, had a completely inexperienced crew aboard.
None of the wen had any papers, as such.

The master, I

think,it was either his first or second trip.

And towed by

the SAN JACINTO was this big barge called the OLIVER J.
OLSON, III, which was fully loaded with lumber above the deck
about two or three tiers high, and the lumber had been loaded
at Rainier.
Now, the tugboat was towing on a 250 cable.

The

barge, I think, was about 300 — 250 to 300 — feet in
length.
Now, downstream at the same time or about this
time, was Captain Olson, another Columbia River pilot who
was piloting the PACIFIC TELSTAR,

He was also in communica­

tion with Captain Kabels on the SANTA MARIA by walky-talky
and he advised that he had passed the tug and barge.

He

also advised there was a little, what they cell, toolle'fog,
at this time.
Now, this is fog that kind of hangs down towards
the water, and it was mainly on the Washington side.
patchy.

It wa3

The pilots all had testified it had aot impeded the

traffic on the river, as demonstrated by the evidence in any
way, and that it was to be expected at this time of the year.

o

The toolie feg, I think9 the best way to describe it
if you have a fairly large vessel you probably can see the
top of the mast, but you could not see the null, and it was
all -- or patchy parts of it — were ail over on the Washingtor
side of the river.
Now, X think it important to visualise the scene
of this particular chasm.

This is a narrow channel and one

of the exhibits which was introduced into the evidence shows
the channel itself.
This is just a blowup of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey chart, and the accident occurred right here at buouy
No. 70.
Be Griegs Channel, right at the scene of the
collision, is 500 feet wide.

The actual river at this point

which is maneuverable, at least as far as Ipig vessels are
concerned, or vessels with a large draft -- and, by the way,
the SANTA MARIR was drawing 31 feet at the stern — is about
800 feet wide, although going from the Oregon to the Washington
shore or over to Wallace Island is about 1500 feet, but of
that amount there is over 800 feet that is a shoal, just to
the north side,there, of Wallace Island.
Now, there Is no doubt in my opinion that the
evidence clearly demonstrates that the pilots all knew about
the tug and barge.

Captain Kabels had seen her visually,

and he had seen her on radar.

The other pilots had seen the

7
tug and barge visually and on radar.
Now, at or about this Cooper Point and Waterford
area, which are two lights on the Washington side of the
river9 there was some of this toolie fog, and there was a
patch —
Q

How do you spell toolie?

MR. ROBERTS:

T-o~o-*l-i-e.

That’s phonetically.

I never heard it before but this is what the natives were
saying, it was toolie fog.
The tugboat was navigating by following the trees
on the bank of the Washington side of the river, and you will
note on the exhibit, the chart that 1 have shown that the
river turns a little and the pilots navigate on range lights
and on courses at this particular point on the entire length
of the Columbia River.
Q

Does the record show the frequency of

tankers of this size, draft and length?
MR. ROBERTS:

Nothing at all in the record.

The vessel, and

I

think counsel will admit,

opposing counsel, it is not unusual for the Columoia River.
In fact, they have had a lot bigger vessels and a number of
tankers come in on a periodic visit all the time from the
refineries in the California area and Washington.
So it is not an unusual vessel by any means.
fact, as I have indicated, Captain Kabels had been on it

In

8
eleven or twelve times.
Q

Incidentally — or does the record show what

the SANTA MARIA1s bearer steerage way is?
MR. ROBERTS:
Q

Pardon?

Does the record show what the slowest speed

the SANTA MARIA must possess in order to maintain —
MR. ROBERTS:

There is nothing in the record,

although the Chief Mate, Mr. Asplin, testified that as to
maneuvering speed in the river full speed ahead was 11 to
12 knots and half speed ahead was about 7 to 8 and show ahead
was 5 to 6.
Now, just prior —
Q

Wasn't there something in the record that

they had difficulty maintaining steerage at 5 or 6 or below?
MR. ROBERTS:

The master— the helmsman had

testified, and I think it is on page 73 of the record:
"Q

What did you do after the Blowdown?

"A

The Quartermaster, he said he wasn't steering,

so I went back to half speed which is 40 revolutions for
steering."
That's in the record.
Q

Well, are you by that statement^ indicating

that half speed is the necessary speed?
MR. ROBERTS:

Under these circumstances the —

I think to be perfectly honest and frank about it the record

9
would indicate that at this draft of 31 feet and fully
loaded the vessel would be what they call "smelling the
bottom."

And it is pretty hard to steer at a low rate of

speed.
So my position is that 7 to 8, under these
circumstances, was more than justified and reasonable.
Now, there is evidence in the record to the
effect that once you are on slow speed and are continuing
for any length of time you do maintain steerage weight, but
I don't think it was in relation to a vessel in these
inland waters.

Secondly, I do not believe that that took into

consideration the fact that the pilot was changing courses
all the time coming up the Columbia River and, therefore,
when he wa3 changing course it was necessary that he be on
half ahead rather than slow ahead.
Q

What is the depth of the channel?

MR. ROBERTS:
I think, at this

It is not a very deep river.

The Corps of

Engineers dredge it at all times and there is some appropri­
ation to widen — deepen the depths of the Columbia River.
Q

It is a tidal river, isn't it?

MR. ROBERTS:

No, I don't think the tide comes

all the way up, by any means.

That is shown by the

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 o’clock
(Same appearances as heretofore noted.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Roberts, you may

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You could win on all

he

facts of this case and not win if you —
MR. ROBERTS:

I will get to the legal issues —

I will clear up the record.
The publications indicate the dredge depth of the
channel is from 35 to 40 feet beyond the engineer's like to
maintain it.
The issues before this Court arise out of the fact
that the trial judge found the tug and barge solely at fault
for this collision, and said that the evidence was over­
whelming for such a decision.
The case was appealed by the tug and barge to the
9th Circuit on one ground and that was that the barge

—

pardon me, the SANTA MARIA going at about 7 knots consti­
tuted a violation of the speed in fog rule,which is Rule 16,
which requires a vessel to go at a moderate speed when
traveling in fog, rain and so forth.
The 9th Circuit, under the ruling in the SILVER
PALM, a 9th Circuit decision, interprets the words "modi erate

12
speed in fog" to mean that a vessel apparently must stop
within half the distance that you can see ahead.

And in this

case the 9th Circuit reasoned that the distance was prooably
about 900 feet, although I don’t think there is any evidence
in the record to substantiate that, and, therefore, the
SANTA MARIA should have stopped within 450 feet and, of
course, this is impossible at the speeed of 7 knots that it
was traveling.
We take the position on this appeal that this is
in conflict with other circuit decisions, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and
in particular, with the 5th Circuit's decision in the Hess
case, where that rule, Article 16, moderate speed was in­
terpreted Co mean taking into consideration all of the
circumstances surrounding Che location of Che collision and
Che circumstances leading to Che collision Itself.
In this case, we feel Chat the evidence justifies
an adoption of the rule of the majority of the circuits that
moderate speed cannot be interpreted Co mean half the dis­
tance ahead hut that Che prior of the facts must determine,
based on all of the circumstances then prevailing, as to
whether a vessel was or was not going at moderate speed so
to come within Rule 16.
In this case, we feel the evidence very clearly
showed that in determining that the vessel was going at
moderate speed the trial judge, in effect, found that there

13
was no probability at all of the tug and barge crossing this
narrow channel and making a U-turn in the channel itself
and that the SANTA MARIA was on her own extreme side of the
channels the fog was patchy,

It was a toolie type fog.

It wasn’t fog all the time on the voyage, and other vessels
were navigating the Columbia River at that particular time.
The vessel was in the charge of a very, very
experienced Columbia River pilot who had knowledge of the
river -- intimate knowledge of the river -- and other
pilots had indicated at the time that the fog conditions
were such that it didn’t prevent vessels navigating the
Columbia River.
Q

Do you think the rule that your attacking

in this case is any different from the Rule of Sight?
MR. ROBERTS;

No, I don’t think it is.

The Buie

of Sight, 1 think, is the same as the half distance rule.
The evidence, Your Honor, indicates in this case
that we saw the tug and barge on radar and the third mate
on the bridge saw it the whole time in his binocui
Q

Well, anyway, you think the — do you think

the rule the other circuits are applying is a different
rule than is applied in the 9th Circuit?
MR. ROBERTS;

Q

I do.

And the other circuits then are not applying

the Rile of S ^ght?

14
MR. ROBERTS:

No, they are applying the rule of

reasonable speed under all of the circumstances.
Q

Hox* about your opponents contention that

the Rule of Sight was approved by this Court in The Umbria?
MR. ROBERTS:
in

Umbria.

I don't think the Court said that

That's the point.

We take the position that

the 9th Circuit in The Silver Palm misconstrued.
The Umbria is a very interesting factual case.
In that case, you had the contention of speed on the part of
the one vessel, but the outcome of that case was that The
Umbria was held solely at fault even though there was speed
in that case because -~
Q

What about the standard they applied in

judging liability?

Was it the Rule of Sight or no?

MR. ROBERTS:
was the Rule of Sight.

In The Umbria case, I don't think it
At least I don't read it that way,

Tour Honor.
We are of the opinion that Hie Silver Palm, in
effect, caught In straight jackets the pilot and the man
conducting the vessel.

He has to take out a slide rule, in

effect.
Under these circumstances, the vessel -- the tug
and barge disappear into the fog.

It is just a small patch

of fog, and suddenly the barge and the tug make a U-t’urn
directly in front of the tanker in this narrow channel.

15
The only way,in my opinion, Che facts show that
this particular incident could have been avoided was for the
vessel to have anchored at any sign of fog whatsoever.
And I really believe that the decisions of the other circuits
where they take into consideration all of the circumstances
in determining reasonable or moderate speed.
Mow, Judge Wright in the 9th Circuit just went on
speed alone in reversing and holding mutual fault in this
case.

And the history of the Rule 16 and the way it has

been interpreted by other circuits is to the effect that you
cannot just say such and such a speed is not moderate.

You

have got to take into consideration all of the circumstances
of prevailing at or at the time of the collision.
Also, in this case, where the evidence is that
•

V

the tugboat — that the barge and tug came out of the
fog and the SANTA MARIA could actually see ahead a mile and
a half to two miles, where do the distances run from?

Do

they run from the edge of the fogbank or do they run from
immediately ahead of the vessel?
Judge Wright says from the edge of the fogbank.
I feel that under these circumstances the master
is put into a straight-jacket.
cumstances, had no alternative.

The pilot, under these cir­
He has no judgment to

exercise or discretion to exercise.

As soon as he sees

anything like fog or reduced visibility he must anchor the

16

vessel.
1 don't Chink this is a reasonable inference to
be taken from that particular language in Rule 16.
Obviously,

if this case had gone up in the 3th

Circuit, it would have been affirmed, in my opinion, based
on the Hess Voyager case, and their interpretation of Rule 16
Q

What you are saying, really, is that in ail

of the circumstances shown here, the master and the pilot of
the tanker have virtually an absolute right to assume that
there wasn’t going to be a U-turn by this tugboat and its
tow.
MR. ROBERTS:
Mr. Chief Justice.

That’s exactly what I am saying,

It -- the analogy --it sounds maybe not

too good an analogy -- you are driving down Che highway at
a reasonable rate of speed and somebody turns in front of you
The Court

in the Maritime case says that we have

the right to rely that this vessel, the tug and barge, will
obey the law and not make this abrupt U-turn.
Q

But in the analogy you give if the automobile

not engaged in any turn Is going 60 miles an hour in a 30
mile zone, where would you be?
MR. ROBERTS:

Then there is under automobile law

a pritna-facie case of negligence per se. but under these
circumstances, I think, where you take into consideration
th? steerage-way of the vessel, the testimony of the helmsmen

17
and also the quartermaster and the pilot, 1 think, and the
visibility that was prevailing, other vessels traversing
this Columbia Elver, under all these circumstances 6 to 7
knots is not sufficient to show fault on the part of the
SANTA MARIA.
I just think that the mathematical rule of half
the distance ahead is just unworkable; in fact, in any sort
of a speed situation case, you are going to have fault on
the part of the other vessel because he can't come along
under the Pennsylvania rule and show that speed could not
possibly have had anything to do with it.
It just seems to be inequitable and the justice
of the situation, in my opinion, cries out for some remedy
to avoid the consequences of this 9th Circuit Silver Palm
half a head distance rule.
Now if the Court gets to the question that was
raised secondly in this case as to the division of damages,
again, Judge Wright in reversing said this is mutual fault
and therefore both vessels share the damage on a 50-50 basis.
Q

Did you raise this second question in the

Court of Appeals?
MR. ROBERTS;
Mr. Justice Potter.
never anticipated it.
time.

No, there was no reason to raise it,

We won the case in the trial and we
So you have raised it for the first

Q

I suppose you anticipated the possibility

of a reversal and 1 just wondered if you said -- and if
the judgment is reversed,in any event, the 50«50 rule should
not be applied.
Until that rule is changed by this Court, the
Court of Appeals would not have listened to that argument.
MR. ROBERTS:

No, they would not have listened to

the argument, in my opinion.

We feel that this 50*50 mutual

fault is an anachronism;under present authorities, we are
the only nation in the world, that I know of, that actually
adheres to it.
I feel that is a very, very unfair rule, as
demonstrated by the facts in this case.

Even Judge Wright,

in his opinion, finding mutual fault, said that the fault of
the tug and barge was flagrant and it was shocking to some
extent.
X would say that this case very aptly demonstrates
the inequities of the mutual fault doctrine.

There seems to

be no doubt that most of the shipping industry, the lawyers,
the maritime law association, Congress, to some extent, or
at least some of the Committees of Congress, feel that the
rule should be changed, and that the vessel should be charged
proportionately with its degree of fauLt.
Q

Where do we stand — or let me put the

question another .way»

Do we stand in the same posture here

19
as failure of Congress to alter legislation when they have
failed to adopt the Brussels Convention?
MR. ROBERTS:
fault

Mo, I don’t think so.

The mutual

doctrine» as I understand it, and read the cases,

came out of the Catherine Dickenson case.

It is a judge made

law and if it is a judge made law and the judges and members
of this Court can very easeily change it.
As very definitely demonstrated in the Hawn versus
?odq and Talbot where this Court said contributory negligence
was not a bar in a Maritime Court situation,where this Court
in.Moraine case said that there is a course of action in
England waters to wrongful death based on unseaworthiness,
there is no statutory prohibition in any way preventing this
Court from changing that archaic rule of mutual fault under
the circumstances or in the circumstances of any maritime
collision, as we have demonstrated by the terms of our brief.
Q

We had a case here last spring involving

an Erie Railroad Company where we were asked to overrule the
Halcyon Lines case, which, I think, was equally a judge made
law, and, as I recall, we declined to do it.

How do you feel

your basic proposal differs from that made by the petitioners
there?
MR. ROBERTS:
case.

2 am familiar with that particular

That was a maritime personal injury case, arising out

of the maritime personal injury case, and it was indemnity by

20
one side against the other after the original judgments had
been paid off.
In that particular case, it was the merits of the
case in chief that supported the action for indemnity
compared -- principles were applied.
The longshoremen or the railroad worker working on
the barge in that case, if he was contributoriaily negligent
or if he was negligent, his damages were reduced to the
degree of his negligence, comparative negligence.
And in this case, we have original parties.
is not a case for indemnity.

This

That is the only way I can

distinguish this particular case, Hr. Justice Rehnquist.
The Atlantic Railroad case certainly, and in all
maritime cases that I know of, the Jones Act, the Longshoremem and Harbor Workers Act cases, and so forth, comparative
negligence is being applied by this Court and by other
courts, States and Federal, in determining degree of fault in
the personal injury deal.
The only difference that we are asking you to do
at this time is to make it uniform and apply it In a property
damage case.
That's all we've got here.
Q

How does the share equally work now.

If the

barge suffers $10,000 worth of damage and the canker $30,000,
the barge pays $25,000 of your damage and you pay $5,000?

21
MR. ROBERTS:

That's exactly.

And I think that type of a situation leads to
litigation»because you get a situation and» I think» lawyers
when they get amongst themselves in litigation tend to be
fair with one another

and can be determined based upon the

facts the relative degrees of fault of their two vessels.
However» where you have a situation in which you
have one 90% at fault and another vessel maybe only 10%
at fault, and maybe it was a statutory fault and there is
nothing to do with contributory of proximate case, elements
in the case in any way.
Then the other lawyer is going to ask for
mutual fault all the time, whereas if we had a comparative
fault doctrine, and again, on that hypothetical, maybe
they would settle the case on the basis of 85% 15 of even
80-20.

No one is outraged by that type of negotiation

and settlement.
I think it is vary,
-

* v

very proper that that type

-

of settlement can go on, but I think it cannot go on in
this particular field where you have this

archaic,outmoded,

doctrine of mutual fault, and I don't see any reason at all
from the legislative, political or social purpose , why the
United States is the only maritime nation that adopts this
particular mutual fault.
Q

What were the relative damages, to the barge?

22
MR. ROBERTS:

They were fairly equal in this case.

Tine barge was the only one that sustained collision
damages because the tugboat had made the U-turn and the
tanker

sustained damage on its port bow,and the starboard

side .mid-ship the barge sustained damages.
There was a little more, I believe, damage on the
barge itself which would mean that the vessel might find
the SAM!A MARIA, under the mutual fault doc trine, to be more
than the other side, and that Is what is so, 1 think,
unfortunate about such a doctrine.
There is also some indication that it leads to
forum shopping.

That is where you get in inland waters a

vessel in collision with another, they will try and get it
in the State’s Court for the simple reason that the Court
would basically apply the law of the forum or the United
States which is the mutual fault doctrine and everything was
split down the middle, 50-50.
Also, from a human nature viewpoint,

I

thirk this

type of a doctrine tends to make the trial judge take the
easy way out, in all sincerety.

In stead of really Looki

at all the facts, as Judge Kilkenny did in this case, and i
made his own opinion and adopted it as his findings, there i.
some inclination to say, '’Well, under the mutual fault doc­
trine, all I had better do Is find a little,” and that is the
end of the case.

23
X believe that the doctrine is not useable any
more and that this Court should overrule it.
Thank you very much.
Q

Mr. Roberts, does the absence of any

briefs here by insurance companies indicate that they are
quite content with the existing rule?
•

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think that does.

It is not all insurance companies.

The —

Some of these vessels,

as the Court knows, have very large deductibles on collision
liabilities and things of this nature, and I don't think
the absence of anyone from industry or from the Maritime
Law Association, Congressional Records which we have cited
in our brief would certainly indicate that the great
majority of people concerned in this field would like the
proportionate

follow through.

Thank you.

rule that we call the halt distance rule or the .'Rule of

That rule was really first evolved by the decisions
of this Court in the Macooehee and The tlabria and the
Chattahoochee.
The rule laid down was that in a fog or restricted
visibility the ship should proceed at such a speed

as

would

enable her to stop in time to avoid collision with another
vessel which she sees emerge from the fog.
Q

Does that mean that it must come to a

complete stop as It approaches a fogbank?

Literally, it

HR. WOOD:

extent of visibility in the fog.

have got to go pretty slowly.

of the tug even unseen, would it not?
MR. WOOD:

If he could be certain that the tug

was going to stay where it was or maintain the same course
of speed and not make any turns, that’s the difficulty,.
Q

Why is that not a fair assumption on the

record of this case?
MR. WOOD:

Isn't that a reasonable assumption?
It might be,but you never can be sure

what's going to happen when you can't see the vessel.
That's why radar is such an imperfection and why we have so
many collisions despite radar that the courts have termed
the coin "radar assisted collisions" because they see only
the spot on the radar and can't tell the course and speed.
And it gives a misleading sense of security,

in the

ANDREA DORIA-STOCKHOLM case and many others ,the ships tend
to steer into each other when they think they are steering
away from each other.
Q

But in this particular case, even if there

were no fog, and this tug made that U-turn, what would have
happened?
MR. WOOD:

If there had been no fog and the SANTA

2b

MARIA could see that tug at all times with the visible eye»
and the tug made

a

U-turn in front of her in such close

distance that the SANTA MARIA could not avoid collision.,
I would think that it would be the tug's fault and not the
SANTA MARIA'S fault.
Q

Probably -- we are dealing in if's — the

tug would not have made the U-turn because I gather from the
record there was confusion as to where the SANTA MARIA was.
The tug thought the lights were on its starboard bow.

I say

they had to be on the port bow, didn’t they?
MR. WOOD:

Not necessarily.

There was a slight

bend in the channel which further confused -«
Q

It was the confusion caused by the fog —

MR. WOOD:
Q

Caused by the fog —

-- that caused the tug to make the turn,

MR. WOOD:

The tug in fact was taking in and through

this action because of fear of imminent collision.
Q

Does the capacity and experience of the tug

crew and the master enter into that somewhat?
MR. WOOD:
do with it.

I don’t think this really has anything to

We are not contesting fault of the tug.

We did

in the Trial Court level, but when we got to the Court of
Appeals we were only trying

for mutual fault, and the sole

issue before the Court of Appeals and the sole issue here on
this matter of navigation is: was the

SANTA MARIA

going an

27
excessive speed when she was going at a speed of 7 to 8 knots.
She knew that there was a vessel coming down meeting her
some place in that fog which 3he couldn’t see at that time
and she was going at such a speed that not only she couldn't
stop in half the distance, she couldn't stop in the full
distance.

Because when she first sighted that it was at

right angles to her course.
And, of course, with the tug at right angles to
her course, she occupied the whole distance to the point
where she first saw it, and she was still going from 4 to 7
knots at the point of collision.

She was going way over the

speed allowed by the Rule of Sight.
I want to point out the Rule of Sight is a rule of
safety.

It is a rule that was first announced by this

Court and fog, as Gilmore and Black says, fog is the ancient
terror of mariners.

Probably fog is one of the greatest

causes of ship collisions, and speed in fog is one of the
greatest causes of ship collisions.
My colleague here would argue that we «aoulift^t
have any standards, that we should leave everything to the
judgment of the master.
Q

Why should the SANTA MARIA be justified in

assuming on a clear day that the tug was going to stay on
its side of the river, and, hence, the $ANTA MARIA could
maintain its speed?

»•

And then not be entitled to assume that

2i>
if there is in a patch of fog?
MR, WOOD:
Q

What is the difference there?

Well, you wouldn’t say -~

Would the SANTA MARIA have been negligent

at all if on a clear day she maintained her full speed,
12 knots?
MR. WOOD:

I think the difference, as Mr. Justice

Stewart has pointed out, the very fog itself lends uncertainty
to the whole situation.

The very fact that there is fog

creates uncertainty in the whole situation*
If you have a bright, clear day, and you see the
tug coming down, why, of course, you realise that the tug
can see you and you are both going to stay on your own side.
But when you have fog, you don’t know what that tug is likely
to do when she suddenly sights you —
Q

But is more than likely to assume that

tugs don't make U-turn though, isn't it?
MR. WOOD:

I don't think you can be certain it

won * t.
Q

This case proves that.

MR. WOOD:

One thing has to be learned with a

tug different from other ships is that a tug just can't
handle the situation by going full astern, because it has
its barge coming down behind it and that produced a collision
with its own barge.
The tug reacted in extremes because of the confusion

29
of the fog*

I think that the fog creates much greater

danger than vessels meeting on a clear day and, therefore,
I don’t think anyone really has a right to assume anything
there are certain assumptions you can make, but above
all, you've got to keep your speed within what the law of
the statute it.
The statute, Article 16, says "moderate speed.”
Now, as (inaudible) says (Inaudible).
Now, the Courts for years have in applying that
statute, applied an interpretation that you must go at such
speed that you can stop within the Bale of Sight.
Q

But if he followed that sight rule to stop

the barge would it it, wouldn't it?
MR. WOOD:
Q

Yes,

If the tug followed the rule of sight?
And stopped — wouldn't the barge hit

it?
MR. WOOD:

The Buie of Sight does not require

coming to a complete stop.

The Rule of Sight would require

that you slow down enough so that you can stop.
Q

If you see something is about to bump into

you, you are supposed to stop.

That Is the purpose of the

rule.
MR. WOOD:

Well, then, the tug ought to be going

pretty slowly,
Q

The question is: how is it going to slow down

30
and keep from running up the rear-end of the tug?
Q

In practical fact, it — the Rule of Sight --

does sometimes, strictly applied, will sometimes require you
to stop, because the speed at which the Rule of Sight would
requirejou to go would be to slow to maintain steerage with.
HR. WOOD:
Q

That brings us into steerage way.

Before you get to steerage way, let me ask

you one more thing about the Rule of Sight.
Does the law of admiralty couple with this concept
of the Rule of Sight -- some concept of foreseeable risk
as you had in Cardoso's opinion in the Powers case of
proximate cause, so that you are only liable even you
breech into something that might reasonably have been foreseen
to result from your breech?
MR. WOOD:

Well, this touches on this.

I think,

as a matter of common sense, that radar — now we don't apply
the rule of sight in mid-ocean, where you have no radar
indication of another ship any other place.
I do not push this Rule of Sight to the extreme
that in the middle of the ocean, where you have an effective
radar and you are sure that there are no other vessels in
the area, in the vicinity at all, that you have to at all
times hold down to a rule of sight speed.
I am trying to answer Mr. Justice Rehnquist's
question.

When you are in harbor waters, inland waters, In a

31
channel, such as the Willamette River, there you are expected
to meet other vessels and your radar has already told you
that you are meeting other approaching vessels.
Therefore, you are required to go with the Rale
of Sight,and the very vessels that you are meeting are
within the protection of that duty to go that moderate
speed.
I think very much so, particularly because of the
fog which creates a cloud and uncertainty over the entire
navigation.

That's the very reason for the Rule of Sight.

Q

Would it be unreasonable to say here, from

the point of view of those experienced (inaudible) that
whereas a collision on a port-to-port passing might have
been anticipated in a fog, a collision of the type that
took place here couldn't have been anticipated at all?
MR. WOOD:

I think it would be a little unreasonable

to say it couldn't be anticipated at all.

Bear in mind the

ships are meeting at a bend in the channel so that with first
sighting — when the tug first sighted the lights of the ship
they were dead ahead, and you might have an election of which
way to go, I think it is going to be dangerous to try to
end this Ttule of sight to make it non-applicable in fog
situations where the other vessels hidden in the fog to say
well, we had a right to assume that she would stay on her
own side, or something.

I think you are leading to hazards.

32
Bear in mind that this is a rule of safety, and
we are talking about a rule that may affect life.

I mean

we are talking about a rule where ships may be carrying
passengers and we may not have just a little collision like
this.

You have life and death at stake in here, in these

cases.
I think that's the reason the Court has quite
uniformly been quite strict on :his leule of Bight.
Now, it just amazes me that counsel says the
Ninth Circuit is the only one to adhere to the Rule of Sight.
Gilmore and Black say a rule of thumb often
applied.

That is that the vessel could come to a dead stop

in half the distance.
Judge Leonard Hand calls it a rule that everybody
knows in the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company case.

The Second

Circuit has applied it over and over again.
Judge Leonard Hand says" 1though Article 16 only
requires a vessel in fog to go at moderate speed, as everybody
knows, the Courts have imposed a gloss upon this that the
'moderate speed

is that at which, If the other vessel also

does her duty, the vessel will be able to stop her way before
they collide.*"
Q

Have the other Courts — are there some

Courts that do not follow it?
MR, WOOD:

I would like to talk about that.

33

Q

I think we denied certiorari in that case

a couple years ago.
MR. WOOD:
(inaudible).

Hess Shipping allowed an exception of

That's all it did.

The Fifth Circuit recognizes the Rule of Sight.
There was a unanimous decision written by Judge John Brown,
an experienced admiralty practicioner, and that was the
Antinuous case, Finlayson-Forsaav, ,Pan-Atlantic» and I
cited these cases in the Brief.

There the Fifth Circuit

said: "...the Antinuous had to demonstrate that ... she
could stop before she traversed one-half the distance she
could see."
That was the rule in the Fifth Circuit.
Hess Shipping came along and you had a very large
tanker going at only 5 knots, not 7 or 8, and the testimony
was that she couldn't possibly have gone any slower without
being a hazard to navigation.
It ended up a 7 to 7 decision and you denied
certiorari and the exception allowed was steerageway, that
she couldn't have slowed down any more*
Q

But she could have dropped her anchor.

Mi. WOOD:
Q

She could have dropped her anchor.

Which the strict application of the Rule of

Sight would have required, wouldn't it?
MR. WOOD:

Under some decisions, yes.

34

I think the Pennsylvania, an early decision of this
Court so said.
In Hess Shipping, as I say, the -- I think it is
recognized as an allowance of an exception of bear steerage­
way»
The petitioner cannot escape under that umbrella
in this case»

They were going well in excess of bear

steerageway.
The SANTA MARIA had three basic speeds, full, half
and slow, and as the Court of Appeals opinion said,she
didn*t show that she couldn't have gone slower.
And my brief, on page 23, specifically covers this
and quotes the testimony that her helmsman, the very man
steering the ship,who had 22 years of experience, said it
steered good and steered just as well at slow speed as at
half and full.
"Q

Is it more difficult to hold an exact course

when you are going at slow speed?
"A

I don't find it so, no.

If you give it

enough wheel, she will hold her course real good."
And, later on, "Q

Does it make any difference

whether you are going full speed, half speed or slow speed
and fully loaded?
"A

Not if you give it enough wheel, it doesn't

make any difference ..."

35
Q

At 5 knots, would this collision have been

avoided?
MR. WOOD:
Q

I think so.

At 7, it ran the full distance between them?

Is there any evidence on that?
MR. WOOD:

Of course, the burden is on her under

the Pennsylvania Rule, but they pretty nearly missed, and
there is quite a difference in momentum between 5 and 7.
I am not an expert on ballistics or momentum, but
it seems to me there is something about rate-time“Speed,
and so forth, and I think it goes up pretty rapidly.

I

think at 5 knots, you can come to a slower speed or reduced
speed a lot quicker than you can at 7 or 8 knots.
And I think at 5 knots, if she had gone to full
astern immediately, she would have checked her headway enough
so that the barge would have swung clear.
In any event, the burden is on her to establish
that under the Pennsylvania Rule, because she has committed
a statutory violation.

It la her business to show not only

that her fault did not cause a collision, but could not have
caused the collision.
Q

Mr. Wood, do any of these cases treat the

Rule of Sight as a presumption, shifting the burden of
proof perhaps, and then leaving it to the Court to determine
from the evidence whether or not the presumption has been

36
overruled or outweighed by the evidence in a particular case?
MR» WOOD:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, I think that's

perhaps another way of stating the Pennsylvania Rule that
when she violates the Rule of Sight she is considered to
have committed a statutory violation.
It puts on her the burden of proving not only that
this violation didn't cause the accident but couldn't have
caused it, and, therefore, if she fails to prove that, she
is held condemned on that ground.
I think it is just another way of stating the
Pennsylvania Rule; in other words, its a presumption that
she has contributed to the collision, and in this case she
didn't put on any evidence that the collision still would
have occurred, and really couldn't.
I think this — I just merely want to say that
we have no conflict here with the fact that you consider the
circumstances, because, of course, when you are determining
whether your speed is such that you can stop in half the
distance, all the circumstances come into play, whether you
are fully loaded and have more momentum because of your
weight or because you are light, whether you have a head
wind,

whether you have quick reversing engines or slow

reversing engines, whether you've got a head wind or a tail
wind.

All those circumstances come into play, and it doesn't

take any sliderule calculation, as my brother would say, any

37
more than when you are driving a car down a highway in a
thick fog.

It is probably

a

pretty prudent thing to do to

not go at such speed9 but you can't stop within a Rule of
Sight because there might be a broken down automobile in
the middle of the road ahead of you.
And when you are driving down the highway in a
dense fog, why it is probably a pretty prudent thing to not
exceed the speed that you can see ahead in the fog.

At

least I normally try not to go more than that, at least
at which I can see lights.
So, I think it is a rule of common sense.

I

think the Court of Appeals decision on this point, when read
carefully, is probably the best brief one could write for
upholding the Rule of Sight.
This brings me to the point of damages, and
division of damages.
I would just like to very briefly sketch the
history of this.
Some 120 years ago, of course, this Court
announced that in mutual fault cases damages are divided
equally, and that has continued to be the rule.
The same rule is applied in England for years and
years and years, and then it was actually made statutory.
I did not have all this and didn't put it in the brief»but
by the English Judicit Act of 1873, the 50-50 rule was made

statutory.
Then in 1910, we had the Brussels Convention which
adopted proportional fault, but also did a lot of other
things in governing relations with cargo, and the obligations
toward cargo.
Now, we come to the legislative history in the
United States,and Brussels Convention was submitted to the
Senate in 1937 and it sat here for 10 years.

There wasn't

much action during the war but it remained here a: ter the
war, and after a 10-year period no action was taken on it
and it was withdrawn.

Then in 1962, In the 87th Congress,

they put in Senate Bill 2313 and H.R., in the House, 7911,
and those finally died on the floor.

They were reported out

of committee but died on the floor.
Then, the next year, in 1963

— X do not include

this in my brief, unfortunately. I didn't have all the
legislative history research facilities in Portland and I
checked this out with the Congressional Library here —
in the 88th Congress, again two bills were introduced,
S. 555 and H.R. 1070, but those bills again which provide
for proportional fault and to really enact the substance of
Brussels, and they never got out of committee9 never got out
of subcommittee.
How, so much for past history.

This Court,

although it was a personal injury case, it reiterated in

39
Halcyon the rule that in collision cases it is 50-50.
And as recently as 1963, in Weyerhaeuser v. United
States, the unanimous decision opinion written by Mr. Justice
Potter again refers to the rule, and so we have here a rule
which is worked

(inaudible)

Now, briefly on the merits of this rule versus
proportional fault, contrary to what my colleague says, I
am sure that it promotes silence.

1 think, from my

experience —
Q

Well, it eliminate one issue from the

case, doesn’t it?
MR. WOOD:

It certainly elminates one issue.

I think experienced lawyers sitting across the table will
recognize that there is some fault here and some fault there
and we settle 50-50.
In my own experience of 30 years I have never tried
a major, you know, a big half million, two million dollar
collision case.
I have settled many of them.

And I don't know one

in which I didn't say, "Your ship was a lot more at fault
than ours and the other fellow was saying, "Your ship was
a lot more at fault."
But when you get all through arguing you have to
admit there was some fault on both sides and you settle it
50-50.

40
Now, the Al'JDKIA-DORIA-STOCKHOLM} which was one of
the major collisions with most money involved, I don't believe
it was ever tried in the District Court,
settlement.

It was an ultimate

These cases have uniformly been settled and it

is a pretty practical rule because, as my colleague's brief
points out, you’ve got mostly hull insurance companies on
both sides of these things and maybe they lose a little here
but it evens up in the next case,

tiaybe in one case they

felt they should have come two-thirds, one-third, but in
the next case it is the other way, and they all settle 50-50.
Stow, for just a moment on the burden that this
might place on the Court, not only do I think that if you
have a proportional fault rule each side is going to say your
ship is going to say, "Your ship is more at fault."
yours is more at fault."

"No,

Or you are going to litigate, but

you are going to make the trials much longer because it is
going to get to be a game of points.
-tow, if I can just prove that you violated the
Rule of Sight, you were going too fast in fog, that’s all
X have to prove, but if we get to proportional fault, I
want to prove that he was not keeping a proper lookout on
the bow, that he wasn’t blowing his danger signals, he
wasn't blowing fog signals» they turned port when he should
have gone starboard, his radar watch was inadequate, and I
am going to try to build up about ten points.

And if he

41
proves a couple of good points against me, I've still got
an SO-»20.
I think you are going to have your trials get to
be a sort of game of points and the trials are going to be
a lot longer.
Now, Brussels Convention, very frankly, I favor
Brussels Convention in to to.

But I don't think --*1 think

it would be a great mistake to try to adopt one rule of
proportional fault, which is kind of a piecemeal adoption
of Brussels Convention.
Remember the Brussels Convention also regulates
the obligations toward cargo, and this is very important to
this case to understand the ship owner's obligation toward
cargo, because every major collision case, or almost
every one, you have inextricably involved with the cross»
liabilities between two ship owners, you have obligations
to their cargo.
Q

I suppose the Brussels Convention could be

recommitted to the Senate, could it not?
HR. WOOD:
Q

Can do it tomorrow?

MR. WOOD:
Q

Could do it tomorrow.

Of course.

Any suggestion it may be done?

MR. WOOD:

There is talk of it from time to time.

There is nothing to prevent It.

1 am sure that if there was

42
enough interest and enough push in this thing, that if
people really wanted the 50-50 rule —
Q

People9 you mean insurance companies?

5®. WOOD:

Insurance companies, steamship owners,

cargo people, if they wanted to get a law passed, there
would not be any great problem about it.
Q

Lawyers would love it, wouldn't they?

MR. WOOD:
Q
hasn't it.

Sure, I'd love it.

This has been more than a half century, now,
That's slower than usual on these things.

MR. WOOD:
Q

Before Congress, yes, 1937.

But 1910 was when the convention toolc place.

Wasn't it first presented right after it was — agreement
was reached?

MR. WOOD:

I believe not, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first that I have found that it was presented was 1937,

which — although, it was originally adopted in 1910, but
I think you have to allow 25 years for it to be adopted by

a lot o£ the other maritime nations and then when it got to
be pretty uniformly adopted by the other maritime nations
they made the push to have it done here.

It never took hold.

I want to explain this matter of cargo.

You see,

the cargo on the — it is important to distinguish between
the carrying vessel, which carries the cargo,and the non­
carrying vessel.

43

For many years, under Acts of Congress, the
Harter Act, and carriage of goods by fiat -- we call it
COSSA -- cargo has no right to recover against its own
ship, the carrying ship, for negligent navigation, which
is involved in collisions.
But cargo has always had the right to recover
100% against the non-carrying vessel.
happens.

So that’s what

Cargo gets its 100% of its recovery against the

non-carrying vessel and under the 50-50 rule the non-carrying
vessel then includes its payment to cargo in its damages
and gets 50% back from the carrying vessel.
So, indirectly, the carrying vessel ends up paying
50% of the damage to its own cargo, but no more.

They used

to try to devise bill of lading clauses to get around that.
» i

Back in United States v. Atlantic Mutual, this Court held
those bill of lading clauses void as against public policy.
So the law is well settled that

the innocent

cargo recovers 100% against the non-carrying vessel which,
in turn, gets 50% back.
But now, if you were to adopt piecemeal extract
out of Brussels Convention a rule of proportional fault,
look at the result you would create.

Innocent cargo on the

carrying vessel -- and let’s assume the carrying vessel
is 90% to blame and non-carrying vessel 10% — innocent
cargo gets 100% of its damages against that 10% to blame

44
non-carrying ship.

That ship, in turn, under proportional

law would get 90% of the damages back from the carrying
vessel.
So you have the carrying vessel which Congress,
under Harter Act and CGGSA, says is not responsible for
damage to the cargo due to negligent navigation is being
indirectly held for 90% of the damage.
How this does two things.

Number one, it pushes

us a lot further than in the laws of other nations.

If we

are trying to achieve uniformity, let’s try to get some
uniformity in our maritime law, with England and Japan and
Italy and Germany. But here we’d be pushing the thing further
from uniformity because here you create situations where
cargo would end up as a 90% recovery from its own vessel.
And under the law of other maritime nations, cargo
cannot recover from its own vessel.

And as for recovery

against the non-carrying ship it is not 100% but it is such
percentage as that non-carrying vessel is at fault.
Not only do you create havoc with uniformity,but
you open the door,at least you create an atmosphere where
there i3 an invitation to collusion.
A ship carrying a valuable; cargo, has, say, $lmillic
in cargo damage, and say maybe there is only $100,000
scattered damage to the hulls of the two ships, why lie —
if he is - pretty much in the blame — is going to come in and

45

try to admit sole blame, say, ”1 am 100% at fault, and that
other ship is free and clear," and shape the witnesses*
testimony that way.

Because if she’s 100% to blame she

doesn't have to pay any cargo damage.

The cargo can't

recover against the other ship.
Excuse me.

Yes, if the carrying vessel is 100%

to blame, that presupposes that a non-carrying vessel has
no fault.

So cargo gets nothing.

And so with $1 million

cargo damage and ship maybe $100,000 hull damage, why, the
ship is going to throw the case, if it can do so gracefully,
and escape that $1 million liability even though it might
take $100,000 tab.
I think it opens the door to collusion and leads
to ridiculous results.

As far as the forum shopping, I've

never seen any great amount of forum shopping on this.

I

don't think it exists, and when collusions are on inland
waters, of course, they are controlled by the law of the
place and forum shopping doesn't do you any good.
I submit that — in conclusion, I am saying that
the rule is a workable rule.
years.

We've had it for a number of

We don't have the reason for change here that you

have in frforaane»

In Moragne, involving a deck on inland

waters, we had utter chaos in the maritime field of sub­
stantive right of recovery for death because you relegated
the suitor to the State death statute which varies from State

46
to State and which some places — you had all kinds of nonuniform results.
We don’t have the reason for trying to make new
law or change law that you had in Sforagne, and in view of
the legislative history I think this thing should be
straightened out by Congress, and I agree with, I believe
it was Hr. Justice Rehnouist here, that absence of briefs
amicus here, and the absence of any recent efforts in
Congress, shows that everybody is pretty well satisfied with
this 50-50 rule.

It is a good workable rule.

MR. CHIEF, JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wood.

Mr» Roberts, we allow you take the floor for a
few minutes.

If you have anything by way of rebuttal, we

will give you three minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH E. ROBERTS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just have a couple of remarks.
Under the comparative fault doctrine, Mr. Wood has
already said that under the mutual fault doctrine the non­
carrying vessel puts — if it is 10% at fault now, it still
gets 50% back from the carrying vessel.

It seems to me that

if it gets 90% back from the carrying vessel based on
comparative fault, that is more equitable and just
all of the circumstances.

under

And X can't see any difference or

47
validity to his argument between the 50% he gets back and
fete 90% which he would get back if this Court decided to
adopt the comparative fault rule.
That’s all I have.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:53 o’clock, p.ra., the case was
submitted.)
