MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 71-1553, Gilligan against Morgan.
Mr. Martin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS V. MARTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
.MR. MART0N:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented by this case is whether
the propriety of the training, weapons, and orders should
be determined by the federal court or by the other branches
of the Federal Government.
Another question presented by this is whether
injunctive relief against the use of the National Guard or
against the use of certain training weapons or equipment
of the Guard would constitute an unwarranted interference
with the legitimate activity of the state.
This case arose out of the use of the National
t

Guard to control syllabus orders which occurred at Kent
State University in May of 1970.

Respondents filed suit

the following fall, claiming that the Governor had
prematurely called the Guard to duty, that the conduct of
the Guard while on duty at Kent State violated the students8
constitutional rights and that Section 2923.55, which
provides under limited circumstances immunity for members
»

4
of the National Guard, was unconstitutional»
Respondents also claimed

that the confciauan

of the same operating methods and procedures of the Natiomtl
Guard, under the continued direction of defendants,
constituted a threat of repetition of injury in the future»
The district court dismissed the complaint on the
ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted.

The court of appeals unanimously affirmed

the district court in its dismissal of two causes of action»
However, it found that the complaint did state a claim with
respect to the following questions

Whether there was and is

a pattern of training, weaponry# and orders of the National
Guard which requires or makes inevitable the use of a
lethal force in controlling civil disorders where such force
is not reasonably necessary.
Petitioners, who are the successors in office
to defendants below, filed a petition for writ of
certiorari to this Court to review the portion of the
judgment which reversed the district court.
The issue, as framed by.the court of appeals,
will require the Court to determine the propriety of the
training,weapons,and. orders of -the National Guard.

The

resolution of this issue has been committed to the other
branches of the Federal Government.

Petitioners therefore

contend that this issue, presents a non-justiciable political

5

question.

All of the factors or formulations which this

Court has said may describe a political question are
involved herein.

There is a demonstrable constitutional

commitment of the issue to Congress.
Article If Section 8 of the Constitution gives
Congress the power to provide for the training and
equipment of the National Guard.

The Congress, pursuant to

this power, has enacted legislation which prescribes the
proper training, weapons, and orders for the National
Guard.
Congress has also enacted legislation which
delegates to the President the authority to prescribe
regulations and issue orders concerning these matters.

The

President has also acted pursuant to his authority and has
prescribed mandatory riot control training requirements for
the National Guard.

Any relief which a federal court could

give would express a lack of respect for the coordinate
branches of the Government.

Both Congress and the

President have the authority and the responsibility to
determine the proper methods of training and equipping the
National Guard.
Any judicial relief which would control these
matters would therefore indicate lack of respect by the
Court for -these coordinate branches to carry out their
responsibilities.

6

Any judicial relief which controlled the trainin'?,weapons# or orders of the National Guard would also run the
risk# create the risk# of conflicting pronouncements by the
various departments on the same subject.

Both Congress and

the President have acted pursuant to their authority in the
past.

Thera is no reason to assume that they will not

again so act in the future.
Any judicial relief as to these matters might
create varying or even conflicting directives with future
directives from either Congress or the President.

These

conflicting directives could cause confusion and delay
responding to the syllabus orders.

This delay could impede

the ability of the state to control the disorders.
The proper method of training and equipping the
National Guard and preparing them to carry out their
responsibilities should be made by Congress or the
President and not by the Court.

The relief requested by

respondents herein shows the need for expertise and
specialized knowledge.

The respondents have requested that

the use of the National Guard to control disorders be
enjoined until it is determined that the training of the
members of the National Guard is competent and that they
have been provided with the best available non-lethal
equipment.
There is no ready criteria or standard for a court

»

7
to determine whether

ng is competent and

whether or not the equipment is the beat available.

The

Department of the Army, because of its experience in the
area, is better able to determine the amount of training chat
such troops need and the type of training.
The Department of the Army is also more likely
to have knowledge of new developments in theories, in
methods, on controlling syllabus orders and to have
knowledge of new developments in new equipment.

It is also

better able to evaluate the effectivenss of such techniques
and equipment not only because of its experience but
because it has facilities whereby the techniques and
equipment may be tested under simulated riot conditions.
In addition, a court cannot provide a continuing
supervision and revision of the training and weapons of the
National Guard, which is necessary to properly prepare
them to perform their function.

The court is limited.

It

must wait for litigants to bring a case or controversy in
order for it to make its determination.
Petitioners also contend that the relief
requested herein would be an unwarranted interference with
a vital activity

of the state, preparation for and control

of civil disorders.
Q

The relief requested is injunctive and
t

declaratory relief only, is it not?

8

MR. MARTIN:

Yes, Your Honor»

I believe the main

relief is to enjoin the use of the National Guard until it
is determined that the trainingweapons, and orders

are

proper.
Q

That is, propax* in the view of the court?

MR. MARTIN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And was there ever here an action for

damages as a result of what happened at Kent State in May
of 1970?
MR. MARTIN:
believe there

Not in this suit, Your Honor.

1

are various suits pending for actions which

involve what occurred at Kent State.
Q

But this lawsuit does not involve anything.,

any damages, for what happened there; it is directed to the
future entirely?
MR, MARTIN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Martin, ray understanding of the general

rule is that the prayer for relief is not a part of the
complaint.

And, therefore, if the district court is going

to dismiss the complaint, it would have to conclude not
only that the particular relief sought is not warranted but
that no conceivable type of equitable relief would be
warranted =
MR. MARTIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

type of relief is warranted.

We contend that no

Petitioners are particularly
i

9
concerned with the release rrraasted, which weald enjoin
the use of the National Guard until a court' had
determined the propriety of their training, weapons, and
orders„
Q

Would you say not even a declaratory

judgment is warranted?

That is a form of equitable relief,

is it not?
MR. MARTIN:

Your Honor, petitioners’ interest

in a declaratory judgment would be limited to whether the
declaratory judgment would have the same disruptive effect
upon the use of the National Guard as an injunction.
Q

But your position is the political question

would eliminate—
MR. MARTIN:

Would eliminate all.

That is right,

Your Honor; that is our position.
Our position is, if it is not a political
question, even if it is not a political question, we do not
believe that injunctive relief against either the use of the
National Guard or which would specify certain training,
weapons, and orders is warranted.
Q

Did you challenge standing below?

MR. MARTIN:
Q

Do you here?

MR. MARTIN:
Q

No, Your Honor, we did not.

We do not.

Is it open?

10
•:vrl. MARTIN:

The court : ■ ' cer erpre-^sly reserved

that question for the district court.
Q

May X ask why you do not challenge standing?

MR. MARTIN:

Part of it, Your Honor, is since we

failed to do it below, we may not have realised that we
could have and we believed that even if plaintiffs or
respondents did have standing, there was still no relief
which could be granted.
Q

On the other hand, if there was no standing,

you would, not have to reach all those questions, would you?
MR. MARTIN:
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

And that would avoid these important

constitutional questions.
MR. MARTIN:
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

Is not standing a constitutional question

itself, but is it not a threshold one in the sense that it
is jurisdictional?

This is case or controversy type

standing that you are talking about.
MR. MARTIN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that not sort of a threshold question

before you get to a lot of- other things?
MR. MARTIN?

It is a threshold question, and it

may be we should have raised that issue, but we did not.
Q

You did not, but is not that always open?

MR. MARTIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

il
Q

What about it right now?

MR. MARTIN:

All right, Your Honor, 2 believe

that there is no allegation in the complaint that the
respondents were even students at the time the disorders
occurred.

The complaint was filed the following fall.

Plaintiffs at that time contended they were students and
sought injunctive relief.
We also believe that any- question as to the
propriety of injunctive relief is now moot.

Plaintiffs"

respondents base their claim for injunctive relief and a
continuing threat of injury on the continuance of the same
rules and operating procedures of the National Guasrd under
the continued supervision and direction of the defendants.
Neither condition now obtains.

The rules of conflict or

rules of engagement of the Ohio National Guard have been
changed, and Ohio has now adopted the federal rules of
engagement.
None of the defendants who were in control of the
National Guard at the time of the Kent State disorders now
have any responsibility with respect to the National Guard.
Q

How is that change evidenced by a directive

or by a statute or by a regulation or what?
MR. MARTIN:

It was changed by—I am not sure of

the proper term—a directive or order of the adjutant general
Q

1' take it the record does not show that, the

12
record before this Court, but is it subject to judicial
notice?

Is it in a form that—
MR. MARTIN:

The only way it may show up is we

filed a memorandum suggesting mootness which contained these
rules.

The title is Op Plan Two for Control of Civil

Disorders.

We filed a copy of that with our memorandum

suggesting—
Q
take it.

That is another issue besides standing, I

That is mootness in the sense that there has been

some nev? law that has intervened, is it not?

Rut are these

plaintiffs in any different position to make the challenge
than any other citizen?

Would any other citizen in the

community have the same right, if any, to maintain this
complaint, to file and maintain this complaint?
A

As I construe their complaint, Your Honor,

they claim a different interest in that they are students,
and the National Guard could again be called to the
university, to Kent State University, to control disorders.
Q

What about a student in another state, in

another university, where the regulations governing the
National Guard were the same as existed at the time of the
Kent State episode?

Would they have standing on the theory

of respondents?
MR. MARTIN:

[No response]

Perhaps I will ask*your friend to address

13
himself to that later on.
MR. MARTIN:

I am sure he could better address

himself to that, Your Honor.
Petitioners contend that the same consideration
which required denial of injunctive relief against the
Governor from prematurely calling the Guard to duty should
also require denial of injunctive relief against the use of
the National Guard until there is a judicial determination
as to the propriety of the training, weapons, and orders,
In order to control civil disorders, the state must be able
to act immediately.

If it is required to await a judicial

determination before it can act, the harm to be prevented
could occur without any opposition.
Petitioners also contend that any relief which
would require or prohibit the use of certain training
weapons or orders of the National Guard would also unduly
impair the ability of the state to prepare for and control
disorder.
No one can predict the time, place, size, or type
of disorders, and no one can predict what measures will be
necessary to control them.
The state officials must, therefore, be given
broad discretion to prepare for any eventuality, and the
state officials must also be given discretion to determine
under emergency conditions just what methods or techniques
!

14
should be used to control the disorder,

Any relief by a

court which would control the training or weapons or orders
of the court would ©strict this discretion and thereby
xmpair their ability to prepare for and control disorders,
We believe the instant case is readily distinguishable
from the cases relied upon by respondents and cited by the
court below, which granted injunctive relief against
illegal police activity.
None of those cases required the court to review
the training, weapons, or orders of the police department.
None of those cases enjoined or required the use of certain
training, weapons, or orders.
The injunctive relief in those cases was very
narrow.

It was limited to conduct which could not be

constitutional or could not be valid under any circumstances.
There was, therefore, little risk that injunctive relief
would inhibit beneficial and lawful police conduct as well
as unconstitutional police conduct.
Q

What line of cases are you talking about?

MR, MARTIN:

Hague v. C.I.O., Your Honor, and the

cases where a federal court has granted injunctive relief
against certain conduct of a police department.
In the instant case., on the other hand, the
training, weapons, and orders of the National Guard are not
illegal in themselves and not illegal under any circumstances.

15

The basis for the claim that they may be illegal or may be
unconstitutional is that alleged unconstitutional conduct
by the Guard resulted therefrom.

Injunctive relief against

the training,, weapons, or orders of the National Guard
could therefore also inhibit lawful conduct by the state and
beneficial conduct in controlling disorders.
Petitioners contend that the issue of the
training, weapons, and orders of the National Guard has
been committed to the other* branches of the Federal
Government and that these branches of the Federal Government
are better able to deal with the problem.
Petitioners, therefore, respectfully submit that
this case presents a non-justiciable political question.
Petitioners also contend that any injunctive relief which
could be granted against the use of the National Guard or
against its training, weapons, and orders would constitute
an unwarranted interference with the ability of the state to
protect itself against disorders.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. MARTIN:

Thank you, Mr. Martin.

Thank you, Your Honors.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

The United States is not a party to this case

IS
and had no direct role in the events which occurred at
Kent in. May, 1970.

The actors there were officers and

members of the Ohio National Guard, a

state organization,

acting at that time under state authority.
However, the United States Army is responsible for
the training of the National Guard.

Consequently, the

United States is mutch concerned about this case and the
possible impact of the decision below and the complications
which 'would inevitably ensue if the federal court should
undertake to exercise oversight of the training of the
National Guard.
Under the system established by Congress, National
Guard units are ordinarily under state command and
operational control.

They receive federal financial support

though only if they maintain "federal recognition" by
meeting prescribed federal standards.

The state is free

to Support its own National Guard any way it wants to.

But

to obtain federal support, they must meet federal standards.
Q

There is no state that does not.

MS. GRISWOLD;

There is no state that does not now

meet federal standards.

There have been in the past, in the

distant past.

And, indeed, the present National Guard

organization only dates from the early part of this cen­
tury.

The whole business of trying to handle the Civil

War- was largely done through state-raised troops.

*

17
The statute passed by Congress authorises the
t

President to-—again | I quote—"prescribe regulations and
.issue orders necessary to organize, discipline, and govern
the National Guard„1

And this is pursuant to the provision

of the Constitution which gives to Congress the power to
provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the
militia and reserves to the states the authority of training
the militia according to the discipline prescribed by
Congress.
The provision for uniform training or discipline
insures that the militia can be effectively integrated
into the regular army if the need arises.

The Constitution

contemplates that the Federal Government will prescribe the
training program, but the state actually administers the
training as long as the Guard has not been federalized.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, did I understand

Mr. Martin correctly that they just adopted these federal
standards while this case was pending?
MR. GRISWOLD;

They have adopted the federal

standards since this case was begun, and I will come to the
details in just a moment.
The Army is naturally primarily concerned with
insuring that, the Guard is qualified to serve as a part of
the Army if called into active federal duty.

But the Army

has also promulgated detailed instructions for civil defense

18
control training, and this training program is for National
Guardsman as well as for members of the regular army.
Beginning in 1971, the army beg ah. to give National
Guard recruits 15 hours of additional special civil
disturbance control training.

This special training was

initiated in recognition of the fact that Guard units are
more likely to toe called to suppress civil disturbance than
are regular army units.
An important aspect of civil disturbance control
training is the rules governing the use of force.

When the

Guard is in state status, it is subject to the state's use
of force regulations.

The National Guards of all states,

including Ohio, have now voluntarily adopted the federal
standards on use of force as their own.

At the time of the

Kent State incident, however, in May, 1970, the Ohio rules
were substantially different from the federal rules and
different from what they are today.
The army rules, which have been in effect since
«

March, 1968, axe set forth in the appendix of the Government’s
torief, beginning on page 29.

And the relevant portions are

stated on pages 33 and 34 of the Government's brief.
from the top of page 33.

These are the federal regulations

now adopted by the Ohio National Guard and all other
national guards.
Q

I read

Arid adopted sine© May of 1970.
i

19
MR. GRISWOLD:

By Ohio late in 1970.

Since the

events and since this mit was brought.

I read from the top of page 33:
"The presence of loaded weapons"—well, let me
change to pages 13 and 14 of our brief where they are
summarised, rather than the full text.
The rules provide detailed regulations for the
use of deadly force, and it is authorised only where—just
above the middle of page 13—"lesser means hcwe been
exhausted or are unavailable, the risk of death or serious
bodily harm to innocent persons is not significantly
increased by its use, and the purpose of its use is one or
more of the following:

Self-defense to avoid death or

serious bodily harm; prevention of a crime which involves
a substantial risk of

death or serious bodily harm (for

example, setting fire to an inhabited dwelling or sniping),
including the defense of other persons? prevention of the
destruction of public utilities or similar property vital
to public health or safety? or Cd) detention or prevention
of the escape of persons who have committed or attempted to
commit one of the serious offenses referred to in (a),
and (c)

above."
And then with respect to live ammunition, the

present rules of force provide, as quoted at the top of
page 14.

(b),

20

"Task force commanders are authorised to have live
ammunition issued to personnel under their command.
Individual soldiers will be instructed, however, that they
may not load their weapons except when authorised by an
officer or, provided they are not under the direct control
and supervision of an officer, when the circumstances would
justify their use of deadly force.

Retention of control by

an officer over the loading of weapons until such time as
the need for such action ie clearly established is of
critical importance in preventing the unjustified use of
deadly force.

Whenever possible, command and control

arrangements should be specifically designed to facilitate
such careful control of deadly weapons."
It is obviously a difficult and delicate situation.
You might have an individual soldier out alone where he
might have to use his judgment, but it is placed under the
control of an officer.
Q

At the time that this suit was filed, the

complaint was, as I understand it, that the Ohio rules
allowed them to carry loaded weapons.
MR. GRISWOLD;
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

That is what the suit was about.

MR. GRISWOLD:

The Ohio rules, which were then in

force are set out on pages 41 to 45 of the Government's
brief.

And I would call attention to what they were and the

21

complete change between that and the present rules.

This

appears on page 43 in the Appendix B to the Government's
brief under the heading "f. Weapons.”
"When all other means have failed or chemicals are
not readily available, you are armed with a rifle and have
been issued live ammunition.”
That is pretty much encouragement, I should think.
"The following rules apply in the use of firearms;
(1) Rifles will be carried with a round in the chamber in
the safe position."

They are to carry loaded weapons.

"Exercise care and be safety minded at all times."
That is not much suggestion about safety as to the other
people.
And then "(2) Indiscriminate firing of weapons is
forbidden.

Only single-aimed shot at confirmed targets

will be employed.

Potential targets are:"—-and then I will

turn to "(c)" at the top of page 44.
"In any instance where human life is endangered
»

by the forcible, violent action of a rioter, or"—and it is
or—"when rioters to whom the Riot Act has been read cannot
be dispersed by any other reasonable means, then shooting is
justified."
Mr. Chief Justice, I understand I am to have some
of Mr. Martin’s time of which he some left.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue.

MR. GRISWOLD:

In December, 1970, seme seven

months following the shooting at Kent State, the Ohio
National Guard issued a new operational plan which adopted
the army use of force rules verbatim.

This appears on orders

of the Adjutant General of Ohio, which have been filed with
the Clerk of this Court.

I think that such orders ought to

have the status of regulations and ought to be capable of
being taken judicial notice of by the Court.
Nov? I would like to turn to the legal position
where, it seems to me, that first we have a good old question
quite apart from political question, quite apart from
standing, simply of equitable jurisdiction.

The only prayer

in this complaint is for equitable jurisdiction.

This

appears on page 10.
“Wherefore, plaintiffs request that this Court
enter

judgment as follows;

(a) Enjoining Defendant Rhodes,,

(b) Enjoining Defendant Rhodes...
Rhodes...

(c) Enjoining Defendant

(d) Enjoining Defendants, and their successors'!—

and finally

(e) declaring a section of the Ohio Revised

Code to be unconstitutional and void.

That is a declaratory

judgment, but the court below decided that against the
respondents here, and they did not file any petition and it
is not before the Court.
I recognize that one is not completely bound by
the prayer, but there is not the slightest doubt that this

23

suit was not brought and cannot be brought because of the
wrong that was done to anyone at Kent State in 1970.

This

is not a tort suit and there will not be federal jurisdiction
of this case as a tort suit.
There is no basis for this suit except as a suit
to enjoin a violation, a threatened violation, under the
Civil Rights Act, and I would suggest that the mere showing
that there was an event once in the past does not provide a
basis for equitable jurisdiction.
A recent case which is fairly close to that is
Laird v. Tatum.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, you say only

equitable relief was sought.

Are you including within,

equitable relief a possibility of a declaratory judgment?
MR. GRISWOLD:

There is no prayer for a

declaratory judgment except with respect to this one
section of the Ohio statute which they lost below and did
not seek to bring here.
Q

How about subparagraph (f)?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Subparagraph {£), granting such

other and furthur relief as this court deems just and
proper, and I assume that this Court will grant such further
relief as it deems just and proper? I do not think thafc
really adds to the scope of the claim, which is solely for
an injunction, and I also have considerable feeling that the

24
same rules as to equitable jurisdiction are applicable to
a declaratory judgment which is really a kind of injunction
which does not have quite the immediate teeth that an
injunction has, but it is res judicata? and you can then
coma in and apply to the Court for an order to comply with
it.
Something was done at Kent State which was
unfortunate.

Firm action was taken to correct the

regulations and instructions and training of the Ohio
National Guard.

This may well have beers due to federal

influence? though that does not appear affirmatively in
the record.
In this situation? it is my contention that it
is not appropriate for the courts to intervene and to
undertake to prescribe or supervise the training of the
National Guard.
Q

Should we limit it to the new regulation?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Is the Court limited to the new

regulation?
Q

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

X would think with respect to the

determination of the propriety of equitable relief? it was.
Q

And we would not have to approve of those old

ones ? would we?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No? certainly not.

*

I do not approve

25
of the old ones—
Q

Well, I hope so.

There is a new

governor, a new adjutant general, both of whom have made it
plain that they do not support the rules upon which action
was taken before.

I well remember when in filing a motion

to substitute new government officers, you had to get a
declaration from them as to whether they proposed to continue
to follow the same policy.
Now we do it automatically as a matter of course,
which is probably an improvement? but it is perfectly plain
that the present officers, against whom the injunction is
sought, do not propose to follow the same policy.

The

training regulations have been changed and the statute as to
I

which a declaratory judgment was sought has been repealed.
Much of the talk in the respondents5 brief is
about the wrongs that the governor and the adjutant general
did.

But this is not a tort suit,

It is, as I have said,

solely a suit for an injuntion.
To proceed with this case, it seems to me, is to
make it a sort of phantom case, and I have sometimes thought

27
that when I have more time available, I may try to write
an article about phantom cases in the Supreme Court»

For

example, Biwens, decided two years ago, is a phantom case»
The actual facts there bear no relation to the issue which
was decided by the Court,

And similarly last term,

Mande1 was a phantom case; for we knew facts which were not
in the record, which made it a very differant case than it
was»

These arise because people file motions to dismiss in

the lower courts as the quickest way to get rid of a case,
and it seems to me perhaps doubtful and perhaps questionable
under the case in controversy standard of the Constitution
whether the Court should undertake to decide issues in
cases which have become so removed from reality as this one
has Q

When you write that article, have in mind

Accordingly, we submit that the judgment below
should be reversed, with directions that the complaint
should be dismissed»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Geltmer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. GELTNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GELTNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Members of the Court;
Before I go into my argument, I would just like to
clarify two points which came up in the preceding arguments
and about which I might be able to clear the record.
The first is the claim for declaratory relief.
Since I am the draftsman of the complaint, I guess I have
got to stand by it.

In sub-parts—I am reading from page II

of the appendix—in sup-parts (b), (c), and £d) on page
i

11 of the prayer for relief, after requesting injunctive
relief, the paragraph then proceeds to recite the words
"and declaring the use of the Ohio National Guard troops
contrary to those requirements to be unlawful."

It is that

portion which is intended to be the request for declaratory
as well as injunctive relief.
Q
this out of?

Can you give me any form book that you got
Every one I have evdr seen said you ask for

23

a declaratory injunction and then you a3k for the injunction;
right?
MR. GELTNER:

I have not learned it that way,

Your Honor.
Q

1.f you get an injunction, do you need a

declaratory judgment?
MR. GELTNER:

You might, yes, Your Honor.

You

might as to some aspects.
Q

If you properly drew your injunction, would

you need a declaratory judgment?
MR. GELTNER;
Q

No, you would not.

Why do you ask for an injunction and you claim

this last thing, you also want a declaratory judgment after
that?
MR. GELTNER;

That is right, Your Honor.

It was

anticipated that the injunctive aspect of the relief, if
gotten, need not simply be a recital of past events being
wrong and enjoining future events.

Rather, it might be

I

directed at specific items.

For example, specifically

ordering the Guard ho longer to carry loaded weapons into
an engagement.
It was believed, then, that certain aspects of the
injunction could be specific, whereas certain aspects of the
declaratory judgment might be more general in terms.
Q

You would never ask for a declaratory
*

30

judgment.
MR. GELTNER:

It was anticipated that that was the

request.
Q

Going along that line a little bit and

relating it to the relief that you were seeking, Mr. GeXtner,
suppose there had been no appeal here.
hypothetical.

This is obviously

No appeal here and you had gone back to the

district, and the district court after hearings, taking
extra testimony and what not, had decreed a set of rules for
the National Guard which were the same as those,essentially
the same as those, which are now in force by virtue of the
army regulations.

Would you think that was the kind of

relief that would be appropriate for a court of equity to
give you?
MR. GELTNER:

Among the possible appropriate

reliefs might be that.
Q

What more would you want beyond that?

MR. GELTNER:

At the time of the filing of the

complaint, as the Solicitor General has pointed out, the
rules of engagement in Ohio were highly objectionable.

It

was anticipated that we would seek either a specific order,
directed at specific items, or that the court would order
the defendants, in the event that it found wrongdoing, to
come forward with a plan for rectification of the conditions
and then enter the plan as part of its order, if it found the

31
plan to- be adequate.

It was «mticija&fced in part that it

might well be the army's rules of engagement or those
noted by Judge Edwards in his opinion below,
Q

Are there some beyond the army regulations

that you would seek in the district court, if you go back
there?
MR, GELTNER:
Q

There are numerous alternatives—

Better alternatives?

MR, GELTNER:

At this point, the rules which are

present in the appendices produced by the army are
sufficient.

But we believe that they deal only with

certain aspects of the case and, in addition, that it may
well be necessary to have them entered as an order at this
time for that specific purpose.
Q

Would it satisfy you if a court of equity

ordered, irrevocably ordered, the State of Ohio to
maintain the army rules in force?
MR. GELTNER:

Maintain the existing army rules in

force.
Q

That is the new ones, yes.

MR. GELTNER:

That would satisfy us as to the
s

bulk of our case.
between the

But we perceive a substantial difference

question of ‘whether or not the rules are in

force and the questions of whether ox- not the rules are
actually in force and enforced over a continuous period of

32
time by adequate training of the troops, by continuous
training of the troops.

Ohio, prior to the time in

question, did not nave these rules.

Ohio might well go back

to its old rules in the future.
There is nothing in the record which indicates
that Ohio has made an irrevocable decision for these rules.
The rules are not lav/.

They a.re not law in Ohio, and they

are not law in the United States.

In addition to which, as

I have said, it is basically a district court function to
determine whether or not the laguage of the rules is
actually conveyed to the troops by instruction and by order.
Q

If you have standing and if this is a

justiciable question and all the other barriers are
satisfied and the State of Ohio went back to its old rules,
couldn't you always on your theory start a new suit in
equity?
MR. GELTNER:

I suppose we could.

It has taken us

over two years now to have an adjudication, and we still
*

have not yet had a district court enter an order or decide.
I would assume that what with the complicated procedural
problems involved in a prospective course of action directed
against the Government, the district court might well see
dismissal as the logical way to act.

It is important, I

believe, to have these questions decided now, assuming as
you say, Your Honor, that this is a proper case, it is

33
justiciable and the parties do have standing.
Q

How many of your clients are .in school now?

MR. GELTNER:
graduated.

The three plaintiffs have all

The action was brought as a class action at—
Q

Who in the class is now at Kent?

MR. GELTNER:

The entire class—-the Kent State

University student body is thus represented.

None of the

three named plaintiffs are now members of the Kent stduer.t
body.
Q

Have you sought to intervene any new

plaintiffs?
MR. GELTNER:

.We have not sought, but will seek

at the district court level.
Q

We have been requested by—■

What do we have now?

Do we not need a named

plaintiff with an interest as of this moment in order to
have jurisdiction?
MR. GELTNER:
Q

I do not believe so, Your Honor.

Why not?

MR. GELTNER:

I believe at this point the

complaint stands on itself.
Q

Suppose they all dropped dead.

MR. GELTNER:
Q

At the appropriate time—

Well, Your Honor—

MR. GELTNER:

president of the student body to intervene him when we have

Q

Have you asked this Court to be permitted?

ME. GELTNER:

asked tills Court for an order.

We have not

As I have said, it is our

plan to seek substitution at the district court level, and
I believe that the cases support the proposition that, that
is the appropriate place.
Rule 25 speaks to substituting defendants at any
stage rather than substituting plaintiffs at any stage of
the proceedings.
Q

Mr. Geltner?

MR. GELTNER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I think it was Mr. Justice White who

inquired of counsel for the state whether there was any more
reason why a student, a former student, of Kent State would
have standing to bring this case than any other citizen tf
Ohio, and I do not think the question was answered.

What

ifoh Id your answer be?
MR. GELTNER:

Yes, Your Honor, I have a rat" ar

lengthy answer to that question, because it requires an
exploration of the entire standing doctrine.

P&sically this

case is a live justiciable case because of the specific

35
events.

The complaint alleges, and we believe we can prove,

■chat there were specific deprivations of constitutional
rights.

There were peopled killed, there were people shot,

there were beatings administered, there were detentions,
there were lawful assemblies broken up.

We believe we can

prove all that and we have alleged all of that,;
There is, then, a specific concrete controversy.
i

It is an event which was explored at great length by
numerous commissions.

But we believe it is highly

justiciable in nature in that it relates to specific
wrongdoing on the part of Government in the past.
The

key to the prospective aspect of the case

is this specific wrongdoing,

it is in that sense that this

case is different from several of the cases in recent years
in which the Court has found no standing because of an
absence of a past event.

That is, we are not seeking

merely guidance for the future.

We are seeking guidance

for the future arising out of a specific event.
(

The next question is, What is the nexus as to
these particular plaintiffs to this past event?

The answer

to that is complex, but basically the past event forms a
factual basis out of which we conclude

in the complaint

that a very real risk exists of repetition in the event of
future demonstrations and futura lawful assemblies.

The

plaintiffs are exposed to that as any other person on the
%

36
Kent State University campus.

But students at the Kent State

University ©aiapus at the time of the filing of this
complaint were peculiarly exposed to that risk because of
what had happened and because of the nature of the
relationship of the local police and the National Guard to
that community.
It was therefore felt, and it is still felt,
that they are peculiarly susceptible to the same kind of
conduct and that the factual basis on which a court can
act has got. to he this past conduct in which we seek to
prove that certain things were done as alleged and were
.results of the inadequacies which we allege to have led to
them.

That is what makes it a specific controversy as

opposed to a lawsuit in which a plaintiff walks into the
court and says, "I hear the Government is doing something.
I think it may affect me.

Therefore, I'd like to bring an

action."
Q

Could it have been brought by a student, say,

of Ohio State University?
MR. GELTNER:
Q

I do not believe so, Your Honor.

You would have had to have this background of

disorder and action by the Guard?
MR. GELTNER:

This is a very specific background.

There was very specific conduct, and it is very specific
conduct that we are aiming at.

And it is only a

Kent

37

State University student who is subjected to this risk.
By the same token.» though, a Kent State University
student is as much exposed to these particular risks in the
future and was at the time of the filing of the complaint
as people who had actually been subjected.

We have complained

about a bunch of diverse- constitutional deprivations, one
of which is shooting.
It is hard to see, for the purposes of prospective
relief, why the Court would want to require somebody who
was actually shot, to be the plaintiff when the key to
prospective relief is preventing future shooting.

We say

similar things about beatings and about detentions.
As to the breakup of lawful assemblies, the
complaint does not allege that these plaintiffs were
participating in the assemblies which were broken up.

As

to that, we believe the complaint does not preclude us from
proving that they were in fact participants in those lawful
assemblies.

In fact, we read the rule of Conley v. Gibson

as holding that unless your complaint establishes that yoit
are not in fact capable of proving that which entitles you
to relief, then you may not ba dismissed.
We think that the question of disentitlement as to
that item is properly a defensive matter or a matter for a
summary judgment.
Q

Is that aspect in the complaint before us

38
here?
MR» GELTNER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor*

Why is that?

You did not file a petition for

certiorari, I gather, did you?
MR. GELTNER;

That is right, Your Honor.

We did

not.
Q

And the district court or the court of

appeals just upheld your complaint insofar as it alleged the
theory of inadequate training?
MR. GELTNER:

The theory of inadequate training,

the theory of improper orders, the theory of improper
arming of the troops.
G

1 did not know that the issue hare was

whether or not the complaint stated a good cause of action
insofar as it alleged the actual breakup of assembly.
MR. GELTNER;

I do not think, Your Honor, that

that question can be avoided.

What happened in the district

court, the district judge dismissed without an opinion.

As

a result, we have really no guide as to what his thinking
was.
Judge Edwards wrote the controlling opinion, the
majority opinion, for the panel in the Sixth Circuit.
Judge Edwards split the complaint in
so.

three parts, properly

One part of the complaint deals with the claim that

a section of Ohio law, which the National Guard had read as

35

giving it an immunity was unconstitutional on its face.
-Judge Edwards construed that narrowly and dismissed it.
The other claim deals with the power of the court
to enjoin the governor of Ohio from future use of the
National Guard prematurely.

Judge Edwards dismissed that on

the grounds that it was in effect a prior restraint and not
justified.

In our brief we point out the

certiorari was not filed on that.

reasons why

Which leaves the rest cf

the complaint, which Judge Edwards ordered dismissed, and
he quotes in his opinion from the relevant paragraphs, which
he concludes stated a cause of action.
I am reading now from page 15 of the petition for
writ of certiorari which contains the opinion of the court
below.

The portion of the complaint which he finds subject

to remand are sub-parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the
controlling paragraph describing the wrongs.

Those are the

ones which describe the separate wrongs which are in issue.
And, as X have said, they are basically the shootings, the
beatings, the detentions without arrest, and the breakup of
assemblies, which we allege.
Q

Mr. Geltner, referring to Judge Edwards8

opinion, if you turn over to page 18, you see his summary of
the question which he deduces from the paragraphs you have
just mentioned.

Do you accept his statement of the question

as the substantive question before this Court, assuming we

40
get over the preliminary questions of standing and
justiciable li ty ?
MR. GELTNER:

I accept that as one of the four

substantive questions which I believe his remand puts in
issue9 Your Honor.
0

As one of—

MR. GELTNERs

One of the four.-

His statement

of that portion of the complaint which deals with the
unjustifiable killings and shootings is perfectly adequate,
and I fully accept that statement.

The other sub-paragraphs

of the complaint which he had just quoted from include
claims of unlawful and unjustified beatings, unlawful
detentions» and breakup of lawful and peaceable assemblies.
In each of those instances Judge Edwards in his opinion
italicised the key language.

When he earning to framing the

question, he framed only the question as it related to the
shootings, that is, the use of lethal force when non-lethal
force was reasonably necessary.
Q

Is that the only question that is remanded to

the district court?
MR. GELTHER:

It seems to me he has remanded all

the questions because ha goes on to hold that relief is
appropriate as to those portions of the complaint, that the
key question in part is the entitlement of one’s having
judicial forum—-hare one's claim for relief—and that those
i

41
aspects of the complaint are distinguishable from those
portions which he split off , dealt with separately, . rid
dismissed those two.
Q

He says afc the top of page 18—the language

that my Brother Powell has just referred to-—he says, i!The
question which we think these paragraphs serve to pose.”
That is all the paragraphs, (a), (b), (c>, (d).

Then he

makes a compendium summary of his understanding of all the
paragraphs.

I had thought and X understood and I gather

your brothers on the other side have understood, that what
was remanded to the district court and all that was
remanded to the district court was this question summarised
here by Judge Edwards, his opinion on page 18.
wrong about that?

Am X all

You say there are three other questions?

HR. GELTNER:

I think that Your Honor fairly

read the complaint raises three questions which are
admittedly—
Q

There are four in all.

MR. GELTNER;

Four in all.

They are subsidiary

to that raatter and that may be dealt with independently.
Q

On page 20 it says, "Further, if the District

Court after evidentiary hearing were to find from the facts
developed before it that an affirmative answer should be
made to the summary question previously phrased in this
opinion. '*

42
And then on 21:

"As to this phase of this

complaint, the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion."
I can certainly understand why the other italicized
language seemed very relevant»

But I thought the issue was

limited here to that phase of the case.
MR, GELTKER:

It may well be that Judge Edwards

saw those matters as subsidiary to the question of the
actual use of deadly weapons.
forward in the appendix
matters which relate
deadly force.

to his

In the proposal that he sets
opinion, he deals with

to much more than merely the use of

lie deals with batons.

He deals with the way

in which a mob ought to be engaged, et cetera.
It is possible to see the question

of whether or

not the National Guard is authorized to detain people, to
beat people, and more specifically to break up assemblies,
as subsidiary to the question of whether or not the way in
which it conducts itself is integral to an unreasonable risk
creation as to death

or shooting.

It is possible to see

them as subsidiary.

It is also possibleto see them as

separable.
It is otir position that the complaint should fairly
be read as treating them as separable, although I understand
that Judge Edwards’ opinion tends to see them as subsidiary.
Q

Mr. Geltner, help me out on this breaking up

43
of unlawful assembly.

Under your ideas of what you want,

who decides whether it is lawful or unlawful?
hr.

GELTNER:

The court issues an order.

Thereat'ter, the—
Q

And the order says what?

MR. GELTNSR:

The order enjoins the defendants

from ordering or permitting their troops to break up
lawful and peaceable assemblies.
Q

Are they not already under that injunction

by the laws of the land?
MR. GELTNERs

Wot for purposes of the contempt

power of the court, Your Honor.

It is our position, for

example, that the defendants did in fact break up at least
two lawful and peaceable assemblies.
other than the contempt power of

a

I know of no mechanism
United States district

court which would give any of the plaintiffs or their
representatives the ability to call the defendants to task
for that.

It is our belief that the injunction is

necessary.
Q

Then the governor and all of his authorities

have to make a judgment as to whether this is lawful or
unlawful, subject to the contempt priorities of the court?
MR. GELTNER:

On the ground, Your Honor, that they

have in fact broken up lawful assemblies in the past, that is,
acted unlawfully.

(

Q

May I tarry cn the suggestion

of your

friends there; what case do you have for that point?
MR. GELTNER:
Q

Hague v. C.I.Q., Your Honor.

Hague v. C.I.O.?

MR. GELTNER:

Which opinion?

The opinion of the Supreme Court

which incorporated in part the opinion-—
Q

Which one?

Q

There was no opinion of the Supreme Court in

that case.
i

MR. GELTNER:

Thera were four opinions of the

Court.
Q

Yes, no opinion of the Court.

MR. GELTNER:

My recollection is that—-at one

point in my brief I have traced down the—I have got it in
a footnote here, have I not?

I see six notes on the Court

for the proposition that the assembly—that the breakup of
an unlawful assembly is a deprivation of a constitutional
right and that a court may act in its equity jurisdiction to
enjoin that future conduct.

And, if 1 can find the

appropriate page, Justice Roberts for himself and Justice
Black; Justice Stone for himself and Justice Reed and Chief
Justice Hughes.

Five of them, I am sorry, Your Honor.

Justice Douglas and Justice Frankfurter did not participate,
and 1 guess that leaves us with three dissenters.
five votes, two dissenters.

So, I see

I see five votes for that

45
proposition, all of whom were agreed, although I recognize
that Justice Stone ;/ot there a different way.

And that is

the basis for our proposition.
Thereafter, of course, the district courts and
the circuit courts have expanded to a great extent on that
power.
I

Q

Suppose you were sitting as a court and you

had an assembly of a thousand people, one of them threw a
rock; would that be an unlawful assembly?
answer, I am going to ask
MR. GELTNER:

And before you

you the next one:

How many rocks?

Your Honor, I can grant you one

rock, Your Honor, which will mean a crime.

That would not

be a riot under Ohio law—
Q
law7.

We are not talking about riots under Ohio

We are talking about a very nice phrase called

"lawful assembly."

And would laxtfful assembly be one in which

one rock was thrown?
MR. GELTNER:

The Constitution does not protect

an assembly in which rocks or a rock are thrown.
Q

So, if one rock was thrown, it would not be

protected?
MR. GELTNER:
Q
if anybody

That is right.

So, then, the Government issues an order that
throws one rock, shoot.

MR. GELTNER:

You have changed the facts on me.

46

Q

Do you want that law?

MR. GELTNER:
question is:

No, we do not want that law..

May the assembly be broken up as a consequence

of one act of violence?
and I think it can be.
is:

The

I think that, is a fair question,
But the other side of the question

May the assembly be broken up as a result of no acts of

violence?

I think the answer to that one has got to be no.
Q

It is a factual point.

MR. GELTNER:

Exactly.

It is purely a factual

point,
It is likewise true that we allege as a factual
matter that defendants did break up a lawful assembly and
we plan to prove that the assemblies were in fact wholly
lawful and wholly peaceful at the time the National Guard
did break them up.
Q

And that assembly, so far as you know, will

never occur again.
MR. GELTNER:
Q

The conditions—

Has it?

MR. GELTNER:

That particular assembly?

Other

assemblies have occurred.
Q

Has any other

lawful assembly occurred on

Kent State?
MR. GELTNER:

Q

Yas, Your Honor.

And has it been disturbed?

MR. GELTNER:
Q

It has bean disturbed?

MR. GELTNER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Where is that in the complaint?

MR. GELTNER:
Q

Yes, Year Honor

I left it out, Your Honor.

Why did you leave that out?

MR. GELTNER:

It occurred after the date of the

complaint, Your Honor.

It is not our fault—I have taken

the position—
Q

What do we have in the record in this case

that entitles the class-”&nd what is the class as of new?
MR. GELTNER:

The class as of now consists of all

students at Kent State University,
Q

Which is a different class from when it was

filed.
MR. GELTNER;

Which consists of different persons

from when it was filed,
Q

And if we take a year to decide it, it will

be still another class.
MR. GELTNER:
Q

Different persons, same class.

Different persons, same class.

MR. GELTNER:

It is in the nature of the class.

The key to class action under Rule 23 {fo}(2) is prospective
relief.

Is it likely the defendants will act toward the

entire class in a way such as to justify prospective relief?

48
That is the key to the whole complaint.
Q

You do agree that two-thirds of what bovh

sides have told us or 80 pereant of things that were not
before the district court—
MR. GELTNER:

Your Honor» we are in a difficult

position here because of the fact that all we have got is a
bare complaint.

It would be much preferable if we had a

record to deal with but we do not.

And» therefore, what

we have got to do is deal 'with inferences.
rest on the sufficiency of the complaint.

We are willing to
I do not think it

is terribly proper for me to come here and try to tell the
Court that we can prove things which are beyond the face
of the complaint, but—
Q

Why are you not willing to rest on these

new regulations?
MR. GELTNER;

That is the contrary point.

We

believe, first of all, as a matter of law, that because- of
the wrongdoing, because of the very specific acts, even if
these regulations are legitimate, they should foe entered as
an order and an order or declaratory judgment should be
entered so as to preclude any return to the old ways.

In

that sense, controversy is not mooted.
Q

Would that satisfy you?

MR. GELTNER:
us.

That would go very far to satisfying

49
Q

That is not my question.

MR. GELTNER:
Q

The other aspect of it—

You are asking, then, if you say it should be

entered as an order of the district court in the form of a
declaratory judgment—“if that were to be done, that would
require that we decide all of these constitutional issues,
standing, justiciability, and so forth,
I®. GELTNER:
Honor.

That is absolutely right. Your

Standing, justiciability, the absence of mootness

are prerequisites to this Court’s acting or it is a
continuation in the action by the district court.
Q

I understood, Mr. Geltner—and you tell zse

if I misunderstood—you to answer the question my Brother
Marshall just asked you a while ago, and the question was
phrased in a somewhat different way by the Chief Justice,
that, assuming that you are right, that these threshold
issues are not. obstacles and get over them, get to the merits,
that you really would not be satisfied even then by an order
of a court putting in permanently the present directives to
the National Guard because, while that might be all right on
paper, you are concerned with the actual pattern of
training.

Is not that what you said to the Chief Justice?
MS. GELTNER:

That is absolutely right. Your

Honor.
*

Q

And, therefore, you would say that the

50

district court has to get out there every week for two
hours and watch—
MR. GELTNER:
enter an order.

The district court has got to

itself available for counsel to bring to its attention any

How are counsel going to know without

getting out there with the National Guard on their weekends

Or is the court to send a master- out there?

MR. GELTNER;

No, I believe that counsel can be

authorised to marshal periodically the nature of the
training and to make available to the Court whatever
evidence is necessary.
Q

How is this going to be done?

MR. GELTNER;

It could be done by access.

It

could be done by permitting counsel to come forward and
produce witnesses.

A motion for contempt is ordinarily

subject to proof before the court, or a motion for
modification can be similarly subject.

Courts have

traditionally, and increasingly over the last few years,
given injunctive relief which requires the injunction to be
administered.

I am a little curious as to hew it is that

really know what the content is of the training when the

court sends a master or a referee out there,

All X would say, Your Honor,

is that over the past few years, I have corae to know an
awful lot about what the Ohio National Guard is doing on a
relatively ongoing basis as the result of the availability
of witnesses.

It is not a secret

organisation.

Its people are part-time soldiers.

They are

soldiers on weekends and for a couple of weeks during the
summer.

And during the rest of the time—they are not sworn

to any oath of secrecy.

What guidelines do you use for adequacy of

52

the training?
MR. GELTNER;

We believe that we can produce

expert witnesses to testify as to the training as to whether
or not it is adequate, whereupon the court can become
convinced whether there is or is not adequate training.
Q

Do you know what would be adequate?

MR. GELTNER:

I personally am not an expert.

We

have consulted with experts—
Q

Do you think the district court would be an

expert?
MR. GELTNER;

The district court can be made an

expert to the extent that it is in any other context by
expert witnesses.
Q

That is a district judge who does not knoitf

the difference between a bazooka and a pea shooter?
MR. GELTNER;

Your Honor, courts hear medical

expert witnesses on a daily basis.

District judges decide

patent cases involving complicated problems of organic
chemistry without having taken a chemistry course in
college.
Q

In the meantime, the National Guard has got

all of you all over the lot watching everything they do and
at the same time they are trying to train somebody for
combat.
MR. GELTNER;

Your Honor, it does not strike me as

53

a very substantial interference with the' National Guard
conduct in the context of the fact that we have alleged and
hope to prove that the National Guard in Ohio has been
responsible for some very serious deprivations of
constitutional rights.

We believe that in that context the

interference would be justified»
Q

And the officers of the National Guard have

been responsible for it?

and a factual record made, then this Court would have before
it questions of the adequacy of the training, questions
••

which relate to the standing of the plaintiffs, specifically
a factual record on the question of
Q

imminence.

If the district judge concluded either that

there was no standing or that there was no justiciable
question presented or that the issue was moot or all three,
then

he should not take any evidence, should he?
MR. GELTNER:

That is right, Your Honor, except

for the fact that the question of mootness-—as the Court
framed the issue of mootness in the W, T. Grant case, there
are really two senses in which a case can become moot.
first sense is a pure, outright change of lav;.

The

Hall v.

Beals is an example of that kind of case, in which the
Court concluded that the law had changed and therefor® the
controversy no longer existed.
The second situation is a situation in which the
claim is put forth that that which was highly likely at a
preceding time is no longer highly likely because of a
change in circumstance.

That is a factual issue.

It is an

56

issue to be decided by a district judge.,

A district judge,

as we all know, has discretion in granting injunctive
relief, and can very well deny injunctive relief on the
ground that while he has found wrongdoing, he now finds
that the circumstancas are not such as to warrant the entry
of an injunction.
Q

That is a district judge’s function.

Would it be a fair characterization of your

position that if the case goes back to the district court,
you do not quarrel with the specific regulations now in
force but (a) you want them made permanent and (b) you want
a continuing surveillance to see that they are carried out?
is that a fair statement of your case?
MR. GELTNER:

Yes, Your Honor, that is a fair

statement of what we are seeking at this point, understanding
that at the time the complaint was filed we ware seeking a
more specific change in what then existed.
There is one further point which has come up on
a couple of occasions that I have never really specifically
addressed myself to, and that is the relationship of
Laird, v, Tatum to this case.

The Solicitor General in his

brief has gone to some length to demonstate the way in which
this case is like Laird.

We think this case is different

from kaird in several respects.
Laird was basically a case in which the conduct
of the defendants was not in itself unlawful and did not in

*

57
itself involve a deprivation of a constitutional right, but
it was allaged that ths chilling effect of the defendant's
conduct created a deprivation of a constitutional right.
So, what it was was an attempt to bootstrap from .an injury
into a deprivation of a right.
Irrespective of what I personally may think about
that in the privacy area, this case is crucially different.
First of all, it is different in the sense that the people
that are subjected to the kinds of injury that occurred
here and which we see as possibly occurring in the future
are the opposite of people who are going to be chilled.
They are the people who actually participate in the
assemblies.

And so we believe that, first of all, chilling

effect as to these people is really not pertinent to the
question of injury hers or to the question of whether or
not the complaint states a wrong.

That is the first way in

which the case is different from Laird.
The second way in which the case is different
from Laird lies in the fact that this case alleges injury
which is very specific in nature and which has been held by
preceding cases to give rise to a constitutional deprivation.
That is, one who is unjustifiably killed by government
action is in fact subjected to a deprivation of a
constitutional right,

So that the inquiry into the

defendant’s conduct stems from a specific constitutional

58
right as opposed to the Laird case in which th-are is no
specific constitutional right but the subjective feeling of
injury is said to be enough to lead to the finding of the
constitutional deprivation.

I think that is a very

substantial difference.
One further aspect of Laird to which I would like
to call the Court5s attention, and that is the assumption
that the—the assumption present in this case, which vre
have come to on a couple of other occasions—that the nature
of the training will be adequate to assure that the new
rules of engagement are in fact brought forth to the
troops.

We have heard a good deal in the way of assurances

from the defendants—there is more in the briefs.

And what

we see in Laird about this is that • very similar kinds of
assurances were made to the Court at that time.

Specifically

they were assurances with respect to the retention of
documents and et cetera.

It was than found by a Senate

committee that the documents had not in fact been retained.
i

We believe that all of these matters, matters
with respect to what the orders are and how they are
implemented, are purely matters of truth and therefore
specifically functions of a district rather than an
appellate court.
