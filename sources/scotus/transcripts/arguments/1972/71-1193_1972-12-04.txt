MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in No, 71-1193, United States against Enmons.
Mr. Reynolds, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ.,
MR, REYNOLDS;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
This case is here on direct appeal front the
dismissal of an indictment by the United States District.
Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,

The indictment,

which is set forth in the jurisdictional statement at
Appendix C, pages 12a to 16a, contains a single count
charging the several .named defendant appellees with
conspiring among themselves and with two others to obstruct,
delay, and affect interstate commerce and the movement in
commerce of electrical energy and other articles and
commodities by extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1951,
Which is the so-called Hobbs Act, and with committing
physical violence to property in furtherance of said plan
to obstruct, delay, and affect commerce.
The damaged property consisted of four separate
transformer substations, all located in the State of
Louisiana and owned and operated by Gulf States Utilities
Company,

The company supplies electrical energy to the

4
State of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, and the
transformer substations involved here were connected to and
part of an interstate electrical network.

Moreover,

materials necessary for construction and maintenance of the
damaged facilities moved in interstate commerce»
The appellees were at the time of the indictment
members and officers of one or the other of two union
locals of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, which represented employees of Gulf States and
employees of independent contractors employed by Gulf States.
During the period in question, the union members
were on strike against Gulf States in an effort to secure a
contract which, among other things, called for higher wages.
The indictment charges that appellees and their co-conspirator
conspired to obtain property of Gulf States in the form of
wages and other things of value by inducing the company and
its officers to agree to the aforementioned contracts
through the wrongful use of actual force, violence, and fear
of economic injury, to wit, committing acts of physical
violence and destruction against property owned by Gulf
States. •
Five separate acts of violence are described in
the indictment.

On October 30, 1969, two of the co­

conspirators allegedly fired a high-powered rifle into a
transformer substation owned by the company, the so-called

5
Alcyn

Substation.

Approximately ten days later * on or

about November 10, 1969c two others fired a high-powered
rifle into another transformer substation of the company
known as the Lindsey Substation»

About a month later on

#

December 9, 1969, the Lindsey Substation was fired on again
by some of the co-conspirators.

And on the same day, it is

alleged that yet another transformer substation had the oil
drained from it so that it malfunctioned.
Hudson Substation.

That was the Port

Then on June 2, 1970, the co-conspirators

allegedly blew up the Sandy Creek Substation of the company,
using 12 sticks of dynamite.
Appellees moved in the district court to dismiss
the indictment on the ground that the allegations therein
do not constitute an offense under the Hobbs Act.
district court granted the motion.

The

He construed the statute

as not covering acts of force and violence when used in
furtherance of a legitimate labor objective

such as the

obtaining of higher wages for company employees.
Since the indictment in this case was returned on
October 15, 1970, prior to the effective date of the 1971
amendment to the Criminal Appeals Act, the United States
appealed directly to this Court under former Section 3731 of
Title IS, because a dismissal order was based on the
district court’s construction of the underlying statute,
that is, the Hobbs Act.

6
At the outset* it should be observed that the
Hobbs Act is not an anti-labor statute.
directed only at labor union activity.

It is not a statute
It is, as are all

criminal statutes, aimed at certain conduct.

Its prohibition

reaches, and I quote "whoever in any way or degree obstructs,
delays, or affects commerce,8” and the statute defines
commerce to include all commerce between a point in a state
and a point outside thereof, "where the movement of any
article or commodity in commerce by robbery or

extortion

or whoever attempts or conspires so to do or commits or
threatens physical violence to any person or property in
furtherance of a plan or purpose so to do."
First, let me say that there is no dispute in this
case that the indictment alleges acts sufficient to show a
conspiracy to interfere with commerce within the meaning of
the statute.

Thus, the issue here concerns only whether the

allegations of the indictment demonstrate that appellees9
interference with commerce was in furtherance of a plan to
extort.
Q

Mr. Reynolds, I take it that there is nothing

in the record which discloses whether the wages sought in
this economic strike would be regarded as excessive or as
something that is normally requested in an economic strike?
am I correct?
MR. REYNOLDS;

No, Your Honor.

The indictment

7
alleges that the contract call for higher wages and other
monetary benefits, but there is nothing in the record to
indicate whether the request for wages, either in the
contract or otherwise, were excessive»
Q

I take it then you are driven in your

position to any violence really in connection with inter­
state commerce is regarded as extortion under the Hobbs
ilefe?
MR,, REYNOLDS:
our position is that»

No, Your Honor, I do not believe
I think directly to your point, wages

or money in the hands of an employer that is demanded as
earned wages is, we believe, properly within the meaning of
the extortion provision, and as 1 understand appellees®
brief, they do not contend otherwise, and we believe that
when you are negotiating for a contract for higher wages,
those wages are still the property of the employer»
employee has no right to those wages»

The

And our position is

not affected by whether the wages, the demand for wages, is
excessive or not excessive»
As to the question of whether any violence at all,
I would like to, if 1 could, come back to that in a second»
The Hobbs Act defines extortion to mean, and I
quote, "the obtaining of property from another with his
consent induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened
force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right»'1

Looking intially just at that language, it is
strikingly unambiguous*
an obtaining of property*

The first element of the offense is
Congress did not say, as

appellees have urged in their brief, a misappropriation of
property.

Nor did it use the phrase, and 1 quote, "an

unlawful taking of property" as it did in defining the term
robbery in this statute.

It said simply an obtaining of

property.
Second,

the property to be obtained must be

received from another with his consent.

And.that consent

must have been induced by wrongful means, including the
wrongful use of force, violence, or fear.
Q

Let me get back to where I am troubled.

If

a man threw a stone through a window of the office building,
is this covered by the Hobbs Act?
MR. REYNOLDS %

Your Honor, I think that that

particular act would not sustain a Hobbs Act conviction.
The Hobbs Act is a criminal statute, and it requires
criminal intent as an element of the offense.

I think that

often during the course of a strike violence will erupt and
you will have a spontaneous outburst or, as the Ninth
Circuit said in the Caides and Lowery case, a byproduct of
a frustration engendered by a prolonged collective bargaining
negotiation.

That may technically fit within language of

the statute, but I think that before yon can return a

9

conviction, it must be established that the perpetrator of
the violence, the«e who threw the stone through the window,
for example, had the criminal intent by his violent act to
induce the victim

to part with a property that is obtained»

And I do not think in your example that you would be able to
prove to a jury that the criminal intent was present»
Q

There has to be robbery or extortion or a

conspiracy to rob or extort, does there not?
MR» REYNOLDS?
Q

That is correct, Your Honor»

Violence alone is certainly not enough»

MR» REYNOLDS %
statute is aimed at»

Violence alone is not what the

And 1 think that you do need that

element of a criminal intent to coerce the employer to part
with the property.
Q

By robbery or extortion»

MR. REYNOLDS:
Q

By robbery or extortion»

Can you not have all of those things with

throwing a rock through the window?
MR, REYNOLDS?.

You could have all of those things,

1 believe, but that is a matter for the jury to decide, and
it is not a matter—
Q

What you really mean, I guess, is

how you

ever, would instruct a jury as to the distinction between
using dynamite and throwing a rock through the window..
MR» REYNOLDS s

I do not think that there is a

10
distinction.

I think what you have to instruct the jury on

is the question of criminal intent, whether the perpetrators9
intent by this act of violence, be it a rock through a
window or dynamite, was to extort, and that is, as in every
criminal statute, that element of criminal intent is for the
jury.

Here we do not reach that problem

because we have

a dismissal of an indictment and the question is—
Q

Let me change the facts a little bit, add

additional facts.

Suppose at a point during the•economic

negotiations the union negotiator said—and this is part of
the evidence that 1 am hypothesizing—that if we don't get
agreement by the end of this week, you won't have much of
a plant left.

And then following that utterance, you had not

one but 30 or 40 men heaving bricks through all of the
windows of the plant and onto the machinery.

You would have

your intent, the nexus between the negotiations and the
violence, would you not?
MR. REYNOLDS;
Q

1 believe you would.

Would that be Hobbs Act?

M51. REYNOLDS;

I believe that that, as you stated

it, would sustain a Hobbs Act conviction.

I think that the

appellee's argument is that the Hobbs Act reaches only those
wrongful uses of force and violence that are aimed at an
illegitimate objective.

And if the objective is legitimate,

then the Hobbs Act cannot reach it.

11
Q

Mr» Reynolds, let me come back„ before you go

on, to Mr. Justice Blackmon1 s question.

You say that the

throwing the stone through the window by the single man would
be a question for the jury.
indictment

I take it here too, if this

were sustained, it is still the Government’s job

to convince a jury.

Do I understand you are right in thinking

that an indictment could be drawn under the Hobbs Act that
would withstand a motion to dismiss in which you allege that
a single individual threw a stone through the window of a
plant and that he intended thereby to extort property?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think there is always a question

of whether on the facts a jury could reasonably infer that the
act was intended.
whether

I think there

is also another element of

it could reasonably be inferred from the acts that

the victim would have been coerced or induced by that
particular act to part with the property.

And if may be that

you could dismiss an indictment where it could not be
reasonably determined on the basis of the facts alleged that
a jury could find the requisite intent.
I think as a general matter that Congress did not
intend to confine the scope of the Hobbs Act to wrongful use
of violence for illegitimate objectives.

The racketeer, for

•example, who threatens to destroy a man's bowling alley if the
victim does npt agree to install his pinball machine or his
jukebox certainly comes within the extortion definition of the

12

Hobbs Act.

So too does the individual who through threats

of physical or personal violence forces a competitor to sell
to him a portion of the business.

In each of those instances,

the end is not itself an illegitimate objective.

Had the

racketeer obtained permission to install his pinball machine
through negotiation or had he confined his efforts to expand
his business through lawful competition, there would be no
offense under the Hobbs Act.

But it is the unlawful means

used that bring it within the act's definition.
Appellees' position thus must be that what Congress
intended,, although it did not say so in the language of the
statute# was a special exemption from the extortion
prohibition for members of labor unions# if their wrongful
use of force or violence is in furtherance of a legitimate
labor objective such as the obtaining of a contract for
higher wages.
That# of course# was precisely the case under the
predecessor statute to the Hobbs Act# the anti-racketeering
act of 1934.

By its terms it specifically excluded from its

coverage the actual or threatened use of force, violence# or
coercion to obtain "the payment of wages from a bona fide
employer to a bona fide employee."
In United States v. Local 807# at 315 U.S.# this
Court held that that exclusionary provision in the 1934 act
was to be construed broadly so as to protect those who were

13
actually employees as well as those seeking the status of
employees»

Their acts of violence in that case against out-

of-state truckers to compel them to pay the union members
upon entering New York City the equivalent of what would ba
a day's wage for unloading the trucks—their acts of violence
were considered beyond the scope or the reach of the anti­
racketeering act if their objective was to obtain the payment
of wages»
Congress responded to the Local 807 decision by
rewriting the anti-racketeering act»
Q

In your view that takes the three-fifteen

case out of this problem?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I believe that does take the three-

fifteen case out of the problem. Your Honor»
Tha Congress did not simply narrow the exemption
in the 1934 statute after Local 807 so that the term bona
fide employee would apply solely to employees seeking wages
for actual services rendered»

It did not leave intact an

exemption for those bona fide employees seeking to obtain
the payment of wages by coercion as opposed to force and
violence»

Efforts to amend the anti-racketeering act along

such lines were 'unsuccessful»

What Congress did was enact

a whole new statute, the Hobbs Act.

It eliminated entirely

the exemption for those seeking a payment of wages.

It also

deleted the provision in the 1934 act which stated that wages

14
were not included in the statutory terra property.

The

prohibition was rewritten to proscribe any interference by
anyone with interstate commerce by robbery or extortion.
Andj as I have earlier pointed out, the term "extortion" was
defined in terms of the wrongful means used without, regard to
whether the objective of the extortioner was or was not
otherwise legitimate.
Even without reference to the legislative history,
it is plain from a comparison of the 1934 anti-racketeering
act and the Hobbs Act of 194S that Congress intended by the
new statute to eliminate any exemption based on the fact, as
is the case here, that the objective of the one'who is using
actual or threatened force or violence is to obtain the wages
from a bona fide employer.

And this is precisely the point

that members of Congress made over and over again in the
legislative debate.
Congressman Hobbs,, the principal sponsor of the bill
that was enacted into legislation, perhaps stated it most
succinctly.

He said, and I quotes

"This bill is grounded on

the bedrock principle that crime is crime no matter who
commits it, and that robbery is robbery and extortion
extortion whether or not the perpetrator has a union card.
It covers whoever in any way or degree interferes with
interstate or foreign commerce by robbery or extortion."
This Court has already had occasion to review the

15
legislative history of the Hobbs Act.

It did so in United

States v. Greeny at 350 U.S., and concluded, and again I
quote:

"The legislative history makes clear that the new

act was meant to eliminate any grounds for future judicial
conclusions that Congress did not intend to cover the
employer/employee relationship.

The words were defined to

avoid any misunderstanding."
Just as the plain language of the statute reveals
no basis for according to union members the special
protection urged by appellees, so too there is nothing in the
legislative history of the Hobbs Act to support their
position.

They rely essentially on a number of statements

made on the floor of the House to the effect that the new
statute was not intended to reach legitimate labor activity
or "demands" for higher wages.

And so it was not.

But when

that otherwise legitimate labor activity or those demands are
combined with the type of violence that is alleged in this
indictment, they assume a wholly different character.

In this

regard, the Green decision is particularly relevant to the
instant case.

There the district court construed the indict­

ment as charging an attempt to obtain from the employer money
in the form of wages for made work, that is, work actually to
be performed as distinguished from standby services, which is
the performance of so work at all.

That construction was not

contested by the Government on its appeal to this Court.

Thus

16
the Green indictment, just as the indictment here, charged
the defendant with wrongful 'use of force and violence in an
effort to obtain a legitimate labor objective.

This Court

held that the indictment charged interference with commerce
by extortion within the meaning of the act.
and I quotes

It said this,

"Title Two of the Hobbs Act provides that the

provisions of the act shall not affect the Clayton Act, the
Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Railway labor Act, or the National
Labor Relations Act,

There is nothing in any of those acts,

however, that indicates any protection for unions or their
officials in attempts to get personal property
threats of force or violence*

through

Those are not legitimate means

for improving labor conditions,"
Similarly here, the shooting and dynamiting of
Gulf states5 transformer substations are not legitimate means
for obtaining from the company higher wages and other
monetary benefits.

The fact that that objective could perhaps

have been achieved through lawful collective bargaining
negotiations provides no basis for immunising appellees”
chosen course of conduct from criminal punishment under the
Hobbs Act,

They are enfc.it3.ed to no different treatment from

the racketeer who attempts by force and violence to induce
the proprietor of a bowling alley to install his pinball
machine or his jukebox.

In both instances, because of the

wrongful means used, the obtaining of property is extortion,

17
and Congress intended to reach such extortionist activity
whoever the perpetrator if, as charged here, it has an adverse
effect on interstate commerce <>
The question of whether these appellees actually
intended by their acts of violence to induce Gulf States to
agree to a contract calling for higher wages, as is alleged
in the indictment, is a matter for the jury to decide.

We

believe the district court’s dismissal order, which deprived
the jury of an opportunity to pass on the question of
appellees5 criminal intent was an error and that it should be
reversed»
Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Reynolds.

Mr. Dunau.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD DUNAU, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. DUNAU:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

There is a strike, there is violence in the course
of this strike.

The violence is said to be shooting a rifle

into three substations, dynamiting a substation, draining the
oil from an electrical transformer.
strike itself, has a purpose.

That, violence, like the

The purpose is to get a union

contract calling for higher wages and other monetary benefits.

18
The dynamiting, the shooting, the draining of oil are wrongs.
They are punishable in Louisiana where the acts are alleged
to have occurred sis aggravated arson, arson, criminal mischief
to property, aggravated criminal mischief to property.

No

one claims that these are not punishable offenses and
seriously punishable.

Our question is whether in addition

to have Louisiana and every other state in the union which has
like laws punishing such conduct, whether in addition to that
Congress has made such conduct, strike violence, a crime by
calling it extortion within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.

It

will be helpful, I think, before we address the Hobbs Act
specifically, to look at what it means to say that strike
violence constitutes a crime of extortion.
Q

I suppose that what you have just said could

be said with equal accuracy and force on the federal statute
that relates to using coercion to—the loan-sharking statute
is the one I am thinking of.

The conduct there would be a

state offense too, would it not?
MR. DURAO:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But Congress thought that it needed federal

protection because of the interstate factor and within the
last year or so we have sustained that, have we not?
MR. DUNAD's

We have no doubt of the constitutional

power of Congress to reach strike violence as a federal
crime when it affects interstate commerce.

Our question is

19
whether Congress did do so.

And indecidihg whether or not

Congress did do so, I think it is pertinent to look at some
of the considerations Congress must be said to have resolved
in making strike violence a federal crime.
Strike violence is criminally punishable in every
state.

It is civilly remedial in every state.

It is

traditionally within the control of state criminal jurisdic­
tion.

We are therefore asked to say that the Congress in

establishing a crime called extortion and robbery has made a
major federal encroachment into a traditional state domain
and there 'can be nothing more traditional than maintenance of
law and order, the proscription of violence.
Q

I suppose this conduct could be the subject

of an unfair labor practice charge too under some circum­
stances?

■■
MR.' DUNAU:

•"

'

If--it can be said to have ■'■.interfered

with the right of employees to refrain from strike activity,
it would constitute a violation of Section 8(b) (1)(A) of the
National Labor Relations Act as intimidation, coercion to
restrain employees from refraining from strike activity.
And it was only to that marginal, limited degree that Congress
has ever entered the field of strike violence.

Indeed, when

we look to what Congress in fact thinks the appropriate
scope of federal and state authority in this area is, we have
a. very good indication by looking at what the Norris-LaGuardia

20
Act says.

The Worris--LaGuardia Act prohibits a federal court

from issuing an injunction in a labor dispute.
exception.

It makes an

A federal court may issue an injunction to

restrain fraud or violence, but there has to be a specific
finding before a federal court can do that.

The finding must

be that the public officers charged with the duty to protect
complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish
adequate protection.

Only if you can show a breakdown of

state protection can a federal court enter this arena even by
civil means.

Wa are asked, therefore, to believe that no

federal court can act in this are4 to issue a strike
injunction against violence without a showing of a breakdown
of state protection that nevertheless that same federal court
can send people to jail for 20 years for the conduct which it
cannot civilly restrain.

We do not think that is the way to

read a congressional statute or to ascertain congressional
meaning»
In this case, if this kind of conduct, if strike
violence can be reached by the Hobbs Act, then every act of
strike violence from the fist fight to murder, from a
deflated tire to arsonf becomes the work of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, of the United States Attorneys, of
federal judges and federal juries.
Q

Did not the Green, case deal with that Norris-

LaGuardia point that you were just making?

I assume you were

21
referring to the Norris-LaGuardia Act when you suggested that
this was a criminal act which could not be reached by civil
injunction.
MR» DUNAUs

The great difference between the Green

case and this case is that in Green you had conventional
extortion.

In Green the indictment alleges that forced was

used to get money from the employer for imposed, unwanted,
superfluous and fictitious services,

if the services are

imposed and unwanted, the employer has rejected them.

If

they are fictitious and superfluous, they are no work or a
sham substitution for no work,

if you use violence to get

from an employer that for which you give him nothing in
return, if you take money from him and give him no work,, that
is extortion.

The whole difference between Green and this

case is the world of difference between getting money or
seeking money for desired, valuable, and. wanted work, which
the Government is now telling us is extortion and getting
money for imposed, unwanted, and superfluous fictitious
services which we agree in the conventional sense is
extortion because you. are using violence to get from another
that which you have no right to have at all.
Q

Suppose a man had some money in the bank and

it was subject to a garnishment, and he did not understand
or agree

with the garnishment process, on the theory of your

last argument, he cams into the bank and shot the place up

22
in protest against their refusing to allow withdrawals.
Would you not have an analogous situation?
to the money ultimately in some form,

He is entitled

I am going at your

argument that the application of the act turns on whether
there is entitlement to the money or no entitlement,
MR. DUNAU;

In our view, the application of the

act turns on whether you have, one, a felonious mis­
appropriation of property, stealing, larceny, plus violence,
that you need the conjunction of the two to make out
extortion and that when you are seeking a union contract
calling for higher wages and other monetary benefits,
whatever else you may do, you are not misappropriating
property, you are not stealing, you are not engaging in
larceny.

What you are seeking is to fix the price of the

work that is to be performed.
When the employer enters into a union contract, he
makes a promise to pay for work to be performed for him.
When he gives up his money, he gives up money in exchange foxwork he wants done.

Wow, an employer and a union can foe at

loggerheads with each other as to how much should be paid
for the work to be performed.
less,

The employer may want to pay-

The worker may want more.

But the employer is no more

having his property misappropriated when he wants to pay the
worker less for the work he wants performed than the worker
is having his labor misappropriated when the employer does not

23
want to pay him more than the worker thinks it is worth»
Q

Mr. Dunau, suppose the issue in a strike is

the so-called feather-bedding issue.

What would your

position be?
MR. DUMMJs

We think that the Hobbs Act reaches

only the wages for the performance of no work or sham
substitution or no work.

We do not believe that it reaches

a claim that the work to be performed is useless.

We think

that is outside the scope of the Hobbs Act as it is outside
the scope of Section 8(b)(6) of the National Labor Relations
Act.

But if there is any quarrel as to the scope of the

Hobbs Act, it relates only to whether it reaches only, as
we claim, to wages for the performance of no work or the
sham substitution for no work or whether it also reaches
make-work, useless work.

But if it reaches useless work or

if that is where our fall is, it precisely demonstrates what
the Hobbs Act does not reach.

Because what we have here is

no claim that you have no work performed? we have no claim
that you have useless work.

What we have is a claim that

when you seek a union contract to get higher wages and other
monetary benefits for work which the employer wants performed,
which is useful to him, which he desires, that this is
nevertheless extortion.
Under no stretch of the imagination, 1 think, can
one say in interpreting a criminal statute that where the

24
only quarrel that one can have in terras of the reach of a
statute is, Does it go beyond no work to reach made work,
that then you jump from made work to work which is valuable
to and desired by the employer?
Q

Is the test that you are suggesting—does it

have anything to do with what is or what is not a compulsory
subject of collective bargaining under the federal labor
laws?

7 should suppose it does have to do with that , does

it not?

You are not contending that your clients had a

right to this money, but you are contending that they had a
perfectly legitimate right to ask for this money, as
contrasted with a traditional extortionist,, are you not?
MR. DUNMJs

We are certainly claiming that we have

a right to bargain for higher wages—
Q

You are not claiming you had a right to the

money as a matter of legal right,* you had a right to demand
it,, that this was a subject of compulsory bargaining.
MR. DIMAUs

Correct.

No one has any right to

money, even when a collective bargaining agreement is
executed.

The only right to money you get is when the work

is performed.

So, all we have—and. what, we have here, we

are at the inner core of mandatory bargaining, namely,
negotiation for higher wages and. other monetary—
Q

Is the test whether or not this is the subject

of mandatory bargaining under the federal labor lews?

Is

25
that the test that you would propose?

Perhaps you have not

thought of that.
MR. DUNAU:

We have made the argument that this

cannot he a Hobbs Act violation, because what we are dealing
with is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.
Q

But is that an exclusive definition?

MR. DUNAU:
Q

Mo, sir.

We think that—

Why not?

MR. DUNAUs

Because we think that the definition

which is required under this

statute and defining the

elements of extortion is whether yon have a felonious
misappropriation of property, larceny, stealing.
what we think the test is.

That is

In applying that test, we think

that any subject which would be a mandatory subject of
bargaining cannot possibly then be converted into money which
we cannot seek, money which we are stealing.

But I am

unwilling to say, because I have not thought of the parameters
of saying it is only mandatory bargaining? I am unwilling to
say that something beyond mandatory bargaining would
therefore fall within the misappropriation concept which we
think is the limiting concept under the Hobbs Act.
Q

Perhaps over the luncheon period you might

think of the parameters of that? would you?
MR. DUNAU;
Q

Yes, Your Honor, I shall.

Mr. Dunau, you used the term "misappropriate.”

26
Of course, 1951(b)(2) defines extortion as meaning the
obtaining of property.

Do you think misappropriate and

obtain are synonyms in this sense?
MR. DUNAUs

I think in this statute they are*,

because 1 think that when you talk about extortion and then
define extortion, that if we look traditionally to what we
mean by extortion and what we mean by robbery, we mean a
compound offense, the taking of property unlawfully, and we
mean wrongful means to effectuate that taking.

In that

history, in that concept, when the words "obtaining property
from another” are used, we think they must, be translated to
mean the felonious misappropriation of property.

If it

means something else, then it is a departure from our
conventional concepts of robbery and extortion, and we should
expect a very clear indication from Congress that they want
something different from what we normally expect when w© deal
with an extortion and a robbery statute.
Q

Is not the very presence of that definition,

though, perhaps such an indication?
MR. DUNAU;

No, Your Honor, because that definition

was taken from the New York statute and precisely taken from
the New York statute to repel any notion that what Congress
was enacting in the Hobbs Act was anti-labor intentive.

And

when, we looked to New York law to find out how New York
applies that extortion definition, we find that New York says

27
the dividing line between what labor activity is extortionate
and what is not is the felonious misappropriation of
property.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

AFTERNOON SESSION - Is00 QECLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. DUNAU:

Mr. Dtinau.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court z
We have pondered the question that Mr. Justice
Stewart put to us, and we conclude that we cannot embrace the
suggestion that the dividing line is mandatory collective
bargaining rather than the one we have thought is essential,
namely, misappropriation of property.

Mandatory collective

bargaining draws the line between what an employer and a
union must bargain over.

There are permissive subjects of

bargaining which are perfectly legal, and we therefore do not
think that we can exclude and put

within the scope of the

extortion statute permissive subjects of bargaining.

And,

therefore,we think consistently with what this statute is
about, extortion and robbery, that the line we need to draw
is at the misappropriation of property.
Q

One side of the coin I am sure you would be

delighted to embrace, arid that is surely and at least, where
you are talking about a subject that is subject of mandatory
bargaining, then certainly this act cannot apply.
MR. DUNAUt

Yes, Hour Honor.

That is the

innermost position.

We are not willing to accept it as the

outermost position.

And accepting it as the innermost

position, we are well within any such line in this case.

It is the means directed to a

misappropriation of property. Your Honor.

That is our line,

and we do not think that if can foe drawn simply at getting
property from another regardless of your intent to steal it.
We do not think, for example, in this case, which is
necessarily the Government's position, that simply because you
are seeking a collective bargaining agreement and a collective
bargaining agreement is a chosen action, it is property, that

30
therefore you have met the statutory test of obtaining
property from another because you are seeking to get them
in a collective bargaining agreement and then letting the
whole burden of the illegality of the conduct fall on the
wrongful means.

If you do that, then what this statute

reaches is strike violence simpliciter.

And strike violence

simpliciter is neither robbery nor extortion.
Q

You. would agree that this statute is not

aimed—1 think yon said. that, earlier—-it is not aimed at
employer/employee problems primarily, is it?
MR. DUNAUs

It is a broad statute applicable to

everyone»
Q

The language is the term “extortion” means

the obtaining--obtaining—of property from another induced
by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,

violence,

or fear,
MR. DUNAUs

That is exactly the language, Your

Honor, of the New York statute which was deliberately copied
so as to repel a notion that we were doing anything very
revolutionary in enacting the Hobbs Act.

And the New York

cases at the time the Hobbs Act was enacted are perfectly
clear that you cannot have extortion and you cannot have
robbery when you are dealing with labor action unless it is
conjoined with felonious intent to misappropriate property.
So that when the labor action which is taken is designed to

31
collect union dues, for example, or more broadly to advance
the cause of unionism, it is not extortion or robbery within
the New York concept; when it. is taken in order to get money
and put it: in your pocket, a payoff, something dissociated
from a legitimate labor objective, it is extortion and it is
robbery»

If we do not accept the line of misappropriation

of property, what we have here is a statute which deals with
strike violence standing alone, and we do not think in 1945
Congress enacted a statute dealing with strike violence
standing alone.

If it is strike violence standing alone,

there is no line that can be drawn between a fist fight and
murder, between a deflated

tire and arson.

The Government

suggests, "Well, what the line is is your intent to get a
union contract by throwing a rock through a window pane.
Q

Let us suppose for a moment that the setting

is not such as it was here but it was a bus company with
300 buses, each with four tires presumably, maybe six on
some of them.

Suppose they deflated all the tires in the

same setting otherwise as this.

It would be your claim that

deflating 1200 tires so as to immobilize the bus line and
its operations would not be within the reach of the Hobbs
Act?
MR. DUNAU;

That is correct, Your Honor, because

we cannot draw the line, as we see it, between major violence
and minor violence.

We can draw the line sensibly between

32
stealing and not stealing, between misappropriating
property and not misappropriating property»
Q

Mr. Dunau, is language found in 1951(b)(2)

where extortion is defined as the obtaining of property from
another , is that same, definition of extortion found in ha.ee
verba in the New York statute?
MR. DUNAU:
G

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that covered at page 40 of your brief?

I

could not find it in so many words.
MR. DUNAUs

No. I am sorry, we neglected in our

brief to quote precisely what the New York statute was at the
time that the Hobbs Act was enacted.

But. the New York Penal

Law of 1905, which was in effect at the time the Hobbs Act
was enacted, defined extortion as "extortion is the obtaining
of property from another or the obtaining the property of a
corporation from an officer, agent, or employee thereof,
with his consent induced by wrongful use of force or fear or
under color of official right."

So, aside from the deletion

of the words "or the obtaining the property of a corporation
from an officer, agent, or employee thereof," it is
precisely the same.

Extortion is the obtaining of property

from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of
force or fear or under color of official right.
Q

You are not suggesting that when Congress

adopted this, they took all of New York's meanings as we know

33
under some circumstances?
ME. DUNMJ%

ROf sir.

What we are suggesting that

the Congress did is that it adopted the conventional notion
of robbery and extortion as a compound offense which
requires not simply the use of wrongful means but the

use

of those wrongful means directed to the misappropriation of
property.

As the Third Circuit put it, what the Hobbs

reaches is a larceny type offense.

If it reaches a larceny

type offense—and we think that is an exactly apt summariza­
tion r~it is not stealing to get a union contract calling for
higher wages.
The words “with his consent" in extortion or
“against his will55 in robbery, if I may say so, are the
metaphysics which go back to an old notion of how you
distinguish robbery from an extortion.

If you apply a lot of

force, you are said to have overcome the man's will.

If you

apply less than a lot of force but enough to cause him to
part with his property, you say it is parting with his
property with Ms consent.
the words

But no one who has tried to parse

“with his consent” as "against his will" has been

able to make a sensible distinction between the two.

I think

the use of the words "with his consent" are simply
responsive to the fashion in defining extortion, but they do
not give us any particular meaningful analysis.
Q

Does it happen in some cases you find it in

34
that context or the extortion context as meaning "with his
apparent consentn?
MR. DUNAUj

It can never he with his consent,

Your Honor-—
Q

"Apparent»'5 That is why I put the adjective in»

MR. DUNAUs

That would be the only explanation for

the use of the words "with his consent," would be to trans­
late it "with his apparent, consent/* because in every one of
these cases, whether it is robbery or an extortion that you
deal with it, you are getting a man to give up something
which but for the exertion of a wrongful means he would keep
in his own pocket.
I think perhaps 1 can illustrate-—
Q
far?

Let us pursue that.

Does it have to go that

The extortion may never be consummated, is that not

true?
MR» DUNAUs

Then it would be an attempt to extort,

Your Honor.

And the statute reaches an attempt to extort.

Q

Yes, you can have an effort to extort which

is not consummated which nevertheless violates the statutes.
MR. DUNAUi

That is correct, Your Honor.

But whether it. is an

attempt, a conspiracy, or a consummated offense, the
indispensable ingredient of it is not only the wrongful means

but the misappropriation of property*
The Government seeks•# because it is forced by its
argument# to agree that if a jury were to find that throwing
a rock through a window pane was with the intent to get the
employer to sign a union contract that that is extortion»
It does not like that line to which it is put because it

Attorney in the position of being a police court.

So# it

If Congress had ever written a statute which said#
"We will reach strike violence except that which constitutes
incidental injury not infrequently occurring as a consequence

turning it down as a standardless crime# as an unknowable
offense.

Who can say whether violence is incidental or not#

whether the dispute has been prolonged sufficiently so we are
going to excuse the intentional act because of frustration?
This is a standardless crime that the Government would now
impose upon us.

Q

Therefore, you would, completely concede that

MR. DUNAUs

Local 807 must, be decided differently

on the 1945 amendment to the anti-racketeering act.

the Court had the first case interpreting the 1943 amendment,

one can construct plausible arguments to go beyond that# but
at that, point we are inventing with respect to what is a
criminal statute# and of all the things we know by way of
historical emphasis# what we do in a free society we do not

what it wants before we put a man in jail.
The Government had no problem in Local 807 when it
was arguing to this Court in distinguishing between strike
violence as such and extortion.

And it said to this Court in

its brief at page 46# which we quote at page 48 of our
brief# "If the defendants ha.d been seeking to achieve a
legitimate labor objective# we doubt whether their
activities would come within the scope of the act simply
because of the presence of violence." The whole' tenor of the
act indicates that Congress intended to punish activities
similar to extortion.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDSv ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. REYNOLDS?

Just a few comments, Mr. Chief

.

Justice, if I may.
Appellees have argued that an application of the
act turns on whether there is a misappropriation of property.
Extortion traditionally has not required that there be a
misappropriation of property.

I think the most traditional

incident of extortion is where somebody uses force or violence
to

force someone to pay over a debt that is due to them,

money that they are already entitled to.

It is extortion if

they use force or violence to get that debt repaid.
The California Supreme Court in People v. Beggs
under an extortion statute which is identical to the one that
is now in the Hobbs Act and is also identical to the Hew York
statute, said this about this concept of misappropriation of
property.

It says, "It is the means employed with the law

denounces and though the purpose may be to collect a just
indebtedness, it is nevertheless within the statutory

39
inhibition.

Hence, the fact that the end accomplished by

such means is rightful cannot avail one as a defense in such
prosecution any more than such facts will constitute a
defense where one compels payment of a just debt by the
threat to do an unlawful injury to the person of the debtor."
What Congress did here , is they use the word
"obtain/’ not misappropriation.

It is the same definition

they used in the Consumer Protection Act, as the Chief Justice
earlier pointed out,, to define extortion.
Appellees rely on New York law.

The New York

definition is not completely identical to the definition in
the Hobbs Act.

The New York statute went on fee define the

word "fear," and it said that the term "fear" includes where
one is induced by threat to do an unlawful injury to person
or property.

In all the New York cases cited by appellees,

the question was whether or not the threat in those cases
was made with the intent to extort.
felonious intent.

The question of

We agree that the matter of intent is a

necessary element, but on determining whether or not the
indictment should be dismissed, it does not come into play.
It is a question for the jury.

And the New York courts say

exactly that in all the decisions that are cited by the
appellees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
