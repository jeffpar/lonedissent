MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We will hear argumentc

next in Ho, 71-850, United States against Mara,
Mr, Lacovara, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A* LACOVARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LACOVARA:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This case, as I mentioned, is the follow-up, the
sequel to United,States against Dlonlnlo.

It is also here on

writ of certiorari the the Seventh Circuit and in this case
we have a slightly different factual setting.

This was,an

investigation being pursued not by a special grand jury out
by the regular September, 1971 grand jury and the grand jury
was investigating a theft from interstate shipment and a
conspiracy violation.
Mr. Mara was subpoenaed before the grand jury and
was directed by the grand jury foreman

to give exemplars of

his handwriting and his printing and he refused, on
constitutional grounds, essentially fourth and fifth amendment
grounds,
The government then filed a petition with the
district court to comple Mr. Mara to give the handwriting
and printing exemplars and in that petition, the government
alleged the nature of the grand jury investigation which

4
was an Investigation under Section 659, theft of interstate
shipment and 371, conspiracy and it alleged that Hr. Mara
had been asked for handwriting and printing exemplars which
the grand Jury considered essential and necessary solely
for the purpose of comparing his handwriting to determine
whether he was the author of certain writings that were before
the grand jury.

The petition further alleged that Mr*, ‘fera had
refused to obey the foreman's direction and had refused to
give the handwriting and printing exemplas: a.

The government also, in an attempt to comply with
what it understood to be the requirement

of United. States y,

Dlonlslo which we were nevertheless challenging before this
court, submitted in camera to the district court .an affidavit
by an FBI agent who testified before the grand Jury and in
that affidavit, as the petition alleged, the court would
determine that there were reasonable grounds, if reasonableness
must be determined for the grand Jury's demand for the hand»
writing exemplars.
That affidavit was before the district court at the
hearing on the government petition.

The respondent objected

to the petition for the exemplar' order, raising -Issenttally
two grounds.
First, the contention **as that the government did
not have probable

cause to support the application, the

5
argument being that since the grand jury had not indicted him*
it clearly did not yet have probable cause to think that he
was somehow linked with the crime and9 secondly, the
objection was- made that the government was trying to support
the petition by a showing of reasonableness by submitting an
affidavit that was not being made available.
The district judge ruled that an hv camera submission
was sufficient and it also ruled that probable cause was not
the standard necessary, even under Dionisio to secure an
exemplar order.
The respondent, Mr. Mara, was then ordered to
provide such samples of his handwriting arid his printing as
the grand jury might deem necessary and in this case,
Mr. Justice Marshall, the order explicitly did not make any
reference, 1 believe, to the — to any agents

of the grand

jury, it said, to provide the exemplars before and to the
grand jury.
There has been no objection —~ there was no
objection at the hearing, either before the grand jury or
at the original hearing 021 that ground.

After the district

court entered its order requiring the giving of the
exemplars.and Mr. Mara refused in open court to give the
exemplars and was committed for contempt, Mr. Mara, through
his counsel, submitted an application for a stay or for bond
and in that application, as he has since than, has urged the

6
contention that it was improper to suggest or to direct that
the handwriting exemplars be given to a sworn agent of the
grand jury,

The argument is made that this goes beyond the

lawful province of the grand jury to anticipate.

I say that

the government's position on this is the same as it was on
the prior case# that the refusal before the grand jury was
a categorical one# based on constitutional grounds# not
based on the locale.of the giving of the exemplars and both
the petition and the order call only for the giving of exem­
plars before the gran jury# if respondent is willing to comply
with that.
After the

district court denied bail or stay» the

court of appeals aid release Mr* Mara on bond and when the
case was argued# the court of

appeals also asked that the

FBI agent’s affidavit be submitted to it In camera and that
was subsequently done.

The affidavit is now before this

court as a sealed exhibit.

It has never been seen# to the

best of ray knowledge9 by respondent.
The Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its holding in
Dionisip that the fourth amendment requires that the govern­
ment on behalf of a grand jury must make affirmative showing
of reasonableness before it can obtain an exemplar like this
from a witness.
The court rejected fifth and sixth amendment
privilege and counsel claims for-

essentially the same

7
reasons that i t had In Dlonlsio hut it held here that it would
address

i\j seix

to the procedures that the government had

to

avail itself of in order to show reasonableness and would
also discuss the s ub stant iva content of that reasonableness
showing.
On both points, the Seventh Circuit hold that the
government9 on behalf of the grand jury, had beer, deficient.
On the

question of the proper procedure the

Seventh Circuit ruled that in order to demonstrate reasonable*
ness the government must submit Its affidavit or any other
proof it wants to bring to the attention of the district
court in an open and adversary hearing so the court or
appeals said., the respondent can have an opportunity to
litigate the sufficiency of the government showing,
The court ruled that grand Jury secrecy Is not a
magical incantation and was not applicable in this kind of
setting.
On the question of the substantive showing, the
content of the reasonableness•determination, the couro
Imposed a number of factual requireents that must be
affirmatively demonstrated by the government,

‘These are set

forth, of course, in the court’s opinion which is printed
as an appendix to the cert petition.
The court of appeals stated at the outset that the
government must show that what is being conducted is a lawful

8
properly authorized grand jury investigation, that the
investigation is probing some objective that Congress can
permissively authorize.

It must also show that

.sought .1s relevant to the inquiry.

That is exactly the kind

of preliminary showing that this court in B2:eui?;bu:u-£3 not to
mention many other casas that are cited in the various briefs,
has refused to require a grand jury to show before it can
conduct its inquiry.
In addition to what it termed a showing of
relevance to the inquiry, the Seventh Circuit Insisted that
the government must show that the grand jury process is not
being abused and that the exemplars being sought are adequate
but not excessive to its purpose.
Now, that rather ambiguous formulation was
amplified by the Seventh Circuit which went on to say that
this meant that the government had to show exactly, with
more specific detail than the FBI agent’s affidavit before it
had shown what the purpose of the identification evidence
was, what its connection was with the crime being investigated,
what the witnesses connection is between the identification
evidence and the crime might be.
The government also has to show, according to the
Seventh Circuit, in order to obtain the exemplar, that the
evidence, the Identification evidence is not-otherwise
available, again, another test that the court.explicitly

9
rejected, in Branzburg in a first amendment context.

And the

court said that it would regard the grand jury process as
being abused if the government failed to show that it was
unable to obtain this material in any other way because the
court said having a grand jury obtain evidence that investi­
gators might otherwise be able to come upon is

an abuse of

process.
We think that is also an unsupportable position.
But in any event 9 the court found that the
showing that the government had made in the affidavit
submitted in camera did not rise to the level of showing
these stringent standards, meeting these stringent standards
of relevancy, non-abuse of grand jury process and direct
link between the witness whose identification evidence was
being sought and the other material before the grand Jury.
The government promptly filed a petition to review
that decision and in the interim, Judge Friendly had a
virtually identical case before him in the Second Circuit,
the case of the United States against Doe (Mr. Schwartz who
was the real party in interest) and in that,.,decision
Judge Friendly, taking specific note of both Dionisio and
Maras ruled that reasonableness was not a standard that had
to be met as an affirmative matter in obtaining this kind of
exemplar, handwriting exemplar and that in any event, If
there is to be some sort of preliminary showing of

10
reasonableness, the test certainly can * t be as burdensome
and as intense as the Seventh Circuit has suggested.
The bedrock position that we take in this case, of
course, is identical to the one in Dlonislo and that is that
the grand jury witnesses lawfully before the grand jury, apart
from a fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination,
the witness has the obligation that every other citizen has
to appear and to give testimony to cooperate in the grand
jury’s investigation even if that means giving some physical,
some noncommunicative or nontestimonial evidence that may be
the
involved in / grand jury’s investigation of him. We think it
is settled that the fifth amendment does not apply to this
kind of inquiry as even the Seventh Circuit has.held.
Vie also believe that, like a voice .exemplar., hand­
writing Is a kind of identifying physical .characteristic that
one does not have a reasonable expectation about.

His hand­

writing is customarily made available in all’ sorts of casual
contacts and that the grand jury is not usurping any untoward
power.

It is not impinging upon any privacy when It asks the

witness to provide it with a sample of his handwriting.
Now, there is some argument in this case, as in
the other, that giving of exemplar evidence is somehow
different for fourth amendment purposes from the giving of
oral testimony which all concede is not covered by the
fourth amendment because giving of exemplar evidence involves

Ii
an act of the will.

It involves an affirmativa physical act

to creates in the words of the legal aid agencies , to create
the evidence that is being sought.
Wells in a senses there is a creative process that
who
is at work here.
The wltness/is being asked for a voice
exemplar or for a handwriting exemplar must-, as a matter of
intellect and will, decide that he will cooperate.

He must

order his muscles, his diaphragm, his larynx or his hands in
this case, to manifest the evidence but we cannot see that
there is any constitutional difference between that kind of
voluntary action, that kind of cooperation', “ancPthe kind of
voluntary action or cooperation that an ordinary grand jury
who
witnsss/is being asked for oral testimony must furnish.
He, too, when asked what do you know about the
accident that occurred on 33rd street, or when.asked what do
you know about gambling in Cairo, Illinois. must go through the
same cognitive process of deciding whether he will volun­
tarily formulate a response, whether he will order his body
to provide the evidence that that will be intelligible to the
grand Jury itself.

He has to create the evidence that is to

be laid before the grand jury.
We think that for fourth amendment purposes no less
than for fifth amendment purposes there is no relevant
constitutional distinction between the giving of oral
testimony that is unprovileged and the giving of physical

12
exemplar evidence that is not Itself subject to an expectation
of privacy and that, we submit, is this case.
Now, moving along to the standards, and as
Mr, Justice Stewart asked in the early case, if the court
agrees with the second circuit and disagrees with the
Seventh in the Dionisio decision and holds that there is no
burden on the grand jury to show reasonableness before it can
expect compliance with its orders, then the' two issues that
are before the court in this case become academic.
That is, the procedure to be followed showing
reasonableness and the content of the reasonableness shown
but, assuming the court decides that there is some obligation
of this sort9 we submit that in this kind of context a
current, ongoing grand jury investigation, the procedure that
was followed in this case is quite sufficient.

That Is, the

submission of an in camera affidavit which the district judge
can examine to determine whether it is sufficient.
We think that cases relied on by the Seventh
Circuit are quite at odds with the customary obligations of
adversary litigation and we also emphasise that we are
talking here about a grand Jury proceeding where there is a
need for-, dispatch,.-there Is a need for secrecy., there is a
need for simplifying the proceedings, especially when, as we
believe is the case, there are no major constitutional
valueb impXicated.

13

Now 8 the submission of an ex-party affidavit for the
court to make some legal test of its sufficiency* is not at
all unusual in this kind, of setting.

It is the traditional

procedure with a search warrant and it has beers, thought
necessary that the warrant can actually fee issueds this is
what actually happens.

The warrant is issued,

‘Whatever

privacy is involved is already invaded pursuant to that
warrant before there is any opportunity to test its
sufficiency in an adversary proceeding.
But going beyond that, the

cases relied on like

Davis against the United States s the grand jury minutes case
or Alderman, the illegal electronics surveillance case, talked
about the necessity for an adversary hearing because the
inquiry in that area was one of relevance and the relevance
determination is one that turns on a lot of subtle factors
which cannot always be recognised by a judge who is not as
close to the evidence, to the investigation, to the background
as the adverse party.

But even in Alderman, the court said

that there are related kinds of inquiries that can be made
and made decisively and finally, ex; party by.the judge and in
fact in subsequent cases also reported in the same volume
of the U.S. Reports, Giordano and Tagliane.tti, the court
explicitly affirmed that district judges acting in camera
without an adversary hearing could decide such issues as
whether a person had standing to complain about fourth

:u
amendment violation and could even decide ex-party without
any contest from an adverse litigant that, in particular,
electronics surveillance was legal and that determination
would not be subject to any adversarial litigation.
We consider this kind of case

a fortiori because

if a district judge can make a decisive and conclusive
determination that an electronics surveillance

is lawful

and can make that without giving any opportunity to the other
side to contest that determination, we think in a much more
extreme posture of an ongoing grand jury investigation there
is even less justification for demanding that the government's
showing of reasonableness, if any, it must make must be
subjected to full litigation and in this case I might point
out that what we have is an order by the court of appeals
that the respondent in an exemplar case must be given an
opportunity to test the sufficiency of the government showing,
and I think that clearly contemplates a full trial-type or
hearing-type proceeding.
Q

That, 1 think, is —

Perhaps your summary of adversary hearings

in the electronics surveillance case is a statement of a
wish fulfillment of

some kind because you go way beyond

anything we have ever held.
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, 4in' the Tagilanettl case which

was in 39^ U.S., the court summarily affirmed, granted cert and.
affirmed the judgment holding that the district judge had

15
acted properly in determining who had been, overheard and who
had not, even thought the defendant wanted to -—
Q

That is true, but the discussion in Alderman

of the relevancy in the need for an adversary hearing was
very explicit.
MR. LACOVARA:
holding.

Yes, sir.

We are not contesting that

What we are saying is that the kind of inquiry here

is quite different from the relevancy determination in
Alderman where we can see that it is difficult for a judge
who is not familiar with the activities of the individuals —*
Q

Well, he doesn’t know the case, he doesn’t

know the prosecution, he doesn’t know the defense.
MR. LACOVARA:
Q

Pardon me?

I am sorry.

A judge does not always know the whole pattern

of the prosecution’s ease or the defense’s case.
MR. LACOVARA:

That is'the underlying rationale for

Alderman and, indeed, for Dormis.

It is difficult to make a

relevancy determination.
Q

Yes.

MR. LACOVARA:

Ex-party.

We concede that.

Here

we are talking about not making a relevancy determination
but determining whether the grand jury has a reasonable
basis for asking a witness to provide an, exemplar.

We think

that is the kind of determination that can be made ex-party
on the basis of the submission by the government.

This is the

.16

kind of determination that a judge who is presented with an.
application for a search warrant customarily makes and he
even has to make a higher standard of determination than in
this cs.se because the Seventh Circuit has not said that
probable cause is the standard but we are content in our
system to allow district Judges to make ex-party determinations
of probable cause and I think even though you are correct
that the court hasn5t completely ruled on all of these
electronic surveillance issues, in Taglianettl,5 as 1 say»
the court did affirm the ex-party procedure that was followed
in determining who had been overheard and who had not and in
Giordano, which was a master order of sending back for
further proceedings a number of electronics surveillance
cases, Mr. Justice .Stewart explicitly stated
concurring opinion that the court was in no way Intimating
that ex-party proceedings were not satisfactory to determine
legality and that, in fact, has been the process that has
been followed in lower courts.
So we think, then, that' the rationale for the
adversary hearing cases is inapplicable.
On the other side we have what is a legitimate
value and that is the value of grand jury secrecy,

We are

not talking now about attempts to keep the minutes of grand
jury proceedings secret so that they can11 be used to impeach
a witness when he testifies years afterwards.

We are talking

17

about a requirement that the Seventh Circuit has imposed
that the government make an open showing of the current status

of a grand jury proceeding.

We think that is probably as

distant from the legitimate purposes of grand jury secrecy
which were designed to provide the grand Jury an. opportunity
to pursue its investigation without providing any tip-off,
either to the witnesses or to other people who may not be
called

before the grand jury about the focus of the grand

jury's investigation, its progress thus far, which witnesses
may so far have been called before it or which Witnesses may
not have been.

Vie think that balancing those two factors the

lack of any substantial need for an adversary litigation of
a showing of reasonableness against the very considerable
interest of preserving the secrecy of an ongoing grand jury
combined to render the Seventh Circuit’s decision wrong.
The separate inquiry, of course, is the one of the
standard of reasonableness of the Seventh Circuit in
explaining what it meant in Dlonlslo by listing all of the
criteria that must be met here, I think has gone far beyond
what this court has ever intimated must be shown, certainly
in any grand jury investigation.
The court imposes a very stringent obligation of
showing relevancy which is perhaps even more intense than the
similar suggestion that had been made and rejected in
Bransburg and 1 think it is our position, for much less

18
justifiable constitutional objective.
Further-mores the requirement that the government,
the grand jury must show that the evidence is not otherwise
available, another criterion that was rejected in Branzburg
as unwarranted, is somewhat unrealistic because at the one
ends if the witness himself is agreeable to providing a
handwriting exemplar, we don’t have the litigation that we
are confronted with today where the witness refuses on
constitutional grounds to cooperate.
On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that
using other Investigative channels to secure handwriting
exemplars may be even more intrusive on fourth amendment
interests than is issuing court process asking a person to
come to the United States court house where in secrecy he
can provide an exemplar.

It would be possible, presumably,

for FBI agents to go to a person*a-bank or to a credit
agency or to his employer and ask whehter they will supply
exemplars

of the would-be witnesses handwriting,
I don't think that the court should regard the

lack of use of those alternatives as something the government
must affirmatively apologize for before it asks a grand, jury
witness to provide exemplars.
The level of the showing that the Seventh Circuit
has imposed in this decision I think can best be illustrated
by a reading of the government’s petition before the district

19
court which set out specifically the offense that was being
investigated by the grand jury which set out specifically
that the grand jury thought it necessary for this witness
to provide handwriting and printing exemplars so that the
grand jury could determine whether he was the author of
particular writings already before the grand jury.
In that context, I think if that showing does not
meet whatever reasonableness showing the constitution may
call for — of course, we argue that it calls fox’ none —
the standard must be something quite close to probable cause
which is an anamalous requirement since probable'cause is
the end of the grand jury’s inquiry, not the beginning.
For that reason, we request that the judgment of
the Seventh Circuit be reversed.
MR. CHEIF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Lacovara.

Mr. Ruggiero.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELO RUGGIERO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUGGIERO;
may .it please the Court;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and
'••••-.

I would like to start ray argument

for® this

court to get to certain aspects of the facts as they evolved
in this Mara case.

The government has just conceded the

point that this was not a special grand jury that Mara was
called before.

It was just an ordinary grand jury.

He

20

appeared in the U.S. Attorney’s office in Chicago on two
separate occasions.

He was asked for his handwriting

exemplars not by the grand jury or the foreman of the grand
jury but by the U.S. Attorney.
the grand

jury.

He was asked to return to

He was asked again by the U.S. Attorney,

the assistant in the grand jury room to supply these hand­
writing exemplars and upon his refusal to do so on
constitutional grounds, the U.S. Attorney directed the foreman
of the grand jury to direct the witness to supply the hand­
writing exemplars and that is how there came about the
petition then before the district court Judge ;Robson in our
district and the order, the petition which is set forth in
the appendix asked for the giving of these-'handwriting
exemplars.

.
To this day we do not know what is in that affidavit

which was submitted in camera to Judge Robson, the first that
the witness or his counsel-knew of what -— some semblance of
what was in that affidavit is what was set forth in the
t

cult court of api

•

• •

. wherein they stated

contents of the affidavit were solely the

work product

of

an PB1 agent, the sole product of an FBI agent and that it was
investigation which occurred outside the scope of a grand
jury.
Mara was not afforded an opportunity

of counsel,

no kind of procedure was afforded him outside the grand jury

21
>rein and whereby he would give exemplars to an FBI
agent,

We: do not know whether or not the ?BI agent w4& tbs

duly designated authorized agent of a grand. Jury and In that
posture, that is how' that case came before the U.S. Court
of Appeals and it is now presently before this court.

We do not* that is Mara, wo do not aoaoodo that
the exemplars sought by the government are

non -*t-er,t:1•aonial

or non-communicative because we just do not know.

We have no idea, as 1 have stated,, -.at td what is
in these affidavits.

It well might be that what this grand

jury or precisely what the

government wanted was matter

which was essentially germane to the government * s case

,o

prove a case against Mara because as they stated in their
petition or order, he was a potential defendant in an
investigation with reference to the statutes involved,
Q

Mr, Ruggiero, I air. not clear.

Are you

suggesting that perhaps the government is after something by
way of communication of ideas and facts as distinguished from
just a sample, a nutral sample of handwriting?
MR. RUGGIERO:
Mr. Chief Justice.

I don*t know,

X just don't know.

I don * t know,
I operate here as X

stand before this dourt in -a"Vacuum. . This is an affidavit and
1

repeat it for the third time and that has been,the issue
7

before the district court.

/
i

Q

What if the grand jury furnished him with a

22
i list of .

totally uneon *' cfced, no message

at all, just a list of ^0 words or 20 words' and 20 names and
asked him to write that down.

Wort* your position be the same

as it is now?
MR. RUGGIERO:

My ; os.tion would be that if what he

is asked to write down is gemane or essential to the
government*s case to prove it:.case, then 1 — my position
would be the same, yes.
Q

So that then it :oes not go to the communication

issue alone that you first suggested?
If it will help make a case against him, you say,
it is prohibited?
MR. RUGGIERO:

Yes, I do, your Honor.

is a two-pronged argument there.

Firstly, it

Firstly, we don’t know if

if it — first of all we don’t know if it is testimonial or
communicative and secondly, even if it were, it would apply
if it is selectively germane to the government’s case whereas
they need that to make their case.
Q

If it is testimony, the fifth amendment is

available.
MR. RUGGIERO:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

This is what we are talking about,
This ie exactly what I am talking

about, the fifth amendment.
Q

But that is something you would have no way

of knowing until you know what the — until h@ actually goes

23
before the grand jury and gives whatever form of exemplar
they want.
MR. RUGGIERO:

That Is correct.

We did not get

that far.

We were asked to give — he was asked to give an

exemplar.

In my recollection we were never told what it was

and on that basis unpon refusal on the grounds, as I
mentioned in our briefs, the fourth and fifth, we even raised
the sixth amendment then the abuse of a grand jury as we did
here.

On that basis, the government went before the lower

district court and in answer to the government’s-argument
before Judge Robson, we never got an opportunity to argue
*

other than the fourth amendment problem.

That is, that

affidavit because Judge Robson — and it is -in the'appendix
in the colloquy between Judge Robson and myself— stated
that it was his opinion that the constitutional' grounds
raised and because of that affidavit that he -had to gives
that is, Mara had to give the exemplars.
that point,

¥e"never got beyond

it is about a 10-page paragraph in the appendix.

So we never got into the other issues as to the fifth, the
sixth and the abuses of the grand jury.

It was his opinion

and. that was it.
We do not, as I stated, concede that these are
non-testimonial and non-communicative exemplars because we
do not know.

We also

do not concede that Gilbert, I don't

believe that Gilbert or Wade state that handwriting exemplars

24
do not fall within the purview of the fifth amendment because
Gilbert did not raise the content of the exemplar.

Gilbert

only said that exemplars — handwriting exemplars are not
within the

purview of the fifth amendment.
We do raise that question here before this court.

We raise the content.

We raise the testimonial and

communicative nature of the exemplars before this court
because if it is selectively germane to proving a government
case3 then the fifth amendment would apply and this, of
course, would dovetail into the fourth amendment as it
applies here because of the affidavit which was submitted
in camera.
Q

If the point you are trying"tcfreserve is

not that anything which contributes to the government’s case,
even a set of 20neutral words, as posited by the Chief
Justice

but which you might be asked for before the grand

jury is, you know, where were you on the night of'January 20th?
Isn’t the way to preserve that to go before the grand jury
and let them ask that question and then raise your fifthamendment point?
MR. RUGGIERO:

I would agree, your Honor.

true and that is what he should do.

That is

But he was asked for

exemplars and as I stated, I don’t know what he was asked to
give.

He wa,3 asked to give certain exemplars.

He refused

to do so based upon, as I stated, his constitutional rights.

25

Q

That would be the time to refuse on
But if they gave him the list of

neutral names and neutral words, you say you would still not

MR. RUGGIERO:

If it is something which, again, is

selectively germane, it is essential to the government*s
proof in a case, then I say that the fifth amendment would
apply because —
Q

How can you know that until the case is tried?

MR. RUGGIERO:
Q

Well, I don't know.

We don't know.

Well, then, in effect you are saying

you don’t

have to give any handwriting for any purpose under any
circumstances.

That is the case you are putting to this

court now.
MR. RUGGIERO:

That is the case that is before this

court.
Q

So then all the discussion about communication

is really Irrelevant to the issue, isn't it?
MR. RUGGIERO:

It Is not irrelevant, Mr. Chief

Justice, if, in the posture as it is put forth, if he is
asked certain questions about, for instance, this case,

26

whether or not It is a hijack case or a conspiracy case and
certain questions along that line

and the posture in the
i

case in the questions that may be asked may show that what
they are asking for is that selectively germane thing that
they want, the essential to prove their case,
Q

Well, when you — I am not sure I understand

just what you mean —
MR. RUGGIERO:
Q

Sure,

~ Mr. Ruggiero, about "selectively germane,"

Would you consider a list of 20 names, surnames of people and
a list of 20 words "selectively germane?"
I4R.. RUGGIERO:

If — if they are used to prove

a

forgery or perhaps in this case to prove a receipt — the
signing of a receipt.
Q

Well, he signed gambling slips,

That is what

this whole thing is about, isnft It?
MR. RUGGIERO:

No, it is not.

Not this'.'particular

case.
Q

This one?

MR. RUGGIERO:

No, no, not this case, your Honor,

This case has to do with, as I — interstate shipping,
commonly known as hijacking.
Q

Well, then, signing invoices

MR. RUGGIERO:
Q

and —

That7s — that ~

Signing of invoices and related documents.

27
MR. RUGGIERO:

That is the issue.

If they need

his signature or whatever it is that they are seeking to
state that he is the individual that signed this invoice or
this check or this receipt, then I think that is what I would
call ’’selectively germane” to prove their case.
I don't think there is any doubt that if they
came to Mara and asked him, ’’Did you sign this receipt?” that
he could assert his privilege of the fifth amendment.

I

don’t think there is any question about that.
Q

What about if they went to the bank and

subpoenaed all his records and used the handwriting there?
MR. RUGGIERO:

That is another question which is

something* incidentally, that the court of appeals suggested
that they do do is to go and get their investigation which
seems to be what they did in their affidavit.
Q

But you say they could do that?

MR. RUGGIERO:

They could do that.

I would say

that they could do that.
Q

Notwithstanding the fact that a man's bank

records are something in the nature of personal effects,
are they not?
MR. RUGGIERO:

But there is a question, Mr. Chief

Justice, between asking a man to come in a grand Jury room
or the U.S. Attorney and asking him to write his name and
going to a bank and getting his signature from a bank.

28
Q

Even if they take

the government to the same

place in the long run, you think that difference is
important?
MR. RUGGIERO:

Yes, it is.

To me, it is and it all,

as I said, cornes down to the fourth amendment questions in my
argument as to probable cause because of the affidavit and the
government seems to take the tack that there should be, at
the least, as to a showing, as to a hearing, ex-party as
there would be in search warrant.

But I know of no case

or an arrest warrant — I know of no case that has been cited
to me or that I have read or anybody has called to my
attention where an individual in a search or an arrest
warrant cannot see that affidavit in an effort to suppress it
or to quash it.

I know of no case.

In this particular

instance we have never been allowed to see that affidavit.
We just — we are here in limbo.
involved.

We don’t know what is

If that is the government’s position, I should

think that we would be entitled to look at that affidavit to
see if there is anything in it which would be akin to
probable cause.
Q

What if, instead of an affidavit, a witness

had appeared before the grand jury, just in advance of calling
your client and the same information was submitted to the
grand jury, not in writing but by oral testimony?

Would you

think you were entitled to have a transcript of that oral

29

testimony before you went ahead?
MR. RUGGIERO:
Q

No.

No, your Honor.

What is the difference?

MR. RUGGIERO:

The difference is' that the witnesses

have appeared before that court, excuse me, before the grand
Jury.

They haven't here.

No such thing occurred here.

Nobody appeared before the —
Q

Then why do you — will you suggest why that

becomes crucial?

It is a difference, obviously, but, now,

why is the difference crucial.?
MR. RUGGIERO:

The difference is because it is

based upon a affidavit submitted by an FBI agent add we have
rules of procedure in cases from this court which set forth
the procedure within the limits of the fourth amendment that
says that it either searches and seizures — no unreasonable
searches and seizures and no probable cause.

There has to

- , ......

be probable cause, no search warrants without probable cause.
That is the difference.
Q

But isn’t it true, Mr. Ruggiero, at least in

connection with a search warrant or an arrest warrant that
your normal motion to quash comes up after the search has
been made or after the arrest has been made?

And whereas at

that time you may have a right to examine the affidavit, you
don’t have any right to insist that the magistrate give you
a hearing before you are to be arrested or before you are to

30
be served.
MR. RUGGIERO:

That Is true.

That is true.

The question as to the unreasonableness I will
leave to my colleague on my left, as to the unreasonable
in the fourth amendment questions.
The issue of the grand jury here and the abuse of
the grand jury is one that I think that in the times today
calls for an important expression by this court.

You have

here — you have had in this situation, in the Mar-a situations
a United States Attorney who was directing what this grand
jury was to do.

All of the questions directed to the —• Mara,

all of the information sought from him was asked for him not
by the grnad jury but by a U.S. Attorney and what, in effect,
has occurred in the Mara case exactly is that the grand jury
has become an arm, investigative arm of the U.S. Government
and I think that, in view of the cases that have come down
and I take to heart the statement in the speech given by
our Chief Judge Campbell ~ who was then Chief Judge.

He

Judicial Center.

their operations and what occurred and it was his opinion
in that speech that grand juries should be abolished because
any U.S. .Attorney who deems it necessary can Indict anybody

31
for any reason whatsoever and that the grand jury does not
function today as an arm to stand between the accused and
the accuser and on that basis it should be abolished and I
concur in that expression, especially in view of what has
occurred in this case.
If this grand Jury had been investigating solely on
its own basis, had been directing questions and asking
questions, was seeking information on its own, that would be
one question.

But it was not.

-This grand Jury was acting

under the authority of the Assistant U.S. Attorney in that
courtroom and he was directing the operations in that court­
room.

I think that it is time that we have some; expression

from this court as to what the function, again, qf a grand
Jury should be relative to this kind of situation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS-, FHYLIS SKLOOT BAMBERGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
It seems that there are totfo problems for consideration

32
by the Court.

The first is whether nontestimonial

characteristics are protected by the fourth amendment and
the second is, assuming that they are, whether there are some
fourth amendment limitations on the grand jury in their
attempt to get such characteristics.
We believe that some characteristics are protected
and that handwriting exemplars is one of the ones that is
protected.

The particular exemplar

sought by any agency is

not in plain view and that is the reason why
agency or the grand jury must seek it.

the particular

Furthermore, the

authorship of the exemplar which is already :Lh the possession
of either the investigating agency or the grand jury is
unknown so that that factor is very private, just as is the
fact of making the particular exemplar which is requested.
Q

Would you take the same position with respect

to fingerprints, Mrs. Bamberger?
MRS. BAMBERGER:

I would take the same position

with respect to fingerprints.

I think that there is some

distinction which was raised by the court before with respect
to voice.

The person coming before the grand jury generally

responds with his voice and if the government can use that
as a particular way of securing an exemplar, that is
distinguished from the handwriting exemplar which is
generally not used as a means of communication unless the
defendant wishes to do it or unless the witness wishes to

33
do It that way.

Also the question of the scar/ in a .generally

undisclosed place.

I think that Is protected.

On the other

hands facial features or a scar on the face would not be
protected.

1 think we have to look at the normal context of

things, what is generally in open view and what is generally
not in open view to be produced or created or performed by
the individual in the context of the situation.
I think if we look at Schmerber and Davis we can
come to the conclusion that handwriting exemplars are indeed
protected by the fourth amendment.

In Schmerber the question

was whether the government has to get a warrant to get a
blood sample after a person was properly arrested, based on
probable cause and the holding there was that they did not
have to get the warrant because there were exigent circum­
stances and there was probable cause for the arrest.
So we corae to the particular circumstance that blood
is protected.
If

look at

Davis, this court is quite correct

in stating that the holding in Davis does not say that finger­
printing is protected by the fourth amendment.

They did not

have to say it there because it was obtained in otherwise
unconstitutional circumstances.

But I think the inference

from Davis is that indeed it is the fingerprint itself and
not the context in which it was taken which controls because
otherwise the court would not have had to have gone to such

34
great lengths to explain that fingerprints are reliable
because they are unique because they could be obtained In a
one-shot affair because It is not necessary to repeat because
it is a simple procedure.
If we were talking about the means or the context
In which the exemplar was taken, or the fingerprints were
taken, that would be one thing, but the court went on. to
Davis to explain why a lower standard for obtaining finger­
prints would be permissible.

Looking at the characteristics

of the fingerprints and not at the

characteristics of the

proceeding in which it was obtained,

proposed Rule 4l one

I think shares cr draws from Davis this implication because
under 41-one-H-six a person who is requested to give nontestimonial 'identification can come to the magistrate who_
Issues the order and say, "Can this be taken at my home?"
And, assuming that it can be taken in his home or not in a
government agency or not in a courtroom, there is nothing
inherently coercive.

We are not talking about a custodial
' ih

situation such as the police station.
I think that is where the Second Circuit's opinion
in Schwarts is in error by combining the characteristic
exemplar with the atmosphere in which it was taken.
If we look to the question of whether the fourth
amendment should apply to the grand jury, the government
keeps arguing — as it has before — that the grand jury's

35
powers are unlimited.
to Blair.

They refer to Bransburg.

They refer

But in every one of these cases the question which

was raised was one of testimony which has been traditionally
protected by the fifth amendment.

Never, except in these

recent series of cases, including another Second Circuit
decision, U.S. against Doe Devlin, has the scope of the grand
-jury gone beyond testimonial items anci I include within that
context books and records and documents.
This is a new expansion,

t appears* from the

history of the grandjury process into areas not before
covered by the grand jury process.
Now, 1 think that that distinguishes cases like
'•*' Branzburg and Blair which deal with the traditional grand
jury power to secure testimony subject to the fifth amendment
protection and-I think that the government, in explaining,
the scope of the grand jury power, forgets that even the power
to get testimonial evidence is limited by the fifth amendment.
So it seems that where the grand jury power is to go beyond
its traditional scope of requesting testimonial evidence,
including books and records, which is protected by the fifth
amendment, to something non-testimonial, that the non­
testimonial aspects should also be protected and the grand
jury’s power limited by an appropriate constitutional
protection in that way.
Historically, I think the balance fits properly.

36
Historically, as I said* the fifth amendment protected,
against Invasions of testimonial evidence.

There was no

need to apply the fourth amendment because the grand jury did
not seek such evidence.

With Wade and Gilbert this other

evidence is now considered to be non-testimonial.
If the grand jury wishes to secure that evidence
by net affording some protection against the request for it,
the power of the grand jury is greatly broadened beyond what
it has traditionally been.

And I might add that the opinion

in U.S. against Doe Schwartz refers to the fact that Rule 41Second
one refers to a preceding U.S./Circuit opinion, U.S. against
Doe Devlin.

But in Doe Devlin the fourth amendment issue

was never raised.

It was argued entirely on the fifth

amendment and the issue in

Doe Devlin was whether a person

could be punished for contempt for refusing to give the
requested exemplar when, if they had refused to give that
same exemplar to a police officer coming for it, they could
not be held in contempt and of course that is one of the
problems we have which is posed here.
(IfThe individual refuses to give a policeman or an
FBI agent or some other government agent an exemplar where
they do not come with a court order, they cannot be punished
for it,

On the other hand, if they refuse to give that

same exemplar to a grand jury that requests it., under the
position taken by the government, they can be held in

37
contempt,
I think that the standard for determining if the
fourth amendment applies, as we assert It does, the standard
for determining when the government can secure this evidence,
has been outlined in such cases as Camera and Terry , where
the court Is willing to say, "Let us balance, what are the
needs on one side, what are the constitutional protections
on the other side?"

And I think that if we look at it in

that context .we can come out with a test that satisfies
both requirements.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MRS. BAMBERGER:

Thank you* your Honor.

The government claims that the interruption of the

proceeding.

The context here is one of a contempt

That has always been the exception under cases

like Cobbled!ok and DiBella and Costello for a challenge to
the grand jury process and traditionally an attack on the
grand jury process in terms of a refusal to obey means that
the case goes to a court for purposes of a contempt proceeding
and it is in that context that it is appropriate that the
witness in this context where he claims a fourth amendment
privilege be permitted to challenge the subpoena of requiring
production of the exemplar.
It is the court and not the grand, jury that would
make the determination as to whether the Constitution is a
protection.
sense.

There is no fact question involved in the ultimate

It is a constitutional question which must be resolved

by the court.
If we look at the warrant situation as an analogy
to this one , it is true that in a warrant it is obtained in
an ex-party proceeding.

However, usually, in a warrant

context there is a need for speed to prevent the destruction

39
of evidence or to make sure that the defendant does not
flee and then there Is a suppression hearing if the defendant9
the potential defendants is indicted and If the search was
unreasonable in the sense, for instance, if the warrant is
refused and the defendant's house or office is torn apart
there may be a civil damages action.
Here, in this context, as I said, there is no need
for speed.

The defendant Is around, or the witness is around.

He is unlikely to destroy his hand so that he will not give
an exemplar or to cut off his hair so that he need not give
a hair saiTiple.

In any case, the hair can grow back.

And so

we have a real difference in need in this situation and, just
briefly, to summarise, there is an intrusion here.
The intrusion is not an invasion into the body as it
Is In the context of blood, but it is a compulsion by an
order, to produce something and under this

court’s decision

in Morton Salt we look at the way in which the item can be
obtained to determine If there is an intrusion and here
compulsion Is equal to intrusion.
Q

Do you have any other solution in this case,

by way of procedure?
MR. BAMBERGER:

of — well —

Do you have a test?

MRS. BAMBERGER:
is correct.

By way

I think the Seventh Circuit test

40

Q

Is that the one you support?

MRS. BAMBERGER:

Well, we would add one more thing

to that and that is —
Q

What about the relevancy factor-?

MRS. BAMBERGER:

Yes, I think that there should be

a determination of relevancy based on a kind of reasonableness
standard, not probable cause to believe that this exemplar
is the same thing, not probable cause to believe that this
witness will become a defendant but a standard of reasonable»
ness, an explanation of how this particular piece of
evidence, the exemplar, is relevant to the investigation and
I don’t think that that 'would reveal too much in terms of —
Q

Well, would it be relevance in the same sense,

for example, in discovery proceedings that the questions
may be made relevant?
MRS. BAMBERGER:
Q

Yes.

MRS. BAMBERGER:
Q

You mean in civil matters?

A —

You have a rather broad test of relevancy when

you are in discovery.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Yes, I understand that, your Honor

and I think that perhaps in this case if we look at it, that
it has to be — that it should be a statement merely, or a
factual statement that fch© --let me say this, it may not be
as broad, but there must be some basis for concluding that the

testimony requested is relevant to the

.'tL.

on at that time.
Q

Relevant in the sense of aid the investigation

to its objectives?
MRS. BAMBERGER:

That it will aid. the investigation,

yes.
Thank you, your Honors.
Q

How do you know that In a grand jury proceeding

until you have finished?
MRS. BAMBERGER:
Q

Well, you do that, your Honor, in —

Isn't it quite different from the trial of a

case, the relevancy factor?
MRS, BAMBERGER:

Yes, it is, your Honor, but this is

a — this would be a proceeding which would occur in a court
in a contempt proceedings.

In other words, we are not

urging an independent proceeding before the grand-;jury.
Q

Well, Mrs,

Bamberger you are putting to that

court the problem of trying to determine the relevancy when
perhaps the district judge would not be competent to determine
relevancy to a grand jury proceeding concerning Which he is
not fully advised.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Well, it seems to me, your Honor,

that the court could be fully advised and if the government
believes in a particular case that advising the court to the
extent that It need

advise the court In order to advise him

42
as to what Is going on —
Q

Advise them ex-party

MRS. BAMBERGER (Overriding):

In a specific

application so that each individual application can be
determined on its own merits, not a general across the board
application of the ex-party in camera proceeding in this
context.

The court does that in suppression hearings also

when the informant * s name must be kept secret for his
protection.

The government can go and request such an ex­

party revelation of the informer's whereabouts and name.
The same thing can be applied here on a case by case
basis.
Q

Mrs.

Bamberger, I think that one differing

factor between your application of the deposition rules of
relevancy in a .grand Jury proceedings is that in your civil
proceeding your* Issues are pretty well delineated by your
complaint and answer, whereas you don't have any similar format
for the grand jury proceeding that would enable you to say is
it or is it not within the limits framed by a particular set
of documents,
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Well, in the context of "'the grand

Jury proceedings — what you say about the civil proceedings
is correct and I would say that in the context of the grand
jury proceedings, the usual way it comes up is that the
government has collected some kind of case arid has prepared an

indictment and it goes to the grand jury to present as
evidence and it has a framework with which it could make a
presentation to a district court in a contempt proceeding
and it is not — the government is not functioning in a
vacuum.

They have obviously done work on this.
Now, in the context of the grand jury doing its

own investigation where there is no government presentation
the grand jury, X think, in order to demand an exemplar must
tell the district court, once again, that its investigation,
has led it to a certain point in which they believe that the
exemplar would be relevant in the sense that it would be
helpful in determining if this particular person was connected
to the crime which it was investigating.
Of course, in that case I would assume also they
would have to seek the aid of the U.S. Attorney in making
the application to the court

for a. petition in case the

witness refused to comply with the request of the grand jury.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Bamberger.

Mr. Laoovara, do you have anything further?
MR, LAC0VARA:

Unless the court has any further

questions, the government will waive rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Apparently none.

Thank you, the case is submitted.
