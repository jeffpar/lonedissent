MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smietanka, you can proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT

OF JOHN A. SMIETANKA ON

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMIETANKA:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Tha facts in this criminal case are a bit complex.
Essentially they arise from an incident which occurred in
Benton Harbor, Michigan, on November 5, 1962.

Two police

officers were riding in their patrol car, stopped a Pontiac
automobile, got out of their automobile, and as they were
walking up to the Pontiac, the driver and passenger of that
vehicle jumped out and began firing at them, striking both
officers, critically wounding both.

Both did survive.

Later that day — oh, incidentally, it might be noted
at. this point that after the officers had been hit, they did
fire their guns at the retreating vehicle Pontiac.
Later that day, Leroy Payne, the defendant in this
case, was arrested.
illegally.

A confession was obtained from him

And before Judge Philip Hadsell, Berrien County

Circuit Court, he pled guilty on December 14, 1962.
In February of 1963 ha gave testimony against his co-

4
defendant, Lionel Bradford»
On March 8, 1963, he was sentenced to IS to 40 years
by Judge Hadsell.
QUESTION:

Before we get past that, when he gave the

testimony against his co-defendant, did he acknowledge all the
facts that you have recited?
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

He did.

Was that testimony used against, him in any

way thereafter?
MR. SMIETANKA:

It was not.

Subsequently, in 1967, Mr. Payne appealed to the
Michigan Coiirt of Appeals and on May 12 of that year, 1967,
the remand order x^as entered by that court to the Berrien
County Circuit Court for an Evidentiary Hearing on the question
of voluntariness of his confession and voluntariness of his
plea.
Then Circuit Judge Chester Byrns conducted that.
Evidentiary Hearing in 1967, suppressed the confession, vacated
the plea, and set the case down for preliminary examination
whereupon it proceeded normally to trial.
Prior to trial, the same Circuit Judge, upon motion
of the defendant, granted change of venue to Grand Rapids,
which is Kent County, Michigan.
At the trial, certain evidence was entered by the
people and by the defense.

I will get to that evidence later

5
in my argument, if it please the Court.

QUESTION:

Now at this trial was his testimony against
(inaudible.)

HR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

It was not, your Honor.

Did some rule or law of Michigan prohibit

that?
MR. SMIETANKA:

The confession was not entered because

Judge Byrns specifically suppressed it.
QUESTION:

The confession.

I’m referring to his

affirmative testimony on the record in open court in Bradford's
trial.
MR. SMIETANKA:

No mention was to be made of any —

there was an agreement prior to trial, it is ray understanding,
.an order of the court that no mention was to be made either
of his confession or his plea or the testimony before Judge
Hadsoll in the bradford trial, and none was made.

In fact,

there was a great deal of cross-examination in the second trial
which led up to but did not even in the remotest sense mention
the fact he had testified in the prior trial or of any prior
proceedings.

There was no notification, no notice of any prior

proceedings given to the jury or anything -that had happened in
those prior proceedings.
QUESTION:

This was by virtue of an agreement, not by

6

law»
MR. SMIETANKA:

By virtue of an order of the court,

I recall.
QUESTION:

.An order of the court?

MR. SMIETANKA:

I8m not sure how exactly the order was

formulated, whether it was by stipulation of counsel, which I
believe was the case, and the court made an order based on that
understanding.

It may have been done in chambers and it. may

not have been formally filed, but that was the case.
QUESTION:

Neither the jury nor the judge in this trial

you are speaking of nov; were aware of testimony which amounted
to a judicial confession in the Bradford case?
MR. SMIETANKA:

The judge was, your Honor, because he

was the one who had vacated the prior conviction.
QUESTION:

Oh.

MR. SMIETANKA:

He was, as I said, sentenced to 25

to 50 years in the Michigan Department of Corrections.
He did appeal that conviction, raising as one of the
grounds an excessive sentence the second time around.
On June 23, 1969, this Court delivered the decision
in North Carolina v. Pearce.

Two days later, June 25, 1969, the

Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed both the conviction and
the sentence, that is, the sentence of Judge Byrns.

The Michigan

Supreme Court granted leave and apparently unanimously affirmed
the conviction, but in a 4 to 3 decision reversed the sentence

7

based on their interpretation, the Michigan Supreme Court's
interpretation, of the requirements of North Carolina v.
Pearceo

This Court granted certiorari on October 16, 1972«
The primary issue which is actually the last issue

that I raised in my brief is that of the retroactivity of
Worth Carolina v, Pearce.

First of all, I think we can agree

that the sentence was properly imposed technically, it was
well within the statutory maximum, that is, the statutory
maximum in Michigan for assault with intent to murder is life
imprisonment.
There are two issues dealt with by the Court in
Worth Carolina v. Pearce.

First is that of credit to

be

given to a person who has appealed a conviction and been
resentenced.

He must be given credit.

This was posited and

based on the Ex parte Lange and the double jeopardy clause.
But the second issue —
QUESTION:

That issue is not here.

MR. SMIETANKA:

That issue is not here, your Honor.

No question of that.
The second issue is that of whether or not a higher
sentence can foe imposed on the second sentence after an appeal,
successful appeal.

The Court in Pearce, of course, specifically

eliminated the question of double jeopardy and equal protection
clauses as being a bar to that sentence, that increased
sentence, but did say that due process requires that these

8
sentences be protected or be gox^erned by certain rules,, a
certain rule, namely, that first of all it be based on objective
identifiable conduct occurring after the first sentence, and
secondly, that the conduct must appear on the record.
On January 16 of this year, this Court delivered an
opinion in the case of Robinson v. Neil in which it. cited Pearce
without mentioning exactly the -- specifically defining how it
was cited, but it did note that Pearce indicated that Benton v.
Maryland should be applied retroactively.
The mentioning of North Carolina^ v^ Pearce, we feel,
by Mr. Justice Rehnquist was intended to deal with the double
jeopardy aspect of Pearce, that is, the credit for time served.
Further in that decision in Robinson this Court noted
that there is some conflict or difficulty of understanding the
retroactivity and prospectivity rulings of this Court and
referred the readers in the case of Desist v. United States
as summarised in the Linkletter type criteria and said that
first of all we must look to determine whether or not the
Linkletter criteria apply to the question of what right are we
dealing with, what right or what privilege newly defined are
we dealing with?

Then we must look to the purpose of the rule.

Desist also emphasised the fact that the purpose of the rule
newly defined is the most important aspect.
Looking at the particular right that we have, that is
the 14th Amendment due process clause, this Court has not held

9

it. in and of itself solely by citing and by having a right
affected by the due process clause does not in and of itself
require retroactivity.

A particular rule or the purpose to be

served by a particular rule may indicate that retroactivity
should take place, but it dees not require it.
It is the contention of the State of Michigan that
Linkletter criteria should be applied here for the following
reasons.

First of all, that, as I said, the due process clauses

does not in and of itself require retroactivity as would, as
Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted, as it would with the double jeopard;
clause in Waller v. Florida.

Essentially

the due process

clause and the weight as applied in this case assures fairness,
basic, simple fairness in the imposition of a second sentence.
We then move to the purpose of the rule.

Essentially

there are two purposes for the North Carolina v. Pearce
decision.
protect.

There are two things that the Court wanted to
First of all, that is the appellate process.

That is.

there should not be any unreasonable impediment to the exercise
of a right to appeal granted in this case by a State.

The

Court, as I recall, has not stated that there is a constitutiona:
right to appeal, but when it is applied, it must be applied —
there must be equal access to the court, there must be no
unreasonable distinctions.

And the unreasonable distinction

here is the reasonable fear that a second sentencing judge
will act vindictively against a particular defendant for having

10
appealed.
The second purpose is fco prevent, to deter improper
vindictive sentences upon defendants solely because they have
appealed and want a new trial.
Now, how do we apply the Pearce case

and how does

it fit within this question of retroactivity?
QUESTION:

First of all, was it the same judge in

both trials?
MR. SMIETANKA:

No, sir.

No.

Judge Philip Hadsell

imposed the first sentence, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SMIETANKA:

And Judge Chester Byrns imposed the

second.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

There ar© certain factors —

It was Judge Byrns who in fact had set

aside the original judgment and granted a new trial.
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

He wasn't an appellate judge, he was —

MR. SMIETANKA:

No.

The case was remanded in the

Michigan Court of Appeals for an Evidentiary Hearing.

And

at that Evidentiary Hearing, or after it, he decided first
that the confession should be suppressed, the plea vacated,
and it. was set for a new preliminary examination which was held
and proceeded to trial.

11
QUESTION;

The essence of that, is that, it allowed him

to withdraw his guilty plea,
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The thrust of that, holding.

MR. SMIETANKA:

That is correct.

The second thing which wa are trying to prevent, or the
Court is trying to prevent in Pearce is
sentencing.

the vindictive

How do we go about handling it?

First of all,

the Court said that the type of material, the factors to be
considered by a judge imposing a second sentence should be
limited to objective identifiable conduct occurring after the
first sentence.
“based upon."
ment.

Actually it didn’t say "limited to?" it said
And, secondly, there is a record-making require­

That is, this material must be placed on the record so

that a higher court can review7 the bases for sufficiency.
Now, retroactivity, it’s our contention, will not
further either of these goals.

First of all, those who have

been in the past deterred from appealing are not going to *'
have their wrongs righted by the retroactivity of Pearce

to

those cases where those who did appeal had a higher sentence
imposed.

That is, the actual wrong that the Court is dealing

with is the deterrence of those who want to appeal but are
afraid to appeal.

These are the people who have suffered the

appellate wrong that Pearce is trying to avoid.
Now, making these cases retroactive, making this case

12
retroactive to handle those, where the defendant did appeal,
obviously those who were afraid will never have justice done to
them.
Secondly, the prospective application of Pearce will
satisfy this appellate end of Pearce,

That is, from now on we

know, we convicted of crimes, we know that we will not be
subject to a vindictive sentence the second;time around and we
now can prosecute our appeal.
It should also be noted that if Pearce were to be
retroactively applied, it ttfould have to be logically a question
of each person who is sentenced would then have a right to come
in and say, "Well, I was deterred because of the fear of
unreasonable increase in sentence and, therefore, hear my
appeal," thus reopening, or opening for the first time, each
sentence at least and each conviction that has ever taken place
in which the defendant presumably is still alive.

Thus, the

proof problems would be immense.
QUESTION:

Do you have any figures as to how many

people convicted, successful on appeal, had their sentences
enhanced?
MR. SMIETANKA:

I have no figures, your Honor, except

for figures which were cited in the appendix to

Walsh v„

Coamonwealth, dealing there not with the type of review we have
here, the type of sentence we have here, but appellate review
of sentencing.

This carae about under the Massachusetts rule.

13

And in that there are many, many statistics.
QUESTION:
talking about.

I am talking about this big flood you are

I don't know how big this flood is.

MR. SMIETANKA:

Well, the flood, your Honor, would

come from every single conviction.
QUESTION;

Every conviction.

MR. SMIETANKA:

If a person could conceivably —

for example, a person is convicted, a hundred people are
convicted -~
QUESTION:

Are there few people in p@net.entiaries

today who were convicted who didn't appeal at all?
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

Well, there are some.

MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

I don't know how many there are.

There are some.

Well, they wouldn't be affected.

MR. SMIETANKA:

I think they would, your Honor, because

the appellate purpose of Pearce is to avoid the fear of a higher
sentence.

If a person in jail, in prison, does not appeal, it

may be for other reasons.

For example, he might be satisfied

with his conviction, satisfied that justice was done, but one —
QUESTION:

I'm only quarreling with your word "all,"

and I still say that a man in a penetentiary serving life
imprisonment wouldn't be worried about enhancement of his sentencs
Am I right or wrong?
MR. SMIETANKA:

That could be.

All right.

Furthermore, the sentencing process is to be protected
by Pearce and there the real evil is a question of actual
vindictiveness.

Now, that, is actual vindictiveness for having
And the way the Court handled that was to

formulate a rule of basically constructive

vindictiveness.

The Court said, all right, if these criteria which we are laying
down are not met, then in effect we are construing, we are
saying, that this sentence is reversible because it is technical!
it is based on a vindictive type of sentencing, it is construc­
tive vindictiveness.

But wa are actually trying to avoid

One was supplied at th© request of the

Michigan Suprema Court; the other he submitted to clarify one
matter in this Court.
Basically they can ba boiled down to two things.

First

of all, he felt that the behavior of Mr. Payne at the trial
warranted an increase in sentence, namely, after receiving a
new trial, he came in and the judge concluded and we believe
the jury must have concluded he did not tell the truth because,
for the following reasons:

The evidence presented by the

people was as follows:
First of all, Vic Yost, th© victim, made an in-court
identification of the defendant as the one who shot him.

He had

16
known him before and saw him, recognized him when the shots were
being fired, and testified that way in court.

Furthermore,

when he was laying in the street and the first officers came
up to the scene, they asked him, "Who shot you?"

They

found the car later, same license number, four bullet holes
in the trunk of the car, and that car was Leroy Payne's.
Next, the assault weapon was found and Leroy Payne's
fingerprint was found on it.
Against this, defendant testified to an alibi, namely,
"I x/as at home during the time — at all times.

I was home in

I did not shoot

Vic Yost, I did not drive my car that night."

The jury in

finding the man guilty beyond a reasonable doubt must have
found that the testimony of Mr. Payne was untrue.

in ma^y

cases, in insanity defenses and many other types of defenses,
this is not the case.

But when there is an alibi defense, and

especially in this case where it is so clearly — the positions
of the two parties are so clearly defined, the verdict of the
jury was that ha was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and must
have included a fact-finding that he did not tell the truth at
trial.
QUESTIONs

Nov/, the important thing, perhaps, or one

17
of the important things is the impact of this as compared with
the posture of tine case when it was before the original
sentencing judge»

At that time it was a different judge, was

it?
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

That judge had the impression,somewhere

I get it out of the record, that since he fully confessed and
expressed regret and sorrow for the shooting of these officers,
that he was a reasonable candidate for rehabilitation.

And did

not the second judge give some indication he thought this was
very much in marked contraist?
MR. SMIETANKA:

Yes, your Honor, that was my second

Taking this type of behavior at the second trial

together with the completely different approach that Mr. Payne
took at the first trial.

You will notice in the appendix on

pages 6 through 8 the sentencing transcript of Judge Hadsell.
He specifically notes the approach this defendant had taken
confessing his crime made him an apt candidate for rehabilita­
tion .
QUESTION:

Is it the State’s position that a State

may impose a heavier sentence in any case where someone does
not plead guilty but is convicted?
MR. SMIETANKA:

No.

No, that's not the case, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

What, else is there here?

The man maintained

18
his innocence in the second trial after having confessed it
in the first one, that's true,
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But you're saying the heavier sentence

was justified by his behavior, namely, in denying the crime and
maintaining his innocence?
MR. SMIETANKA:

There is a difference, your Honor,

we believe between maintaining a person's innocence.

That is a

Because I can say I'm innocent, but not come

in and testify to facts which are specific —
QUESTION:

So you do say then if a man gets up on the

stand and denies that he shot the weapon, that he shot the gun,
and then the jury finds him guilty, that the State is justified
in imposing a heavier sentence on him than his co-defendant who
pleaded guilty?
MR. SMIETANKA:

If the case — we are not dealing with

a co-defendant, your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know, but you would say that I suppose.

MR. SMIETANKA:

No, because I'm dealing with a question

We are dealing with the same person at

one time in 1963 having one attitude.

finds him innocent, you're entitled to punish him more heavily
than if he had pleaded guilty.
MR. SMIETANKA:

For the behavior which he has exhibited

after that first, sentence, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

What's the sense — this man pleaded guilty

and was convicted, and he appealed.

appeal so he could go hack and plead guilty again?

with perjury because of the —QUESTION:

All you can say was the jury didn't agree

Can you say any more than that?
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

The case —

The jury agreed with the State and did not

agree with the defendant.
MR. SMIETANKA:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's all.

MR. SMIETANKA:

But in finding that they agree with the

state, they have to completely disregard the testimony of the
defendant in this case.

Well, how else can you get a conviction?

QUESTION:

Well —

If you agree on one side, you vote that,

If you believe the other side, you vote that way.
MR. SMIETANKA:

That's correct, your Honor.

Is that this case?

However —

What makes this so

different, from the run of the mill criminal case?
QUESTION:

Is it

the essence of the verdict, in the

second trial cannot be read any other way than a finding that, he
testified falsely under oath and that they reached that finding
beyond a reasonable doubt?

But is that as important, really,

as the fact, that the judge said in sentencing after the trial
that, this man was a different person in terms of his probability
of rehabilitation and that that was the basis for his giving
the heavier sentence?
MR. SMIETANKA:

Yes, sir.

And all the testimony has

to do is to lead to that conclusion, basically the sentence is —

What, is it that is so different?

judge could take into consideration in imposing a higher

MR. SMIETANKA:

That is not what is required.

What else is there other than that?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Neuhard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. NEUHARD ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NEUHARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to step into the conduct area of the
argument at this time.

However, I feel there are a few

23

responsive notes I would like to make on the issue of retroac­
tivity .
I agree with the prosecutor when he states this is a
very complex problem.

This case has been in the courts now for

over ten years on various aspects.

In fact, there is a

collateral matter currently pending in the Sixth Circuit which
is the companion case to this case, the co-defendant Lionel
Bradford case is on appeal in the Sixth Circuit, again by the
people, because Lionel Bradford's conviction was vacated by the
District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan.

The basis

for the vacation was that Leroy Payne's testimony was used
*

to convict Lionel Bradford, and Judge Kennedy in vacating the
conviction held that because his confession was brutally beaten
*

out of him, it was as though the State knowingly used perjured
testimony to obtain a conviction of Bradford.
This would also get into the conduct argument, but —

24
original confession whan the man is in open court, in the
presence of a judge»
MR. NEUHARD:

That’s correct, your Honor,

in this

particular case, because of the unusual fact situation»

The

answer to that basically is that when Leroy Payne was picked
up by the police officers, he was in custody of three various
police departments, and there is no dispute that the reason for
vacating his guilty plea in this particular case was because
the confession was beaten out of him.

As a matter of fact,

at Lionel Bradford’s trial they wanted to introduce pictures
taken of Leroy Fayne after his confession and they were
V

excluded because they were inflammatory, that le. was in such
a brutally beaten condition, his thumbs were sprained, his face
v/as swollen, his genitals squeezed, until he was brought, into
a state where he confessed.

All of the activities from the

moment he was picked up until he testified in Lionel Bradford's
trial and was sentenced were while he was in the custody of the
police department, a space of five months, four and a half
months.

.And because of that fact, when he finally did testify

at Lionel Bradford's trial and he did go to sentencing, he
initially intended to sue the police department for the condition
in which *— the manner in which they treated him, and he
decided not to do so.

The people are appealing that case in

Our appendix in this particular race has

extensive quotations from the Bradford transcript that show the
manner of testimony of Leroy Payne plus all the testimony of
the police officers, both at Payne's second trial — or his
first, trial as it was after his plea, and Lionel Bradford's
trial, and it is set out at length for purposes of comparison
to show that Judge Hadsell knew as much as the second sentencing

25

judge, Judge Byrns, when he sentenced him.

As a matter of

fact, at tli® second sentencing. Judge Byrns said — I’m sorry.
At the first, sentencing Judge Hadsell said that when he gave
him 19 to 40 years in prison, that "I'm taking into account
your remorseful condition now, and if it continues, you might,
get released early."

Because Michigan has indeterminate

sentencing, it takes into account these vagaries of personality
changes which can occur.
this.

And Judge Hadsell was well aware of

He was well aware of what Payne had said at the first

trial, and he was grateful that Payne had decided not to sue
the police officers, which he has not done.

27

QUESTION:

Was there any contention that the guilty

plea was beaten out of him?
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, your Honor, in that the guilty plea

is a product of the coercion of the Barrien County police
officers.
QUESTION:

Well, but what I asked you, was there any

contention that the guilty plea itself was beaten out of him?
MR. NEUKARD:

You mean while he was in court was he

being coerced at that particular time?

true plea, although Mr.

Rayne, once he was out of the custody

of the Berrien County police officers did begin the appellat®
process and when he came back to trial, he testified that he
had nothing to do with it.
QUESTION:

How long after the original plea of guilty

and sentencing did he move for a new trial -- well, move to
withdraw his plea of guilty?
MR. NEUHARD:

Well, there was the initial four months.

I would say about 3 months after he pled guilty until the
Bradford trial.

Arid then it would be a period of about two

years, I would imagine before the first motion for a new trial

29

was made , and that was in front of Judge Hadsell„
that tliers was a

Following

new motion for new trial in front of Judge

Byrns at which Judge Byrns, the second sentencing judge, granted
it.

In between those two motions for new trial, there was the

appeal to the Court, of Appeals for the remand for an Evidentiary
Hearing for determination of the circumstances under which the
plea was made.

So it would be —

MR. NEUHARD:
was not true in fact.

Well, she didn’t go so far as to say it
She did say it was the product of

coercion of the worst circumstances and should not have been
injected into the trial by the people, knowing these facts to
be true.
If I may, there are a few points I would like to make
on the .issue of retroactivity.

We feel our brief is adequate

on this point, but there are several points that should be
brought out, that this issue was pending on appeal when the
Pearce decision was released.
authority.

It was based on prior Michigan

The case in the Michigan Court of Appeals when it

was released two days subsequent to the release of Pearce took
into account peripherally the Pearce decision, but the
majority was a 2-to-l decision, but because the second

30
sentencing judge knew more about the defendant than the first
judge because h© had taken the plea that affirmed the conviction,,
Prior Michigan law says very much like Pearce that if the
situation is such that the sentence might have been the
product of vindictiveness and no reason can be put forth for the
sentence increase, then the sentence should be set aside.
QUESTION:

What year was this sentence, the first

sentence set aside?
MR.

NEUHARD:

The first sentence, your Honor, or first,

conviction?
QUESTION:

His first conviction?

MR. NEUHARD:

His first conviction was set aside, I

believe it would have been, in 1967, I believe.
QUESTION:

1S67.

And the -

Are they still setting — is there still a

procedure in Michigan to set aside guilty pleas based on
allegedly coerced confessions?
MR. NEUHARD:

Well, there is, your Honor.

It's the

basic procedure we have for challenging the validity of a
guilty plea itself.
QUESTION:

You may appeal — after a guilty plea, you

may appeal the admissibility, say, of illegally seized evidence.
MR. NEUHARD:

Well, you can, your Honor.

You can

appeal anything you want in challenging the voluntariness of
a confession itself, because Michigan has a statute since 1875 .
QUESTION:

But you don’t have a system as in New York

31
where if you make a motion to suppress certain evidence and
it's denied, you can plead guilty and then appeal the
of your suppression, motion?
MR. NEUHARD:

Your Honor, it's sort of -- yes, you

can do it, but there is no set-up procedure to do that specifica 1

express

product.

That's correct, your Honor.

Likewise, that's the contention that the defendant
made in Leionel Bradford, that his testimony at the trial was
a direct product of the coercion he was under during the time
ha was in the custody of the Berrien County police officers.
QUESTION.-.

Does Michigan have any statute allowing

some particular time limitation on withdrawing a guilty plea
after sentence?
MR. NEUHARD;

No, your Honor.

high dispute in Michigan right now.

This is an area

of

There is some authority

for the proposition that between the time of the plea and
before sentencing, that the defendant has almost a right, to
withdraw the plea, but he has to set forth good reasons.

And

after the plea, then the burden is on the defendant to show
why the plea itself was invalid.
QUESTION:

You mean after sentence?

I®. NEUHARD;

That's correct, your Honor.

Because

that time period between the plea and the sentence where he has

32

mors of a right to withdraw it than after the sentence.

After

sentencing in Michigan there is a very definite data by which it
is the normal appellate process for showing that the plea
itself was invalid.
QUESTION:

On the reasons given, is it required that

he assert innocence of the crime?
MR. NEUHARD;

Not in the State of Michigan, your

Honor.
I would like to get to the issue, if I may —
QUESTION:

In view of the sense of conduct, that

wouldn't have been a barrier to him, because he did then —
MR.’ NEUHARD:

That's correct, your Honor, he did assert

innocence when he got back to trial.
On that point, I think the underlying premises and
difficulties of this particular case is that you have two
unique elements in this particular case. You have a plea trial
situation, and you also have a situation where a man vacates
a plea, goes to trial, takes the stand and testifies in his
own defense.

Both of these were the main product, which Judge

Byrns used in increasing his sentence.
We contend that the first issue, that is, that he
knew more about the defendant than the first judge in the manner
of the crime itself is not factually true, not factually
correct.

Judge Hadsell knew as much about it if not more

because both police officers testified at Bradford's trial — he

33

knew more about, the crime when he sentenced Payne»
he said that at the sentencing itself,

and in fact

"I know all there is to

know about this particular case when I invoke this sentence*" —
than the second judge did* Judge Byrns.
It also leads up to the question of remorse and the
question of perjury.
QUESTION:

Would your position be different if he

hadn't tried Bradford?
MR. NEUHARD:
not.

No, your Honor, it. would not.

We do not see any reason whatsoever

It would

in increasing a

man’s sentence from 19 to 40 years to 25 to 50 years that the
State has put forth as a valid reason for doing so.

Michigan

has indeterminate sentencing which takes into account all the
vagaries of personality and character differences when they
have the man in the prison itself.

They have a psychiatric

department at the prison to take these things into account.
Also, on the subsequent conduct —
QUESTION:

Absent a Bradford type trial, the second

judge very likely might know more about the defendant if he is
tried than a judge who just took a plea of guilty.
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

In Michigan also we have —

That isn’t the kind of information that

Pearce seems to contemplate,
MR. NEUHARD:

No, it isn’t.

We contend it’s not

conduct occurring, first of all, after the first sentence.

It’s

34

nothing over which the defendant has any control.
QUESTION:

But it may be information that the first

judge didn't have.
MR. NEUHARD:

There may in fact be a situation where

the judge doesn't have the same information
has.

the second judge

But we contend it's just not the kind of information that

Pearce contemplated.

Michigan has a presentence report

•1. «tV

procedure whereby a probation officer investigates a total
crime and then reports to the judge for purposes of sentencing.
It's a very exact kind of thing and goes beyond even analysing
the crime.

He goes out to the neighborhood and talks to the

neighbors of the particular defendant, any kinds of information.
QUESTION:

With reference to that, in Judge Byrns’

second affidavit he says that he did receive and study prior
to sentencing Mr. Payne a supplemental presentence report
which he cannot tinder the present Michigan law make public
but which a higher court than this one can order produced.
Was that ever called for?
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, your Honor.

As soon as we

ws

did not get into this case until November 29th of last year.
And as soon as we entered the case we made a motion for
production of that presentence report.

We also included in

the appendix to our brief the ruling Judge Byrns made
on our motion for production ©f that report.
access to it.

And w® also quoted him

He denied us

two cases in Michigan

35
now that, have been on the books for over two years which allow
the sentencing judge to release it.

It*s within his discretion»

It's not mandatory that it be released, but he has the right
to release it.
Mr. Payne

He denied us access to that.

So that puts

in the position of challenging information that he

has no way of knowing what is in there.

Its s a very difficult

procedure at best to put a defendant in when he is contemplating
as appeal.

He has no control over the —

QUESTION:

Wasn't there that issue in Williams v.

New York?
MR. NEUHARD:

Well, we agree with the basic premise

of Williams v. New York, that the judge should know as much
about the individual as he possibly can when he sentences him.
But what we are talking about here is a second sentencing
when you have other constitutional rights which are at stake.
It's the constitutional rights not only of the defendant I
should make clear, but of the court system itself, that there
is a very good chance

if

Mr. Payne knew his sentence was

going to be increased, he might not ever have appealed.

And

the kind of activity that went on in this case, with his
confessions and the plea as a product of the confessions were
beaten out of him would never be apparent to a supervising
court.

We have in Michigan on® court of justice, and it’s

their duty to supervise the lower courts.

And if they are

prevented,this road of access to show the appellate courts what

36

is going on in the lower courts is denied, then you really are
perverting the system of justice that our State has established.
And we can’t see the presentence reports.
QUESTION?
of

You're emphasising the fact,the circumstances

this first confession right after the commission of the

crime, after Payne was taken into custody,

but we can't avoid

looking, can we, at the record which shows the police officer
identified Payne by sight and that the bullet holes ware found
in. the back of his car and that the pistol, Payne’s pistol, was
found to be the pistol that had been used to shoot the officers?
Are those factors not all part, of the whole mosaic here?
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, they are, your Honor, and they are

necessarily so in many criminal convictions where the defendant
does take the stand and asserts his explanation of the charges
against, him.

And we contend that's what the charge of perjury

is to take into account.

And what you are allowing her®, after

a man has appealed, a man exercises his right to appeal, is that
if he comas back into court, they are going to allow to increase
his sentence on perjury 7 years, 7 years he had already served.
He can now have his sentence increased by 7 years because of
alleged perjury without any kind of hearing, without ability to
see the presentence report upon which allegedly this sentence —
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the judge in the

trial, the judge whose sentence is under consideration now, was
not entitled to conclude that this man was a less probable

37

prospect; for successful rehabilitation than the first sentencing
judge had concluded when he had expressed sorrow over his
conduct?
MR* NEUHARD:

There are many answers I can give to

But one of the primary answers, I think,

that, your Honor.

that's important to recognize is that this man had a 19 year
minimum at this time to 40 years in prison, that most reports
done on prisons, including the President’s Report on Crime
and Correction, indicate that sentencing is not an exact
science at all.

And this kind of --

QUESTION:

That does not constitute the question I

just put to you,
MR* NEUHARD:

Because what you are allowing, because

of this idea that because one judge —- the impact it has on
one judge is different from the impact it has on the second
judge, necessarily, his candidate for rehabilitation,allows
him to increase the sentence.
on this is that a man is now
QUESTION:

That’s 7 years.

And the impact

serving in prison.

Don’t you think his conduct in the meantime

is something the judge may take into account?
MR. NEUHARD:

I do, your Honor.

And this man, the

judge said at the second sentencing that his conduct in
prison was exemplary and that’s the only thing that prevented
him
QUESTION:

I’m not talking about his conduct in

38

prison,

I’m talking about his conduct outside the prison,
MR, NEUHARD:

Welly if it* s conduct outside the prison

as w-a are into the case , the only conduct which has occurred
after the first sentencing was this alleged perjury that
occurred inside the second trial.

Now, the judge never in any

of his affidavits alleged that the perjury occurred inside the
second trial.

He was referring to between the first instance,

those pretrial — in the first instance and the second trial
that the allegation that there was internal perjury which
occurred is because he asserted alibi defense.

His alibi

defense was -that his car was stolen, his gun was in the car,
and it was used unbeknownst to him.
Wow, if there is an allegation of perjury here, I
think this Court said many years ago in in re Murchinson which
dealt with a grand jury proceeding that a judge can't be at
one time the prosecutor, the judge, and the sentencer in a
given case.
QUESTIOW:

Let's assume that at the sentencing after

the second trial there is no, the defendant doesn’t say anything
but that, "I’m innocent," and maintains his innocence.

Are

you suggesting that invariably that's an invalid factor for
a judge to take into account in sentencing -MR. NEUHARD;
QUESTION;

At second sentencing, your Honor.

Let's just say first sentence, second

sentence, third sentence, any sentencing, a judge may not

39

take into consideration the fact that the defendant denies
his guilt and shows no remorse whatsoever»
on© side or the other on that.

I'm not arguing

I'm just wondering what your

position is.
MR. NEUHARD:

I think there wa3 one comment that was

made, although it's a very difficult line to draw.

We said

in our brief, it was quoted in People v. Bottany, a Michigan
Court of Appeals case, which talks about the lack of remorse
which has — the line that was drawn, it says, "You can take
into account the positive aspect of remorse, but you can't
penalize the man who stands adamantly before the court and
protests his innocence, because he may indeed be innocent, or
ha may be an individual —
QUESTION:

Here it says that it's unconstitutional

to take that factor into account.
MR.

NEUHARD:

That's correct.

You can't punish him

for not showing remorse.
QUESTION:

If you're wrong on that, you don't have

as good a case here, do you?
MR. NEUHARD:

If I'm wrong on the fact that you can’t

take into account remorse?

No, your Honor, I contend that

tie situation, the comparison aspect of, first of all, that

you can't usa a comparison aspect, between the first incidence
aid the second incidence on the issue of remorse because it is
highly questionable why he was remorseful in the first place.

40

And internally,, whether it's the first, second, third, or
fourth sentencing is important when you talk about considering r
in this particular case.

That is because you have a competing

right to appeal in this particular case and any man who appeals
is thinking about going to trial and he would be put in that
position of claiming his innocence at the trial itself.

And

what you are necessarily saying is that the sentence can be
increased.

We think it is important that there is a difference

between the first and the second sentencing on this remorse
issue.
QUESTION:

I take it the State’s position is very

close to saying that Pearce would never apply where in the
first proceeding there is a plea of guilty which is set aside
and then there is a retrial and conviction.
MR. NEUHARD:

I wouldn't choose to speak for what the

State's position would be.
QUESTION:

Well, arguably in any one of those

situations, a3 long as the judge said, "I have seen something —
I have made a reassessment of the defendant’s character that
the first judge didn't have."
MR. NEUHARD:

I'm not quite sure I understand the

point you are getting at, sir.

As far as the' vagaries of

having the man plea guilty, then appealing and having the plea
set aside, there are a multitude of reasons why that plea might
be set aside.

In this particular case —

41
QUESTION:

The other side of the coin is

that your

position is that you should — a defendant's conduct in the
second trial in the courtroom should never be sufficient to
evade Pearce.
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, that's precisely our point, your

Honor, because necessarily in the process of an appeal of a
guilty plea that was improper, the contemplation by the
defendant that he is going to trial and that if he only sits
there and does nothing, just simply let's his lawyer assert, his
innocence by saying, prove my guilt at this particular time,
there are so many reasons why he might be sitting there that
it is very difficult to predict just what —
QUESTION:

That’s quite different really, isn't it,

if the man simply pleads innocent and says to the State, prove
ray case, or even if he takes the stand and testifies on issues
that he could b© believed on consistently with an overall
verdict of guilty, compared to the getting on the stand and
saying that, I was such and such a place and not where the
crime was committed.

That there are all different ’wavs in

which he could legally assert his innocence.
MR. NEUHARDs
with that.

That's correct, your Honor.

We agree

And because of that very factor, wa think that

there should be a due process hearing on the nature of his
changed testimony which might necessarily exist in all cases
where a plea has been vacated and the trial occurs.

He is

42
entitled to be heard as to why it occurred in this particular
way .
QUESTION:

Was there such a hearing?

MR. NEUHARD:

Weil, in Michigan, your Honor, you have

a right to allocution which the lawyer exercised and which the
judge -—
QUESTION:

The defendant was there, wasn’t he?

MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION;

That5s correct, your Honor.

And didn’t the judge say what he took into

account?
MR. NEUHARD:

Your Honor, at the first sentencing, he

stated the iaain reason why he was increasing the sentence was
because he noxv knows inore about the crime than the first,
judge knew about the crime.

And we are contending that that is

just factually incorrect, because that's the major fact we took
into account that the worst for Mr. Payne that can happen in
this is that it should be remanded for resentencing at this
particular time.
QUESTION:

Just as a matter of time and sequence, he

was bound to knew more because he knew about the intervening
Bradford trial which the first judge couldn’t have known about
because it hadn’t happened.
MR. NEUHARD:

Well, the first judge did know about

the intervening Bradford —
QUESTION:

Ha didn’t, know about it when ha sentenced,

43
hira.,
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, he did.

He sat on the Bradford

trial.
QUESTION:

But in the first trial when he sentenced

this man — had the sentence not been —
MR. NEUHARD:

They held off sentencing until he had

testified.
QUESTION:

After the Bradford trial.

MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

After th® Bradford trial.

I see.

MR. NEUHARD:

So the first judge knew necessarily all

there was to know about the particular crime itself.
Now, our basic contention is that if there are
occurrences within the second trial itself which might or might
not amount to perjury, that because of this Court’s statements
in cases like Morrisey v. Brewer and Humphrey v, Katy, the
recent cases, that you should be entitled to some due process
hearing whenever the sentence is going to be increased or the
terms of your confinement are going to be changed to give the
defendant an opportunity to com© forth and respond to those
claims.

In Michigan right now this is so close,

what

i

happened in this particular case is very close to hi re Murchins.
You have a judge sitting up there without any kind of an
opportunity to approach the judge, have the defendant take the
stand and testify, you have an increase of 7 years on the

44
minimum and, I believe it was, 10 years on the maximum.

That

kind of a procedure where the terms of confinement and the
length of confinement can be changed without any kind of a
hearing, I feel, is just reprehensible under these fact
situations.
QUESTION:

The original sentence could be imposed.

MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION?

Pardon?

In Williams we said the original sentence

could be imposed on that basis, didn't we?
MR. NEUHARDs

Well, we have no qualms with the original

sentence being raimposed, in this particular case.
QUESTION:

Including the death sentence.

The choice

between life and death was made in Williams, wasn't it?
MR. NEUHARD:

Yes, your Honor, but in this particular

case what we are concerned with is the actual increase in the
punishment or the potential for rehabilitation, as you will,
of this particular individual of 7 years.

He had served at.

this particular time 7 years of imprisonment.

He went back to

court and got almost basically all that time over again to do
with no time given for that 7 years he served.
QUESTION:

I can understand his discomfiture over that.

We can all understand that. But

as a practical matter, in

your experience as a public defender, isn't it a fair statement
that at the end of a trial or at the end of a guilty plea,
a judge frequently may have a certain impression about what he

45
is going to do.

He may indicate to counsel that he will very

likely grant probation,, but sentence is deferred until he
gets -the presentence report.

And when he gets the presentence

report, and then he will not consider probation because at the
time of the guilty plea and the right of allocution occurs,
th© defendant, the man is putting his best foot forward.

But.

when the prosentence report comes in, as in Williams, a whole
new panorama is opened to the judge.

As a practical matter,

doesn't that happen?
MR. HSUHARD;
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, it does.

So that the situation can change by

virtue of different impressions about the prospective
rehabilitation.
MR. NEUHARD:

That's correct, your Honor, and it's

that very great danger that we are talking about in this
particular case.
QUESTION:

You say it takes a due process hearing to

evaluate that second process?
MR. NEUKARDs

That's correct, your Honor, because

what they are alleging her© is a separate crime and they are
giving him no opportunity to be heard on that particular crime.
QUESTION:

In Williams, going back to Williams, in

Williams the sentencing judge actually, as I recall it, went
around the neighborhood and talked to people and got information
about him, and then had a presentence report perhaps in

46

addition.

And then on the basis of that ex parte information

in which the defendant couldn't have any possibility of
challenging any of the information, he said this man is going
to be sentenced to death.

Now, wasn't that the whole issue,

that there was no due process question involved in Williams?
MR. NEUHARD:

We do not relent for a minute on the

position that we should have access to that presentence report
and have some control over the information being generated by
that particular report.

Those cases — we have over 500 cases

in Michigan right now pending in our office, and that's on®
of the major issues we are bringing to the courts continually
is the right to see that particular presentence report and the
right to respond to th© information within it.
But accepting the fact that a presentence officer will
do his job properly, which we do not know whether it occurred
in this case or not, they had all the opportunity to do that
at the first sentencing.

Now, in this particular case, after

that first sentencing, his conduct was exemplary, and the judge
noted that on the record.

That's what prevented him, he said,

from giving the man life in prison.
QUESTION:

His conduct in prison.

MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

Where else would he be on a 19-year —

He would be in trial, the second trial.

MR. NEUHARD:

In the course of the second trial, when

the potential charge is one that amounts to perjury, which in

47
this particular case it was.

If this were any other individual,

he would have a right at that particular time to have
QUESTION:

Mr. Neuhard, is it clear in this case

that the second judge when the second sentence was imposed
took into account in assessing the defendant's character and
his conduct since the first trial compared his conduct with
his conduct at his guilty plea?
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION?

Yes, your Honor, they did.

So he is saying that while «- he had read

the transcript at. the first guilty plea, is that right, or not?
MR.NEUHARD:
guilty plea?

He read the transcript of the first

I would assume so from his comments.

QUESTION:

Did he say

that while he had confessed -

his guilt at the first guilty plea, he denies it now?
MR. NEUHARDs

Yes, your Honor.

He talked about the

lack of remorse.
QUESTION:

Now, isn't this using a guilty plea that

has been set aside as invalid as the product of a coerced
confession, isn't it using that guilty plea in some way in a
subsequent proceeding?
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

Do you make that point or not?

MR. NEUHARD:

We do inferentially, your Honor, in that

we consider any consideration of a lack of remorse was
improper, and that gets to the point where you said h©

48

confessed in the first trial —
QUESTION %

That would be the same point even if he

never knew the man had pleaded guilty the first time.
MR.

KEUHARD:

Well,, he didn't state it that way, though,

your Honor, that because you pled not guilty in this trial.,
I’m taking into account your lack of remorse.

He referred bade

to the original proceedings in this particular case because, as
his first affidavit stated in this particular case, of the many
points he made,about 8 of them dealt with his increased
♦

knowledge about the defendant and also his apparent lack of
remorse that he had at one time expressed for the shooting of
the two police officers.

And it was directly related to the

product of the first pleas.

There was no contention it was

internal to the second trial and the sentencing, that h® was
internally consistent.
QUESTION:

You’re not attacking the basic conviction,

just the increase in the sentence.
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.

So that means that in this Court here and

now today, it must be accepted that the verdict was correct
and the judgment of conviction was correct, namely, that he
did shoot these police officers.
MR.NEUHARD:

Wall, the verdict as it stands, that the

jury found that he in fact had shot the police officers, is
at this time a valid verdict.

49

QUESTIONS

At this time.

Are you suggesting a

challenge to it?
MRo NEUHARD:

I won't speak for what Mr. Payne intends

to do with that particular conviction as far as collaterally
attacking it.

But at this time this Court can approach the

conviction as being valid, the conviction itself.

In that

particular proceeding, as I indicated, Mr. Payne took the
stand and testified as to why he didn't have the car and the
gun.

The jury chose to believe the State’s evidence, and

whatever inferences are permissible to draw from that, this
Court, I think, is engaging in speculation compared to the right
he was attempting to assert which is the right to appeal, his
right to have a higher court review what occurred in the lower
court.

And that primarily is the thrust we are making then,

if this particular Court will allow a lower court to take
into account internally the lack of remorse that he shows at
the second trial or comparative between the plea and the trial,
that it is highly speculative compared to the rights which are
being asserted.

And also that Michigan's present sentencing

scheme takes these factors into account, that the indeterminate
sentencing by its very nature is taking into account the
character and make-up of the individual.
Further, I would like to point out to this Court that
Judge Hadsell, the first sentencing judge on the issue of
remorse, said that you may get out early if your present

50

condition continues.

He was implying directly in there what

the Department of Corrections generally can do, which is hold
a man longer if ho is recalcitrant, if he is not showing
positive signs to being able to return to the community, that
Judge HadseXl was very aware of this particular problem.

And

to allow perjury to b© — and I think it's very important to
state here — to allow perjury to increase a sentence in a
second trial is a very dangerous precedent because anybody who
appeals from a guilty plea and then goes to trial and states
his reasons and is convicted would necessarily tinder that
implication be guilty of perjury.

And it does away completely

with the requirements of trying a man for perjury.

And that's

a very dangerous precedent whether you are talking about
appellate matters or whether you are talking about simply the
first sentencing matter that it's very important that an
individual feel that he can take the stand and state what he
wants to state and that he lias a due process right following
that particular statement if he is going to be charged with
perjury.
QUESTION:

what's perjury in Michigah?

MR. NEUHARD:

Five years?

In this particular case it would have

been life imprisonment.
QUESTIONs

For perjury?

MR. NEUHARD:

That's correct, your Honor.

The perjury

statute in Michigan states that the maximum of 15 years in

51
prison, unless the crime of which you were charged was life
imprisonment, and in this particular case the crime was life
imprisonment potentially, and it carried a life imprisonment.
QUESTIONs

You know there wasn1t much percentage in

fell© prosecution prosecuting him for perjury in light of the
heavy sentence he already had.
MR.

WEUHARD:

Well, your Honor, it would have

increased hi3 sentence.

If they felt that it was important

for his sentence to be increased because of the nature of his
perjury, then I feel they could have gone to trial and the
judge certainly at that time was free to give him anything up
to life.

But he would have at least had the opportunity to

appear in court and attempt to justify why he said what he did.
And we have all the concomitant rights that go with it.

He

would at least have had a hearing which in this particular case
he didn't even get a hearing, let alone a trial on the matter
to be in front of a jury.
QUESTION:

Bid he not have a trial before a jury?

MR. NEUHARD;
QUESTION:

Because, as I indicated —

Not on the issue of perjury, your Honor.

Well, when a defendant takes a stand and

testifies, does he not tender the truth or falsity of his own
testimony?
MR. NEUHARD:
he takes the oath.

That is correct, your Honor.

That's why

And the whole point behind — if the oath

itself is not followed, that's why we have a perjury statute

52
in Michigan that is so severe, because of the collateral
consequences of it.
QUESTION;

Referring to Judge Byrns' affidavit

executed last November 29th and appearing on page 21a of the
appendix, the paragraph 4 there seems to be an open invitation
to this Court to order production of the supplemental presentence
report.

At least that's the way I read it.

It’s an affidavit

filed in this Court and it says he can't make it public, but
"a higher court than this one can order produced."
as an open invitation.

X read that

Would you have any objection if we

accepted that invitation?
MR. NEUHARD:

I would not, your Honor, but I think I

would point out to the Court that in our Appendix A, we have
the motion which we made for the production of the presentence
report, and in that particular motion itself —QUESTION:

Appendix what page?

MR. NEUHARD:

It's page la of our appendix in our

brief.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. NEUHARD:

Of your —

Of our brief on appeal, the white copy,

your Honor.
On page 3a of that particular appendix, Judge Byrns
states, "This court has followed a policy generally in sentencing
to tell the defendant exactly x^hat it is in the presentence
report that has influenced him and to give the defendant the

53
opportunity to explain or to correct."
In this particular case, we are relying on Judge
Byrns' statement that he has stated all the reasons why he
increased the sentence and there is nothing in that particular
presentence report.
QUESTION:

What page was that on?

QUESTION:

Well,he says there is.

MR. NEUHARD:

That’s on page 3a of our appendix, your

Honor, the bottom paragraph.
QUESTION:

He applied, at least I thought, that there

was something.
MR. NEUHARD:

I think, your Honor, there is a clear

implication that there might be something in there, but assuming
he followed his general policy which he stated here, then he
would have stated all his reasons.
QUESTION:

We assume there is nothing.

Well, one who saw it could determine,

could resolve the ambiguity.
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.

Are you familiar with the case of Giles

in Maryland?
MR. NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

Not directly, your Honor.

That's a case where this Court called up

a presentence report and turned a result on what we found in it.
MR. NEUHARD:

Your Honor, I would like to point out

one factor in this particular case which I mentioned at the

54
outset which is this is a very complex case»

Judge Byrns has

now had four opportunities to say why he sentenced this particu­
lar man.

At the first sentencing he stated,

you because of your appeal.

I’m not sentencing

Then he had the second affidavit,

the affidavit in this Court, and he had the opportunity and our
motion for production of the presentence report.

And we feel

that I don’t know how many more opportunities a man should be
given to state why he sentenced a man, but that it should be
within the confines of these particular affidavits.
QUESTION:

Well, this would be within the confine of

the affidavit of November 29, paragraph 4, wouldn’t it?
MR. NEUHARDs

Yes, your Honor, but I feel that according

to the way I read his implications, there should not be anything
there.

But again it makes it difficult for counsel to approach

the affidavit if this is the method that's to be employed.
QUESTION:

Certainly it does.

That's the reason I

asked the question if you would have any objection.
MR. NEUHARDs

Well, your Honor, in that I don’t expect

there is anything in there and if there is, I would be very
surprised by his comment, and I would object to it,

ff this

Court feels there is something in there, not having the
opportunity to respond to it, because we made the good faith
effort to get it and told Judge Byrns he had the power to
release it to us, and it was denied to us.

So I assume there

is nothing in there, that we have before us on the affidavits —

55

which the Michigan Supreme Court, by the way, requested from
him — his reasons for the increase.

And in the affidavit he

gave to them, whatever he stated they found wasn't enough in
which he stated the subsequent conduct, and he also stated the
lack of remorse and the contrary testimony.

They found, as a

matter of fact and law, that it was not enough.
QUESTION;

This is the new one filed, as you know,

in this Court, and he does make this reference in paragraph 4
and does point out that a higher court, presumably tills one,
can order it to be produced.
MR. NEUHARD;

I know he said that, your Honor, and

I am at a loss as to what — we did everything we could do to
obtain that in time to come to this Court, and we have not
been able to obtain it.

I would assume there is nothing in

there.
QUESTION;

He didn't offer to give it to you.

MR. NEUHARD;
QUESTION;

Pardon?

In this affidavit he didn't offer t© give

it to you.
MR. NEUHARD;
QUESTION;

That's correct, your Honor, he did not.

I suppose there is nothing in the record

that would show how long a hearing was held at the time ©f the
original guilty plea and sentence, but I suppose also that that’?.
a relatively brief procedure.
MR. NEUHARD;

In Michigan, as a matter of fact, it is

56

a very brief procedure»
QUESTION:

And the judge says in his affidavit that

without going into what is already part of the record — and I
an inserting because there is antecedent ”1“ — was greatly
influenced by the brutal details of the crime which over a perioc
of three days plus its, the judge’s, own impressions of the
defendant during these days plus the impression of his testimony
during those trials.

So the judge has a great deal more in

that sense, a better opportunity to observe and draw inferences
from the conduct of the defendant than the sentencing judge
on a guilty plea.

Would you agree?

MR. NEUHARDs

No, I would not, not in this case, your

Honor, because th© first judge had sat in the trial of Lionel
Bradford and heard all the testimonies.

In fact, both police

officers testified there, not just one as they did at his
second trial.
QUESTION:

Then you are saying that when he said

that, this is not true?
MR. NEUHASD:

That's correct, your Honor.

I'm suggest­

ing ha was unaware at the time or just didn't take into account
the fact that Judge Hadsall had known all the facts.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, what he said at the

second sentencing, ha in effect retracted in the affidavit he
filed in this court, because h© now acknowledges what he said
was not the case at th© second sentencing, namely, that Judge

57
Hadsell did have the opportunity to know all about the case
because he presided at the Bradford trial.
MR, NEUHARD:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.

And that first comes in the record when we

get the affidavit here in this Court.
MR. NEUHARD:

That’s correct, your Honor.

Are there any further questions?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That will be all, Mr.

Neuhard.
MR. NEUHARD:

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. SMIETANKA
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMIETANKA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

With regard to the case of the presentence report, in
the argument before Judge Byrns and prior to it in the formal
argument, the actual argument before him before the final
ruling was put on the record and included in the appendix,
it was suggested to Mr. Benson by myself and also, I believe,
by the judge that we would have no objection, and we suggested
that he come up to this Court and request the Court to free
this, to bring this presentence report up to this Court.

So

it’s not a question of exhausting all alternatives because that

58

alternative was suggested to him.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting giving him a copy of ife?

MR. SMIETANKA:

This would then put the burden on

this Court, if the Court wanted the defendant to have a copy
of it, the judge would have no objection, could have no
objection.
QUESTION:

But the only way the defendant can see it

is for us to order it.

That's the only way in the world.

That's the way the ruling was made.
MR. SMIETANKAs

Yes, your Honor.

And the reason for

it was that because of Judge Byrns' feelings on the matter of
disclosure of presentence reports which h© included in his
ruling, the reasons why he feels they should be confidential,
namely, to protect the sources of the information, not to have;
i

these sources dry up, and to give the judge as much latitude
as possible to consider information both favorable and
unfavorable to the defendant.
With regard to the time between the original sentence
and the original appeal, there was some doubt as to how long
that was.

The record will indicate it was 3 years.
The case of Murcjhinson was cited several times, and

we feel that it's not applicable at all.

In that case we are

dealing with a determination by the same judge and only by
that judge of whether or not perjury had been committed when
the first determination was made, the perjured statement or

59

the alleged perjured statement was made in a one-man grand
jury situation.

There was only one person there to hear the

perjury* and that was the one-man grand juror himself.

And

the Court required that that type of proceeding required a full
hearing by another judge for th© contempt citation to stand.
And furthermore* with regard to the issue of perjury*
I'm not absolutely sure, but I believe that th© law in
Michigan a3 it stood at the time of the second trial or the
*

trial was not that it was punishable by life, but rather by
15 years and that it was subsequently amended to make it life.
I believe there was some question in that area.
know the citation of that.

But I do not

I can't give it to the Court.

Thank you very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Neuhard, you were not appointed by the Court in
the usual procedure, but you came here at our request
indirectly, at least, and on behalf of the Court I want to
thank you for your assistance not only to your client, but
your assistance to the Court.
Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 1:56 p.m., the argument in the aboveentitled case was submitted.]
