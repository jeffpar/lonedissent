ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. HIRSHOWITZ, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
please the court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case involves the question of the

validity of a section of the New York State Civil Service
law, which a three-judge district court held invalid.

The

particular language that the court dealt with is found on
page 91 of the record in a footnote, "Except as herein other­
wise provided, no person shall be eligible for appointment
for any position in the competitive class

unless he is a

citizen of the United States."
There is a second subdivision which doesn't appear
In the record but which is discussed in the opinion, which
provides that vrtiere the appointing authority cannot find
any person to fill a position, he may apply to the local
Civil Service Commission or to the state Civil Service
Commission and if they are satisfied that there is no one
available for that position, they may certify this appoint­
ment which lasts only until the end of the year and cannot
be continued unless this appointee has taken steps to become
a citizen by filing a declaration of intention.

The particular appellees here were appointed by the
City of New York as provisional appointees.
never took any examination.

That means they

As provisionals, they were entit­

led to hold their position at the discretion of the appointing
authority for a period which is generally regarded as nine
months provided that there was no eligible list and in this
case, the answer of the City of New York shows that there was
an eligible list established but in this case the appellees
of
were terminated not because/the existence of the eligible
list, but because of the existence of this statute, the City
of New York found that they were not citizens.
The Civil Service system in New York, as this
Court knows, is based on the merit system and the competitive
tests which is established after examination and qualifications.
One who is appointed after examination, obtains rights of
tenure, seniority and promotional preferences together with
pension benefits.
The appellees have been residents according to their
affidavit — have been residents in the City of New York for
varying years, some six years, some 10 years and none of them
have taken even the first step to obtain citizenship.
The first Appellee, IlcDougall, for instance, was a
resident of the City of New York since 1964 and never took
any steps to become a citizen.
None of the appellees, because of a question of

5
preemption — which will be discussed — none of the appellees
xvere ever certified by the United States Secretary of Labor
for the position he or she was filling.

As a matter of fact,

McDougall v;as the only one that took an examination.

And let

me point out that prior to 1968, the statute which I read
provided that nobody could take an examination for a position,
but that was altered and amended to provide that on one could
be appointed, the difference being that one who was an alien
could take the examination and in the meantime take steps to
become a citizen.
As a usual process, it takes from six months to a
year before the examinations are marked and a list established
and a list, when established, is usually good for varying
periods of three to five years.
The district court in thi3 case sustained the
appellees’ challenge on both equal protection and supremacy
clause grounds, relying principally on the case decided by
this court, Graham against Richardson, which we are sure was
misapplied.

The Graham case has spawned a flood of litigation

in various federal courts throughout the land.

According to

our computation, there are seven cases in various federal
courts in various stages of litigation, raising questions as
to the validity of discrimination against aliens.
Let me also point out that the Federal Government
has equivalent practice which is as a result of authority

6
given to the Civil Service Commission to establish the
conditions of employment and, by Executive Order, aliens have
been barred from United States’ employment except in the same
way as New York does, certification where there is no
available employee.
In addition to that, Congress, In the annual
ap propriation bills, has specifically provided that no payment
of compensation can be made to an employee if he is not a
citizen of the United States.

That Is, an employee on

American soil.
A copy of the federal provisions we have attached
to our brief as exhibit one.
In this court here, the appellees have persisted In
the claim that the right to travel of the aliens is being
interfered with, as if they ever possessed such right, which
is involved in this case and they have apparently, as we
read their briefs, argued that the statute is over-broad,
which was not a contention that was made below, in the sense
that the lower grade of employees should not be barred by this
statutory provision but the higher grade employees may be
barred.
The first question that suggests itself is whether
there is any question of equal protection available to the
appellees; whether the court was right in considering equal
protection at all.

7
We suggest that history, precedent and principle
require this Court to hold that the states have not been
divested of the power to limit its public employees to
citizens and that this power is not affected by the equal
protection clause of the Constitution.
This does not involve the consideration of the
question of rights or privileges which is being blurred by the
decisions of this Court as a question of any entitlement at
all to consideration for employment, public employment.
The question was under considerati o

in the Crane

against United States and in that case the — this court
held valid the New York State statute which provided at that
time that employment on public contracts could be limited
to citizens and the question

that disturbed the court in the

discussion was the question not whether public employment
could be limited to citizens but as to whether the public
contractors were in effect the government when engaged in
public contracts.
The district court relied to some extent on the
Truax case which was decided by the same court at the same
time and in the same volume of the reports.

In the Truax

?
case, the court stripped down an Arizona statute that forbid
the employment of aliens generally.

,

At the same time, it was very careful to point out
in its opinion that it did not — that that case did not

8
involve the employment of citizens in public employment and
in the Crane case on the question of equal protection, the
court concluded with the words, "There is added to view that
a distinction between aliens and citizens violates the
principle of classification." We think this is also without
foundation and in the Truax case, Chief Justice Hughes said
that the challenge here is not limited to persons who are
engaged in public work but that it bars from employment in
the entire field of industry in all common occupations.
The C^ahe case came from the New York Court of
Appeals and Judge Cardoza, who later sat on this court,
distinguished the Truax situation and the Crane situation in
this way.

It must be evident that nothing in this opinion

here gives confidence to the view that the government may
deny to aliens the right to engage in any private trade or
calling on terms of equality with citizens.

It is true that

in dealings between man and man, the alien and the citizen
trade labor on equal terms.

It is the denial of equal

protection laws when the government, in its capacity as law­
maker, regulating not its own property but private business,
bars the alien from the right to trade and labor.
It is therefore our contention that the Crane case,
in Its present — under the facts in this case — Is authori­
tative disposition by this Court for the view that the
equal protection clause does not apply.

9
Q

You mean the equal protection clause does not

apply to state employees?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

It does not apply to aliens

seeking to obtain public employment.
Q

But you do not take the position that the

state is out from under the 14th Amendment when it hires its
own employees?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

The equal protection clause of

course is applicable to the state.
But on the question of whether aliens are entitled
to public employment, it is our first position that the
equal protection clause does not apply because of the 10th
Amendment to the Constitution.

When the Constitution was

adopted, in historic times, the states were obtained and
continued with the right to run their own government
except insofar as expressly interfered with by the United
States Constitution, and there is nothing in the United
States Constitution and it would appear to me to do violence
to the government of the states or either by judicial decree
or by Congressional Act, to interfere with the government of
the states and to provide that aliens must be employed by the
state.

Now, this is not a novel — in Oregon against Mitchell,

Chief Justive Black in discussing the 18-year-old vote case
said, in part, "It cannot be successfully argued that the l^th
Amendment was intended to strip the states of their power

10
carefully preserved In the original Constitution to govern
themselves."

The 14th Amendment was surely not intended to

make every discrimination between groups of people a
constitutional denial of equal protection.
And in Maryland against Wirtz, Mr. Justice Douglas
said, in connection with the bill which — a law which, as
this Court will remember dealt with minimum wages of certain
classes of state employees — Mr. Justice Douglas said in his
dissent that it would snuff out state sovereignty if all this
can be done, then the national government could devour the
essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is
attested by the 10th Amendment, and then he went on to quote
Mr. Justice Stone in the case, New York against United States
where Chief Justice Stone said, "The national government may
not interfere unduly with the state's performance of its
sovereign functions of government.

It may not impair the

state’s functions of government."
Now, below, the three-judge court In its opinion
disregarded the fact that the — that this country and its
various subdivisions is not only a government of the people,
it Is a government by the people and "by the people" means
the citizens of this land and this includes — this excludes
the right to compel aliens to be employed by the state or its
subdivisions.
Q

Mr. Hirshowitz, are you going to come to the

11
case of Graham against Richardson, which I guess the threejudge district court below relied on?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

Yes •— yes, Graham against

Richardson ~ did not involve any practice in New York.

New

York, as the papers show, has paid welfare to aliens from the
beginning of the welfare system.
As we read the Graham case, this court was dealing
with indigents and in that case there the state involved was
trying to establish a crude economic preference.

The citizen

was being provided with the necessities of life while the
alien was not, although the alien — although alien status
bears absolutely no relationship to the aliens’ needs as a
recipient or to his contributions as a taxpayer.

In contrast

to welfare, Section 53, the statute under discussion, it is
concerned soley with maintaining the national character and
the integrity and efficiency of the career Civil Service.
Now, even If this court holds that equal protection
was properly made an issue below, it

i3

our position that the

right of the state to run its government by its own citizens
by itself furnishes sufficient basis whatever test of equal
protection is applicable.
All nations and states conduct their affairs
through the agency of public employees and thus practically
every nation and state requires its agents, including the
career civil servant, be citizens.

As this Court recognized

12
in such cases as Afroyim against Rusk, citizens, not aliens,
are members of state.
Q

Mr. Hirshowitz, what do you — how do you

define a term that you have employed, "career Civil Service?"
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

There are — there are three grades

of employment under New York State Civil Service and I think
it is generally the rule.

You have the competitive class

where appointments are made after examination and then there
is the exempt class, exempt category where appointments may
be made by the appointing officer without regard to exam­
inations and then there is the noncompetitive class where
there's a position of unusual character but which examination
cannot provide the suitable employee.
Q

Well, now, in New York City, is trash

collected by the city?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
Q

It is for residents, yes.

And is the statute one that would require

then the municipally-employed trash collector to be a citizen
of the United States?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

Every employee of the city must be

a citizen unless, as I said, coming within the exceptions of
certification and incidentally they have only been, in the
City of New York there have been only 27 certifications of
waiver of this citizenship requirement.
any difference.

But it doesn’t make

I think in the Mitchell case this court said

13
it was difficult — almost impossible to draw a distinction
betitreen various grades of employees.

The clerk

that is in

the village office and takes your tax receipts as far as the
public is concerned, he or she is government and we are
entitled to insist that such employees be citizens of the
United States.
In addition to which the career employee who starts
at the bottom level under the merit system in New York is
entitled to promotion and the same person who starts at the
bottom level as the garage collector — the garbage
collector — will be entitled to take an examination and be
appointed to the senior position up to the top positions,
up to the top.

There is no way of stopping that.

It has

been suggested by our opposition, as I said towards the
beginning, that maybe the bottom garbage eollect-or, as far as
he is concerned, the law is bad.

But that promotion

opportunities should be precluded for aliens.

Well, that

would be in violation of the whole Civil Service system.

in effect, a characterization of the court's opinion
generally?

When he says, "Nothing in our decision should be

construed to mean that a sate may not lawfully maintain a
citizenship requirement for those positions where citizenship
bears some rational relationship to the specific demands of
a particular position."

Do you feel the other judges concur

14
in that statement?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
did.

I don't know.

I don’t think they

Lombard — Judge Lombard was troubled by the decision.

As I have indicated there, he was troubled by the fact that
there are many positions on the higher level in the Civil
Service system that he himself conceded should be kept only
for citizens and he finally rationalized that, but that
wouldn’t mean if you follow Judge Lombard you would have to
in each individual case Justify the preclusion of aliens.
I x*ant to say a word about preemption.
The second ground upon which the district court
relied for its decision was the question of preemption.

Now,

that was discussed in the Graham case also, but let me point
out that none of the appellees were ever certified by the
United States Secretary of Labor for these particular
positions, so that the claim that the certification by United
States Secretary of Labor somehow interfered with the validity
of the statute has no basis in fact.
The Secretary of Labor certifies all immigrants
only upon entrance pursuant to the statute.

These

certifications do not purport to cover public employment at
all and I have read the minutes of the Congressional hearings,
both with reference to the 1952 law and the revision in 1965
and nowhere is there any indication that Congress intended
by the law to cover public employment.

15
We think that the statute is entitled to the pre­
sumption of constitutionality that was accorded to the
Congressional Act in the Oregon against Mitchell ease and we
submit that the Civil Service employee who is an alien
would present special problems to the state and to the
Federal Government.
In Rogers against Bellel, which was recently
decided by this court, this court referred to the problems
that arise from dual nationalities there and referred to a
case by Mr. Justice Douglas in which he said "One who has a
dual nationality would be subject to claims from both
nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting,
that circumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality
to do acts which would not be compatible with the obligations
of American citizenship.
Q

Does that apply to the trash collector?

MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

It does, your Honor.

It applies

to anyone.
Q

He would have a dual citizenship problem?

MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

Not so long ago in Laner against

Casey, this court held that —
Q

What problem would he have?

What problem

would the trash collector have?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

The trash collector could create

as much problems as the conductor in Laner against Casey

16
where this Court held that a subway conductor was obligated
to fill out a loyalty oath.
Q

Where do you stop when you —

At Truax against Raich, that’s where you

stop.
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

No, Truax against Raich merely

held, as I have pointed out, it applies to persons in common
occupations and as I indicated —
Q

Do you say that the State of New York could

not pass a law prohibiting the employment of aliens by any­
body?

They couldn’t pass that law?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
Q

No, sir.

But they could pass a law that we will not

employ aliens in our state government?
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

And you don’t see any problem?

MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

No problem at all because it is

the — that is the way this country runs there.

This

country could not be run by aliens in ad&tion to which,
Mr. Justice Marshall —
Q

I'd say this country could exist if every

trash collector in New York was alien.

I think this

country could exist.
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:
Q

Any case —

That is just ray personal view.

MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

Yes.

In any case, you can pick

17
out random situations, but the fact is that all employees
should be citizens and it doesn’t
from employment.

present any bar to them

These people here who have been in New

York City at least six to ten years made no effort to become
citizens there.

It is no bar to them, whether it is trash

collectors or whether, in this case, McDougall was a senior,
had a senior job post in the poverty program.
let me also say, Mr. Justice Marshall, that the
State of New York and the City of New York is now engaged in
trying to reevaluate the merit system in order to provide a
better means of testing the entrance of a million and a half
Puerto Ricans and about two million black citizens in the
competitive class system.
Q

Thank you for eventually getting around to It.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Hr. Hirshowitz.

Me. Evens.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LESTER EVENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. EVENS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I really, frankly, don’t know where to begin.

I

was extremely troubled by the brief submitted by the
appellants and, frankly, very troubled by the argument today.
There are references that are made — apparently
made by the appellees that state that we would not object

18
if certain jobs were eliminated and others were included.

I

don’t recall ever making any such statement and if I had, I
certainly would take this opportunity to clarify the point
that v/e certainly consider this the most rank form of
classification in violation of the equal protection clause
that
and/it would apply across the board regardless of the
positions involved.
When I attempted to read the brief of the
appellents — and, frankly, I had a great deal of difficulty
in doing so.
Q

Do I understand by your opening statement

that you, therefore, disagree with the concurring opinion
in this case?
MR. EVENS:

Yes, I do.

I do, quite clearly.

I

think that without any characterization about Judge Lombard’s
decision, I do think that his opening paragraph essentially
recited or restated the law as it should be and was in
concurrence with the opinion that was written and then
seemed to have diluted it or vitiated the impact of the
original decision without any basic justification.
If I may point out, as Mr. Hirshowitz has indicated,
the New York State Civil Service statute is broken

down

into two major categories, the classified and the unclassified.
Included in the unclassified are elective offices from the
governor through the legislators.

It also Includes a number

19
of other very essentially Important positions, such as heads
of departments and appointments made directly by the
Governor, either with or without the consent of the state
senate.
Any discussions about positions of policy or having
an essential impact upon the running of the government of the
state certainly would seem to fall primarily within this
class and yet, this very class makes no reference to
citizenship whatsoever.
Q

What, the elective?

MR. EVENS:

What

I am saying is, it includes

elective plus heads of departments and appointments —
Q

The Governor of New York?

MR. EVENS;
appointments and it

— by the Governor directly, executive
includes appointments by the legislature

for various jobs.
Q

So far as the law of New York goes, the

Governor of New York could be a citizen of —
MR. EVENS;
Q

Must be a citizen.

— could be a citizen of Japan, could he?

MR. EVENS:

No, he is required to be a citizen

under the Constitution.

I am referring specifically to the

Constitution of the State of New York requires all those in
elective office to be
Q

citizens of the United States.

Everybody in elective office?

20

MR. EVENS:
Q

At every level?

MR. EVENS:
Q

At every level.

To be a citizen of the United States —

MR. EVENS:
Q

In elective office.

Of the United States.

— and of the State of New York?

MR. EVENS:

And of the State of New York, residency

of the State of New York in varying degrees depending upon
the position involved, but for the Governor, the requirement
is the longest.
Q

But none can be a resident alien?

MR. EVENS:

None can be a resident alien under the

Constitution of the State of New York.

However, under the

unclassified designation within the Civil Service statute,
there are a number of other positions enunciated in that
statute other than elective office.
They enunciate heads of various departments.

They

enunciate appointments by the Governor directly either with or
without the consent of the Senate to positions that the
Governor would appoint to in running the executive branch of
the government.
They refer to certain positions appointed by the
legislature itself.

Now, it would seem to me that if issues

of policy and loyalty and of that nature would be Involved,
it would clearly be the people that would have these very

21
responsible positions both with the executive branch of the
state and the legislative branch and, particularly, heads of
departments, yet -— I’m sorry —

Q

Well, may the state exclude aliens from

running for office in New York?
MR. EVENS:

It would seem to me quite clearly under

the Constitution of the State of New York that you are
required to be a citizen, Justice.
Q

Well, I know that is what the State

Constituion would have.

How about the validity of that

division under the equal protection clause?
MR. EVENS:

My personal attitude Is that I have

difficulty with that, that I think that —
Q

How about aliens voting?

MR. EVENS:

I think that aliens certainly should

have the right to vote, certainly aliens —
Q

They don’t have the right to vote?

MR. EVENS:

They do not have the right to vote in

New York State.
Q

And assume those provisions for voting and

for running for office are valid under the equal protection
clause, does that make your case any tougher?
MR. EVENS:

No, I really do not think so because I

think that, again, to refer back to the brief of the
appellenats in this proceeding, I think there was a confusion

22
concerning the elements necessary under the equal protection
clause.

It is my understanding that it is essential — there

are essentially two basic sections to the equal protection
clause9 the traditional one for which there can be an
application of a rational relationship, the other being any
classification which might be based on race, which would be
an invidious classification which would require very strict
judicial review and —•
Q

Do you find that in the language of the

14th Amendment, Mr. Evens?
MR. EVENS:

No, I find that in the cases and I

refer specifically, the most recent case being Graham versus
Richardson and I would like to point out that I believe that
the equal protection argument was raised in Lindsay versus
Normet

and in that case, I believe Mr. Justice White had

stated that a reasonable application of a summary kind of
proceeding in which the parties were limited in terms of the
kinds of defenses they could raise was very rational and rea­
sonable because the statute was intended to overcome the
consequences which were much more dire, yet nevertheless there
was an issue of due process that could have been involved in
that proceeding and sustained the statute
Q

in Oregon.

Let’s assume that the requirement that a

person be a citizen to vote is valid under the equal
protection clause.

23
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

And the justification is that you do not

want the political apparatus to be in control of aliens.

Or

don't want aliens to participate in governmental decision­
making.

Now, is it such a long step to say that they also

shouldn't be able to work for the state?

To participate

in the administrating of the state business?
MR. EVENS:
Q

The initial position —

Uou might even say that a fortiori they

shouldn't be entitled to it.
MR. EVENS:

Except if I may just point out, we

are here challenging Section 53 of the New York State Civil
Service statute.

Section 53 is the merit section, the

competitive section of the Civil Service statute.

As I

tried to point out earlier, there are various sections
within the Civil Service statute which involved, in fact,
very important policy positions in which there axe no
restrictions concerning citizenship and in fact the Governor
could appoint aides and people who would assist him in
making very important policy decisions of the state and there
would have to be no regard, there need not be any regard as
to the issue of citizenship.
Q

That is a matter of choice by the state, is

it not?
MR. EVENS:

Pardon?

24

Q

That is a matter of choice by the state.

MR. EVENS:

Or by the executive who has this,

certainly that prerogative to exercise.
Q

We are talking about the compulsion

of

the l4th Amendment.
MR. EVENS:

However, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

that is relevant to exactly the issue that is involved here.
The state is endeavoring, by the statute, to legislate the
elimination of an entire class from public employment with
an apparatus where if there was a foundation or a basis for
determining that certain individuals were not competent to
hold jobs, perhaps an alien coming to this country holding a
publioly-elected office.
But certainly the Civil Service Commission is more
than competent to deal with this.

This would not require

the kind of legislative situation that an elective office
might require.
Q

What about the federal statute that has been

reproduced at page 40 of the — your friend's brief?

What

do you have to say about the constitutionality of that
statute?
MR. EVENS:

Is that the statute that was recently

amended in 1970 or 1971?
Q

It Is 1972, It would appear.

MR. EVENS:

1972.

I believe that that is the

25
statute that may have been involved ultimately in the matter
of Jalll versus Hampton

in which this court denied a writ of

certiorari, I think that it would equally apply to this
statute as it would to the state —
Q

You think this federal statute is

unconstitutional?
MR. EVENS:
Q
thing more.

Yes, your Honor, I do.

Mr. Evens, let me follow through with one
I take it from your answer to Justice White

that you were troubled by the provisions of the New York
Constitution requiring that elective office holders be
citizens, troubled in the light of the 14th Amendment?
MR. EVENS:

Yes, your Honor, I am troubled in terms

of the broad scope of the exclusion.

To analagously recite

the requirements of the Immigration and Naturalization Law,
which sets forth very particular detail regarding political
affiliations and character and so forth, I think that does
not disturb me as being violative of the equal protection
clause, but I do think that with regard to just generally
and broadly saying that an entire class of people should not
be permitted to hold office in and of itself, out of any
particular context, does disturb me.
Q

Well, now, in the Federal Consstitution, we

have citizenship requirements —
MR. EVENS:

Yes.

26
Q

— for the President and members of the

Congress, both Senate and House.
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes, Senate and House.

Are you equally troubled by those provisions

in the light of the more, the later enacted 14 th Amendment?
MR, EVENS:

Well, in that situation I would have to

respond, and I don’t mean to be evasive, that I don’t see
the mechanism or the device to do anything concerning that
other than the method of repeal.

I do think that this court

could review the Constitution of the State of New York.
I think that perhaps — essentially what I am
trying to say, Mr. Justice Blackman, is that the traditional
classical roles of citizenship seem to be changing and
perhaps changing for the better and I do think that con­
ceivably if such a matter could be approved by the citizenry
of the United States, it might want to change.

I don't see

the apparatus beyond repeal that could in any way change the
United States' Constitution.
Q

Would you be relying on the 14th Amendment to

repeal the provision that the President of the United States
must be a native-born American citizen?
MR. EVENS:
Q

Well, I have — I must confess that —

When you start down that road, suppose a

citizen of Venezuela who came up here and liked the country
but wanted to keep his citizenship in Venezuela filed for

27
President of the United States and the issue might arise when
he was trying to run in the state primarys let us say; now,
then, on your theory, the 14th Amendment

could be read as

having repealed.
MR. EVENS:

If I may, it is my position that I am

endeavoring to take in this is that there are other
qualifications that can be imposed that a

mere broad

classification involving alienage raises very, very serious
questions.
I think that the brief of the appellants in and
of itself, their arguments, seem to substantiate that this is
essentially a discriminatory device.
I would like to, in response to what you are saying,
I'd like to point out — Mr.

Dougall's name was mentioned

that he had come here in 1964 and never made any effort to
become a citizen of the United States.

He came here as an expatriot, as,

essentially, a political refugee.

Mr. Dougall came here

As long as the government

Guiana never changes, Mr. Dougall has no

intentions whatsoever of returning to British Guiana.
However, Mr. Dougall Has made it very clear that if
there is a change in government that would make it possible
for him to return, he would at that time return.
Nevertheless, he has been and continues to be, a

other things, in fact has a family and children and, quite
incidentally, his children have been born in the United
States because he has been married since he has been here.
Q

Does he want to keep his options open?

MR. EVENS:

No, no, your Honor, he has never said

he wanted to keep his options open.

He has clearly said,

"I always wnat to return to British Guiana but I cannot
return to the government that is there now because it is
that very government that has been so hostile to me that I
have been forced to leave."
I should point out that two of the other named
plaintiffs in this proceeding are refugees from Cuba.

Now, incidentally, one of them has applied for
American citizenship.

All three of the named women plaintiffs

are all around the age of 21 or slightly older and one of
them has definitely — one of the Cuban citizens has applied
for citizenship.

The other has not.

know.

the argument or have their cake and eat it.

very few options.

But certainly

they should have the right and the prerogative to decide
where they wish to be citizens.
Q

On your theory, you have just told us, I

thought, that they should be entitled to vote —
MB. EVENS:
Q

— and be entitled to run for public office.

MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

Isn't that keeping options open?

MR. EVENS:

It may keep options open, but I certainly

do not think that It is necessarily their intention to keep
these options open.

going to try and get the best of all possible worlds, that

to vote — in your view

Would you say he was entitled

by an absentee ballot?

30

MR. EVENS:
Q

I would again say that this person —

Is there a difference between a resident and

a nonresident alien, on your theory?
MR. EVENS:

I — I — there is a distinction

between a resident and a nonresident alien.
Q

On your theory?

MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

I know there is in law, but what Is your

theory of the difference?
MR. EVENS:

Our theory has been that the resident

aliens involved, the named plaintiffs and the class they
represent in this proceeding are people who are participating
as viable members of the State of New York, have lived there
legally and lawfully, have designated New York as their
*

residence and that they should have the right and the
entitlement to participate in all of the activities of
that state, including the right to not have doors of
employment closed.

Now, if Mr. Dougall —

i

Q

Is there anything that you can think of, any

right that a citizen oould possibly have that you wouldn’t
urge that an alien would also have?
MR. EVENS:
answer that question.
Q

It would be very difficult for me to
I carft see —

Then pray tell, what is the benefit of

American citizenship?

31
MR. EVENS:

Well, the benefit of American citizen­

ship, for one, essentially, is set forth a political benefit.
If I may say —
Q

Political?

I thought I thought you said they

should havethe right to politic?
MR. EVENS:

What I am saying — what I am saying Is

that this is a country that has granted refuge to political
refugees and the — well, let me withdraw that.
I would respond in a sense by answering the
question, does citizenship require any special benefit?
I have trouble with that.

And

I don't think that citizenship

necessarily confers —
Q

If I follow your position to the bitter end,

then we didn't need the l4th Amendment.
MR. EVENS:

If people were not discriminated

against and If their equal protection rights were not
violated.
Q

The 14th Amendment gives citizenship to people,

so you did need that.

You did need a grant of citizenship In

this country.
MR. EVENS:

It was my understanding, yes, but from

my understanding of the 14th Amendment says that we will—
Q

I think it is marvelous how far you go away

from the issue that is in this case.
MR. EVENS:

Well, I do not intend to go away from

32

the issue of this case.

It is my intention to spell out

that on questions of employment that the state cannot justify
in any way any petition, nor have they, that in any way could
not be

performed by a lawful resident alien of the state

as — than by anyone else.
Now, if I am asked questions such as "Should aliens
be allowed to be on petit or grand juries,"which they are
not allowed to be in the State of New York, or "Should
they be allowed to vote?"

or "Should they be allowed to

hold public office?" these are highly hypothetical questions
which are very difficult for me to answer because it means
that I must take a position which is really quite removed
from the case before us.
These situations do exist.
differences where it is applicable.

There are obviously
I think, however, that

the cases have clearly Indicated — and it was clearly pointed
out

Shapiro v. Thompson and in Graham versus Richardson

that when there is a classification that discriminates
against aliens, it is tantmount to discriminating against a
class because of race and if we were to make rules that black
people from the south coming to New York could or could not
do things simply because they were black and from the south,
that would be objectionable and I believe totally unconsti­
tutional, if there are any such statutes enacted.
Q

Would it make any difference what their race

33
was if they were coming from the south to the north?
MR. EVENS:
Q

Well —

If they were people here?

MR. EVENS:

If they came from — if they came from

adjoining states of Connecticut and New Jersey or Pennsylvania.
If they were black and the statute said that blacks could not
be Civil Service employees because they were unstable and
because they are disloyal or they have loyalty to the state
that they came from, this would be unquestionably —
Q

Of course, that doesn't have anything to do

with this case, does it?
MR. EVENS:
fication

It does in the sense that the classi­

concerning aliens is tantamount to a classification

concerning race.
Q

Where did this Court ever say that?

MR. EVENS:

It is my understanding that that is

exactly what the Court said in Graham v. Richardson —
Q

For purposes of —

Q

Pardon me.

MR. EVENS:

For purposes of the degree of Judicial

scrutiny on the equal protection clause.
Q

It said these are suspect olasses —

MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

— which is nothing more or less — as I

think Chief Justice Warren said — that we scrutinize the

34
line drawing and the basis of the classification very
carefully.
MR. EVENS:

Yes, more particularly than if it would

be a matter not of race.
Q

One factual distinction, Mr. Evans, is that

your clients presumably have it within their own power to
change their status, don’t they, to become citizens?
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes, they do.

If they so choose.

MR. EVENS:

All of my clients are now over the age

of 21 and could qualify to become citizens.

There are

questions of whether or nottiiey choose to take that option,
and as I pointed out, some of them really are here as
political refugees.

They fully intend to return.

It should be pointed out, too, incidentally, that
these people were wmployed by the City of New York and were
fired.

These people were not seeking positions and when they

were employed by the City of New York, they were informed
that they would maintain the status that they always had
before.

They worked for a nonprofit corporation which
«
happened to have been funded by the Office of Economic
Opportunity and the Office

of Economic Opportunity cut off

the funding for the particular positions that they were
working in and the City of New York said, we will Incorporate
this now into one of the departments within the City of

35
New York and you will be permitted to continue to work and
you will be permitted to continue to maintain the same
position you have at the very same salary.

And very shortly

thereafter they were informed by letter that the only
reason they were being fired was because of their citizenship
and not because of any questions of competence or character
or anything else.
Now, it was pointed out by my adversary during
argument that the prevailing law today concerning public
employment is Crane and Heim and he cited Mr. Justice
Blackmun’s decision in Graham v. Richardson as sustaining
this position.
It was my understanding In reading that decision
that what the Court said Iss "We are not dealing with the
issue of employment and public employment at this time.

We

are dealing with an issue of welfare benefits."
As Judge Tenney in the district court In writing
the opinion in this case below stated, "The time has arrived.
The Dougall case has now presented that time where the issue
of employment has now come up concerning aliens and that it
is very appropriate to review that and in light of the
decision in Graham v. Richardson, this is a classification
that requires strict judicial scrutiny and the appellants in
this proceeding have not sustained or met that requirement."

Q

Would you think, Mr. Evens, or what would you

36
think if the statute of the State of New York had a limitation
to the employment of people in these categories who had
signified their intention to become citizens by having filed
the first application?

Do you think that would equally violate

the 14th Amendment?
MR. EVENS:
Q

If that

requirement were in there?

Yes.

MR. EVENS:

I — I — incidentally, there Is a

statute that does — I believe the second half of 53 that we
have before us has some such reference to it, the filing of
declaration of intent to become a citizen.
I personally — I have trouble with it if the
reason the State of New York has set forth this classification
It was for an unconstitutional reason and I believe it was
for an unconstitutional reason.

It was discriminating

against a class and I would like to point out that in the
brief of the appellants in this proceeding, they indicate
that aliens are unstable.
instability.

There is no evidence of their

They indicate that even if an alien took an

oath, as might be required of Civil Service employees, we
wouldn't necessarily believe them anyway.
Q

We haven't found on any of the reasons that

are argued.
MR. EVENS:
Q

No, I understand that.

The three-judge court didn't rest on any

37
such laws.
MR. EVENS:

No, it didn't, but the reason that I

point this out is that even using a close judicial examination,
what was the purpose of the legislation really does not
permit the statute to survive the requirements of the equal
protection clause and that the examples for the arguments
made by the appellants are themselves invidious.

The

implication —
Q

Mr. Evens, one of the fact situations that

you describe is that of Mr. Dougall, who plans, if the
government changes in

Guiana, to return.

Nov/, isn’t there

at least something that might commend itself to a reasonable
legislature in the argument that here is a man whom we can
provide a good job for in the Civil Service who we could
expect to

be there rather

indefinitely if we kept promoting

him if he were a national, but this man is subject to a,
you know, in his eyes, very legitimate outside pull that a
citizen just wouldn’t be subject to?
MR. EVENS:

However — however, I am not so sure

that a citizen might not be subject to it.

I think that

today —
Q

Don’t be silly.

No citizen is going back to

MR. EVENS:
New Jersey,

No, but a citizen might go back to

or to Washington, D. C.

There is certainly no

38
requirement to be a resident of the State of New York.
Q

No5 but most people haven’t left New Jersey

or Connecticut to come to New York as political refugees.
MR. EVENS:

No, no, but they certainly have come to

New York to get employment,/probably the focal point of
employment for the northeast area or perhaps even for the
country and that, in fact, we live in a society inhere our
population is very mobile and to make any kind of argument to
say that aliens are more unstable than the rest of the
population, without any foundation
specious argument.

or basis for it is a

It — it — a young person

graduates

from school, as is so typical, and comes to Washington, D. C.
or comes to the city of New York to seek employment and
perhaps to develop something in a career and never fully
intending to stay permanently.

Should that person be denied

the right to Civil Service employment, presuming that it is
a person born and living outside the State of New York who
is a citizen of the United States?
The statute does not discriminate against that
person nor do, I think, it should.

And I cannot see any

distinction between nonresidents of the State of New York
in terms of the arguments that the appellants make and aliens
who are lawful residents.

The very people that we are talking

about as the named plaintiffs in this proceeding admittedly
have been living here for a substantial period of time,

39
doing all of those things.

All of them have worked.

They

haven’t been themselves indigent or forced to seek other
forms of sustaining themselves.

They have been working

people.
Q

I recall that you do make a distinction

between resident and nonresident aliens.
MR. EVENS:

Yes.

Yes, and as a matter of fact.

Judge Tenney, I believe, Judged as well when he wrote the
opinion of the court below.
Q

You accept that?

MR. EVENS:

Yes, because I do believe that we

have many, many categories of aliens.

People come here on

short-term visas as tourists and I certainly don't think
that they would certainly be entitled to the kinds of
prerogatives that a citizen or a resident alien would be
entitled to.
The requirements imposed by the Immigration and
Naturalization Act are much more stringent than they are for
someone who comes here to take advantage of our — the
marvelous country, its natural resources, visiting the parks,
et cetera and leave within a short time.
Q

Should the state or the national government

exclude aliens, exclude your clients from military service?
Disqualify them from serving in the Army?
MR. EVENS:

Under the present law?

Oh, could they

40

enact a law saying aliens —
Q

Just say that they are just disqualified

from working for the government in the military services.
MR. EVENS:
Civil Service statute.

Well, it sounds very similar to a
You know, my approach to military —

the military service has always been the fact that aliens
are required to serve.
Q

I agree with you.

MR. EVENS:

And now using it from the other point of

view, X would have to presume that to be a form of government
employment or public employment.
Q

Exactly, it is.

MR. EVENS:

And, therefore, I think it would be

equally objectionable.
Q

And just right across the board, as far as

government employment is concerned?
MR. EVENS:

Provided — provided —• as long as the

statutes of the State of New York say that the person
closest to the Governor, the closest advisor to the
Governor need not be a citizen and certainly nobody else
should have to be required to be a citizen and the statute in
effect says that.
Q

So your position is limited to the peculiar­

ities of the New York law?

If the New York law didn’t have

those exceptions in it, would you still be here?

41
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

I would.

So it really doesn’t make much difference

about the Governor’s —
MR. EVENS:

No, I am just trying to point out the

anomalies in the argument of the appellant, that how can they
argue — how can they argue the necessity for making policy
decisions by someone who on the one hand — to use the
analogy the court has used today of the garbage collector, or
the analogy on the other hand, a biologist who happens to be
vrorking with fungus on, let’s say, tobacco leaves or whatever.
Q

Can you imagine a governor of a state in this

country today appointing somebody to high government office
who wasn’t a voter?
MR. EVENS:
Q

Who is not a citizen?

No, was not a voter was my case.

MR. EVENS:

He’d appoint him to high government

office?
Q
MR.
Q

Yes, sir.
EVENS:

Who is not a voter?

Yes, sir.

MR. EVENS:

Do you mean an office such as to fill

a vacancy on the bench or to fill —
Q

Any.

MR. EVENS:

He eeuld not, to fill a

vacancy on

the bench or could not to fill a vacancy in the legislature.
Q

You said there were some high positions that

the government could appoint an alien to?
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

And I am asking you, will you name me the

position that any governor would appoint a nonvoter to?
MR. EVENS:

I know no governor who would do that.

There are many other reasons.
him to.

I’m saying the statutes allow

That is all I am saying.
Thank you very much.
Q

Would your constitutional objections to this

statute disappear, then, if the statute said that this could
be waived under certain circumstances?
MR. EVENS:

The — the — my objection is to the

classification and it would exist regardless to what
modifications there might be by legislation.

I think that

this is an intent and an endeavor to take a large segment
of the population of the State of New York and to say to
those people, you cannot work in certain jobs.
Q

Well, all New York has said about these

governor’s aides that — the hypothetical people you are
talking about —
MR. EVENS:
Q

Yes.

— are that the Governor may appoint someone

43
if he wants to.
MR. EVENS;
Q

Yes.

Now, what if in the Civil Service they said

that the head of the agency may appoint some aliens who
rank in the first degree of Civil Service, if they want to?
Wouldn’t that be the same situation?
MR. EVENS;

I have some difficulty with that

because I think that once we get into qualifications in
making divisions, then we are no longer performing a
judicial funcitton.

We are — apparently are performing an

administrative or executive function or legislative function
which can very well be handled by a very, very sophisticated
and substantial body, the Commissioner, and his department,
of Civil Service.

And that certainly he could set forth

reasonable criteria of any kind.
If I may point out, Mr. Chief Justice, this statute
was originally amended to exclude noncitizens in 1939.

The

statute had been on the books for many years before that
without any reference to it.
his

However, the Commissioner, on

own, had been discriminating against aliens and in

fact it was recommended that this particular law be passed,
the amendment requiring citizens to be in the competitive
Civil Service class

because the Commission had been doing

something all along which the legislature had not mandated.
Now, this was one of the letters that we found in

the bill jacket.
Now, it seems to me that if we had before us
today the 1939 law before it was amended, and the Commissioner
himself was discriminating broadly against an entire class,
we would be making the very same argument, whether it was
enacted or not.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Hlrshowitz.
The case is submitted.
next in

We will hear arguments

— oh, pardon me. Your time was entirely used, but

we allowed Mr. Evens a little extension.
*

I'll let you comment on that.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A HIRSHOWITZ, ESQ.
MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

With reference to the discussion

as to the appointments by the Governor, the Public Offices
Law requires all department heads to be citizens.
In the discussion with reference to the exempt
employees and the noncompetitive employees, while it is true
that the department head who makes the appointment has no
similar Civil Service restriction, I know of no alien that
has ever been appointed to any of those positions.
information appears In the record.

No such

In the Department of Law

we have about eight non-certified — non-competitive
employees.

None of them are aliens and of course we have

45
about 400 lawyers who are all citizens who are in the exempt
class so that the discussion as to non-competitive and the
exempt class — the

distinction between that and the

provision as to the competitive Civil Service is really
remote from the controversy.
One other point

My adversary has conceded that

the statutory provision passed in 1939 was merely a legisla­
tive declaration of a practice by the state Civil Service
Commission that went back many years.

Moreover, as a matter

of fact, in the City of New York, the practice by local law
went back to 1890, so it is not a new provision that was
passed, in 1939 and the practice in New York State, let me
say, is not'peculiar because there are at least 27 states
that have identical or substantially identical statutes and
at many localities in other states such as Miami which is a
subject of a federal law suit which has a similar statute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Hirshowitz.

The case is submitted.
(Thereupon, at 2:56 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.)
