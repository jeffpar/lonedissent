MR. STANKO:

THE PETITIONERS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The constitutional test for obscenity which is

11

applicable to the states through the

12

Fourteenth Amendments contains three parts,

which must exist separately

Richard Pope and Charles Morrison were both

tried under a State of Illinois statute which allowed

the views of

That Illinois obscenity statute is
unconstitutional in each and every possible application,

10

11

it’s a retailer, a distributor, a publisher, or, as in

12

this case, a

This statute has been

18

Subsequent to the convictions in this case,

19

Illinois passed a new obscenity statute.

20

the State of

I think it's instructive to note that the

21

obscenity statute put into place by the State of

22

Illinois legislature conforms precisely tc the

23

construction for which we argue in this case.

24
25

And explicity, it puts community standards
into the first element of the test, which is the

1

patently offensive part of the test.

2

It includes community standards in the second

3

element, which is the -- excuse me, the first is

4

prurient interest; the second is patently offensive.

5

And it omits community standards from the value

6

determination .

7

So what we have is the State of Illinois

8

arguing for a construction of the statute which is

9

really consistent -- inconsistent with what it has on

10

the books right now.

11

QUESTION-.

Well, Mr.

Stanko, I don't

12

understand your point when you say that the issue is

13

whether, you know, the majority can run roughshod over

14

-- it really isn't an issue of whether the majority can

15

or not.

16

Your complaint is

that it has to be the

17

majority that does it, and that you can't use community

18

standards.

19

You're perfectly willing to have literary

20

works banned because the majority considers that they

21

have no literary merit.

22

MR. STANKO:

23

QUESTION:

That's not true at all.
All you're insisting is that it be

24

a nationwide standard and not a community standard.

25

It's just a question of how big the majority has to be,

It might be expert testimony relating to the
work .

QUESTION;

And how would the judge charge the

jury?

8
9

It might be, such

MR. STANKO;

The judge would do more than

charge the jury that they are to determine if the work,

in Illinois,

under this statute, was utterly without

But he wouldn't say any — he

wouldn't have to say anything else that, you know, you

17

must give some consideration to the expert testimony and

the jury to use -- to evaluate the evidence using their

QUESTION;

judge?

HR. STANKO:

QUESTION;

Hr. Stanko, may I inquire whether

17

the petitioner offered any evidence that the materials

18

here had redeeming social value?

19

20

22
23

HR. STANKO;

There was no evidence offered in

either one of these cases, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Then how would the petitioner be

prejudiced here?
MR. STANKO;

Well, in each of these cases, an

24

attack was made on the validity of the statute, both as

25

written and construed.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

The attack was that the statute was

unconstitutional because it

law, to raise the constitutional issue.

QUESTION:

There's no

But you lost on that issue, and the

petitioner was tried and convicted.

10

NS. STANKO:

That's correct.

We lost -- the

11

statute was effectively construed by the trial judge to

12

include community standards

in the consideration.

So at that point to present evidence, unless

13
14

it was within the community itself, of value, would have

15

been nothing more than a useful ceremony.

16

But you didn’t even make an offer

of proof?

(202) 628-9300

MR. STANKO;

1

The phrasing of the instruction

2

allowed the jury to apply community standards, that's

3

correct, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. STANKO:

What instruction did you request?
In the Morrison case, there was a

6

specific instruction which included community standards

7

in the first two elements and excluded it from the third

8

element.
There was another instruction which would

9
10

have, by itself, advised the jury that they could

11

consider community standards only on the first two parts

12

of the test.
In the Pope case,

13

because of the construction

14

given by the trial court both in that case and in the

15

earlier Morrison case, there was no separate instruction

16

tendered by the defense relating to community standards.
The instruction was crafted along the

17
18

construction given by the trial court.
QUESTION;

19

I must say, you’ve sort of thrown

20

me off.

21

but I had thought you were seeking -- as I think the

22

Chief Justice thought — that you were seeking an

23

implicit instruction that the third part has to be

24

determined on the basis of national standards.

25

Because I -- it’s not your fault, I suppose,

But you're not.

All you want is the absence
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of an instruction that it be determined on the basis of

2

community standards?

3

MR. STANKO;

Well, the relief sought in each

4

case flows from a constitutional facial attack on the

5

statute.

6

And the facial attack is that the statute

7

allows community standards to come in on the third

8

elem en t.

9

Flowing from that

is the instruction issue

10

that as a result of that instruction, juries are being

11

instructed that community standards are to be applied to

12

all three elements.

13

We would be more than happy to not have a

14

specific instruction

15

to the first two elements, but just have an instruction

16

that lays out the elements of the test, put community

17

into the first two elements, leave it out of the third

18

element, and

19

consideration.

20

which says, you may only apply it

the jury has what it needs to make its

One of the promises of Miller was that the

21

First Amendment protects works which, taken as a whole,

22

have serious literary, artis„tic, political or scientific

23

value, regardless of whether the government, or

24

regardless of whether a majority of the people approve

25

of the ideas in that particular work.

14
15

Mr. Stanko, may I interrupt you on

Is it your view that the value determination
is a question of fact or a question of law?

16

MR. STANKO:

It*s a question of fact for the

decide.

asking, I guess, is, do you

it is on the first two elements?

I think it's broader cn the third

element, Your Honor, necessarily so.

21

community standards are applied to patently offensive or

22

to prurient interest, certainly an appellate court, in a

23

state that might have a countywide standard, or this

Court, is not going to be in a position tc know what the

25

community standards were.

Court.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Stanko , I was not being

13

entirely facetious when I said, you know, there may be

14

three categories.

15

You put it to us as though the question of

16

whether it is utterly without redeeming social value, or

17

under the modern test, whether it has any literary or

18

artistic merit, is simply a question of reality.

19

either does or doesn't.

It

25

It's no use arguing about

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

merit or not.

Some people will say it's wonderful;

other people will say it's terrible.
Now, I can understand how a jury or a court
can decide that matter on the basis of either local
community standards, that is, most of the people in this
community think it's a nice piece of art, or even
national standards, most of

the people nationally think

it's good art.
But I don’t see how a jury is to

abstract

itself from community standards and decide, as a matter
of fact, whether this is good art or not.
Isn’t that utterly unrealistic?

Aren’t you

really driven to telling the jury, either use local
standards or use national standards?
You can't tell them, as a matter of fact, is a
Campbell’s Soup can good art or not?
MR. STANKO;

There are many situations in

which something may have value, but only a minority of
people, but not to a majority of people.
If

you look at many of the works that were

held obscene years ago — Ulysses, God’s Little Acre -any number of things that state courts held obscene, you
will understand that the majority might dislike
something that ultimately does have value, does have
importance to someone.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. SALLY LOUISE DILGART, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. DILGART;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I'd like to supplement Petitioners' summary of

18

evidence in this case, because this record reveals that

19

petitioners were pandering sexually exclusive material

20

of the hard-core variety solely for its prurient appeal

21

and commercial gain.

22

These six magazines were purchased from two

23

adult bookstores in Rockford, Illinois, that advertised

24

magazines and marital aids for sale, and video films to

25

watch inside the stores.

Access to those stores was limited to adults

2

only, and there hundreds of

3

for sale inside those stores.

4

magazines just like these

Everone of the magazines was sexually

5

explicit, and the proprietors had even grouped the

6

magazines in categories, categories that advertised the

7

prurient appeal of the particular subject matter

8

involved .

9

The titles alone of these magazines revealed

10

that their extensive -- their exclusive purpose is to

11

appeal to prurient interest.

12

which you have before you today contains an

13

uninterrupted series of photographs depicting the same

14

kind of offensive hard-core sexual conduct described by

hard-core sexual conduct.

QUESTION:

7

Is it your view that in order to

decide this case we have to read these magazines?
MS. DILGART;

8

It’s been my understanding of

9

the Court's decisions in the past, Your Hcnor, under

10

appellate review, that the Court will undertake that

11

duty, and has a constitutional obligation to conduct a

12

review to make sure that the First Amendment has not

been violated in this case.

the record in that matter.

He wish to make two arguments.

such an instruction does indeed serve the First

may not be made in this manner, the petitioners*

And secondly, even if value determinations

22

treat value determinations in any other way.

23
24
25

So in submitting the case to the jury for

Jurors need a consistent frame of reference
when making these three determinations.
In these particular cases, the Pope and
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Morrison juries were instructed to discard their

2

personal opinions, to consider the views cf ordinary

3

adults within the whole State of Illinois.

4
5

We submit to you that that instruction was
constitutionally proper.

6

Jury determinations of value should be made

7

with reference to community standards.

And

I use the

8

term "community" in the sense that, by definition, it

9

will look, beyond the idiosyncratic opinion of a single

10

person to focus on common views held by a larger group

11

of people.
Juries were designed to bring a sense of

12
13

community to the law, and jurors perform their intended

14

function when they make judgments of this very sort.
Contrary to petitioners* claim, community

15
16

standards are, in a sense, objective, because they

17

prevent jurors from indulging their personal opinions or

18

tastes.

19

That does not mean that the First Amendment

20

requires any particular geographic designation of the

21

community, because I submit to you that decisions of

22

those nature are best left to the states.

23

Allow the states to decide the geographical

24

designations in a manner consistent with cur traditions

25

of local government, in matters of public welfare.

MS. DILGART:

2

It would be admissible as any

other sort of expert testimony.

4

critic in that case could not usurp the jury's function

5

and make the ultimate determination; but the juries

6

could consider that.
QUESTION!

7

The New York Times

What if the New York Times critic

8

said to the author, this is great stuff in New York and

east of the Hudson, but I know they wouldn’t like it in

10

Illinois.

It would be considered junk in Illinois.

11

Would his evidence be admissible or not?

12

MS. DILGART;

To the extent that a defendant

13

would seek to introduce evidence pertaining to a

14

community reaction outside the state standard employed,

15

no, it would not be admissible in that context.

Where is here, then, the Hamling approach?

community determinations can be reviewed, and that the

Or, that the courts are not necessarily

that jurors will not indulge their personal

16

And I would like to address some of the

Court's questions in the opening part of the argument,

18

and discuss the three possibilities for petitioners*

standards here as I see them .

20

First of all, I find reference within

22

It is my belief that if petitioners are asking this

25

objective test, then we would oppose any shorthand per

briefs to some sort of objective standard.

These simply are not susceptible to

There's no field guide to literature.

There is no Merck Manual for obscenity.

Nor should any per se test be adopted in

material may be pandered.

8
9

These matters, we believe, are best left to
the initial determination of a jury drawing on their own

10

knowledge, considering any expert testimony which may

11

have been admitted at trial, and with the safeguards of

12

the Miller case and appellate review.

13

The second possibility for petitioners*

14

standards concerns a national standard.

parochial determinations, they also, at least to my

17

mind, seem to favor a national community standard.

specified application of statewide community standards?
MR. STANKQi

Right.

And Pope was tried after

3

Morrison in front of the same trial judge, and after

4

denial of the same motion asserting that community

5

standards should not be included in the statute.

6

So we already had a construction from the

7

state court judge as to what he was going to do.

8

tendered the most favorable instruction we could get,

9

consistent with that construction.

10

We

I'd like to answer one of your concerns.

11

Justice O'Connor, when you -asked, well, what standard

12

would this Court apply in reviewing materials?

13

I think you recognize the problem, and that

14

is, that if you apply community standards to the value

15

component, how does this Court review the materials if

16

you're not familiar with the community standards in the

17

State of Illinois.

18

And one has to remember that in many cases the

19

state is not required to put on evidence

20

cases, the state is not required to put on evidence of

21

contemporary community standards.

— in all

So there really could be no meaningful
judicial review of that particular finding.
In

response to a question of yours, Justice

^tevens, I think

I heard counsel say that evidence of

value in New York could not be admitted in Illinois if

2

the state's construction was adopted.

3
4

And that's the problem.

That illustrates the

problem.
In Jenkins,

5

which

was a Georgia case, there

6

was all kinds of evidence about national acclaim,

7

critical reviews; that type of information.

8

even took judicial notice of information not originally

9

in the record .

10

The court

Now Jenkins, of course, didn't decide the case

11

on value.

12

suggested that evidence outside a particular community

13

should not be relevant to the constitutional

14

determination .

15
16

Unless the Court has any further questions, I
will not speak any further.

But I don't think this Court would or has

CHIEF JUSTICE RSHNQUIST;

The case is

(Whereupon, at

11j59 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
