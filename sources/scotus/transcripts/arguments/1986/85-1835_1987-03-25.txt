This case is here on certiorari to the

California Court of Appeals for the Second Appellate

14

It involvas the following salient facts.

They entered the subterranean garage of that

MR.

GUHIITSKI*

Pardon me?

You mean basement?

GUMINSKI:

Basement, yes, Your ROnor.

Well, why do you need

Who owned this trash receptacle?
GUMINSKI:

I do not know who is the

10

specific owner of the trash receptacle.

11

expressly disclosed in the record.
QUESTION:

12
13

MR.

Well, couldn't you have found out?

GUMINSKI:

have found out, yes,

QUESTION:

Couldn't the police department have found out?

It is possible that they could

us know.

is not

disclosed in the record.
I should like to point out, however, that the

19
20

question as to wno technically was the owner of this

21

apartment building and the garage, as we shall see, is

22

not really a critical issue,

if I may continue.

The officers went to the trash bin and

23
24

proceeded to search it -- I use the term in its popular

25

sense.

And halfway down they located a brown paper

1

shopping bag which they removed.
It contain mail addressed to Mr. Rooney and

2
3

evidences of

4

bookmaking operations.

The question posed is whether Mr. Rooney's

5

Fourth Amendment rights were violated by this

6

examination of the contents of this trash bag.

7
8

Our position is that it was not, and for two
different grounds.

9

The first ground is that Mr. Rooney had

10

abandoned the trash when it was placed in the communal

11

trash bin of this apartment building.

12

trash ceased to be his or anyone’s papers and effects

13

within the meaning of the Fourth

14

deposited in the trash bin.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR.

17

QUESTION:

That is, that

Amendment when it was

Mr. Guminski?

GUMINSKI;

Yes, Justice.

Is it true that under California

18

law as articulated in the Krivda case, that there is a

19

reasonable expectation of privacy in abandoned garbage

20

in California?

21

MR.

GUMINSKI:

I think that it can be stated,

22

yes. Your Honor.

23

absolute statement because the California Supreme Court

24

has not ruled

25

case.

But I cannot say that that is an

on a situation

such as that in the instant

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

But the indications are that

2

California would recognize a reasonable expectation of

3

privacy ?
MR. GUBIH3KI:

4

5

Yes,

Your Honor, and that was

the holding in the instant case by the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION’ :

6

I'm curious how that interfaces

7

then with the inquiry we would make under the Fourth

8

Amendment about whether a particular expectation of

9

privacy is reasonable.
Do we -- 3o we have to look at all at

10
11

California law?

3r do we ignore that and make it purely

12

a Federal inquiry —

13

MR.

14

QUESTION:

15

GUMIN3KI;

We submit --

-- on what's a reasonable

expectation?
MR. GUMINSKI:

16

Justice O'Connor, we submit

17

that this Court must use a Federal, national standard.

18

The question is whether an expectation of privacy is

19

such that society is prepared to recognize it as

20

reasonable, and the society in question is the nation as

21

a whole .

22

If this Couct were to determine the question

23

of reasonableness by a particular state, one may not be

24

speaking of the identical standard, because the state in

25

question might impose a much higher standard than that
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

required by the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION;

2
3

California may in fact, have a

higher class of trash than other states, too.

4

MR.

GUMINSKI:

Yes,

Your Honor.

It apparently

5

is valued that when garbage is put in it somehow emerges

6

when taken out by a police officer with an aura of

7

respectability .

8

And

the two grounds that we have just stated

9

are such that

the second ground, that is, a reasonable

10

expectation of privacy ground, is inferior or

11

subordinate to the first ground.
Because there can be no Fourth Amendment

12

13

rooted reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to

14

items which have ceased to be papers and effects within

15

the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
This Court,

16

in Oliver v.

United

States,

17

confirmed the ruling in Hester than open fields are note

18

embraced by the protection of the Fourth Amendment.
And

19

one independent ground was that this was

20

precluded by the explicit language of the Fourth

21

Amendment.

22
23
24
25

And

this Court proceeded to note that Kate*

fields doctrine to a basement?
