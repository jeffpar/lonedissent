who has been accused of murder and attempted murder.
There is no dispute in this case that the

2
3

extradition request made by Puerto Rico fully complies

4

with all statutory and constitutional requirements.
There is no dispute, either, that the duty of

5

6

the Governor of Iowa to extradite Mr. Calder is an

7

absolute duty, both mandatory and ministerial, under the

8

Constitution and the statute.
All that is at issue here is whether the

9
10

court, the Federal court, may command the governor to

11

obey that duty, or whether the governor may violate it

12

with impunity.
Now the facts are as follows.

13

Mr. Ronald

14

Calder on — in 1931 drover his car into a married

15

couple in a parting lot of a grocery store in Puerto

16

Rico.

17

pregnant wife was tilled, as well as her unborn child.

18

The husband was injured but survived.

His

The justice — a judge, I*m sorry, of the

19

Superior Court of Puerto Rico, after a preliminary

20

hearing, found probable cause to charge Calder with

21

murder and attempted murder.

22

This was done after a hearing, as I said, in

23

which the judge heard testimony from sworn witnesses,

24

and in which Calder was represented by counsel.

25

The witnesses, the eyewitnesses, told the
4

(202) 628-9300

judge that Calder had deliberately run his car over —
drove his car into the couple, attempted to run down the
couple with his car, and that after the wife was down,
he repeatedly run over the body, her body, with his car.
Mr. Calder was freed on bail after the
District Attorney filed informations against him for
these two alleged crimes, and he failed to appear at two
successive hearings in the criminal case.
And the court -- another judge in the district
— in the Superior Court ordered him to be arrested,
issued a warrant of arrest, after declaring him a
fugitive.
He was found in Iowa, his native state, and
there a request was made to the Governor of Iowa that
Calder be extradited.
The request of the Governor of Puerto Rico was
-- fully complied #ith all the requirements, both
statutory and constitutional.
In spite of that, an extradition hearing was
held .
QUESTION:

Iowa was his home, was it not?

MR. SALDANA;
QUESTION;

Iowa was his home, yes, sir.

Do you know why so low a bond was

imposed under a murder charge?
MR. SALDANA;

In Puerto Rico, you mean, sir?

QUESTION:

Yes, in Puerto Rico.

2

NR. SALDANA:

Well, he was first charged with

3

manslaughter, ani a small bond was requested from him.

4

Apparently, what the court felt was that there was no

5

danger that he would not appear.

And he was working in

And only $5,000 bond was required from him.

I suppose there isn't any

But it strikes me as a low bond on a

13

MR. SALDANA:

Yes, it is.

14

The Governor of Iowa in the — on the basis of

15

the extradition hearing, denied the request for

16

extradition.

17

At the hearing, evidence was admitted to -- by

18

the declarations and testimony of Calder, of Calder's

19

companion at the scene of the crime, of the alleged

20

crimes, and of Calder's attorneys, to the fact that the

21

Puerto Rico courts were unable to administer properly

22

justice in this case, in Calder's case.

23

Calder and his other two witnesses stated that

24

there was a prejudice against white American men like

25

Calder, and that, under those circumstances, the trial

would not be fair to him.
They also brought hearsay evidence to the

2
3

effect that witnesses had been bought -- bought off in

4

Puerto Rico in some cases, and they attacked in that way

5

the integrity aid the quality of the justice of -- that

6

is afforded by the Puerto Rico courts.
Nov, the Governor of Iowa tried to intercede

7

8

on Calder's behalf in some plea bargaining between

9

Caller's attorneys and the Puerto Rico prosecutors.

10

They were bargaining on whether to accept a plea of

11

guilty from Caller on a lesser charge, and also, whether

12

a sentence of probation would be imposed.
The prosecutors conditioned all plea

13
14

bargaining upon Calder's voluntary return to Puerto

15

Rico.

16

some talks with Governor Romero of Puerto Rico.

17

talks failed, and thereon, the Governor of Iowa denied

18

extradition.

19

And the governor then tried to intercede and had
These

The Commonwealth filed a complaint in the

20

District Court seeding a writ of mandamus against the

21

Governor of Iowa to order him to extradite Calder.

22

The court refused

to issue the writ.

It held

23

that it was bound by the decision of this Court in

24

Dennison — in Kentucky v. Dennison;

25

court had now power to order the state governor to

that the Federal

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

extradite Calder
The United States Court of Appeals for the

2
3

Eighth Circuit affirmed that judgment reluctantly,

4

stating that the reasoning and the underpinnings of the

5

Dennison case had been undermined, had been eroded to

6

such a degree that the court — the only court empowered

7

to do so, the Supreme Court, should reconsider it.

8

Now —

9

QUESTION;

You agree, Mr. Saldana, don't you,

10

that we would have to overrule Kentucky against Dennison

11

to rule in your favor here?

12

MR. SALDANA;

13

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Now, the —

Mr. Saldana, why is that — why is

14

that so?

That is so only if you insist that Puerto Rico

15

is a state within the meaning of the provision here.
You have a statute that purports to require

16
17

extradition to either a state, a district or a

18

territory.

19

different insofar as its ability is concerned to require

20

a state to extradite to a territory, than it is with

21

regard to its power to require a state to extradite to

22

another state?

23

Might now the power of the United States be

MR. SALDANA;

Nell, the power of Congress to

24

enact the extradition act is based on the implied power

25

of Congress to implement the extradition clause.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And the --

2

QUESTION;

Well, maybe this statute, insofar

3

as it might apply to Puerto Rico, is not an

4

implementation of the extradition clause of the

5

Constitution but is an implementation of Congress* power

6

to govern territories.

7

HR. SALDANA;

Well, that power cannot justify

8

the Congress ordering a state to extradite a fugitive to

9

a territory.

10

It would operate for Congress to direct a

11

territory to extradite to a state, or to extradite to

12

another territory.

13

But the power of Congress to implement the

14

clause as it did, ordering a state to extradite a

15

fugitive to a territory, mast rest on something other

16

than the territorial power.

17

It rests on the implied power of Congress,

18

under the vary -- under the extradition clause itself,

19

to implement that statute.

20

And for -- history reveals that the

21

extradition statute was approved in 1793 a few years

22

after the Constitution was ratified; and the people and

23

the Congressmen who were there were, many of them were

24

members of the Convention, lawyers and framers of the

25

Constitution, who had at least drafted the Constitution
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and participated in the process of ratification.
Now it has long been considered -- it is

2
3

really beyond question -- that this contemporary

4

interpretation of Congress,

5

extradition clause, is valid , and that it shows that

6

Congress, in the extradition — that the extradition

7

clause of the Constitution goes beyond states, beyond

8

the 13 states of tie Union* that it includes other

9

entities like territories, like the Commonwealth, like

10

of the meaning of the

the District of CoLumbia.

11

Now we may not have -- it may not be necessary

12

to decide that question, because the statute, as Justice

13

Scalia points out, imposes the duty of extradition upon

14

the Iowa State Governor.

15

that it is a valid statute.

There is no problem, no doubt,

And there is no doubt that it applies to

16
17

Puerto Rico.

Before 1952, this Court so expressly

18

held.

19

extradition act was undisturbed in its application to

20

Puerto Rico.

And after 1952, it is also clear that the

QUESTION:

21

But that statute was in effect at

22

the time Kentucky against Dennison was decided, wasn’t

23

it?

24

MR. SALDANA:

25

QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I did not hear you.

I thought you were referring to the

(202) 628-9300

statute of 1793

2

HR. SALDANA:

3

QUESTIDN:

4

Yes.

Ani that statute was in effect at

the time that Kentucky v. Dennison was decided.
MR. SALDANA:

5

That's right, sir.

And the

6

Dennison decision interprets both the Constitution and

7

the statute.

8

the statute and the Constitution are coterminous.
They speak in the same language.

9
10

Ani it did interpret both together because

same words.

They use the

They must be read in pari materia.

11

And it is impossible for this Court to decide

12

the statutory issue without reaching the Constitutional

13

issue.

So both -- they are inseparable.
QUESTIDN:

14

Mr. Saldana, not that it matters,

15

but what position do you hold in the government of

16

Puerto Rico?
MR. SALDANA:

DUESTIDN:

everybody has a title but you.

I am special counsel in this

That's right.

And I was just wondering, you're

authorized to speak for the government?

QUESTIDN:

Yes.

Thank you.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. SALDANA;

Well, we feel that no case, or

2

few cases at least, would better demonstrate that

3

Dennison should be overruled that this, the present one.

4

First, tie Dennison decision leaves the

5

governor free to violate with impunity his duty to

6

extradite, the duty that is imposed both by the

7

Constitution and by the statute.

8
9

Ronald

Calder has been able to find precisely

what the extradition clause and the extradition statute

10

intended to prevent.

11

asylum, in Iowa.

12
13
14
15
16

He has found an asylum, a free

And he has been able to avoid altogether
responding for his alleged crimes.
Ha has obtained what really amounts to an
immunity in Iowa.
That violates the concern of the extradition

17

clause, the concern that was at the core of the

18

extradition clause, to -- which is the protection of law

19

and order within tie respective borders of each state

20

and defeats and frustrates the administration and

21

enforcement of criminal law in every state.

22

The result, of course, is unsound, and is

23

contrary to the express mandate of the Constitution and

24

of the statute.

25

Second, the Dennison rule, as seen in this
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

case, the result it has in this case, is that it

2

frustrates and defeats, also, the concern of the

3

extradition clause for comity and respect between

4

states.

5

This case shows how the Dennison rule invites

6

precisely the kind of friction, the kind of

7

disagreements and retaliation that the clause, the

8

extradition clause, was designed and intended to prevent.

9

QUESTION;

Well, Nr. Saldana, the State of

10

Iowa in its brief suggests, as a last argument, that

11

Puerto Rico isn't entitled to use the clause or the

12

statute at all, because you aren't a state; that you're

13

a territory.

14

MR. SALDANA:

Well, Your Honor, that argument

15

really is not in point.

16

ago, Puerto Rico is invoking both the Constitution and

17

the statute,

18

believes that the Constitution of itself, on its own

19

power, extends to Puerto Rico, the constitutional clause

20

involved here, the extradition clause; as do the other

21

clauses, the privileges and

22

faith and credit clauses.

23

Because, as I explained awhile

and it does so because of the fact that it

immunities, and the full

Because those clauses are designed to create a

24

national unity within the federation, the American

25

federation.

And there is a

need to extend those

provisions to a state like Puerto Rico that is so near QUESTION;

2
3

You say it*s -- Puerto Rico is a

state?

4

MR. SALDANA;

Well, it’s a state not in the

5

sense that it is a state of the Union, but it is a state

6

that is joined with the United States by a compact, and

7

has the degree, the same degree, a similar degree, of

8

autonomy and independence as the other states of the

9

union.
QUESTION;

10
11

the United States could employ the extradition clause?
MR. SALDANA;

15
16

Do you think just any territory of

yes.

I think so, sir, I think so,

I think so because —
•

QUESTION:

Even though that isn’t what the

clause says.
MR. SALDANA;

The clause refers only to states

17

of the union.

But for functional purposes, and for

18

historical reasons, the clause should be read to extend,

19

of itself, to states, to other entities like the

20

Commonwealth

and tie territories.

21

However, it did not --

22

QUESTION;

Maybe it should be written that

23

way, but why should it be read that way if it wasn’t

24

written that

25

way?

MR. SALDANA;

Well, it wasn’t written that
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

way, but it was interpreted by the members -- by
Congress at an early date when the object and scope of
the clause was common knowledge.
And the Congressmen who dealt with the
statute, the

1793 statute, which has not been

substantially changed until today, interpreted that
clause to mean that it extends to the territories.

At

that time there were two territories, the territory
northwest of the river Ohio and -QUESTION*

Well, it didn't need to interpret

that clause to pass that statute.

But it did; it said

any state or territory, the extradition statute does.
And so you may claim protection of the
statute, may you not?
MB. SALDANA:

Yes.

And once the statute

applies, as we claim it does, then as I stated a second
ago, the constitutional issue raised in the Dennison
case as to the interpretation of the clause, of the
extradition clause, must also be reached by

this Court,

because the statute and the Constitution —
QUESTION:

If we — if we interpreted the

statute differently than the Dennison case did, we
wouldn't have to reach any constitutional issue at all.
MR. SALDANA:

But the statute, Kr . Justice

White, the statute repeats the words of the Constitution.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

2

Except it’s got the word

"territory" in it.
MR. SALDANA;

3

Yes, but we are concerned here

4

with not only whether territories are covered but what

5

kind of duty is imposed on the state governor to

6

extradite.

7

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t there some indication

8

in the Dennison case that the court actually thought the

9

statute imposed a duty, but only a moral duty.

10

MR. SALDANA;

11

QUESTION;

That’s right.

And that it wasn’t an enforceable

12

duty, and wasn’t intended to be enforceable.

13

what the Court said?

14

MR. SALDANA;

15

QUESTION;

16
17

Isn't that

That is right.

So that’s a construction of a

Federal statute.
MR. SALDANA;

The Court interpreted both the

18

Constitution and t.ie statute to mean that.

19

matter of fact Chief Justice Taney said, the

20

Constitution leaves the performance of the duty to the

21

fidelity of the governor to the Constitution of the

22

United States.

23

And as a

It is not a legal duty;, it’s a moral duty.

24

And the statute necessarily does so, necessarily leaves

25

the duty as one which is unenforceable, which is a moral
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

duty
So it is impossible, I respectfully submit, to

2

t

3

decide this case on the basis of a statutory

4

interpretation, without reaching the Constitutional

5

question involved.
QUESTION!

6

That may be, but not because Puerto

7

Rico is a state, bat because in order to interpret the

8

statute as being mandatory, since it applies to both

9

states and territories, you

would have to contravene

10

Kentucky v. Dennison, whether or not Puerto Rico is a

11

state.
I mean. I’m quite

12

— it's an uphill battle to

13

convince me that when the Constitution refers to states,

14

and says states, and elsewhere it refers to territory,

15

it makes no difference between the two.
So it seems to me

16
17

under this statute,

18

not as a state, which —

it comes under it as a territory,

MR. SALDR.NAt

19

that if Puerto Rico comes

Well, that's an alternative

20

ground for reaching the Constitutional question.

21

the Constitutional issue —
QUESTIDNt

22

I'm not anxious reach the

constitutional question.

24

it.

25

But

I

mean, I would as soon avoid

But it may well be that you can't read the
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

statute the way you want to read it, or you couldn't

2

read it to be mandatory foe territories and permissive

3

for states, because it doesn't purport to distinguish

4

between the two.
But I hope you will tell me we don't have to

5

6

reach it because Puerto Rico is a state, because I don’t

7

think you will persuade me that Puerto Rico is a state.
MR. SALDANAi

8
9
10

Hell, if you interpret the

Constitution narrowly and literally, with all due
respect, you're right. Justice Scalia.
If you interpret the Constitution functionally

11
12

and from an historical point of view, you may not be

13

right as to that point.
But again, I say it's unnecessary to decide

14
15

that issue,

because there is the alternative ground

16

whether Puerto Rico is a state today or a territory, it

17

is covered by tie statute.
And the case can be decided under the

18
19

statute.

But in deciding the statutory issue, this

20

Court will have to reach the constitutional issue.

21

QUESTIDN:

22

MR. SALDANAi

23
24
25

Hhy?

Why?

Because they, both the statute

and the Constitution, read -- must be interepreted in a-QUESTION:

MB. SALDANA;

I ion*t think, so.

MR. APPEL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think I can best assist the Court today with
a three-part presentation about the extradition clause.
First,

I would like to engage in a brief

24

survey of its history, with special emphasis on the

25

constitutional foliage that has grown up in the

extradition area in the absence of judicial

intervention.
Second, I’d like to take a look at the court

3
4

as an institution, and ask ourselves question;

5

be preferable for this Court to intervene and make

6

extradition decisions rather than the governors of the

7

state as a matter of constitutionali policy?
And than finally,

8

Would it

I’d like to take a guick

Iowa has a fundamentally different presentation to make

4

and have not intervened under state constitutions which

And there’s some 8,000

And as a result, in the absence of this

6
7

judicial intervention, an executive common lav tradition

8

of interpreting the extradition clause of the

9

Constitution and the state constitutions has developed.
And what that executive common law tradition

10

11

is basically is that the — the extradition clause in

12

the Constitution does establish a general principle to

13

be applied when states request that a fugitive be

14

delivered up. • And the language is, of course "shall".
Just as the First Amendment says Congress

15
16

shall pass no law.

17

says, full faith and credit shall be given.
And that has been recognized by all the

governors.

And the full faith and credit clause

And that's where we are in this case.
at the very edges of the doctrine.

And the question is,

case — there’s a canvass.
My bottom line point, however, is that this

2
3

executive tradition has developed over a hundred years

4

in interpreting -- over 200 years, really -- in

5

interpreting that constitutional provision.
Secondly, informal mechanisms of resolution of

6
7

extradition disputes have grown up.

There’s a National

8

Governors Association, of course. And there was

9

reference to discussion between the governors of these

10

states with respect to this extradition matter, and that

11

occurred in this case.

12

There’s a national association of extradition

13

officials, and thesr put out these manuals and pamphlets

14

and so forth.

15

discuss extradition guestions.

And they get

together and debate and

So there's been -- in the absence of judicial

16

intervention, which has been gone from the environment

18

for 200 years, these informal mechanisms have grown up.

MR. APPEL;

2UESTI3N;

That's true, of course.
At a time when/ if we had said we

6

MR. APPEL;

QUESTION;

That's quite true, isn’t it.
You don't think that maybe things

8

are a little different now,

whether that case was unduly influenced by the times in

and we should reconsider

MR. APPEL;

No question that things are a

But it seems to me, as a matter of

14

constitutional policy, the courts ought to stay out of

15

these matters .

16

And I'd like to move on to my second --

17

QUESTION;

Well, I'm suggesting that the

18

policy was a very pragmatic one; that the times were

19

such that the Court might not have thought it could have

power from governors to the judiciary.

4

There's no such thing as a

And just as the full faith and credit clause,

5

for instance, says, full faith and credit shall be

6

given, the courts have engaged in a process of

7

interpretation of when that clause applies and when it

8

does not apply.

9

Secondly, of course mandamus doctrine allows

10

for all kinds of egui table defenses.

It's not -- the

mandamus is not granted in an automatic fashion.

The extradition clause plainly says, when a

someone who flees from one state to another is guilty of

a Federal crime, if the Attorney General authorizes

You can see that Congress has been very chary

about getting into this field.

12

One of

13

the reasons is, they were afraid that this person if

incarcerated in Puerto Rico would be killed; and that

appears in the Appendix as part of the extradition

There was a serious concern about the safety

state; and no one can go into Federal habeas corpus or

10

state habeas corpus and say, look, no authority; you

can't do it.

absolutely, crystal, perfectly clear, and no court has

held otherwise; just as they've also held that no courts
