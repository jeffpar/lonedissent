The Secretary issues a final decision cn

The particular feature of Section 405 that is

in dispute here is Congress*

permanent relief.

The statute states that an employee

10

finds reasonable cause to believe that his discharge was

11

in violation of the statute.

12

This interim reinstatement remains in effect

during the subsequent evidentiary hearing and through

14

the resolution of the case on the merits.

QUESTION:

The question

Kay I ask you, Mr. Pincus, because

17

I’ll tell you, I’m concerned

18

seme of these things that happen in this case.

20

investigation be completed within 60 days?

FINCUS;

Well, Your Honor, I don’t think

that the Secretary ignores that requirement, just in

locate.

happens that the investigation, the

7

QUESTION:

8

MR.

9
10

Was this a complex case?

PINCUS:

This particular case involved

many different claims by Mr.

Hufstetler that he’d

engaged in a variety of safety-related activities.

11

QUESTION;

He may have gotten the authority

12

from the same place that the last case we have from the

13

Secretary of Labor got the authority, which as I recall

14

was very belated processing.

15

MR.

PINCUS:

Well, yes. Your Honor.

I was

16

going to mention that, that case, Brock against Pierce

17

County,

18

which the Court interpreted as directory and

19

non-manda tory.

20

which involved a similar statutory time limit,

QUESTION:

But there was a good deal of

21

legislative history that supported the Secretary’s

22

argument there that that was directed to a different

23

purpose.

24

there?

25

But there’s no such history in this case, is

MR.

PINCUS:

Well,

Your Honor, we think that

(202) 628-9300

1

the statutory scheme would be

2

the same rules should apply.

3

interpreted to divest the Secretary of jurisdiction,

4

then the Secretary's failure to act would cut off the

5

employee’s rights, and it couldn't be that Congress

6

intended that a statute that was intended to help

7

employees would fail if the Secretary, because of lack

8

cf administrative resources or just the complexity cf

9

the particular investigation, wasn't able to complete

10

13

If the time limit was

the investigation within that time period.

11
12

indicates itself that

Congress obviously wanted to protect
employees .
QUESTION;

And whenever the Secretary does

14

complete it — here I guess it was about eleven months

15

-- then the back pay obligation attaches,

16

it, if he finds reasonable cause.

17

HR. PINCUS;

Yes, but the back pay obligation

18

runs from the discharge.

19

with the length of the investigation.

20

QUESTION;

toe, doesn't

It doesn't have anything to do

Well, it's a little more serious if

21

an employer has to wait a year or so and then finds he's

22

got a year's back pay to pay, which I suppose he’ll

23

never see again once he pays it.

24
25

MR.

PINCUS;

Well, he doesn’t owe the back pay

until after the entire — there's been a final

adjudication on the merits
QUESTION:

Oh, he doesn't have tc pay it at

the time of the reasonable cause determination?
MR.

FINCUS:

No, the only part of the order

5

that goes into effect immediately cn the reasonable

6

cause finding

is the reinstatement.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR.

9
10

I see.

FINCUS:

The other remedies don't go intc

effect until the order becomes final.
QUESTION:

Still, it might be considered a

11

quid pro quo for the employers who are subject to this

12

Act that what's taken away is that they have to

13

reinstate; on the other hand, what they get is a pretty

14

good estimation of whether they're going tc have to pay

15

back pay ultimately.

16

That is to say, if the Secretary finds against

17

them on that initial determination I expect a lot of

18

employers would simply threw

19

and not be subject to any more back pay liability.

20

by delaying that for a long time, the Secretary has

21

taken away a lot of the quid pro quo.

22

MR.

FINCUS;

Well,

And

on the other hand, Your

23

Honor, the employers are protected by the thoroughness

of the investigation, because the Secretary's

Just to briefly consider stating the facts in

5

this case, the proceeding began cn November 22nd,

6

when Appellee discharged Jerry Hufstetler, who was one

7

of its truck drivers, on the ground that he had

8

intentionally disabled his truck to obtain extra pay.

9

Hufstetler filed a grievance under his collective

1983,

10

bargaining agreement, asserting that he had been

11

discharged in

after his grievance was rejected he filed a complaint

with the Secretary under Section 405.

The Secretary conducted his investigation,

which took eleven months, and in the course of that

investigation

18

side of the story.

19

Appellee was informed of the charges and

The Secretary issued a reasonable cause

21

temporary basis pending the completion of the

proceedings.

24

federal district court.

(202) 628-9300

1

the temporary reinstatement order cn the ground that the

2

order violated Appellee's due process rights.

3

district court issued the injunction and held that the

4

due process clause requires the Secretary to held an

5

evidentiary hearing before issuance of the temporary

6

reinstatement order, and that Section 405 was

7

unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted the

8

issuance of such an order without the prior hearing.

9

Now, both sides in

The

this case agree that an

10

employer is entitled to an evidentiary hearing prior to

11

a final determination of the lawfulness of the

12

discharge.

13

must be held before the discharged employee is

14

temporarily reinstated or afterward, and in cur view the

15

due process clause as it has been interpreted in this

16

Court’s cases dees not preclude Congress from

17

authorizing a temporary reinstatement prior to an

18

evidentiary hearing.

19

The only question is whether the hearing

Now, this constitutional question is not new

20

to the Court.

21

considered the question of the timing of an evidentiary

22

hearing in connection with an interim or temporary

23

deprivation of liberty.

In a line of recent cases, the Court has

QUESTION;

Mr. Pincus, do I understand the

Government concedes that there is a property interest on

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

the part of the employer here?
SR.

FINCUS;

Yes, Ycur Honor, we do, although

3

let me add that we think, the nature of the property

4

interest is quite insubstantial as compared tc the

5

property interests that the Court has considered in its

6

prior cases.

7

8
9

QUESTION;

Well, what precisely is the

property interest?
MR.

FINCUS;

Well,

the interest as we see it

10

is the employer’s right to discharge an employee that it

11

has under its contract.

12

QUESTION;

And is there some case from this

13

Court that you regard as peculiarly apposite in making

14

that concession?

15

MR.

FINCUS:

No, Your Honor, we don’t rely on

16

any particular case.

17

reinstatement, obviously if the employer was just

18

required to pay money in the interim, then that payment

19

of money itself would be a loss of property.

20

let me add that if there were no

In this case, since there is reinstatement the

21

employer gets a day’s work for a day’s pay, and so

22

really the only diminution in his rights is this

23

question cf being able to control the workplace, which,

24

as we discuss in our brief, is already subject to quite

25

a lot of federal regulation.

2

QUESTIONi

Well, the order to reinstate would

require back pay?

3

MR.

FINCUS;

The order -- the back pay

4

obligation does not become effective until the order is

5

finally upheld.

6

found to be unlawful, he would be required tc pay back

7

pay.

8

10

QUESTION;

You don't think it's a deprivation

of property if somebody requires me to hire somebody
that I don't want to hire?

11

12

But eventually, if the discharge were

MR.

FINCUS:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

That's

why we --

13

QUESTION;

I thought you just said that there

14

would have been a clear -- the mere payment cf the mcney

15

would have been a property interest if all the Secretary

16

did was require the back pay, without requiring the man

17

tc be re-employed.

18

But you seem to suggest that, since you're not

19

just requiring the money to be paid, you're also

20

requiring the individual to work, that somehow it's

21

different.

22

hire somebody you don't want to hire and tc pay them

23

when you don't want to pay them is clearly property.

24
25

but it seems to me that requiring you to

MR.

FINCUS;

Well, Your Honor, that's why we

think there's a property interest here.

But we think

1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that in assessing the weight of that interest it's

2

necessary to see exactly what the employer is losing,

3

and we think it's —

4

And you’re saying he’s net losing

QUESTION:

5

much because he’s getting the labor of a person whose

6

labor he doesn’t want, and you don’t think that’s very

7

much ?

8
9

HR.

PINCUS:

Well, we think it’s something,

but we don’t think it’s anything like a person who needs

10

disability not getting disability benefits or an

11

employee being discharged or someone who is dependent on

12

money for their livelihood losing that very money.

13

The employer is losing something, tut in

14

comparison to the other property interests that the

15

Court has considered it’s not that much.

16

QUESTION:

But doesn’t the employer also lose

17

a contract right under the collective bargaining

18

agreement to have an arbitration award enforced?

19

there was arbitration, as I understand it, and

20

apparently the ALJ had a different view of the matter.

21

Here

But under the contract he had a right, a

22

contract right, to terminate this employee, didn’t he,

23

apart from the statute?

24
25

HR. PINCUS:

Yes, he did, Your Hcnor.

But we

don’t think that adds anything more to the analysis.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

mean, that’s the same right that he has not to pay

2

someone he doesn’t want to pay.

3

arbitration proceeding, he wouldn't have that right.

4

the fact that he won it doesn't give him anything mere.

5

It just means that he has that right.

6

If he had lest the
Sc

In contrast to what we see as this property

7

interest, although a less substantial property interest,

8

of the employee, there is the quite weighty interest of

9

the Government here.

Section 405 is based on what the

10

Court has characterized as the Government's paramount

11

interest in highway safety.

12

When the statute was enacted, Congress had

13

before it evidence of massive noncompliance by the motor

14

transportation industry with the federal safety

15

standards that apply in that area, and Congress

16

concluded that if employees were protected from

17

retaliatory discharges and thus able to act to enforce

18

safety standards that compliance with safety standards

19

would be encouraged.

20

And therefore, it adopted Section 405 to

21

provide employees with this protection.

22

clear that the interim reinstatement protection that's

23

at issue here is essential to Congress’ employee

24

protection plan.

25

And it seems

An employee has to pay his monthly tills for

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

feed and shelter on an ongoing basis as they come due,

2

and so an award of back pay several years down the line

3

does not give the employee the protection that he really

4

needs if the protection that Congress designed is to

5

become real.

QUESTION;

I suppose that’s part of the 60 day

requirement, tec.

up the investigation period and they have gotten

somewhat speedier.

QUESTION;

And as we

I can’t resist also asking you

15

about your interpretation of the sentence;

Unless you read it into this 120

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

sentence I just read to you, because that certainly

2

sounds as though the Secretary has to get through with

3

the matter within

120 days.

4

But you don't read it that way, do you?

5

MR. FINCUSj

No, Your Honor, the Secretary

6

hasn't interpreted the statute that way.

7

issued regulations that do set time limits on the AIJ's

8

action.

9

day period had a different interpretation, we wouldn't

10

Eut he has

And again, we wouldn't read -- even if the 120

read it as cutting off the Secretary's jurisdiction.

11

But again, the Secretary is cognizant of his

12

obligations to move speedily, but especially in an

13

investigatory period he has to balance the employer's

14

rights and the employee's rights in wanting to reach a

15

fair determination, and also in the subsequent period

16

the employer may need extra time to get his case

17

together and in that case it

18

ahead if the employer is the one that's asking for the

19

time.

20

QUESTION

wouldn't be fair to press

Is there anything in the record to

21

suggest that the process that he actually follows is any

22

more expeditious than convening a very, on short notice,

23

an adversary hearing like you might have on a motion for

24

a temporary restraining order in a court?

25

I don’t understand why you have to proceed
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

without having an adversary proceeding promptly held.
What is the need for this particular procedure?

Can you

tell us?
MR.

PINCIJS;

Well, the fair reading of the

statute, I think, is that Congress intended the
Secretary to conduct an investigation and for
reinstatement tc happen on the conclusion cf that
investigation, and for adversary proceedings to follow.
Now, the Secretary’s investigaticn has tc be
comprehensive and is as fast as possible.

And we think

there is no way for the Secretary to conduct a less
comprehensive investigation and still meet his
obligations under the statute.
So the effect of an evidentiary hearing before
reinstatement —
QUESTION;

You’re going to have a hard time

convincing me that they spend eleven months working on
this case and nothing else.

I imagine they have a whole

lot of cases and this case took its turn with a very
busy administrative office.
Or do you suggest that this amount cf time is
necessary on every case that
MR.

PINCUS;

comes?

No, Your Honor, we don't suggest

that, and as the times that we’ve submitted in our reply
brief show, that’s not what the Secretary actually does

in every case.

time .

3

In this case it happened tc take a lcng

There was quite a controversy about the facts,

4

and the complainant alleged that he had engaged in a

5

variety of safety-related activities that all had to be

6

checked out.

7

drivers and so sometimes it’s hard to locate the

8

relevant people in order to talk to them because they

9

are on the road.

10

But

In addition, these people are truck

I’m not suggesting that this case is

11

typical, and we don’t think that the Court should base

12

its due process decision on this, the facts of this

13

particular case.

14

due process decisions are based on the generality of

15

cases and, although the time happened to be long in this

16

case, we think it generally isn’t.

The Court said a number of times that

17

And we think that the time that the Secretary

18

takes for an investigation is what he think is required

19

tc meet his statutory obligations, and if a hearing is

20

required before reinstatement that that is just going to

21

be an additional time piled on top of the investigation,

22

and so it will delay reinstatement.

23

QUESTION*

Well, I’m not sure that follows.

24

I’m not sure if you didn’t subpoena everybody in at

25

once, as you do in emergency proceedings often, you

what’s going on.

4

But I suppose there's some merit.

5

QUESTION;

6

7

I would think in eleven months you

could have had your evidentiary hearing.
MR. PINCUS:

Well,

Your Honor, that might be

8

true in this particular case, but it may net be true in

9

many, many cases.

10

And especially where --

QUESTION;

Well, it might be so, as Justice

11

Stevens says, if you really lived up to the 60 day

12

requirement, why, you cculd order reinstatement and then

13

maybe take some time to have an evidentiary hearing.

14

you're going tc skip that time limit, you tetter hold

15

FINCUS;

Well, the statute requires that

16

the post-reinstatement hearing be expeditiously

17

conducted, and the Secretary has issued regulations that

18

do set down t.ime limits on when that will happen -- for

19

every process, every stage along the process culminating

20

in the Secretary's final decision, which amount to seven

21

months, which is less than the period that the Court has

recognized in both Mathews and Loudermill as

appropriate.

The

14

might be that those time limits might be exceeded and it

might be open for an employer to argue that he’s been

subject to a due process violation.

In a particular case it

18

But that doesn’t mean that the scheme is

19

invalid, and the only question here is whether the

20

scheme should be upheld and we submit that it should.

21

I’d like to briefly discuss another way of

22

looking at the case that we think confirms the

23

constitutionality of what Congress has done here.

24

interim reinstatement remedy could also be viewed as at

25

accommodation of conflicting interests, similar to

the employer has an interest

On the other hand,

in protecting his authority

9

And in drafting Section 405, Congress had tc

10

decide where the interim burden was going to fall in a

11

dispute over the discharge.

12

absence of interim relief would threaten the employee

13

with the prolonged loss of his means of livelihood and

14

adversely affect employees’ willingness to engage in

15

conduct protected under the statute.

16

And as I*ve discussed, the

On the other hand, permitting interim

17

reinstatement does not unduly burden employers because

18

they suffer no economic loss in the sense that they get

19

a day's work for a day’s pay.

20

So in these circumstances, Congress made a

21

reasonable determination that it was the employer that

22

could best bear the burden of the dispute over the

23

discharge where there has been a showing, based on an

24

investigation, that there was reasonable cause to

25

believe that the discharge was unlawful.

MR. TCWERSi

I don’t suggest that the APA is

QUESTION;

4

MR.

You’re saying by analogy.

TOWERS;

I’m offering it by analogy, and

5

the analogy is offered to point out that Congress has

6

recognized that there is a substantial risk of error in

7

combining those functions.

8

There is a substantial risk of error evidenced

9

by the fact that the investigator and then the

10

supervisor and the regional administrator make

11

which is contrary to a prior arbitration award which is

12

based on an adversarial hearing.

13

significant questions as to whether or not there is

14

error in the investigator and regional administrator’s

15

decision if there is reasonable cause wnen it upsets a

16

prior arbitration

17

decision

That certainly raises

award.

This statute need net, however, be declared

18

unconstitutional by this Court.

19

neutral during the investigative stage.

20

provision in the statute which provides that the

21

employer may not have a hearing during the investigative

22

stage and before the order of preliminary

23

reinstatement.

24
25

The statute is hearing
There is no

There is nothing in the statute that says he
must, either.

The court below recognized this and said
53
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that the statute is only unconstitutional to the extent

2

that it mandates preliminary reinstatement without a

3

prior evidentiary hearing.

4

This Court in Califano versus Yamasaki

5

recognized that a hearing neutral statute can have read

6

into it a hearing requirement.

7

situation to the extent that the issues to he resolved

8

in the hearing or resolved by the decisionmaker were

9

inherently subjective, were inherently controversial,

10

It had a similar fact

and therefore an evidentiary hearing was necessary.
QUESTION;

11

But the Secretary — the statute

12

would not prevent the Secretary from providing hearings

13

before?

14

HR. TOWERS;

15

QUESTION;

16
17

No, it would not.
So the only issue is whether the

statute as applied in this case is unconstitutional.
HR. TOWERS;

The Secretary in his new

18

regulations has not called for any kind of a hearing.

19

He's continuing on the same guidelines and procedures.

20
21
22

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but he could under

the statute.
HR. TOWERS;

He could under the statute.

And

23

in fact, under a similar statute, the Hine Safety Act,

24

when it was declared unconstitutional for the same

25

reason, the Secretary instituted hearing procedures.
54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

was a hearing neutral statute as well.

2

So I suggest to the Court that this case can

3

be resolved without declaring the statute

4

unconstitutional by simply finding and ruling that the

5

Secretary must institute procedures which meet the

6

minimum requirements of procedural due process.

7

For

all of these reasons, I suggest to the

8

Court that the decision of the court below was correct

g

and ask that it be affirmed.

ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESC.,

ON BHALF OF APPELLANTS

16

MR.

17

I first want to address the question of the

PINCUSs

A few points, Your Honor.

18

information that's available to the employer during the

19

investigatory process.

20

require it, there is nothing

21

nothing in the record to indicate what happened here.

22

Although the statute doesn't
— first of all, there is

But the Department informs us that its

23

practice is to provide employers with the substance of

24

the information that the Secretary is relying on for his

25

reasonable cause finding, so that they have a chance to
55
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

respond to it.

2

agree that that information can be provided.

3

We don't take a position that -- so we

With respect to the names of the witnesses,

4

however, we think it’s important that those names net he

5

disclosed until the time of testimony, because there is

6

a genuine danger that those people will be intimidated

7

and that they will not testify, and we think that they

8

should be protected until — under the rationale that

9

the Court has used in its FOIA cases, until the time

10

comes when they take the stand, so that the employer

11

won't have an opportunity to tamper with the

12

proceeding.

13

Now, about the question of when the hearing is

14

required, Roadway relies on seme other statutes that

15

don't require -- that don't have preliminary remedies,

16

for the proposition that there is no need for a prior

17

hearing here.

18

But the Congress has made a different choice.

19

Congress has created a preliminary remedy here, and

20

that's the reason why there's no -- that's the reason

21

why this case is different and the reason why this

22

Court's decisions in cases like Loudermill are

23

applicable here, because Congress has made a decision

24

that a hearing should be held afterward, and the due

25

process clause does not invalidate that decision because

1

the employer is provided with notice and an opportunity

2

to respond, a

QUESTION;

Well, don't hang too much on

5

Congress.

6

didn't say what kind of a hearing, did it?

7

more said your kind than it said the kind

8

opponent proposes.?

9

Congress Just said a hearing.

HR.

FIMCUS:

Congress
Congress no
that your

Congress devised the procedure

10

whereby the hearing is held after the reinstatement of

11

the employee.

12

QUESTION;

13

HR.

14

That's right.

FINCUSs

It didn't specified an

evidentiary hearing at that time.

15

QUESTION;

It didn't specify it, but it didn't

16

say not, either.

17

Congress -- this is much more the Secretary's decision

18

than Congress' decision, isn't it, that we're disputing

19

here?

20

HR.

I mean, really you can't say that

EINCUS;

Well, Your Honor, no,

we

21

interpret the statute as being quite clear that at the

22

conclusion of the investigatory process that's when

23

reinstatement

24

starts afterwards, while the employee is back at work.

25

And we think that that's the determination that Congress

occurs, and that the adversary process

made
QUESTION;

2

Is that in the statute, the

3

Secretary is going to be giving hearings before

4

reinsta tement ?
MR. FINCUS:

5

We- think, that Congress''---

6

determination was that the hearing should be

7

post-reinstatement, not pre-reinstatement.
QUESTION:

8
9

So the answer is yes to my

question ?

10

MR.

FINCUS;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR.

Yes.
And why is this case not moot?

FINCUS;

Your Honor, we think that it

13

falls within the capable of repetition, yet evading

14

review exception we discuss in our reply brief.

15

is a big trucking company.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR.

Roadway

Yes.

FINCUS;

And just with respect tc

18

Appellee's investigatory-adjudicatory argument, we think

19

the Court's decision in Withrow against Larkin makes

20

clear that there's no due process problem in this case.

21

That's all I have, Your Honors.
