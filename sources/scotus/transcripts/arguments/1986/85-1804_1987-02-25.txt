BEHALF OF APPELLANT
Mr. Chief Justice and may it

the Court:

9

This is a so-called hybrid action by an

10

employee against his union and employer, against the

11

employer for breach of a collective bargaining and

12

against the union for mishandling a grievance which it

13

had the exclusive authority to prosecute.

DelCostello, the Court made a policy judgment that, as

2

compared to three or six-year limitation periods, which

3

is what were at issue in Mitchell and DelCostello, or a

4

thre month statute of limitations, also at issue in

5

Mitchell, a six month limitation period set forth for

unfair labor practice charges before the NLRB was the

7

most appropriate and therefore should be used as the

statute of limitations for DFR actions, duty of fair

10

What the Court did

not decide in DelCostello

11

was what had to be done within the six month period.

12

That is what is at issue in this case.

13

The case arose when Petitioner West was

discharged in November of 1981.

However, in March of 1984 West determined that

the anion had in fact abandoned his back pay claim.

Nov, had West sought to institute unfair labor practice

proceedings at the National Labor Relations Board, he

could have gone to the NLRB on the last day of the six

7

month limitation period.
He would have had to fill out a few blanks in

an administrative form which

we have set fcrth as the

10

last page of our brief.

The form would have been filed

11

and served on the same day, and service would have been

MR. LEVY:

But we do suggest that the things

that_have to be done in order to file a complaint are

3

greater than the things --

6

QUESTION:

Well, that's so, but the only one

that's relevant here is the service time.
MR. LEVY:

It is in part the only thing that

7

is relevant, although if in fact -- one of our arguments

8

is that if in fact the Court is going to borrow the

9

service requirement of Section 10(b) as well as the

10

limitations period, then the question will arise,

11

not borrow the other things that the board has said are

12

all that a charging party has to do in order to file an

13

unfair labor practice claim?

14

why

And we propose to draw a line, a clear line,

15

at the limitations period and not go on to the other

16

timeliness rules, including the service rule.

17

In any event, the complaint was filed within

18

the si* month period, but the summons and complaint were

19

not served until three weeks

20

on which the circuits are closely divided is is the suit

21

untimely on the ground that the service requirement in

22

Section 10(b) should be adopted to govern the case.

23

later.

And so the question

Now, in arguing that it should not, we rely

24

first on the normal rule for

25

and in stating the normal rule I recognize that this

federal question claims,

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Court has not dispositively decided the question.

2

virtually every lower court to address the question for

3

the past 40 years, as well as the court below, have

4

taken the view that the normal rule is that under Rule 3

5

filing the complaint satisfies the statute of

6

limitations in a federal question case in the district

7

court.
QUESTION’:

8
9

12

That’s not necessarily true in a

diversity case, is it?
HR.

10
11

But

LEVY:

That’s not true in a diversity

case.
We rely on the existence of a normal federal

13

rule for two reasons:

14

federal rule,

15

10(b), or indeed anywhere else, to fill a gap in federal

16

law, as the Court had to do to pick a limitations period

17

in DelCostello.

18

And

First, because there is a normal

it is not necessary to look to Section

second, because there is a rule,

19

Respondents who seek an exception from the rule bear

20

some sort of burden of showing that the exception is

21

justified, and we don't think that they have shown that

22

an exception is justified.

23

But even if Rule 3 does not control, we think

24

that the better rule is that filing alone is

25

sufficient.

After all, in DelCostello the Court decided
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that, given the policies and

2

litigation involved, a six month period was better than

3

a three or a six year period on the long end or a three

4

month period on the short end.

the practicalities of

Now, we recognize the consequence of choosing

5

6

either a filing rule or a service rule is that the

7

statute of limitations will not be exactly six months

8

for both sides.

9

plaintiff will be required to file in advance of six

If the Court requires service, then the

10

months; and if filing alone is sufficient, the defendant

11

will not learn of the suit for some time after six

12

months.

13

But we submit that the consequences of

adopting only

16

policies and practicalities involved than adopting the

17

whole package of NLRB timeliness rules.

QUESTION;

more consistent with the

Isn't one practicality that we

19

don't want to have to fight this thing out or have

20

circuit courts try to figure it out every time there's a

21

new borrowing of another statute?

22

apart from what might be the most equitable thing in

23

this particular case?

24
25

Isn't it desirable,

Isn't there some desirability of having a more
or less uniform rule?

wouldn't that be the rule of

LEVYj

borrowing the whole thing,

Precisely, and the uniform rule,

5

the traditional rule in the federal courts, is that

6

filing is sufficient to satisfy the statute of

7

limitations, rather than simply looking at each statute

8

of limitations and then trying to discern from the rules

9

adopted by the authority that adopted, that provides the

10

statute of limitations, whether service or indeed

11

something else is required.

MR.

LEVY:

The only case in which a service

rule has been borrowed is in

there the problem was that it would have been

inequitable.

19

on that cause of action, and to allow plaintiffs to come

20

into federal court when they could not come into state

satisfaction of the statute of limitations --

1

Court of Appeals and other courts, or virtually every

2

one, to consider the question has, even though a state

3

had a service rule as part of its statute of

4

limitations, the courts have borrowed only the

5

limitation period and not the service rule in federal

6

question cases.
Now, the anion draws a distinction.

7

It says

8

if the statute of limitations itself does not say

9

requires service, then it is appropriate not to borrow

10

the service requirement which is contained in some other

11

section.
And

12

I would agree that most states, when they

13

draft statutes of limitations, have a list of periods

14

and then perhaps a list of tolling rules, and then

15

another section which says this is what we mean by

16

satisfying the statute of limitations.

17

But surely, if it is inappropriate to borrow

18

the service requirement in those cases, the mere fact

19

that the service requirement appears in the same section

20

of the United

21

it's a borrowed section, shouldn’t make any difference,

we submit.

that we think,

given the advisory

rule seemed to think that the logical interpretation of

11

the rule, although they recognized that there was an

12

open question, that the logical interpretation of a rule

that says an action is commenced by the filing of the

14

complaint, means the statute of limitations is satisfied

15

in that context.

16

QUESTION;

Would that line of cases be

overruled if we borrowed the service requirement?

MR. LEVI;

You don't borrow unless you have

That's correct, for all DFR cases

what other kinds of labor cases are covered by

16

BelCostello and Section 10(b).

unfortunately they often do.

2

And yet, if satisfaction of the statute of

3

limitations depends on completion of service within the

4

limitations period, the effect is to push back by

5

several weeks the time in which a plaintiff must file

6

the complaint in order to be sure that his claim will be

heard.

4

because what is at issue is not simply a discharge, but

5

rather a grievance procedure and the union's failure to

procedure, which may linger for months or even, as this

case, years, as in this case years.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

2
3

MR.

GOLD;

Thank you, Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;

4

As Mr. Levy has indicated, in the DelCostello

5

case this Court held that the statute of limitations in

6

this type of case is the statute of limitations stated

7

in Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act as

8

amended.

9

That provision says that no complaint shall

10

issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring

11

more than six months prior to the filing of the charge

12

with the board and the service of a copy thereof upon

13

the person against whom such

14

charge is made.

In the words of Walker versus Armco, a

15

diversity case arising in a different context, to be

16

sure, of this Court in 446 U.S., this language seems to

17

us to plainly be a statement of a substantive decision

18

by the legislature that actual service on the defendants

19

is an integral part of the several policies served by

20

the statute.

21

There are various kinds of statutes of

22

limitations, and this appears to us to be an example of

23

one in which the tolling rule is one which not only

24

rests on filing, but also on providing notice, that

25

repose is served in that way.

my view, our view on that, is that the

what the interplay is between Rule 3 and various kinds

9

of statutes of limitation.

GOLD:

Given the entirely federal nature

And, contrary to Mr. Levy, we don’t believe

10
11

that there is a normal rule on that issue.

There is an

12

open question in this Court,

treated with and which in Walker was specifically

14

preserved, as to what the normal rule ought to be.

We also know that Rule 3 is not intended to

The point is, as far as we're

doesn't that amount to a judgment that,

we do is, you know, pick the six months or two years or

you're saying.

and in

general in discussing the borrowing process,

the Court

13

has said that it isn't — that the point of the matter

is, rather than engaging in judicial creativity to draw

15

on, because these matters are necessarily arbitrary to

16

some extent, you're saying thus far and no further and

how long the period of

You don't have a Rule 3 that sets forth

You do have a Rule

5
6

I mean, you've got to get tolling rules from

3 that sets forth, we think

or it's argued, a rule for when an action is commenced.
MR.

7

GOLD;

It is a rule for when an action is

8

commenced, but the very point of Ragan and Walker is

9

that, while it tells you whan the action is commenced,

10

it doesn't tell you when the statute of limitations is

11

tolled.

12

That was the precise point of the analysis in

13

Ragan and the precise point of the analysis in Walker.

14

And the question here really is whether in a borrowing

15

situation this kind of tolling, tolling where the

16

legislature says we want these people to have actual

17

notice, is different from other kinds of tolling rules.

18

I just find it hard, given the assigned

19

rationale of Rule 3,

20

about the date from which other time requirements in the

21

flow of litigation mean, to say that it is a rule which

22

ought to override a more specific legislative judgment

make when I was discussing the matter with Justice

2

Stevens is that it does make sense where all the

legislature has told you is that the plaintiff must

There is no conflict.

10

file, or commence a lawsuit within a

You're not running

against the grain of any legislative Judgment in such an
instance.

11

And interestingly enough, at least as we

12

understand their presentation, the plaintiffs concede

13

that if you have a federal statute of limitation which

14

is applicable to a certain cause of action in terms and

15

requires with regard to tolling service in terms, that

16

federal statute overrides Rule 3.

17

That's what we think we have here.

We have an

18

implied federal cause of action coming out of the

19

National Labor Relations Act and the Railroad Labor

20

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. GOLD i

So they're both --

2

QUESTION;

Same statute of limitations?

3

MR.

Correct.

GOLD;

And we're saying that the

4

Court has said to that complex of an express and an

5

implied cause of action that there is a federal statute

6

of limitations which Congress has devised and which

7

applies in this situation.

8

So as far as we’re concerned, Congress is the

9

lawgiver in both regards, and the Court says that these

10

two pieces fit together, and

11

says, and this borrowed federal statute of limitations

12

is, we submit, in form the kind of statute of

13

limitations which embodies the substantive judgment of

14

actual notice.

15

that is what DelCostello

And it seems to us that to say that if

16

Congress had added to 301 in

17

of actual notice,

18

it is this process of drawing implications from the

19

totality of what Congress has done that applies here,

20

that Rule 3 does override it doesn't make any sense.

21

so many words a requirement

then Rule 3 wouldn't apply, but since

The point is that Rule 3 can help you where

22

the legislature hasn't told you anything very much, but

23

that its basic purpose is not to state the tolling rule

24

or the form of notice that tolls a statute of

25

limitation, but to set up a sequence of various time
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1
2

limits if you have a proper and timely cause of action.
And just in our judgment, given the basic

3

theory of borrowing statute of limitations, which is

4

that, instead of engaging, in this Court’s words in

5

Johnson versus Railway Express, in judicial creativity,

6

but rather to look, to what the legislature has done and

7

to try to follow the lines that the legislature has

8

indicated, that it makes sense to distinguish between a

9

statute of limitations which is applicable in terms and

10

the statute of limitations where it is a federal statute

11

of limitations that this Court determines is the one

12

that is intended to apply.

13

Now, there are a variety, it seems to us, of

14

federal question cases, and I simply want to note that

15

we have touched on several of them thus far, but there

16

are other kinds as well, where the Court determines to

17

borrow a state statute of limitations.

18

There may be situations — and indeed, the

19

case that the Petitioners put heaviest reliance on,

20

Bomar versus Keyes, which is a Learned Hand opinion in

21

the Second Circuit, is an example of this.

22

situations where there’s a statute, a state statute of

23

limitations which is borrowed, and there is also a state

24

procedural rule passed to govern the state courts.

25

the Second Circuit said you weren't going to borrow that

And at least in that kind of borrowing, our

position is that where the legislative judgment on when
