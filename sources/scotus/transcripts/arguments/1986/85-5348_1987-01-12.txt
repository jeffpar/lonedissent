We bring these facts to the Court's attention

MR.

21

McNALLY;

In this case we contend that

that happened.

In general,

we're contending that jurors

23

who are picked in this manner are uncommonly punitive,

24

that is, they are more punitive as a whole than a jury

which is picked for an ordinary criminal case, based on

And your point goes to guilt or

innocence?

MR. McNALLY;

If pushed, we would

talk about

the whole question that was

needn’t go that far.

8

10

before the court last year

Our position here is that we

Because obviusly there — McCree rejected or
apparently expressed skepticism about some of those
things .

11

We basically make the same argument that was

12

made in Witherspoon.

And in Witherspoon, there was

13

fragmentary evidence,

and the court said it is

14

self-evident that a jury picked in this manner is

15

uncommonly inclined to impose the maximum sentence, in

16

that case the death penalty.

17

We're making the same argument, that this jury

18

was uncommonly inclined to impose, as they did, the

19

maximum sentence.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. McNally, exactly what relief

21

did the defendant ask for in a timely fashion at the

22

trial?

23
24
25

MR. McNALLY:

Separate juries, for example.

I

believe there was a discussion of -- and I’m not sure -QUESTION:

Do you know what it is the

MB. McNALLY:

of course in

5

It's right in the appendix, and

the briefs we discuss it.

QUESTION:

And

what was that?

A separate

sentencing jury?

6

MR. McNALLY:

Separate sentencing jury.

In

7

other words, in -- Mr. Hectus asked for that and said,

8

we'll have the trial, and we'll decide guilt and

9

innocence for both defendants, and we'll decide

10

punishment for my client.

And then a separate jury

11

could be empanelled to decide the penalty for the

12

capital defendant Kevin Stanford.
Now that would be cheaper than a separate

13
14

trial.

15

Death qualification, for example, after the guilt phase.

16

There were other remedies that were discussed.

And of my own independent recollection, I'm

17

not sure which of the seven

remedies we talk about in

MR. McNALLY:

The capital defendant?
Certainly.

And why is that?
The State has -- because that

person is a capital defendant, and because the State has

a legitimate interest in trying one defendant before one

situation.

There’s a second question Involved in this
case, and that deals with the introduction of

10

psychological evidence in rebuttal of David Buchanan's

11

claim that he had suffered from an extreme emotional

12

disturbance at the time of the murder.

13

What vs had here was a series of,

first, three

14

psychological examinations that had taken place before

15

the murder, one as long as six or seven months

16

beforehand.

17

those exams to support his claim that he had suffered

18

from the emotional disturbance.

19

And

Mr. Buchanan relied on the results of

What he complains about is that the prosecutor

20

in this case used a fourth examination that had been

21

conducted some seven months after the murder spree to

22

rebut his claim.

23

He argues that this violated his Fifth

24

Amendment privilege against

as his Sixth

self-incriminat ion, as well

Amendment right to counsel.

And he bases

these claims squarely upon this Court's holding in

Now, in that case, the Court held that where

And finally, the examiner in this case we

not.

that the government had to prove in its case.

3

And perhaps here I should point out that the

and so the jury did not hear about that.

13

What we are --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Mr. Smith, is emotional disturbance

a defense to the offense under Kentucky law?
MR. SMITH:

It is

a mitigating, affirmative

17

defense. The

18

extreme emotional disturbance, first of all, that

19

applies only to an intentional theory of murder.

20

— when the defendant suffers from an

The only effect this would have would be to

21

reduce the charge down from

which is punishable by a lesser penalty range.

23

What we're asking

murder to manslaughter,

the Court to do in this case

24

is to expressly hold what we think was given tacit

25

approval to in the Estelle opinion.
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And the rule that we would urge, therefore, is

2

that whereas here the defendant reguests the

3

examination,

4

into the case, that the government can then compel him

5

to undergo further examination in order to test the

6

validity of the claim that he is making.

7

and then the defendant injects the issue

And the rationale for the rule that we urge

8

here is that in a very real

9

situation is testifying through his expert witness about

10

sense the defendant in that

information that is known only to him.

11

And as this Court noted in Estelle, under that

12

circumstance, his silence could deprive the government

13

of the only effective means by which it cculd test and

14

verify the validity of that claim.

15

We respectfully submit that the Fifth

16

Amendment privilege against

18

self-incriminat ion should

We think that this situation is analogous to

19

where a criminal defendant takes the witness stand at

20

trial, and then he does not care to undergo

21

cross-examination.

22

so.

23

Clearly, he can be required to do

And so under the rule we're urging here, we

24

submit that the prosecutor in this case could have asked

25

that the trial be stopped after Mr. Buchanan had

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

could have asked that he be

Instead, what he did was simply employ a much

5

less intrusive method.

He used information that was

And as far as his Sixth Amendment clai m is

concerned, he claims he was denied the right to counsel,

record shows

that he did have an opportunity to consult

extreme emotional disturbance into the case.
Lastly, we would submit that if the Co urt does

16

find a Fifth

or Sixth Amendment constitutional v iolation

17

here, that it would apply only to the murder cha rge, not

18
