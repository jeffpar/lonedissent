Thanh you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
I concluded my remarks this morning with a

11

discussion of the function that notice would provide if

12

13

an employer who is clearly liable for the tax receives

14

greater procedural protection than the lender does,

inasmuch as the lender receives no notice and yet is

subject to being sued by the Government for collection

17

of the tax for nine years after the employer’s liability

That’s correct.

MR. FLAYHART:

No, Your Honor.

If I can

8

explain, we are not here asking any different statute cf

9

10

the Government had brought suit against Jersey Shore

11

within three years of the employer’s tax liability

12

having arisen, we would not contest that fact.

13

If

What we are saying is that once the assessment

has been been, then that triggers the notice provision

of that is that notice having teen given.

As I say, we are not requesting a different

18

statute of limitations period than would be applicable

19

to the employer.

2

If the employer had not received notice after the

21

assessment had been made, then the Government likewise

22

would be precluded from suing the employer as well.

The employer is entitled tc notice.

No.

QUESTION!

5

I see what you're saying.

You're

6

saying that, even against the employer, once you make an

have proceeded against the employer without making an

HR. FLAYHART;

If you do

MR. FLAYHART;

QUESTION;

16

Without having provided --

-- without having provided notice.

Why would that be?
MR. FLAYHART;

17

Well, that's under Section

18

6303(a), and

that of course is the issue which is before

19

the Court.

20

here seemed tc justify the lack of notice to the lender

21

on the basis that on the substantive grounds that actual

22

notice or knowledge under Section 3505 of the Code was

23

required to be shown on the part of -- by the

24

Government, in order to foist liability on the lender

for this tax.

MR. FLAYHARTi

the purposes of the facts of this case, of course, all

of the period of time that the Government seeks to

the further point, whether, even though without the

6

giving of notice you could have been sued within the

9

Do you think that you have adequately preserved

MR. FLAYHART:

Yes, we do, because of the

issue of the notice.

11

crucial to this, the entire issue.

MR. FLAYHART:

Well, not to belabor the point,

16

but the reason that we didn’t is because we are not

requesting any different period of statute cf

19

-- you see, the Ninth Circuit in the Hunter Engineers

went off oh this point, and

We raised it in the context of the notice

The Third

5

No, we didn’t raise it in that

Circuit, however, in its majority-

6

opinion seemed to justify this differing treatment

7

that’s being afforded to a lender as opposed to an

8

employer on the basis of the notice requirement

9

contained in Section 3505 itself.

In ether words, the

10

Third Circuit said that a lender cannot be held liable

11

unless the Government can preve actual notice or

12

knowledge that the employer had not paid its employee

13

withholding taxes or that the funds were supplied by the

14

lender to the employer with knowledge that the employer

15

would not pay those taxes.
However, this distinction, as noted by the

16
17

Messina Builders case in the Eighth Circuit, is

18

inapplicable because of the fact that actual notice or

19

knowledge under Section 3505 is a defined term which

20

includes within it the definition contained

21

6323 of the Code, which can indeed mean lack of due

22

diligence.

23

in Section

Therefore, a lender can be held liable under

Section 3505(b) not only cn

the basis of actual notice

25

or knowledge, but on the basis that the lender failed to

fact that the employee taxes had not been paid.
With regard to the legislative history of

Section 3505, there is nothing to shew in that history

cr the Congressional reports that Congress in creating a

6

new class of persons who were liable for this tax on a

7

derivative basis, that is to say lenders, intended to

8

exempt the Government from providing the notice required

9

under Section 5303(a) to persons liable for the tax.
It must be presumed, we would urge, that

10
11

Congress does not legislate in a vacuum.

12

had intended

13

notice and had intended to afford the Government the

14

right to that exemption, then it would have changed the

cf an assessment followed by a demand also establishes a

lien on the taxpayer's property.

3

And the only way the taxpayer can deal with an

assessment, really, is by paying the tax and then filing

5

the refund suit, in which case the burden is then on the

taxpayer to prcve an entitlement to a refund.

of this, there is a preference for the Commissioner to

lender is not subject to the tax> he is subject to
liability, to a separate liability created by Section
3 515 .
In fact, as I mentioned earlier, Section 3505
liability is not assessable.

It probably would be

assessable if Congress had established it as a tax,
because all taxes are assessable.

Sc this, the fact

that Congress set it up this way, redounds to the
benefit of the lenders because it immunizes them from
these administrative collection procedures and requires
the Government to resort to

judicial action in order to

collect this liability.

taxes were personally paid, that would be the lender's

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

One, this

1

notice that they're asking for tells them nothing that

2

they don’t already know.

3

The only purpose I think that Petitioner adverted to in

4

his argument is this notion of extendina the statute of

6

It doesn't serve any purpose.

Putting that aside for a moment, certainly

8

the employer doesn't tell the lender anything, because

9

there is this scienter requirement in the statute.

They

10

can only be held liable under Section 3505 if they have

11

actual notice that withholding taxes have net been paid

12

by the employer.

13

And the amount, as has been discussed before,

14

the amount that is on the notice of assessment to the

15

employer, doesn't mean anything to the bank.

16

17

Nor does sending it at copy suggest that the

18

Government is planning to sue the bank.

19

be sending it a copy.

20

It doesn't

It would just

And the other serious problem here is that the

21

interpretation sought by Petitioner would completely

22

eliminate 3505(a) from the Code, because there's just no

23

way that the IRS can know at the time it makes these

24

assessments,

25

of the time the withholding tax return is filed,

which is usually within a couple of months

there is a lender, whether the lender might arguably be

So I do think that Petitioner’s contention

here makes absolutely no sense within the structure of

the Code.

has really is the plain meaning of the statute, and that

7

is the argument that the other Court of Appeals have

and some of the other courts have recognized that the

Government’s position makes more sense, but they have

found themselves to be bound by the plain meaning.

plain meaning of the statute, because I think even

14

looking at 6303(a) alone, without considering its impact

on the rest of the Code, the plain meaning in fact does

16

support the Government’s reading cf it.

And the only way he can contest that liability

The bank is in a very different position.

15

Sending a copy of this to the bank, even assuming it had

So I do think that sending the notice to the

The Code sets up two different statutes of

That's

The normal course of business -- and the

bank I don’t think can deny

this -- in almost every

case, since assessments are routinely sent out when
withholding tax is not paid, there is goino to be an
assessment made and there is then going to be a six year
statute of limitations on the collection.
That will apply to the employer, that will

And there is no reason for the tank

to think that the statute is going to be anything less.
So this isn't a situation where the bank has —

therefore has the right to the same statute of

entitled to the same statute of limitations, so

QUESTION*

What if notice of assessment had

7

not been given to the employer?

Would you acknowledge

8

that then suit could not have been brought, after three

9

years against either the employer or the tank?

10

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes.

11

I guess one ether point I should make on the

12

statute of limitations is that the bank -- there's

13

really no reason for the bank to be thinking of a three

14

year statute, aside from the general practice of the

15

IRS.
If the bank is as ignorant of what’s going cn

16
17

with the employer as it's trying to make itself out to

18

be, it wouldn’t even know that the employer had filed a

19

withholding tax return.

20

employe-r: wouldn’t file a return at all, and the three

21

year statute cnly runs from the time the return is

22

filed.

It's quite possible that the

So if the employer doesn’t file a return,

23
24

there’s no statute of limitations running at all at any

25

time.

So I don't think there's any reason for the tank

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONEE!

1

MR. FLAYHART:

2

We would just like to address

3

two points, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

counsel for the Government seems to indicate that the

5

notice that is given to the employer of the assessment,

6

that we would urge to be given to the lender, doesn’t

7

tell the lender already something that it doesn’t know.
Well, of course the first response to that is,

8
9

The first is that

well, what does the notice tell the employer?

Certainly

10

the employer already knows that he’s liable for the tax

11

because he’s

12

the money .

filed the return and indicates that he owes

13

Secondly --

14

QUESTION!

It tells him that the Government's

15

about to come and garnish his -- you know, attach his

16

proper ty .
MR. FLAYHART;

17

That’s right, and that the tax

18

is due and the Government agent's going to be there

19

within a period of time.
QUESTION;

20

Up to that amount.

21

something important for him

22

have to know that, because it can’t happen to the

23

lender .

24
25

MR. FLAYHART;

to know.

That’s

The lender doesn’t

Except for the fact that it

also tells the lender that the Government’s going to be

there up to nine years later , about to do likewise in

terms of foisting liability on the lender for these same

3

taxes.

4

dcesn't.

The employer gets the notice, the lender

QUESTION:

5

Well, that's a different point.

6

That shows why it would be useful to the lender, but it

7

doesn't show that it would be useful to the lender for

8

the same reason that it would be useful tc the

9

employer.
HR. FLAYHART;

10

Well, we wouldn't quibble with

11

that.

I mean, I think the point is that it's useful to

12

both parties and therefore is required to be given to

13

both parties.
QUESTION:

14
15

What statutory provision do you say

sets the limitations period

against the lender?

16

MR. FLAYHART:

It would be 6501 and 6502.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FLAYHART:

19

If there are no other questions from the

6501 and 2.
Yes.

Court, I conclude my presentation.
