Mr. Roberts, are you asking

that we

cut back on Rhode Island against Innis?
MR. ROBERTS:

Mo,

Your Honor.

I am simply

saying that the standard you enunciated there does not

apply to the facts of this case.

Your Honor, because whether

2

or not it was interrogation

is a question of law, and I

am submitting that as a question of law the Arizona

Supreme Court was wrong.

there was a "but-for" test,

what the Arizona Supreme Court has applied here.

11

older brother in the cell with me and knowing when thev

12

put him there that he was going to try to persuade me to

Well, Kelly Church was successful.

14

His

brother later asked for a pencil and paper and wrote out

a confession.

her speak to he defendant so that it wasn't obvious to
the defendant?

remained the same?
QUESTION!

you think the result would be any different?
NS. ROBERTS;

I don't believe it would. Your

Honor, because still there is no official police
conduct.

There is no compulsion that is required under

Innis.
As a matter of fact, this Court recently
decided a case, not precisely on point but similar in
some respects, the name of the case,

I am sorry —

Kuhlman, Kuhlman versus Wilson where Hr. Wilson was
placed in the cell of an informant, Bennie Lee.
Now, the police had told Lee, now just listen,
don't try to stimulate conversation about what he has
been charged with, just listen.

And this Court upheld

the admission of statements that Wilson made to Lee on
that basis, and of course that was surreptitious.
I mean, Wilson didn't know that Lee was a
government informant and he certainly didn't know he was

of this case.

10

But those aren't the circumstances

The Arizona Supreme Court further held, and we

11

submit most erroneously, that the State could not even

12

use this brief tape in rebuttal, and in so doing it

13

relied upon this Court's holding in Wainwright versus

14

Greenfield.

15

this tape was used only in rebuttal.

16

We submit that was grievous error because

The trial court's findings, which

I urge you

17

to scrutinize, are at pages 216 through 220 of the joint

18

appendices, and he made very complete and specific

19

findings on all of these matters.

20

that -- well, first let me set the stage.

21

The trial court held

Let me tell you what defense counsel had done

22

in building the insanity defense.

First of all, this

23

tape was not needed and certainly was not used to prove

24

that Mr. Kauro comnitted the murder.

25

to numerous people at a Circle-K shortly after he had

He admitted that

done it
It wasn't needed to prove the act.

2

All it was

3

needed for was to show his cental state to rebut his

4

insanity defense.

5

put on the stand Bruce Griffin, a defense attorney, who

6

say Sr. Mauro the day of the murder, November 23rd,

7

1982, but ha

8

talked with his wife, later in the day.

Everything the defense counsel presented on

10

the day of the murder, so far as the conversations, or

11

later in the day after the tape between Mauro and his

12

wife.

13

but fairly, as a salivating or slobbering catatonic

14

madman.

Mr. Griffin described Mr. Mauro, and

I summarize

That was the gist of his description.
Then, relying upon their psychiatrist,

15

the

16

defense psychiatrist, Dean Gerstenburger, Mr.

17

Gerstenburger also observed Mauro later in the day, even

18

later than Mr. Griffin observed him.

19

in a good many hearsay statements from Mr. Mauro in his

20

response.

Gerstenburger got

But more important than that, Gerstenburger

21

22

relied upon a tape recording, Exhibit 172, which was

23

admitted at defense counsel's request, a tape recording

24

between another defense attorney, Donald Bayliss, and

25

Mr. Mauro.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Now, Your honors, what is so important to

1

2

realize about this, and I know you have either heard the

3

tape or you will, is when you hear Mr. Bayliss asking

4

Mr. Mauro questions, and this is on the day of the

5

murder but later than the conversation between Mauro and

6

his wife, when you hear Bayliss asking him questions

7

what you hear in response from Mauro, and that's why

8

defense counsel wanted it before the jury, is

9

unintelligible animal-like sounds more similar to

10

grunting and

moans than anything else, thus portraying

11

him to the jury as an incoherent, irrational person

12

sounding more like an animal than anything else.
QUESTION;

13

Mr. Roberts, let me ask you

14

something.

Do you think the Arizona court initially

15

decided this case on the basis of the Fifth Amendment?
MR. ROBERTS;

16

Oh,

they initially and

17

exclusively decided this case on the basis of the Fifth

18

Amendment.

19

QUESTION;

Say it again?

20

MR. ROBERTS;

They initially and exclusively

21

decided this case on the basis of the Fifth Amendment

22

and ths Court's holding.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, then isn't all the talk about

the Sixth Amendment in Greenholtz just pure dicta?
MR. ROBERTS;

QUESTION:

They relied upon this Court's

I can't get away from the fact that

13

this is just a pure factual application of the Innis

14

case, and all your talk about Greenfield and the Sixth

15

Amendment is rather by the way.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, Your Honor, I agree with

17

you that it should be decided and reversed on the basis

18

that there was no interrogation.

19

am saying is, if the Court disagrees with that, our

20

position is that it was not fundamentally unfair to

21

allow the prosecutor to use this brief exchange between

22

Mauro and his wife to show several things.

23

reason we present that argument also.

I agree.

But what I

That is the

24

The trial court found it was probative, the

25

most probative and relevant thing that the prosecutor

1

2

please let me apprise you of those.

3

showed more plainly than anything else that prosecution

4

could present Mauro's state of mind closest to the time

5

he committed

Number one, it

the murder.

The tape between Mauro and his wife was the

6
7

closest thing to the time he committed the murder.

8

Defense counsel, in a lengthy cross examination of Linda

9

Mauro who was on the stand at least three days, had also

10

through that examination and through eight pages he

11

devoted in closing argument, attempted to portray her to

12

the jury as being at least partially, if not wholly

13

responsible for the child's brutal murder by suffocation.
Having done that,

14

the trial court concluded,

15

it was legitimate and not fundamentally unfair to allow

16

the prosecutor to let the jury hear the tape where they

17

could hear Mauro* s voice, judge for themselves his

18

thinking, his intimations, his pauses, and hear his

19

wife's voice because of the accusations and implications

20

that defense counsel had been making against her.
It was a most effective thing.

did in his case in chief, incidentally.

M3. ROBERTS:

We have also cited to this Court

6

the case of Nichols versus Wainwright, and there the

7

Eleventh Circuit did not find it impermissible for the

8

prosecutor to use as impeachment a statement that the

9

defendant made one-half hour after his arrest.

Now, at

10

the time of his arrest Nichols had invoked his Miranda

11

rights, right to remain silent, the right to have

12

counsel.
He invoked that, but a half-hour later he made

13
14

a statement saying that he did what he did because of

15

duress.

16

Mauro did not take the stand.

17

was able to get in that testimony though another

18

testified that Mauc o fluctuated in and out, in and out

himself?

4

MS. WkLSH;

No, because I think as this Court

5

has mentioned, there is contact between a defendant and

6

police, jailers, at all times, that that could produce

that kind of conversation.

QUESTION:

So then, what’s wrong with what

I mean, what was introduced

was not that

10

he blurted out, "Yes, I did it," and they are

11

introducing that at the trial.

12

introducing is the fact that the man was rational.

"Yes, I did it.

The only thing they are

First of all, he did blurt out,

You tried as best you can to stop me."

QUESTION;

Right,

but that wasn't the purpose

for which it was allowed to be introduced?
MS. W?.LSU :

No, it was not.

It was introduced

18

in order to rebut the insanity defense.

19

all it is up to the prosecution to prove sanity beyond a

20

reasonable doubt.

21

QUESTION;

But first of

So, any demonstration of sanitv

22

while he is at the police station constitutes

23

incrimination and the police cannot do anything to him

24

or with him while he is at the station that might let

25

him show that he is sane?

That’s rather an extreme

2

position, isn’t it?
MS. WA.LSH ;

That would be an extreme position,

3

but I think that what happens here is that the police

4

officers brought the husband and the wife together

5

specifically to create a situation where incriminating

6

statements might be made, and it —

7

QUESTION:

I wouli agree with you if they

8

tried to introduce it to show that he said he had

9

committed it, yes.

10
11

But all they are introducing it for

is to show that he was sane, that’s all.
MS. WALSH;

I think the problem with that is

12

that if you give the fact that these are Miranda

13

violative statements, you can’t say that Miranda is --

14

that if you have a Miranda violative situation and you

15

raise the insanity defense, you waive your Miranda

16

rights or any other rights orotected by the Constitution.

17

What you would be saying is that, of course

18

they couldn't introduce these statements otherwise, but

19

if you invoke the insanity defense then indeed you are

20

waiving your right to exclude Miranda violative

21

statements.

22

result and an unfair burden to legitimate criminal

23

defendants who raise the insanity defense legitimately,

24

as it was in this case.

25

I wouli submit that that would be an unfair

QUESTION:

Well, you then have to be very

You can*t talk to him about anything.

QUESTION;

I don't think -Because as you say, it's not just

6

the recording of it.

7

shouldn't be able to testify that the man seemed to be

8

rational.

You

You really have to keep him incommunicado.
MS. WALSH;

9

The recorder didn't matter.

I think the Arizona Supreme Court

10

addressed that issue.

I think that they can testify as

11

to behavior, but they cannot provoke a situation, as

12

they did here, by putting the husband and the wife

13

togeth er.
Granted, it was Linda Mauro's idea, but I

14
15

don’t think -- you know, they can still testify as to

16

behavior .

17

QUESTION;

It doesn't make any sense to talk

18

about provoking a demonstration of rationality.

19

provoke a confession, yes, I committed the crime.

20

here you are talking about provoking a demonstration of

21

rationality and that seems to me a very strange concept.

22

MS. WALSH;

One can
But

I don’t think -- they were not

23

provoking rationality, per se, but they were attempting

24

to get anything they could to use against this guy or

25

his wife in the prosecution, and they introduced it and
37

there were incriminating statements as far as committing

2

a crime.

3

They introduced it in -order to show sanity.

4

The thing of it is -- and there is a little bit of a

5

problem with the reason they did it.

6

or at this point they attempt to — the State attempts

7

to raise an argument that because an attorney testified

8

as to behavior, and because a tape was admitted, that

another attorney, defense attorney, took between the

10

waiver which allowed --

12

QUESTION!

Supposing that I am — let's take

13

this in a classic Fifth Amendment context.

Supposing I

14

am called before a Committee of Congress and they begin

15

to interrogate me, and they say, "What’s your name,” and

16

I say, "I decline to testify on the ground that it might

incriminate me."

says, "Well,

something actually incriminating."

permissible basis for invoking the Fifth

QUESTION:

1

Why does it make any difference

2

here then, if Miranda is designed to secure the Fifth

3

Amendment rights?
MS. WALSH:

4

I think that what the Arizona

5

Supreme Court is trying to say is, they do not approve

6

of the behavior of the police department and they are

7

not going to be allowed to introduce this tape into

8

evidence .
QUESTION:

9

Well, that's perfectly permissible,

10

if they want to say that as a matter of Arizona law.

11

3ut what they did here, they said the federal

12

constitution prevents them from doing it.

13

not enough just that the Supreme Court of Arizona

14

doesn't approve of the behavior of the police

15

department, to sustain a federal constitutional

16

challenge.

17

MS. WALSH:

I mean, it*s

I think what the Arizona Supreme

18

Court is saying is that if you have a violation of the

19

federal constitution, if you have a Fifth Amendment

20

violation as they hold here, then you cannot turn around

21

and introduce it through the back door because the

22

insanity defense is raised.

23

And what they are saying is that there is not

24

going to be a situation where if you 'invoke or raise the

25

insanity defense you are going to give up your Miranda

rights, because the evidence would not have been allowed

2

to show that the man committed the crime, assuming a

3

Fifth Amendment violation.

4

What they say is they are not going to

5

back-door it, because there are incriminating statements

6

on there that he did commit the crime.

7

by the police department in what the Arizona Supreme

8

Court held to be impermissible conduct.

QUESTION:

And it was taken

I take it if the wife came to visit

10

her husband and the police said, fine, go ahead, and no

11

policeman was present, no recording device, and the lady-

12

talked with her husband and came back and then she said,

13

"I want to tell you what my husband said," and she told

14

them and it was guite incriminating,

15

"Sure, I’ll testify

16

Miranda rights, just because the police permitted the

17

wife to talk?

18

to it,"

MS. WALSH:

and she says,

would that be a violation of

No, I don’t think you could say

19

that that would be a violation of the Miranda rights,

20

and I think under that situation, assuming there was no

QUESTION;

Even though the police let the lady

23

in and they gave her permission and they thought to

24

themselves, well, he may make some incriminating

25

statements and she may tell us?
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think we are getting a little

MS. 8HLSH

remote in time for something like that.

Hather than the

police going in with her, that —
QUESTION!

So, it’s the police presence, is

that it?
MS. WALSH;

I believe it’s the police presence

that the Arizona Supreme Coart was condemning.
QUESTION;

Well, is there anything in our

cases that indicates that that should -- that the case
should turn on that kind of a factor?
MS. WALSH;
O’Connor.

I

I don’t believe so, Justice

think the case should turn on the fact that

this was found to be the functional equivalent of
custodial interrogation, and it should also turn on the
fact that, assuming the Fifth Amendment violation, you
cannot then introduce the tape into evidence.
QUESTION;

Well, I am more interested in

whether there is a Fifth Amendment violation at all, and
I don’t see that there is.

I’m trying to understand

from you what mates it a Fifth Amendment violation.
MS. WALSH;

The Fifth Amendment violation

comes from the fact that — and I think the Supreme
Court of Arizona pointed it out -- if Linda Mauro had
not asked to go in and see her husband, the police could
not have gone in and taped statements made in that

situation.

They could not interrogate him.
But what they did

2

was, they put her in there

3

and while she was not an agent of the police she was

4

certainly the motivating factor that prompted him to

5

make incriminating statements.
QUESTION;

6

Well, they granted the defendant's

7

wife’s reguest to talk to him?

8

MS. WALSH:

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes.
And sat there in plain view while

she did so?

11

MS. WALSH:

12

QUESTION;

13

MS. WALSH;

Yes.
And you say that is coercion?
I say that under the circuinstances

14

of this case, that was coercive behavior, but if you

15

take that tack, there is no appropriate waiver under

16

Edwards.

17

of contact from the defendant, and you need --

18

Under Edwards you need some kind of initiation

QUESTION;

In other words, you think that

19

Edwards means that the police could not permit the wife

20

to see him?

21

MS. WALSH;

I think that once counsel -- the

22

right to counsel had been invoked, as it had in this

case, then the police could

This was beknownst to the husband.

MS. WALSH:

Not until she walked in.

He had

no say-so as to whether or not he could see his wife.
He is sitting there.

They walk in, the wife, the police

officer, and the tape recorder.
She is hysterical and she is sobbing and she
is crying.

And she’s blurting out things and he’s

blurting out things.

And I think under an Edwards

analysis, no, you would not have the appropriate -- and
what has not been lone in thss case is to completely
analyze the whole situation as under Edwards, not only
as to initiation but as to the voluntariness.
First of all, you

know, was it a free choice,

and second of all, did he understand the consequences of
what was going on when his wife walks in with a police
officer, and

that would get into his mental state as

Did he ask to see his wife?

Did he

ask to see his wife?
M3. WALSH:
QUESTION:

No, he did not.
Well, I thought the Attorney

General said he did.
MS. WALSH:

I believe that the testimony --

and there was a brief statement by the trial court judge
that they both knew, but I believe that the testimony

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was, the consultation between Detective Manson and Linda

2

Mauro did not include any statements to Bill Kauro by

3

either Detective Manson or Sergeant Allen or Captain

4

Latham, or anybody there that he would be -- that he

5

knew that the wife was coming in.

6

And while the trial judge did make an

7

offhanded comment about -- that he knew, I think that

8

the testimony, if you go through the testimony of the

9

police officers, there was no indication that he knew

10
11

that his wife was coming in.
QUESTION:

Ms. Walsh, let me just see if I

12

understand your theory.

13

invoked his right to counsel, and under Edwards the

14

police cannot initiate interrogation, and so that if the

15

police officer had walked in unannounced with the wife

16

and said to the man, "Will you please tell your wife

17

everything I’ve been asking you," that would have been

18

clearly impermissible.

19

You are saying that he had

Or if he had said, "I hope you'll talk to your

20

wife while I

sit here and listen," that would be closer,

21

and you are saying it is just the functional equivalent

22

if he just walks in and just sits down and listens, that

23

they all boil down to the same thing?

24

position, I take it.

25

MS. WALSH:

That is your

My position is that, yes, it would

be the functional equivalent and that there would be no

2

appropriate waiver.

3

QUESTION:

4

he implicitly says,

5

as if he says, "Please do"?

6

It’s just as much interrogation if
"I’d like you to talk to this lady,"

MS. RALSH;

That’s right.

The police officers

7

testified that basically what they went in there to do

8

was find out what was going on, and I think it’s also

9

important to remember that it was possible to get the

10

husband and the wife together and take care of the

11

problem of escape by allowing — and take care of the

12

problem of her safety by allowing them, if that’s what

13

their motives were,

14

to speak in the jail facilities.

There was testimony that they could have --

15

and then everybody knew that they were getting ready to

16

take Bill Mauro over to the

17

facilities there that they could have allowed Bill and

18

Linda to talk together, if that’s what they had so

19

desired to do.

20

The fact of

evidence, to see what they could gat

2

I would submit that that, in and of itself,

3

shows that the activity by the police department that

4

was so condemned by the Arizona Supreme Court amounted

5

to the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation

6

under Rhode Island versus Innis, that the intent of the

7

police officers by their own testimony was so clear, and

8

what the Arizona Supreme Court was saying was, that

9

activity is going to be condemned.

I think, that the Arizona Supreme Court also

12

said that just because you invoke the insanity defense,

13

we are not going to make an exception for you.

14

not going to hold that your Miranda rights, even though

15

they may have been violated, are going to -- the fruits

16

of the evidence drawn from that are not going to be

17

18

you invoked the insanity defense.

I think for those reasons the Arizona Supreme

19

20

Court was correct in finding that this was the

functional equivalent of custodial interrogation and

22

that the tape was correctly held to be suppressed by

that Court.

That was the basis of the

Because what?
That was the basis of the

Arizona Supreme Court's decision, not Edwards.

But the other point I was going

Linda Mauro and her husband, that they were being
