How can people of this tyre afford

MR. CLOSE:

Well,

the problem with that -- the

answer to that is not in the record.

The dispute begins in April of

"Blew up" is their phrase.

version of the facts -- and

we have to accept that for purpose of today's argument
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

is that they would go out and look in the local

2

junkyards for a replacement engine, and that Eano Buick

3

was not supposed to do anything until the Conways had

4

found the engine that they wanted put back into the 1973

5

Opel, which was the faulty car.
Now, Nr. Conway, Jeff Conway, went out and

6
7

found engines, looked

8

apparently, when he found the engine that he said should

9

be put into the car, he called up 3ano Buick and said,

10

-- scoured the area.

hey, I've got the engine.
Well, 3ano Buick then said, oh, glad you

11
12

called.

13

like you to come down and pick it up.

16

We're just about to start your car.

And we’d

Apparently, he says, what are you talking

And

about?

I haven't authorized it.
Well, anyway, he and Mrs. Conway come down.

17

They get to the -- they get to the car dealership, and

18

they see in the car what they say -- and we have to

19

accept this as true also for purposes of today — they

20

saw a junk engine that he had seen in another Croton

21

Falls junkyard, and he had turned that engine down

22

because he didn't think it was a good enough engine to

23

put in the car.

24
25

So whatever argument they had,

their version

of the dispute is that -- which they swear to — is that

Whatever it was, they couldn't reach a

23

settlement then of this dispute, as to whether the check

24

would be honored, or what Banos would do cn it.

apparently the Banos went to my client, who is the

2

village justice and also a local lawyer, and they

3

brought the check to him.

4

third-hand in the record, as he said to us, look, the

first — the bounced check is a criminal whatever, and

the subsequent stop payment has got nothing to do with

it, because it's after the check.

I would have thought that advice was correct

in this case?

And such advice which is

How soon are you going to get to

the Constitutional point about a check that bounced?

us that under New York law the respondent 's arrest is

Is that right?
MR. CLOSE:

You concede that that’s true?
Well,

She has an actual

So she had the —

QUESTION:

Well, if you'd answer my question,

8

apparently what the respondents tell us is that New York

9

law would give a cause of action for malicious

10

prosecution for the making of an arrest without a

11

warrant and lacking in probable cause.

12

MR. CLOSE:

No, she’s wrong to the extent that

13

she’s suggesting that she can recover damages for the

14

false arrest as part of her malicious prosecution claim.
We — we -- I cite in my reply brief all the

15
16

cases she cites.

17

of the cases she’s relying on in fact deal with this

18

problem of what happens if you can correct for malicious

19

prosecution but not false arrest.

20

There is dicta to that effect.

QUESTION:

Ncne

Well, let’s suppose that they’re

21

right, and that under New York law a false arrest claim

22

is part of malicious prosecution.

23

suggesting that we then have to redefine what is

24

malicious prosecution as a matter of Federal law, or

25

what ?

Do the -- are you

(202) 628-9300

1

HR. CLOSE:

Well, if she were correct that

2

it's not — that it's not -- then that leads to the

3

result that the court below was wronq in dismissing the

4

claims of arrest and imprisonment as time barred.
The cases she cites for that preposition don't

5

6

say that.

7

is, in almost every case, you have a false arrest and a

8

malicious prosecution together.

9

both.

The reason is — it's dicta, and the reason

You always sue for

In the cases where you have to distinguish

10
11

recovery from one theory than the other, we have cited

12

in our reply briefs, the courts have uniformly held what

13

you can recover for under New York law -- and we don't

14

concede New York law actually governs this — what you

15

can recover for under New York law for false arrest is

16

everything up to the arraignment.

17

arraignment onwards is malicious prosecution.

And from the

Therefore, if New York law is controlling, New

18
19

York law clearly is that she can only recover from the

20

arraignment forward.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CLOSE:

Is New York law controlling?
No, or the court below did not

23

hold that.

They relied on Federal law under Singleton.

24

And they -- they — the court below held that these

25

questions of accrual and so forth were governed by
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Federal law

2

They looked at Singleton, although Singleton

3

then incorporates a State law anyway.

4

below held that Singleton was controlling and dismissed

5

it.

6

And the court

We’ve always regarded the false arrest and

7

imprisonment claims as out of the case because the court

8

below dismissed them as time barred.

9

they’re not here

10

And we don’t --

because she didn’t cross petition.

With those claims out of the case, it’s much

11

simpler to analyze.

12

QUESTION:

The question is -Well, may I just interrupt?

Row

13

can you say they're out of the case when the Second

14

Circuit said they were in the case?

15
16
17

MR. CLOSE:

Well,

but the Second Circuit said

they were out of the case, also.
QUESTION:

Well, but only on the State law

18

cause of action.

19

understand it — they say the complaint alleges seven

20

hours of detention, great humiliation, ridicule and

21

mental anguish and so forth.

quite sufficient to constitute a Constitutional

23

deprivation of liberty action under 1983.

MR. CLOSE;

MR. CLOSE;

20

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
-- when the Second Circuit, as I

21

read their opinion on page A4, says this is part of

liberty was affected by what happened.

The only imaginable theory of recovery that is

even possibly in the case is Section 1933 -- 83.

under A22, they've dismissed, very plainly, Mrs.

Yes.
And these people were detained for

a certain period of time, weren't they?
MR. CLOSE:

But the detention is -- he just

16

held that to the extent that this is a 1983 claim based

17

on detention, and that's the argument in Singleton, that

18

is time barred as a matter of 1983 law.

19

exactly what the holding is at A22; that that part is --

20

and he relies back on Singleton, which had,

21

addressed this as a matter of 1983 law, what statute to

22

apply it and

And that is

again,

when to apply it.

23

I can't explain A4 except to say that they

24

forgot what they did at A22, and the point about the

seven hours of detention is dictum.

about is the great humiliation and ridicule and mental
anguish.
QUESTION;

Well, I mean, the Second Circuit

obviously ruled in favor of the respondents on some
point, because it’s you who are here and not they.

Yes, yes, Your Honor.
What was the basis upon which you

as such, I read them saying, is actionable

under Section 1983.
QUESTION;
MR. CLOSE;

Do you agree with that?
No, I don't agree with that.

But

I think that is the question that’s here.
QUESTION;
MR. CLOSE;

You think that was their reason?
And actually, there’s a fair

amount of circuit court authority which would support
the idea that if you have malicious prosecution under
common law, and you can satisfy "color of law" under
1983, that you therefore have a Section 1983 claim.
I read them as deciding that point in favor of
the respondent.

I think that they are wrong, but that’s

what they — that’s what they hold.

And they would

QUESTION!

Mr. Close, part and parcel of the

17

conduct that underlies the malicious prosecution claim

18

in this case is that a phony criminal charge was filed,

19

and that the individual charged was required to appear

20

and sit around the court for a long time waiting to

21

enter a plea, and was required to go back I don't knew

22

how many times -- eight, nine, whatever it was -- many

23

times, in addition to the reputational injury.

24
25

So the sum total of what underlies the
malicious prosecution here is a great many appearances

6

Do you think there's any deprivation of
liberty involved in that kind of a process?
MR. CLOSE;

Well,

assuming now we’re talking

7

about everything post-arraignment, the answer is no,

8

that is not the -- that's just another way of saying

9

that I was a defendant in a frivolous suit, and I had to

10

go to court eight or nine times, which is a 45 minute

11

drive from where she lives.

12

QUESTION;

Well, this Court has held for

13

example that being suspended from public school as a

14

student for ten days or so is a deprivation of liberty.

15

And yet you say that being hauled in to the

16

criminal court on a false charge and made tc wait and

17

appear and reappear is not; is that right?

18

MR. CLOSE;

Yes, that is not — our first --

19

the first two questions on which the petition is granted

20

is that the right to be free of frivolous suits is not,

21

as such, part of the liberty protected by the due

I don’t consider that

different than any civil case.
QUESTION;
MR. CLOSE;

(Inaudible.)
Well, Your Honor, I don’t think

that distinguishes this from the civil case that we cite
in our brief.

And New York

doesn’t even recognize a

cause of action for bringing a frivolous civil case.
And there are just as equal burdens in
defending a frivolous civil case as in defending a
frivolous criminal case, and in the civil case, you
don’t have any remedy at all.

You know, the exact same

allegations -- malicious, frivolous, baseless; you knew
you should never sue me, you sued me anyway, you asked
for millions cf dollars -- doesn’t state a claim for
relief at all.

MR. MILLERs

We're talking

8

New York tort law does not require, for recover, a

9

deprivation of life, liberty or property, as the Federal

Constitution does.

11
12

So you can't take every element of whatever
tort chooses to define to be an element of a 1983 action.
MR. MILLER:

13

No, you cannot, you're correct on

because this was a continuing conspiracy, Your Honor.
You can look at the conduct that was initiated when they

arrested, up until the moment that the charges were
finally dismissed.
QUESTION:

1983 does not give a cause of

action for a conspiracy.

Read the text of 1983.

It

does not give a cause of action for a conspiracy.

It

gives a cause of action for the deprivation of the life,
liberty or property.

1985 gives a cause of action for

conspiracy.
MR. MILLER;

However, this court has

recognized in, say, Adickes v. Kress, the notion of a
conspiratorial element as stating a cause of action.
QUESTION:

You can use the existence of a

conspiracy to attribute State action to private actors;

Now, that -- part of that time is attributable

Now, while that is not binding cn this Court
for the notion of speedy trial, it does suggest — give

12

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Miller, do you think that

13

where a person is not convicted, that speedy trial

14

analysis really adds much to the basic concept of

deprivation of liberty?

16

MR. MILLER;

I believe it does, Your Honor.

17

Because the person who is sitting there with charges

10

Your opponent relies heavily on the

for this detention.

14

MR. MILLER:

Yes,

Your Honor, they do rely on -

15

that.

16

Your Honors’

17

wrote that in any 1983 action, initial inquiry must

18

focus on whether the two essential elements of a 1983

19

cause of action are present, one, whether the conduct

20

complained of was committed by a person acting under

21

color of state law: clearly we have that here.

22

whether this conduct deprived a person of rights,

23

privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitutional

24

lavs of the United States.

25

But in the -- I would direct your attention to

plus we have the specific

Constitutional guarantees against the illegal search and
seizure, and against the right to a speedy trial.
QUESTION:

But Parratt went on to say, I think

-- and I think Hudson v. Palmer reiterated it — that in
some situations you had to look at the State remedy that
was provided for the petitioner's claim to decide
whether there had been any deprivation.
HR. MILLER;

Yes,

you did, Your Honor.

But

you were also, in those two cases, dealing with specific
property interests.

These were State-created rights;

not Federally-created rights.
And as Justice Stevens in his concurring
opinion in Daniels set forth the procedural due process
claim, it is not the deprivation of property that is
actionable; it is the fact that the property is deprived
without due process of law.
it becomes actionable under

Without adequate redress,
1983.

So that in the Hudson and Parratt, you were
dealing with property — State-created property
interests.

And the State did provide redress, albeit it

was post-deprivation rather than pre-deprivation.
QUESTION:

Do you claim that there is some

right, privilege or immunity at issue here other than
the due process deprivation?

I was saying is, if it's a

Oakes* treatment of

the case was that he felt that seven

2

hours of detention was sufficiently enough to remand the

case for trial that he need not go exploring for other

4

Constitutional rights.
But as long as there is one Constitutional

5
6

right, we submit that this case has to go to trial in

the District Court.
The petitioners have tried to make an argument

8

9

that there is a cutoff point at the moment of

10

arraignment under New York law between the false arrest

11

claim, which ceases from the moment of

arraignment.

From this they seek to infer that there is the

12

13

beginning of a malicious prosecution cause of action

14

that starts at the moment of arraignment.
That is squarely belied under New York law.

15
16

Sheldon v. Carpenter, for example -- and I quote from 4

17

New York 580

-- states that in an action for malicious

18

prosecution,

the plaintiff is entitled to recover

19

damages, not only for his unlawful arrest and

20

imprisonment and for the expense of his defense, but for

21

the injury to his name and character by reason of the

22

false accusation.

Isn’t it correct that the judgment

So that the case is just ready to

get started for trial?

6

8

Yes.

Yes.
So that's all that’s at stake, is

whether there's enough here to go to trial.
MR. CLOSE;

Yes, but the rationale of the

10

decision below, in response to my argument that Paul v.

11

Davis, Baker v. McCollan, and Gerstein v. Pugh, which

12

said malicious prosecution is not a claim under

13

the court below said, no, look, this is New York law.

14

It's valid under New York law.

15

1983,

His theory of Sixth Amendment would lead to a

16

very different kind of judgment, and so would his docket

17

notation theory.

18

So they're not arguments that would sustain

19

the ruling below, and therefore, I don't think that

20

they're properly presented.

21

And for the reasons we state In our brief, we

22

don't think substantive due process has anything tc do

2

And she is invoking the doctrine because she

3

wants an additional Federal remedy to what’s already

4

adequate under State law.
She's not like Mrs. Roe who comes here because

5

6

she has no remedy under State law at all.

7

Conway’s complaint can’t be considered under the
