blocks away from this courthouse no* on March 30th of

2

1981, he was a victim of an assassination attempt.
That will be six years from next Monday, and

3
4

this case goes on ani on.
At the constables’

5

office, business was going

6

on as usual.

Pis new deputy, Ardith McPherson, had been

7

assigned primarily In her initial period as a computer

8

opera tor.
Let me explain one thing about our constables

9

10

office.

Our downtown constable is Salter Eankin.

The

11

other seven constables are scattered all over the county

12

by population

groupings there.

13

But they are not around the downtown

14

courthouse complex, which has about five court buildings

15

there that generate all of the court process, the

16

majority of the court process that goes out to the other

17

precincts for service.
The new system which we call JIMS -- Justice

18
19

Information Management System -- all of the process

20

throughout the county comes into Constable Rankin's

21

office,

22

16 justice of the peace courts scattered over the

23

county, 8 constables offices scattered over the county,

24

the district clerk's office and the county clerk's

25

office both across the street from him, as well as

and it is put onto computers which plays back in

(202) 628-9300

1

juvenile infarmation goes on these same computers there.
So that any officer, court or law enforcement

2
3

who is wanting to know at any particular moment the

4

status of service of process in any of these cases can

5

punch it up on the computer and have the answer right

6

there before him as to what attempts have been made on

7

service, what service has been completed, what service

8

has been rejected because of

bad addresses .

Anyway, the information is readily available

9

10

throughout the county, based

upon the input by Constable

11

Rankin’s office in the first instance before he sends

12

the process out to other officers.
Now, when Constable Rankin appointed Ardith

13
14

McPherson his deputy, he did

this under a statute in

15

Texas that says that all of the constable's employees

16

are deputies.
He is not authorized to employ clerks, people

17
18

to answer the telephone, people to do the typing.

19

Everybody that he enploys is a deputy constable.

Does that also include the man that

sweeps the floor in the constable’s office?

No, sir,

it does not.

QUESTION:

4

MR.

LEE:

LEE;

Well, how far down does it go?
All right.
How far

down?

Tie man who sweeps the floor in the

5

constable’s office is not employed by the constable.

6

He’s employed by commissioners’ court who takes care of

7

all of the courthouses.

Eut everybody who the constable appoints --

QUESTION:

2

I mean, you're talking about the

3

whole county is interested in what she does and all?

4

You don't really mean that, do you?
All she does is what --

5
6

How many people

punch computers in Harris County, would you estimate?
MR. LEE;

7

All right.

It's going to have to be

8

a far out estimate, Your Honor.

9

that we probably have three to five hundred people who

10

do it.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. LEE;

13

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be closer to thousands?
It may very well be, Your Honor.
I think

we have a misunderstanding

14

about the importance of the job.

15

to hear about .

16
17

I would make a guess

And that's what I want

What does she do that's so important to the
county, to the state and to the United States?

18

MR.

LEE;

All right.

Under our Texas law, the

19

constable employed her.

20

spite of the fact that all she does is punch in

21

information on her computer.

She is a deputy constable, in

22

If she did not do that part of the constable's

23

duties, he himself would have to take his time and punch

24

in that information there because that assignment was

25

made for him to handle these computer inputs in the
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

first instance there.
So one of his deputies, Ms. McPherson, was

2
3

doing the constable's duties to the extent that she was

4

just punching in informationi.

5

QUESTION:

I guess

it's a lucky thing then

6

that the constable is not himself responsible for

7

keeping the courthouse clean,

8

case.

I mean, you -MR.

9
10

sir.

LEE:

That is right,
QUESTION;

11
12

which could have been the

Which could have been the case, yes,
because he would then -Then your argument would indeed

extend to the man who swept the floor? right?
MR.

13

LEE;

He would

have employed a deputy who

14

swept the floor, unless there were some changes in the

15

law that authorized him to emoloy the floor sweepers.
QUESTION;

16
17

would be making the same

argument here —

18

MR.

19

QUESTION;

20

And you

LEE;

Yes, sir.
-- because that man had the name of

deputy ?

21

MR.

LEE;

22

All right.

That's right.
Now, we have a constitutional oath

23

in Texas that every officer elected must take, and every

24

officer appointed must take,

25

this oath that says that she will uphold the office of

and Deputy McPherson took

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

deputy constable, and that she will uphold and support

2

the Constitution and laws of the United States and of

3

the State of Texas.

4

Now, only the constable was elected.

5

metropolitan area that is Harris County, which has about

6

20 percent of the entire population of the state of

7

Texas in our county lines, the constable himself cannot

8

possibly do all of the duties that the legislature has

9

placed upon him by statute to do.

10

In the

For one thing, at the time of this case we had

11

about 160,000 pieces of process come through his office

12

for channeling out to the other constables.

13
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, is this process, is it

civil; is it criminal; is it both?

15

MR. LEE;

It is both, Your Honor.

16

It is generally civil process, because his

17

office is the incoming mailbox for all of the other 253

18

counties in Texas,

19

of the state, that send process into Harris County.

and for counties and courts outside

20

It is the originator, the square one there

21

that makes all of the rest of the -- and he has more

22

computer agents, I would say, in his one office than all

23

of the other seven constables put together there.

24
25

But that does not mean that he does all of the
work there.

He gust is the initial inputter.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But

1

because of the greater litigation area in his precinct

2

there, he probably handles about 25 percent of all of

3

the service process, and the other seven handle 75

4

percent of it.
All

5

right.

Now, this court and other courts

6

throughout the state and the nation have consistently

7

taken the viewpoint that the constable is an officer of

8

the court.

He is a law enforcement officer.
In Texas we have a Code of Criminal Procedure

9
10

that says that he is a conservator of the peace, that he

11

is charged with suppressing crime.
Now in this particular instance when the radio

12
13

in the computer room announced that an attempt was made

14

to assassinate President Reagan, it apparently has

15

failed, and he is being pushed into a car and leaving

16

the scene.

17

And

—

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Lee, was this lady fired

19

because of what sie said or because of what she

20

believed?

21

Do we know that?
I mean, suppose when she was called in by the

22

constable and asked whether she had said that, she said,

23

"Yes, I said it."

24
25

MR.

LEE:

She was, Your Honor.

She was called

in by the constable.

4

MR.

LEE*.

5

QUESTIDN;

Yes, sir.
Do we know whether she would have

6

been fired?

I mean, conceivably you might fire her

7

anyway.

8

you shouldn’t talk like that, whether you mean it or

9

not.

I mean, he might have said,

"Well, you know,

T don’t want that kind of talk in my law

10

enforcement agency, wiether you mean it or not.

11

shows poor judgment, and you're fired."

12

Was that the basis for his dismissal?

13

MR.

LEE:

Your Honor, I would say not, based

14

upon two trials that we have been through in the

15

District Cour t .

16

In the District Court, Captain LeVrier heard

No.

He asked her that.

21

again, she hoped ne«t time they got him.

And he went

22

over to her, and he said, "You don’t really mean that.”

23

She said, "Yes, I do mean it."

24

So then through channels that information was

25

carried to Constable Rankin who called her into his

Hay it please the Court, this Court has noted

2

on more than one occasion that the State's interests as

3

an employer in regulating the expressive activities of

4

its employees differs guite significantly from those it

5

possesses in connection with

6

the citizenry

7

regulation of the speech of

in general.

The Court has upheld various restrictions on

8

the expressive activities of public employees,

9

restrictions that could not have been applied to the

10

11

citizenry in general.
For example, in Snepp versus United States,

12

this Court upheld the right of the CIA to screen its

13

employees' publications, a system of prior restraint

14

which simply could not have been applied to the

15

citizenry in general.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Nager, that's what we have

17

here, a firing because of what she said, not because of

18

the kind of person she was; right?

19

It wasn't that "I don't want somebody here who

20

hopes that the President will get assassinated the next

21

time successfully,” but rather, "I don't want somebody

22

who says that kini of thing."

MR.

HAGER;

-- by what the constable said.

2

In fact, as we read the record, he terminated

3

her for expressing her approval of the violation of a

4

serious criminal law;, that is, he did fire her for what

5

she said.
I’m not guite sure there’s another way she

6
7

could have said the same thing, that he could have just

8

fired her for the manner of her expression.
But we do think he did fire her for the

9
10

substance of what she said; that is, that if they go for

11

him again, I hope t.iey get him.
QUESTION;

12

Is there reason to think she would

13

have been fired if she had said that, but then it turned

14

out that she didn’t mean it?
MR.

15

HAGER;

The record doesn’t reflect what

16

Constable Rankin's thinking was on that subject, Justice

17

Rehnguist.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

It was important to him.

He asked

her that, didn’t he?
MR.

NAGER;

Yes, he did, which shows that he

21

was trying to find out whether or not she was an

22

individual who indeed believed that it was okay to

23

assassinate -- attempt to assassinate the President, to

24

violate criminal laws.

25

Now, we tnink that this Court’s decision

an employer differ from those it has when it acts in its

capacity as a sovereign.

The first is that the Government's interest as

And, in addition, employment-related

5

6

sanctions, while placing a burden on First Amendment

7

rights to be sure, are a much lesser burden than general

8

criminal or civil sanctions.
Thus, the court has upheld the right of the

9

10

Government to place reasonable restrictions on the

11

expressive activities of public employees, in order to

12

promote substantial governmental interests.
And we think that this is precisely such a

case.

desire for an assassination of the President.

Respondent in this case was an employee of a law

The law enforcement agency for which she

worked is by definition committed to the enforcement of

criminal laws.

MR.

1

NA3ER;

We believe the answer would be the

2

same, Justice O’Connor, although the twist on the theory

3

would be slightly different.
Here, the constable’s office is a law

4
5

enforcement agency; and the expressive activity is

6

directly inconsistent with the principal function of

7

that office.

The clerk’s office would not be, quote, a law

9

That is, it is a law enforcement agency.

enforcement agency.

But it does have an interest in

10

having employees who won’t engage in expressive activity

11

inconsistent with its function.

12

And when an employee --

No, Justice Marshall, not for

requirements of the law.
A law enforcement agency doesn't just engage

CHIEF JUSTICE REHHQUIST;

We’ll hear now from you, Mr. Cutler.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LLOYD CUTLER,

17
18

ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

15
16

Thank you, Mr. Nager.

MR.

CUTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
It’s common grounds in this case that Mrs.

19

McPherson’s remarks were not

20

which can constitutionally be branded as illegal.

21

were not libelous or obscene or fighting words or a

22

threat of or an incitement to assassination or the

23

violent overthrow of the government.

24
25

among the classes of speech

There are really two disputed issues.

They

The

first is whether these remarks were on a serious matter
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of public concern and, therefore, on the highest rung of

2

the ladder of First Amendment values.

3

The second is whether the balancing test of

4

the Pickering/Connick line of cases, which both sides

5

accept for weighing the speech of public employees.
Mrs. McPherson's right to speak is outweighed

6
7

by the governmental interests in the efficiency of the

8

public service.
Under the Connick test we accept that for the

9
10

Fifth Circuit's views to be upheld in this Court, we

11

must prevail on both of those issues.

12

I'd like to turn first --

13

QUESTION

For instance, if a newspaperman

i

14

heard about this statement and interviewed her on

15

television and said, "Do you really think that you would

faced the public -- an FBI officer, a cop on the beat --

perhaps it's a different case.

said.

12

Justice White.

13

Well, he says, "What's your job?"

CUTLER;

Well, that was not what she

I don’t think that’s close to what she said,

Perhaps that gets to the question of whether

14

she was addressing an issue of public concern.

15

take it, although tie Solicitor General at one point

16

seems to dispute this, there is no doubt that the

17

context in form aid content of her remarks are something

18

that this Court will judge for itself, because this is a

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think it's perfectly clear that if she had

1
2

been in a discussi, on of the President’s policies, the

3

Administration's policies, the day before, she never

4

would have uttered that comment.
If it had been weeks later, it’s most unlikely

5
6

that she would have uttered that comment.
It was a comment that was simply evoked by the

7
8

circumstances, the shock of the report which everybody

9

feels.

10
11

And once she heard that, she used

that figure of

speech in expressing her disapproval.
When you make an examination of what she

12

actually said, as — and this is undisputed testimony --

13

she begins by saying, after this first news, "It must

14

have been a black who did it," to her colleague at the

15

next desk to whom sis has since been married.

16

She then says -- she makes comments about the

17

President’s policies on food stamps, on CETA , on public

18

welfare programs; and her colleague at the next desk

19

agrees with her.

20

And than she says -- and that happens to be at

21

the very moment when Captain LeVrier is walking up --

22

"The next time tiay try it, I hope they get him."

23

In its context, there isn't the slightest

24

question that that remark is a remark in the course of a

25

discussion of the political -- of Administration

It was the constable's loss of confidence in

her that was his basis for firing her, and as I'll try

6

to get to in a moment in response to your earlier

7

question to Mr. Lee, it was based more on her beliefs

8

than anything else.

9

In Connick's words it was "speech as a

The fact that it

occurred in the workplace was certainly not a matter of

deliberate choice on her part.
