ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. STRAIN

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT CTS CORPORATION

7

MR. STRAIN:

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courti

9

The principle this Court must consider in this

10

case is the federalist intention between the power of

11

Indiana to define the bundle of rights inherent in

12

Indiana created corporations and the implicit limitation

13

on that cower derived from the commerce clause when

14

Congress has not acted.

15

There was a different holding as well in the

16

Seventh Circuit's opinion, and that was a pre-emption

17

holding.

18

argument, I might say, is that it is possible that in

19

light of the controlled share acquisition statute under

20

consideration today, a hostile bidder might wish to keep

21

his tender offer open for 50 days instead of the 23-day

22

or 20 business day minimum currently required by Rule

23

14(e)1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

24

Unlike the position the United

25

3ut tie centerpiece of that holding and DCA's

States took in

this Court in MITE, in this case the United States has
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

argued that the statute is not pre-empted.

2

SEC has taken no exception to that position .

3

Morever, the

The SEC, indeed, is a signator on the brief in

4

the same sense as being a part of the brief.

5

might say to the Court as wall, it has been suggested to

6

me that the SEC did not join in that portion of the

7

United States’ argument but similarly there are portions

8

of the commerce clause that only refer to the United

9

States .

10

It strikes me,

therefore,

And I

that the SEC

11

disagreed.

12

fundamental issue, then, before this Court is whether

13

the dormant commerce clause limits the ability of

14

Indiana to enact a statute that concededly does not

15

discriminate between in-state and out-of-state

16

acquirers; that unlike the statute this Court considered

17

in MITE, does not pose any possibility of multiple and

18

inconsistent burdens that nresents no different kind of

19

alleged burdens on interstate commerce than any number

20

of other corporate statutes regulating the relationships

21

inter sese among shareholders of Indiana created

22

corporations.

It should have said so, and it has not.

Mr. Strain, may I inquire what you

think the purpose of the statute is?

MR. STRAIN:

Based on the theory that we

QUESTION;

makes no difference.

Well, is it a purpose then to

14

provide protection to stockholders of public

15

corporations incorporated in Indiana?

16
17

MR. STRAIN;

Ultimately, that has to be the

purpose.

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. STRAIN;

20

QUESTION;

You think that is the purpose?
Yes,

ma’am.

Is it kind of a strange form of

21

stockholder protection to in fact strip the stockholders

22

of their right to transfer voting shares?

23

kind of a peculiar protection?

24
25

MR. STRAIN;

Isn't that

Stripping the shareholders of the

vote, of course, is one way to put what goes on.

That is that the shareholders -- that is a

5

sufficiently important interest, at least as defined by

aware, that the shareholders have the right to vote on

14

It is precisely what happens in this case.

15

QUESTION;

Well, do you think the state could

16

pass an outright prohibition of the transfer of voting

17

shares in takeover bids?

18

MR. STRAIN!

This Court sguarely held in

19

Aldridge that among the bundle of rights that the state

20

creates is the right of transferability.

21

therefore could pass a statute that ultimately says,

22

there shall be no transfer at all of any rights in

23

connection with the shares.

25

so, and indeed I believe it

foolish to io so
QUESTION;

You think, there would be no

commerce clause violation or concern, in any event?
MR. STRAIN;

Indeed I do not.

In fact, the

5

government so argues in its argument when it tells us

6

that it is possible to structure a corporate statute

7

that says, there shall be no transfers when there is a

8

possibility for someone to own more than 20 percent of

9

the outstanding shares of the corporation.

10
11

QUESTION;

May I follow up on the question --

I am over here.

12

MR. STRAIN;

13

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, Justice Scalia.
Justice O'Connor asked about one of

14

the purposes served perhaps by this statute, and other

15

similar statutes, is to retain major corporate

16

headquarters in a state.

17

have the headquarters of a major corporation located in

18

It's not the State

10

of Indiana that gets to decide, which again is unlike

11

the situation in MITE.

Remember that ultimately what occurs is that

Characterizing the triggering

The easiest way to demonstrate that for the

Court's purposes is to take a look at the partnership

laws.

15

every partnership law has to fall on the same basis

16

because those are transactions where the economic

17

benefits are transferred and the voting rights are, to

use the teem so often used by the other side and by the

Court, stripped by virtue of the transaction.

To bring it home,

10

QUESTION;

11

NR. PRITSHftRD:

I would be interested to hear.
Judge Posner concluded in his

12

opinion that the statute, in his words, set up a

13

gauntlet that few tender offers could run.

14

strong and colorful language, but on what basis did he

15

reach these conclusions?

This is

16

He gives us only two reasons.

17

his view no rational bidder seeking control of an

18

Indiana corporation would purchase the shares without

19

knowing the outcome of the shareholder vote, and since

20

the shareholder vote could not transpire except after 50

21

days, that the statute as a practical matter imposes a

22

50-day delay

23

considered that this would be burdensome.

24
25

First, since in

on the consummation of tender offers and he

Second, he stated

that by virtue of the fact

that the statute requires a shareholder vote, the
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

success of the offer is, as he put it, subject to the

2

tender mercies of the.existing shareholders of the

3

company.

4

On the first point, we submit that Judge

5

Posner was simply wrong because he failed to consider

6

the practical alternatives that are open to a bidder in

7

a tender offer to which the statute applies.

8

demonstrate in our brief that nothing in the statute

9

delays the commencement of a tender offer.

10

We

There is no pre-notification requirement like

11

the one that this Court dealt with in MITE.

12

the statute prevents shareholders from tendering their

13

shares immediately to the bidder, to the bidder's escrow

14

agent, as soon as the offer has been made.

15

Nothing in

prevents the

18

purchase immediately after the minimum 2P-day waiting

19

period that is occvided for in the EEC's rules.

20

bidder from accepting the shares that have

We may concede Judge Posner's point that many

21

bidders seeking control would want the voting rights

22

issuie resolved before they paid for the stock.

23

this desire is easily accommodated as the bidder could

24

request the shareholder election on the same day he

25

presents the offer, and structure the offer so that the
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But

1

acceptance of the tendered shares for payment was

2

conditioned upon tie later outcome of a favorable vote

3

on the voting rights issue.

4

This would have the effect of lockina up the

5

stock so far as the bidder was concerned, and it would

6

also cut off shareholders’ right to withdraw their

7

shares after the acceptance.

8
9

Your Honors, this procedure is not new.

It is

followed every day in many tender offers which are

10

subject to conditions such as the receipt of required

11

regulatory approvals such as those imposed by the

12

Federal Communications Commission, by the Federal

13

Reserve Board, by the Insurance Commissioners of various

14

states who are required to approve a transfer of control

15

before it takes place.

16

It is also followed when offers are

17

conditioned on the dismantling of certain defenses that

18

the targets of these tender offers have erected, such as

19

poison pills, so that to condition the acceptance for

20

payment on the receipt of voting rights is no different

21

from the practice that prevails in other contexts

22

routinely in the tender offer area.

23

In fact, so common is this practice that the

24

SEC has provided explicit guidance on the subject in its

25

interpretive releases which

we quote in our brief.
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And

it is instructive, we believe, that despite the
opportunity to do so in its

brief, the SEC did not take

the position that the 50-day period for the election
would result in any actual delay.
Even if the statute did delay the consummation
of the purchase for 50 days, that period is limited.
is not an unlimited
MITE.

It

period as the Court dealt with in

And I know it is only 22 days longer than the

minimum period of 23 days that is prescribed by the
SEC's own rules.
So, much more is required, we submit, than
unsupported speculation to find that this sc burdens
tender offers as to render the Indiana statute
unconstitutional.

This is especially true.

Your Honors,

when there has been no showing that there are defenses
which the target could put into place in

5h days that

the target couldn't also put into place in 23 days.
Furthermore, we believe that no showing could
be made that hostile tender offers can normallly be
concluded in

28 days, given

the litigation that swirls

around these corporate wars.
Turning to the second point, Judge Posner felt
that the shareholder vote, the fact that a shareholder
vote had to take place, was a burden on interstate
commerce.

However, it seems self-evident that if the

The statute also has a strange quirk because
it doesn’t disqualify the shares of directors who are

not officers of the corporation, but we know because of

structural bias who it is who puts those directors in.

It's management, and those folks are going to vote for

numerous things that takes this level playing field and

That is one of the

I think that's a good introduction to the

5

place I think this case ought to start and that is with

Judge Posner's comments in his opinion, his lingering

doubts about whether or not

pre-empts state takeover statutes such as this.

occasions, the question is whether or not the state

accomplishing the purposes and the objectives of the

14

Now, if we remove these lingering doubts, and

15

if four Honors in this case do that, then it becomes

16

unnecessary to get into the great silences of the

17

commerce clause and it becomes unnecessary to go into

the Williams Act's principal purpose is to protect the

What I am saying is that that's

14

statute fails both under the Williams Act and under the

15

commerce clause because it is an obstacle to the

16

accomplishment of the purpose of the Williams Act and

17

because it does unduly burden interstate commerce.

18

I was trying to make the point with a

19

hypothetical

20

is, if Indiana had said you have to have 90 percent, a

21

90 percent vote, there's a point out there at which

22

these fundamental corporate matters that Your Honor is

addressing now would become impediments,

of, it's a negative enrollment scheme in Indiana.

All

10

problems of that statute because that is the one that

permits the discrimination in favor of Indiana

13

It's a little bit like the Court's decision in

reasons the statute was struck down was because the

are right, Justice White, and that is that the

Because if the management of an

are opposing a prospective takeover by a Connecticut

New York corporation, and what they do

10

then is they arrange to have a friendly takeover with an

11

Indiana corporation and then they can simply opt out of

Different point.

Another point that I wanted to make is that
Mr. Strain in the beginning of his presentation

10

indicated that perhaps there was a misstatement in CTS's

11

reply brief, and it is an important one because the

12

government has filed a brief in this case, two branches

13

of the government, the government -- that is, the

14

Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange

15

Commission.

16

Both the Justice Department and the Securities

17

and Exchange Commission support DCA, our position, and

18

that is that the commerce clause renders the Indiana

19

statute invalid because of the excessive burdens.

20

in the reply brief CTS says in effect that the SEC also

21

throws in the towel on the Williams Act;

22

the SEC says that the Williams Act does not pre-empt the

23

field.

24
25

But­

that is, that

It is an important ooint, that that is not the

drafted in such a vay that it is only the Justice ■

2

Department and not the SEC that says the Williams Act

3

doesn't pre-empt the statute, because of course the SEC

argued in KITE, the SEC argued in Kidwell , the SEC

5

argued in Household in the Delaware Supreme Court that

6

the Williams

7

statutes because it was an obstacle tc tender offers,

8

got in -- as they say, got in the way.

9

*ct did in fact pre-empt those state

The other point that I wanted to make, which

10

is also raised in the reply brief that was filed by CTS

11

and we didn't haye, obviously, a chance to respond in

12

writing, is this notion that this is only a private

13

matter, private individuals, and the state really isn't

14

involved in the obstacles to the Williams Act or the

15

burden on interstate commerce.

16

That point is sort of stunning because Indiana

17

has enacted a blueprint, a very detailed blueprint here,

18

under which the corporations chartered by the State of

19

Indiana can invoke these burdens and obstacles and it’s

20

subject to the same kind of analysis that this Court has

21

done on many occasions under the Fourteenth Amendment

22

because finding state action means finding a state that

23

provides an impetus or a blueprint for private

24

individuals to violate rights.
Obviously, only states can violate the

state which changes the law prospectively, there is no
commerce in the shires of the new state, the 51st state,
and there is

no commerce, I

think in the shares of the

new corporation in "X" state as to which there is no
transferability or no vote.
So that, any corporation that is foolish
enough to incorporate in a state that had that kind of
restriction, you'd be unable to raise capital.

The

capital markets would walk away from a corporation like
that in a flash.
If you take that state chartered corporation
with those kinds of restrictions and do it willingly,
then you subject yourself to those restrictions.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Sachnoff, your argument

strikes me as a little bit at odds with this Court's
case in Exxon against Maryland where the state law was
enacted and it clearly favored in-state retailers at the
expense of out-of-state suppliers.

Ninety-five percent

of the suppliers were from out of state and

the Court

said that didn't make any difference.
MR. SMHSQFF:

Your Honor,

in Exxon — I view

Exxon as analogous to the blue sky laws because it had
to do with products coming into Maryland and it had to
do with the fact that the state regulation there didn't
