ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR., ES3 •,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARKIN:

10

Thank, you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to

11
12

the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth

13

Circuit.

14

The issues in this case stem from the March 3,

15

1981 search of respondent's farmhouse.

16

carried out under the authority granted not by a search

17

warrant but by a consent-to-search clause in the

18

judgment of probation and due to the respondent's

19

sentencing proceeding.

20

That proceeding followed respondent’s

21

convictions on two firearms charges.

22

as we now know, was stayed.

23

That search was

incised, even respondent's own attorney, all held a

reasonable and good faith belief that they were

authorized to conduct a search by virtue of the February

4

27 order entered by the municipal court.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

5

6

reversed.

At the outset, the court concluded that

7

respondent was not, in fact, on probation at the time of

8

the search, because the original sentence had been

stayed in its entirety, and

not just to period of

confinement.

10

The court then want on to address the order

12

entered at the February 27 hearing.

13

held that the order entered at that proceeding, and its

14

terms, was a nullity because respondent was not

15

personally notified about the hearing.
The Court of Appeals, after entering that

16

ruling, went on to address the government’s argument

The Court of Appeals granted our petition,

which presented both the notice and the good faith

questions.

below on an additional grounds, namely —
QUESTION;

6

Respondent has sought to defend the judgment

You mean, this Court granted your

petition, not the Court of Appeals?
NR. LARKIN;

7

Oh, if I misspoke, I'm sorry.

8

This Court granted the petition limited to those two

9

questions.
And respondent has sought to defend the

10
11

judgment below on the additional ground that the

12

February 27 hearing was invalid because he wasn't

13

present.

14
15
16

Now, there are several different ways this
Court could resolve the issues in this case.
Technically speaking, if this Court were to

17

disagree with the Ninth Circuit insofar as the Ninth

18

Circuit held personal notice of a hearing is required,

19

this Court could reverse the judgment below on that

20

ground alone.

21

However, the Court could also, we believe,

22

decide the case solely on the good faith grounds that

23

the Court of Appeals rested its decision in part on.

MR. LARKIN;

That deals with the substantive

law of probation searches.

MR. LARKIN;

10

Okay.

And that's a question that the

Court will address in the Griffin rase.
Insofar as this case goes, given that

assumption, if this Court were to find that it was

pretextual search.

20
21

QUESTION;

Mr.

Larkin, what do you mean when

you use the word ''pretextual"?
MR. LARKIN;

Well, the Court of Appeals seemed

22

to be believing that the purpose of this search was not

23

to enforce his probation, but was to conduct a criminal

24

investigation of something else.

25

QUESTION;

Are those totally distinct?
8

MR. LARKIN;

1

In our view, they shouldn't be.

2

The reason is, here, for example, if respondent -- if

3

there was reasonable cause to believe that he had

4

violated some of the law, then it perhaps would be

5

possible to conduct a probation search on that ground.
The Court of Appeals seemed to be adding into

that are just wrong under California law that's clearly

the prosecutor had an objectively

reasonable and a subjectively reasonable good faith

16

The Court of Appeals seemed to say that

17

because therewere certain elements not present in this

18

type of search that it believed should be present, it

19

couldn't have been a probation search.

20

The Court of Appeals pointed to the fact that

21

he hadn't been assigned a probation officer, but that's

22

irrelevant under California

23

law.

A police officer doesn't need the
authorization of a probation officer to carry out a
search of this type, and a probation officer doesn't

In addition, the facts under California law

HR. LARKIN:
QUESTIONS

Correct.

But that --

And two minutes later they went to

search him?
MR. LARKIN:

That’s correct.

It's our

position that the California Superior Court appellate
division got it right when it said that he couldn’t have
his probation revoked for failing to comply with the
terms of his probation; but that didn’t mean that a
probation officer, in this case a police officer, could
not cross the threshold of his home once the February 27
order was entered.
QUESTIONS

(Inaudible.)

MR. LARKIN:

That’s right.

California law, either a probation officer or a police
officer can conduct a search .

now the good faith argument that we’ve made in our

I will not address the notice argument that

MB. LARKIN;

I believe technically speaking

that would end the matter at this time.
However, the Court of Appeals in our view has

11

clearly signalled, for the reasons I explained to

12

Justice Scalia, how it views this case.

13

and

And I thin* there’s no doubt that

if the case

14

goes back on remand, the Court of Appeals will rely on

15

some of the reasons given in the second part of' its

16

opinion to find that the search here was unlawful

noneth eless.

18
19

20

But I will not address the notice point any
futher, and will speak now only to the good faith point.
QUESTION:

Well, on the notice point, do you

21

ask us to disagree with the Court of Appeals that under

22

California law, the judge stayed the entire sentence

23

rather than -- stayed the entire judgment, rather than

24

just a sentence?

25

MR. LARKIN:

We do not ask the Court to

ruling.

He have not petitioned on that

We have not challenged the Court of

Appeals*

4

Our only argument on the notice issue is that,

5

for the reasons we've explained, notice to a defendant's

6

attorney in a criminal case of any proceeding that

7

occurs during that case is sufficient to satisfy any due

8

process notice requirement.
QUESTION;

9

So that even if -- even if this was

10

an original sentencing hearing, notice to the attorneys

11

is enough?
MR. LAPKIN;

12
13

It would be enough for the

purpose of notice.

QUESTION;

The defendant may have a valid claim if he

But for the purpose of notice, that would be
sufficient in our view.
QUESTION:

Sr. Larkin, before you leave the

21

notice aspect of the case, let's assume that you're dead

22

right, that the order is not a nullity.

23

perhaps, one could ask, what is the effective date of

24

the order, insofar as it imposes conditions of probation

25

on the defendant?

But rather,

13

Mr. Larkin, I'm getting confused by

this discussion.
Now, I thought the defendant was personally

14
15

present at his original sentencing hearing, when the

16

terms and conditions of probation were presented to him;

17

and he looked it over and accepted it and consented to

18

the probation terms.

19

Is that correct or not?

Following that, the court entered a stay of his

2

sentence, and it was the position taken by the Court of

3

Appeals later that that stay apparently was effective

4

for both probation and the jail term.
The state moved for a clarification of that,

5

and the defendant was not personally present at the

MR. LARKIN;

This Court would not need

to go

further than that.

signalled how they view this case.

Now , it '3 our view that the officers, as I

1

2

said, had an objectively reasonable belief that the

3

consent to search clause imposed in respondent's

this case.
These types of conditions are not unigue to

They're well established in

For nearly a decade prior to the search in

be valid both as legitimate conditions of probation and

as lawful under the Fourth Amendment .

13

California Supreme Court expressly addressed

14

the validity under the Fourth Amendment of these types

of conditions in the Mason case in 1971, and between the

In this case there

The decision on which the Court of Appeals

19

relied to rule that respondent was not on probation from

21

case; and therefore, no member of the search team can

reasonably be deemed to have been aware of it.

23

Respondent and amici also argue that there are

already exceptions to the warrant requirement that

If as we believe Leon rested on a deterrent

whether or not the February 27th order was effective,

3

and I direct this specifically to Justice O'Connor,

4

because regardless — regardless of what this Court

5

decides about the effectiveness of the order that was

6

arrived at on February 27, this search was not justified

7

as a probation search.

8

Under the law of the State of California,

9

there must be reasonable belief that a person is in

10

violation of a ooniition of probation, and the alleged

11

violations that were brought to the court in this case

12

all occurred prior to February 27th, prior to the date

13

of that order.
There was never any allegation that there was

Even if there's consent, that's

only -- that consent does not waive reasonable cause?
MS. COOPER:

That's correct.

For all of the

reasons in the cases cited in our brief.

S3. CD3P33:

There must be a reasonable

suspicion of a probation violation.

It must be

reasonably related to probation supervision.

And the

scope must be appropriate.

the good faith issue — when Ms. Bazar was in court, she

file.

She knew that the judge had issued an order
reinstating him.

She never told the judge what she

intended to do, not to make sure he was abiding by
probation, but to do a search.
She basically, in our view, committed a fraud
upon the court because what she really wanted was a
warrantless search of his house, and she didn't tell the
judge.
All of the complaints, by the time that March
3rd rolls around,

all of the complaints are post -- are

pre-February 27.

There are no current complaints.

As a

matter of fact, the complaints were in. January and very
early February.

They're at least a month old.

defendant does not think that he is on probation.

LARKIN, ESQ,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LARKIN;

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

The first thing I’d like to say is, there

7

plainly was reasonable cause to believe that a probation

8

search was related to probation.
There’d been gunfire reported on the

respondent’s neighborhood.

In the Britton case we cited

Yes, but that was before he was on

The gunfire was back in January, wasn’t it?
MR. LARKIN;

The gunfire was at a time when

the prosecutor could have reasonably believed that he

was on probation.

February 27th?

MR. LARKIN;

That’s right.

But that’s just a

recasting of their stale evidence argument.
QUESTION;

Well, but means that it’s essential

23

for you to establish not merely that the prosecutor when

24

she went in thought that the February 27th order was

25

valid without notice, but also that she thought when she

MR. LARKIR:

Well, she had
