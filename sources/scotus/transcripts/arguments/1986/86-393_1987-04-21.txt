"Further ordered that the clerk enter final judgment In

23

HR. WRIGHT;

The clerk is required to enter a

final judgment on the docket sheet* and we printed that

We realize that under the result that we contend is

Concerning the final Judgment entered in favor

16

of the FTCA claim I would like to note only that the

17

whole point of Rute 54B is to resolve a case as to

certain issues or as to certain parties» and that this

19

case was resolved in favor of the United States when

20

respondent decided not to appeal that final judgment.

21

In addition I would tike to note that the Eleventh

22

Circuit's jurisdiction In this case was based on its

23

acceptance for interlocutory appeal of the question

Are there decisions In the Courts

There are such decisions.

have cited a number of them.

It is sometimes difficult

9

to draw precisely the line as to where the certified

Finally on that point I would just like to

16
17

note that the Eleventh Circuit did not even appear to be

18

aware that there was a Jurisdictional problem* although

19

we did raise that in our rehearing petition that they

20

denied.

21

that that claim Is barred by Feres because respondent

22

was administered LSD Incident to his military service.

23

In its 1981 decision In this case* the Fifth Circuit

24

noted that in 1958 respondent was a master sergeant in

25

the Army who had volunteered to participate in an

was conducted on an Army base by and for the benefit of

he was promised a letter of commendation for his

disagreed with the conclusion that respondent was

I might add as welt that in the second

No court

10

participating in this program incident to his military

11

service» not even the Eleventh Circuit.

12

that an FTCA claim Is not necessarily barred because the

13

injury on which the claim is based occurred incident to

14

mi Iitary service.

15

It instead held

We argued in Johnson» the FTCA case involving

16

a helicopter crash that was argued in this Court in

17

February» that this Court held in Feres shortly after

18

the FTCA was enacted that Congress did not intend to

19

waive sovereign immuntty for torts occurring incident to

20

military service» and that there Is no reason to revisit

21

that construction of the statute which Congress has not

22

seen fit to alter in 37 years.

23

I will not repeat that argument today but do

24

want to note that this case represents a significant

25

extension of the Eleventh Circuit's erroneous decision

15

sent to the District Court after this Court issued its

16

decision In Chappell v. Wallace explained that this

17

Court "held that the same principles which underlie the

18

Feres doctrine and which require absolute immunity from

19

an FTCA action also require immunity from a Bivens

20

constitutional action against Federal officers."

21

is an accurate description of this Court's holding.

Except for the courts below* ail of the other courts of

23

Appeals that have considered the question have

24

understood that this Court barred servicemen from

25

bringing Bivens suits against their superiors and did

The letter that counsel for respondent

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

That

1

not authorize any case by case inquiry of the sort

2

■andated by the court below.

3

That is absolutely clear from this Court's

4

opinion in Chappell which reversed the Ninth Circuit
/

5

opinion that did not authorize the plaintiff to bring

6

their Bivens action but instead renanded the case for

7

application of certain tests simitar to those set out in

8

the Fifth Circuit's Hlndes v. Seaman case to determine

9

whether the plaintiffs there could proceed.

This Court

10

rejected that balancing approach* holding instead that

11

enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to

12

recover damages from a superior officer for alleged

13

constitutional violations* a holding that the District

14

Court here described as an overbroad statement.

15

The courts below relied on this Court's

16-

statement in Chappell that military personnel are not

17

barred from ail redress in civilian courts for

18

constitutional wrongs.

19

that statement* which was followed by citations to three

20

cases that did not involve claims for damages.

21

least three other Courts of Appeals have concluded* this

22

Court in Chappell clearly held that servicemen may not

23

pursue Bivens actions while Indicating by the statement

24

relied on by the courts below that in some cases they

25

may grant other sorts of relief.

The courts obviously misread

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

As at

We do not think that courts should frequently
grant other sorts of relief to military personnel* but
we acknowledge that this Court has left open that
possibility in extreme cases*

Proceeding to their case

by case inquiry* the courts below concluded that the
concerns underlying Feres and Chappell are not relevant
here because respondent was not ordered to take LSD*
While we do not think that any case by case inquiry is
warranted* It is nevertheless clear that the courts
below erred In reaching their conclusion*

The concerns

underlying Feres are not limited to cases involving
direct orders* and It is not clear where the District
Court got Its contrary idea*

This Court's decision in

Feres nor this Court's decision in Shearer nor aost of
the Feres cases in between Involved any sort of direct
order.

This Court's aade clear that the rule of Feres

is based on the principle that the military is under the
control of the political branches and that the Judiciary
should generally not review military decisions since
such litigation would undermine military discipline and
effectiveness.

This Court's decision in Shearer Is

particularly instructive*

The Court there concluded

that a claim against the Army based on Its alleged
failure to discharge or supervise a serviceman who had
previously been convicted of manslaughter would require
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the courts to review a decision of command and would

2

call into question basic choices about the supervision

3

and control of servicemen*
It could not be more clear that this case

4
5

involves such questions*

The heart of respondent's

6

claim is that the Army should not have been using

7

servicemen to study the effects of LSD and that it made

8

a number of mistakes in the way it conducted those

9

tests*

Respondent Is therefore challenging decisions of

10

command and calling into question basic decisions made

11

by the Army in the 1950s concerning the use of military

12

personnel*

If there are no further questions* I would

like to reserve the remainder of ny time*
