we want you to legally discriminate against women*

If the local club Is subject to the Unruh Act»

then so is International for compelling it to violate

local club?

HR* SUTTER*

15

I'm saying that if the local clubs — every

No» I'm not saying that precisely*

16

local club in California Is entitled to exclude women»

17

and it's only the local club that women or anyone else

18

can belong to» because there are no individual members

19

of International» if it is only the local club to which

20

they can belong» and If each of those clubs

21

independently can exclude women» then the fact that the

22

International says» great» we want you to exclude women!

23

you must exclude women if you are to call yourself

24

Rotary — now you can admit women! you can be a local

25

service club! you can do any of those things on your own

~ but it is only local clubs which have voluntarily

2

agreed not to adult women that can call themselves

3

Rotary because they have made that agreement among

4

themse t ves•

5

Now» I don't think that their making that

6

agreement can cause the International to be violative of

7

the Unruh Act if they are not violative of the Unruh

Act*

Now if they are» then It is.

10

QUESTICN.

Yes» but you may be mixing up the

11

statutory and the constitutional questions.

12

violate the Unruh Act by what they do.

13

would be» well» they have a constitutional right to

15

making them that decision.

Maybe they

But your answer

And it may well be the International violates

17

the Unruh Act by cancelling their franchises.

18

it necessarily follow they have a constitutional right

to cancel their franchise?

six separate and distinct occasions.

2

I submit that this case* as the statute of

3

California was construed by the Court of Appeal — now

4

the statute could have been written differently»

5

perhaps» or coulc have been construed differently.

6

the Court of Appeal felt that in order to fine

7

International violative of the statute» it had also to

8

find» and it did find» Duarte violative of the statute.

9

But

In doing that» I submit that it found that ail

10

California clubs would violate the statute

11

didn’t — if they adhered voluntarily to the

12

International provision that they must exclude women.

13

If International

can't enforce

if they

it against

14

Duarte» how can they voluntarily sustain it vis-a-vis

16

QUESTIONS

But hr. Sutter» maybe that's

17

correct as a matter of

18

this case.

logic» but I'm not sure that's

19

Because this case» as I understana

20

California courts held that the International violated

21

the California statute.

it» the

22

What they did was a statutory violation.

23

MR. SUTTERS

24

QUESTIONS

25

MR. SUTTERS

Yes.
And you're arguing —
They also held that Duarte did»
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

or they also held that Duarte was subject to the Unruh

2

Act and could not exclude women.

3

QUESTION;

Well» that may bey but that's

4

dtctay because they're not excluding women.

5

this casey because they voluntarily admitted women.

That's not

6

What they held was a violation of the statutey

7

as I understandy insofar as the judgment has any effecty

8

is what the International did.

9

It seems to me you have to be able to argue

10

that the International had a constitutional right to

11

violate the California statute In the way that it did.

12

MR. SUTTER;

I say that it does — that the

13

right of the International turns on the nature of the

14

California clubs.

15

That's all I'm saying.

If the California clubs themselves have the

16

right to violate the statute because they aren't subject

17

to tty then International has a right to violate the

18

statute because

19
20
21

22
23

it is a compact of those clubs.

It has no separate membership.

There's no

statutory right of anybody to belong to International.
The statute doesn't address the subject of
clubs belonging to an international federation.
QUESTIONS

Welly yes it doesy because

24

California has held it does.

25

on its face as you read ity but It has held that the

I mean» maybe it doesn't

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

International does not have the right to expel this

2

particular club.

3

HR. SUTTERS

It has held that.

Yes» it has

4

held that.

5

Court of Appeals said that it held that — based on the

6

character of the local club.

7

But I say that it has held that — and the

All I'm saying is that the character of the

8

local club is Integral to a decision as to the

9

International.

10

QUESTICN;

(Inaudible)

if International

11

doesn't have any members of its own* it's hard to frame

12

a constitutional argument on the right of association

13

for the International* isn't it?

14

MR. SUTTER;

I'm attempting to frame an

15

argument on behalf of the members of the local clubs*

16

because what I say is that this decision inherently

17

carries with it — it's not an express holding in this

18

case — inherently carries with It the decision that no

19

other California Rotary Club may properly exclude women.

20

If it doesn't hold that* or if that isn't

21

inherent in it*

22

overbreadth argument* which I didn't want to come to

23

here* and I realty didn't want to come to at all because

24

it's a latter argument* this statute then is so broad

25

that the language of the court that said Duarte is a

QUESTION;

HR* SUTTER;

Well» I was just wondering*
No» my point is not whether all

3

California clubs should admit women or should not»

4

clearly*

It might be a very good thing if they all did.

5

Hy point is whether the Duarte case» this

6

case» and the California Court of Appeals decision»

7

compels them to admit women.

8
9

Under the Unruh Act» applying the Unruh Act»
it is my contention that they must admit women*

But it

10

is also my contention that applying the Unruh Act to the

11

case that everybody talks about as either being

The

Yes* the Court of Appeals —
And they thought that would be

club?

15

nS. RESNIK.

The Court of Appeals found that

16

both the International and the local* in dicta* was a

17

businesslike organization; and therefore* under

18

California's interpretation of Its statute* that both of

19

these organizations had sufficient businesslike

attributes so as to be regulated by the State of

California's antidiscrimination laws.

But the reason not to move beyond is that
