ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. AN6AR0LA * ESQ.*

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. ANGAROLAS

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it

10

please the Court* the issue in this case is whether the

11

good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should be

12

applied to a warrantless search conducted pursuant to a

13

presumptively valid statute later declared

14

unconst I tut Iona I •

15

Petitioners' position is that the Illinois

16

Supreme Court erred when it required suppression of

17

evidence seized in the search of a junkyard* thus

18

rejecting the state's position that the exclusionary

19

rule should not be applied where the search was made in

20

good faith reliance of a presumptively valid statute.

21

The Illinois statute is a comprehensive scheme

22

regulating used auto parts and auto metal dealers.

23

statute required that books and records be kept on the

24

premises and that the premises of the yard* the

25

junkyard* be available for Inspection in order to
determine the

13

MR. LARKIN.

If it was clear that it was

this fashion» there would be less of a likelihood that

he would bring a suppression motion.

However —

There would really be no point In

MR. LARKINS

No» because the benefits of

20

bringing a suppression motion» as the Court recognized

21

In Leon» are the termination of the case.

22

viewed outside the judicial system» it would be clear

23

that a judge should rule In the government's favor.

24

defense counsel is not going to be certain of that and

25

he will still bring his motion» but in addition» in

So even If

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

The

1

statutes like this you have the possibility of

2

challenging the statute in ways that you don't have in a

3

criminal case.

4

For example* a declaratory Judgment proceeding

5

can be brought* and that can be brought early on and

6

before the searches are executed* so It is possible to

7

have the substantive rules of Fourth Amendment law in a

8

case where there Is a statute rather than a warrant

9

authorizing the conduct to be clearly defined perhaps

10

even before any search occurs.

11

decision Is clearly settled that it is permissible or

12

not* then you have an entirely different type of

13

calculus that goes Into play.

14

So In that case if the

The two substantive — the two central

15

principles that this Court adopted in Leon we believe

16

control this case.

17

exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct* and the

18

second and related one Is that the exclusionary rule

19

will not serve that purpose where a police officer acts

20

in an objectively reasonable fashion.

21

The first is that the purpose of the

In those circumstances the officer acts as any

22

other officer would* and Imposing the remedy of

23

exclusion penalizes the officer and the government

24

without producing any corresponding benefit to the

25

privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now* although the question in this case involves the

2

application of those principles that were adopted in

3

Leon to a slightly different factual situation* we

4

believe those principles are fully controlling here.

5

That* I believe* is clear when you look at the question

6

from the perspective of the officer attempting to

7

execute the search.
An officer in making the decision whether an

8
9

arrest or a search Is lawful

is concerned about the

10

substantive rules defining his conduct* what he is

11

permitted to do and what he is not permitted to do.

12

is not as concerned about who authorizes him to take

13

certain actions.

14

indifferent as to whether it is a magistrate that has

15

authorized him to enter this business or whether It is

16

the legislature that has.

18

In this respect the officer will be

s ta tute •
MR. LARKINS

22

There are circumstances where a

23

statute is clearly unconstitutional and no reasonable

24

person should believe that any court would rule

25

otherwise.

A specific example* I suppose* might be the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

statute in the Torres case, but where a legislature has

2

made a reasonable Judgment, and the legislature Is

3

required to make an independent Judgment as to the

4

constitutionality of its statutes. If it Is reasonable
*

5

the purposes served by the exclusionary rule will not be

6

served by suppressing the evidence in that case*

7

QUESTIONS

And If there is a single trial

court decision In the Jurisdiction holding it

9

unconstitutional would that then bind all police

10

officers or would we make an inquiry Into whether the

11

officer knew of the trial court decision?

12

until it Is appealed, or what?
MR, LARKINS

13

Or do we wait

How do you apply that?

There are several different

14

responses that I can give to that question*

terms of whether the officer knows about It, I think the

16

officer should be deemed to know of a decision from the

17

day it comes down.

19

arbitrary to say that the officer is entitled to 30

NR. LARKINS

As we construe Footnote 8 In

15

Leon* the Court there said that its substantive Fourth

16

Amendment rulings in its earlier cases were not affected

17

by adoption of the good faith exception* but that the

18

good faith exception would require the Courts if this

good faith were applied to a statutory search to make

20

the inquiry whether a particular search was reasonable.

QUESTION;

The sovereign

MS* MIQUELON*

7

That's true* and that was done

8

in this case*

The Illinois Supreme Court and the trial

9

court determined the statute was unconstitutional*

I

10

would also say that the good faith exception to the

11

excI us iona ry'ruIe as articulated by this Court in the

12

Leon decision is Intrinsically tied to the warrant and

13

probable cause requirements*
It assumes In the first instance that a

14
15

magistrate first reviews the affidavit containing the

16

officer's statement of probable cause* makes a probable

17

cause determination* and then issues the warrant* and as

18

a caveat to that* the Court says* you must act within

19

the confines of the warrant* which In this case the

20

officer didn't even act within the confines of the

21

regulatory scheme*

exclusion doesn't really extend beyond the warrant

3

4

defined a number of situations which* you know* probably

5
