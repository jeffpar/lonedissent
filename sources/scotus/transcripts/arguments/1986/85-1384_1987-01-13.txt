The question is, to what extent can we

14
15

restrict the rights of inmates while they are

16

incarcerated.

17

This Court, in previous First Amendment cases

18

and prison cases, has used an analysis -- I’m using, to

19

be precise, Procunier v. Martinez — has used an

20

analysis which presented the least restrictive

21

alternative -- which presented the rational relation

22

test.

23

By this examination, the Court required that

24

the decision of the correctional official be

25

demonstrated to be an exaggeration, an exaggerated

response to a legitimate penological interest

2

demonstrated by substantia] evidence on the record.

3

In determining whether the response has been

4

exaggerated, this Court has examined a number of -- a

5

number of factors.

6

They first examined -- identified the

7

penological interest involved, whether it was a security

8

interest, rehabilitation of inmates, whether it was

9

deterrence of crime or the maintenance of internal

10

order, the Court would always identify.

11

In the present case, the petitioners presented

12

the -- the security interest as the predominant interest

13

in upholding of the -- in the upholding of our

14

regulation between inmate-and-inmate correspondence.

15

We also had some

rehabilitation interest, but

16

predominantly it was a security interest.

17

that this was an important issue, because we feel that

18

the control of communication between inmates in

19

institutions is critical to our control of not only

20

inmate -- inmate violence, but inmate gang control and

21

various other -- various other security interests that

22

we would have in isolating inmates between institutions

in Missouri.

In this present situation, as to that

going in to the same inmate from the same civilian.

For

example, if a civilian starts to write

five or six different inmates, you begin tc get the idea

QUESTION:

You think that's easier to handle

than just looking at the direct inmate correspondence?
MR.

HERSCHEL:

Yes, we believe it be easier,

4

because we believe it be less — basically, most

5

civilians won't get involved

6

in that kind cf a thing.

I mean, we're -- we're basically -- you're

kind of illegal activity between an inmate -- two

almost always have to use a third party to help them

1

Both marriage and correspondence were denied

at Renz Correctional Center under a vague, best

5

effectively what happens is that Mr. Turner and the

themselves the right to decide which of their charges

In this particular case, we found that there

FINCH:

No, I think you started this.
Well, I made a mistake then.

8

was very little evidence to support the arguments of the

9

State of Missouri.
In regard to correspondence, for example,

10
11

there was a contention made that we promuloated this

12

rule because of security.

13

trial was that none of the letters which were stopped

14

were stopped for a reason having anything to do with

15

security.

16

But in fact the evidence at

In fact, when inmates asked to correspond,

17

there was no discussion, no going back and reviewing the

18

file about whether or not this particular inmate might

19

pose a threat to the inmate he's corresponding with or

20

someone else.

21

The flat rule that was stated in the Renz

22

Correctional Center handbook is:

23

correspond with anybody who is not a family member.

24
25

Inmates may not

So we had in this case a flat denial of
correspondence between particular inmates who had no

2

friendship.
In fact. Justice Marshall, your point was well

3
4

taken about the State’s concession, that there was no

5

alternative means of communication between these

6

inmates.
That, in fact, was the case.

7

If an inmate

8

wanted to write to a friend he knew on the outside, fcr

9

example, at Renz, the rule as applied would not let that

10

inmate correspond.
QUESTION;

11

12

Mr. Finch, I still don’t understand

how this argument goes to whether the rule is valid.
What you’re telling me was that the rule was

13
14

not being applied fairly.

It was not being applied in

15

such a way that you are allowed to correspond, as the

16

rule said you would and as we’ve been told was the

17

purpose, as long as there was no security problem.
But that means that the administration of it

18
19

was bad.

20

here, it says the rule is bad, even if it were honestly

21

applied.

22
23
24
25

And as I read the opinion that we’re reviewing

And isn’t that what you’re arguing, that the
rule is bad?
MR.

FINCH;

am, because you give too

much -- you give too much vagueness when you put in a

standard of best interests.
There is no standard to guide the prison

2
3

administrator.

They have other rules which allow the

4

prison administration to stop correspondence which, say,

5

is writing about escape attempts or a fraud of some

6

kind.

All of those things are covered.
But

7

the vague best interests standard allows

8

the prison administrator to do anything he darn well

what the prison is trying to do is to

So we're simply going to eliminate the

correspondence between bad actors.
Now, for all we know, the examples you give,

8
9

although the particular letter was quite harmless, that

10

letter may have come from a very bad actor, from a gang

11

head in another prison.

12

MR.

FINCH;

Isn't that possible.

Justice Scalia, I'm afraid there's

13

no evidence of that in this case.

The State never

14

presented testimony that the particular correspondent

15

was a member of a gang or had any reason to cause any

16

harm to the security of either institution.
These were simply letters of friendship, many

17
18

of them simply love letters between a female inmate at

19

Renz and a male inmate someplace else.
ftnd

20

I stress, this

is the only institution

21

where you have this problem.

If a male inmate at the

22

Missouri State Prison wanted

to write to a male inmate

23

at Moberly, that sort of correspondence was routinely

24

allowed.

25

Now, perhaps the State could impose

which was cited in the briefs in this case

So the effect of this rule is, you stop most

5
6

of the prisoners in Missouri who don’t cause any

7

problems from corresponding,

8

read their mail, because some of them might be gang

9

members.
And

I think under those circumstances, if the

we don't see anything here that's wrong with this

someone who's not a gang member.

20

But the rule you suggest, allowing all

correspondence to be denied for particular inmates,

22

would still suffer from that vice.

That channel of communication is

And we view that as authority for the position

14

we're arguing in this case.

When Leonard Safley, one of

15

the named plaintiffs, wanted to write a letter to his

16

fiancee, P.J. Watson, it didn't do any good to tell him

17

he might be able to write to somebody else, because he

18

had a particular target of that correspondence.
And Jones recognizes that that existence of no

19
20

other alternative is what's important.

The Court did

21

use a least restrictive analysis in Jones as regards to

22

the First Amendment issue.
And I'd also point out that the Court said,

23
24

First Amendment rights are barely at issue in this

not inconsistent with incarceration.
And the State's conceded that they let at

that the mere fact of correspondence is not inconsistent

with incarcer ation .

not be taken away by State statute.

And the ability of a person to marry the

22

person of his choice also should not be taken away by

23

State statute.

So long as this Court recognizes in its

25

opinions that inmates retain certain rights, then

they have no correspondence rights, they have no

10

But

11

inmates have no rights and,

in the Shabazz case that’s coming
they have no religious rights,
there won't be nearly as

of course the Court has never accepted

such a broad proposition.
QUESTION:

12

in this case,

What we have --

Well, the Court has accepted, of

13

course, the fact that a convicted felon can be deprived

14

of his liberty, and his opportunity to live with his

15

family.

And

And these are very fundamental rights.

I guess I’ll have to answer yes.k
Which is a remarkable proposition,

I think .
MR.

FINCH:

Well, the prison system of this

22

country recognizes the importance of this communication

23

for rehabilitation of an inmate.

25

The regulations that were in effect in this
case, in their preamble clauses, always said that

2

something to look toward to.

As I mentioned, many of these letters --

QUESTION:

But the rule itself says that a

6

inmate-to-inmate correspondence if it's determined to be

7

in his best interests, or hers.

8

MR.

FINCH;

QUESTION;

Yes, that’s right.
And we’re talking about the

10

validity of the rule facially.

11

with that rule, facially.

12

MR.

FINCH;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR.

FINCH;

And what’s the matter

Because it is unduly vague.
Under your theory.
Ma’am,

under my -- excuse me,

15

Justice O’Connor, under my theory, it's wrong because it

16

gives too much discretion to prison authorities to deny

17

a letter solely because they don’t like the content.

18

And in fact, there was one letter which was stopped

19

because the prison administrators did not like the

20

content of what was said.
There was other correspondence that was

21

22

stopped because a

former inmate who’d been released from

23

prison was a quote writ writer, unquote, and the prison

24

authorities didn’t want her writing back in to her

MR.

3

So the facial challenge boils down

ma’am.

Yes, sir -- excuse me, yes,

I apologize.
The other issue, of course, in this case is

6

the right of prison officials to stop inmates from

7

marrying one another.

8
9

The State has correctly pointed out that there
are inmates under the prior rule and under the current

10

-- well, I guess there have been three rules in effect.

11

The first rule was a rule that said inmates -- basically

as soon as the prison

they want to share their life with someone, even if it's

only by mail.

MR. FINCH;

I don’t think that the religious

attributes of a marriage ceremony can be fairly equated

11

with a fraternity ring.

12

It seems to me, sir, that we must also recall

13

that these inmates are not, in most cases, at least, in

mean that that marriage was any less important or
