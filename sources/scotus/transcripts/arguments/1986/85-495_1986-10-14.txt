Nov, the essential facts in this case

are as

follows;

7

The respondent, Ronald Philbrook, is a public

8

high school teacher, employed by the petitioner,

9

School Board, as a business teacher.

10

Ansonia

Since 1968, Philbrook has been a member of the

11

Worldwide Church of God, and as such, he is required by

12

his faith to absent himself for approximately six days a

13

year from his employment to observe religious holy days.

14

Under the governing collective bargaining

15

agreement, all of the school board's teachers, including

16

Philbrook, are provided three days annual paid leave for

17

religious observance.

18

Teachers are also provided under the agreement

19

with 18 days of annual leave for other reasons, such as

20

illness.

21

days per occurrence per reason.

22

And these are confined to specific numbers of

Teachers are also provided, in addition to the

23

three days for religious observance and the 18 days of

annual leave, with three days of annual leave for

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

Under the specific provisions of the
bargaining agreement, these days may not be used for any
reason for which leave is otherwise provided under the
bargaining agreement.

And they may be used only for

reasons which require a teacher's absence from work.
QUESTIONi

Is that so during the entire period

here ?
MR. SULLIVAN!

No, it wasn't.

Your Honor,

early on in the bargaining relationship between the
union and the school board, the leave provisions were
more lenient in that respect.
QUESTION!

Between, what was it --

SR. SULLIVAN.*
QUESTION!

'67 and

'68.

-- '67 and '69, they could use

those three days, as far as we know, for anything they
wanted?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION!

That's correct.

But nonetheless, Philbrook was not

allowed to use it for religious reasons.
MR. SULLIVAHi
that.

The record is not clear on

The evidence in terms of Philbrook*s absences for

religion relate back tc the 1970-71 school year, which
you can see set forth in the appendix to cur brief.
The record is not clear in this case as to how

he was treated prior to that time.

understanding that he was allowed, up until the 1970-71

2

school year, all of the leave he needed, witfj pay, fcr

3

religious observance.

4

So that the change came when the parties to

5

the bargaining agreement negotiated specific

6

restrictions on the use of personal leave.

7

Now, because the bargaining agreement --

8

QUESTION;

9

Counsel, is it possible, since the

court below didn't really decide these factual questions

10

on how the three-day personal leave provision was in

11

fact administered, or how Mr. Philbrook was treated with

12

regard to it, that some remand might be necessary cn the

13

703 issue?

14

MR. SULLIVAN;

Your Honor, we don't think so,

15

and for this reason;

16

case permits no other conclusion than that the leave

17

provisions of the contract have been consistently

18

interpreted in accordance with the explicit provisions

19

of the contract so as to preclude the use of necessary

20

personal business leave.

21

really talking about here, those three days which

22

Philbrook claims ought to be allowed for religious

23

observance.

we don’t agree with that. Your

The one day that the teacher can use by only

10

stating the reason is a personal reason still can only

11

be used under the contract fcr reasons which require the

12

teacher’s absence from work.

13

And that one day, even though discretionary in

14

the sense that the teacher need only state, it’s for a

15

personal reason, cannot be used for one of the reasons

16

for which leave is otherwise provided.

17

We feel the contract is clear on that.

2

the day was improperly used.

3

QUESTION;

What’s the purpose of the

4

provision, that one day provision?

5

something so confidential that the teacher wouldn’t want

6

to spread it on the record, or something of that sort?

7

MR. SULLIVAN:

That it may be

We don’t have any bargaining

8

history on that, so it’s simply a matter cf conjecture.

9

But I would say.

In collective bargaining agreements,

10

personal day leave provisions, it’s not unusual to give

11

a teacher a dicretionary day, because the reason may be

12

so personal as to cause embarrassment if it’s shared

13

with anyone else.

14
15

But it still must be a day that requires the
teacher’s absence from work.

QUESTION:

Well, what dees it mean, require to

be away from work?

4

MS. SULLIVAN:

The interpretation cf the

5

contract, as indicated by the superintendant of schools

6

in his testimony, is that the reason for the leave must

7

concern a matter than cannot be handled outside the

8

workday.

9

So in that sense, it's necessary personal

10

business.

11

outside of work to conduct that particular business.

In other words, arrangements cannot be made

made on another day, then that might very well
constitute necessary personal business.
Now, because the bargaining agreement limits
paid leave for religious observance to three days per
year, and Philbrook generally needs more, the school
board has allowed Philbrook the additional time off
without pay.
Dissatisfied with this arrangement, and having
satisfied the jurisdictional requirements, Philbrock
brought suit in District Court, claiming a violation of
Title VII, as well as the First Amendment, based on the
school beard’s failure to compensate him in some way for
all of his days of leave caused for religious observance.
The District Court found no discrimination,
and dismissed the.com plaint .
The Court of Appeals reversed, deciding only
the statutory issue, and remanded for a determination as
to whether any of the accommodations proposed by
Philbrook could be implemented without undue hardships.
And those proposed accommodations essentially
involved the use of those three necessary personal leave
days for religious observance, or the payment of the
cost of a substitute teacher, which would have lessened
the economic impact on Philbrook for having to take that

Philbrook had also proposed that he be allowed

2

to do some other meaningful

3

of those accommodations.

4

In

work in conjunction with cne

reversing the District Court and remanding

5

the case, the Court of Appeals held that Title VII

reguires an employer to accept an employee’s proposed

accommodation, where the employer and the employee each

reasonable beliefs.

10

QUESTION*

11
12

Didn’t

they say, unless there was

undue hardship, or something like that?
MR. SULLIVAN*

Yes, the Court of Appeals

13

viewed the reasonable acccmmcdaticn provisions as

14

necessarily having to involve a determinaticn of undue

15

hardship on the employer, the theory apparently being

16

that unless there is seme hardship, short of undue

Isn’t that what the EEOC

This Court has, of course, stated cn several

2
3

occasions that the EEOC guidelines do not have the force

of law.

5

particular respect, are in conflict with

6

language of the statute.

7

And we feel that the guidelines, in that
the plain

Title VII makes it an unlawful employment

8

practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or

discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate

10

against any individual with respect to his compensation,

11

terms, or conditions, or privileges of employment,

12

because cf such individual’s religion.

13

The statute defines religion to include all

14

aspects cf religious observance and practice, as well as

15

belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is

16

unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s or

17

prospective employee's observance or practice without

18

undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Sullivan, hew would you define

what is a reaonable accommodation under Title VII?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, I would define a

22

reasonable accommodation as one that resolves the

23

conflict between the employee’s religious needs, in this

24

case in terms of religious observance, and his job

25

requirements.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And that is, I think, the crucial factor in

this case.

accommodation, which resolves the conflict letween

4

Philbrock's need to be on the job and his need for

5

religious observance, a reasonable accommodation has

6

been made.

7

8

Because the employer has implemented an

And the statute has been satisfied as a
result.

9

Consequently, we feel that the Eistrict Court

10

was correct in determining that Philbrook had not

11

established a prima facie case of discriminaticn .

12

Now, the Court in doing that implemented a

13

three-prcr.ged test to determine whether or net there was

14

a prima facie case of discrimination in this case.

15

First of all, the Court said;

Is there a

16

conflict between the employee's religious needs and the

17

job requirements?

18
19

Secondly, has the employer informed the
employee of this conduct?

20

And thirdly, has the employee been disciplined

21

as a result of a failure to comply with the job

22

requirements.

23
24

In

this case, we feel there's nc conflict, as

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

And thirdly, there's been no discipline in any

1

2

sense.

Certainly Philbrock's not been discharged frcm

3

his employment.

4

to which he would otherwise have been entitled except

5

for his religion.

He's not been deprived of any benefit

6

He's not been disciplined in any way.

QUESTION:

Would ycu take the position, Mr.

view?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Because the three-prcng test of religious --

not met in this case --

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Excuse me, because this ties in

with what Justice O'Connor just asked.
You answered the way you did, I presume,

8

because the employer in that hypothetical is being -- is

9

treating both religious and nonreligious leave

10

eguivalently ?

11

HP. SULLIVANi

12

QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now, is he doing the same here?

13

How do we know that three days of leave fcr days of

14

rest, religiously required, how do we know that that's

15

enough, that that's equivalent to 18 days for

16

nonreligious reasons?

17
18
19

How do we know that that's an equivalent
treatment of religion?
HR. SULLIVAN;

Well, we don't.

I'm not sure

20

that the mere fact that the leave provisions are

21

under-inclusive, in the sense that they dc net provide

22

Philbrook all the leave he needs for religious

23

observance, is determinative of the issue.

24
25

QUESTION:

Oh, it isn't that they don't

provide him all that he needs.

The issue is whether,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

without the use of those three other days, the employer

2

is treating religious leave and leave for other than

3

religious purposes equally.

4

And I look at it.

And gee, there are only

5

three days for religion, and there are 18 days for ether

6

than religion.

7

hypothetical that Justice O’Connor gave you, where you

8

get no leave for any reason; no paid leave for either

9

religion or ncnreligion.

10

So we really don’t have the kind of

'Well, Your Honor, I don’t

that kind of equal treatment.
What Title VII indicates is that employees

know that three days is enough to make it

MR. SULLIVAN;

At

How do you

I would agree that there would

11

be some point where, on the face of the bargaining

12

agreement, so much acccmmcdaticn has been made to

13

secular needs, and so little accommodation made to

14

religious needs, that on the face of the previsions, the

15

leave previsions are discriminatory.

16

I do not believe that this is a case like that.

17

QUESTION:

Maybe not.

I just don’t know what

18

the test is.

19

estimate by these who bargained in the collective

20

bargaining agreement as to how much time off the average

21

employee needs for all these other purposes.

22

they figured it all out, the average employees needs 18

23

days for nonreligious, and three days for religious?

24

Is the test, perhaps, that there was some

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

There’s

no bargaining history to indicate why the parties
through the years structured this kind of a leave
provision .
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Sullivan, it isn’t quite

right, is it, that the normal employee would get all 18
days?

For example, it’s not every year that you have a

death in the immediate family, a family funeral to —
all those, I assume, happen infrequently rather than
regularly.
MR. SULLIVAN;
correct, and

Your Honor, I think that’s

I think that’s important in determining the

reasonableness of the leave provisions in this
particular case.
QUESTION:

And isn’t it true that except for

the three days of personal leave, each of the other 15
days is earmarked for a specific, narrow purpose?
MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

And so

the question is whether you

can impose the limit on the

three days for personal

leave provision.
MR. SULLIVAN:

And of course that limit is no

different from the limit imposed on the other reasons
for which leave is provided.
I would also say this, and the record

The ether leaves may or may not occur.

5

Certainly the necessary personal business leave may

7

QUESTION;

Mr. Sullivan, would an employer's

8

policy that just says, across the board, no personal

9

leave for anyone for any purpose, meet the requirements

10

of Title VII

11
12

for religious accommodation?

MR. SULLIVAN:

No leave for any purpose or fer

any reason?

13

QUESTION;

Right.

14

MR. SULLIVAN;

I would say that in that case

15

there would still be a duty on the part of the employer

16

to attempt to accommodate the employee's religious

17

beliefs.

18

QUESTION;

May I ask one other question?

Does

19

the record tell us how frequently, for the work force in

20

general, the personal leave privilege was exercised?

21

I noticed for eight years in a row, the

22

respondent didn't take any personal leave.

23

employees take some?;

MR. SULLIVAN;

Honor, that fer the last year, the most recent year for

which we have any information, in 1983-84, which is the

2

year that impacted the time of trial, two teachers, out

3

of a total of 153, had used all of their necessary

4

personal business leave days.
So the record indicates that these days are

5

net frequently used.

QUESTION;

And what would you say if the

employer gave paid leave only to people who wanted off

for religious purposes?

for any other reason.

No paid leave for anybody else
Now, is that -- could you dc that?

No paid leave for any reason,

I’d like to also address the statutory

terms of allowing a person tc resolve that conflict
between their religious practices and their employment
obligations in a manner which allows them to continue

I think that the cases the Second Circuit
talks about, or those termination cases, where clearly
there was no reasonable accommodation or there’s a
reason to inquire whether there was a reasonable
accommodation, or whether something could have been to
allow a reasonable accommodation, in the sense of
allowing an employee tc continue in his employment and
observe his religious obligations.
I’d also like tc speak to a claim that Hr.
Philbrook makes that he is really in a situation of
substantial pay, no work.

I submit that the only

evidence referred to by Mr. Philbrook is three pages of
the transcript which have nothing to do with that which
merely state that there was education going cn because
he had a plan for the students to following during the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID N. ROSEN, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

11
12

MR. ROSEN;

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Anscnia has drawn an explicitly religious line

13
14

through its personal leave rule, disfavoring religious

15

exercise, prohibiting religious exercise.
This explicitly religious line is

16
17

presumptively unlawful, and there were no findings

18

addressing or supporting the claims of lawfulness of

19

this explicitly religious line that were made by

20

District Court.
QUESTION;

21

the

Why is it an explicitly religious

22

line?

As I understand their scheme, you can use these

23

three days for anything, religious or non religio us, sc

24

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, there are some things for which days have

2

been specifically provided for that are secular, and

3

there are other things that are religious, it seems to

4

me .

5

MR. ROSEN;

Your understanding — I have to

6

disagree with the understanding you were given a ccuple

7

of minutes ago.

8

9

The contracts, all of the contracts, say that
personal leave may not be used not only for mandatory

10

religious observance, which is specifically provided for

11

in the religious leave, but also may not be used for

12

quote any religious observance unquote.
Those are the more recent contracts.

13

The

14

earlier contracts used similar language, saying that

15

personal leave cannot be used for, quote, any religious

16

activity.

17

So what I would call the claim of neutrality

18

between religious and secular uses, that is, that a

19

neutral reason has been chosen for excluding religion

20

from the ambit of personal leave, is in fact

21

nonexistent.

/

22

In this contract, these contracts, because the

23

provisions aren't parallel --

(202) 628-9300

1

unfairness remains, which is — can be seen by taking

2

the example of Hr. Philbrook and a colleague, each of

3

whom uses the three days for religious holidays to

4

satisfy religious needs.

5

The hypothetical colleague then uses the

6

fourth day to fulfill, let us say, a deeply held but

7

nonreligious ethical commitment to aid the poor by

8

working in a soup kitchen.

9

use of personal business leave.

10
11

This would be permissible

The teacher would simply note the use of
personal business leave.

12

Hr. Philbrook could not work beside his

13

colleague in the soup kitchen if that work in the soup

14

kitchen were part of a religious holy day obligation of

15

his church, if the soup kitchen were sponsored by his

16

church .

17

So the line is an explicit religious line.

18

There are no findings in the District Court to uphold

19

that line.

20

QUESTION:

Is it as clear as you suggest that

21

this personal religious thing that is embraced within

22

the 18 days might not be extended to the soup kitchen

23

example, if Mr. Philbrook felt a religious desire to dc

24

that?

about your facial reading of the contract?
I happen to have the contract in the cert

16

most recent one.
If you eliminated

17

the provision for mandated

18

religious observance in paragraph 10, and also

19

eliminated subparagraph 4 of the exclusion for any

20

religious observance, but retained the exclusion for all

21

other purposes set forth in the agreement , would that

contract then avoid violating Title VII?

MR. ROSEN:

of a breakdown is inherently discriminatory under Title

MR. ROSEN;

All right.

The difference, as I

see it, is that it’s legitimate of the state or the

employer to make any limits it wants on all these other

25

categories without running afoul of religious

2

With regard to the religious di criminaticn

3

provisions, however, the employer is limited even if --

4

even if it has drawn the line which also applies to the

5

other categories, it is still going along saying, nc

6

religion allowed.

7

This creates the same problems cf excluding

8

religion because it is religious; excluding activities

9

which are identical because of their motivation;

10

excluding Mr. Philbrook from using a religious holy day

11

to observe or commemorate the death cf a loved one,

12

although his cc-employee could take such a similar

commemeoration by going to a gravesite, sc long as the

Thank you.

FOR THE UNITED STATES AND EEOC, AS AMICI CURIAE,

MR. FRIED;

may it please the Court;

role.

We are the principal enforcer of Title VII, and

10

we are also the nation’s largest employer subject to the

11

strictures of Title VII.
So it’s important for us to get it right, and

12
13

to situate Title VII within the constitutional landscape

14

of the two religion clauses.
The free exercise clause sets the floor on the

15
16

matter.

It’s addressed to prohibitions, prohibitions cn

17

belief and exercise, and by extension, to discriminatory

18

treatment — discriminatory treatment of religion and

19

religious exercise.

20

After that, we believe there is wide room for

21

accommodation by government, as for instance, 5 U.S.C.

22

550a, which deals with religious observance by federal

employees.

20

Well, might that be another issue

21

that it would be well to have clarified, if there is a

22

remand ?

23

HR. FRIED:

Oh, no doubt.

No doubt.

And that

24

is why we support a remand.

Since there's an

25

alternative reading of that provision, which would be
46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

quite unexceptionable in terms of dicriminatcry

2

treatment.

3

It may be that those three days are intended

4

for quite narrow and nonrecurring events, things that

5

don't come around every year, regular as clockwork, or

6

regular as the calendar, and also which are not — which

7

are compelled by external compulsion.

8

In that event, if that is what we find on

9

remand, then in our view there is no discriminatory

10
11

treatment.
There may however be discriminatory impact.

12

That is to say, as Philbrook has been claiming, that

13

because of his particular religious needs, this

14

provision bears on him in a more burdensome way than on

15

other persons; those without those religious needs, or

16

those with only three required religious holidays.

17

Now, as to discriminatory impact, it is cur■

18

view that it is only there that the duty of reasonable

19

accommodation comes in, and as to that duty, that is

20

where we part company with the Court of Appeals, and in

21

fact, join company with all the other Courts of Appeals

22

which have considered this matter.

23

And in our view, once we're talking about

24

reaonable accommodation, the only obligation that the

25

employer has is to offer a reasonable accommodation.

If

Nothing else is required.

without pay is not a reasonable accommodation.
But in the context of this case, it is

our

20

view that leave without pay is a reasonable

21

22

QUESTION;

It may also be that there's no
