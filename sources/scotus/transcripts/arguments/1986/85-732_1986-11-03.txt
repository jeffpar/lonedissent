2

Only the aircraft cf interstate airlines or

4

needless to say, no competing modes of transportation

5

are taxed insofar as their personal property is

6

concerned, such as buses or

And

taxis or rental cars.

Now, the state doesn’t deny that its system is

8

discriminatory and the state agrees, as I understand

9

them, that the purpose of 1513(d) is to prevent

10

discrimination.

11

taxed other commercial and industrial property in the

12

state, the assessment ratios and the tax rates could net

be any lower for that property than for air carrier

property.

15

And the state also admits that, if it

But the state says the kind of discrimination

16

it’s practicing in this case is permitted by the statute

17

because it’s exempting all other property from taxation,

18

rather than taxing it at a lover rate.

19

Dakota court has reached that conclusion lased on a

20

reading of 1513(d) which it says is clear and

21

unambiguous, so clear and unambiguous, apparently, there

22

was no need to even dwell upon the purpose of Congress

23

in enacting 1513(d), no need to even take a glance at

24

the legislative history of 1513(d), which the court did

25

not do, so clear aoparently no need to even consider an

opinion of the North Dakota

2

earlier which reached exactly the opposite ccnlusicn as

3

to the meaning of the statute on virtually the same

4

facts.

5

Supreme Court eight months

North Dakota had an airline flight property

6

tax and North Dakota exempted other property.

7

North Dakota court, in holding that the statute had teen

8

violated, noted that it was its duty to avoid what it

9

called ludicrous and absurd

10

And the

results.

Now, the language that South Dakota finds to

11

be so clear and unambiguous includes this key phrase;

12

"subject to a property tax levy."

13

in the definition of commercial and industrial property,

14

and that’s the comparison class for purposes of

15

determining whether there is discrimination.

16

That phrase appears

1513(d) says roughly this:

you shall not

17

assess air carrier property at a higher percentage of

18

true value than other commercial and industrial

19

property; second, you shall not tax air carrier property

20

at a higher rate than other commercial and industrial

21

property.

22

And commercial and industrial property is

23

defined in the statute, with few exceptions, as property

24

devoted to a commercial and

industrial use and subject

25

to a property tax levy, and

those are the key words.
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

And South Dakota says that means, that de finition means,

2

property that's being put to a co mmercial and industrial

3

use and is being taxes, as distin guished from capable of

4

being taxed.

2

In any case, the short of

it is that South

3

Dakota says, since there is no property being taxed in

4

the state, personal property, there is no property in

5

the comparison class, hence there's no violation of

6

1513(d).

7

Now, the first problem we have with that

8

analysis is the idea that the words "subject to a

9

property tax levy" are all that clear and unambiguous.

10

I mean, the words "subject to," as we all know, are

11

often used to refer to things that could happen as well

12

as things that have happened, like in the phrase

13

"subject to further order of the court," cr "subject to

14

change without notice," or "subject to high winds cr

15

flooding," or anything.

16
17
18

Those are all things that haven’t happened
yet.
QUESTION;

*You usually say "subject to

19

further order," just as here it would be more natural to

20

say "subject to property tax levy," rather than "subject

21

to a property tax levy," unless you're referring tc a

22

particular one that's in effect.

23

MR. RASENBERGER:

I think you cculd make

24

something out of that distinction, Justice Scalia, but

25

it seems to me that is locking at this with a semantic

(202) 628-9300

1

microscope, really, when Congress was painting a picture

2

here with very broad strokes.

3

As you look at the legislative history, you’ll

4

see that the kind of precision that you’re suggesting

5

went into the fixing of those words is lacking

6

everywhere else in this statute.

7

just wasn't that deliberate a choice as between "a" or

8

not using the letter "a".

9

QUESTION;

And I suggest that it

What do you think it means — what

10

is excluded if it does not refer to a particular

11

property tax?

12

what could constitutionally be subject to a property

13

tax?

14

What do you think was — Congress meant

MR. RASENBERGER;

I think it’s what could

15

constitutionally, and I think it was also probably meant

16

to exclude property that was traditionally nontaxable by

17

the states.

18

QUESTION;

What commercial or industrial

19

property wouldn’t constitutionally be subject to a

20

property tax levy, commercial or industrial property?

21

MR. RASENBERGERs

Well, there are commercial

22

properties being put to a commercial or industrial use

23

by the Federal Government that are not taxable.

24

are certain commercial properties of charitable

25

organizations that are not taxable in some states.

those are examples.

QUESTION;

Hell, but I*m not saying not

4

using the language, and you say it doesn't mean actually

5

6

subject, you're using actually subject to, and you're

7

telling us that is not what it means.

We're talking about Congress

When you say some states have not made it

You're telling us it has to mean
constitutionally it could be subject to, and you think

10

that what they're referring to is only federal property

11

that is being used for commercial or industrial

12

purposes.

13

examples ?

14

Such as what?

MR. RASENBERGER;

Give me, you knew, five

Could I answer it this way;

15

The words "subject to a property tax levy" entered the

16

statute quite long before the words "commercial and

17

industrial property."

18

like a

19

and in the course of that 15 years it was built sort of

20

brick by brick.

21

In other words, this statute had

15 year history before it finally cot enacted,

And the first brick, one of the early bricks

22

that went in there, were the words "subject to a

23

property tax levy."

24

course, the words "commercial or industrial property"

25

were not there.

And when they went in there, of

1

The reference class was all other property.

2

So it was all other property subject to a property tax

3

levy.

4

served a certain function, because otherwise all

5

property, federal lands in the West for example, would

6

theoretically have been covered within the comparison

class.

And in those circuit's t ances, the words obviously

QUESTION:

Rasenberger, at the time

that the language referred to all property, wasn't

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, charitable property wasn't

them that way,

QUESTION:

From the very beginning you
yes.

Well, that's kind of a curious

argument, because usually we think when Congress adds
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

new language like that it must be intended tc mean

2

something, and on your interpretation it wouldn’t.

3
4

MR. RASENBERGER;

Adds new language such as

"commercial and industrial property"?

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. RASENBERGER:

Adds language, yes.
When Congress added the

7

words "commercial and industrial property" it was trying

8

to narrow the comparison class to some extent, to get at

9

what they were really concerned about, which was

10

business property and not all other property.

11

fail to see hew choosing a narrower class makes the term

12

"subject to a property tax levy" mean something

13

different.

14

QUESTION;

But as

But I

I understand Justice

15

O’Connor’s question and your answer, you agreed that the

16

term "subject to a property tax levy" under your

17

argument was probably surplusage, that it really didn't

18

mean anything .

19

MR. RASENBERGER;

Yes.

The original phrase

20

was "subject tc the same property tax levy."

21

— the original bill was focused only on assessments.

22

That was the concern the railroads had.

23

assessments subject to the same property tax levy.

24
25

That was

And it was said

Later on the railroads began to realize that
that wasn’t the kind of protection they wanted, because
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

classifications of tax -- tax classifications could be

2

developed which made it possible to discriminate in

3

terms of assessments.

4

and have therefore a different assessment.

You could have a higher tax rate

5

So they went into the business cf adopting a

6

provision which would have protected against tax rates

7

being discriminatory, as well as assessments.

8

when 1(c) was added to the statute in 1967.

9
10

That’s

Have I answered the question?
QUESTION;

Well, as I understood Justice

11

O’Connor’s point, and it commends itself to me to a

12

certain extent, we don’t ordinarily -- we’re loath tc

13

say that a proviso or a clause in an act cf Congress is

14

just surplusage, that it really meant nothing.

15

NR. RASENBERGER;

I understand that, and I'm

16

saying it still means something even today.

17

the words "commercial and industrial property" exclude a

18

lot of otherwise non-taxable property, there is still

19

property devoted to a commercial or industrial use which

20

is not taxable.

21

QUESTION;

MR. RASENBERGER;

the

So it’s net surplusage

What the state is saying is that the adoption
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of the words "subject to" -- the adoption of the words

2

"commercial and industrial property" suddenly accomplish

3

a radical transformation in

4

that they suddenly created a different meaning for the

5

words "subject to a "property tax levy" than it had

6

before.

7

QUESTION;

the meaning of the statute,

That's a pretty fine line to draw

8

in a statute that you tell us was sort of thrown

9

together.

I mean, you say Congress was being so precise

10

that they thought, well, there is some little bit of

11

commercial and industrial property that can't be taxed,

12

namely federal facilities.

13

of that, but you told me that this was a pretty much

14

rush job, this statute.

15

it?

16

I would never have thought

That's fairly refined, isn't

MR. RA.S ENBERGER:

It was not a rush job in the

17

sense that it took place over a period of 15 years.

18

all I'm saying is, if you attribute the adoption of the

19

words "commercial and industrial" -- to those words,

20

"commercial and industrial property," a major change in

21

the meaning of the words "subject to a property tax

22

levy," there ought to be some basis for attributing

23

that.

24
25

But

I mean, why would Congress, at the same time
that it was narrowing the class to business property,
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

have created an opportunity for a huge exception for

2

business property?

3

basically arguing, that when you changed it from all of

4

the property to commercial and industrial property you

5

changed the meaning of the statute considerably, because

6

the words "subject to a property tax levy" thereafter

7

had no meaning.

8
9

And that’s what the state is

QUESTION:

Perhaps Congress wanted to leave to

states the availability of treating some commercial and

10

industrial property specially and not subjecting them to

11

a tax levy at all, such as in order to attract new

12

business or something of that sort.

13

possibility that Congress could have had in mind?

14

Isn’t that a

As you would have us read the statute, no

15

state could give an exemption or a lower rate in order

16

to attract new commercial enterprise within the state,

17

without at the same time applying that new rate to

18

interstate airlines.

19

MR . RASENBERGER;

20

into the total rate for all

21

I think that’s right.

22

QUESTION;

Well, averaging that rate
property in the state, yes,

But isn’t that a good reason for

23

Congress conceivably making that exception, that it’s

24

only property that is actually subject to a levy that

25

we’ve talking about?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. RASENBERGER:

Well, as I say, there is no

2

specific legislative history on the subject , except the

3

railroads at one time were asked what they thought the

4

term "subject to a property

5

the statements that was made I think was a significant

6

one.

7

tax levy" meant.

And cne of

One of the railroad representatives said that

8

the issue here is really state policy versus federal

9

policy, and the states can have their tax policies, they

10

can give tax breaks to people they want to give tax

11

breaks to.

But we have a federal policy as well.

12

And all that Congress is saying is that that

13

federal policy has to be — is such that if you give a

14

tax break to any commercial cr industrial user, that has

15

to be averaged into the way you treat interstate

16

carriers.

17

reasonable conclusion .

18

And it seems to me that that's a perfectly

What we do not have here in all this

19

legislative history is anything that says what Congress

20

meant by the words "subject to a property tax levy."

21

What we do have is what Congress meant to establish by

22

the statute, and I think that’s the key point.

23

you compare the words “subject to a property tax levy,"

24

which are totally unexplained, with the prohibition on

25

discrimination, which is very clearly explained.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F $T„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I mean,

1

Let me just read you a few lines out of one of

2

the early Senate reports, and this deals with the words

3

that permit -- that prohibit tax rate discrimination.

4

That's subparagraph

5

(c).

It say:

"The purpose of subparagraph (c ) is" to forbid

6

state or local classifications, whether based on

7

constitutional provisions, statutory enactment, or

8

administrative order or practice, which are designed or

9

have the effect of discriminating against carrier

10

transportation property."

11

Now, that we know

is what Congress meant by

13

scheme which has the effect clearly of discriminating

14

against carrier property.

We know that what we have in South Eakcta is a

And if we say these words "subject to a

Congress meant in the substantive provisions, ve're in

What happens when this case goes back on

MR. RASENBERGER;

They would have to develop

4

an average rate for personal property in the state that

5

is subject, that is eligible for taxation.

QUESTION:

Well, that really, you could argue,

that’s the tail wagging the dog the other way.

words, in order to enforce the federal mandate here that

there should

In other

be no discriminatory taxation of airline or

10

railroad property, a state has to subject to personal

11

property tax all of the personal property in the state

12

that it had decided to exempt.

13

MR. RASENBERGER:

The state has the option of

14

not taxing airlines.

15

whoever you want, you can give whatever tax breaks you

16

want, but you have to treat

17

average way you treat other business property.

18

QUESTION:

All the statute says, you can tax

airlines the same as the

Well, on that point, there is, of

19

course, a statutory exception for an in lieu tax which

is used for airport and aeronautical purposes.

it was an in lieu tax, on the theory that it wasn't in

13

That was

Why was it dropped?

MR. RASENBERGER i

Well, let me start by saying

14

it was put in for railroads at the very last minute in

the legislative history, because the railroads called to

the attention of the committee a gross receipts tax that

New York was imposing on the New York Dock Railway.

Wouldn't that make sense out of the statute?

And I guess I have said this before.

to me that if you're going to conclude that the shift of

12

the words from the assessment section to the definition

MR. MEIEP HENRY:

airlines, that operate interstate.

But the airline -- as far as you

know, the airframes are the only kind of personal

MR. MEIERHENRY;

That’s correct.

Cur statute,

the revenues derived by those taxes go into the general

MR. RASENBERGER;

All I'm saying is that it's

The other final point is, remember that this

22

is not just South Dakota that's involved cr just these

23

airlines.

24

have broad applicability to a lot of states which don't

25

have personal property taxes, which could imposes taxes

5

And if those states were to do that on

would basically simply create exactly the kind of

property tax discrimination that this whole project,

eliminate at the time and in conjunction with, as we
