ORAL ARGUMENT OF

JOHN H . HARIED, ESC.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. HARIED;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
In South Dakota versus Opperman and in

10

Illinois versus Lafayette, this Court held that

11

inventory searches are lawful if they are routinely

12

done, if they are done pursuant to standard police

13

procedures, and if they are done in furtherance of

14

legitimate governmental interests, and if they are not a

15

pretext for an investigative search.

16

This case is here on a writ of certiorari to

17

the Colorado Supreme Court to decide the narrow question

18

of whether during an otherwise lawful inventory search

19

of an automobile it is permissible for a police officer

20

to open and inventory closed containers.

21

QUESTION*

Mr. Haried, may I ask you a

22

preliminary question.

23

state urge below that the search would be valid under

24

Belton, a search incident to arrest?

25

MR. HARIED*

Did you urge below or did the

We did not urge that on the

interlocutory appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

2

3

Why not?

Do you think, it would

have been?

4

HR. HARIED;

Yes,

I do think it would have

5

been, if it had been done at the time of Hr. Rertine's

6

arrest.

7

or so after his arrest, after a dog control officer had

8

come and taken the dog out of Hr. Bertine's vehicle.

9

The facts were that it was done some 15 minutes

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't there a case from

10

Arizona that dealt with a delay, that recognized

11

concept of Belton, from this Court?

12

13

MR. HARIED:
not familiar

I do not know if there was.

I'm

QUESTION:

15

the state didn't pursue that.

16

MR. HARIED:

I was just very curious to know why

It was basically a decision of

17

the facts of this case, that the intent and the whole

18

thrust of the search was an

20

inventory, and that's the

The facts in this case are that the defendant

21

was stopped because of his erratic driving, and he was

22

eventually arrested for drunken driving.

23

to the Boulder police department for the booking

24

procedure and for a blood alcohol test.

25

He was taken

The police impounded his vehicle because where

1

it was left when he was arrested it was blocking traffic

2

on a busy street in the city of Boulder.

3

police department regulations provide for routine

4

inventory searches of impounded automobiles and their

5

cont en ts.

6

The Boulder

And during the search in this case, the police

7

officer found Nr. Bertine’s backpack on the floor,

8

picked it up and could tell that it contained personal

9

items, and he opened it to look for valuable or

10
11

dangerous items for inventory purposes.
And inside he found a hair brush, a heavy

12

metal flashlight, clothing, and he also found cocaine,

13

cocaine paraphernalia, Quaaludes, and f>7f)C in cash in

14

one container and $200 in cash in a separate container

15

on a pound on the outside of the backpack .

16

The trial court in this case made several

17

factual findings that are particularly important because

18

they help focus the issue on appeal.

19

found as a matter of fact that the decision to impound

20

this vehicle was made in good faith, and that it was

21

made for the purposes of protecting Mr. Bertine's

22

property, protecting the police from false claims of

23

theft, and protecting the police from dangerous items

24

that might have been inside of the backpack.

25

The trial court

And the trial court found that the officer
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

followed the standard inventory procedures and,

2

importantly,

3

not a pretext for an investigative search.

4

the trial court found that this search was

QUESTION;

Were there procedures in place for

5

when containers would be opened or whether they would or

6

anything of that sort?

7

MR. HARIED;

The Boulder police department

8

regulations provide that if

9

shall be inventoried, and the trial court made a finding

10
11

a vehicle is impounded it

that that meant opening closed containers.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record

12

that tells us what the policy is, other than that

13

general conclusion?

14

court supported by a written policy of any kind?

15

Was that conclusion of

MR. RARIED:

the trial

There is a writted policy.

16

found in the joint appendix

17

the language of it says that the vehicle and its

18

contents shall be inventoried.

19

It is

at page 88, and it speaks --

There was testimony, which is in the record,

20

that the usual practice of the Boulder police department

21

was to open closed containers in that situation.

22

QUESTION;

Was there any testimony by the

23

officers in question here to the effect that they had a

24

slightly different policy about whether to open

25

containers or not?

It just wasn’t all that clear to me

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

2

that there was a clearcut policy on this.
MR. HARIED:

I think

that the Boulder police

3

department requla tions don’t spell out in detail the

4

word "inventory.”

5

as the trial court did, you reach the conclusion, which

6

was the factual finding of the trial court, that

7

inventory means opening closed containers.

8
9

I think if you read them as a whole,

QUESTION:

Mr. Haried, what is the policy with

regard to locked containers?

10

MR. HARIED:

11

QUESTION:

12

You break the lock in all cases and

open the briefcase or whatever it might be?

13

MR. HARIED:

14

MR. HARIED:

17

It's the same policy.

That's correct.
Does the record show that?
I don’t believe that it does.

The trial court considered the search here

that it was a

But nonetheless, it suppressed the

an interlocutory appeal to the Colorado

23

Supreme Court, that court affirmed the trial court's

24

suppression of the evidence, but did not base its

25

decision on the Colorado constitution.

Instead, it

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

based it solely and squarely on the Fourth Amendment.

2

The Colorado Supreme Court specifically said that it did

3

not reach or

4

In

decide the state constitutional issue.
Illinois versus Lafayette, this Court held

5

that in the course of an otherwise lawful -- that during

6

an otherwise lawful inventory search at the booking

7

desk, it was permissible for police officers to open and

8

inventory closed containers.
And our position is that the same reasons that

9
10

supported the inventory of closed containers at the

11

booking desk in Lafayette apply with equal force here.

12

In both contexts, both at the booking desk and on the

13

street when a vehicle is impounded, the same basic thing

14

is happening.
The police in the exercise of their caretaking

15
16

function are taking physical custody of a citizen’s

17

property.

18

responsibility for that property, responsibility to

19

safeguard it, to keep it from being stolen or destroyed,

20

and the responsibility to protect against the risk of

21

harm from dangerous things that may be inside the

22

property.

23

25

And as a result, they are charged with

QUESTION’;

How would that justification apply

to a locked briefcase?
MR. HARIED;

I'm going to start from the
8

(202) 628-9300

1

premise that locked briefcases — not all locked

2

briefcases are totally secure.

3

types of locks and briefcases can be picked or

4

combinations can be opened, so that no container is

5

secure.

And there is —
QUESTION:

6

In other words, many

Yes, but if the police officer

7

noted on it it was a locked briefcase, presumably if it

8

was picked later, why, there wouldn't be any — I don't

9

understand.
MR. HARIED;

10

Hell, he'd have no way of showing

11

that it was picked later.

12

is --

13

QUESTION;

But more importantly, there

But at the time he made the

14

inventory, he inventoried it as a locked briefcase.

15

if it was picked it would have to be picked later.

16

MR. HARIED:

So

But he could still be unjustly

17

accused of being the person who picked it, and he'd have

18

no way of protecting against that.

19

But there’s still in that situation the

20

important governmental interest in not bringing into the

21

policy station containers that may hold valuable -- I'm

22

sorry -- that may hold particularly dangerous items, and

23

have to store them there, because then the police would

24

have no way of knowing what

25

it is they're storing.

If we get into an analysis that draws — tries

(202) 628-9300

to draw a line between locked and unlocked containers,

2

we really are getting into a worthy versus unworthy

3

container analysis.

4

this type of search to have a bright line that the

5

police officers can follow in each case, so that they

6

don't have to make that kind of a judgment and they're

7

not subject to later accusation or being second guessed

8

about that.

there’s a greater governmental interest in opening

to open closed containers.

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER - Resumed

8

MR. HARIED;

Thank you.

9

Before lunch I was saying that the defendant’s

10

argument about the security of the jailhcuse could -- I

11

was saying that that interest in a secure jailhouse

12

could adequately be served simply by taking closed

13

containers from an arrested person and sealing them and

14

putting them in a safe place outside of the jail.

15

However, in Illinois versus Lafayette this

16

Court refused to impose such a less intrusive means

17

requirement on jail personnel.

18

to impose such a requirement in this case.

19

And there is no reason

It’s significant to note also, as was raised

20

in Justice Scalia’s question, the fact that when

21

containers are found in impounded and inventoried

22

automobiles that if they’re going to be kept for

23

safekeeping they have to be taken to the police

24

department, and as a result there is a situation that is

25

substantially the same as that in Illinois versus

Lafayette.
In

both the booking inventory context and the

3

automobile inventory context, closed containers are

4

coming into the jail.

5

as important, it's imperative that the police know what

6

it is that they are taking custody of so that they can

7

take proper measures to safely store it.

8
9

P.nd in both situations, it's just

The Respondent has also argued that closed
container inventory searches during inventories of

10

automobiles will lead to a parade of horrible results.

11

This is not true because there is already criteria in

12

the case law that would limit the application of the

13

inventory exception to particular facts and situations.

14

And lower courts have been in the past and

15

will continue to be fully able to apply those criteria

16

to separate the lawful inventory search from the

17

unlawful pretext search.

whether to leave it in the car or not or to move it into

the police station.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HARIED;

Well, why did they open it?
They opened it because the police

22

officer didn't know if there was anything particularly

23

valuable that needed safekeeping or anything

24

particularly dangerous that also needed safekeeping,

25

because from the outside of the pack there was no way of

The danger would have been, if by

That's right.
But he wouldn't want to leave it in

the truck if it contained a loaded pistol , would he?

10

MR. HARIED:

That's correct.
Because somebody might come along

12

and get it and obtain a loaded pistol, someone who

shouldn't have a loaded pistol.

MR. HARIED:

Absolutely.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

3

MR. LAZARUS;

4

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
It is our position that this case is

6
7

controlled by this Court's decisions in Lafayette and

8

Opperman.

9

backpack violates the Fourth

Respondent's claim that the search of his
Amendment rests at bottom

10

on the proposition that a routine inventory search

11

cannot validly extend to the contents of containers

12

located inside a lawfully impounded motor vehicle.
According to Respondent, the scope of such an

13
14

inventory search is per se unreasonable even if

15

performed pursuant to standard police department

16

procedures, as the district court found was the case

17

here, and not a mere pretext for an investigatory

18

motive, as the district court found was not the case

19

here.

20

We believe that Respondent’s proposed

21

limitation on the scope of valid, routine, inventory

22

searches is not supported by the Fourth Amendment.

23

Indeed , we believe that Respondent's view has in

24

principle, if not in fact, already been squarely

25

rejected by this court in Lafayette and in Cpperman.

virtually alone in upholding the limitation on routine

inventory searches urged by

Most importantly,

Respondent here.
as Petitioner has already

6

emphasized, justifications for the administrative

7

practice of inventory searches apply with full force to

8

the inventorying of containers taken into police

9

custody, including those located in motor vehicles.

10

Such searches may on a categorical basis be needed;

11

first, to protect the owner’s property; second, to

12

protect the police from false claims of theft; and third

13

and finally, to protect the police and their employees

14

from the dangers associated

In

13

legitimate needs of the inventory search .justified the

14

routine inventory search of a motor vehicle in police

15

16

same needs justified the routine inventory search of a

17

house.

In

Me see no reason to suppose that these same

19

needs don't justify an inventory search of basically the

21

equivalent of the Lafayette shoulder bag in the Opperman

only when the container is itself physically located at

2

the station house.
The facts of this case we believe illustrate

3
4

both principles.

In this case the police were in lawful

custody of Respondent's motor vehicle and its contents

in the field, and had to determine there what to do with

function.

They faced a

purely administrative

It was plainly reasonable, we believe, for the

9

10

police in deciding what property in the car to take for

11

safekeeping in the property room in the station house to

12

inventory the contents of containers they found, as long

13

as the search was performed, as it was here, in a manner

14

that was reasonably confined and subject in scope to

15

those limited ends.
The contrary view, which is what Respondents

16
17

propose here, we believe, would inevitably lead to

18

undesirable judicial management of routine

19

administrative procedures and, even more fundamentally,

20

it would likely lead to procedural rules that would be

21

incompatible with efficient and prompt police

22

administration of their caretakinc, non-investigative

23

function .

24
25

For example, Respondents propose that the
validity of a routine inventory search should turn on a

(202) 628-9300

case by case inquiry into the availability of less

2

intrusive means.

3

fundamentally incompatible with the notion of a routine

4

administrative procedure.

5

Such a requirement would be

Inquiry into the needs of the police in a

6

particular case, such as that undertaken by the Colorado

7

Supreme Court here, into the subject of suspicions about

8

the contents of specific containers, the availability of

9

certain towing companies, the relative records of

10

various towing companies, the privacy expectations that

11

owners might have with respect to an infinite variety of

12

containers, would inevitably convert a routine

13

administrative procedure into an ad hoc process.

14

Both the purposes of the inventory search and,

15

ironically, the rationale of this Court's acceptance of

16

such searches would both he defeated.

17

Respondent also proposes that consent should

18

be a prerequisite to a valid inventory search.

19

course, requiring consent would be tantamount to saying

20

that inventory searches are not entitled to any special

21

Fourth Amendment analysis, because consent is already an

22

exception to the Fourth Amendment probably cause and

23

warrant requirements.

24
25

Of

In any event, as this Court has recognized
already in Opperman, consent does not recognize or

address the legitimate needs of the police to protect

2

themselves.
No doubt for these reasons, both in Opperman

3
4

and in Lafayette this Court has already squarely

5

rejected the constitutional requirement of consent.

6

our view, the sole inquiry in each case should be

7

threef old:
First, whether the property is lawfully in

8
9

police custody for non-investig ative reasons;
Second, whether there exist routine inventory

10
11

procedures that are reasonable in scope and subject;
And finally, whether the police have followed

those routine procedures in the case at hand.
In this case, all

14

three inquiries support the

15

reasonableness of the search and were supported by

16

findings of the district court.

17

that the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court should

18

be reversed.

Accordingly, we believe

whether the Colorado Supreme Court got into the

to remand for them to consider that issue?

Is that what

Well, I would suggest that this

muddled by the way that the case came to this Court.

MR. LACKLEN:

3

That's correct.

So I don't see why granting

certiorari on that issue was improvident.

5

assume we disagree with you on the outcome of that

6

issue.

let's

What do you suggest the disposition should be?
MR. LACKLEN;

7

Now,

Well, the case clearly has to be

8

remanded to the state court, because the state court

9

didn't rule on the state constitutional grounds on which

10

the evidence

was originally suppressed.

If the DA were

11

to go back to trial today, after a reversal of the

12

Colorado Supreme Court, he still wouldn't have any

13

evidence, because the trial court suppressed the

14

evidence on state constitutional grounds.
And we would disagree with the district

15
16

attorney on the clearness of the Colorado state ruling.

17

It would be our submission that the Colorado court,

18

although citing the Fourth Amendment, said that the

19

Colorado constitution may exclude this evidence also.

20

And so it's not clear that the prosecution wins even if

21

this Court issues what may be an advisory opinion on

22

this issue to the Colorado Supreme Court.
