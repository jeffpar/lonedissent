ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FiSFISt

Mr. Chief Justice* and nay It

10

please the Court* this case involves issues slnilar to

that present In the prior discussion* and started by the

filing of three complaints in the Western Oistrict of

Pennsylvania by plaintiff Or. AI-KhazraJI charging

various offenses under the civil rights laws of the

United States.

21

operative complaint as viewed by the District Court did

22

not charge any racial discrimination but charged

23

discrimination on the basis of national origin and

24

religion* and that therefore the question then becomes

25

whether or not an Arab under the facts here would be

origin and a religion complaint» not a racial one.

But the fact remains that the operative

on the notion that in fact a racial complaint at least

9

he gave that he qualifies as a Caucasian* l.e.* that he
in fact racially white.

The statute basically talks In

In the deposition that

10

is

11

discrimination are presumably that he was discriminated

12

against In relation to other people who are racially

13

white* and our position very simply Is that

14

of a factual situation a claim under Section IS81 Is not

15

made.

16

admitted

17

Caucasian*

18

statute has been construed by this Court to apply on a

19

racial basis* not on a national origin basis* not on a

20

religion basis* not on a sex basis* and therefore once

21

the plaintiff

22

and when his purported complaint Is that he was

23

discriminated against In dental of tenure In relation to

24

other Caucasians* that a claim is not made under the

25

statute.

And

The charges of

it really comes down to that.

In that kind

He has

Namely* that he was discriminated

on the grounds of race because that was the intent of

the people who tired hia.
MR. FISFISS

There Is absolutely no evidence

in the record to ay knowledge* Your Honor* that there is

any racial animus at all In terms of the decision that

was made.

Or that the decision was made

because they thought that he was of different race.
MR. FISFISS

That is correct* Your Honor.

My

15

recollection of the record is that there is absolutely

16

no evidence In the record at all to Indicate that.

17

I will say in all fairness that there was very limited

18

discovery In the matter.

19

QUESTIONS

Now*

So his argument* you say* is that

20

he claims to have been discriminated on the grounds of

21

race but concedes he is not of a different race?

MR. FISFISS

That is correct.

That is

7

HR* FISFISS

Your Honor» I would submit that

8

that Is Irrelevant* that the critical thing Is that the

9

statute is in terms of white citizens* and the contrast

10

therefore to have a discrimination claim under 1981 has

11

to be in reference to white* which Is a racial

12

characterization* and that you cannot contrast that and

13

treat Germans or English or Greeks or Italians as being

14

people within the scope of the statute*

QUESTIONS

Even though they thought they were

16

doing something about race in the sense that they

17

understood race at that time*

18

HR* FISFISS

If the Court please* 1 do not

19

think that the legislative history Is anywhere near

20

22

through the debates on the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

If

they are described as race* It so often comes up In the

question of they are really talking about the

legislatures having power to dIscrlalnate by saying the

Germans» for example» are not allowed to own property

and things of that sort*

6

earlier discussions that the Court had as to whether the

7

statute In fact covers private claims of action» and the

8

decisions of the Court have determined» of course» that

In some ways we go back to the

it does» so we have to operate on that premise.
And you also run Into the generalized

10
11

disagreement that the Court has had over the years

12

whether the Civil Rights Act of 1666 and the reenactment

13

In 1870 were In fact designed to deal solely with the

14

freed slaves and the people In the south rather than the

15

broadened scope that has since been given so that It now

16

apparently covers discrimination against whites» at

17

least vis-a-vis people of other races.
But those decisions have been reached.

18

Unless

1

the Court Is prepared to find exceptions to those or

20

overrule those earlier tines of cases» we have to face

21

the fact that this Court has already decided that the

22

scope of the statute goes beyond the mere protection of

23

blacks which was one of the earlier positions that was

24

taken.

word "race" to be relevant to the meaning of "white

13

MS. MITCHELL;

Your Honor* we look at the term

14

"race" because one of the things that was happening

15

about the time that the 1866 Act was passed was that In

16

the 1830s there was an influx of Irish and German.

17

These waves of Immigrants created some severe problems

18

for persons In states such as Ohio who believed as

19

advocates of the American nativlst movement that the

20

Irish and the Germans were not fit to live with those of

21

the Anglo-Saxon race.

22

A prominent Know-Nothing tract published in

23

1854 Indicated that Irish and Germans were not of the

24

type of quality of persons that we would want dwelling

25

with those of the Anglo-Saxon race* and openly advocated
