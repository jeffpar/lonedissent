and may

I would

17

briefly what our position

18

laid out well*

19

Kentucky* but in essence what

20

Batson was a clear break with the past.

Is

Justice*

like to summarize

In this case.

It has been

I think* by the attorney general
it

is

from

is simply this*

that

That the Johnson case* while holding that

21

22

ordinarily case

new decisions will

be given retroactive

23

effect on direct appeal* made an exception

24

that

25

Allen against Hardy this Court found that the Stovall

for

cases

it referred to as clear break cases* and that

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

in

1

against Denno tactors cut against full retroactivity for

2

Batson*

3

We put those three propositions together and

4

we submit that that compels a finding that Batson should

5

not be held retroactive on direct appeal in this case*

6

Now» Justice Biackmun asked a question» I

7

believe» in the first argument about whether this clear

8

break exception to the Johnson rule should be preserved»

9

whether it has any justification» and that ties in» I

10

think» with the question of what the status of Stovall

11

is with respect to direct appeal cases at this point*

12

As we read the Court's opinion in Johnson»

13

what the Court was saying was» yes» we are adopting to

14

an extent Justice Harlan's rule that the new decisions

15

would be applied retroactively on direct appeal* but we

16

are not willing to go so far as to overturn settled

17

precedent in this area» particularly with respect to

18

that area of settled precedent in which the Stovall

19

against Denno factors are the most compelling» and that

20

is the definition of the clear break area*

21

Now» in the clear break area» as this Court

22

recognized in Johnson» that Is the very area where the

23

Stovall against Denno factors operate very strongly»

24

particularly the factors of reliance by prosecutors*

25

trial courts» and courts of appeals» and the

in that area» that

QUESTIONS

Welly I

gather» Mr* Bryson» you

2

don't think that what

3

controls this case without more?

4

I read earlier from

MR. BRYSONS

Well»

I think

in

Stovall

light of

5

Johnson» Your Honor» we would say that

6

this case to the extent that the Court concludes that

7

this

8

Court concludes

9

Stovall under the analysis of

is a clear

break case.
that

It does control

Now» of course»

if

the

it is not a clear break case»

then

Johnson doesn't have any

10

applicability» and the Court would then go to the Harlan

11

rule which would be simply flat-out applicable —

12

retroactivity as applied to direct review.
So the answer

13

is yes» but

It

Is yes because we

14

believe

15

condition precedent for Stovall

16

Johnson.

17

clear break case» and there Is a

18

briefs» and there has been argument this morning about

19

whether

this

Is a clear break case» and that
applying as

we read

Now» that brings me to the question»

it

is this a

lot of argument

In the

Is.
We would rely» of course»

20

Is a

very heavily on both

21

Johnson»

in which a clear break was defined as either a

22

straight overruling or the Court disapproving a well

23
