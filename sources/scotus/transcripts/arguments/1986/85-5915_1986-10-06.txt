state law has something to say.

1983 is perhaps the

matter kind of awkward to have two different tests for

such closely related things, isn’t it?
MR. WOODWARD:
awkwardness.

Well, there is some

Cn the other hand, unless seme specific

method is found of addressing the particular nature of
Section 1933, then the demands of that statute and the
intent of Congress expressed in that statute are just
not likely to be recognized.
Now, we concede that there is seme similarity
in sort of the middle and the core tests cf the implied
rights inquiry, that is the inquiry into Congressional
intent, and the Section 1983 inquiry about preclusion.
But there is a difference of where they’re coming from
as well.
The implied rights inquiry is really
traditionally applied in the context of a plaintiff
trying to meet.a burden of establishing Congressional
intent, from

whatever evidence is available.

In the

1533 context, the Congressional intent that you start
with is the expressed intent, express intent in 1983
itself.
QUESTION:

Where there is a state involved.

MR. WOODWARD:

Where a state or a state actor

is involved, yes.
QUESTION:

This is the class of cases that

1983 applies to?
5

(202) 628-9300

MR. WOODWARDS

1

That is correct.

It is

2

defendant-specific, in that sense, and it is only in

3

that context that this area of examination of

4

Congressional intent would be different from the implied

5

rights inquiry.
The nature of Section

6

1983 is such that the

7

sort of evidence that will suffice to justify preclusion

8

has to be substantially greater than that which would

9

defeat a plaintiff, attempting to establish an implied

10

right of action.

And the reason for that is that there

11

is, after all, in 1983 that express intent that private

12

parties have that remedy against that certain class of

13

d efendants.
And so it should net be, that express grant of

14
15

authority to proceed, should not be really impeachable,

16

except by equally strong evidence.
QUESTION:

17
18

It’s only if there is some

identifiable federal legal right involved?
MR. WOODWARD:

19

That is correct, Your Honor.

20

We would concede that you have to identify a right

21

secured by the Constitution and laws, as Section 1993

22

requir es.

23

But I think that the chief problem in this

24

case was not the identification of a right.

25

Circuit may have been a little reluctant about it and

QUESTION:

4

Pardon?

You don't think you have to rely on

the regulations?
MR. WOODWARD:

We don't have any reservations

5

about reading that together with the statute, but we

6

think that there is adequate strength in the statute

7

itself if we had to do that.

8

we have to separate the regulation and the statute,

9

because they are closely tied.

10

This is not a case where

But I'm trying to point out that there is in

11

1437(a) a definition of low income housing that includes

12

not only the dwelling, but also embracing the necessary

13

appurtenances thereto.

14

Congress passed the Brooke amendment HUD's regulations

15

interpreted specifically or prescribed specifically what

16

tenants were supposed to get for their rent.

17

Mow, both before and after

And in those regulations, HUD said not only

18

the dwelling, but also the equipment that's included in

19

the dwelling, necessary services, and reasonable amounts

20

of utilities.

21

the Brooke amendment was adopted, and that was the

22

standard that the Housing Authority and the tenants and

23

HUD and everybody agreed on.

24
25

That was the standard before and after

So that when the Brooke amendment was adopted,

Now, it was only in 1930 that HUD went beyond

20

The regulation provided both procedural steps

21

a substantive standard, the intent being that not mere

The Fourth Circuit# focusing chiefly on the
1983 question, found that Congress had intended to
preclude such private actions for enforcement,
notwithstanding the specificity with which the Brooke
amendment identifies the tenants as the beneficiaries,
in fact the sole beneficiaries, of the rent limit in
that s ta tute .
And the way in which the question
approached I

was

think suggests the weakness cf trying tc

apply uniformly a Cort versus Ash sort of inquiry,
because it led to what is definitely a wrong
conclusion.
Despite the fact that in this context there is
no Congressional express preclusion of private suits -there is nothing in the statute, there is nothing in the
legislative history that says private parties may not
sue — and despite the absence of any express private
remedy effective in these circumstances, such as was
present in the Middlesex County Sewerage Authority
versus Rational Sea Clammers case, the Fourth Circuit
reached cut tc find from the very, very modest evidence
of the granting of administrative authority to HUD ever
this program that that represented Congressional intent
tc preclude a Section

1983 remedy.

Now, when you examine that evidence you have

section of the United States Housing Act

which specifies

what is to be enforced through the annual contributions

13

The Brooke amendment occurs in a different portion of

14

the Act, suggesting that that's not one of the explicit

15

things to which the contributions contract must be

addressed.
It is also the case that HUD itself apparently

21

only for the extent of our clients* --

QUESTION;

Well, I know.

But if HUD has that

3

MR. WOODWARD;

direction. Your Honor.

5

very limited

6

That certainly points in that
It would require more than the

authority shown here, certainly.

The implications of the way the Fourth Circuit

7

has treated this, of course, are substantial.

8

this very modest grant of administrative authority,

9

whether you read it as the statute says or the way HUD

If with

10

reads it — either way, it’s a fairly modest grant cf

11

administrative authority and what we believe is a very

12

clearly vested sort of right in the individual.
If that combination in this case presents

13
14

preclusion problems, then there will be preclusion

15

problems or perhaps an insurmountable preclusion barrier

16

in virtually any case in which an individual tries to

17

vindicate their individual rights in a grant program,

18

without regard to how specifically, how concretely, or

19

how strongly Congress in the program statute vested the

20

individual rights.
QUESTION;

21

Of course, one of the questions

22

here is whether there is a vested individual right,

23

isn't it?

24
25

MR. WOODWARD:
Your Honor.

That is a legitimate question,

We think it is not hard to find the
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

individual right that the Pennhurst inquiry calls fcr

2

here, because of the specificity of the Brooke amendment

3

itself, which both in its legislative history and in its

4

original wording talks about the family’s income, the

5

fact that nobody else benefits from that limit -- while

6

it may operate as a standard for what HUD pays, it’s

7

only the tenants that benefit from that limit — and

8

from the fact that the regulations that tie into the

9

statute are themselves phrased in terms of the shalls

10

and the mandatory elements of a right and focus very

11

specifically, again, on what the tenant is to get fcr

12

his rent.
QUESTION;

13

It’s phrased in terms of what HUD

14

will contribute to the local housing authority, not in

15

terms of just an across the regulation, across the board

16

regulation, isn’t it?

17

MR. WOODWARD;

Now, I believe that ultimately

18

it is tied into that, but my recollection of the

19

regulation is that it does give absolute sort of

20

legislative commands to the Housing Authority about hew

21

it must perform its duties.

22

And again, we’re net talking here about an

23

ambiguous performance of a duty or a discretionary

24

performance.

25

all.

We’re talking about no performance at

This in that sense is the classic core application

of 1983, where federal statutory provisions for the

2

benefit of an individual have been absolutely defied.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Woodward, excuse me for

4

interrupting you, but I'd like to ask whether, is your

5

position that any individual tenant could bring a

6

Section 1983 action about any complaint he had?

7

say the tenant felt the heat was inadequate or the

8

maintenance was inadequate or the air conditioning

9

wasn't working.

10

MR. WOODWARD i

QUESTION:

Yes, but I want to know where the

limits of your argument lead us.
MR. WOODWARD:

15
16

That would be a very broad

assumption, Justice Powell.

13
14

Could the individual go to federal

court and bring a suit in 1983?

11
12

Let's

I don't think we need to go

that far.

17

QUESTION:

I understand that.

18

MR. WOODWARD:

And the reason is this.

I

19

think we're tied in this case to the very specific grant

20

of substantive right which the Brooke amendment

21

represents.

22

that other previsions of the Housing Authority — I

23

mean, I'm sorry, of

24

and don't grant a substantive right.

25

Now, the Fourth Circuit at least has held

the Housing Act -- don't go so far

Without conceding

that those decisions are

It will not follow from a

It still must be specifically tied into some

7

provision of the Housing Act which grants a substantive

right.

9

Another important point about that —

10

QUESTION*

You mean these tenants have a right

11

to get the utilities paid for, but they don't

12

necessarily have a right to have the utilities working?
MR. WOODWARD:

13

Well, I'm not going to assume

14

that they might not, Your Honor.

15

saying is only that, as far as the regulation goes, it

16

doesn't — that we’re relying upon, it doesn't address

17

that .

18

QUESTION;

I think that what I'm

That's not a very appealing

argument in the next case.

MR. WOODWARD;

it is tied to a right, then in fact we may have an

But I think it's important to note that we

5

have had that perhaps all alcng.

Since the Brooke

6

amendment was passed in 1969, it has widely been assumed

7

that tenants may sue under the Brooke amendment to

8

enforce the rental limitation in that amendment.

It has

that tenants could sue.

In fact, as the cases cited in cur brief show,

13
14

they have sued.

They have not sued in such overwhelming

15

numbers as to flood the courts, but the assumption that

16

they had suit available has been operative, and they

17

have used those suits.
QUESTION:

18

You say "sue,"

Now, of course your

19

claim could be asserted in state court, if I understand

20

you, could it not?
MR. WOODWARD:

21

Well, it is my understanding

22

state courts have an obligation tc entertain any federal

23

claim.

24

courts also must entertain the claim.

25

The real question here is whether the federal

5

narrow attempt of Petitioners to achieve utilities in

6

the form of electricity.

7

Please allow me to be more specific.

8

966 had a precursor at 24 CFR 366 and had a precursor at

9

the HUD handbook.

24 CFB

In each and every one of those

10

instances, HUE has uniformly held that housing

11

authorities, in order to be able to orerate under the

12

scheme envisioned by Congress in 1937, a scheme

13

envisioning a lease and a relationship of

14

landlord-tenant sorts of things, that under those

15

provisions the PHA could charge maintenance for

16

everything over ordinary wear and tear.

17

That is by regulation.

Moreover, they may

18

charge late charges, they may charge for security

19

deposits, they may also, incidentally -- and this is

20

true prior to the Brooke amendment -- charge for excess

21

utilities, particularly where those utilities are

22

incurred through the use of major tenant-supplied

23

appliances.

24
25

Congress has embodied those regulations in the
very same statute upon which Petitioners rely in this

2

now as the Brooke amendment, found at Section 1D37a{a)

3

of the Act, previously found at Section 1402, and

4

embodied in the Housing Act in one form or another as a

5

definition of low rent housing, which I might transfer

6

into a definition of what you get for your dollar, ever

7

since 1937.
In

8
9

Petitioners rely under what is commonly known

1S83 the Congress, realizing that HUD was

about to repeal its regulations pertaining to the

10

maintenance of the lease action, amended the Act at

11

14371.

12

happens to coincide with "lease.”

13

And interestingly and curiously enough, "l"

14371 of the Act says that every PHA lease

14

shall have a reasonable term, shall provide for decent,

15

safe, and sanitary housing, shall provide for a time fcr

16

eviction and

17

HUD had before regulated.

18

notice of cause for eviction, things which

Now Congress, recognizing that they were an

19

essential part of that program enacted in 1937 and

20

amended in 1947,

21

course then of the eighties in

22

linched its entire scheme of landlord-ten ant proceedings

23

on a lease, a lease which they had now, realizing that

24

HUD might back away from the regulations, Congress

25

enacted an amendment which said, no, you may not do it.

And so if it can be said that the Brooke

2

amendment limit to rent under 1437a(a) and the

3

regulations under 24 CFR 865, now 965, if these give

4

rise to a right or to a remedy, then so dees every term

because I at

one time had decided, as I had argued and

reeved in this case originally, that it ought be
dismissed since HUD was an indispensable party and had
not been joined.

making that motion, the decision of this Court in
Heckler was rendered and there became some serious
question as to the wisdom of my motion at that moment.

I would think that that would be up to HUD, realizing

that they had a derelict PHA on their hands, to exercise

Section 1404 of the Act, which explicitly gives HUD the

right to sue and, interestingly enough, also gives the

right to sue HUD.

If I might share it briefly with this

The HUD regulations at 24 CFR 865 et seg., and

But the ones at issue in this instance are a consumption

set of regs.

of what these regs may mean in terms of whether or not

all of these very nice steps on the -- in fact, the

interrogatory answers say, as I’m sure the Court is

aware, that we deemed our compliance in compliance with

the regs.

• But nevertheless -QUESTION; Part of your argument, as I

understand your brief, is that the state has never

understood its obligation under the contract or under

19

the law or under the regulations to make it liable to

20

cover utilities.

21

MR. HARRIS;

We provide utilities, free

utilities in a reasonable amount, to the tenants of the

MR. HARRIS:

That is correct, sir, although I

pointed out, that I somehow have said that there might

11

finding things like wasteful, individual circumstance,

higher use by reason of tenant-supplied appliances, when

13

you get into the new regs which speak of luxuries versus

14

necessities, when indeed as you get to the conflicting

15

allocation, which I was about to mention.

16

The regs also provide that in fiscal year 1981

17

and 1982, if the PHA does not effectuate a five percent

18

-- a reduction, excuse me -- a reduction in energy use,

19

then it will be penalized five percent of its operating

subsidy in the subsequent year.

QUESTION;

Well, do you draw the line

for and what is left to these considerations you’re just

mentioning, what’s in the lease the tenants can sue the

PHA for if it’s not furnished, but the section you just

mentioned is left to some sort of other kind cf

Kr. Harris, as to what the tenants can sue

HR. HARRIS:

18

Yes,

sir.

It is -- the

19

regulatory -- the part cf the regulations that a tenant

20

may sue for is that part which is embodied in the lease,

21

which ironically is regulated in itself in all of its

22

detail.

23

And yet, there are myriad other regulations

pertaining to housing that do not have any relationship

perforce with the tenant, but have an indirect impact in

of the languaqe in some of the opinions which has

and attempting to get money from HUD.

14

15

level.

And that bothers

I think that, most importantly, one of the

17

things that we have said throughout is that the idea of

jurisdictional kinds of claims of this sort or remedies

19

of this sort is something that I have referred to before

20

and would leave with this Court for its consideration as

21

what I call screen door jurisdiction.

QUESTION!

How much of a burden is it?

I

mean, is there hundreds of these cases every year?
MR. HASRISi

I don't know hew many.

I dc knew

that most of these cases are handled under the tenant
grievance mechanism, which is also mandated by HUD and
is provided for as a part of the lease, under section 13
of the lease in this particular instance and as a part
of the prototype lease required by 1437k cf the Act.
QUESTION!

Are you suggesting that if a

federal remedy were available, the tenants would no
longer use this grievance procedure that the regulations
provide for?
MR. HARRIS!

No, sir.

I do not believe a

federal remedy is available, but I do believe they would
use the grievance mechanism.

I believe that if a

federal remedy were available, that that's where they
would go, because it does have class action impact and
because every screen door and every broken light bulb is
a part of what someone has once referred to me as the
typical seething undercurrent of discontent that you
might find among tenants generally.
And T do not mean

of mine, who said don't make a federal case cut of it,

And I think that that's outside of the ambit

unique situation 51 years ago with a lease arrangement
with a landlord-tenant relationship, recognizing that
they were dealing in leaseholds.
The principle that we suggest with regard to
the cases is really quite simple.

What happens in fact is that the grievance

18

It's not a marvelous thing,

but if the problem of the

tenant is with the question

cf whe kicked in the screen

21

is a way to address that.

22

What the grievance mechanism is specifically

So in fact,' some matters are specifically

What makes this case particularly a federal case is that

program.
It just isn't right for a state court to be
