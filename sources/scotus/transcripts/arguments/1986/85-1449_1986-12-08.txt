CHIEF JUSTICE REHN QUIST :

whenever you are ready, Mr.
MR. GARDNER:

Mr.

You may proceed

Gardner.
Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On

7

fcehalf of the town of Newton, New

8

Hampshire, I appear before you today because a gentleman

9

by the name of Bernard Rumery reached an agreement in

10

conjunction with the dismissal of a valid criminal

11

prosecution against him.

12

would not pursues a civil action against the town, the

13

arresting officer, or any of the town's public, servants.

Mr. Rumery agreed that he

Subsequently, Mr.

14

Rumery breached that-

15

agreement.

The Federal District Court, Justice wartin

16

Laughlin, ruled that Mr. Fumery's agreement should be

17

e nf ore ed .
The Court specifically found that Mr. Rumery

18
19

voluntarily, knowingly and deliberately waived his right

20

to bring a subsequent action and that when he did so, he

21

did so thinking and knowing

22

1

If the Court accepts the arguments offered by

2

Mr. Rumery and allows him to revoke his agreement, then

3

this Court not only will be providing Mr. Rumery with a

4

benefit but will also be denying all present and future

5

defendants in a situation like Mr. Rumery, they will in

6

effect be prevented from taking upon themselves an

7

opportunity like that which was presented by Mr. Rumery.

11

I therefore suggest to the Court that
application of a per se rule in this case offends ccmmcn
sense, basic justice, and fair play.
QUESTION:

The argument that you are

12

preventing future people from engaging in it is not

13

terribly persuasive.

15

blackmailers

the opportunity to prevent blackmailers from doing the

17

terrible things they are threatening to dc by making a

promise to them.

You could say the same thing

I would agree, Your Honor, the

So if,

indeed, there is some

22

overreaching

here, and it is a bad thing to have cities

23

or anybody doing this sort of thing -- it's hardly

24

something to be worried about, that we’re preventing it

25

from happening in the future.

MR. GARDNERS

If in fact it were overreaching,

2

I would agree, Your Honor.

3

blackmailer in the town might be engaging in a similar

4

type of conduct as regards this type of a situation, I

5

would suggest, is not appropriate.

6

The suggestion that a

This is a case where the County Attorney, as

7

opposed to a town -- an actual town representative --

8

entered in to an agreement when he was concerned about a

9

prosecution, concerned about the principal witness, the

10

complaining witness, and the fact that she was also the

11

victim of a rape and that she may not be willing to

12

testify in this subsequent action, he entered into an

13

agreement at

that point in time to dismiss the

14

prosecution,

conditioned upon the police officer, the

15

public servants, and the town being somewhat protected,

16

or being protected against a civil action.

17

This is a case where a man made a voluntary,

18

knowing and deliberate choice.

This is a case where a

19

man gave up a right to a civil remedy, and it’s a case

20

that I would suggest, also --

21

QUESTION:

He also gave up the right to defend

22

himself in court, too, I suppose.

23

is on the table is whether he wanted to stand trial cn a

24

criminal charge.

25

MR. GARDNER:

The thing that really

He had a choice.

He chose net

tc stand trial on a criminal charge, but in a sense

2

chose to have his day in court when he had nothing tc

3

lose, apparently, be reneging on his agreement and

4

thereafter --

QUESTION;

Do you think there are very many

6

cases in which the defendand would say, I'd much rather

7

go to trial on the criminal

dismiss the charges?

MS. GARDNER;

charge, than just have you

Commonly, I would expect that a

10

defendant who is assured of his innocence will dc that.

11

I expect in a plea bargain situation --

12

QUESTION;

Assured of his innocence, he'd

13

still want to go to trial, even though you know nothing

14

is all that certain in trials’

15

MR. GARDNER;

Well, I would expect, Justice

16

Stevens, that that's very similar to the plea bargaining

17

situation and we see people who stand trial despite plea

18

bargain offers on a daily basis.

19

I would suggest in that situation --

20

QUESTION;

Those are a choice between one of

21

two different criminal trials.

hever one where you get total exoneration in exchange

24
25

MR. GARDNER;

The plea bargain is

Well, there are plea bargains

which are very near total exoneration, situations in New

Hampshire, for instance, where an individual can plead

2

to a lesser included misdemeanor and suffer a

3

conditional discharge which allows him an automatic

4

annulment of his record in one year.

If in this particular case —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GARDNER:

It’s still fairly serious.'
It is certainly net going tc

8

jail, for instance, and it's something that if it were

9

done in this case, we would not be here today over it.
I’m not suggesting particularly that Mr.

10
11

Rum^ry would or would not have entered into an agreement

12

like that.

13

between that and what happened in this case is not all

14

that great and that in effect all that’s happened here

15

is, the state has given up a criminal prosecution but in

16

doing sc, in

17

propriety of the arrest, not a question of abuse of

18

force, a question of arrest, and in this case all tht

19

was at issue was whether the arrest was proper.

20

But I am suggesting that the distinction

a case involving arrest, a question cf the

QUESTION:

Do you suppose a bargain would be

21

enforceable if the prosecutor said, we’ll dismiss the

22

charges if you give $1,000 to the police benefit fund?

Well, why is that any different

front this?
MR. GARDNER:

3

Well, because in that case the

4

prosecutor is doing something that’s wholly outside his

5

ambit.

QUESTION:

You mean he has a duty to prosecute

if he thinks there's prima facie evidence?
MR. GARDNER:

He has a duty to prosecute, but

his duty is net solely to convict.

His duty is to serve

10

society and the best interests of society, and there are

11

many cases that --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Don't you think the police benefit

fund serves society?
MR. GARDNER:

Not as directly as the

15

prosecutor's activities on behalf of society in judging

16

whether or not in a particular case --

17

QUESTION:

Well, here you can settle a loss to

18

it for less than $1,000, if

19

What's the difference?

20

MR. GARDNER:

it's a frivolous case.

I don't understand.
Well, the distinction, I would

21

suggest, Your Honor, is that again the prosecutor in the

22

situation where he garnered

23

benefit society would in fact be outside the ambit of

24

proper prosecutorial discretion, whereas in this

25

situation, I

-- garnered the release for two or

3

three police officers who otherwise might be subjected

to personal liability.

5

MR. GARDNER:

The prosecutor in this case.

6

Your Honor, did not — there is no evidence, that the

7

prosecutor in this case demanded a release.

S

evidence is in this case that the defending attorney,

Attorney Woods, called the prosecuting attorney and

said, you'd better dismiss the case against my client

11

and if you don't, we're going to sue afterwards and

12

we're going to win.
He then knew, having thrown down the gauntlet,

13
14

as he testified to in his deposition, that the only way

15

this case could be resolved is if a release were

executed.

QUESTION:

In other words, it was settled cn

19

the assumption that there was a meritorious 1983 claim

20

that would otherwise be filed, is that it?

21

MR. GARDNERi

It was not -- I would not

22

suggest that it was settled cn the assumption that there

23

was a meritorious claim.

24

settled on the assumption that any claim brought, a 1983

25

claim or other, a false arrest state claim, has a

sued a considerable inconvenience.

It causes the person against whom suit is
brought to have to defend that action.
QUESTION;

The cost

--

Why is that inconvenience to the

6

individual police officer any different from the benefit

7

to my police fund ?

8
9

MR. GARDNER;

Because the police officer in

the criminal justice system is a public servant.

The

10

prosecutor is acting on behalf of the state.

11

officer, when he arrested Mr. Rumery, vas net making --

12

he vas not taking action on his own behalf.

13

acting for the state.

14

The police

He vac

He was, in effect, an agent of the state.

15

a matter of fact, in bringing the 1983 action, the

16

plaintiff must so plead, that he was a state actor.

17

QUESTION;

Mr.

Gardner, if the

As

1983 suit has a

18

dollar settlement value, how is the case different from

19

just having the police say,

20

the city $1,000 it will dismiss the charges?

21

MR. GARDNER;

if the respondent will pay

I would suggest, Your Honor,

22

that not all cases have a dollar settlement value on

23

account of their inherent value.

QUESTION;

You said this one prcbably did.

MR. GARDNER;

I was suggesting that I have a

QUESTION’;

Well, let's suppose there is a

dollar settlement value.

6

saying, you pay us "X” number of dollars and we'll drop

7

the charges?
MR. GARDNER;

8
9

How is it different from just

Well, a dollar settlement value,

as I understand it, if this were a case that were being

10

pursued, would run to Mr. Rumery rather than vice

versa.

I think your example suggests that Kr. Rumery is

14

something of value.

Well, he is giving up his suit,

MR. GARDNER;

1

because here the city has something else it*s concerned

2

about other than just the operation of the process of

3

the enforcement of the criminal law in reaching this

4

agreement?

5

the city's or the officer’s own liability.

6

There's another element at stake, to wit,

MR. GARDNER:

In the plea bargaining context,

7

he's obviously pleading to a reduced offense, even to

8

the point of a reduced offense that is perhaps not going

9

to cause him any disability for any great period of time

10
11
12
13

into the future.
QUESTION:

And what was the motive of the

prosecutor, or the reason -MR. GARDNER:

In our case there were several

motives, I think.

discretion to look at the situation, and

16

to the Court that you have tc look at the totality cf

17

the circumstances and determine whether it was

18

voluntary, just, deliberate.

19

QUESTION:

I think it's appopriate prosecutorial

Do you

I would suggest

think determining whether --

20

should a factor in determining whether tc dismiss the

21

case be that this will protect some public official?

22

MR. GARDNER:

The factor in determining

23

whether to -- well, that should be a factor.

24

it's appropriate and it's within — it should be within

25

his discretion that that be a factor, yes. Your Honor.

4

you would otherwise pursue the criminal case if it

weren’t for this factor?

6

FR.

GARDNER;

7

QUESTION;

If that were the only factor.

Well, nc, but if you say it’s a

8

factor, there are bound to be some cases where that’s

9

the factor that determines whether ycu will try the case

10

or not.
HR. GARDNER;

11
12

I would suggest that if that

were the factor -QUESTION;

13

So you

think that you’re justified

14

in trading off the public interest in having this

15

criminal case tried, against releasing the public

16

official?
HR. GARDNER;

17

I would suggest that if that

18

were' the only factor, Justice White,

19

talking about is a coercive situation, inherently

20

coercive, and I would trust the trial court to find that

21

it wasn’t a voluntary waiver.

MR. GARDNER;

coercive situation.

2

QUESTION!

Well, here’s a case where you had

3

otherwise tried -- there has to be some situations like

4

this that you would otherwise try, but you did not

5

because there is this factor of possibly gaining the

6

release of a public official?

7

MR. GARDNER:

I would suggest, Your Honor,

8

that there is absolutely no evidence in this case that

9

it would otherwise have been tried.

I don’t know -- in

10

fact, the prosecutor said, if there had net been a

11

release, I don’t know what I would have dene.
There hadn’t even been a probable cause

14

QUESTION:

Mr.

We have to presume that all of these other

22

cases would have been dismissed, or would not have been

MR. GARDNER:

25

Well, if there’s going to be a

per se rule, then obviously

that's what we have to dc.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

The Court is either going to have to presume that all of

the cases would have been dismissed or not dismissed,

and that’s the difficult--

QUESTIOH:

Which dc you think is the correct

5

presumption?

6

drawer and dismiss cases, do we assume there was merit

7

to all those cases or no ci°r it to all these cases?
MR. GARDNER:

8
9

If you’ve got, say 150 releases in ycur

I would suggest, Tour Honor,

that this Court have faith in the prosecutors of America

10

and assume that tho.se cases, if they were not

11

meritorious,

12

release, or the obtaining of a release.
I would suggest also, Your l'onor, that in an

13
14
15

would have been dismissed despite the

arrest -QUESTION:

Then really, there’s no

16

consideration for the release except that the defendant

17

got out of a

18

there’s a lot of pressure on a defendant to give a

19

release in that situation if he’s faced with a trial,

20

even if he thinks he’s going to win it .1

21

meritless criminal trial, and I suppose

MR. GARDNER!

Well, I wouldn’t say that he was

22

getting out of a meritless criminal trial, just because

23

the prosecutor determines that he’s not going to

24

prosecute the case.

25

Rumery was a middle aged man.

Prosecutors have compassion.

Mr.

He was a businessman.

He

had a reputation.

He had had no contacts with the law.

2

The prosecutor was concerned that in this case

3

the complaining witness might not be willing to testify.

4

QUESTION:

We can't really assume, in other

5

words, that all the cases that are dismissed are

6

necessarily meritless cases.

that have merit,

QUESTION;

But what you're saying is that a

MR. GARDNER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GARDNER;

I'm saying that in each --

You’re not sayinc that?
What I’m saying is that in each

4

case you have to look, at the case when the decision has

5

to be made, and determine whether at that time the

6

situation resulted from a voluntary, knowing, deliberate

7

waiver of the right to bring the action by the

3

individual.

9

QUESTION:

Can the motive of saving the city

10

from a suit, cr individual policemen from a suit, also

11

exist when a prosecutor accepts a plea bargain to a

12

lesser offense, so that in some cases where the

13

prosecutor might otherwise consider dismissing the

14

charge entirely, he insists upon accepting a plea to a

15

lesser charge in order to be sure that the city wouldn't

16

be subject to suit for false prosecution subsequently?

17

MR. GARDNER:

18

happen, and it’s obvious that --

19

QUESTION:

Well, that certainly could

Does pleading guilty to a lesser

20

included offense eliminate the possibility cf bringing a

21

false arrest or false prosecution action later?

To my understanding, it does.

22

MR. GARDNER;

25

3

constitutional rights has in effect waived his right to

4

petition the Court for redress of grievances.
It is my understanding that that was the

5
6

interpretation of the First Circuit.

There is also a

7

due process argument to the effect that if he didn't

8

waive it voluntarily, he was deprived of due process.

9

The fact in this case, and the fact that is

10

vital to this case, is that the question of the

11

voluntariness of the release has been found in this case.

20

MR. GARDNER;

I agree, and I would suggest

21

that the trial court is the best court to determine

that, and the test way to have that determined is to

give the trial court the latitude to look at whether the

Mr. Bauer, I think there is some

It certainly suggests. Your

QUESTION;

Whenever the prosecutor's act a

lousy case, that he'd

never try in a hundred years?

MR. GARDNER:

5

In this particular case --

No.

If he threatened to go on

6

with the prosecution solely in order to coerce the

release, I would suggest that that's clearly coercive.

8

In this case the prosecutor never spoke tc Mr. Rumery at

Does that mean that your rule would

cover every case, you’d say, "Well, we’ve got everything

you've got to sign this release before we do it," that
