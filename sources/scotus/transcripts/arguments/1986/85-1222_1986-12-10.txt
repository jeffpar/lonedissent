what has long been called Plan II service, where the

2

entire service is provided bv an interstate rail carrier

3

on equipment owned and operated by the rail carrier.
The ICC decided in this case that that

4

'

5

particular form of Plan II service should be subjected

6

to the system of rail carrier regulation, and not tc the

7

system of motor carrier regulation.
QUESTION;

10

Mr. Taranto, part of the equipment

is trailer rigs, truck-trailer rigs owned by the
railroad?

11

HR. TAR AN TO ;

12

QUESTION;

13
14

That’s right.

So that it travels over the road in

tractor-trailer rigs owned by the railroad; is that it?
MR. TARANTO:

That’s right.

That trucks that

15

pull the trailers or containers on the road in this case

16

are owned by the rail carrier itself.

17
18
19

QUESTION;

For you to prevail,

we have to

decide that’s a form of rail service?
MR. TARANTO:

You have to decide that that is

20

transportation provided by a rail carrier within the

21

meaning cf the Staggers Act.

22

My argument today is --

23

QUESTION;

24

Well, that -- that fact is

important to your -QUESTION:

They could just as easy said, rail.

NR. TARANTO;

2

QUESTION;

I’m sorry, Justice?

They could just as easily have

3

said, by rail, instead of saying, by a rail carrier.

4

Just to confuse us.
HR. TARANTO;

5

Well, it is true that the

6

statute generally uses the term, transportation provided

7

by a rail carrier in various places.

8

entirely consistent in its use of language.

And that it is not

9

But the phrase, transportation provided by a

10

rail carrier, under the literal definition of the word

11

transportation, includes motor vehicle as well as rail

12

movement.

13

The Interstate Commerce Commission decided in

14

this case that for the entire portion of TOFC service,

15

both the motor and the truck portion, that the proper

16

system of regulation for the entire service is the rail

17

carrier provisions and not the motor carrier provisions.

18

This case arose as a result of Congress’

19

passage of the Staggers Act in 1980.

20

which extended and furthered the deregulation policies

21

first put into place in the mid-1970s, made major

22

changes in the system of rail carrier regulation in the

23

United States .

24
25

That statute,

The general findings and policies set forth in
the statute are important to this case, because the
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

state expressly provides that individual provisions of

2

the entire Interstate Commerce Act must be interpreted

3

to further the declared national rail transportation

4

policy .

5

The Staggers -- in the Staggers Act, Congress

6

expressly found that cverregulation had contributed to

7

the financial plight of the rail industry, and that much

8

regulation was today unnecessary, largely because

9

transportation had become much more competitive.

10

It then went on to set out a new national rail

11

transportation policy, which emphasized deregulation at

12

the Federal level; maximum possible reliance cn market

13

forces in rail carriers providing transportation;

14

uniformity between State and Federal regulation;

15

particular, the promotion of intermodal transportation.

16

and, in

Congress went even one step further, and

17

expressly amended the national transportation policy

18

that applies to other modes cf transportation, to give

19

the rail policy express priority.

20

govern whenever a government action has an impact cn

21

rail carriers.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

That policy must

You say, is that explicit in the

statute, Mr. Taranto?
MR. TARANTO;

Yes, in the very first words of

Section 10101, the general national transportation
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

policy, says that the following shall govern except when

2

policy has an impact on rail carriers, in which case the

3

specific rail carrier policy will govern.

4

In

its first act pursuant to the Staggers Act,

5

new -- the Staggers Act new exemption provision, the ICC

6

determined, in this case, that both the truck and train

7

portions of rail-provided TOFC service should he exempt.

8
9

It took this action pursuant to two — to one
of the two important provisions of the Staggers Act that

10

is in issue in this case.

11

the Staggers Act added to the Interstate Commerce Act

12

changed what had been the historical practice.

13

Historically, all

The exemption provision that

rail carrier activities were

14

subject to an extensive system of regulation, covering

15

the rates charged and most other aspects of rail carrier

16

activities.

17

In

1976, Congress took one step and granted

18

the Commission power to exempt activities.

19

was a limit in that provision.

20

limited scope could be exempt.

21

But there

Only activities of

The ICC began considering whether TOFC

22

service, fell within that exemption, and Congress

23

specifically noted the potential availability of the

24

exemption provision as written when it was considering

25

the Staggers Act.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But in the Staggers Act, Congress expanded the

1

2

exemption power, and specifically directed the

3

Commission to examine rail activities to determine when

4

regulation was no longer necessary to protect shippers

5

against an abuse of market power.
Congress also added to the exemption provision

6
7

a specific section designed to promote the exemption of

8

rail -- of transportation provided by a rail carrier as

9

part of intermodal service.
The second important provision of the Staggers

10
11

Act —
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Taranto, excuse me for

13

interrupting, because you answered my question earlier.

14

But could you again give me that Section — could you

15

tell me what page of your appendix or petition that

16

section is on?
MR. TARANTO:

17

I don't believe that the

18

petition includes the general national transportation

19

policy .

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Something that critical was net

included in the relevant statutes?
MR. TARANTO:

It is included in the statutes;

23

not in the appendix here.

In Section 10101, the general

24

national transportation policy, which comes just before

25

10101a, the language I was referring to appears.

(202) 628-9300

1

The pre-emption provision of the Staggers Act

2

is the second important provision in this case.

3

that provision worked an even more fundamental change in

4

the system of rail carrier regulation.

5

And

Historically, an interstate rail carrier was

6

subjected to a dual system of regulation.

And

7

intrastate shipment was initially subjected to State

8

regulation, with appeal to the Interstate Commerce

9

Commission, to simplify matters, only if the State

10

action discriminated against or unduly burdened

11

interstate commerce.

12

Congress radically altered the balance of

13

Federal and government authority in the Staggers Act.

14

After the Staggers Act, a State was permitted to

15

continue regulation intrastate transportation only if it

16

did so in accordance with Federal standards and

17

procedures, and it had obtained certification from the

18

ICC to continue that regulation.

19

In this case, Texas has been denied

20

certification.

21

ICC decision that is at issue here was pending in the

22

Fifth Circuit.

23

It was denied certification while the

It is our position that the Fifth Circuit

decision was wrong because it took too simplistic a view

of the statutory scheme, and because it failed to give

ME. TARANTO;

I’m not aware that the

government made any argument based on the express

We showed in our brief that the language of

18
19

the two or three particular provisions at issue in this

20

case can bear the construction that the Commission gave

21

it.

22

First of all, the motor vehicle portion of

23

TOFC service in fact constitutes transportation provided

24

by a rail carrier , because transportation is given a

25

broad definition in the statute that encompasses net

just rail but also motor vehicle movement.
Second, when a rail carrier provides motor

2
3

vehicle transportation, as an adjunct to, incidental to,

4

its rail transportation, it need not automatically

5

become transformed into a motor carrier.

6

vehicle movement is by definition movement by a motor

QUESTION:

14

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

The specific question,

15

whether Congress has ever addressed itself to whether

16

truck movement can be encompassed in the rail carrier

17

provisions has a fairly clear answer.

18

Congress has simply never said anything cn

19

that subject.

What Congress has said is that it sought

20

to promote intermodal transportation, both in the

21

specific exemption provision of the Staggers Act in

22

adding, as part of the Motor Carrier Act of

23

promotion of intermodal transportation, tc the general

24

national transportation policy; and in taking a variety

of other actions.

When one turns, finally, to the general rail

1
2

carrier policy set out in the Staggers Act, nothing

3

could be clear that -- than that the ICC decision in

4

this case furthers that policy.
The ICC decision here furthers the

5

6

deregulatory policy; the policy of ensuring -- of

7

eliminating disparities betveen Federal and State

8

regulation; and the policy of promoting intermcdal

9

transportation.
It is our view that because there is nothing

10
11

specifically in the statute contrary to the ICC

12

construction of the statute; and because the ICC

13

decision here furthers the national rail transportation

14

policy; that the ICC decision was correct , and that the

15

Fifth Circuit decision should be reversed.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my

16

time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT CF MICHAEL E. ROPER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 85-1267
MR. ROPER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue before this Court is the narrow
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

question of whether Congress delegated power to the ICC

2

to exempt the motor portion cf intrastate TCFC

3

transportation provided by a rail carrier.

4

There is no dispute that the ICC dees have,

5

and did properly exercise, the power to exempt both the

6

motor and rail portion of transportation provided by a

7

rail carrier, when that transportation was on a

8

interstate basis.

9

Likewise, there is no dispute that the ICC

10

could and did exempt the rail portion of intrastate

11

TOFC-CCFC transportation provided by a rail carrier.

12

Railroad petitioners, all of whom are

13

interstate rail carriers operating in Texas, concur in

14

the analysis made by the government, and that will not

15

be repeated here, hopefully.

16

Instead, my primary focus will be on what the

17

practical effect of the decision below will be, if that

18

decision is allowed to stand.

19

Petitioning railroads will suffer real and

20

tangible harm if the motor portion of intra state TCFC

21

transportation provided by a rail carrier, is subject to

22

regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas.

23

Khile it is true that petitioners are not

24

presently engaged in a large amount of that type of

25

transportation, one reason for that is the uncertainty
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

created by the decision below.
Railroad petitioners view complete intrastate

2
3

T0FC-C0FC transportation as a necessary component of

4

their ability to be fully effective competitors in the

5

State of Texas and other large States where there is a

6

potential for long-haul transportation by rail.
The major effect of the decision below will be

7
8

to prevent railroad petitioners from competing with

9

intrastate motor carriers.
Texas has essentially conceded in its brief

10
11

that its aim is just that, to protect intrastate motor

12

carriers from competition.
One wonders why Texas is so concerned about

13
14

protecting an industry, when that industry apparently is

15

not itself concerned.
The Texas intrastate motor carriers have net

16
17

appeared at any stage of this case before the ICC or the

18

courts.

19

We believe it is safe to assume that motor

20

carriers would have contested this matter if they were

21

truly fearful of this competition.

22

In any event, railroads will not be able to

23

effectively compete because of the higher costs and less

24

flexibility associated with

25

partially regulated and partially deregulated.

Because Congress, in adopting the Staggers Act,

specifically found that separate State and Federal

But Mr. Rodriguez, if the motor

of intrastate movement is also transportation by a rail

MR. RODRIGUEZ;

Justice O'Connor, that's --

you've essentially grasped what this case is all about.
That is what it comes down to.
The ICC contends that under the definition,
that the definition is so broad that it includes this
type of traffic.

Se contend that it dees net for a

number of reasons.
Number one, there is a specific statutory
expression of power reserved to the States in 10521b,
which says specifically, that nothing in this statute is
meant to take away intrastate motor carriage regulation
from the States;

that’s a paraphrase.

But more importantly, transportation as
defined in Section 10102 — I think it's section 25 -does not mean what they say it means for a number of

Finally, Your Honor, transportation is defined

12

Clearly to me, and to the State of Texas, it

has — while it's defined broadly, it means different

Oh, no, the question is whether

this is intrastate transportation provided by a motor

boil down to the question, is this transportation

What that leads us to, then, is a

Is this a rail carrier or a

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

In this particular case -- clearly; I mean I’m

1

2

here to win the case -- I submit that ours is the best

3

interpretation.

4

And I think ours is the best interpretation

5

because it goes and turns on the plain meaning of the

6

word s.
To my way of thinking, the ICC’s

7
8

interpretation, how they get to what constitutes

9

transportation provided by a rail carrier , is tortured

10

and arduous.
Our interpretation, on the other hand,

11

basically is very clear.

QUESTION;

6

That isn't the issue.

The issue

7

is,- what is transportation by a motor common carrier,

8

and what is transportation by a railroad?

9

-- it's easy to identify what's a railroad or what's a

What's hard, and there’s really no — you

could go either way -- is whether transportation by a

It lends itself to that meaning,

certainly.

Transportation provided by a rail carrier

MR. RDDRIGUEZ;

15

Well, that's clearly the

position that the ICC is taking in this case.

with what the prior legislative -- or prior legislative

In the context of transportation provided by

a motor carrier, does it also talk about — dees it also

Are we talking about barges?

I submit to the Court that it dess not.

4

And

5

at some point you have to impose some level of logic and

clarity on this.
Another reason which I believe augurs in cur

favor and against the government is that if, in fact --

9

if, in fact,

10

-- excuse me, transportation provided by a rail carrier

11

includes transportation which otherwise would be motor

absolutely no reason to include in 105O5f the specific

And vet, even though it was put there for a

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

11

Your Honor, we believe that

the inclusion of the word, intermodal movement, is an

That type of movement is an intermodal

10

What else do you have?

11

MR. RODRIGUFZ;

Your Honor, the problem is, I

12

think, the States are being vhipsawed.

In Garcia,

13

you’ve got the States having to rely on the political

14

process to preserve their own initiatives .
And yet we have to go to Congress and depend

15
16

on Congress not to overregulate in areas which are

17

traditionally left to the States, such as this.
Nonetheless, we still have a recognition that

18
19

the States, as States, hold a special place in the

20

Federal system.
I believe there is a necessary corollary to

21

22

that.

23

confusing, if a statute is at all ambiguous, then that

24

ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the States.

25

And the corollary is, if a statute is at all

That’s the only conclusion which I can draw

from the interstate commerce cases and the Garcia case
And what we have here, Your Honor, is

3

demonstrated by the fact that the ICC uses such a

4

tortured interpretation to get to where it's going, is

5

the fact that Congress did net make the statute clear.

6

In that case, the dispute, the ambiguity must

be resolved in favor of the States.

for Congress to clarify.

They have not done that.

I do not think that

14

it is for the ICC to put that there when they are faced

15

with the specific reservation of power in 10521b.

16

If

I might just respond to a couple of points

17

that Mr. Roper made, as I stated when I started, the

18

Railroad Commission of Texas has regulated motor carrier

19

traffic in Texas intensively.

tells us that we cannot do sc, they intend tc continue

21

to do that.

But that does not

There is no unfair disadvantage imposed on the

QUESTION:

I assume the interest of the State

of Texas is to prevent this intermodal transportation

from cutting the rates below the floor that applies to

the motor carriers, isn’t that right?

14

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

15

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

They want to protect the motor

16

carriers from cutrate competition by the intermodal

17

carrier; isn't that what it is?

18

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

There is economic regulation

the carriers from what they

That is not an unfair competitive advantage.

That is an attempt to create equal markets for everybody

There is no infirmity in that.

There is no

QUESTION;

9

There is nothing which

Well, I would think you would be

10

making the same argument if

11

but the truck portion of it is wholly intrastate; but

12

you aren't.
MR. RODRIGUEZ;

it's an interstate movement,

Your Honor, if it's an

14

interstate movement,

while we might -- while the State

15

of Texas or the Railroad Commission might like to do

16

something, they simply do not have the ability to do

17

so.
Because if it’s an interstate movement, it is

18
19

without the regulation of the Railroad Commission of

Texas.
