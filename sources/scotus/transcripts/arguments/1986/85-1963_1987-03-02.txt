So the Court looked at a tax on the interstate

I’d like to move now to the top of the chart,

by the middle set of boxes there.

lines and sells it in other states.

About

It*s manufacturing in

As you can see, Washington imposes on that

7

interstate company the manufacturing tax because it has

8

chosen, instead of refraining from interstate commerce,

9

to sell across state lines.

10

Another group of our clients are represented

11

by the bottom set of boxes there.

They're in a

12

situation like Xerox Corporation.

They do their

13

manufacturing in soma other state, ship the goods across

14

state lines into Washington, and sell them there.

15

Now, whan wa looked at the local company, when

16

that local company -- when any company manufactures in

17

Washington, it incurs a liability for the tax on

18

\ manufacturing.

But if it refrains from engaging in

19

interstate commerce, if it will sell the goods in

20

Washington and pay that Washington tax on the selling

21

activity, that company will get a significant tax

22

benefit, an exemption.

23

It gets a forgiveness of the liability it had

24

already incurred for doing the manufacturing in the

25

state.

MR. YOUNG;

We're only going to impose one

I suspect the reason that Armco

wasn't decided that way was that the Court focused on

the two activities that were claimed to be essentially

the same and looked at them and realized that they

you were looking at all things that were part and parcel

13

The National Can situation is seen if we look

14

at the last two sets of boxes on the chart there, and I

think it kind of pulls all of this together, in that you

Yes,

Your Honor, because --

Well, where else are you being

MR.

O’BRIEN;

We are being taxed in the state

of Texas on these activities, because the receipts from

8

franchise tax is determined by a ratio between the gross

In fact, Your Honor, I don’t believe — and I

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I want to begin by discussing the issues
common to both'National Can and Tyler Pipe,

(202) 628-9300

\

1

discrimination ani apportionment, and then I will turn

2

to the issue of nexus, which

concerns Tyler Pipe alone.

With regard to discrimination, the commerce

3
4

clause provides that a state cannot provide through its

5

taxes a direct commercial advantage to local business.

6

On the other hand, the commerce clause does not prohibit

7

a state from encouraging intrastate commerce, for

8

competing for interstate commerce, so long as it does

9

not discrimin a tori ly tax the products or services of
other states.

10

And the key is, how do you tell discrimination

11
12

from fair encouragement?

13

Boston Stock Exchange, laid down a bright line test to

14

distinguish discrimination from fair encouragement, and

15

that test is simply this;

16

affects the direction of commerce, either by erecting a

17

barrier against interstate commerce or by telling an

18

This Court, beginning in

A

tax discriminates if it

\ interstate business that’s already present in the state

19

that it can reduce its level of taxes in the state if it

20

increases its business activity in that state.
On the other hand,

21

a tax does not discriminate

22

if it treats intrastate commerce and local business

23

equally, allowing for tax neutral decisionmaking.
And

24

Westinghouse,

25

Maryland v. Louisiana that came after it,

that’s highly

In addressing the rest of my remarks on

12

discrimination, I want to just briefly talk about the

13

tax system and then in turn discuss the selling tax and

14

the manufacturing tax.

15

the privilege of selling in Washington and on the

16

privilege of manufacturing in Washington, and the rate

17

pay one tax on the product, but you won't pay two.

MR. COLLINS;

That's correct.

paying the manufacturing tax?
MR. COLLINS;

15

that's correct , Your Honor.

If he has paid the selling tax,

Why doesn't that amount in effect

MR.

COLLINS;

20

QUESTION;

The reason it doesn’t --

Just if you view them as taxes on

separate activities, it looks pretty clear.

21

MR.

22

COLLINS;

Well, I don’t think that —

23

that’s not correct, Justice O'Connor,

and the reason is

24

because the manufacturing tax is a compensating tax,
just like the use tax is a compensating tax.

Well, Your Honor,

the Fibreboard

of course, which isn’t before this

manufactured in Washington, partially finished the

manufacturing out of the state, and then sold the

13

product back in Washington, and paid two taxes, both a

14

selling tax and a manufacturing tax.
That system would fail our bright line test,

15
16

and if any of the taxpayers here were doing business in

17

that way we would lose.

18

But the reason that it’s

\ discriminatory is because the multiple activities

19

exemption would not operate.

20

The normal rule in

Washington is you only pay

21

one tax with regard to the sale of the product, just as

22

with regard to the same product.

Are the

taxes designed to achieve equality, and do they actually

2

result in equal treatment of in-state and out of state

Now, with your example, an income tax has been

found to be a

franchise tax.

It's

In that case, California had a corporate

franchise tax imposed only on local business and it had

an income tax

and there was a multiple activities exemption that

basically said if you pay the corporate franchise tax

15

you don't have to pay the income tax.

16

And

that was imposed on interstate commerce,

the California court and this Court had no

difficulty in saying that that was not discriminatory

18

because the burdens were equal in those two taxes.

MR.

1

COLLINS:

That's right

But you have to

2

— that's the key to the decision and the key to

3

essentially tax-neutral decisionmaking.

4

reason that a compensating tax works, the engine that

5

drives it, is it passes the bright line test.

6

to say, a compensating tax is neutral with regard to the

7

direction of commerce.

That is

In Washington, if you manufacture a product in

8

9

I mean, the

this state and sell it here you'll pay selling tax.

If

10

you manufacture it In this state and sell it someplace

11

else, you’ll pay manufacturing tax, but the amount of

12

those taxes will be the same.
So there’s no incentive for you to say, I'm

13
14

going to move my manufacturing operation out of the

15

state and sell into Washington or I’m going to move my

16

manufacturing operation into the state and sell in

Scalia.

On a $1,000 -- if you manufacture a product

you'll pay $4.40 in manufacturing tax.

things that the Court looked at.
QUESTION ;

3

Well, I suppose that's the issue,

4

because here we have -- but I know you cited a case to

me, but why is it not true that if you had, if Oregon

6

It's perfectly clear it is taxed less heavily,

10
11
12

13
14
15

isn't it?
MR.

This Court has never taken into

account the taxes —
QUESTION;

Maybe we should -- I know there’s —

MR. COLLINS;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR.

QUESTION;

They

would pay more taxes.

Pardon me?

COLLINS;

They would pay more taxes.

And they pay more taxes on the

20

interstate transactions than they would pay on the

21

intrastate transactions?

22

MR.

COLLINS;

That's correct.

But, Justice

23

Stevens, that would be true in any event if you have

24

different states that have different taxes.

25

example, at the end of the Armco opinion the Court

For

3 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

stated that there would be no difficulty if Ohio had a

2

manufacturing tax and West Virginia had a selling tax.

3

Clearly that would be doubling up, and at the same time

4

an intrastate business that just did one thing would

5

only pay one tax.

6

And

that's why Southern Pacific versus

7

Gallagher is really a key case, because in Southern

8

Pacific versus Gallagher the Court was faced with

9

exactly the same situation, the possibility of no

10

doubling up in-state, sales and use tax, and a

11

possibility of doubling up out of state if a tax had

12

been paid in the other state.
And the taxpayer said;

13

There's a possibility

14

that we could be doubled up in this other state; give us

15

some relief.

And what the Court said is --

QUESTION;

16

Yes, but the difference in your

hypothetical is that if both states adopted the taxing

scheme of the other,

states.

20

MR.

21

QUESTION;

22
23

they would pay double taxes in both

COLL IS S z

That's true.

There would be no discrimination

between interstate and intrastate taxation.
MR. COLLINS;

But the Court refused, though,

24

in that case to speculate about what another state would

25

do, and that's really, I think, a correct decision and

(202) 628-9300

1

one that would be appropriate even if it was a question

2

of first impression.
The reason for that is simply this.

3

In

4

California in Southern Pacific and in this case, the

5

state of Washington relieves a business from the tax,

6

manufacturing tax, only if the selling tax is paid.

7

Those are the only circumstances in which we do it, only

8

if the selling tax is paid.
The taxpayers in Southern Pacific versus

from Washington's tax even though we don't pay a tax to

not to address that question until a taxpayer came in

two things would happen if you don't wait:

Let me turn briefly to the nexus question

2
3

raised by Tyler Pipe.

4

National Can agrees that there is enough nexus under the

5

due process and commerce clause to impose our tax upon

6

them.

7

Tyler Pipe basically argued —

Tyler Pine contests the nexus.

Now, Tyler

8

Pipe sells nroducts in Washington through

the use of

9

independent contractors who act as their sales

10

representatives.

11

the activities of the sales representatives give rise to

12

nexus without regard

to what their status is?

13

second question is i

If those representatives do enough

14

to give rise to nexas, does it make any difference that

15

they're independent contractors.

16

And there's really two questions:

Do

And the

The lower court found that the activities were

17

enough, and this Coart has ruled in decisions such as

18

Scripto versus Carson that the contractual tagging of a

19

sales representative doesn't have any constitutional

20

significance.

21

Now, counsel's argument with regard to nexus

22

really broke down to this.

He said:

Our local sales

23

representatives pay a tax and Tyler Pipe pays a tax, and

24

that somehow means that we can't tax both of those.

25

I want to sort out any confusion in your mind.

And

Ashe 5

1

Jones pays tax under the service classification.

2

They're providing a service business of representing

3

Tyler Pipe.

4

Tyler Pipe pays tax on its activity of making

5

sales in the state of Washington.

The fact that both

6

Ashe £ Jones and Tyler Pipe pay tax is irrelevant.

7

Clearly, this Court would not have a rule that said that

8

we could not impose this tax because of the independent

9

contractor nexus and yet, if we went back to our state

10

and repealed the tax on the independent contractors,

11

that suddenly there would be enough nexus to tax them.

12

The purpose of the nexus requirement is to get

13

a connection between the taxpayer and the state.

trial court in this case found that the activities of

15

the representatives were significantly associated with

16

the taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain the

17

market.

18

The

The taxpayer does three kinds of things:

19

first, they solicit sales: secondly, they gather

MR.

O’BRIEN:

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, you asked

14

about the activities -- or whether the Tyler Pipe was

15

taxed on its gross receipts, and I said no and that is

16

correct , they are not.

17

However, we had viewed and do view the law of

18

this Court that we do not have to establish that the tax

19

is in fact paid in another state, and I refer to the

20

Adams Manufacturing case and then specifically the Gwin,

21

White case, which involved the state of Washington tax,

22

where this Court said unlawfulness of the burden depends

23

upon its nature, measured in terms of its capacity to

24

obstruct interstate commerce and not on the contingency

25

(that some other state may first have subjected the

commerce to a like burden.
And

that was an apportionment case in which

3

this Court held that the tax on Gwin, White,

who would

4

have been equivalent to Asha E Jones in our case, was

5

not permissible on sales going outside the state.

6

Now, counsel — I thought it was clear,

but

7

now I think it may be confused, as to what I was trying

8

to do about showing you that the same activities were

9

used for nexus foe two different taxpayers.

We're using

10

the actions of Ashe £ Jones,

or at least the state of

12

find nexus for Tyler Pipe.
