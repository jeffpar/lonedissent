MS. HOLTZMAN;
please

Mr.

Chief Justice,

may

the Court;
The question here

is whether the Constitution

allows states, as it has allowed

the federal government,

to regulate a specific industry in order

to meet

a

15

compelling public need and to enforce that regulatory

16

scheme with warrantless inspections.

17

New York State's effort to regulate the

18

vehicle dismantlers industry for the purpose of curbing

19

the serious problem

20

economic burdens and physical safety

21

22
23

of auto

theft with its attendant
burdens falls

squarely under the well settled criteria
Colonnade and Donovan

of

Eiswell,

versus Dewey.

The New York regulatory scheme under 415-a of

24

the Vehicle Traffic law is aimed at

25

and has three interrelated components;

vehicle

dismantlers

registration

(202) 628-9300

and

1

re-registration on a periodic basis, comprehensive

2

record keeping requirements, and warrantless inspections.

3
4

The administrative purposes of the regulatory
scheme are as follows;

the protection of legitimate

5

vehicle dismantlsrs; to return more stolen cars to

6

owners, which is an important purpose in and of itself

7

and also to reduce insurance costs; by the record

8

keeping requirement to deter would-be autc thieves; to

9

trace cars back to the auto thieves; and to prevent the

10

vehicle dismantling industry from being used as a

11

mechanism for fencing stolen cars.

12

The statute at issue here has been criticized

13

as being designed to allow police officers to conduct

14

warrantless searches of inventory, and that the statute

15

serves no real administrative purpose.

16

is wrong.

17

It is wrong for a

number of reasons.

It is

18

wrong, first, because of the legislative history of the

19

statute which establishes clearly that New Ycrk State

20

first set up a reoulatory scheme that included no

21

inspection of inventory.

22

The inspection of inventory was added only six

23

years -- was added six years after the statute went into

24

effect.

25

that the other components of the regulatory scheme

What would the difficulty be, Ms.

Holtzman, of getting an administrative warrant, which of

there is no scheme allowing that in New York State, but

The complaint about the inventory inspection

23

is that it was not really done for administrative

24

purposes because there were no records there.

ordinance has been construed by a trial court, not by a

higher court, as requiring reasonable — inspections

5

While that statute might need more creative

construction to bring it into line with seme of the

Court's prior precedents, we believe that it could and

would be so construed by the New York State courts.

QUESTION;

Why don't they use administrative

officers, if this is an administrative search?

11

isn’t that part of the problem here, you are using just

ordinary law enforcement officials to conduct what you

say is an administrative search?

14

NS. HOLTZ MAN;

I mean,

Well, there is nothing in the

But we also think

that in addition to that you

have other factors affecting the nature of this industry

that reduce the level of privacy interest.

It's not the whole industry.

The

factors you have mentioned just apply to this particular

HOLTZ MAN:

MS. HOLTZMAN:

Fight.
And can expect that there will

6

be an inspection, not only of the books and records but

7

of the inventory to match against the books and records.

8

This vehicle dismantler says, I have a higher

expectation of privacy in my inventory because I am not

10

keeping books and records.

11

that gives me a higher interest of privacy in this

12

inventory.

13
14

I am violating the law and

And I submit, respectfully, that that argument
is absurd .

15

QUESTIO??:

It doesn't dive him any higher

says, I am going to violate the law by not letting you

argument, the statute is unconstitutional.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

but it wouldn't depend, therefore, on the privacy-

2

interest in an inventory created by not keeping

3

records.

4

And that’s the problem with the Court of

Appeals decision in this case.

5

The Court of Appeals said that the reason this

6

statute was net a legitimate administrative statute and

7

had no legitimate administrative purposes was because

8

there could be an inspection of an inventory in the

absence of records.
