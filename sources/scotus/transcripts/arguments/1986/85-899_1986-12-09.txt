The Connecticut trial court and the

Connecticut Supreme Court both found that the defendant

3

stated he had no problem talking to the officers but he

4

would not give a written statement without an attorney.
Mr. Barrett then proceeded to give a narrative

account of the incident, admitting that he and his

co-defendant had intercourse with their -victim.

claimed, however, that this was a consensual act,

The

At trial the defendant contended that his two

22

statements were involuntary.

However, at the conclusion

23

of a suppression hearing the trial court held that the

24

defendant had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent

25

waiver of his right to remain silent.

Therefore, the

1

two statements were both introduced.

On appeal, Hr. Barrett again contended that

3

the statements were involuntary, but he added the

contention that the statements were taken in violation

of Edwards versus Arizona.

finding was basically not challenged by the Connecticut

Supreme Court .

Instead, that Court held that the defendant's

refusal to give a written statement without an attorney

19

the purpose of the Miranda warnings is to dispel that

20

coercion that is inherent in police interrogation.

21

Additionally, Miranda is designed to assure that a

22

suspect in police custody is adequately advised of his

23

Fifth Amendment rights prior to giving any statements.

holdings, once a suspect has been adequately advised, it

The state does acknowledge that there is a

interrogation .
QUESTION:

9

Mrs. Dewey, what if a defendant --

10

or the defendant in this case in this case refused to

11

sign a written confession because of a belief that only

12

written statements could be introduced in evidence

13

against him?
MS. DEWEY:

14

Justice O'Connor, I don't believe

15

that this Court has every held that the individual

16

knowledge of a defendant or a suspect, a knowledge

17

that’s net communicated to the police officers, would

18

have any bearing on whether there was a free and

19

voluntary act by the defendant.
Of course, at a suppression hearing that would

20
21

become a factor that would be considered by the trial

22

court.

23

QUESTION:

The trial court would have to

24

determine, would it not, that the respondent knowingly

25

gave up his right, understanding that the statements
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It would still be a f actual

6

QUESTION:

Do you think that when someone, a

7

defendant, makes a waiver of this type which is

8

selective or perhaps conditional, that that suggests

9

that there may be some uncertainty on the part of the

10

defendant about what statements can be used against him?

11

MS. DEWEY:

A selective or conditional waiver

12

has never been held to be an eguivocal or an ambiouous

13

situation.

14

It could be a factor —
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't ask or suggest that

15

it was ambiguous, but does it possibly suggest a lack of

16

knowledge of

17

how the statements could be used?

MS. DEWEY:

Under the facts of a particular

18

case, it might be possible that a selective waiver, if.

19

it were somehow inherently inconsistent, could suggest a

20

lack of knowledge or could suggest that the defendant

21

did not truly comprehend his Miranda rights.

22

But again, that would be a factual

23

determination for the trial court, and in this

24

particular case the determination by the trial court was

25

that that waiver, that selective waiver, was not an

11

13

14

that he subscribed to in writing could be

Then what would the result be?
MS. DEWEY:

The result should be the same as

15

was held by the Connecticut trial court.

16

the defendant, or the suspect, hasn't made a shrewd

17

choice once advised of his Miranda rights does not tar

18

the subsequent admission of that statement that the

19

defendant subsequently makes.

20

The fact that

An ill-advised choice, an ill choice, rather;

21

a shrewd choice, a choice not in the defendant's

22

interest is not what Miranda was designed to protect.

23

Miranda was just designed to assure that the defendant

24
25

■was in fact advised.
QUESTION;

Well, he was advised and he said he
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

understood it, but in fact he didn’t understand it if he

2

thought that anything he said orally couldn’t be used

3

against him.

4

MS. DEWEY:

But in the present case, the

5

defendant himself testified that he did understand the

6

Miranda riqhts and he did understand that what was said

7

could be used against him.

8

also testified that in their perception the defendant

9

understood what the Miranda

10

rights entailed.

So, in

this case there is no guestion.

11
12

He -- and the officers had

QUESTION:

You are saying that my question is

not this case?

13

MS. DEWEY:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, part of the Miranda warning,

15

Ms. Dewey, is that whatever you say may be used against

16

you in court, isn’t it?

17

MS. DEWEY:

Yes, it is part of the Miranda

18

warning, a warning this defendant received on four

19

separate occasions.

20

he knew that his actions, his oral statement, could be

21

used against him and he also knew that for purposes of

22

his oral statement he had the right to have an attorney

23

present.

24
25

QUESTION:

Therefore, in this particular case

He said explicitly, "I knew that

anything that I say can be used against me”?

of the warning, of the Miranda warning?
MS. DEWEY;

upon each individual right they asked the defendant, "Do

"Do you understand," what?
"Do you understand what I’ve just

warnings .
QUESTION;

14

They didn’t say, "Do you understand

15

that anything you say now, we're going to use against

16

yon?"
MS. DEWEY:

17

No, I don’t believe that they used

18

those exact terms.

It would have possibly been better

19

police practice but they did not use those exact terms.
QUESTION;

20

Mrs. Dewey, may I ask you a

21

question, because you referred to what the trial court

22

found.

23

it treated it as two questions, one whether he invoked

24

his right to counsel, and then secondly whether he

25

waived the right.

As I

understood the appellate court’s opinion,

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The only question you present in your cert

2

petition goes to whether he invoked the right to

3

counsel, I believe?

4

MS. DEWEY:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
And the Supreme Court of

6

Connecticut said that the trial court impliedly found

7

that the defendant had requested counsel, and then they

8

point out in a footnote that that's what -- they support

9

that with a footnote.

10

Now, if that’s true, then we have both the

11

trial court and the Supreme Court of Connecticut

12

agreeing that there was a request for counsel, so to the

13

extent there’s a factual question, I guess they’ve

14

resolved it against you, haven’t they?

15

MS. DEWEY:

There’s an inconsistency in the

16

Connecticut Supreme Court’s decision in that regard,

17

where they state that the trial court impliedly found

18

that the defendant had requested counsel.

19

doing is taking the trial court’s holding, which is in

20

the joint appendix, and the part of that holding that

21

indicates that the defendant had no problem talking with

22

the officers but would not put anything in writing.

23

What they are

The trial court -- and that was all that the

24

trial court found about the defendant's asserting the

25

right to counsel.

There was never an explicit finding

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

by the trial court regarding an assertion of the right

2

to counsel.

3

QUESTION;

We should, appraise -- we should

4

look at the trial court’s finding ourselves and not

5

accept what the Supreme Court said about it then?

6

MS. DEWEY;

That is the state’s position» yes»

7

Your Honor, that there was never a factual finding made

8

concerning the invocation, and because there was never a

9

factual finding, the Connecticut Supreme Court by

10

applying an automatic rule whenever the word "attorney”

11

is mentioned, was in error.

12

QUESTION:

Do you

— is there any explanation

for the fact that, "I won’t make a written statement but

I will make an oral statement,” other than you can’t use

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that if respondent had known they were trying to tape

declined to talk

to them any further?

4

Do you understand my question?

10

MS. DEWEY:

11

In essence,

the Connecticut Supreme Court

12

refused to reach the issue of whether there had been a

13

waiver of rights, and whether that waiver of rights had

14

been an act of free will.

15

counsel must be narrowly construed, but here the

16

Connecticut trial court ignored the clear tenor of the

17

defendant’s own request, giving a talismanic quality to

18

the word "attorney."

19

We agree that a request for

This, in effect, engrafted an additional

20

prophylactic rule upon this Court’s Miranda mandate.

21

This unwarranted expansion of federal law created

22

obstacles to legitimate waivers and to legitimate choice

23

by defendants .

24
25

It thus restricted interrogation in ways not
contemplated by the Miranda decision.

8

9

Thank you, Ms.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court!

10

I think it’s important in the resolution of

11

this case to focus on precisely what went cn and what

12

the findings were of the lower courts, because I think

13

that frames the question that’s presented to the Court

14

h ere.

15

The first point to make, I think, in that

16

regard relates to questions that were asked by Justices

17

O’Connor, Marshall and Brennan and Scalia about

18

precisely what the suspect understood he was doing and

19

what he knew about his rights.

20

I think it’s clear on the record here that

21

respondent testified at trial.

The trial court

22

expressly found that he understood the nature of his

23

rights, he understood

24

police, and that understanding of course included the

25

statement that, "Anything you say can and will be used

what he had been told by the

18

against you at trial."

2

That factual determination was nowhere

3

challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court.

4

its opinion suggests that there's anything wrong with

5

that factual

6

Nothing in

finding by the trial court.

I think that it's also important tc recognize

7

that there's nothing inherently contradictory between an

8

understanding of that right, understanding of the

9

consequences of speaking, and the course of action

10

followed by the suspect here where he chose to make an

11

oral but not a written statement.

12

I think it is a common experience, courts have

13

frequently recognized

14

to put things in writing even though they appreciate

15

that their oral statements have legal consequences.

16

This Court encountered something very similar to this in

17

Butler versus North Carolina, where a suspect refused to

18

sign a waiver statement but proceeded to waive his .

19

rights.

20

that people simply are reluctant

The Court found that his waiver was effective

21

because, not the necessary inconsistencies, so long as

22

he appreciated what he was doing.

23

didn't make a sensible distinction in his actions is net

24

of any relevance for purposes of Niranda.

25

The fact that he

Courts of appeals and other lower courts have
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

encountered situations almost identical tc the one

2

involved in this case where a suspect refuses to put a

3

statement in writing, refuses to sign a statement.

4

Those courts have recognized that suspects frequently

5

are simply reluctant to put statements in writing even

6

though they fully appreciate the nature and consequences

7

of what they are doing.
QUESTION!

10

In any of those cases was the

refusal accompanied by a request for counsel as it was

MR. ROTHFELDj

11

Well, I think in those cases

they have refused at least on some occasions to sign

13

statements without the advice of counsel.

to hold -- the Connecticut Supreme Court, I think

to a halt until an attorney is present.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think as I was

10

suggesting, there are these two types of reasons the

11

suspect may rationally make that distinction.

12

think that it is in his interest to try tc talk his way

13

out of it, but that he is reluctant to commit himself in

14

writing because if he wants to change his story, it

15

would be more effective if there is no written

statement, that in that case it would only be his word

17

against the policeman’s.

He may

So, there are all kinds of entirely rational

18

reasons that a suspect may make the distinction.

20

suspect may in fact be right, that an oral statement

carries less weight with the jury than a written

Mr.

Genuario, I'm not sure I

4

counsel was requested for any -- before making any

It seemed perfectly clear on its face that

6

What’s ambiguous about that?

7

MR. GENUARIO:

I think, there is quite a bit

8

ambiguous about it# Your Honor# and the ambiguity arises

9

on two levels.

In the first place it is ambiguous as

10

to, under what circumstances the defendant is willing to

11

speak without counsel.

12

The defendant said --

13

QUESTION:

He said# "I’m willing to speak

14

without counsel but I won't sign anything in writing

15

without counsel."

Nov, how is that ambiguous?

I can understand that conceivably there might

16
17

be some question about his knowledge of whether the oral

18

statements could be used.

19

there’s any ambiguity.

20

MR. GENUARIO;

I fail to understand how

21

the defendant did not say that, "I will net sign a

"Nothing in writing" was the testimony of Officer

ambiguity, what do those words mean?
QUESTION;

3

Hue

4

not only said, "nothing in writing," he said, "as much

5

as you want orally."
That is from the statements.

6

The police

7

officer says, "He indicated to me that he would not give

8

the police any written statements but he had no problem

in talking about the incident."
Again, "He would, give no written statement to

said he would converse.

19

ME. GENUARIO:

20

It's very clear that he not only said that

That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor, and the question --

21

QUESTION;

Well, what's ambiguous about that?

22

MB. GENUARIO:

Well, let me illustrate it this

23

way.

If we asked ten Wallingford police officers what

24

Mr. Barrett meant by, "Nothing in writing but I'll be

25

harpy to talk about it; I have no problem in talking
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

about it," I’m sure those ten Wallingford police

2

officers would say that, "Nothing in writing and no

3

written statement," in that context means that, "We

4

won’t take out a particular form and we wen't have Nr.

5

Barrett write out a statement and we won't have Hr.

6

Barrett sign

that statement.

On the other hand, if we asked ten

7

19 or

8

20-year old individuals who had no prior dealing with

9

the police, as in the case of my client, that what the

10

words "nothing in writing" mean, I suggest that they

11

would say, "It means you’re not going to write down what

12

I say."

13

I might emphasize, one of the arguments that

14

Attorney Dewey gave during oral argument was one of the

15

reasons somebody would make that distinction is because

16

he wouldn’t want his statement preserved.

17

that the ambiguity,

18

basis upon which — the very fundamental basis upon

19

which the defendant was willing to speak with the police.

20

QUESTION:

I suggest

"nothing in writing," deals with the

So, you would have no quarrel,

21

then, under these circumstances if the police had net

made any notes of defendant’s statements and had simply

relied on their recollection in the testimony at trial?

QUESTION:

Well, could you answer my question?

2

MR. GENUP.RIO;

Certainly, Ycur Honor.

In that

3

situation, I think that the statements world still he

4

excluded and the reason for that is that he has

5

expressed affirmatively a desire for assistance of

6

counse1.
There are two questions here.

7

8

Cne is whether

it was ambiguous, and two, whether it was selective.
QUESTION;

9

Now, do you agree that my

10

hypothesis meets your ambigucusness argument?

11

words, the ambiguity as you see it, I understood, was

12

that he might have meant that nothing should be written

13

down.

14
15
16

In other

My hypothesis is, nothing is written down.
Does that meet your ambiguity problem?
MR. GENU.APIO;

It

does on the first level,

17

Your Honor, but it doesn't answer the question that

18

Justice Marshall has asked, doesn't it imply that he

19

doesn't understand the distinction and that therefore

20

the reason he wants counsel, and the request for counsel.

21

QUESTION;

Well, I think alot of people

22

probably didn't realize that Miranda was quite this

23

complicated.

24

hearing like this could go on for days, while we get

25

into first levels of ambiguity and second levels of

It’s a fairly complicated process, I take it,

2
3

in your view.

4

MR . . GENUARIO ;

On

the contrary, Your Honor.

5

The position that we take is a fairly straightforward

6

position, that if the defendant has affirmatively

7

requested counsel, and not just in any setting but the

8

setting where he’s dealing with the police and he wants

9

counsel to assist him in dealing with the police, that

10

under Edwards all we're asking is that the police step

11

position, that there just can't be a selective waiver.

Nothing we're saying would

consistent with Edwards.

19

best factual pattern is a reading of the facts in

waiver .

22

Matter of fact, perhaps the

But in the Edwards case, the defendant invoked

23

his right to counsel and the Arizona Supreme Court and

24

this Supreme Court found that he had in fact invoked his

right to counsel by using the words, "I dc not want to

to counsel.

I think it's ingrained in the Edwards

counsel is, "I would like to have counsel before this

goes much further."

Similarly, in Oregon

What I would suggest to this Court is that if

16
17

we too narrowly construe request for counsel, then the

18

ease with which that right can be circumvented becomes

19

too apparent.

20

facts in this case are illustrative of that, "I will not

is a claim that at that point, at that point the

interrogation should cease because it’s more important

MS. DEWEYi

Just briefly, Ycur Honor.

2

The defendant in this case was given control

3

over the course of his interrogation.

He was given a

4

choice by the police officers, and the police officers

5

respected that choice.
My opponent suggests that, what the defendant

6
7

did in this case was give an ambiguous statement, and

8

that that ambiguity that he alleges mandates a

9

presumption that there has been invocation of the right

10

to counsel.

But that is a factual question that was

11

never reached by any of the courts below.
He is relying upon a factual determination

12
13

that was never made by the trial court or by the

14

Connecticut Supreme Court.

15

Supreme Court applied a bright line rule;

16

word "attorney" is mentioned, it is automatically an

invocation of a right to counsel.
