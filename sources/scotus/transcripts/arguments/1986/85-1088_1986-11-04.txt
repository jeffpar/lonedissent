Justice's.

I would rather hear you argue the other

coward's way out and follow your suggestion.

the federal-state relations question

really has to be looked at analytically two ways;
First, as to whether it's a matter that's

controlled by the federal rules, in which case it comes

under Hanna versus Plumer.

If not, then we have to

As I see it — and we made a note of this in

20

our reply brief — the difference between the parties is

21

that they claim that there must be a direct conflict in

22

the sense that there must be a word to be found in the

23

federal rules of appellate procedure or a sentence which

24

specifically prohibits an affirmance penalty for tnere

25

to be a conflict between the state — the federal
