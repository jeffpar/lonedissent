Mr. Jones, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY S. JONES, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

MR. JONES:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

9

This veterans* rights case is here on appeal

10

from the Court of Appeals of the State of Tennessee, the

11

Supreme Court of that great state having denied

12

application for permission to appeal, which is in the

13

nature of a writ of certiorari.

14

The issue in this case is whether the scheme

15

which the states have devised to circumvent federal law

16

frustrates a federal purpose and violates the expressed

17

intent of Congress when it enacted the Veterans'

18

Benefits Act.

19

There are three federal statutes which are

20

primarily at issue in this case.

21

the Veterans' Benefits Act,

22

States Code.

They are all found in

Title 33 to the United

They are 211(a), 3101, and 3107.

23

The United States government has joined in

24

this case as amici and the government is in a better

25

position to argue the federal law than I, so with the

Court's permission I will touch on those statutes but
defer the in-depth discussion to the United States
government.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, let me straighten myself

out on some factual matters.

The marriage of these two

people took place after his Vietnam injuries, I take
it?

He was fully disabled when they were married?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice White.
So the children came along also

after the disability?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Did the Tennessee courts order --

do any more than to require that he pay $800 a month?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION;

Two hundred dollars per month?
Eight hundred dollars, whatever the

figure was.
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

It was $800 per month. Your Honor.
Did it do any more than that?

It

did not direct any allocation of the disability benefits
directly ?
MR. JONES:

No, Your Honor.

That is where we

contend that there was an attempted — or where the
State did circumvent the expressed intent of Congress.
QUESTION;

But the order itself merely placed

on him an obligation to pay $800 a month.

If he had

of that, couldn’t he?

There would be no question.

would not be hers if that were the case.
QUESTIONS

And ths order did not tell him —

6

or did it, that is what I as asking

7

your disability payment to satisfy the support

8

obligation ?

9

We

HR. JONESs

-- to use $800 of

The court did not state that.

But

10

the facts show that $500 par month must come from

11

veterans disability benefits or from property which was

12

accumulated by the use of veterans disability benefits.

13
14
15

QUESTIONS

Well, suppose he had inherited some

money in the meantime?
MR. JONES:

If it had been a substantial

16

amount so that he could have made his child support

17

payments, we would not be here.

18

QUESTION:

Do you contend

-- let me just be

19

sure I understand.

20

pension payments could have been used or could not have

21

been used to satisfy an obligation?

22
23
24
25

The property accumulated from the

MR. JONESs

I am sorry.

I didn't understand

the question.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing instead of $800 a

month, he had a Jaiillac or something he bought with
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

veterans payments and the order had said, don’t pay $800

2

a month, sell the Cadillac and give the proceeds of sale

3

to your dependents.

4

Would that violate the statute?

5

HR. JONESi

Yes, it would violate the intent.

6

I don’t think it would violate the statute per se.

7

the statute states that the veterans benefits are exempt

8

from levy, attachment or seizure both before and after

9

receipt by the beneficiary.

10

But

Now, the cases which deal with that problem

11

outside the domestic relations area indicates that the

12

funds which are used to purchase assets, or the assets

13

that are purchased from these funds are likewise exempt

14

because Congress stated that the funds were exempt both

15

before and after receipt by the beneficiary.

16
17

QUESTIONI

Mr. Jones, the record shows, I take

it, that Mr. Rose had $7,000 accumulated?

QUESTION*.

23

MR. JONES:

I see.
But the proof would show that that

24

money came from the Veterans Administration from a grant

25

that was given to Mr. Rose to help defray the cost of a

And is that money subject to the

10

same legal restrictions that the disability payments,

monthly disability payments are under?

12

H3 . JONES;

Justice O’Connor, it is my

13

understanding that any money which comes from the

14

Veterans Administration is subject to the

15

anti-attachment provisions in 3101.

QUESTION;

And whatever money was available to

HR. JONES;

money which comes to a disabled veteran.

That is correct, Your Honor, and I
When I talk in terms of

Any money that comes for other reasons is not
at issue here, and I couldn’t answer that with regards

to money that might come through the Veterans

2

Administration for a veteran who is not disabled.

3

situation here is that we have a highly decorated

4

Vietnam veteran who received some 15 citations including

5

the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, the Bronze Star for

6

valor, and the Purple Heart among the others.

The

Mr. Bose lost both of his legs, his right

8

hand, and a portion of his right arm in addition to his

9

right eye in combat in the former Republic of Vietnam.

10

As a result of those injuries Mr. Rose received a

11

medical discharge from the United States Army and was —

12

at that time began receiving these veterans disability

13

benefits which are at issue here today.

14

While he was recuperating in a Veterans

15

Administration hospital he met Mr. Rose who was assigned

to his care.

end result of that courtship in

18

A courtship followed and marriage was the
1973.

After the two children, and about ten years

19

later, Mrs. Rose filed for divorce, was granted a

20

divorce from the veteran, and was awarded custody of the

21

two minor children.

time to the point that he was probably in a state of

23

shock.

Mr. Rose was despondent at that

He didn't even contest this at that time.
contested none of this at that time.

3

Mr. Pose consulted

After advising him that in my opinion he may

have rights under the Veterans' Benefits Act, I advised

he would probably go to jail.

which is the minimum amount that is designated by the

Veterans Administration for the benefit of the children

11

who ace not living with the veteran.

12

That brought it to a head real quickly.

He

13

was in fact incarcerated for a short period of time and

14

we brought this case up through the state courts and are

15

now here asking the Court, this Court, the Supreme Court

16

of the United States, to determine whether what we have

17

here is in fact a levy, an attachment or a seizure of

18

'

these veterans disability benefits.

19

The logic of the State is this —

20

QUESTION:

That has to be your position, isn’t

21

it, that it equates with an attachment, or if you will,

22

a garnishment?

MR. JONSSi

24

Yes, Your Honor.

A right without

the ability to assert that right is no right at all.

4

QUESTION;

The decision, Mr. Rose, is

Mr. Jones, if this were a similar

5

provision in a spendthrift trust in the private sector

6

rather than in a statute, I suppose there is

7

considerable authority that

correct, that support payments can be ordered and can be

9

enforced by contempt proceedings and are not subject to

10

the State’s position is

the spendthrift trust provisions.

11

Is that right?

12

MR. JONES;

I cannot answer that, Your Honor.

13

I would be glad to brief it, if it would shed light for

14

this Court.
We think:, though,

15

that the Act of Congress

16

which has vested jurisdiction of these funds for child

17

support matters in the Veterans Administration, is

18

'

conclusive and controlling, particularly in light of the

19

fact that there’s the anti-attachment provisions in the

20

law which is very similar to what this Court decided in

21

Hisguierdo in 1979 and McCarty versus McCarty in

22

which Congress re-examined those and passed new laws but

23

as in those cases, this is a question for the Congress

24

to determine and not for the states in an effort to

25

override or circumvent the laws which Congress had

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, your basic argument is

3

that Congress wanted this money to be for the exclusive

4

use of the veteran and not to be allocable to his

5

dependents?

6

MR. JONES:

No, Justice Scalia.

That is not

7

what the law is at all.

8

the purpose or the intent is that the Administrator of

9

the Veterans Administration is in a better position to

The law says that — I think

weigh the needs of the disabled veteran and

11

the family, and because there is a national interest

12

involved here, raising a military and providing for the

13

military, that if the family has to suffer because the

MR. JONES:

Does he do it on a

No, lour Honor.

The Veterans

Administration has promulgated regulations wherein a

be apportioned according to the equities of the case.

3

QUESTION:

Sr. Jones, do you really think that

4

some remote, distant federal institution like the

Veterans Administration is in a better position as a

practical matter to consider the details and equities of

all these thousands of cases and to consider the real

needs of the children and the disabled veteran, than

handled?

to respond to that.

MR. CLEGSi

I will address that, and feel free

to remind me if I overlook that.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court;
The issue in this case is whether a state

6

court can require a divorced veteran to pay over part of

7

his disability benefits for child support, or whether

8

that kind of apportionment can be made only by the

9

Veterans Administration.

10

This case is not about whether appellees

11

should get chili support from Mr. Rose's benefits or

12

even about how much child support she should get.

13

about who decides these questions, the state court or

14

the Veterans Administration.

15

QUESTION;

It is

Let me ask you, Mr. Clegg, and I

16

think it has been gone into before but I want to make

17

certain I understand.

18

that the state court entered an order requiring that Mr.

19

Rose pay $800 a month for child support?

MR. CLEGS;

MR. CLEGG:

QUESTION;

24

MR. CLEGG:

QUESTION:

What actually happened here is

That is correct.
Was there any effort to garnish?
No, there was not.
Or attach?
Let me give the -CAn you answer whether or not there

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

was any effort?
MS. CLEGS:

2

No, there was not.

However, it is

3

clear from the proceedings that the court knew that the

4

payments would have to come from these veterans

5

disability benefits, and the court said -- knew that,

6

and saying that said to Mr.

7

support that you have fallen behind in or you will go to

8

jail."

9

QUESTION:

10

attachment or a garnishment?

11

Rose, "Pay this child

But why does that equate with an

MS. CLEGG:

Why isn't it a seizure?

I think

12

that our argument is that reading 38 U.S.C. 3101(a), it

13

is an attachment levy or seizure.

14

"Payments of benefits due or to become due under any law

15

administered by the Veterans Administration shall be

16

exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claim of

17

creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy

18

or seizure by oc under any legal or equitable process

19

whatever" —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CLEGG:

22

QUESTION:

23

3101(a) reads,

But where was this -— "before or after" -Where was the attachment or

garnishment or seizure anywhere along the line?

24

MR. CLEGG:

25

QUESTION;

Your Honor, the -The Veterans Administration still

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

paid it monthly direct to the veteran?

2

MR. CLEGS:

That's right, and he would get it

3

and if he was willing to stay in jail he could continue

4

to receive it.

5

6

That's correct.

I don't think that that is a fair reading of
3101.

7

I don't think that -QUESTION:

If he owed some merchant and the

8

merchant sued and the court ordered the veteran to pay

9

the creditor out of his check, that statute would bar it

10

because the funds are exempt from the claims of

11

creditors, is that it?

12

MR. CLEGG:

That's right, and that's the

13

second string to our bow, is that we think that Mrs.

14

Rose here is a creditor.

15

language of attachment, levy and seizure need not be met.

If that is correct, then the

16

Again, though, I don't think it is proper to

17

read the evidently very broad language of Section 3101

18

in such a narrow fashion, and the Court in the

19

Hisguierdo case was reading an almost identically worded

20

section 231-M and did not feel so constrained.

enter the judgment?
Maybe it wouldn't be collectable, but could

3

they defend the suit if, say, he bought some new clothes

4

or a car or something and ran up a bill of a couple

5

thousand dollars at a store and the store then sued him

6

for the $2,000 and he defended on the ground, "The only,

Could he do that?

Well, they could get the judgment,

—

MR. CLEGS;

The judgment, fine, but when the

court turns to him and says, "Pay this or go to jail" —
QUESTION;

All right.

So that, is it, just by

15

analogy then, is the order requiring the payment of $800

16

a month different from the judgment?

17

say, "Go to jail or pay it," maybe.

18
19

20

Maybe the — or

Is the ocder of the Tennessee court itself
requiring the payment contrary to the federal statute?
MS. CLEGG;

I think that it is in this context

21

where, you knew, the sheriff was there and the Court

22

turned to the sheriff and said, you know, "Take him into

23

custody," and where he was in fact in custody an

24

incarcerated in this case.

25

QUESTION;

That's the only position you can

talcs, isn’t it?

MR. CLEGG;

QUESTION;

4

MR. CLEGG;

I’m sorry?
That the only position you can take.
Hell, I think that even — I’m not

5

sure about that. Justice Blackmun.

6

in this case he was in fact put in jail, even if the

7

court order was not violative of Section 3101, that the

8

judgment of the Tennessee Court of Appeals affirming

9

that order was.

10

QUESTION;

I think that because

Hell, are the contempt proceedings

11

where the Court tells him to go to jail — it is

12

ordinarily separate from the order requiring him to pay,

13

isn’t it?
/

14

MR. CLEGG;

15

QUESTION;

That’s correct, but -Was it separate here?

I mean, was

16

an order first entered requiring him to pay $800 a month

17

and then when he was unable to comply he was held in

18

contempt?

19

MR. CLEGG;

I believe that the sequence was

20

that that order was entered.

21

Mr. Rose said, "I don’t believe that I have to pay this

22

until the Veterans Administration has apportioned the

23

amount .”

24
25

There was a hearing where

The Court said, "I don’t believe that that’s
what the law is.

Pay it or you will go to jail.”

Rose could have done.

2

For example, they could have found that this

3

was an unfit person to get an allocation, "Therefore,

4

we're not going to give it regardless of the needs of

the children."

6

QUESTION;

I take it, though, Mr. Sherrod,

7

it's your position that if she had gone, maybe after a

8

delay and gotten, say three or four hundred dollars a

9

month from the direct payment out of the Veterans

10

Administration, you could then have gone back to the

11

Tennessee court and said, "This isn't enough, we need an

12

additional allotment"?

13

MR. SHERROD;

Yes, Your Honor.

So you could have had both, I

15

suppose, at least theoretically, under your view of the

case?

17

MR. SHERROD;

Yes, Your Honor, but all you get

18

— you're not getting the same thing.

19

16

There is no major damage which we can see

2

it’s a pretty strong argument that an order committing

3

Mr. Rose for contempt for failure to pay the child

4

support payments would come under the definition of

5

attachment, levy or seizure by any legal or equitable

6

process whatever?

7

MR. SHERROD:

No,

Mr. Chief Justice, because

8

the order doesn't interfere with the flow of money from

9

the VA to the veteran.

It’s not — and were the

10

government to make the statement that this protection of

11

anti-attachment follows what is purchased by the funds,

12

I believe th t to be incorrect.

13

QUESTION:

But how about the language at the

14

very end of 38 U.S.C. 3101 where it says, "either before

15

or after receipt by the beneficiary"?

16

MR. SHERROD:

Are you talking about where

17

there is a contempt action that, you are going to jail

18

if you don’t pay this money?

Well, the language I just read said

20

that you can’t have equitable process or attachment or

garnishment,

2

So, I would say that it would not be

3

applicable, not that it couldn’t be called an equivalent

4

process.

5

I just think, it would not be applicable.
The case that comes to mind is Robison where

6

there was a review of educational benefits and the

7

Veterans Administration -- in that particular case it’s

8

"state jurisdiction is not judicial review."

9

trying to liken that the contempt is not

the equivalent

10

-- it’s not trying to place judicial review or Veterans

11

Administration use or the allocation of specific

12

veterans funds to a use which they were not supposed to

13

be applied.

14

I think none of those apply in this case.

QUESTION:

I sras thinking the contempt

15

citation was analogous, or at least might be governed by

16

the language, "attachment, levy or seizure by any legal

or equitable process whatever."

18

If you are told, you know, either you pay this

money out of the $303 or you go to jail, that certainly

comes pretty close to any kind of legal or equitable

2

they're using it for in this case.

3

I guess that's what I am trying to say.

I

4

would also say that our argument would be the same if

the veteran were injured after or — it doesn't make any

6

difference whether his disability occurred before o-r

7

after he married and had children.

8
9

He feel that it's a choice that he makes.

In

a particular case, had he married and had children, you

10

know -- I think every person is chargeable with the fact

11

that if you have children you're going to have a duty to

Cody.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST;

17

I*d reiterate that.

MR. CODYi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

22

It is the position of the State of Tennessee

23

that Congress has not pre-empted in this case the

24

traditional function of the states in determining child

25

support.

The Tennessee statute is constitutional on its

conflict with federal law and no major damage to clear

and substantial federal interest in this case.

QUESTION;

that there is no expressed

What do you feel is the purpose of

5

the provision that allows the Administrator to

6

apportion?

7

What is it there for?
NR. CODY:

Justice, it is our view that 3107,

8

which is the apportionment statute, is an administrative

9

aid in child suppoct enforcement.

It is an alternative

10

and a parallel proceeding which is compatible with state

11

court enforcement.

12

It is a method that allows the government to

13

make direct payments to the children, something that of

14

course the state court cannot do.

15

addition to or when state court remedies are unavailable

16

or inapplicable.

17

It is available in

When this statute was originally passed in

18

1924 it primarily was concerned with incompetence, and

19

it still applies in that situation.

20

case where there was a separation but not a divorce,

21

where the husband is in another state or where they

22

might not even know where the husband is.

23

There might be a

It is a way that the government can assist in

24

a direct payment.

We think the statute is clear that it

25

is not exclusive.

The language -- the word

'•may" is

used twice in the statute

2

The state court in its order is not making an

3

apportionment.

4

It's not executing on a federal interest.

5

no division of that interest.

6

It’s not doing anything akin to 3107.
And there's

The state believes that this Court, as well as

7

Congress, has recognized that domestic relations

8

including the protection of children and the support of

9

children belongs to the laws of the state, and the state

10

courts provide forums and have historical expertise and

11

the ability to give a comprehensive review to support,

12

custody and visitation, all of those things that are

13

involv ed.

14

So, there has developed an area, I believe, in

15

the law which requires a presumption against pre-emption

16

in the field of domestic relations.

17

positively require by direct enactment, before this

18

pre-emption will be presumed.

Congress must

The consequences of the conflict, if they

20

could be found in one of these three statutes which we

21

submit are not there, those conflicts would have to

22

sufficiently injure a federal program so as to reguire a

non-recogniti on.

24
25

We believe that here there is no major damage
to any clear and substantial federal interest.

The

1

purpose hera, as indicated earlier, is that if a veteran

2

is disabled that he and his dependents will have a

3

source of income to replace these lost earnings.

4

I think, as Justice O'Connor indicated, there

5

is a body of

6

Westmore decision in 1904, that says that children are

7

not creditors and child support is not a debt; that this

8

exemption in

9

not for the veteran against his family.

10

law from this Court beginning with the

3101 is for the veteran and his family and

Prior judicial considerations in this area, we

11

think overwhelmingly show that the courts -- the D.C.

12

Circuit, two decisions there, and nine states have held

13

that child support is not within exemptions, and

14

Congress has re-enacted this statute many times without

15

significant change.
We believe that there was a desire on the part

16
17

of Congress to protect veterans from creditors and not

18

to protect veterans from state courts; that if Congress

19

had intended the 3137, the apportionment aspect, to be a

20

sole recourse rather than an ancillary and an assisting

21

resource, then it could have said so clearly.
We submit that under the facts of this case,

22

23

that there has been no damage to any substantial federal

24

interest.

25

interest here is that if a veteran believes that his

It is suggested by the Solicitor that the

39

(202) 628-9300

1

disability benefits might be awarded, to his children by

2

a state court that somehow he might conceal his injury.

3

That does not seem to be a strong purpose

4

because military pay is already subject to garnishment

5

itself, and we believe it untenable that Congress would

6

have intended that this result would happen.

7

QUESTION:

General Cody, your argument raised

8

a question in my mini about these 27,000 cases over at

9

the Veterans

Administration.

You suggest that many of

10

them may be voluntary arrangements where there is not

11

necessarily a divorce situation but where there is a

12

reason why they would not want to pay the money directly

13

to the veteran bat might to

14

a dependent.

I just notice the statute authorizes payment

15

to, on behalf of the veteran, spouse, children or

16

dependent parents.

17

19

20

But this case doesn't involve a

It’s an ex-spouse.
Do you agree that they actually make these

payments to former spouses as well as spouses?
SR. CODY:

If the Court please, Mr. Justice, I

21

think that one of the difficulties that we have in this

22

record is the way this case came up, there is very

23

little information as to how the VA procedure does work

24

because the apportionment situation did not occur.

25

When the Solicitor mentioned in that regard

that it could ba 23 percent as a minimum given, under

2

the regulations that apparently only applies to a

3

hardship situation and not a regular apportionment.

4

It is difficult for me to answer your question

5

but I think that we would have to say that if the

6

apportionment statute means anything at all, that it

7

would have to be available to a separated or a former

8

spouse.

9

that, in line with the 1975,

them, and this is just a way that the federal government

assists in what is primarily a state, traditional state
