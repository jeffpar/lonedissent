ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

you are

Hr. Chief Justice* and gay

It

please the Court;

12

This case

Involves the

issue of

whether and

13

under what circumstances an employer* purchasing the

assets of a defunct business enterprise* must

recognize

That is correct* Your Honor

This Court Bust decide whether Fall River
should be considered a successor for the purposes of
collective bargaining when the employees of

its

predecessor constituted a minority of all of the
eaployees of Fall River at the full complement date* but
also when the employees of the predecessor constituted a
majority at an earlier date* the substantial complement

We have some guidance from this Court in how

issue* and if I may quote

very briefly from the opinion of this Court
Johnsons

in Howard

this Court held that the real question in each

of these successorship cases is on the particular facts*
what are the

legal obligations of the new employer to

the eaployees of

the former owner or their

r epr esentat ive•

2
22

particular

The answer to this* according to this Court*
requires an analysis of the Interests of the new
employer and the employees* and of the policies of the
labor laws

in light of the facts of each case and the

particular

legal obligation which

Is at

issue* whether

Mr. Drogin» I take it that In

going to be treated as conclusive unless they are not
