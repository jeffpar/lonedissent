It held that ERISA

The Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit

4

reversed, holding that Mr. Dedeaux's state common law

5

claims of general application were preserved by the

'6
7
8
9

so-called insurance saving clause of ERISA which keeos
from preemption the state laws that regulate insurance.
Now we say that that decision is wrong.

The

Congress in enacting ERISA sought to preempt all of the

10

state law that came within the sphere of the statute,

11

that the saving clause is not applicable to state laws

12

like this because they don’t regulate insurance and

13

that, in any event, it was plain that Congress sought to

14

prevent the direct application of any state law to an

15

employee benefit plan.

16

In cases like this which involve- federal

17

preemption of state law, this Court has said, as it did

18

most recently in California Federal v. Garrett, decided

19

last week, that its sole task is to ascertain the intent

20

of Congress, and to do that it looks at the language and

21

the legislative history, and the structure and purpose

22

of the statute.

23

The key language here is found in Section 514

24

of ERISA, it’s entitled, "Effect on Other Laws."

25

Section 514(a), is a sweeping, express provision for
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

preemption.

2

state laws that may now, or hereafter, relate to any

3

employee benefit plans.

It says that ERISA supersedes any and all

4

It's followed in 514(b), by the so-called

5

saving clause, which provides that nothing in ERISA

"6

shall exempt any person from any law of any state that

7

regulates insurance.

8

followed and modified by the so-called "deemer clause"

9

which provides that no employee benefit plan shall be.

And that clause is immediately

10

deemed to be an insurance company or engaged in

11

insurance for purposes of any state law purporting to

12

regulate insurance.

13

Now there are two things to notice about the

14

language in 514.

15

the term, "state law that regulates insurance," it is

16

using a terra of art and in this instance one that has

17

acquired very specific meaning through years of

18

interpretation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

19

The first is that when Congress uses

The second is that

Congress very plainly

20

showed its purpose to prevent any direct regulation of

21

employee benefit plans by state laws.

22

finding of this Court in the case of Metropolitan Life

23

v. Massachusetts, decided a couple of years ago, where

24

the Court said that the purpose of the deemer clause is

25

to take out of the operation of the saving clause any

(202) 628-9300

1

state laws that apply directly to an employee benefit

2

plan .
These state common law claims not only apply

3
4

directly to the employee benefit plan, but they clash

5

directly with the key provision of ERISA with the

"6

provisions dealing with fiduciary responsibility# claims

7

review, civil enforcement remedies.

8

functions of ERISA.

These are the core

They go to the very heart of ERISA regulation

9

10

and that’s why Congress provided that they couldn’t be

11

regulated by state law.

12

ERISA plainly confirms the intent of Congress, that the

13

fiduciary standards of ERISA, govern the entire claims

14

administration process.

The legislative history of

That was the finding of this Court in Mass.

15
16

Mutual v. Russell, decided also a couple of years ago.

17

It’s in the opinion of the Court and it's very expressly

18

in Justice Brennan *s concurring opinion as well.
Congress intended that ERISA provide a uniform

19

20

source of law for evaluating fiduciary standards, that

that it would net take the form of damages, punitive or

QUESTION;

NOLAN:

Punitive damages?
Yes.
Now, Mr. Nolan, why isn’t it a

regulation of insurance if there is a state law that

7

says insurance companies must act promptly on claims and

8

if they don’t there’s -- then the insureds have

9

remedies?

Now, if an insurance company is stuck in

10

violation of that law, if it has to pay some money, it

11

comes out of its pocket, doesn’t it?

12

regulation of a plan?

13

MR.

NOLAN;

Why is that a

Well, I think that in, where a

14

plan exists, as it does in this case, the claims

15

administration is provided by the named fiduciary.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR.

NOLAN:

All right.
This Court has recognized that

18

that whole function is controlled, governed by federal

19

law under ERISA and the fiduciary standards of that law

20

are applicable .

21

QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, that may be

22

so, but you think this, why should a state be preempted

23

from providing a further remedy for a violation of a

24

federal standard?

25

1

clearest answer to that, Justice White, is shown by the

2

circumstances cf this case.

3

accurate to say, beyond question, that if punitive

4

damages are available under state remedies, no

5

participant, no beneficiary, not Mr. Dedeaux nor anyone

else, will utilize the provisions of Section 503 of
ERISA which provides for claims review.

Perhaps

you could say he has to

exhaust those remedies before he can have an independent
action.
MR. NQLANt

Well, you could, but his remedies

12

there I guess would be viewed as never adequate if he

13

had a shot at punitive damages in a state court.

14

isn’t just that Mr. Dedeaux did this.

15

unmistakably clear that every litigant similarly

16

situated would do it.

that the plans subject to ERISA needed to be freed of

serving to insure that ERISA plan.

So, we

And if anything at all seems clear from the

7

history, the congressional and legislative history, of

8

ERISA, it would seem to be that remedies provided for

9

employees covered by an ERISA plan, whether insured or

10
11

not, are limited to those spelled out in the legislation.
And so I think there a very logical argument

12

can be made and is being made that the deemer clause

13

backs out of the savings clause at least the remedies

14

provided for an insured employee.

15

MR.

WALKER;

Your Honor, that's certainly the

argument the petitioner is making.

deemer clause only limits the savings clause and the

distinction has been made by this Court in the

'6

This Court has said that

regulating an insurance company and an insurance-funded
