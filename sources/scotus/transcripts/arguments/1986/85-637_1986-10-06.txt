QDESTIONi

MR. KNEEDLERi

But the statute calls it escheat?
The statute does call it

5

escheat.

6

as Congress having designated the tribe as the heir, the

7

statutory heir of the interests when the Indian dies.

8

However it is characterized, Congress has chosen tc keep

9

the property in Indian hands rather than to have it

It would also be possible to characterize it

portions.

Incidentally, how big are the

MR, KNEEDLER;

Under the Act the cnly thing

15

that escheats is an interest that represents 2 percent

16

or less of the overall allotment and has earned less

17

than f>100, or in fact under the amended Act

is incapable

18

of earning in the next five years more than

f1CQ.

19

20
21

QUESTION*

Does that suggest that the acreage

in each instance is very small?
MR. KNEEDLER*

Well, the allotments, yes.

22

Well, it depends again how one would define as small.

23

The allotments under the General Allotment Act were

24

typically 160 acres for a head of a family, smaller

25

amounts to others.

Under the Sioux Allotment Act at

2

families, so 2 percent of a

two or three acres.

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLEP.;

16C acre allotment would be

Are these undivided interests?
These are undivided interests.

6

These are not interests that have been partitioned.

7

There are provisions under the regulations fcr partition

8

of Indian allotments in certain circumstances, but the

9

ones we have here are undivided interests.

10

The Court of Appeals held that this escheat

11

provision effects a taking of property in violation of

12

the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution because of the

13

absence of compensation.

14

and that Section 207 is in fact an exercise by Congress

15

cf the traditional power of the sovereign that has been

16

repeatedly recognized by this Court to regulate the

17

devolution of property upon the death of the owner, and

18

beyond that we submit that it represents a reasonable

19

exercise bv Congress of its unique responsibilities on

20

behalf of Indians to prevent a fragmentation policy that

21

has inhibited the economic development of Indian

22

reservations.

23

We submit that it does not,

This problem arose by virtue of previsions in

24

the original allotment Acts, the General Allotment Act

25

having been passed 100 years age, in

1887, and the Sioux

statute in 1889.

2

the allotments and to protect its tax-exempt status»

3

Congress provided for the allotments to be retained in

4

trust status by the United States for 25 years subject

5

to extension for ten years by the President , but because

6

of this period of trust status in the beginning Congress

7

provided for the disposition of the property at death,

8

even in the original Acts, by stating that the property

9

would pass to the allottee's heirs in accordance with

10

the laws of the state where the property is situated.

11

To prevent improvident alienation cf

This had the effect of incorporating the state

12

law of intestate succession into Federal law.

13

1910 Congress enacted a statute that for the first time

14

authorized allottees to dispose of their property by

15

will.

16

Then in

Thereafter the allotment policy was repudiated

17

most profoundly in the Indian Reorganization Act of

18

1934, and for tribes that chose to come under the IRA

19

and the Alla 11a Sioux tribe in this case was one such

20

tribe, the Act had the effect of extending indefinitely

21

the trust period for Indian allotments, and also

22

preventing further allotment of the lands, although

23

Congress did

24

individual who owns an interest in an allotment to apply

25

tc get a fee patent to the land and have it partitioned

enact 25 USC 483, which permits an

(202) 628-9300

or to sell it, so it has not been frozen in trust status
irrevocably.
The heirship previsions, though, had the
effect of causing the breakup or the fractionation of
the interests from generation to generation.

Typically

what happened either under the heirship statute or the
provision for disposition by will is that the original
allottee’s interests was divided among his heirs or
devisees in undivided interests, and then when each of
those heirs or devisees died his interest in turn was
subdivided, sc that over the course of 1QC years, with
each passing generation these interests become further
divided, and
this case.

that is vividly illustrated by the facts of
The interests that escheated by appellee’s

decedents in

this case, in one instance the de minimis

interests would subdivide among seven heirs, that is in
the case of the named appellee here, Irving, thirteen
heirs in the case of appellee Pumpkin Seed.
So, this shews that today if — in the absence
of this statute these interests would continue to
further subdivide.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Kneedler, can I just ask one

question about the authority to dispose of property by
will?

Could an owner of one of these shares or pieces

of real estate will it tc anyone he chose?

But could an owner, for example,

18

give all of his interest to his oldest child, or

19

something like that, in order to try and prevent the

division into very small interests?

21

MR. KNEEDLER;

Yes, he could do that.

And

22

there also are some special statutes on seme

reservations.

statute that was involved in Simmons versus Seletze,

25

which was unanimously affirmed by this Court.

On the Yakima Reservation there was a

That was an instance where the Yakima Trite,

2

there was a special statute to prohibit the passage of

any land to anyone with less than one-quarter Yakima

blood, and in that case because the heirs at law, the

It escheated pursuant to a statute enacted by

10

Congress back in 1942 that provided where an Indian dies

intestate, without heirs, that the property escheats to

13

Congress has chosen that way of disposing of property.

10

superintendents are responsible for particular

reservations, instructions explaining the way this would

by individuals to avoid escheat, and then the

12

Hr. Kneedler, are there any limits

13

in your view as to what the government can dc or change

14

concerning the descent of property belonging to

15

Indians?

16

to really make any kind of a regulation?

17

Do you think the government has plenary power

MR . KNEEDLER:

No, our submission does not go

18

nearly that far.

The Court

has described the power of

19

the legislature over the descent of property in very

20

broad terms, suggesting that the right to pass property

21

and to receive it by descent or by will is creation of

22

statute and net a natural right, it is a privilege that

23

can be conditioned or even abolished, but the Court has

24

never been confronted with a situation where it had to

25

address that, and it isn't here.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, this is — Congress

8

obviously can — I think there is an element of

because the legislatures have typically responded in a

reasonable fashion and a responsible fashion, and it is

without the express permission of the Federal

Government?

15

What can the tribe do with that property

MR. KNEEDLER;

The tribe, just as the

16

individual who owned it, would need the consent of the

17

United States to either sell it or to lease it, so that

18

the property remains restricted whether it is in

individual hands or tribal hands.

5

claims here which are pressed by prospective heirs after

than the heirs themselves.

Therefore the

The taking occurred at the time of

MR. KNEEDLEP ;

Because it could be avoided

between the time of the passage of the Act.

The Act

10

does not affect the right of the owner of the fractional

11

interest to sell it during his lifetime, to give it

12

away, to purchase other interests that would bring his

13

ownership above the 2 percent level to avoid escheat, so

14

the -- it wasn't until the time of escheat -QUESTION;

15
16

Well, you are saying then they do

have standing in their own capacity.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, they are still asserting

18

the rights of the decedent to dispose of the property in

19

the way that he chooses, but their claim is, because the

20

decedent is net alive any longer to assert his interest

21

in doing that that they should be permitted to assert

22

that right on his behalf.
QUESTION;

23

And the government accepts that.

less important element in that setting.

go to the decedent and would not necessarily reach these

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MS. WAR BONNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

3

it please the Court, what I first want to place before

4

the Court today is the significance of these property

interests in terms of the decedents, Charles Pumpkin

When you translate the percentage figures and

Pumpkin Seed, who had nine interests which were subject

15

tc transfer tc the tribe under this Act, these

16

interests, this 2 percent or less interest amounted to

17

one-third of an acre all the way up to, one of his

18

interests was the size of four and a half acres.

Are you saying, then, Ms. War

that.

These are undivided interests, but their share cf

2

the interest was four and a half acres, and if you look

3

at the history of Indian land policy, the reason that

4

these people had undivided interest was net actually

5

interests would pass in an undivided status.

Charles Pumpkin Seed could net go to the John Shot

10

allotment and say this four and a half acres is mine and

11

I have trees and whatever.

12

which translates into four and a half acres of land,

13

which is a significant amount of land, certainly enough

14

land to put a house, certainly enough land to put a

One of the problems of

9

MS. WAR BONNETT;

Right.

Certainly the trite

is the most logical buyer of those types of interests,

11

and it depends upon whether the tribes have the funds to

do it.

that has tc be balanced in determining the situation.

To argue that these people had other remedies I don’t

here which should have been, even if people had notice

I think it would net be

QUESTION!

5

6

?s we have said, we don't —

Well, I know.

It may be late, but

that is the way a lot of these respondent cases are.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

As we say, this is not a

8

situation like Texaco where

notice is an important

9

ingredient, we think, because laws regulating the

10

descent of property typically happen automatically at

11

the moment of death, and the legislature does not

12

normally provide a grace period when it changes the

13

rules of descent, even though they might substantially

14

unsettle the decedent's expectations of where his

15

property was geing to go.
I would like to respond to several points that

16
17

were made.

18

19

not receive these properties without compensation.

20

Well, nothing in this statutory scheme prohibits the

21

tribe from making compensation to individual members if

22

it chooses.

23

One is the filing by the tribe in the court

The tribe wanted or said that these -- it should

Another alternative that is open to the tribe

24

under the 1984 amendments is to pass a statute providing

for an alternative disposition of these interests rather

than having them escheat.

2

have them descend by intestate succession tc other

3

owners of fractional interests in the same parcel, which

4

would prevent the further fragmentation of interest.

5

With respect to Justice Powell's questions

One possibility would be to

about the possible sale of the property tc ethers, there

One is to give it

11

14

than the problems created by the very fractionated

15

against.

17

rise above the 2 percent

One of the principal problems that Congress

18

was responding to was the inability to sell these

19

parcels of land and the fragmentation of ownership and

20

the assembly cf tracts that could be economically used,

21

just as in Lock and in Texaco versus Short.

22

We think for the reasons stated in our opening

23

brief and reply brief that appellees are cuite wrong tc

say that the Sioux Allotment Act had seme unique

25

contractual element that the General Allotment Act,
51

which it really mirrors, did not have.

The language was

2

drawn directly from the General Allotment Act.

3

Gourt in Jefferson versus Fink said that did not create

4

any contractual rights, and there is no evidence from
