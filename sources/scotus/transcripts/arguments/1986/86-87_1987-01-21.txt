This case presents one stark proposition.
is said by the Court of Appeals below that a mere

prediction or concern for dangerousness cannot, consist
with substantive due process, justify detention of an
adult charged with crime.

Now, Chief Judge Feinberg, in his dissent,

proposition?

First of all, no

this Court plainly holds that way.

Respondents, although not the Court of

8

Appeals, argue that the detention here is punitive.

9

Now, there is no doubt that the dentention is

10

incapacitive, and that punitive detention also is.

11

But if all detention were punitive, then the

12

detention of juveniles, of deportable aliens, of persons

13

thought to be associated with the enemy in wartime, of

14

insane persons, would also be punitive.

15

plain that that is not the case.

Now, the Court of

Appeals did not find this to

be a punitive -- a punitive statute or to have a
punitive purpose.

Rather it was found to be regulatory

5

in much the same way as the detention in

Martin was regulatory; in much the same way that the

detention in

Greenwood was regulatory.

That's the question which the Court
we think that is the correct

Now, there's no doubt that the burden here on

the individual is indeed a heavy burden.

16

no doubt, therefore, that the government bears a weighty

17

burden of justifications.

18

And there is

Now, the respondents argue that no

19

justification will work; that no justification is

20

sufficient to permit the detention on account of

21

dangerousness of an adult, competent citizen in time of

22

peace.

23

Now, of course, all this line, which the

24

respondent draws — adult, competent, time of peace,

25

citizen not alien -- what this line represents is a

And it’s not surprising, since this is a new
scheme, and the Court granted ceriorari to decide an

But the principles of this Court,

11

QUESTION;

12

MR.

Wasn't it in the case originally?

FRIED:

I*m not aware that an argument was

13

made on the basis of the Eighth Amendment, and if it

14

were, it would quite properly have been rejected.

15

Because the Eighth Amendment, as we understand, and

16

simply looking at the text of the amendment, says there

17

shall be no unreasonable bail in a case where bail is

18

provided .

19

Here, the statute does not provide for bail,

government would be ready to go to trial right away on

the one hand, or recognize that there's congestion on
the calendar and all sorts of things that might require
prolonged delay?

6

Is that a relevant factor to consider?

7

MR. FRIED;

a number of judges, and

8

serious and respected judges, have certainly thought

that the period of detention, and indeed, the reasons

why the period of detention

12

might be quite long, bear on

And in an appropriate case, which this is net

13

-- because that issue has not been raised -- in an

MR. FRIED:

Those

Courts of Appeals to simply

shift the burden of going

the burden of going forward

In those Courts of

and they have not been treated in that way.

Once again,

I think with a new scheme like

And the danger is not only to the rights of
Mr. Salerno,

the rights of Mr. Cafaro, but to everyone's

righ ts.
Because up until this point, I think I
certainly have lived under the assumption, and have
practised law under the assumption, that you got
punished, you went to jail, only after the government
was able, after trial, after proof of guilt

beyond a

reasonable doubt, to inflict punishment.
And I think that's the starting point,
certainly, of our brief, and the starting point of the
issues now before this Court.
In response to what Justice Marshall brought
up about the Eighth

Amendment,

I submit, Your Honor,

that we didn't drop the ball.

The Eighth Amendment is a very, very vital

2

part of our argument in this case.

3

that right is encompassed within every defendant's due

4

It's a vital part as

process rights, substantive due process rights.

5

they don't just deal with one simple right versus

that the Eighth Amendment must mean something.

Because

in the substantive due process

and a very large part of it, is,

As this Court has

pointed out in prior

decisions, particularly Stack v. Boyle, where you found

11

-- and the language used there I don't believe can be

12

termed mere dicta -- but the language speaks of the

13

right to bail in certain circumstances.

14

To

be sure, our argument is not that there is

15

a right to bail in each and

16

certainly historical reasons, and valid ancillary

17

reasons,

the risk to society is not that there's going to be

there will be a crime committed by this individual,

22

only where the threat to the system is that he will not

23

reappear, subject himself to the jurisdiction of the

24

court, or where the actions, as we point out in our

25

For there is

to the criminal justice system to deny bail in

again, if Stack v. Boyle is

QUESTION;

Well, do you think that dissents in

Carlson v. Landon ought to mean more than the Court
opinion ?
MR. CARDINALE:

No.

And I say that only

because of the very particular facts that the Court
addressed in

Carlson v. Landon, facts, as we point out,

and as General Fried must agree, facts that

are very

dispositive in their distinction with the facts before
the Court and the issue before the Court.
In Carlson v. Landon, it wasn’t a -- it was
not a criminal proceeding.

And the Court, very easily,

in those circumstances, I submit, perhaps too easily -but that’s my personal view as opposed to what the
jurisprudence shows -- said

that the Eighth

Amendment in

these circumstances, and bail, simply doesn’t apply.
In

conjunction with that, we had a very, very
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

strong right that the Court recognized in Carlson v.

2

Landon that the executive branch has to keep out of our

3
4
5
6

country, whether by expulsion or refusal to enter,
aliens; in that case, those that were deemed to be
dangerous.
So those are the types of dispositive

7

differences that I think are made up in each one of the

8

examples that we have brought to this Court's attention

9
10
11

that have, in the past, allowed for preventive
detention, as it were.
And they do not exist in this case.

Schall v.

Martin, we point out,

17

without which, I submit, this Court would net have come

18

to the conclusion it did.

19

I believe very aptly, is like the

safety of the

necessary dual purpose

And that dual purpose being that there was a

20

subject of that preventive detention who was not clearly

21

free of detentive aspects in general; it was always, as

22

the Court has pointed out, juveniles always in some form

23

of custody.

But it h3S never, and this Court has never

any way, shape, or form

citizens.
Now, General Fried makes a very big
distinction,

saying

that, well, the respondents can’t

simply carve out a niche, a new class, that has
heretofore never existed.
I somewhat agree with that analysis, but I
submit to the Court that what we are talking about here
is not a class that is being carved out;

but we’re

talking about 99.999 percent of the population, and
people about whom this Court has never had to step over
the line and address the issues that this case brings
before the Court.
You've never had to do that when you were

2

And there is no effort to gerrymander, as the

3

court puts it, the prior jurisprudence of this Court in

there is no need to make such distinctions.

society -- but in addition to that, we have a situation
where as in Stack v. Boyle,

out, the right to bail in these circumstances is
necessary to enable someone

to fairly meet the

challenge.

QUESTION!

Mr. Cardinale, is it any different,

in punishment terms, from the examples that you say are
permissible?

Say there was proof that the defendant had

threatened the life of, or was about to try and kill a
witness?

Would that not also be punishment?
MR. CARDINALE:

No, not -- it is ancillary, I

submit, and the Court must make this distinction, it is
ancillary to

the justice system to protect its ability

to function normally! just,

for example, why it would be

okay for a very preliminary detention of an individual
to get the jurisdiction to attach, just as it would be
ancillary to the justice system to stop somebody from

And similarly, that is something that is

punishment here, this pretrial detention, is ancillary

you with that, you’re now violated,

if he's done

sufficient actions toward that end.
And again, we have actions instead of
prediction.

And I think that that’s where the fatal

flaw in this whole statutory -QUESTION;

Mr. Cardinale,

isn’t it possible

that the reason for the difference in the two cases, one
person who’s

going to kill a witness and

one not, the

reason for the differing treatment is not any inherent
greater sanctity for the judicial process, but just
simply because as common lav courts,

courts had the

power and the authority to protect their own processes?
They weren’t given any right to protect the
society at large.
NR. CARDINALE;
QUESTION:

Certainly.

But now there is a statute from the

body which does have the authority to protect the
society at large, the

Congress, which says,

do the same

thing for the society at large that you’ve been doing
under your inherent judicial authority to protect your
own processes.

to look at this, while the government's

not, whether because the ultimate

without parole, or the death penalty, that because that
would give somebody

a very,

very good reason to leave

fair inference, when, again, the evidence is strong and
the presumption great, as the old language went,

to

MR. CARDINALE;

17

No, because there was no

evidence -- and the government conceded that -- there
was no evidence, despite everything and the enormity of
the charges,

even though they didn't include death

penalties, they certainly added

up to an excess of 300

years, the government submitted in that circumstance
that they were not flight risks; they were not at all
concerned that these people

wouldn't come back when

their time came to appear, and go through trial,

and be

sentenced, if necessary.

15
16

Would that make the

pretrial detention in this very case permissible?

with respect to the crimes

I think, again, if I could, with the short
period of time I've got left, I really think we need to
address -- I

would like to address -- the issue that if

we get by the substantive due process challenges we
make, when you assess the validity of the statute, you
must look at

what -- and you assess also whether or not

this predictive behavior is

ever a proper basis,

who are charged in Federal courts nowadays?

Don't we just look at what happened

MR. CARDINALE;

So, I think that the challenge

that we're making -- and I will get to the exat facts in
this case, because I think they do shed seme light on
this whole area -- but when

we are challenging,

5

facially, the constitutionality of this statute,

includes whether or not they were applied properly.

In

this case, the

fact that the procedures

to maintain the constitutionality on a due process basis

of this statute.
