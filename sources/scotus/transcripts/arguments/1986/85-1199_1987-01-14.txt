ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

BERGER:

BERGER,

ESQ.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Last term in

9

MacDonald, Sommer £ Frates versus

10

County

of Yolo, this Court found itself unable to reach

11

the question of whether the just compensation guarantee

12

is invoked when a local government regulation takes the

13

use of private property, and

14

each that question because the California

15

Appeals had based

16

independent grounds:

it found itself unable to
Court of

its decision on two separate

One, that no taking had been properly alleged

17
18

in the complaint;

and

two, that even if one had been

19

properly alleged in the complaint,

20

forbade

just compensation as

that California law

a remedy.

This Court thus
9

21

concluded that, since it could find that the independent

22

holding that there was not a

23

taking was sufficient to justify the decision, it need

24

not reach

25

the

proper allegation of

a

compensation issue.

This case is different.

Here the California

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Court of Appeals dealt with only one issue, and it

2

reached its conclusion for only one reason.

' 3
4

And since

that takes only one sentence, I’d like to reread it to
the Court i

5

"We conclude that because the United States

6

Supreme Court

7

whether a state may constitutionally limit the remedy

8

for a taking to Don-monetary relief, this court is

9

obligated to fellow Agins."

has not yet ruled on the question of

Of course, the Agins opinion which the Court

10
11

of Appeals was referring to was the 1979 decision of the

12

California Supreme Court which concluded that monetary

13

damages in the form of just compensation are not

14

available for a regulation which takes the use of

15

property.

16

Thus, adhering to the respect which this Court

17

in MacDonald said must be paid to the decisions of the

18

California Court of Appeals on matter of local law and

19

local pleading, we would submit that the compensation

20

issue which the Court was unable to reach in MacDonald

21

is squarely before the Court in this case, because it’s

22

the only question of a federal nature that the

23

California Court of Appeals dealt with and it’s the only

24

issue that was litigated on this question in

25

California courts.

QUESTION;

And you say you raised a federal

2

constitutional claim of this sort in the California

3

Court of Appeals?

4

SR. BERGER i

Yes, sir.

And that’s the issue

5

that the California Court of Appeals dealt with.

They

6

clearly analyzed the decision of the California Supreme

7

Court in Agins in light of what had harpened in this

8

Court in its decisions since Agins, primarily the San

9

Diego Gas L Electric opinions, and concluded that this

10

Court had not yet clearly enough indicated what its

11

feelings were for California to reach a different

12

conclusion, and therefore it found itself bound by the

13

California —

14

QUESTION:

For it,

at any rate, to reach a

15

different conclusion than the Supreme Court of

16

California had reached.

17

SR.

BERGER:

Well, that's true, and for any

18

California court to reach a different conclusion.

19

the reply brief, for example, we've collected all of

20

post-Agins California decisions.

21

Court twice since Agins has reiterated the rule that

22

regulations cannot lead to just compensation .

23

In

The California Supreme

The California Court of Appeals in a dozen or

24

more cases in varying contexts has held that damages

25

under just compensation cannot be awarded for a
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

regulatory taking of property, and they've held that

2

even in cases which were expressly brought as federal

3

civil rights cases under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 in state

4

courts.
QUESTION;

5

In California, I take it they say

6

that you can get a declaration of invalidity and an

7

injunction ?
HR.

8
9

BERGER;

courts say.

10

QUESTION;

11

HR. BERGER;

12

That is what the California

And an injunction?
Well, that I suppose would go

along with the declaration of invalidity.
QUESTION;

13

Well, in any event, what’s really

14

left over is whether you can

15

taking.

16
17

HR. BERGER;

get damages for a temporary

If you get a declaration of

invalidity, what’s left is compensation for the other
i

18
19

period of time, that’s correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

And saying that you can’t get

20

damages for a temporary taking is a federal

21

constitutional issue?

22

MR.

23

QUESTION;

24
25

BERGER:

Yes, sir.
And just like whether there was a

taking in the first place.
HR. BERGER;

It’s a question of degree and of

degree only.

QUESTION;

MR.

Well, I know.

BERGER;

Nobody challenged that.
I know,

BERGER;

I know.

And the courts only dealt with

the question of whether the remedy --

MR.

QUESTION;

14

In this case the complaint

alleged there was a taking.

6

10

Well, you don’t reach the remedy

That’s right.

BERGER;

— was just compensation.
But there were two constitutional

questions and they just, they decided one of them.

15

MR. BERGER;

16

QUESTION;

No, they assumed one of them.
Well, all right.

They decided one

17

of them, if there was a taking you had no remedy for

18

damages .

19

20

MR.

BERGER;

But they assumed that the

pleading under local law --

21

QUESTION;

22

MR.

Well, I know.

BERGER;

— adequately alleged a taking.

23

And having adequately alleged a taking, what the County

24

said was, those allegations are immaterial.

25

QUESTION;

All I’m trying to get at is that we

needn’t worry that there was no decision below that

2

there was a taking.

3

MR.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BERGER:

6

BERGER;

I agree with Your Honor that -That's all I’m trying --- you need not be concerned

because the court below held it to be immaterial.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR.

9

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Berger --

BERGER:

Yes, sir.
-- it seems to me there might be

10

two different sorts of taking, and I’m just curious as

11

to what your allegation.

12

this regulation remains in place and it prevents us from

13

building again in this area, that would constitute a

14

taking for which we’re entitled.

One, you might allege that if

You might additionally allege that, even if

15
16

the regulation is voided by a declaratory judgment after

17

three and a half years of litigation, that the three and

18

a half years of litigation, inability to build for three

19

and a half years, is a separate taking, for which in all

20

events we’re entitled to compensation.
Do you make the second allegation in your

21
22
23
24
25

complaint ?
MR. BERGER:

I believe we do, Your Honor.

make the allegation that -QUESTION:

That even if the regulation is

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We

1

voided, that the temporary deprivation of use would have

2

been so serious that it amounts to a taking of your

3

property?
MR. BERGER:

4

The detailed allegations are not

5

that express in the complaint.

6

alleges is that the ordinance which was adopted -QUESTION:

7

What the complaint

I understand, that that's the

8

taking and if it remains in place it's a taking.

9

it perfectly clear that you've alleged that the period

10

of time that it takes to get your rights vindicated in

11

court is also sufficient to amount to a taking?
MR.

12
13

QUESTION:

MR. BERGER:

It was never questioned in the

courts below.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR.

20

You think it’s implicit in all

allegations of taking?

16
17

It seems to me that’s implicit in

the complaint. Your Honor.

14
15

BERGER:

But is

All allegations of taking?

BERGER:

I believe it is, and as nobody

ever questioned it -QUESTION:

21

It certainly is at least

22

theoretically possible that the temporary deprivation

23

would not be serious enough to cross the constitutional

24

threshold?

25

it’s a taking when it’s permanent, a fortiori it’s also

Or do you think that that’s impossible?

this Court in

it*s bigger than a breadbox.

7

Loretto, taking doesn’t depend on whether

QUESTION:

That’s a physical occupation.

We’re talking about regulatory takings here.
MR.

BERGER:

I understand that that was a

8

physical occupation rather than a regulatory taking.

9

And you know,

whether we’re in fact able tc prove that

10

this was a taking, that it crossed the threshold, is an

11

issue that we haven't reached in this case yet, because

12

the California court dismissed the case.

13

And it may be that when we go back

to trial

14

the evidence won’t show a taking, or the evidence

15

wouldn’t have shown a significant diminution in the

16

value of the property.

17
18

QUESTION;

But you’re out of court now, you’re

out of court now.

19

MR.

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. BERGER;

22
23
24
25

BERGER;

But that’s a matter of fact.
You’re out of court.
The allegations are that the

regulation did in fact take the use of property.
QUESTION;

And you had no chance to prove it

because you’re out of court for another reason.
MR. BERGER;

At this point, yes.
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

2

And do California rules allow

notice pleading, the way the federal rules do?
MR. BERGER;

3

Technically, it*s called fact

4

pleading, but the facts that are required to be pled in

5

the complaint are equivalent to federal notice

6

pleading.

7

facts are required to be pled in the complaint, ultimate

8

facts the California court calls them, rather than

9

evidentiary facts.

10

They are very -- only the basic fundamental

And it’s clear as a matter of the record in

11

this case that the County certainly understood what

12

those minimal alegations meant, because they immediately

13

responded by moving to strike them on the ground that

14

under the Agins case there could be no recovery of

15

compensation for a taking by a regulation.

16

QUESTION;

May I ask you about the discussion

17

of temporary taking.

18

books, you have a taking, don’t you?

19
20

21

MR.

As long as the ordinance is on the

BERGER;

Yes, Your Honor.

As long as the

ordinance is there, it takes the use of property.
QUESTION;

So as of today, the argument in

22

this case, are we to consider it as a temporary or a

23

permanent taking?

24
25

MR. BERGER;

Well, this temporary taking is

now nine years old, and I strongly suspect from an
1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

economist’s standpoint that if you have taken something

2

for that long you’ve taken it permanently.

3

QUESTION:

If we leave the ordinance in

4

effect, it’ll be a permanent

5

is that correct?

6

MR.

7

QUESTION:

BERGER:

taking so far as we know,

Yes, that’s correct.
Well now, the case was litigated,

8

though,

was it not, under some temporary ordinance, as

9

opposed to the one now in effect?
MR. BERGER:

10

The case was originally filed

11

under what they called a temporary ordinance, yes,

12

ma ’am .
QUESTION:

13

And you assert for our purposes

14

here that that admittedly temporary ordinance is a

15

permanent taking?
MR.

16

BERGER:

That temporary ordinance was in

17

effect for three years, of course, before they replaced

18

it.'

19

so-called, is the same as the temporary ordinance, if

20

allowed --

21
22
23

The general effect of the permanent ordinance,

QUESTION:

But we are looking at it from the

standpoint of that original temporary ordinance.
MR.

BERGER:

I think-what this case involves

24

is not the so-called temporary ordinance or the

25

so-called permanent ordinance, but the County’s pattern
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

of regulation of this particular piece of land.

2

started out with their moratorium, their temporary

3

ordinance so that they could study what use they wanted

made on this land, and they consistently followed it

5

through.

Well, that*s the record we have in

front of us.

The things that have happened since are

MR. EERGER;

9

It

That's correct.

If remanded,

10

that of course would become of interest to both parties,

11

what has happened since, because the temporary

12

ordinance, the original ordinance, of course, flatly

13

prohibits any use on the property and doesn't allow the

14

County to make the arguments that it does —
QUESTION;

15

Well, under your theory would a

16

municipality or county that made it temporarily

17

impossible to build on something because of road repair

18

or something of that kind have made a taking

19

requires compensation for that interim period?

20

MR.

EERGER;

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. EERGER;

then that

No, not necessarily. Your Honor.
But possibly?
It would depend on what the facts

23

shoved.

In this case we're not, for example, talking

24

about a temporary road repair that requires a minor

25

detour that may have disrupted the use for a short

BERGER:

Yes, ma'am.

The highway people

routinely condemn temporary easements so that they can

17

perform just that kind of construction without having to

18

litigate with people over inverse compensation cases.

19

They acknowledge that they are taking their access and

20

interfering with their use, and they directly go ahead

and buy that interest.

QUESTION:

But supposing they didn't — I

think Justice O'Connor's question was supposing they

didn't go through the compensation procedure, they just

of that parcel of land entitled in California to

in that fashion.

BERGER:

If the property in fact — if the

believe that is a taking, and the taking would require a

trial on what just compensation is due for that period

of time .

BERGER;

I think it’s potential, it’s

possible that there may be some cases where there in

13

there was no use being made or going to be made during

they didn't allege anything but that it denies all use,

Beyond that,

however, as the Court recognized in Agins and in
MacDonald, the Court can take judicial notice of the
actual provisions of the ordinance.

compared the actual provisions of the ordinance with the

the Court looks at these ordinances — and by "these

Under Mugler versus Kansas, a government has

the right to prohibit a dangerous use of land.

the Court said 100 years ago in that case is that that

is not a taking, it's not the kind of regulation for

Mugler versus Kansas has been reiterated in

a recently as this Court’s opinion in the Penn Central

key point, and that is that when you’re dealing with a

regulation aimed at protecting the health and safety of

the citizens ycu’re dealing with a different animal.

15

What you have there is an exception to the

normal rule that a regulation which destroys property

values can be regarded as a taking, because if all the

MR. WHITE:

1

Well, the bottom line is this.

2

The bottom line is suppose -- and I think that is what

3

we can assume is the case here -- suppose a regulation

4

in fact denies all use.

5

if the Court wants to accept that as a general

6

proposition, that it’s bound by that conclusory

7

allegation and this one in fact denies all use.
The County’s position is that use is

8
9

Now, we don’t concede that, but

dangerous, and the fact that a Mugler type regulation

1Q

which prevents a dangerous use of land happens to

11

deprive the property owner of all of his use does not

12

provide an exception to the Mugler rule that

13

compensation doesn’t have to be paid.
The bottom line question is does the County

14
15

have to make a choice between allowing a dangerous use

16

of land to be resumed or buy the land by paying

17

compensation, because the only way to prevent a

18

dangerous use of this land would be to put a permanent

19

restriction.

i

Then we’ve got a total taking, a permanent

20
21

taking.

Does the County have to do that?

Is that the

22

County’s choice, allow them tc make a dangerous use of

the land or buy them out, particularly in a situation

Well, it would be a taking for

which compensation would be required if the zoning

10

regulation remained permanent.

Now, if the property

11

owner challenged the zoning ordinance under the

12

California rule and it was declared to be invalid

13

because it goes too far under Pennsylvania Coal versus

14

McMahon -- or Mahon -- then you'd have the question

15

whether it was a taking during the temporary period.

My position on that is no, it's not a
temporary taking.

The reason construction in flood plains is

12

being restricted is that it's dangerous.

13

because it raises the flood level.

14

because it causes a surge of water downstream, and when

15

the building breaks up, as these buildings did — what

more proof do we need than the actual events of this

the merits, do you want to say a few words about why we

2

shouldn't imply a monetary cause of action?

3

MR. WHITE;

Yes, Justice Scalia, I

will.

I

4

think what you have under the California rule is a

5

situation where the California Supreme Court said that

6

it interferes with the legislative prerogative for the

7

court to order it in essence to exercise its power of

8

eminent domain.

And declaring that the regulation is invalid

10

satisfies the requirements of the Fifth Amendment

11

because it removes the offending regulation.

essence, the permanence has been lifted.

In

that's correct.

QUESTION:

18

MR.

SHITE:

Now, why shouldn't we imply —
Because the interim period is

19

nothing more than a delay inherent in the regulatory

20

process.

It's no different than delays on trying to get

21

permits.

It's no different than a whole host of delays

22

that are caused by various kinds of building and safety

QUESTION;

I’ve seen references to

--

Well, the Agins come pretty close,

don’t they?
MR. WHITE;

Well, the Agins, I don’t know what

happened after the Agins decision was decided.

But this

Court held that there was no taking in the Agins case.
But my point is I don’t think a rule of

12

general application should be adopted cn the assumption

13

that some regulatory agencies may be acting in bad faith

14

when other regulatory agencies, like the County of Los

15

Angeles, which adopted a regulation that it thought was

16

in compliance with the national flood insurance program

17

— why should the County be penalized with a rule that's

18

based in part cn a policy that assumes there’s going to

19

be gamesmanship when it didn’t engage in any

20

gamesmanship ?

21

So if there’s going to be compensation for a

22

temporary harm because a regulation has gone too far, I

23

would draw a line at the situation where there is some

24

kind of showing of bad faith

25

the part of the zoning authorities to go beyond what is

or intentional conduct on

Here we have a situation where there was no

way on God's earth that the County of Los Angeles could

have known when it adopted what it thought was a badly

5

needed safety regulation in accordance with the federal

6

regulations that it was going to have to pay some

7

compensation for it because it had crossed over that

8

line.
So I would draw the line for compensation for

9
10

temporary harms where there is some kind of intent or

bad faith.

12

that there should be any compensation.
