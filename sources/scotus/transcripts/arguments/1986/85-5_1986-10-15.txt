ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR.

WALDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court!
In this case, the lever court applied a

10

substantial contingency multiplier to an hourly rate it

11

held to be high, for lawyers the Circuit Court of

12

Appeals found

13

this case for reargument on the issue of whether a

14

presumptively reasonable lodestar fee may ever be sc

15

enhanced for risk of loss and, if so, to what extent.

16

to be inexperienced.

This Court certified

We submit that in the instant case tc do sc is

17

clearly inappropriate, where the defendant at all

18

material times tore the substantial burden of proof and

19

where there was no specific finding that the lodestar

20

fee was not adequate to fully compensate counsel as to

21

all factors.

22

Further, we submit to you that the concert of

23

contingency multiplication is fundamentially

24

inappropriate for at least three reasons.

25

that it is inconsistent with the rationale of Blum, that

We submit

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it compensates counsel for unsuccessful cases and

2

claims, contrary to the intent of Congress as enshrined

3

by this Court in Hensley and Puckelshaus,

4

not necessary, and indeed so unnecessary tc effectuate

5

the purpose of Congress in attracting competent counsel

6

tc federal rights cases that it can only invite marginal

7

litigation and produce windfall fees, as in fact it did

8

in the instant case.

and that it is

The rationale for this practice as it has been

9
10

applied since it has evolved over the past dozen years

11

in most of our circuits is so irrationale that, frankly,

12

it has been recast in

13

argumen t.

14

this case since the last

Courts were required after the fact to

15

determine how unlikely it was they would reach the

16

result they in fact reached.

17

to protect his client from substantial fees, was forced,

18

to argue that he really never had much of a case to

19

start with.

20

Defense counsel, in order

We were penalizing the best defenses.

It is so irrational that counsel has attempted

21

to recast the risk of less on reargument as the risk of

22

non-payment and-or as the risk of losing a case not

23

because of the strength or weakness of the merits, but

24

because of the tenacity of the defense.

25

We submit to you that in a fee-shifting

context the risk of receiving no payment is the risk of

2

losing the case.

3

case, if it is anything, is a case which counsel is

4

likely to win, with adequate preparation and

5

presentation and with due diligence and perseverance.

6

We submit tc you that a meritorious

Indeed, the extent to which plaintiff's

7

counsel is confronted with a tenacious defense and

8

protracted litigation is ipso facto the extent to which

9

his houro go up, and these are fully compensated within

10
11

the lodestar calculation.
To enhance that fee further violates the

12

fundamental rationale of the Elum case.

13

to you that if it is inappropriate, as this Court held

14

in Hensley, to provide any compensation whatsoever tc an

15

attorney for claims he lost in a case where he has

16

partially prevailed, how can it possibly be reasonable

17

to enlarge fees on claims on

18

proportionate to how likely it was in retrospect that he

19

would or could have lost them?

20

We also submit

which he did prevail

This makes no sense.

Furthermore, I think that it's highly

21

significant that the ABA, the amicus in this case,

22

recognizes that at least as tc lawyers who represent

23

some winning cases -- or clients, excuse me, in some

24

winning cases and in some losing cases, this practice

25

clearly provides compensation for work performed on

(202) 628-9300

2

unsuccessful claims
They go on to arbitrarily characterize that

3

class of lawyers as small, citing no evidence.

I submit

4

to Your Honors that all of the lawyers I know have wen

5

some cases and lost some cases, and I would submit tc

6

you that the class of lawyers who win some cases and

7

lose some cases is in fact very large.

8

Also, the 12 small firms who came in as amicus

9

acknowledged throughout their statement of interest that

10

they depend on contingency multiplication to sustain

11

them in terms of law firm economics, because there is

12

work they take that they are not compensated for.

13

Indeed, even circuits which have permitted

14

contingency multiplication up to now, like the Eighth,

15

have recognized, in Ridenour versus Montgomery Ward,

16

that providing contingency enhancement does in fact

17

provide same compensation to lawyers for werk they have,

18

done on unsuccessful claims.

19

Finally, we submit that all Congress intended

20

when it adopted fee-shifting is to create an adequate

21

inducement to attract competent counsel to important

22

federal rights cases.

23

replicate the private marketplace.

Honors, that Congress has

7

given us some indication of what it contemplates bv a

reasonable fee when less than four years ago they passed

9

the Equal Access to Justice Act and provided that

10

attorneys could get reasonable compensation under a

11

threshold more difficult to meet, incidentally, than the

12

cne in the Clean Air Act case, and capped -- capped --

13

that compensation at $75 an hour.
And I submit to you that the fact that fee

14
15

applicants for that $75 an hour increased

16

almost doubled, from 1984 to

17

we have plenty of competent lawyers who are willing to ,

regular hourly rate when he's sure he’s going to get

paid is $100 an hour, if a client comes to him and he

says, I'm not sure we're going to win this case or net,

7

would it be reasonable for him to say that, if we lose I

ether ?
MR. WALDMANt

I’m suggesting, Your Honor, that

3

when a lawyer negotiates a fee with a private client he

4

is free to not multiply, but enhance his normal hourly

5

rate if that’s what the client agrees to, for a whole

6

variety of factors, including those this Court has

7

absolutely rejected in Blum under the fee-shifting

8

environment.

9

QUESTION!

Well, but specifically for the risk

10

of non-payment, would you say that vas an appropriate

11

thing to do, to adjust to the market problem of not

12

getting paid in the case?

13

MR.

WALDMAN;

It might be, Justice Stevens.

14

And I submit to you that in the fee-shifting environment

15

the. whole concept of enhancement for risk cf loss is

16

inappropriate, where Congress designed --

happen in a free market?
MR.

WALDMANi

that we want to duplicate, to the extent we might, what

21

happens in the free market, is not because that in and

it’s necessary to induce competent counsel to take

And

I submit to you that when we have almost

700,000 practicing lawyers, as Justice Powell noted in

Santos-Rivera , and when there is absolutely nc evidence

4

that all of them are occupied 100 percent of the time

with clients who promptly pay 100 cents on the dollar,

6

in cases that are strong and winnable , there is no need

to provide the maximum possible enhancement --

8

QUESTION;

9

MR.

10
11

Well, no, I’m not suggesting that.

WALD MAN;

— in order to get these

attorneys -QUESTION;

But your argument is that we should

12

not use a market test for this purpose, but rather a

13

test of whether you really need any enhancement to get a

14

lawyer to take the case.

15

MR. WALDMAN;

Yes,

I believe. Your Honor, we

16

should effectuate the purpose of Congress, which was tc

17

provide an adequate incentive to attract competent

18

counsel tc federal rights cases.

19

that the whole history, particularly of the $75 an hour

20

fee experience, is that in order to do so we don’t

21

necessarily have to replicate the highest possible rate

22

that a private lawyer might get -from a consenting client

23

in the private marketplace.

24
25

QUESTION;

And I submit to you

On the other hand, the rate might

be higher than it would be for just the ordinary case,

mightn’t it?

2

MR.

WALDMAN;

3

QUESTION;

I'm sorry. Justice O’Connor?

The market might establish that a

4

higher rate is appropriate in a given class cf case than

5

the ordinary rate that the lawyer would normally charge

6

when sure of payment.
MR.KALDMAN;

7

It might, Justice C’Ccnnor.

8

cf course, Congress hasn’t limited lawyers in the

9

private sector, for example,

10

with these caps such as the

$75 cap.
But I submit to you that private contingent

11
12

practitioners can often take a case that results is

13

lower compensation than the ledestar provides.

14

agree to take a case for --

15

QUESTION;

16

MR.

You can

Yes, like you lose.

KALDMAN;

Well, or you could win, but you

17

can spend two weeks in court to get a verdict cf

18

$40,000.

19

Eut

So I submit to you that the lodestar which

20

provides compensation for every hour reasonably expended

21

times in our case a high fee, at least one determined by

22

the court to be high -- and I submit it was high for a

23

lawyer one and a half years out of law school -- is more

24

than adequate inducement.

Clearly not in this case, where the

issue was never raised or preserved, never asked for,
and where no multiplier was used on the old phases, and
where -- and secondly, where

it’s permissible, I would

say that it is only permissible by awarding the then
normal prevailing interest rate, an objective criterion,
easily reviewable.

WALDMANs

QUESTION:

-I hope yes, Your Hcncr.

What about, does the lodestar

include any element to take account of the fact that
here we are only compensating .winning lawyers?

What I

mean is, you may have an hourly rate in a market, but in
fact a firm that wins a big case is likely either to
bill more hours than it would in a losing case or
perhaps to bill at a somewhat higher rate because of a
big victory.
What you 're compensating for under these
schemes is only winning cases.

Is it fair tc use in the

lodestar an hourly amount that Is the hourly average of
winning and losing cases?

10

Yes, but Congress did not intend

that losing defendants under fee-shifting statutes be

12

made to make up that loss, particularly on a factor as

13

tenuous as how good their defense was and how risky the

case was for the plaintiff.

1

We think. it*s significant in the context of

2

this case to note that compensation for bearing a risk

3

of failure is something different than compensation for

4

the performance of a legal service.

5

litigation in

6

clients, and it's conceivable that it could be done by

7

other people who are neither lawyers nor clients.

The underwriting of

most instances in this country is dene by

8

And we think that the question that this fact

9

poses here is the question of whether lawyers are to be

10

treated differently than clients with regard to the

11

reimbursement for the bearing of this risk of failure.

12

The American Bar Association at page 20 of its

13

brief indicates that when a client has a fixed fee there

14

is then no occasion for compensation for the bearing cf

15

risk, the risk that the client bears in that situation.

16

A number cf appellate court cases agree with that

17

proposition.

18

And: we take that as the jumping off point for

19

the argument that there ought to be a very good reason

20

for awarding compensation to a lawyer for perfermino a

21

function that a client or some other person who is net a

22

lawyer would not be paid for performing.

23

We take that indication from what we know;

24

number one, that the fee-shifting statutes are not

25

intended to be relief acts for lawyers, thus suggesting
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that a special privilege or a special form of

2

compensation for them, not proper for somecne else to

3

receive, probatly isn’t proper.

4

proper to single out lawyers

5

That is, it isn't

for that compensation.

We also know from the prevailing party

6

limitation of the fee-shifting statutes that the whcle

7

idea of compensating for risk of failure, for the risk

8

of not prevailing, is in essenc nothing other than an

9

effort to approximate compensation for not prevailing.

10

That is, the whole idea of risk is how often will the

11

failure occur and how do you compensate for it.

12

For reasons which have largely been stated by

13

Mr. Waldman, we do not believe that the underlying

14

purpose of the fee-shifting statutes, that is to provide

15

effective access to the judicial system, requires this

16

shifting of the burden, this risk cf failure, in the

17

case of lawyers.

18

And

I'd like to mention a few points that he

19

did not mention.

I think the argument of the

20

Respondents relies upon an economic hypothesis which

21

turns out in reality not tc be true.

22

that lawyers are working full-time at some imagined

23

fairly high market rate, and thus to pry them loose from

24

that work it's necessary to compensate them at something

25

higher than that market rate if they are going to be

It’s a hypothesis

The reality is, I think, that when we settle

3

on a market rate the courts dc the best they can to

reality it is an estimate and it is not a figure that

6

accurately reflects anything like what all competent

7

lawyers are working at.

8

Indeed, attorneys who bill at say $100 an hour

9

or $150 an hour do a substantial amount of work at rates

10

that are less than that, and in some instances may net

11

be fully employed at any rate.

market rate which is sort of arbitrarily settled upon,

you’re looking at the question of whether adequate

access to the court system does exist under a given form

of fee-shifting.

22

And

I think it is a reality when

that is the fact that there are a

23

substantial number of attorneys who do fee-shifting type

24

work as a part cf their practice, or indeed who do it in

25

the form cf a legal services practice, where the

monetary compensation, indeed, it’s not irrelevant, but

2

it's not a primary consideration.

3

reasonable to suppose that some decisions will be made

4

not based upon, primarily at least not based upon, the

5

economics of the law practice itself.

6

And thus it is

We also, apart from the issue of the economic

7

compensation that’s required

in order to assure

8

effective assistance of counsel in these cases, we also

9

feel that this fee-shifting specially provided for for

10

lawyers is not required under any reading cf the

11

legislative history of the fee-shifting statutes.

12

the legislative history that is most commonly cited, as

13

indeed the only legislative history readily available,

14

is the legislative history under Section 1S88.

15

And

And the argument was made by Respondent in

16

their brief and has been made elsewhere that those cases

17

cited in the legislative history in 1988 in some sense

18

adopt or accept a notion of fee-shifting.

19

to just address that for a second.

20

And I’d like

Number one, there are four cases cited in that

21

legislative history and only one of them, the Zircher

22

case, involves any contingency component, any

23

enhancement for contingency of failure.

necessary in order to compensate for unsuccessful cases,

and that of course is reasoning that has been rejected

2

by this Court and it is clear, I think, clearly

3

incorrect under the prevailing party limitation.

4

The fact that the other three cases do no

invoke that form of reasoning, do not allow an

enhancement for contingency,

the contrary tc the argument that is being made.

MR.

CRAWFORD;

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
There are two questions which I would like to

21

address briefly.

This being the last case on the last

22

day of the session, I'll try to be as brief as I can.

23

The first question is why is a contingency enhancement

24

appropriate, and the second is what are the flaws in

25

Respondents* arguments against that enhancement.

I also suggest that, on the delay factor, that

him about the propriety of an award for delay were it

make up a contingency payment are appropriate.

what you say is right, why wouldn't it have teen a lot

18

MR. CRAWFORD:

intention was just one thing, to develop a fee structure

21

which would reward winning counsel enough that they

would take this kind of case.

QUESTION:

9

Well then, you wouldn't say -- if

10

it were perfectly clear around that there was no real

11

problem about these kinds of plaintiffs getting lawyers,

12

would you still say that enhancement is perfectly

13

proper?

14

MR. CRAWFORD:

I think enhancement's perfectly

15

proper, but because it's clear that Congress considered

16

among the factors, the Johnson factors, twelve of them,

17

including the contingent quality of compensation.

20

But of course, we've already

the Johnson factors, haven't we?
CRAWFORD:

Because you found double

21

counting, and no one I think reasonably suggests there

22

is double counting on a contingency factor.

23

I suggest, to take it quickly, why else it is

24

appropriate for contingency enhancement, the AEA picked

25

up contingency as a factor for fees in 1908.
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It still

1

takes that as an appropriate factor in its brief in this

2

case.

3

between, it has never departed from that view.

4

In its history through the entire period in

Congress considered in the legislative history

5

contingency as one of the factors.

The Courts of

6

Appeals have universally before Blum and virtually

7

universally after Blum said contingency is an

8

appropriate factor.

9

The Seventh Circuit has waffled some, although

10

certainly when Judge Posner or Judge Esterbrcok sit they

11

come down strongly in favor of contingency .

12

recently in the Lattimore case, with only one active

13

judge participating, they required extraordinary

14

evidence or extraordinary situations for contingency.

15

The D.C. Circuit has waffled.

16

Most

Beyond those two circuits, it’s pretty clear

17

that the Courts of Appeals think that the legislative

18

history is strong.

19

They think it despite Blum.

I also suggest, just before I go on to answer

20

an argument, that this is the right case.

The

21

suggestion is that somehow contingency should not be

22

rewarded against someone who vigorously maintains a

23

meritorious defense.

24

the Government, the Solicitor General agrees, this case

25

by their standards is one we couldn’t have lest, and the

The Commonwealth’s briefs agree,

vigorous defense was not because there was merit, but

2

because there was an intention to stop the carrying cut

3

of a consent decree.

4

'We'weren't in quite as good shape as it leeks,

5

not because there was merit on the other side, but for

6

instance, the supremacy clause, which Judge Becker said

7

was our great defense, is no defense when the United

8

States Government is on the side of the Commonwealth of

9

Pennsylvania.

10

And the first delay, phase four, where the

11

first multiplier came in, is a delay advised and

12

requested by the Federal Government, and eventually cnly

13

Delaware Valley persuaded Judge Bechtel that his consent

14

decree meant what it said and required the emissions

15

testing to go forward.

16

In phase five, the Federal Government thought,

17

yes, it would be all right or at least participated

18

without opposition to the final sanction which did

19

produce the carrying out of the consent decree, that is

20

the holding up of federal highway funds.

21

But then in phase seven, the last of the

22

multiplier phases, the Federal Government shewed its

23

true colors again and said, yes, except that on all nine

24

-- I'm sorry, cn all eight projects unbuilt, there is

25

some safety or air quality reason why the state should

Had Judge Bechtel bought that argument pushed

3

on him by the

Eederal Government and by the Commonwealth

4

cf Pennsylvania, I assume there would still be no

emissions testing in Pennsylvania, since it is clear

that is not appropriate on a contingency multiplier,

because there were two things that happened from the

12

certainly it was true here -- a district judge's duty

You think lawyers in your position,

no depending upcn whether you could anticipate an

enhancement if you win?

5

MR.

CRAWFORD:

It is obvious, Justice White,

6

that large law firms in this country -- and I come from

7

one of the large ones, or the Cravath office which wrote

8

the amicus brief for the American Ear Association, are

9

happy to provide pro bono time, and they don't need a

10

contingency multiplier.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR.

Pro bono time at lodestar rates.

CRAWFORD:

Or pro bono time at lodestar

13

rates.

But the fact is, if you write amicus briefs you

14

don't even expect a lodestar rate.

15

QUESTION:

I understand that.

16

MR. CRAWFORD:

There is plenty of charitable

17

work done by our profession.

It's one of its prides.

18

It is not necessary for the person who believes he needs

19

to or she needs to advance --

20

QUESTION:

Well, tell me the lawyers who are

21

going to go through that calculation:

22

for contingency, therefore I don't take the case.

CRAWFORD;

Justice White.

Well, as I understood this, I

Delay, Justice White, is

plainly a factor.

Yes, well, a major factor.

can't take your case?
MR. CRAWFORD:

I would suppose, Justice White,

they would say we can't take as many cases.

They -would

QUESTION;

Well, they're going to say, we're

going to take cases, we’re going to confine our efforts
to cases that we think we've got a pretty goed chance of
winning.
MR. CRAWFORD:

Perhaps even that we're

virtually sure of winning.

And a great many cases that

prove meritorious in the end would not be brought.
Congress, I maintain, wanted

those cases brought.

That's why they passed the fee-shifting statute.

You

1

First, in defense of Rex Lee, I think I should

2

point out that the Solicitor General quoted from a case,

Turner v. Transistor Electronics, and he is re-qucted in

that sense accurately,

5

the language that is quoted in the brief of the

Solicitor General.

but he never adopted or accepted

Even circuits which have awarded contingency

multiplication have recognized that the market rate

contains already something for contingency:

Are you telling us: Mr. Lee was

quoting material that was against his position?

QUESTION:

MR. WALDMAN:

Which he shot down.

critical t!o note that the Court in that case expressly

said contingency and the quality of representation and

all the other Elum factors are often interrelated, are

often interrelated.

Finally, Mr. Crawford concedes that Congress

1

wanted to provide an award that was just enough to

induce competent counsel to take a meritorious case.

submit to you that the whole contingency multiplication

All this risk enhancement can do is create

winning only one out of four or five cases they could be
