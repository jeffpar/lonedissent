is whether either Title VII or Section 1931

imposes on

2

unions an affirmative duty to combat employer

3

discrimination.
The question presented by the plaintiffs'

4

5

petition is,

what statute of limitations should apply to

6

the 1981 claims -- to the Section 1981 claims in this

7

case .

8

I plan to devote my opening argument to the

9

issue raised in the anion's petition, the affirmative

10

duty issue.

My presentation will be in two parts.

I will discuss oar legal position, which is

11
12

quite straightforward.

Basically, our position is that

13

the only duty that Title VII imposes on unions with

14

respect to employer discrimination is the duty not to

15

cause or attempt to cause that discrimination.
That's the duty stated in Section

16

703(c)(3) of

17

Title VII.

18

affirmative duty on the part of the unions to combat

19

employer discrimination.

20

That provision leaves no room for any

Likewise as to Section 1981, this Court has

21

already held in General Building Contractors, that the

22

only duty that Section 1981

23

engage in intention discrimination.

24
25

imposes is the duty not to

Section 1991 does not impose a duty on any
party to combat discrimination by another party.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

To interpret either of these statutes to place

2

the affirmative duty on unions to combat employer

3

discrimination would be inconsistent with the role of

4

unions as set forth under our system of labor relations

5

set up by the National Labor Relations Act.

6

Before I elaborate on these points, I want to

7

address another matter.

8

tried this case on the theory of an affirmative duty to

9

combat employer discrimination; who argued the case to

10

the Court of Appeals on that theory, now say that this

11

case doesn't raise the issue.

12

PLaintiffs who pleaded and

Plaintiffs are wrong about that, but I think

13

it's worth taking a few minutes to demonstrate why

14

they're wrong, because in the process the legal issues

15

here will be focussed.

Plaintiffs' complaint asserted

three claims

17

against the unions.

10

that the unions made many such efforts, and many were

successful.

12

The court below based the finding of liability

13

on this case on a narrower failure on the unions* part,

14

and that is the repeated failure to assert racial

15

discrimination as a ground for grievances.

16
17
18

It was that failure that was the breach of the
affirmative duty found by the district court.
In this regard, it's very significant that the

19

court did not find that the unions*

MS. WEI NBERG:

The Third Circuit, Your Honor,

violated the duty of fair representation,
This oi se was not

— that was not one of the

12

bases for the con plaint in this case, which was brought

13

only on Title VII and on Section 1981, so it's not clear

14

why the district court found that.

15

I think

Your Honor, you don't have to

useful to underst and.

22

for this case, wh y it is tnat what the union did is not

You cannot be

And you cannot act in bad faith.
So that if unions are taking actions which

10

aren’t discriminatory, arbitrary, or in bad faith, but

11

are in fact based on some other ground, the duty of fair

12

representation does not cone into play.

13

And so —

15

finding as to why the union

16

racial discrimination on grievances?

17

Did the district court make a

MR. WEI M3 ER 31

had not raised claims of

Your Honor, I think it did.

18

But I think you’ve got to -- and I think now is as good

19

a time as any to do that — I think you’ve got to focus

20

on the various practices.

21

Because it in effect made findings with

22

respect to each of the practices it found the unions

23

liable for.

24
25

And I think it’s very helpful in looking at
those findings, because it not only shows that this case

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

is in fact an affirmative duty case, but it shows that

2

what the affirmative duty reduces to in practice is

3

judicial second guessing of

4

priorities.

unions tactics and union

I think the basic finding that the union --

5

6

that the court, district court, made was that the union,

7

when there was another ground available for a grievance,

8

would base the grievance on that other ground, and not

9

on the ground of race discrimination.
But the court recognized that the unions*

10
11

reluctance to do that -- and it was a reluctance,

12

because the unions did, in a number of instances, make

13

claims of race discrimination and grievances — but the

14

court recognized that the anions' reluctance was for

15

tactical reasons, not for racial reasons.
For example, if a black employee were laid

16
17

off, and a junior white was kept on the same job, the

18

black employee would have a

19

grievance.

20

entitled to keep the job on

21

very solid seniority

The layoff is out of order, and he was
a seniority basis.

To add race discrimination, a claim in that

22

instance, would be of no help to the grievant.

23

senior, he'll win; if he's not senior, he'll lose.

24
25

If he's

But in addition, and the court found that the
union -- this was the union's perception.

There were --

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there may be disadvantages to the grievant to raise race

2

discrimination in a claim like that.

3

It’s difficult to

prove race discrimination as

4

this case illustrates.

Alleging race discrimination

5

when you've already got a solid objective ground like

6

seniority may well tend to complicate and delay

7

resolution of the grievance.

8

And in addition, as the court found, it was

9

the union perception that raising race discrimination

10

made it more difficult to settle individual claims with

11

the company.

12

These considerations were testified to by

13

black and white grievance men, including a number of

14

plaintiffs' witnesses — excuse me -- and the court

15

accepted these reasons as the reasons for the unions*

16

reluctance.

17

Indeed, the court found that by pursuing this

18

approach, the unions had been successful in combatting

19

employer discrimination in a number of areas.

20

I won't guote it here, but at page 93A of the

21

-- of the petition appendix in 85-2019, the court goes

22

into great detail about how pressing grievances on

23

objective contract ground in fact successfully combatted

24

employer discrimination in a number of areas where

25

plaintiffs nad brought claims.

QUESTION!

Well, Nr. Weinberg, would you

2

contest that the union would be guilty of racial

3

discrimination if it just absolutely refused to process

4

any grievances based on racial grounds, and they refused

5

to process them because they just didn’t want to process

6

racial grievances?

7

KB. WEINBERG:

Well, adding the second factor

8
9

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WEINBERGt

—

I would agree, Your Honor,

11

that if -- well, if a union decides not to process race

12

discrimination claims for racial reasons, for racial

13

animus, then that is clearly a grievance.

14

QUESTION!

Well, what if the union — could

15

it be inferred, could racial animus be inferred from the

16

fact that they just never processed a racial grievance!

17

they just don’t do it?

18

MR. WEIN3ERG!

Your Honor, I think — I don’t

19

think it could be inferred from that fact alone.

20

Certainly in a case where the reasons are apparent why

21

they didn’t do it, any such

22

be overcome.

23

QUESTION;

inference would

in any event

Well, in any event, I think from

24

your recitation of the facts that that claim was found

25

in your favor by the district court.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. WEIN3ERG;

The district court found that

2

the union had not discriminated in processing

3

grievances; that blacks and

4
5

6

whites were treated alike.

And there is no finding anywhere that blacks
got inferior treatment.
QUESTION;

Was there no -- was there -- there

7

was no finding that the union refused to process a

8

grievance because it was a racial grievance?

9

MR. WEINBERG;

No, Your Honor.

There was a

10

finding that in a number — as the court said, in

11

repeated instances, when a black grievant came to the

12

union with a complaint, a seniority complaint, an

13

overtime complaint, a shift differential complaint, and

14

he said to the union, I think that the reason I didn't

15

get what I should have gotten is because of race

16

discrimination, there is a finding by the district court

17

that the unions in that case, when they had this other

18

ground, were reluctant to allege race discrimination.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, what about when there wasn't

another ground?
MR. WEINBERG:

Your Honor, there is — there

22

is -- there are a couple of instances where there was

23

not another ground, and I think you have to deal with

24

those separately.

25

One of those was probationary —

QUESTIDN:

Hell, did it ever file a racial

grievance where there wasn't any other ground?

3

HR. WEINBERG;

4

QUESTION;

5

the district court?

6

Yes, Your Honor.

And that was found -- so found by

HR. WEINBERG:

I don’t think the court found

7

one way or the other, but there are documents in the

8

records which are grievances — which are racial

9

grievances.

10
11
12

And so that tie record --

QUESTION;

Well, did the Court of Appeals

affirm on the basis that — that the district court used?
MR. WEINBERG;

Your Honor, I believe that the

13

Court of Appeals did affirm on the basis that the

14

district court used.

15

some -- some other references.

16

The Court of Appeals through in

But I think its analysis was the same.

The

17

Court of Appeals said that the gravamen of the wrong

18

here was that the union had

19

discrimination as a basis for grievances.

20

failed to assert race

And the Court of Appeals, as did the district

21

court, said that there was more than just a failure,

22

that it was an intentional failure, because the unions

23

knew that there was employer discrimination, and failed

24

-- and failed to raise discrimination in grievances.

25

The Court of Appeals took that finding and put

(202) 628-9300

1

soma labels on it that the district court did not put on

2

it, but I think the issue remains the same.
The court, for example, as Justice O'Connor

3
4

stated, called it a violation of the duty of fair

5

representation.

6

Section 703(c)(1) .

The court said it was a violation of

But I think those are just labels.

7

I don't

8

think the court was seeing the case differently or

9

characterizing the case differently than the district

10
11

court had.
QUESTION;

What if the district court here had

12

found that the union failed to present race

13

discrimination claims when it could have, that it was

14

not racially — that it was not discriminating between

15

black people and white people, that its reason for

16

failing to do that was simply its lack of expertise.

17

We're used to seniority claims; we're not used to race

18

discrimination claims.

19

20
21

Would that state a violation of the union's
duty as you see it?
MR. W5IN3ERS:

I think it certainly would not.

22

Your Honor.

In fact, one of the — one of the claims in

23

this case borders on that -- on that rationale.

24

court found that the unions did object to the company's

25

tests of all kinds.

testified to why the union had done that.
It was already — those grievances were

already were so incredibly complicated that they were

13

processed out of the international union arbitration

14

department, and not out of the local union by local

15

union people.

16
17
18

Proving job relatedness required all kinds of
expert testimony, and technical knowledge and expertise.
To add the second ground, and that is, which

19

would not be necessary if the union prevailed on the job

20

relatedness ground, to add the second ground of race

21

discrimination would add a whole other layer of

22

complication.

QUESTION:

That might have — from what you

say, that might have been an easier ground to prove that

4

Your Honor, the testimony was

But there are a couple of other

One, it was absolutely clear that if it was

5

not job related, the test would be struck, down.

It was

6

not so clear if the -- if the test was — had a

7

disparate impact but was job related what would occur.

8

The union would argue that in that event, the

9

test would be struck down, but it*s not clear that that

10
11

would be the case .
But second of all, one of the union’s

12

objectives was to strike the test down for everybody.

13

If the union won on the job relateiness test, then the

14

test was struck down for everyone.

15

It was not clear what would happen if the

16

union were successful in striking the test down just on

17

the racial discrimination grounds.

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Weinberg, what if the district

19

court had made a finding relative to the Title VII claim

20

that the unions method and practices in the processing

21

of employee grievances had a disparate impact on blacks?

22
23
24
25

MS. WEINBERG:

Year Honor, there was no such

finding in this case.
QUESTION:

I asked, what if the trial court

had made that finding?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

MR. WEINBERG:

1

Your Honor, there would be a

2

threshold question,

and that is that — I guess there’d

3

be two threshold questions.
The first is that 703(c)(2), which would be

4
5

the disparate impact section , we believe is addressed to

6

situations where you have a union that controls access

7

to jobs, a hiring hall, or some other union that

8

actually controls job opportunities; and

9

disparate impact section does not apply to the kinds of

that that

10

union representation that goes on in this kind of an

11

industrial union setting.
QUESTION;

12

That’s not entirely clear to me.

13

Is there any substantial body of authority to support

14

you?
MR. WEINBERG:

15
16

There is not.

the issue is resolved one way or the other.

17

The second point is --

18

QUESTION;

19

The district court here didn't make

a finding one way or the other on that?
MR. WEINBERG:

20
21

I don’t think

No, there was no claim.

That

claim --

22

QUESTION;

Well, there was a Title VII claim.

23

MR. WEIN3SRS:

No, there’s a Title VII claim,

24

but there was no claim that the unions had — had

25

violated Title VII by having a policy which had a

There was no finding, and there was no claim.

I want to add, because I think this is very

4

important, that where the disparate impact really

5

results from

6

you have a policy that the union is applying, and the —

10

for the disparate impact theory, even if I was wrong

11

about my first point.

12

And that is because I don’t think the

13

disparate impact was meant to be a basis for holding one

14

party liable for another party’s intentional

15

discrimination.

16

The party to sue for that discrimination would

17

be the party committing it.

18

the case of unions by Section 703(c)(3).

19

703(c)(3) states the exclusive ground for holding a

20

union liable for employer discrimination.

That would not be a violation.

But I wait to ma*e it clear what we're talking

about.

It would disfavor blacks in the sense that

unions would not be doing -- taking the actions which

would be — which would be most favorable to their

The only rights that are limited under the

contract for probationary employees are the rights upon

discharge, which are limited since 1974 to

Well, does that — could that

amount to a disparate impact finding, in effect —

MR. WEINBERG:

QUESTION:

Your Honor —

— that the union didn't process

12

claims, for whatever reasons, for probationary

13

employees, and that failure had this disparate impact

14

because so many of the probationers being discharged or

15

let go were black?

16

MR. WEINBERG:

It is clear that that was not

17

-- in order -- in order to know where there was a

18

disparate impact on blacks because of the union's

19

policy, you would have had to have proved a lot of

20

things that were not proved in the trial court.

21

You would have to prove what — assuming for

have a disparata impact on blacks.
Because probationary discharges were just one

2
3

of hundreds of possible claims that probationary

4

employees could ha/e.
There was no evidence of that.

5

And there was

6

no evidence on another point, and that is, that race

7

discrimination claims, as we*ve already alluded to, are

8

different from other kinds of claims under the

9

contract.

And you’re comparing apples and oranges when

10

you talk about a race discrimination claim and a wage

11

claim or a seniority claim.
Proving, in this case, to prove their

12
13

probationary discharge claim, the plaintiffs brought in

14

a mass of statistical and anecdotal evidence.
The unions, if they had intended — if they

15
16

were going to process a similar kind of claim would have

17

had to do the same kind of thing.
So you’re not -- all those things would

18

complicate a disparate impact analysis.

made no effort to prove that, and neither court based

its findings on that, and I

MR. WEINBERG;

Well, you know, I say that.

8

And I must confess. Your Honor, I don’t recall the court

saying there was no proper representative for

10

probationary employees.

11

from the other, because the reason the court found that

12

there was no proper representative for the initial

MR. EWING;

Let me — I would first like to address the

And let me start off just by elaborating a

21

little for Justice Scalia’s benefit on the reasoning of

22

the Court of Appeals, because prima facie, it sounds

23

quite puzzling.

24
25

The plaintiffs had contended that there was
discrimination in discharges, generally.

And several of

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the named plaintiffs had been discharged by Lukens.

2

On examining the evidence, the district court

3

found that he couldn't find discrimination generally in

4

discharges, but in discharges with respect to

5

probationary employees, he did find discrimination.

6

And since the Court of Appeals said that since

7

the issue was presented legitimately by plaintiffs who

8

had the right — standing to present the issue of

9

discrimination in discharges, that satisfied that

10

standing problem on that subissue of probationary

11

discharges.

12

Our — our argument on union liability has

13

three basic points.

14

terms with the union's position that the district court

15

did not find discrimination in the handling of

16

grievances.

17

First,

we disagree in the strongest

The district court did find that the unions

18

had discriminated on the ground of race by intentionally

19

showing reluctance to file grievances alleging racial

20

discrimination under the racial discrimination

21

provisions of the collective bargaining agreement; a

22

reluctance which was not shown with respect to the other

23

provisions of tie collective bargaining agreement.

QUESTION;

Yes, I suppose that would be

9

obvious just from the action.

Did it go further and say

10

that the reason that it had this policy was because of

11

racial animus?
MR. EWING:

12

Well,

it suggests it.

In the

13

paragraph that began saying that the situation that is

14

hera is far more than one of mere passivity, it went on

15

to sugqest that the reason was either that it wanted to

16

avoid antagonizing its white members, or wanted to

17

increase its chance of success in grievances with the

18

employer on other issues.
But it*s our position, and I fael very

19
20

strongly that this Court’s decisions uphold it,

21

discrimination is defined as making a difference in

22

treatment.

23

Intentional discrimination is making an

this Court struck down a decision of

a Florida court removing a white child from the custody

11

of her mother because the mother had married a black

13

And this Court said, we recognize what the --

14

the reason the Florida court gave, that there’s a social

15

stigma attached to interracial families, but that

16

doesn’t justify creating a racial classification.

17

QUESTION;

Yes, but Mr. Ewing, you’re giving

18

us constitutional cases in answer to the questions about

19

a statutory issue nere.

20

And is it your position -- I want to be sure

21

— you’ve called our attention to the paragraph in the

22

Court of Appeals opinion which refers to a union which

23

intentionally avoids asserting discrimination claims,

24

either so as not to antagonize the employer and have

25

better luck on other claims or because of the perceived

And it’s your position, I take it, under the

statute, it doesn’t make a bit of difference what the

union’s reason for intentionally avoiding asserting

discrimination claims was, even if the union could prove

resulted in success on many, many other grievances, you

why, because he's found from experience that if shows

The — on the -- on the issues of probationary

22

employees and tie testing, the unions made a lot of

23

their argument that, well, they grieved testing on the

24

grounds of job relatedness rather than violation of the

25

discrimination clause.
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

But ia fact, until at least a year or more

2

after this case was filed, from the beginning of the

3

limitations period, the union had filed only one

4

grievance over testing on job relatedness ground either;

5

and that was over a whole battery of tests.

6

So during the years, except for that one

7

grievance when they were manning a new facility, when

8

the employer was manning a new facility, during the

9

years when the Wunderlicht test was in common use by the

10

employer, day-to-day use, the unions did not grieve

11

that, either on job relatedness ground or on

12

discrimination grounds.

13

Similarly with respect to probationary

14

discharges, the union said,

15

probationary discharges; that’s across the board.

16

well, we didn’t grieve

But the only ground on which they could have

17

grieved probationary discharges was discrimination,

18

because otherwise the employer had full discretion to

19

discharge employees during the probationary period.

20

So their failure to grieve probationary

21

discharges is seen as just another aspect of their

22

reluctance and almost total failure to grieve

23

discrimination ii any aspect.

Presumably, if a probationary employee

2

worked overtime and wasn't paid overtime, yes, there

3

would have been a violation of the contract that could

QUESTI3N:

5

And is it correct that the district

6

court found the union had a uniform policy of not

7

processing any of those grievances for probationers?
MR. E’rfIN3:

8
9

The district court found that.

Now, that was stated both in the testimony and in the

10

district court's findings, in the context of a question

11

about grievances over discharges of probationary

12

employ ees.

13

But even aside from that, the union claimed to

14

have -- claimed to give priority to discharges, to

15

grievances over discharges and suspensions.

16

-- when probationary employees were discharged, that was

17

a different kind of situation from whatever other minor

18

grievances probationary employees might have.

19

So that if

And even though they claimed to give priority

20

to — to grievances over discharge and suspensions, they

21

didn't give any priority, they didn't grieve

22

probationary discharges, which they could have only

23

grieved on account of race.

24

Second, that under Section

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT K. WEINBERG, ESQ.,

MR. WEINBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

With

And I want to add one other thing, because the
evidence is also vary clear on this.
The union had another means to take care of

18

racial discrimination problems that didn’t involve other

19

contract provisions.

20

The contract provided for a joint
