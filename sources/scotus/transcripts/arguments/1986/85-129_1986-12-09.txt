LEVIN;

Mr.

Wimberly, who was

24

then seven months pregnant, went to her employer of

25

three years, J. C. Penney Company, and asked

supervisor if she could have a maternity leave of
absence because she was physically unable to continue
working.
At that time, her supervisor told her she
could have a leave of absence but that the policy of the
company was that it did not guarantee the reinstatement
of an employee in the event that no positions were
available when the employee was ready to return to work.
Mrs. Wimberly took her leave of absence and on
November Eth,

1980, she had her baby daughter.

Three

and a half weeks later she called her supervisor and
told her that she was ready to return to work.

At that

time she was told that, "There are no jobs available and
you'll have to quit."
Mrs. Wimberly then applied for unemployment
compensation benefits with the State of Missouri and a
deputy for the Division of Employment Security held that
she was disqualified because she quit because of
pregnancy, and under Missouri law that's deemed a
voluntary quit without good cause attributable to the
work or the employer.
After administrative appeals and lever court
decisions, the Missouri Supreme Court held that the
administrative decision was correct and that Section
330h(a)(12) is merely an antidiscrimination statute that

a

(202) 628-9300

1

requires pregnancy to be treated the same as disability,

2

and the pregnancy cannot be disadvantaged.

3

But, the Missouri Supreme Court misinterpreted

4

the federal statute.

5

antidiscrimination statute, but rather it is a broad,

6

comprehensive prohibition of

7

disqualifications of eligible women.

It is not just an

pregnancy related

The language and the legislative history and

the whole purpose behind this statute establishes that

10

this was what Congress intended.

12

women who were forced to leave their jobs because of

13

pregnancy and childbirth.

tremendous dsadvantage in competing in the employment

Congress recognized this problem and in the

5

interest of promoting childbirth, protecting the

7

economic security of families, and also preventing

8

family disintegration due to unemployment and lack cf

income. Congress enacted the statute.

The statute is

not an antidiscrimination statute.

QUESTION;

12

MS. LEVIN;

13

QUESTION:

May I ask, Ms. Levin

—

Yes.
I gather the State Supreme Court

14

said that this disability was treated by Penney no

15

differently than it treated any other disability that

16

the woman suffered?
MS. LEVIN:

17

There is no ruling on that, Your

18

Honor.

19

it’s required by statute in a Petition for Beview in an

20

administrative case.

21

whether or not J.C. Penney had entertained

22

discrimination in its policies.

23
24
25

J.C. Penney was named as a party merely because

QUESTION;

But there was no decision as to

Well, what was the State Court’s

rationale, then?
MS. LEVIN:

The State Court’s rationale was
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that the voluntary quit statute in Missouri is a neutral

2

statute and therefore they can use that statute to

3

disqualify benefits to Mrs. Wimberly and to women who

4

leave their job because of pregnancy, as long as they dc

5

the same treatment to people who leave their job because

6

of disability .
QUESTION;

7

And as far as this case was

8

concerned the employer did treat any disability the same

9

as it treated

MS. LEVIN;

10
11

the pregnancy?
That’s not a matter of record.

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

12

Re don't know otherwise, though.

13

It was not alleged -- I mean, that was not the basis of

14

the claim?

15

MS. LEVIN;

16

QUESTION;

That’s correct. Your Honor.
And really, your challenge here is

17

to the state’s unemployment system, and is net to what

18

J.C. Penney did?

19

20
21

MS.

LEVIN;

That is correct, Your Honor.

We

have no claim against J.C. Penney.
QUESTION;

And do you dispute the -- is it a

22

fact that the Missouri Unemployment Compensation system

23

is administered in a way so as to treat pregnancy as

24

other similar disabilities are treated?

25

MS.

LEVIN:

Do we dispute that that’s -- dc we
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

dispute the fact, Your Honor?

2

QUESTION;

3

Well, is it a fact, because I’m not

sure it is.

4

MS. LEVIN;

It is a fact. Your Hcnor.

We

5

don’t dispute that they treat pregnancy and disability

6

the same.

7

pregnancy or disability, you

will be denied unemployment

8

compensation because it will

be deemed a voluntary quit

9

without good cause attributable to the work or the

10

13

Both — if you leave your job because of

employe r.
And, there is no dispute on that, Your Honor.
But the language of the statute is not -QUESTION;

Whatever might be the state rule,

14

the federal law treats pregnancy specially and

15

differently, is that it?

16

MS. LEVIN:

That’s correct, Your Hcnor.

17

this statute Congress addressed pregnancy.

18

address disability.

19

not that of an antidiscrimination statute.

20

In

It did not

And the language of the statute is

Typically, when Congress intends to enact an

21

anti-discrimination statute, it will use the word

22

"discriminate'’ or a derivative of that term to

23

explicitly state its prohibition.

24

Congress has used to state an antidiscrimination statute

25

can be found in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act where a

Another method that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

comparison is made of two groups of people and there is

2

a prohibition that these people be treated dissimilarly.
QUESTION:

3

Ms. Levin, suppose Missouri has a

4

provision, as I understand many states do, that you are

5

not entitled tc unemployment compensation unless you are

6

available for work.

7

individual who is incapacitated for some reason and

8

cannot work would not be entitled to unemployment

9

compensation?

10

MS.

11

QUESTION:

Now, that would mean that an

LEVIN!

That's correct, Your Honor.
Is it your assertion here that by

12

reason of the federal statute, Missouri nonetheless as

13

to pay unemployment compensation to a woman who was

14

unavailable to work because she is in the last few weeks

15

of her pregnancy?
MS.

16

LEVINi

No, Your Honor, on the contrary.

17

Mrs. Wimberly is asserting that she was only entitled tc

18

benefits when she requested reinstatement and was able

19

to work and available for work.
QUESTION:

20

Well, how do you draw that line?

I

21

mean, it seems to me that you're treating pregnancy like

22

other disabilities for the provision that I just

23

described, and they are treating pregnancy like other

24

disabilities for the provision that you are challenging

25

here.

Where ia the federal statute does it say, only

for reinstatement shall pregnancy mandatorily be treated

differently from other disabilities?

It does not

And as we previously noted in Missouri, in

9
10

order to be eligible you must be able to work and

11

available for work .

12

QUESTIGN:

Additionally, Section -I don’t understand what you’re

13

saying.

The federal statute says no person shall be

14

denied compensation, is what it says.
MS.

15

LEVINi

That’s correct. Your Honor.

In

16

the legislative history, additionally, the Congress was

17

very clear that they only wanted eligible women to be

18

able to get benefits, that if a woman was unable to work

19

or unavailable for work, she should not be able to get

20

benefits.

21

QUESTION!

Well, what is -- I mean, "eligible"

22

is a very broad word.

23

24

because you voluntarily quit your prior job.

25

MS. LEVIN:

You are ineligible because you
You are also ineligible

No, Your Honor, you’re not -10

job.

three-tiered test.

In the unemployment compensation system it's a

4

The first question is whether you are an

5

insured worker, you have sufficient wage credits and

6

work credits.

7

in other words, are you able to work and available for

8

work.
And

9

The second question is, are you eligible;

then the third question, even if you are

10

eligible, are you disqualified for a certain reason.

11

You can be disqualified because you voluntarily quit

12

your job without good cause connected to the

13

employment.

14

the job.

15
16
17

So,

You can be disqualified for misconduct on

there is a distinction there between

eligibility and the respondents —
QUESTION:

You would say, then, that if

18

someone is fired because of misconduct on the job which

19

for some reason a woman could attribute to the fact of

20

her pregnancy, all right, or termination of pregnancy,

21

that that misconduct would have to be excused?

22

MS. LEVIN:

It’s hard to attribute -- it’s

23

hard to imagine a situation where the misconduct wculd

24

be attributed

25

to the pregnancy.

QUESTION:

If a pregnant woman --

She claims some temporary mental

2

pregnancy .

3
4

MS. LEVIN;
misconduct on

And therefore engages in some

the job?

5

QUESTION;

That's right.

6

MS. LEVIN;

Typically, if someone is pregnant

7

and she is fired for misconduct, it's not related at all

8

to her pregnancy and she would not be qualified.

9

QUESTION;

I understand, typically, but this

10

woman alleges that that's the case, just as the woman in

11

this case alleges that the reason she quit was because

12

cf her pregnancy.

13

MS.

14

QUESTION;

15
16

LEVIN;

I think that if she could -You would logically have to say she

couldn't be fired, wouldn't you -MS. LEVIN;

I think if she could fully

17

establish that the misconduct was directly attributable

18

to her pregnancy, then she may be able to be qualified.

I don't think it's that clear.

QUESTION:

Why is it not clear?

You're drawing the line between

On the

MS. LEVIN;

This is a

That's correct, Your Honor, but
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the disqualification has to be as a result of her

2

pregnancy.

3

because of pregnancy or if her unemployment as a result

4

of her pregnancy and the misconduct situation — if she

5

can establish

6

pregnancy, then I think she would definitely be eligible

'7

8
9

In other words, if she leaves her job

that her unemployment is a result of her

and qualified for benefits.
QUESTION:

Well, the language of the statute

appears to speak in terms of the reasons that the state

10

itself denies the unemployment compensation.

11

appear to relate to the reasons that went into the

12

employee’s decision to leave work voluntarily, does it?

13

MS.

LEVIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It doesn’t

The language of

14

the statute talks about the disqualificaticn by the

15

state of the employee, but in this situation Mrs.

QUESTION:

Well, solely on the basis is --

refers to the denial by the state of the benefits.
MS. LEVIN:

Yes, Your Honor, but the state

20

denied her benefits because they deemed her leaving

21

because of pregnancy a voluntary quit.

22

QUESTION:

Well, suppose she came in and

23

applied for unemployment compensation benefits and the

24

employee working for the state said, did ycu leave for

25

reasons related to the job or your employer, and she
1 3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

says no, and that’s all the state knows and they denied

2

benefits.

3

Does that violate the statute?

4

MS.

5

LEVINi

The state had no information that

she left because of her pregnancy?

6

QUESTION!

Yes.

7

MS. LEVINi

If the

state has no information

8

that she left because of her pregnancy, I don’t think it

9

would violate the statute.

10

QUESTION!

Well, how can it change because of

11

what the state knows?

12

of the statute, and it refers to the state denying

13

benefits on the basis of pregnancy.

14

because she left work voluntarily, how have they

15

violated the statute?

16

MS.

LEVIN;

You have to look at the language

And if they deny it

Well generally they’re violating

17

the statute by automatically presuming that when you

18

leave your work because of pregnancy it’s a voluntary

19

quit that’s not connected to the employment.

20

therefore, because they’re making that determination,

21

that they are deeming any leaving or absence of your job

22

due to pregnancy as a voluntary quit without good cause

23

attributable to the work, that then becomes the basis

24

for the denia1 .

25

QUESTION;

And

They are not deeming it that.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

is that.

2

fact, objectively, a voluntary quit for a reason that

3

has nothing to do with the work, isn't it?

4
5

I mean, they didn't make that up.

MS.

LEVIN;

That's correct, Your Honor, but

it's also -QUESTION;

6

I mean,

7

putting it in that category.

8

category.

9

It is in

MS.

LEVIN;

don't blame the state for
It is objectively in that

It isn't a category, but Congress

10

did not intend for states to use neutral statutes or,

11

quote, "neutral" statutes to turn around and do the same

12

prohibited practices that Congress was abolishing.

13

the legislative history it is clear that Congress

14

intended to abolish pregnancy-related disqualifications

15

that disqualify a woman because she left her job on

16

account of pregnancy, or whose unemployment was a result

17

of pregnancy.

18

QUESTION;

In

But I thought you told Justice

19

O'Connor that it would not violate the statute simply to

20

dismiss ccmebody for a voluntary quit having nothing to

21

do with the job, if that's all you know.

22

MS.

LEVIN;

23

QUESTION;

If that's all you knew, Your Honor.
And step two is that this is a

24

voluntary quit unrelated tc the job.

Suppose the state

25

has a reporting system that is set up in such a way that
1 5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

all it ever knows from the employer, or from the

2

applicant, is that the person left the job for a reason

3

unrelated to the job.

4

says, you know, nature of reason unrelated tc the job.

5

6
7

It doesn’t have any box that

So long as the state doesn't acquire this
knowledge that it’s pregnancy, is it all right?
MS. LEVIN:

Well, Ycur Honor, if they never

8

acquire the knowledge.

In other words, through the

9

appeal procedure if the woman is then denied benefits

10

and she requests an appeal of the determination and it

11

comes out at the hearing that no, she didn’t just leave

12

her job, she left because of her pregnancy, then I think

13

that the state when they disqualify her on the higher

14

administrative level, then I think they are violating

15

the statute.

16

But, if the information never comes cut, then

17

of course the state can’t be responsible for something

18

that they have no knowledge of and that's not been

19

brought to their attention by the claimant.

20

The legislative history also establishes that

21

this is not an antidiscrimination statute.

The initial

22

bill, prior to the enactment of the final language of

23

the statute, was written in an antidiscrimination manner

24

and had that bill been enacted, the Missouri Supreme

25

Court would have been correct.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

3ut that language was discarded.

The language

2

provided in part that determinations of voluntary

3

terminations of employment shall not be made in a manner

4

which discriminates on the basis of pregnancy.

5

that language was totally discarded by Congress in

6

preference for the broad, comprehensive language which

7

it finally enacted.

8

QUESTION;

9
10

it does single out pregnancy for special treatment?
MS.

12

QUESTION;

13

MS.

15

MS.

17

So, it’s not an antidiscrimination

In your view —

It singles out pregnancy for

For special treatment as compared

18

with other — as compared with other disabilities which

and says, yes, we understand the federal statute to

2

denied workers’ compensation, unemployment compensation,

3

says that the state is violating Title 7, or a man

4

leaves his work on a disability, because you’re treatinq

5

-- because pregnancy is deemed to be discrimination

6

based on sex, isn’t it, in Title 7 now?
MS. LEVIN;

7
8

Kell, it is in Title 7, yes, Ycur

Honor .
QUESTION;

9

So, wouldn't this require the state

10

to treat everybody else the same as they treat pregnant

11

women ?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WEIGHT, ESQ.

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. WRIGHT;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This is an appropriate case to defer to the

11
12

Department of

labor's interpretation of the statute.

13

The Department has consistently stated that Section

14

33Q4(a)(12) bars states from singling out women for

15

unfavorable treatment on the basis of pregnancy, but

16

does not mandate preferential treatment.
Congress has directed the Secretary to certify

17
18

each year the states that are in compliance with the

19

reguirements of the federal Unemployment Tax Act.

20

Because of its central role in administering the

21

statute, the Department participated in the proceedings

22

that led to the enactment of

Section 3304(a) (12).

At a hearing on the unemployment compensation

23
24

laws in

1975, a representative of the Department

25

testified that some states treated inability to work
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

because of pregnancy differently from any ether kind of

2

physical disability, and that that different treatment

3

was undesirable.
Shortly after the enactment of Section

4

5

3304(a)(12), the Department sent the states instructions

6

on its implementation.

7

any provision cf state law specifically relating to

8

pregnancy in the determination of entitlement to

9

benefits must be deleted.

The Department first noted that

The Department then explained that the

10
11

statute, quote, "requires that the entitlement to

12

benefits for pregnant claimants be determined on the

13

same basis and under the same provisions applicable to

14

all other claimants."

15

claimants are entitled to benefits without meeting the

16

requirements of the law for the receipt of benefits.

17

requires only that a pregnant claimant not be treated

18

differently under the law from any other unemployed

19

individual, and that the benefits be paid cr denied net

20

on the basis of pregnancy but on the basis of whether

21

she meets the statute's condition for the receipt of

22

benefits."

23

It does not mean that pregnant

It

In a supplement to those instructions, also in

24

1976, the Department noted that some states denied

25

benefits to claimants who must leave their jobs because
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of illness or injury, including pregnancy.

2

Department stated that the new law permits preferential

3

treatment of pregnant claimants, but does not mandate

4

preferential treatment.

5

The

The Department specifically reaffirmed the

6

views it expressed in

7

solicited during the litigation of Brown v. Porcher.

8

The letter addressed the validity of a South Carolina

9

rule which was essentially indistinguishable from the

10
11

1976, in 1980 in a letter

statute at issue here, the rule at issue here.
The Department concluded that the South

12

Carolina rule was not inconsistent with federal law

13

because, quote, "It does not distinguish between

14

pregnant claimants or any other unemployed individuals,

15

whose separation is due to illness," unquote.

16

The

Department of Labor's 1976 statement

17

regarding the statute and its submission to the Court in

18

Porcher in 1930 accurately summarized the federal

19

government's position in this case.

20

agrees with Missouri that it may enforce neutral rules

21

in determining who will receive unemployment

22

compensation benefits, even though women who left work

23

because of pregnancy are denied benefits as a result.

The United States

24

The Department's interpretation of the statute

25

it administers, which is based on its involvement in the
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

proceedings leading to the enactment of the statute,

2

which it announced shortly after the enactment of the

3

prevision and to which it has adhered through three

4

administrations, is entitled

5

to considerable deference.

Petitioner argues primarily that the

6

Lepartment of labor's interpretation of Section

7

3304(a)(12) is not entitled to deference because it

8

conflicts with the statute's unambiguous language which,

9

in her view, is that a woman who leaves work solely

10

because she is pregnant cannot be denied benefits.

11

In our view the statute plainly invalidates

12

only state laws that single out women for unfavorable

13

treatment on the basis of pregnancy, for the reasons

14

stated by Justice O'Connor earlier.

15

statute makes that clear because it focuses cn the

16

state's basis for the denial of benefits, not on the

17

claimant's reason for leaving work, and prohibits

18

denials based solely on pregnancy.

19

The language of the

But assuming that it is not clear on the face

20

of the statute that it only invalidates rules that

21

single out pregnant women for unfavorable treatment, it

22

is nevertheless clear that the statute does not mean

23

what petitioner says it means.

24
25

As Justice Scalia noted earlier, petitioner
admits as she must that states are free to enforce a
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

number of neutral rules that lead to the denial of

2

benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy,

3

such as rules that claimants must be available for work

4

and able to work.

5

states may apply neutral rules that lead to the denial

6

of benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy.

Thus, petitioner acknowledges that

We pointed this flaw in petitioner’s argument

7
8

out in our brief, and petitioner replies, as she did

9

earlier today, that the language of Section 33G4(a)(12)

10

addresses only disqualification, not eligibility, so

11

neutral eligibility rules that lead to the denial of

12

benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy are

13

permissible while neutral rules looking to

14

disqualification are not.
There is simply no basis for petitioner’s

15
16

argument.

17

"disqualification" appears in Section 3304 (a ) (12).

18

Rather, the statute is addressed to the basis for the

19

state’s denial of benefits.

20

Neither the word "eligibility" nor the word

Moreover, as Justice Scalia pointed out,

21

logically under petitioner’s reading of the statute a

22

state could pass a law that says, all women who leave

23

work because of pregnancy are ineligible fcr benefits.

24

That can’t be what the statute means.

25

Since the language of the statute does not
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

2

must conclude either that it plainly means what the

3

Department of Labor in Missouri says it means, or

4

conclude that the language of the statute does not

5

plainly resolve the question presented.

6

If the Court concludes that the language

7

plainly means that states may not single out women for

8

unfavorable treatment on the basis of pregnancy, then

9

the decision below should be affirmed.

10

If the Court concludes that the language of

11

the statute does not resolve the issue, it is still

12

clear that the opinion below should be affirmed because

13

in that event the Department of Labor’s consistent

14

interpretation of the statute it administers, which it

legislative history?

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MS. LEVIN;

The Solicitor General has stated

20

that he does not understand how the eligibility

21

provisions that we found can apply under the statute.

22

But on page 12 of his brief he acknowledges that the

23

eligibility provisions do apply because of the

24

legislative history.

25

I just wanted to note that,

disgualificaticns of women based on pregnancy, but that

3

the states could go ahead and use their neutral statutes

4

to continue the same prohibited practices.

5

The whole purpose of the statute was to get

benefits to women who were leaving their jobs because of

pregnancy, because it was such a burden and a hardship

8

for these women and their families that Congress needed

to address the issue, and Congress would not have

intended that states use neutral statutes to continue

11

these same practices they told the states to abolish.
