ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. LEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves two Constitutional

11

provisions, the takings clause and the contract clause.

12

The principle that controls the takings issue

13

is simple and well established.

14

this Court held in Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon that

15

regulation which goes too far amounts to an

16

unconstitutional taking.

17

And specifically,

Sixty-four years ago

it held that the State of

18

Pennsylvania

19

coal owners to leave certain coal in the ground in order

20

to serve a public purpose.

21

went too far when it required anthracite

There is, very simply, no meaningful

22

distinction between Section

4, which is one of the two

23

sections of the statute at issue today, and the Kohler

24

Act, which held -- which Pennsylvania Coal held

25

unconstitutional.
3

(202) 628-9300

1

Indeed, the parallels between the two statutes

2

are remarkable.

The operative language in the Kohler

3

Act was as follows;

4

so to mine anthracite coal as to cause subsidence.

It shall be unlawful for any owner

5

Whereas its modern day counterpart, Section 4,

6

states that no owner shall mine bituminous coal so as to

7

cause damage from subsidence.
The one deals with anthracite, and the other,

8
9

bituminous.

But that's the only real difference.

If Pennsylvania Soal is still good law, as

10
11

this Court has stated on many occasions that it is, the

12

then Third Circuit's judgment in this case must be

13

reversed.

14
15
16

The controversy arises out of the following
circumstances .
Pennsylvania law recognizes three separate

17

property interests, or estates in land;

18

estate; the surface estate;

the mineral

and the support estate.

19

My clients’ Constitutional rights are based on

20

the right that as to most of their properties, they have

21

acquired two of these three estates.

22

to understand why it is that they acquired the support

23

estate in addition to the coal.

24
25

And it’s important

Most of Pennsylvania's bituminous coal, which
is located in the western part of the State, lies

hundreds of feet below the ground and is extracted by

2

underground mining.

3

When that happens, the surface will subside.

4

In some cases, the subsidence will cause damage, and in

5

other cases,

6

predict in advance which parcels will be damaged by

7

subsidence, and which will not.

it doesn't.

And it is impossible to

8

Two facts, then, bring the interests of the

9

coal owners on the one hand and the surface owners on

10

the other into an obvious conflict.

11

coal in the ground has no value unless it can be mined.

12

It's worthless unless it can be mined.

13

hand, the underground mining of any coal in any quantity

14

creates some risk of subsidence.

15

On the one hand,

Yet on the other

So that if it isn't mined, it's valueless.

16

And if it is mined, there will be subsidence, and there

17

may be some damage.

18

In the case of about 90 percent of the

19

bituminous parcels in Pennsylvania, these competing

20

interests have been accommodated, and the relevant

21

burdens and risks have been shifted by contract.

22

Between about —

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, are you — are your

24

clients complaining only about parcels as to which they

25

have acquired the support estate?

MR. LEE:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LEE:

4

The coal owners --

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
Nothing else is at issue here?
That is correct.

As to such parcels, do you think

6

that under the regulatory power of government, that

7

there's any leeway for the State of Pennsylvania to

8

prevent and prohibit the taking of any portion of the

9

coal to prevent contamination of water, underground

10

water,

or to prevent destruction of utility lines?
Is that beyond the regulatory power of the

11
12

State?
MR. LEE:

13

Those are -- I think it is not

14

totally beyond the regulatory power of the State,

15

Justice O'Connor.

16

that’s outside what we're talking about in this

17

instance.

18

I want to stress at the outset that

But -QUESTION:

I thought it was part of it.

I

19

thought this act dealt in part with underground water

20

acquifers and utility lines.

21

MR. LEE:

Yes.

Insofar as — and let me draw

22

the distinction.

In the Pennsylvania Coal case, there

23

was a case that the majority -- that the Court

24

distinguished.

25

which dealt with the requirements for mine safety.

It was called the Plymouth Coal case,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think that when the coal miners engage in a

1

2

certain kind of activity, then the State has the right

3

to regulate that activity in such a way as tc make it

4

safe.

But when they go beyond that, and attempt to

5

6

take property in such a way as to -- as to protect other

7

property, then that’s the point at which it goes too

8

far .
And that,

9

10

we submit, is the necessary holding

of Pennsylvania coal.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but applying that to

12

protection of acguifers and

13

view?

utility lines:

What is your

I’m not clear.
NR. LEE:

14

Our view is -- now, of course,

15

acouifers and utility lines is different factually from

16

what happened in Pennsylvania Coal.

17

that it’s a different -- there’s a difference in

18

concept, and

19

different insofar as acquifers and utility are

20

concerned.

But we don’t think

we don’t think that the legal rule is

It’s not private property* public property in

21

22

a sense.

But it involves the same principle, that if

23

Pennsylvania wants to accomplish its purposes — and

24

certainly those are proper purposes -- that there comes

25

a point at which regulation

goes too far, if it takes

(202) 628-9300

1

too much, if it regulates too much, then it goes too

2

far.

3

And the necessary holding of Pennsylvania Coal

4

is that when coal has only one value, unlike the

5

situation in

6

values, and unlike all of the other cases, when it onlv

7

has one value, then if Pennsylvania eliminates that

8

value, it has gone too far.

9

Penn Central, where there were other

QUESTION;

Well, as I understand it, the State

10

requires only a small percentage of the coal to be left

11

in place, from one to nine percent?

12

MR. LEE:

No, that is not correct. • Let me

13

clarify the answer to that.

14

that respect, to the Kohler Act.

15

And let me compare it in

Note the parallels in the language.

Both

16

simply said you can’t -- you can’t mine anthracite or

17

bituminous in such a way as to cause subsidence.

18

Neither statute said you have to leave so much

19

in the ground.

It was assumed however in the

20

Pennsylvania Coal case that

21

required to be left in the ground was about a third.

22

And that’s in the opinion, mostly in the argument

1

Pennsylvania in 1982 adopted regulations which require

2

that 50 percent of the coal underlying certain

3

designated surface structures be left in the ground.

4

Now, the one percent to nine percent that

5

they're talking about is the percentage of the coal that

6

has to be left in the ground, that is, the 50 percent

7

under surface structure; the percentage that that is to

8

the total coal holdings of the company.

9

But they're the same.

The only difference in

10

that respect is that where it was assumed in

11

Pennsylvania

12

what the lower court said as well — was that you had to

13

leave 30 percent of the anthracite.

14

leave 50 percent of the bituminous.

— and apparently correctly, because that's

We are required to

So that these contractual arrangements that

16

were made mostly between the years 189Q and

17

carefully shifting the burdens between the parties,

18

among the parties that are affected, have been

19

rearranged by the State of Pennsylvania.

much has to be left in place?

The State of Pennsylvania’s own exhibit, which

2

appears, Justice O’Connor, at page 284 of the joint

appendix, shows in excess of 26 million tens that have

been left.

Part of the record, though it hasn’t been sent

where those parcels are; where they are in the mining

which parts are going to have to be left.

minute to the question Justice O’Connor asked you.

don’t really dispute the 9.4 percent in this table on

amount of coal holdings.

Yes.
What you’re saying is, 50 percent

of the coal under the house has to be retained.

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

And that is the amount that is have to be left

10

-- that has had to be left in the ground underneath

11

these structures solely because of this statute.

And it is indistinguishable, for those

13

purposes, from Pennsylvania Coal.

think you have a Constitutional right to remove?

Would you suppose that -- why

aren’t those precautions — why wouldn't those be

sufficient to satisfy any requirement for support and to

prevent damage to the surface areas?

11

MR. LEE;

The reason that they don't -- let me

12

give you a twofold answer.

The first is gust a

13

precedent answer, that that

really is the Plymouth Coal

14-

case, which a few years prior to Pennsylvania Coal, had

15

involved the requirement that coal be left in the ground

16

for support purposes -- excuse me, for safety purposes.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. LEE;

Safety.
For safety purposes.

And this

19

Court, in its decision in Pennsylvania Coal,

20

distinguished that case on two grounds, as I read the

21

opinion .

22

One is that it was related to a purpose that

23

is attributable to what the mining companies themselves

24

were doing, that if they’re going to mine, that the

And the second is, that it was only

the period of time that the coal is in the ground.

5

You see, for the miners own purposes -- that

is, for the company's own purposes, they can never get

it all out.

9

QUESTION:

Well, what I really want to know,

as you well know, is why do you -- why is it so

10

impossible that you couldn’t satisfy the act, this act’s

requirements, by saying, well, if we’re going to mine,

12

we can easily supply the support in another way?

MR. LEE:

Yes, yes.

Let me answer that

question, and the answer to that one is -QUESTION:

Suppose that were true, that you

could prove that, would you have any kind of a claim?

It might cost you a lot of money, but would you have

We not only have not been able to

it.

Simple — our contract clause argument is this

24

simple.

The contract clause is there.

It is one of the

25

most specific provisions in the Constitution.

It is the

only -- it is one of the few in the orioinal 1787

document that particularly applies to the states.

3

It has to mean something.

It has to protect

4

some contracts.

5

the height of the impairment -- that the nature of the

6

impairment measures the height of the hurdle that the

7

State must clear.
If the contract clause does not apply to

8

9

And this Court said in Spannaus that

protect this particular contract in this case, then it

10

is hard to see that the contract clause has any value at

all.
Because unlike Spannaus, where, as this Court

12

said, there was one provision that was modified, this

at Pennsylvania law, and a look at the facts of this

case, a couple of very important points.

3

First of all, the support right, the support

4

estate, it may have been given the label of an estate in

land; and we don’t dispute that.

it has no economic value, separate and apart from other

That’s the first part.

It has to be combined with the surface right,

is, no taking.

It's consistent

with our position.

That’s exactly right.

QUESTION:

happened.

9

Whereas in this case the State is saying, you do not

It isn't just saying, you can’t take the coal

12

The State, in your hypothetical, has said you

out.

It’s saying, you do not have the support estate.
NR. GORDON:

is, if you look at the record in this case, we haven’t

Well, that's just like saying, if

you take only one of my hundred acres of surface estate,

it's not a taking.

6

HR. GORDON;

Well, again, the question is, if

7

we are restricting your use

8

that'll get back to my example with the setback

regulations or the height restrictions.

10

— the use of your land,

We certainly restricted the property owner's

11

use of a portion of his parcel, or maybe a separate

12

property right, like air rights.

13

And nevertheless —

You haven't restricted.

proposition that an owner has a Constitutionally

2

protected right in the full use of every segment of his

3

property.

4

That is the development since Pennsylvania

5

Coal, and that’s what commands the result that we urge

6

here .

7

I thin!* we lose sight of the fact that what we

8

are talking about -- or we risk losing sight of the fact

9

that what we are talking about in a case like this is

10

the regulation of business and the use of this property

11

in the operation of a business.

12

And of course the primary -- the primary

13

concern of businessmen are profits.

14

they've shown here,.all that the coal companies have

15

shown here, is that they have lost the opportunity to

16

sell at a profit some small portion of their coal.

17

And yet all that

let the curtailment of maximum profit

18

opportunities never has been viewed by the Court, nor

19

should it, as standing alone, a basis on which to rest a

20

takings claim .

21

The Court has endeavored through the years to

22

apply what it has termed rules of judgment,

common

23

sense, and fairness.

24

it seems to me, which the coal companies ask the Court

25

to draw here, namely that, well, in a case like Penn

The hypertechnical distinctions,

Central, for example, or Goldblatt, you can't draw lines

2

between the air rights, the surface rights, the

3

subsurface rights, and just look at the effect on one of

4

those segments.

5

But in a case such as this, what they would

6

like the Court to do is draw the lines at the boundaries

7

of this protected building; take a look at the coal

8

under there; and just assess the effect on that segment

9

of their property.

10

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Gordon, wouldn't it be

11

more fair in your view for Pennsylvania to tell the coal

12

companies that they would have to sell back the support

13

estate to a surface owner if there were a structure on

14

it that required protection?

15

Isn't that a fair way to approach

16

MB. GORDON;

the problem?

Well, of course, the way this

17

program is set up, we've done that to a certain extent.

18

With respect to some structures, that really is the only

19

right that's available.

20

But frankly the concern here, although there

21

was concern with the people who lived above these mines,

22

it’s a far broader concern.

23

concernasd in — for the interests of land development,

24

for the preservation of the tax base.

25

It’s a community-wide

And that's what makes it fair, in our view.

is there —

3

QUESTION;

Not only

Can’t the owners valve it?

Doesn’t

4

that take away some of the very appealing public

5

interest argument that you’re making?

surface land can waive the application of the statute,

7

can ’ t he ?

The owner of the

1980 the statute was

amended to provide for a waiver under limited
circum stance s .
QUESTION;

11

So it's for the benefit of the

12

surface owner, and not for the polity at large.

13

surface wants to give all of this good stuff away, he

14

can.
MR. GORDON;

15

If the

Well, except there are two

16

reasons why it doesn’t go guite that far.

First of all,

17

let me say that in experience the waiver provision is

18

not something that’s widely used.

19

protections of the Act have been widespread.

And in fact the

20

But second of all, if you a look --

QUESTION;

Well, maybe that’s because nobody’s

22

willing to buy the waiver, since that might be taken

23

away by some later statute.

MR. GORDON;

with respect to the waiver provision, that it only

2

applies if the miner has the consent of the present

3

owner.

4

And what that means is, if the miner gets

5

consent, and

for some reason the land is sold, the

6

consent isn’t binding on the successor.

The point is this

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. LEE;

QUESTION:

16

(Inaudible) 25 million tons, that's

just what’s involved in the 50 percent of --

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

And only -- the

uneconomical to mine the other 50 percent?

any more than 50 percent.

MR . LEE;

2

QUESTION;

3

Would it be economical to mine the

other 50?

4
5

Well — I understand the question.

MR . LEE ;

It is economical to mine the other

50 percent.
QUESTION;

6

So under every underground acre of

7

mineral estate, you can take out half the coal, and do

8

it economically?

9
10

MR. LEE;

That is correct.

But it's the 30 million tons that have to be left.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR . LEE ;

13

That is correct.

Yes.
And that is what this case really

comes down to.
QUESTION;

14

Mr. Lee, could vou settle the

15

theoretical quandry that was raised?

16

that there is a taking of the support estate --

17

MR. LEE;

18

QUESTION;

19

20

Are you arguing

Yes.
— or that there is a taking of the

coal ?
MR. LEE;

We’re arguing both.

We would have

21

the same argument for the support estate.

22

made theoretically much cleaner, much easier.

23

But it is

And also, the case on which we rely, and the

24

case which has not been distinguished through briefs or

25

oral argument, also happened to involve Pennsylvania law

with the same support estate.
And in that respect, Justice Scalia, under

Pennsylvania law, in 1970.17, Pennsylvania Supreme Court

4

case, that support estate can be owned by a third person

5

other than the owner of the surface or the coal.

The case is found at 256 Pennsylvania 416.

Nr. Lee, doesn’t that cut against

you, then?

11

MR. LEE;

12

QUESTION:

Excuse me?
Doesn't that demonstrate — cut

13

against you?

14

coal in place has economic value apart from being mined

15

and taken out of there?

16
17
18

Because doesn't that demonstrate that the

No.

What it shows is that the

22

There is some value in not having the

MR. LEE:

It does have some value if ycu can

23

use it in connection with supporting your mining

24

operations.

25

And by hypothesis, as I mentioned earlier --

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if ycu didn't have

a waiver of surface subsidence, it would also protect

2

you against liability.

3

MB. LEE;

That is correct.

That is correct.

4

But these 30 million tons that we're talking about are

5

what we can't use for any other purpose.
QUESTION;

6

7

Let me ask you one

other question.
Suppose that instead of going about it the way

8

I understand.

they did, Pennsylvania had passed a statute sayina:

10

When you remove all of the pillars underground, they

11

must be replaced with steel structures.

12

Constitutional?

It'd be a lot more expensive, I know.

MR« LEE;

13

Would that be

It clearly would not be

14

Constitutional.

15

Davis' argument in Pennsylvania Coal.

16

premise from which he started, from which I think

17

everyone in the courtroom that day started, that it

18

would be unconstitutional to require concrete pillars.

Indeed, go back and look at John W.

QUESTION:

20

a taking, would it?
MR. LEE:

21

Why would that be?

And that is the

It wouldn't be

It would not be a taking.

It would

22

be a different -- well, I think it would be -- I think

23

it would be a taking in the same sense that Pennsylvania

24

Coal is a taking, but it’s regulation that goes too

25

far.

But it's a different kind of "too far" concept —
