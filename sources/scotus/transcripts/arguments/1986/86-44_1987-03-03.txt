The W i IKo court held that because of the

unique special 12-2 right created by Congress in the

3

Securities Act» which was substantially different from

4

coaaon law fraud» and that It switched the burden of

5

proof fro» the plaintiff buyer to the seller defendant

6

in that case» as well as because of the Wliko court's

7

concerns about the adequacy of the arbitral forum to

8

enforce the special right and the adequacy of Judicial

9

review of the arbitrator's decision*

10

The H I Iko court as a result of this analysis

11

of Section 12-2 held that Congress must have Intended

12

the antiwaiver provision in Section 14 to prohibit

13

waiver of judicial trial and review» notwithstanding the

14

fact that nowhere in the statute or its legislative

15

history did Congress Indicate any evidence that It

16

wanted to use that Interpretation of an antiwaiver

17

provision» which in fact was quite contrary to the

18

interpretation of an antlwalver provision at common law*

19

Petitioners believe that the Wliko court's

20

interpretation of a antiwaiver provision must be limited

to Section 12-2 of the Securities Act for two reasons*

But there is also a second pointy and that

3
4

second reason has to do with the

5

argument to arbitrations that take place under the SRO.

6

The SEC since 1975 has had a very broad authority to

7

review the rules that govern arbitrations under SROs and

8

to modify them where appropriate*

9

which

It is that authority

at the time of Wilkoy we think should

That difference means the factual

of Wilko Is no longer appropriate today*

QUESTIONS

That is a different argument.

2

MR. EPPENSTEINS

It is.

I feel that the

3

non-industry eeabers on the arbitration panel are not

4

drawn from the general public as Mr. Krebsbach argued.

5

They are not drawn froa a pool of the coaaunity as we

6

have in federal court* people who sit on the jury.

7

are drawn froa businessmen.

8
9

They

They are drawn froa people who are typically
knowledgeable about the workings of the marketplace.

10

They are not the type of individual who cones into

12

an unsophisticated investor.

13

1 think we have a disparity there.

14

think It is as great as the bias of having an industry

15

neaber sit on the panel.

QUESTION;
