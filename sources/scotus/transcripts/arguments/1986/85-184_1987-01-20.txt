Mr. Mulliken, you

1

which today are being vigorously adjudicated in a state

2

court proceeding among over 5,000 plaintiffs and over

3

100 defendants.

4

The ether two material conditions imposed in

5

that order were conditions relating to conduct of

6

discovery and the conduct of motion practice.

7

Essentially, the intervenors needed to get permission of

8

any other party before initiating discovery and the

9

permission of any other party in the case before

10
11

initiating motion practice of any sort.
That order was appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

12

We challenged that appeal on the grounds that it was a

13

non-appealable interlocutory order, and the Ninth

14

Circuit agreed, wrote an opinion on the issue in which

15

it cited the 3rotherhood of Railroad Trainmen case

16

decision of this Court, as well as the decisions cf two

17

other circuits which had grappled with exactly that

18

issue, and dismissed the appeal.

19

On rehearing, the Ninth Circuit vacated its

20

opinion, went ahead, considered the merits of the case,

21

reversed Judge Lucas'

22

merits, and merely noted that the question of

23

appealability of this interlocutory order seemed

24

conclusively determined by its former holding in

25

California versus Elock, did not further discuss or

This Court in granting certiorari has limited

2
3

its inquiry to the threshold question of the

4

appealability of that order, and we address that

5

question.

6

straightforward.

7

that the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that Judge

8

Lucas' order was appealable.

Our position I think is very
We think for four different reasons

First, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen

9
10

case itself certainly offers no support for the

11

proposition that the order is appealable at this

12

juncture, where the intervenors, CNA, are in the case in

13

fact and have been and have acquired as a result the

14

right of appeal from any final judgment that may be

15

entered in the case.
Secondly, we think

16

that the order clearly does

17

not fit within the collateral order exception to the

18

final judgment rule as enunciated in Section

19

because it simply — the order simply does not meet the

20

test for the collateral orders exception as enunciated

21

in this Court's1 decision in Cohen and Coopers £

22

Lybrand .

23

1291,

Thirdly, we think that the order of Judge

24

Lucas here was by no stretch of the imagination a

25

practical denial of an injunction warranting immediate

appellate review under 1292.

2

And

finally, we think that the balancing of

3

the equities test offered to you by CNA in this

4

proceeding as a means of resolving the auestion of

5

appealability cf this interlocutory order is both

6

unprincipled and threatens to subsume the final judgment

rule itself, the very fear that I think you addressed in

when you very carefully limited the

me just emphasize and elaborate on each of

12

those points very briefly if I might.

In this case, while it is true that Judge

22

Lucas denied intervention of right, he simultaneously

23

accorded the intervenors permissive intervention.

24

Hence, he put them into the case, giving them the rights

cf appeal that any other party would have.

He didn't

purport in any way to limit that appeal right.
That clearly is the distinction that was seen

3

by the First Circuit in Kartell, the Second Circuit in

4

the Shore decision, the Fifth Circuit in the Wheeler

5

decision, and, ironically, by our own Ninth Circuit in

6

what perhaps we might call Stringfellow I, the opinion

7

that it initially rendered which was subsequently

8

vacated when it had occasion to deal with this issue.

9

With respect to whether or not Judge Lucas'

10

order fits within the collateral order exception to

11

1291's final judgment rule, here again we submit that it

12

simply dees not.

13

might be helpful to segregate Judge Lucas' order into

14

two component parts;

15

And perhaps for analytical purposes it

First, that portion of the order granting

16

permissive intervention and putting CNA. into the case;

17

and then secondly, that portion of the order imposing

18

various limitations and conditions on that permissive

19

intervention.

20

With respect to the permissive intervention

21

order itself,

applying the Coopers £ Lybrand test for

22

the collateral order exception, I think it's fair to

23

assume that without any change in the law that that

24

question, the question of the right of intervention to

be in the case, is I think conclusively determined, at

To shift focus for a moment and talk about the

conditions that were imposed on that intervention, do we

get any different result when we look at those

conditions?

14

reason we don’t is because we flunk not merely one, but

15

I think we flunk all three prongs of the Coopers £.

with you that you should have been accorded intervention

as of right.
What do we do, reverse and have a new trial,

or what?
MR. MULLIKEN;

I guess I think you’d take

22

advantage of the prejudicial error test in determining

23

whether or not a retrial was necessary.

24

you might conclude that the trial court was wrong, if it

25

didn't constitute prejudicial error you would not accord

And even though

2

3y the same token -- I mean, I think that, as

3

I understand the essence of the final judgment rule, the

final judgment rule under

5

degree of erroneous decisions by the trial court.

QUESTION:

1291 clearly accommodates some

So I take it you say then the

7

merits on appeal, the merits of the case and the

8

intervention issue are exactly the same?

MULLIKEN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR.

Well, they may or may not be.

Well, if he affirms they are.

MULLIKEN:

Indeed.

And if he can -- in

12

that case, I think really it's a no harm, no foul

13

situa tion .

14

QUESTION;

And if he reverses, I suppose he

15

can say these people should be accorded intervention as

16

of right.

17

MS.

MULLIKEN:

Indeed.

And that perhaps the

18

limitation on discovery or the limitation on motions

19

that they could bring had materially prejudiced their

20

position and had altered the outcome of the case.

21

don't think you could make that determination until the

22

conclusion of the case.

23

QUESTION:

But I

Mr. Mulliken, how do you

24

distinguish your case from Carson Brands, cr American

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR.

MULLIKEN;

Well, I think, it's fairly

2

easily distinguishable, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

3

general proposition, I would say Carson is acknowledging

4

the appropriateness of interlocutory review under

5

the practical denial of injunction.

6

As a

1292,

I look to Carson -- and again, we take our

7

three-pronged test that was effectively enunciated there

8

is whether or

9

denial of an injunction, whether or not it causes

not the trial court's order is a practical

10

serious or perhaps irreparable injury, and thirdly,

11

whether or not it’s effectively unreviewable.

12

I submit we get to the first prong of the test

13

and we stop.

Carson, I think it was manifestly evident

14

that there's a practical denial of an injunction

15

involved there, that the consent decree which the

16

parties were prepared to enter into I guess I would

17

characterize in the nature of a stipulated injunction,

18

if you will.

19

That is, there was a commitment to undertake

20

certain activities in the context of that case and the

21

trial court's decision refusing to approve that consent

22

decree was a practical denial of injunction.

23

facts of that case I think convincingly demonstrated

24

that the second and third prongs were met as well, that

25

there was irreparable injury and that it couldn't be

No,

several reasons.

statutory injunction claims.

could have illuminated the contours of the injunction in

16

the proposed complaint in intervention with the one that

17

was actually filed several months later, you discover

2

that somewhat curious and I think in some respects it

belies their assertion that this important injunctive

unexercised, even though they have the capability to do

6

that within the contours of this case.
In that regard I might observe that their

complaint that the conditions effectively constitute a

9

practical denial of injunction I think again is belied

10

by the facts.

We’ve had over 100 days of deposition in

11

this case, and to the best of my recollection they

12

haven’t showed up for so many as one day of that

13

deposition.
They haven't requested any of the parties to

may it please

Lark in .

LARKIN;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

the Court:

I have only a few brief points I think I’d

10
11

like to add.

Cur position in this case basically boils

12

down to three propositions:
First, the essential question in this case is

13
14

whether Respondents should be entitled to obtain

15

interlocutory appellate review of the conditions imposed

16

on their participation in this case;

17

Second, an intervenor must satisfy the same

18

criteria that apply to any other party to the case in

19

order to obtain interlocutory appellate review;
And third, the Respondents in this case

20
21

haven’t met those criteria.
At the heart of this dispute really are the

22
23

conditions that were imposed cn their participation, not

24

just the denial of their right to intervene in this

25

case.

It’s only the conditions that can prejudice their

underlying issue.
I think what the new enactment by Congress

12

does is to remove to virtually an entire extent the

13

controversy that exists.

14

word for word in the Court of Appeals, the Government ha

15

conceded that we would be entitled to intervene as of

16

right, and the legislative history of the new Act

17

indicates that it was intended specifically "to assure

18

that persons living in close proximity to the subject of

QUESTION;

Nr. Reynolds, before you even get

to it —

8

MR. REYNOLDS:

9

QUESTION;

Yes.

-- suppose you had been granted

10

intervention as of right, but the same conditions to

11

which you object had been imposed.

12

immediately appealable?

13

MR. REYNOLDS:

Would they have been

Well, that's obviously a

14

different case and it’s perhaps a more difficult

15

question in terms of jurisdiction.

16

answer it, the answer would be that we could not appeal

17

it, because the right which is the basis for our claim

18

of appealability in this case, the right was granted.

19

QUESTION:

I think if pushed to

Well, but what’s your harm?

That

20

seems like a very strange result, to say that if the

21

court had granted you intervention as of right, but

22

denied you the same material

23

whole source of your grievance here -- that’s really all

24

you’re complaining about; you couldn’t care less whether

25

the intervention is called as of right or not as of

benefits which are the

right
What counts is what gees along with it.

And

3

you're telling me that so long as they say you have

4

intervention as of right, but deny you these same

5

benefits, that would not be appealable; but because they

6

denied you intervention it’s appealable.

7
8
9

Why should it make any difference as far as
the appealability is concerned?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think your question points up

10

very precisely the difference between intervention as of

11

right and intervention by permission.

12

is accorded the status of an intervenor as of right,

13

they effectively are accorded -- they enter the

14

litigation on the same status as any original party, and

15

the courts have consistently so held.

16

If an applicant

If, however, an applicant enters the

17

litigation only at the discretion of the court, only

18

based on the grace of the court through permissive

19

intervention, there is essentially no limit on what

20

conditions might be imposed.

21

So that if, in the

hypothetical that you pose,

22

the district court -- if at some point the conditions

23

were a problem, the intervenor as of right would have

24

other options available to it that are available to an

25

original party, such as for example the right to seek

QUESTION:

REYNOLDS i

The difference --

Why would one want to structure a

system where ycu have that kind of different result?
MR.

REYNOLDS;

Well, the difference is that

8

any original party to the case -- presumably if the

9

district court deciied to impose those sorts of

10

limitations, it would have to exercise whatever rights

11

were available to the original party.

12

An intecvenor as of right is on the same

13

level, the same status, as an original party and

14

therefore is not entitled to any further rights of

15

appeal than the original party.

16

QUESTION;

He may be entitled to them, but not

if the court doesn’t give it to them if you have an

obstreperous district court that says, I'm not going to

21

here — aren't the two in exactly the same position, the

22

24

only granted permissive intervention?

So long as both have the right to

The

So for example, if we were to go and seek to

mandamus the judge, there would be no clear and

6

undisputed right that we were asserting, because as a

7

matter of discretion the judge can impose whatever

8

conditions on our participation that the judge might

9

want, and properly so, because the essence of permissive

10

intervention is that the applicant really has no

11

interest, no significant interest, that might be

12

impaired in the case.
But if we are interveners as of right, we have

HR. REYNOLDS:

that in the Brotherhood decision and a number of other

different kind of a decision or order than any of the

I think it is inconsistent with the rationale

to argue, as Petitioners and

5

that right to intervene recognized by the court in

Brotherhood can effectively be in some way undermined or

7

watered down or made less final by an order which

8

through the discretion of the court allows some

unspecified limited right of participation in the case.

10

Under the Government's theory, we are invited

the Government dc, that

11

to a very anomalous situation, namely that a person

12

entitled to intervention as of right who is denied that

13

right can be denied the right to an immediate appeal

14

that he needs to protect his interests simply by a grant

15

of district court intervention by the district court,

16

which may include no rights whatsoever in the case at

17

the trial court, but only the right to appeal after the

18

case is over.

19

We would suggest that that simply makes no

20

sense, and that the finality of our decision, the

21

finality of the denial of our right to intervene, is no

22

less final simply because the district judge has allowed

Now, for example, there are a number of

remedial options which are being considered for cleanup

They would have other options that they could
