ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. WALLACE*

Immigration

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court*
In

11

June of

1984 this

Court held in INS against

12

Stevie that an alien's burden of proving

eligibility

for

13

withholding of deportation tc a particular country under

14

Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is

15

to show that it is more likely

16

would

17

country•

than not that the alien

be subject to persecution if sent back to that

In

18

the present case,

the Court

cf Appeals for

19

the Ninth Circuit correctly

recognized that the Board of

20

Immigration Appeals has consistently taken the position

21

that essentially the same standard,

22

in various ways, also applies to an alien's

23

1

Eoard’s interpretation and remanded the case for

2

reconsideration by the Board under a standard devised by

3

the Court of Appeals.

4

resolve a conflict in circuits about whether the Board’s

5

interpretation of the statute is a permissible one,

6

entitled to be upheld by the courts.

7

This Court granted certiorari to

The Board of Immigration Appeals, whose

8

interpretations are binding by regulation on district

9

directors and other Immigration and Naturalization

10

Service employees, has been

recognized by this Court as

11

the expert body whose interpretations of the immigration

12

laws are entitled to judicial deference.
And after this Court’s opinion in Stevie and

13
14

the conflict in the circuits developed, the Board

15

re-examined at some length its position with respect tc

16

Section 208(a) in an opinion which we reproduced in the

17

appendix to the petition for certiorari, called Acosta,

18

beginning on page 29A of the appendix to the petition

19

for certiorari and taking up the remainder of the

20

appendix.

And I commend that opinion to the Court’s

/

21

22

attention.
There the Board carefully considered the

23

legislative history of the Refugee Act of 1S80, its

24

international law background, the judicial opinions that
*■

25

<

have commented on it, and, as the Court knows, the Board
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

determined that its position had been correct all alcng,

2

and it had good reasons for doing so.

3

The question is whether the Board’s

4

interpretation is a reasonable one that should be

5

upheld, reasonable in the sense that it is not precluded

6

by the statutory language or by the legislative history

7

or by the sense of the statute.

8
9
10

11

And we submit that there are three categories
of reasons why the Board’s interpretation is a
reasonable one, entitled to judicial deference.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, am I correct in

12

understanding that in the Sevic case, whatever it is,

13

the Court assumed the standards were different?

14

MR. WALLACE;

It assumed for purposes of

15

decision, but it expressly left the question open.

16

know, there is some commentary which suggests the

17

possibility that the standards could be different, and

18

the assumption was made for purposes of decision.

19
20
21

You

But this is the question that was expressly
left open in Stevie.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, I’m also concerned by

22

the fact that Congress considered an express requirement

23

that applicants for asylum meet the same standard

24

reguired for withholding deportation and rejected it.

25

And is that something that we should consider in the
'

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

balance here cf how much deference to give tc the

2

Eoard's present interpretation?

3

MR. WALLACE;

Well, of course it can be

4

considered, but there were no circumstances connected

5

with that particular incident that indicated that

6

Congress clearly thought a different standard did

7

apply.

8

which the Board has considered as a whole.

And it*s just part of the legislative background

9
10

I don't think there's any one incident that's
dispositive.

If I can —

QUESTION;

11

At one juncture, at least, the

12

Board didn't think there was any practical or meaningful

13

distinction between probability and well-founded, did it

14

not?
MR. WALLACE;

15

That is still the Beard's

16

position.

That has always been the Board's position,

17

that a clear probability cr likelihood or what this

18

Court called in Stevie more likely than not, three

19

formulations which the Court recognized as equivalent in

20

Stevie, are for practical purposes the same as

21

well-founded fear of prosecution; that while the verbal

22

formulations differ, as the Board put it, for practical

23

purposes the standards converged.
QUESTION;

24

And do you still support the
*•

25

Beard?

1

MB. WALLACE;

That is our position.

That has

2

consistently been the Board's position.

The Court of

3

Appeals stated that that has consistently been the

4

Ecard's position and correctly cited Board decisions

5

starting in 1973 up through the Acosta case in which the

6

Board has stated that position.

7

That is the Board's position.

8

As we see it, there are three categories cf

9

reasons why the Board's position is a reasonable

10

interpretation of the statute.

The first category is

11

that the Board's position takes a coherent view of these

12

interrelated provisions of the statute, so that they

13

make sense considered as a whole.

14

It must be remembered that asylum provides

15

greater benefits in two important respects than does

16

what was before the Court in Stevie, the right to

17

withholding of deportation to a particular country upon

18

a proper showing.

19

20
21

In one respect asylum is broader because it
grants a right not to be deported anywhere.

Somebody

.who shows that he's entitled to withholding cf

22

deportation under Section 243(h) is only granted the

23

right not to be sent back to that particular country.

24

Re may still be deported to some other country if

2

currently.

3
4

There are a number of persons who have been
refugees from Afghanistan coming into our country —
QUESTION;

5

Mr. Wallace, could I interrupt you

6

for just a moment.

7

asylum is a broader right than just the withholding of

8

deportation to a particular country, is it not -- isn’t

9

also the converse true, that under 208(a) surviving the

10

threshold to establish eligibility does not establish a

11

right to asylum, but merely a right to have the Attorney

12

General exercise his discretion and decide whether or

13

not to grant asylum?

14

Although it*s true, of course, that

MR. WALLACE;

That is entirely correct, and

15

the Court pointed that out in Stevie.

16

remembered that this is a highly structured exercise of

17

discretion.

18

But it should be

It is not an ad hoc determination about

19

individuals by the Attorney

General.

In practice, this

20

is an exercise of discretion dealing with mere than

21

10,000 asylum claims per year, an exercise of discretion

22

which is made by the 33 district directors and by the 60

23

immigration judges whose decisions are reviewable by the

24

Board of Immigration Appeals.

/

25

And the discretion is exercised in accordance
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

with legal standards that are set forth in the Code of

2

Federal Regulations and that have been developed in

3

Board of Immigration Appeals decisions.

4

QUESTION;

So that —

Yes, but isn't it true that if ycur

5

opponent's construction of the statute were taken as

6

correct, that there then could be an opportunity fcr the

7

Attorney General to decide exactly what standard should

8

govern that newly -MR. WALLACE;

There certainly could, Mr.

10

Justice, and there is a plausible argument to be made

11

that a coherent way of looking at the statute would be

12

to rely on that distinction.

13

the Board's interpretation is not also a plausible,

14

reasonable, coherent way of reconciling the provisions.

That does net mean that

And the burden in attacking the Beard's

15
16

interpretation is to show that the Board's

17

interpretation is the one that's precluded.

18

have the burden of showing that that interpretation is

19

preclu ded.

20

I concede that it is not precluded, that

21

perhaps the Board could have adopted it.

22

not the question.

23
24

QUESTION;

we'll just adopt the same standard for both?

2

think that kind of discretion is appropriate for an

expert agency?

4

SR. WALLACE;

No.

Do you

What the Board has

determined is whether Congress intended two different

standards, a question that is subject to considerable

debate.

Do they have any more expertise on

QUESTION*

Kr. Wallace, I have a question

that's along the same lines.

What is the extent of the

Attorney General to issue a regulation simply saying

13

that, yes, I have authority to grant asylum tc everyone

14

where there's a well-founded fear, but as a matter of

15

discretion I am only going tc grant it where there is a

16

substantial probability?

Would it be within the powers of the

HR. WALLACE;

17

We certainly would argue that

18

that would be within the Attorney General's authority.

19

He has discretion under Section 208(a).

20

attack would be made on the validity of a regulation

21

because —
QUESTION;

I’m sure an

By these Respondents, do you

23

think?

Do you interpret the Respondents' as, when they

24

say that this is just a discretionary call, does their

25

interpretation of discretion go that far?
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. WALLACE;

1

Well, I’ll have to let them

2

speak for themselves on that.

I’m sure the argument

3

could be made that once the court determined that

4

Congress intended two different standards tc apply, it

5

would be an abuse of discretion for the Attorney General

6

to in effect repeal that difference by regulation.

7

We could argue that his discretion under

8

Section 208(a) should be interpreted that broadly.

9

of course, it would be a more awkward way fcr the law to

But

10

be administered, even if such a regulation were upheld,

11

because then we would be in

12

people to countries where they have shown that they meet

13

the statutory standard of showing a sufficient

14

probability that they would

country, and nonetheless we would be deporting them.

16
17

be persecuted in that

And we don’t believe that the law requires the
Attorney General to make that call.

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, if your first answer

19

to Justice Scalia is correct , then the Attorney General

20

would have the power under the statute to adopt a

21

regulation substantially adopting the standard, perhaps

22

saying except in very exceptional cases on a

23

particularized showing or something like that, you must

24

meet the same standard.

25

t

What you’re basically arguing for here is to

1

give your client less discretion than your opponent

2

thinks he should have.

3

position.
MR. WALLACE;

4

Sc it's in kind of a strange

Well, we recognize that.

Eut

5

there are virtues in this field of delicate

6

international relations and international otligaticns to

7

having the Attorney General being able to point to

8

someone’s failure to meet the statutory showing that is

9

required in order to qualify for asylum status on the

10

basis of fear of persecution.
And we don’t invariably argue for broader

11
12

discretion than we think the law confers on us.
QUESTION;

13
14

So you also have retained a hole

card, Mr. Wallace, because ultimately you’re arguing you
/

15

have discretion in interpreting the statute, so that in

16

the future your client might exercise that discretion to

17

interpret the statute differently if he wants to, I

18

presume.

19

MR. WALLACE;

Well, there is that

20

possibility.

Cnee the Court has upheld the present

21

interpretation, there’s a reduced likelihood that that

22

interpretation would be changed in the absence of a

23

change by the Congress.

24

Well, let me —

25

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Wallace, may I just ask
13

(202) 628-9300

1

this question

2

MR. WALLACEi

3

QUESTION:

4

Of course.

Dees asylum usually lead to

citizenship?
MR. WALLACE:

5

That is the ether major

6

difference between asylum and deportation.

7

year after asylum has been granted, the alien is

8

eligible to achieve legal permanent residency, which in

9

turn then can lead to citizenship.

Within one

And the answer for practical purposes is yes.

10
11

Whereas someone granted withholding of deportation is

12

left standing in the same line he was standing in prior

13

to that, waiting to come in under a quota.

14

in any way advance toward achieving permanent legal

15

residency.

He doesn't

16

Those are the main differences, and they are

17

the key to the coherence of the Board's position here,

18

that aliens facing a lower probability of persecution

19

than is required for withholding cf deportation should

20

not obtain the greater relief available tc asylees while

21

being ineligible for the lesser relief.

22

Rather, the greater relief is available within

23

the Attorney General's discretion to a reduced category

24

of those who qualify for the lesser relief.

i

to tell the Court, that has recently been done with

from Pakistan on the basis of forged entry

Because of the way they gained admittance to

the country,

the Attorney General through the Board has

6

refused to grant them asylum, and these days a case like

7

Stevie is a great rarity.

8

of deportation or asylum, rather than just the

9

withholding.

Everyone asks for withholding

The Attorney General has refused to grant them

10
11

asylum, but because this was not a serious crime he has

12

granted them withholding of deportation tc Afghanistan

13

and the great majority of them have subsequently been

14

deported back to Pakistan, where this is something

15

worked out through international negotiations with

16

Pakistan.
It depends on Pakistan’s willingness to take

18

them back.

19

percent of them.

20

They have been willing to take back some 90

So that is a very meaningful difference

21

between the two standards, which adds coherence to the

22

Board’s position.

23

QUESTIONS

Now, the second category

--

Excuse me, Mr. Wallace.

I just

24

didn't understand that argument.

Wouldn’t the same

25

thing have been doable under the regime that Respondents
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

argue for?

Why couldn't he have done the same thing?
MR. WALLACE;

difference.

That's just an example of the

Of course the same thing could have been

doable with respect to the particular persons, but the
point that I'm making, the coherence in the Eoard's
position, is that those who do not even qualify for
withholding of deportation should not be granted the
greater benefit of asylum.
In some instances you might have -- if you had
the thing the other way around, you might have persons
who would not qualify for the withholding of
deportation.

And the whole question would be whether

they would be granted asylum or deported.
Perhaps in the circumstances we might cheese
to deport them to Pakistan as well, if Pakistan would
take them.

But in the case cf the ten percent that

Pakistan wouldn't take, they would be deported back to
Afghanistan.
QUESTION;

But isn't it true that if they had

satisfied the higher standard of proof and found to have
/

a statutory right not to be deported back to
Afghanistan,

you still could have, under either

I

approach, you could have exercised discretion and said,
we'll ask them to go to Pakistan instead?
*■

MR. WALLACE;

t

That's right, the discretion
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

could be exercised.

It’s just an example of the

2

difference in the benefit.

If somebody qualifies for

3

asylum, however, if there's

a lower threshold and he

4

qualifies for asylum, then he can't be sent tack tc

5

Pakistan .

6

And cur point is that --

7

QUESTION;

8
9

Well, and if the Attorney General

exercises discretion not to do so.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, there's always the

10

possibility that the Attorney General will achieve the

11

same result we are saying the statute achieves, through

12

an exercise of discretion that gets back to that point.

13

Let me rather briefly mention the other two

14

categories of considerations that support the

15

reasonableness of the Eoard's interpretation.

16

the legislative history and

17

Act of 1980,

18

were two propositions established in our law at the time

19

Congress acted that are highly pertinent here.

20

One is

background of the Refugee

and it's important to recognize that there

One is, as we have recounted in our brief,

21

asylum had been created by regulation prior to its first

22

statutory recognition in the 1980 Act.

23

regulations had been amended in 1979 to state

24

explicitly, as we point out on page 17 of our brief,
*•

25

And those

t

that the standard for proving asylum is the same as the
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

standard for proving withholding of deportation.

2

Court recognized this is Stevie.

3

And against that background, both

The

the Senate

4

report and expert, testimony before Congress referred to

5

asylum and the new provision as not changing the

6

substantive standards.
Now, questions have been raised about the

7

8

authoritativeness of these statements.

9

the conference report didn’t repeat that.

%

It is true that
The Senate’s

10

version of the bill on this subject wasn’t the one

11

adopted.

12

Nonetheless, there was no express repudiation

13

of any of these considerations, and the Beard has

14

reasonably relief on this aspect of the law, of the

15

legislative background, as indicating that Congress did

16

not intend to digress from what had been the established

17

law with respect to asylum at that point.

18

And the other thing that was established in

19

our law is that the well-founded fear of

persecution

20

language had itself been interpreted prior to its use in

21

the 1980 law.

22

MS. KEENER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

Understandably, the Government is putting

considerable emphasis on their deference argument.

20

That’s because it’s the only argument that it has.

Stevens, said that, for example, the National Labor

9

Relations Board had been deferred to when it was

10

construing even a provision of the Act, net that its

11

view was final but that it was given deference.
Are you suggesting that the INS in this case

12
13

should be given no deference simply because it is

14

construing a term of the statute?
MS. KEENER;

15

No.

Cf course the Court also

looks at other factors, and deference cases talk about

QUESTION;

19

Well, my question to you was, which

20

I don’t think you’ve yet answered, is is the agency

21

entitled to no deference because what it is construing

22

is a term of the statute?
MS. KEENER;

23

I think that answer is probably

24

correct.

But in arriving at whether deference is

25

considered or not, the courts usually look at several

QUESTION;

Well, is deference one of these

factors or not?
MS. KEENER;

Well, it can be if a standard is

not a question of pure law,

if it is an application cf

the law to a specific set of facts.

And courts often

MS.. KEENER;

There was a technical gap in

it was construing a term involved in implementing a
standard.
However, here the standard was explicitly set
forth by Congress as a well-founded fear standard.
Congress went even further.

That's correct.

Because the

standard was selected by Congress, because Congress

of the standard, okay.

United States law for 30 years

11

has had separate refugee admissions policies and

12

separate standards and statutes which relate to the

13

deportation of refugees.

14

Since 1948, the refugee admission standards

15

have been based on a good reason to fear formulation,

16

and that was derived from the United Nations — the

17

grandfather of the United Nations protocol, which is the

18

International Refugee Organization constitution,

19

starting with a good reason to fear standard, a fear of

20

persecution standard.

That fear of persecution standard is traced in

23

provision to the current provision today of the 1965

Act.

The agency itself has recognized that goed

standard than the standard under withholding of

QUESTION;

And as

Ms. Keener, let me interrupt you if

I may.

Why couldn't the Attorney General, for example,

determine that in cases of refugees from Afghanistan,

that if he sends them back to Pakistan they will not be

persecuted because they're safe there, and adopt a

policy on a country by country basis of one rule for

MS. KEENER:

provide for the lesser benefit of avoiding deportation.

Your response to that argument,

your principal response in ycur brief, is nc, it's net
irrational because the standard for purposes of asylum
is a discretionary one.

regulatory asylum should be adopted as the standard also

in 1965.

There was no standard for regulatory asylum
In 1965, what Congress was talking about at

that time, at the time of our accession,

was the gccd

reason to fear standard in the predecessory section of
203(a)(7), which is what we have been saying over and
over and over.
That's what the legislative history shows, and
the Government has never come up with an answer as to
why the specific standard for regulatory asylum which
they finally set forth in the 1979 regulations, that
standard was expressly rejected by Congress in its
actions.
And the Government has never come up for a
justification how to avoid Congress' clear intent.

In

interpreting legislative history, again, it's a canon of
construction that the court does not lightly disregard
what Congress has considered and explicitly refused to
do.

The Government, yes, they proposed a
formulation of the bill and

that formulation, which

would have said in essence that if someone qualifies
for, show a clear probability of persecution, then they
are eligible for asylum.

And the other major flaw in the Government's

that there's another asylum provision, another refugee

And that's Section 207.

Mr. Wallace, before you start, I

to answer it.

I want you to tell us your position with

MR. WALLACE;

We simply don’t agree that a

MR. WALLACE:

of our reply brief, we pointed out that the House report

explicitly said at the time of the 1980 Act that the

asylum provision was to provide a statutory basis for

the part 108 regulatory asylum policy, not tc provide a

5

statutory basis to replace the old 203(a)(7) or the

other earlier statutes.

And that was the policy that in the 1979

regulations said that the asylum standard was the same

as the standard for the withholding of deportation.

Now, I also want to point out to the Court

2

3

that in its decision in Immigration and Naturalization

4

Service against Jong How Hang, 450 D.S.

deferred to the INS', to the Board’s interpretation of a

6

statutory term, "extreme hardship" under Section 244 of

7

the Immigration and Naturalization Act — Nationality

8

Act.

9

139, the Court

And it not only deferred to the

10

interpretation, but deferred to a categorical

11

interpretation, that the Board was entitled to take the

12

position that a mere showing of economic detriment is

13

not sufficient to show extreme hardship within the

14

meaning of that statutory provision.
And the last point I wish to make is that the

15
16

mere fact that a reference is made in our statute tc a

17

term in the international protocol does net mean that

18

this case presents a question of international law.
