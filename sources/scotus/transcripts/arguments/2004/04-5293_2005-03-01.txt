ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSEMARY E. PERCIVAL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. PERCIVAL:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
The question before the Court today is whether

11

the trial court violated Carman Deck's rights to due

12

process and a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding, as

13

guaranteed by the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth

14

Amendments, when the trial court forced him to appear

15

handcuffed to a belly chain and shackled in legirons

16

before the jury which would determine whether he was to

17

live or to die.

18

Counsel objected to the restraints and filed a

19

motion asking for the procedures set forth by this Court

20

in Holbrook v. Flynn.

21

inherently prejudicial practice and set forth a procedure

22

by which courts would exercise their discretion in

23

maintaining courtroom security while protecting the rights

24

of the defendant.

25

Holbrook described shackling as an

If the court is to impose an inherently

prejudicial practice like shackling, it first must

2

determine that the shackles are necessary to further an

3

essential State interest specific to the trial and must

4

find that no lesser means is available to meet those State

5

interests.

6
7

The court abused its discretion in failing to
apply the Holbrook standard in penalty phase.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the -- did counsel

9

suggest less intrusive restraints?

10

MS. PERCIVAL:

Counsel had filed an extensive

11

motion in which it set forth a number of different ways in

12

which courts in Missouri and in other jurisdictions had

13

dealt with the problem where the -- where the courts

14

minimized the effect of the shackles on the jury by hiding

15

them from view such as by placing boxes around counsel

16

table, ensuring that the defendant was already in place in

17

the courtroom before the jurors entered, that sort of

18

thing.

19

And the court summarily overruled that motion.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What was the basic

20

justification in the first place for shackling?

21

were there insufficient bailiffs or -- or why did they do

22

it in -- even in -- during the trial itself?

23

MS. PERCIVAL:

I mean,

The court did not establish a

24

record for why the shackles were -- were warranted.

The

25

only justification that the court gave was -- at this

penalty phase retrial was that Deck had been convicted,

2

but there's nothing else in the record as to what

3

justification the court had.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

there were or were not present court security officers?

6

MS. PERCIVAL:

There's nothing in the record as

to security officers in the courtroom.

9

Is there any indication that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who -- who should -- whose

responsibility should it be to get something like that

10

into the record?

11

idea whether there was a good reason for the shackling or

12

not.

13

I mean, I read it.

MS. PERCIVAL:

I don't -- I have no

Once defense conviction objects

14

to the use of shackling, it is incumbent upon the State to

15

show that the restraints were harmless, and by doing so,

16

they would need to make a record that -­

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What's the authority for the

18

burden of proof question?

19

cases do you rely on for that?

20

MS. PERCIVAL:

What -- what -- which of our

Well, it's basically Chapman

21

because shackling is an inherently prejudicial procedure,

22

and when the court imposes that without justification, the

23

burden falls on the State to show that it was, in fact,

24

justified or that the shackling was -- was harmless and

25

that the jurors could not see it or that sort of thing.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the principle is there's a

2

right not to be shackled, and when the State says that

3

that right has to be compromised, then the State has to

4

have the burden of proof?

5

MS. PERCIVAL:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

And I looked -- and I find

that rule in Chapman?

8
9

Yes.

MS. PERCIVAL:

No, it would not be in Chapman.

It would -- it's -- it flows from Holbrook and Illinois v.

10

Allen and Estelle v. Williams.

11

standard that is really enunciated in Holbrook.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Those cases set up the

Those -- those are all, are

13

they not, cases involving the -- the guilt phase of -- of

14

a trial?

Right?

15

MS. PERCIVAL:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, this is a little

17

different.

He -- I mean, when you shackle somebody who

18

hasn't yet been convicted, you -- you send a message to

19

the jury that, you know, this -- this person belongs in

20

irons.

But the jury had already found this person guilty.

21

MS. PERCIVAL:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MS. PERCIVAL:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. PERCIVAL:

He was -- he was convicted.

Yes, and -­
Should that make no difference?

that shackles are inherently prejudice, it stems from -­

phase, courts have held that shackles are inherently

5

prejudicial because they make the defendant appear -­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. PERCIVAL:

In guilt

Guilty.

-- dangerous, violent,

8

untrustworthy, and then hence, they are more likely to be

9

guilty.

10

Notably in -- in guilt phase, there's no

11

question as to character.

12

where the State still has a burden of establishing that

13

the defendant is worthy of a death sentence by evidence

14

presented in court, the question of character is a key

15

factor that the jury considers.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In penalty phase, however,

20

Did counsel object that there shouldn't have

MS. PERCIVAL:

Counsel filed a motion saying

21

that there should not be restraints at all, but within

22

that motion, he explained how courts in Missouri had

accommodated --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But he did take the position

that there was no need for shackles at all.

3

MS. PERCIVAL:

Yes, yes.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Back on your earlier part of

5

your answer to Justice Scalia, that it's inherently

6

prejudicial in the sentencing stage, if one of us were to

7

agree or the whole Court, the majority, were to agree with

8

your position and write the opinion out, what would we

9

cite for that, other -- other than our -- our own

10
11

assumptions as to how the system worked, judicial notice?
MS. PERCIVAL:

Well, I think that you could

12

follow Holbrook pretty closely and that I think what you'd

13

need to -- to deal with is there's a whole bunch of

14

precedent regarding how prejudicial shackling is.

15

that character is essential in penalty phase, and the

16

other characteristic of penalty phase is the heightened

17

for reliability which is not present in the guilt phase.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

With -- with character, we

MS. PERCIVAL:

I'm really not sure if I -- if I were a prosecutor whether

of the jury's giving the death penalty or -- or to the

contrary, make the juror think, boy, what a wretched life

16

this is and -- and that ought to be enough.

17

And I -- I might think that showing, you

MS. PERCIVAL:

Well, Your Honor, in Beck v.

18

Alabama, a similar situation arose.

In Beck, the question

19

was whether Alabama's statute which prohibited the jury

20

from getting lesser included offense instructions in a

21

first degree murder case was constitutional.

22

Stevens in his opinion writing for the Court stated that

23

there may be factors that cut in favor of the defendant

24

and factors that cut against the defendant, but the

25

uncertainty and unreliability that is forced into the

fact-finding process is what the problem is.
So as in this situation, perhaps some jurors

3

would -- would think, you know, he's wearing these

4

shackles just because he was convicted.

5

may, as well, say he's wearing them because he's

6

particularly dangerous.

unreliability of the -- the fact-finding process since the

8

defense has not been able to confront this evidence and it

hasn't come in from the stand.

Others might -­

We don't know, and there's that

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What are the factors in

11

Missouri that the State would be trying to prove to urge

12

the imposition of death versus life imprisonment?

13

are the things in Missouri that are deemed relevant?

14

MS. PERCIVAL:

What

Well, there are statutory

15

aggravating circumstances, and the jurors are also allowed

16

to consider non-statutory evidence.

17
18
19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Is future dangerousness an

issue in Missouri?
MS. PERCIVAL:

It is not a specific aggravating

20

circumstance, but it's something that is -- is certainly

21

relevant and that the jurors can consider.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does your whole case turn on

23

how shackling affects the argument that you're -- that the

24

accused is making that he's not dangerous, et cetera, or

25

is there some other different standard that we could use

Page 10

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to the effect, say, that it's just not consistent with the

2

dignity in an American courtroom, something like that?

3

MS. PERCIVAL:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does your whole case turn on

5

whether or not this is prejudicial to the fact-finding

6

process on the specific issues or is there some more

7

general standard?

8
9

MS. PERCIVAL:

Well, there are certainly other

considerations that shackling affects.

Shackling impedes

10

participation in the trial by affecting how the client can

11

communicate with counsel and that sort of thing, how the

12

jurors will gauge his demeanor, whether his mental

13

faculties will be diminished through the shackling.

14

argument here -- because counsel did not specifically

15

object on grounds of right to be present, our argument

16

here focuses on how the jury viewed the defendant, given

17

the fact that he was in these -- this extreme form of

18

restraints, and these extreme restraints were unjustified.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Our

In the prison setting, does

20

he wear such restraints?

21

jury might say, wow, that's the way he has to go around

22

the rest of his life with the -- all chained up.

-- do we know whether in the prison he would be routinely

24

wearing these restraints?

I -- once again, if I were a prosecutor, I'd

rather have him dressed up in a nice, new suit and his

hair combed and smiling.

15

having him in shackles.

17

I would much prefer that to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

ways.

5

other considerations here.

6

I -- I do think it may cut both

And that's why I'm asking you is if there are some

MS. PERCIVAL:

Well, I think -- I don't think

7

there's other considerations other than, you know, this is

8

penalty phase of a capital trial where we have to have the

9

reliability of the fact-finding process.

And the jurors

10

are gauging the character of this defendant.

11

mentioned in your concurring opinion in Riggins, the jury

12

is searching to discover the heart and mind of this

13

defendant, and considerations such as character or future

14

dangerousness are very important and may, in fact, be

15

determinative of what sentence the defendant receives.

16

And as you

Shackling a defendant basically places a thumb

17

on death's side of the scale and dehumanizes the

18

defendant, making it easier for the jury to find that he

19

is worthy of a death sentence.

20

The Holbrook standard that this Court

21

established is a great standard.

It has been in effect

22

for -- for decades and it works.

It is efficient and it

23

is just as easily applied in penalty phase.

24
25

Holbrook promotes the reliability of a death
determination by limiting the risk that impermissible

considerations will come into play.

2

consideration of the individual circumstances of the case

3

that is so crucial in the penalty phase.

4

Holbrook --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It also allows

Let me ask you this.

You, of

6

course, would object to having to show prejudice in any

7

individual case.

8

that's prejudice -- that that means because prejudice is

9

difficult to show.

10

Then it seems to me, to follow, that

And if prejudice is judicial -­

difficult to show, why should we rule for you anyway?

11

MS. PERCIVAL:

Because we are concerned with the

12

reliability of the death sentence.

13

inherently prejudicial in guilt phase where character

14

isn't even at issue and that has a lesser standard of

15

reliability, then they certainly are inherently

16

prejudicial in the guilt -- in the penalty phase where the

17

defendant's life is at stake.

If -- if shackles are

18

And as Justice O'Connor has recognized in her

19

concurrence in the Eddings v. Oklahoma case, this Court

20

goes to extraordinary measures to ensure that the

21

defendant sentenced to be executed is afforded process

22

that will guarantee, as much as humanly possible, that the

23

sentence was not imposed out of whim, passion, prejudice,

24

or mistake.

25

Shackling opens the door to prejudice and

defendant is particularly dangerous and therefore worthy

of a death sentence.

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you make of the judge

6

-- well, the jury, already having been polled, and every

7

one of them said this would not affect our judgment?

8

MS. PERCIVAL:

This Court in Holbrook dealt with

9

the same situation, and the Court in that case held that

10

when a procedure presents such a probability of prejudice

11

that it is inherently lacking in due process, little stock

12

need be placed in jurors' claims to the contrary because

13

jurors may not even be conscious of the effects that

14

shackling will have.

15

And at that point in the proceedings, the jurors

16

had not been instructed as to what specific factors they

17

would be looking at.

18

four steps in their sentencing procedure.

19

know how this would play into it.

20

they would not be affected really should have little

21

So their response that

Suppose the judge had said this

24

He convicted them -- as the jury knows, he was convicted

25

2

well, if he killed two people to avoid being sent back to

prison and we've just voted him guilty, maybe he's going

to try to lunge out in the courtroom and get us.

5

The jury may sit there and think,

MS. PERCIVAL:

8

guess what you're saying is if the jurors believe that the

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

why I'm asking.

15

this is inherently inconsistent with the atmosphere we

16

want to have in a courtroom.

18

it seems to me that has to be your argument.

had simply had shackles around his ankles that would have

23

prevented him, in -- in effect, from running or lunging at

anyone, but that that had been concealed by appropriate

25

covers around the table where he was sitting so that the

Justice Kennedy alluded to one of your earlier arguments,

if the -- the hands are shackled, he can't write notes to

I thought you meant by that

Do you mean something else?
MS. PERCIVAL:

Well, there are two different

17

angles on that.

First, there's the ability to communicate

18

with counsel, such as by taking notes.

19

is if the shackles are so distracting to the defendant or

20

causing him pain that he will not be able to concentrate

21

on what is going on at the trial to enable him to help his

22

attorney and participate.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The other aspect

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

But that would be true if he

were in the legirons.

MS. PERCIVAL:

That -- you're right, Your Honor.

There's no question he was

don't know that that means he's dangerous in a courtroom.

suggests that he's dangerous right off.

whether or not he's dangerous in the courtroom, there's

would ask that or like to move to strike the entire jury

Now, at that point, you have to do -- then isn't it up to

the prosecution to say, what do you mean looking at them?

13

They can't see them.

MS. NIELD:

They're hidden.

sequence is critical.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you don't concede it.

I do not concede it.

Yes, but your position would

be precisely the same if the record made it perfectly

clear that the jury could see everything, I think.

I think the test would be the same.

That's -­

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

MS. NIELD:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

Yes.

That's true.
So this is an alternative

argument that you're making.

14

MS. NIELD:

That's true.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the State of Missouri is

16

submitting to us the proposition that every defendant in

17

every case can be shackled so long as it's not visible.

18

And I -- I find that an extreme position because it's an

19

indignity on the defendant and the defendant is entitled

20

to dignity in a courtroom.

21

MS. NIELD:

Well, this points up the distinction

22

in this case between guilt phase and penalty phase.

And

23

what we're talking about here and the rule that I am

24

urging this Court to adopt relates to the penalty phase.

25

And in the penalty phase, like Mr. Deck's, we have a

There are reasons spread upon this record that justify

2

additionally the use of restraints against Mr. Deck.

MS. NIELD:

What you state is true, but by the

10

time of the penalty phase retrial, Mr. Deck's position, to

11

paraphrase from Martinez v. Court of Appeal, had changed

12

dramatically.

13

he had already pursued his direct appeal through the

14

Missouri Supreme Court.

15

He had already been convicted.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Add to that

Is the fact of conviction

16

critical for your point of view because it doesn't really

matter if there's prejudice or that because there's no -­

18

no danger of prejudice?

MS. NIELD:

I'm not sure I understand your

question.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, do you concede that even

22

though he had been convicted, it would, nevertheless, be

23

prejudicial in the eyes of the jury to see a man shackled

when one of the issues they'll have to decide is whether

his future dangerousness might -- might justify his

simpler had the trial court been a little wordier, and

in mitigation.

murders were an aberration -­

21

In

His defense in mitigation was not that he

It was not that these

Yes, but would you not agree

that it's always of relevance to a jury in deciding

whether the -- the man should be executed, is how

dangerous is this guy?

2

this case, Mr. Deck's defense in mitigation was not that

he was a safe individual or, again, that the murder of

4

these two people was an aberration in an otherwise saintly

5

life.

6

But on the facts of

That's not the case.

like that, therefore you don't have to worry about the

2

MS. NIELD:

we're looking at reliability.

is restraining somebody who's twice been convicted of

murder is not in any way unreliable or misleading.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and the bottom line

Yes, but the bottom line from

7

the other point of view is that shackles are always

8

prejudicial, and you try to have the scales evenly

9

balanced when you're deciding whether the man should die

10
11

or not.
MS. NIELD:

In terms of making that decision,

it's important to remember that Missouri has procedures in

To the contrary, it might be confusing and cause

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we know why the judge

apparently changed his mind?

correctly, at the pretrial hearing, the court said that

and, B, to have leg braces underneath for security.

whether or not the trial court's action was reasonable.

And in looking at reasonableness, we can consider are

there other perhaps less visible, less dramatic forms of

11

restraint that might do the job equally well.

to say, however, that a -­

the objection, anything that they thought that might be

don't believe a least restrictive alternatives approach is

appropriate, but when you talk about least restrictive, I

the facts of this case, spread upon the record, support

the use of restraints in this case.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Could you point me to places

in the record where it supports your position on the use

of the visible restraint?

MS. NIELD:

Yes.

Mr. Deck had an aiding escape

attempted escape that Justice Scalia referred to.

(Laughter.)

MS. NIELD:

He -- he had a saw blade and he

assisted these other individuals in sawing their way out.

So there's that, both a conviction -­

8

risk of fleeing from the courtroom while the proceedings

9

are going on.

10

MS. NIELD:

I mean, the fact that he

I -- I must disagree.

I think if

11

he's aiding other people in escape, he himself tried to

12

remove the glass from the window when he was held in jail

13

prior to trial by removing the caulking.

14

to escape in those circumstances, what's to say he's not

15

willing to escape in the Jefferson County courtroom?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he is willing

So we already know that -­

17

that that effort was made before he was tried in the guilt

18

phase.

19

MS. NIELD:

That's true.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And whatever inference you

21

might draw, it didn't prove out.

So it seems to me the -­

22

the closest in time is the -- and -- and in fact is the

23

episode he's just been through, the trial episode.

24

wouldn't that be -- the -- the judge would start with that

25

in mind.

So why

Well, I tried this man and he didn't give me any

problems, so I have no reason to anticipate problems now.

2

MS. NIELD:

That's true.

But again, we also

3

have the fact that he had -- between the initial penalty

4

phase and the penalty phase retrial, Mr. Deck had pursued

5

his direct and post-conviction appeals.

6

successful on the issue of guilt.

7

done.

8

at that time.

The issue of guilt is

He's a twice-convicted murderer.

9

They had not been

And he knew that

Furthermore, we have the fact that the first

10

jury in the penalty phase found one of the six aggravating

11

circumstances -- actually they found all, but one of them

12

was that Mr. Deck killed in order to avoid lawful arrest.

13

He has 12 convictions on his record, and at the time that

14

he killed the Longs, he knew that if I leave witnesses and

15

they can identify me and I go to prison for breaking into

16

their house and stealing money, I will not be leaving

17

prison.

18

as well.

19

So that was a factor as well.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That was a factor

If -- if there are some factors

20

that favor putting him in shackles and I guess others

21

might not, what's the argument that the judge shouldn't at

22

least have to make a finding?

23

MS. NIELD:

Again, the question is

24

reasonableness.

We don't have a finding here, and it

25

would certainly have been helpful.

But --

want to save the conviction and the penalty, but if you

why the judge shouldn't have to at least make a finding.

13

MS. NIELD:

Right.

Findings would certainly be

14

helpful, but again, the question is whether or not what

15

the trial court did is reasonable, not if what he did was

16

perfect.

17

like an attempted escape, aiding others in escaping, the

18

fact that he killed to avoid lawful arrest, the fact that

19

between his initial penalty phase and the retrial he had

20

pursued his remedies.

21

say that the trial court was on the side of

22

unreasonableness versus reasonableness?

23

wait for Mr. Deck to actually have an outburst?

24

could be something where it's an -- an issue of the

25

spectators in the courtroom.

If conspicuous on this record, we have factors

With all these facts, can we really

It could be an issue of what the particular confines of

2

the Jefferson County courthouse are and whether or not

3

it's set up in such a way as to avoid escape and things of

4

that nature.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With a -- with a blank record

6

-- the -- the State is going to restrain someone and it

7

may be necessary, it may be not, and if the State has the

burden, then why shouldn't a reviewing court speculate on

what might have been when the only thing that was -­

There's nothing situation-specific about it.

That's true.

First of all, again, the defense in

poor upbringing.

So, again, none of these factors -- there's no

the guilt finding -- no nexus between these aggravating

20

circumstances that render Mr. Deck death-eligible and any

21

sort of dangerousness that the jurors might take away from

22

the fact that he was restrained.

Once you get past the death-eligibility hurdle

24

with the aggravating circumstances, then comes the Eighth

Assuming that it is a

harmless error?

7

MS. NIELD:

An example of where it might not be

harmless error is where the defendant's defense in

mitigation is focused specifically on dangerousness or

10

future dangerousness.

11

mitigation is I committed these murders, but I'm very sick

12

now, I'm feeble, I'm not going to pose any sort of threat

13

to anybody inside or outside the prison walls, if the

14

defense in mitigation relates to danger.

15

if the defense in mitigation was that while incarcerated,

16

the person had found religion and realized the error of

17

his or her ways and was no longer inclined to do these

18

things and felt remorse, that again might relate.

proclivity for attacking elderly women and that was the

9

nature of his crime.

In the Simmons line of cases, in one of the cases

women, and so he would not pose a danger to anyone outside

killing not one, but two people, to do that does not send

And

If he -- if he were kept
