ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. BERGMANN:

Good morning.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The Court today is presented with two strikingly

11

different interpretations of when the 1-year period of

12

limitation found in paragraph 6(3) of 28 U.S.C., section

13

2255 begins to run.

14

If paragraph 6(3) is read in a manner that is

15

consistent with both Congress' use of verb tense and this

16

Court's decision in Tyler v. Cain, then the Government's

17

interpretation of when the 1-year period begins to run is

18

absurd because it reduces paragraph 6(3) to a near

19

nullity.

20

admits, retroactivity decisions almost always come more

21

than a year after a decision of this Court initially

22

recognizing a right.

23

This is so because, as even the Government

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

When you say it's a

24

nullity, what you really mean is it allows for very --

25

very little relief.

1

MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Very

2

few cases would -- would have a retroactivity decision

3

within a year of initial recognition.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

5

argument in your favor?

6

MS. BERGMANN:

And why is that an

The -- it would -- the argument

7

is in my favor, Your Honor, because this Court should not

8

read acts of Congress in a manner that would render them

9

absurd.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, to say that it

11

doesn't grant as much relief as it might have doesn't

12

render the statute absurd.

13

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, in -- in this case, Your

14

Honor, it does in two ways.

15

that it would allow has only occurred, in my estimation,

16

once in the post-Teague world since 1989 when Teague v.

17

Lane was decided, and the only other instance would be

18

when this Court would find a right is both -- initially

19

recognize a right and find that right retroactive in the

20

same case, which in my understanding --

21

It does because the relief

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, we've had very few

22

instances in recent years I think where this Court has

23

found some right to be retroactive.

24

MS. BERGMANN:

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So it just doesn't happen

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

very often to begin with.

2

MS. BERGMANN:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

MS. BERGMANN:

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

would basically be --

7
8

And it would be further

limited if the Government's position is adopted here.

5
6

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But it doesn't happen

anyway -MS. BERGMANN:

It -- it does not --

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MS. BERGMANN:

-- very often.

It does not happen very often,

12

Your Honor, but there have been several instances.

13

situation in Bousley where the Court found that the rights

14

in Bailey applied retroactively.

15

would consider the Court's recent decision in Atkins v.

16

Virginia would apply retroactively in light of this

17

Court's earlier decision in Penry v. Lynaugh.

18

indeed, happen and because it happens and because the

19

rights involved in those types cases are so important --

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The

I think most people

So it does,

How -- how do we read this

21

statute concerning what court may find the retroactivity?

22

It's not limited, I assume, under either your view or the

23

Government's to a finding by this Court, a determination

24

that it's retroactive.

25

MS. BERGMANN:

That's -- that's correct, Your

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor.

2

retroactivity decision as well, and that's because of --

3

The parties agree that a lower court can make the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And it could be a court in

4

another circuit presumably if you're in the Federal

5

system.

6

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I would argue

7

that it would have to be a court in the -- in the circuit

8

in which the prisoner would be filing the 2255 motion

9

because that --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MS. BERGMANN:

Why?
Why?

Because that court would have

13

jurisdiction over the proceedings in his case and it would

14

be an adequate way of providing notice to that litigant.

15

It -- a decision of another --

16
17
18
19
20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I guess a litigant can

read decisions from other courts, as a lawyer can.
MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

they would have no precedential effect in his case.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why shouldn't the

21

litigant be put on notice by a district court decision?

22

Let's assume it's in his own circuit.

23

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, a district

24

court decision would have no precedential value with

25

respect to -- would not bind other district courts in that

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

district and therefore not bind other litigants.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well -But there's -- there's just

4

nothing in the statute that says what level court it has

5

to be.

6

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, actually, Your Honor, the

7

statute does say that the ruling would have to be made

8

retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.

9

It does not say a case.

And a decision of a district

10

court would make that retroactivity applicable only to one

11

case not to cases.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, but that may be

just a generic use of the term cases.

14

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, it could be, Your Honor,

15

but I -- Congress included the language.

16

Court could give meaning to it by interpreting the statute

17

to mean that you would be looking at a decision of the

18

court of appeals rather than a decision from a district

19

court.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think this

Of course, if -- if you said a

21

district court, one district judge could -- could trigger

22

the thing for the whole country.

23

MS. BERGMANN:

That --

It would be very complicated,

24

Your Honor, given the fact that district courts often

25

issue rulings in unpublished decisions as well.

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So look at the trouble we get

3

into when we take your interpretation.

4

the Government's interpretation and think only of first

5

habeas.

6

if it were only first habeas and those were all the

7

habeases in the world, wouldn't theirs be better?

8

prisoner would know that when you get the right, you file.

9

Okay, no problem.

Suppose we take

Leave second habeas out of it for a moment.

if, you get a court to say it was retroactive.

11

fine.

12

file within a year.

13

were only first habeases.

We all know.

So that's

All the prisoners know we've got to
It would cause no problem if there

MS. BERGMANN:

If there were only first habeas,

15

Your Honor, and if the lower courts always made the

16

correct retroactivity --

17

Every

And you're going to win if, and only

10

14

But

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

They sometimes don't, but

18

then if they don't, you appeal, just like anything else.

19

And you might lose and you might not get your case taken

20

in the Supreme Court.

21

litigant.

That's always true for every

22

MS. BERGMANN:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

Is there any other problem?

25

MS. BERGMANN:

That's -So -- so that's a problem.

Well, Your Honor, there is also a

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

problem which the Government actually concedes --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. BERGMANN:

What?
-- which is if you read the

4

statutory language of the second clause as being stated in

5

the past tense, and the initial -- and the statute of

6

limitations begins to run with initial recognition, it --

7

it doesn't respect Congress' intent to provide a 1-year

8

limitation period.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but that's -- that's

10

linguistic.

11

prisoners, which was your initial argument.

12

respect to a practical problem for a prisoner, I couldn't

13

think of one, and that's why I'm asking.

14

first habeases.

I'm -- I'm looking for practical problems for
And in

In respect to

15

MS. BERGMANN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

Then if your only problem is second habeas,

With respect to first habeases.
All right.

18

there I'd agree with you.

19

says here the date on which the right asserted was

20

initially recognized.

21

habeas doesn't have a right until the Supreme Court has

22

made the -- the rule retroactive.

23

the Supreme Court makes it retroactive, there was no right

24

recognized for a second habeas person.

25

that case it does begin to run when the Supreme Court says

There's a big problem.

But it

Now, I guess a person who's filed a

And therefore, until

And therefore, for

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it's retroactive because prior to that he had no right --

2

MS. BERGMANN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor --- given -- given paragraph 8.
The -- the same would be true

5

though, Your Honor, then for initial motions that there

6

would be no right available unless a court at some point

7

had held the right applied retroactively to collateral

8

cases because under Teague v. Lane, there is no right to

9

collateral relief simply based on the decision of this

10

Court unless that decision has also been held

11

retroactively applicable.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's all -- the word

13

right in (3) quite plainly doesn't cover the last six

14

words of the -- of the sentence.

15

right -- I'm trying to fix it up.

16

out --

17

MS. BERGMANN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19
20

Well, whether the word
I'm trying to figure

Yes, I understand that.
-- how do we get to that

conclusion.
Now, it seems to me what you've done is say

21

either use my ad hoc mechanism, or let there be chaos, or

22

we take your approach which produces the kind of chaos

23

we've just been discussing.

24
25

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I agree with --

that -- that this is not the best drafted statute that

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress has ever come up with, but I think that

2

respecting Congress' use of verb tense and this Court's

3

decision in Tyler v. Cain, to read paragraph 8(2) and

4

paragraph 6(3) together, that -- that it's important that

5

all three of the prerequisites in the statute have been

6

met before the limitation period begins to run.

7

Otherwise --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why -- why is that important,

given what this petitioner did himself?

He didn't wait

10

for there to be a retroactivity decision to file the 2255

11

motion.

12

decided.

He filed the 2255 motion before the Ross case was
Isn't that right?

13

MS. BERGMANN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So perfectly -- the -- the

15

prisoner is perfectly able to file the 2255 motion after

16

the first clause is satisfied, the date on which the right

17

asserted was initially recognized.

18

late, if you measured the year from that right but he

19

wasn't -- he wasn't waiting for any retroactivity

20

decision.

21

This movant was too

He filed before the retroactivity case.
MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

22

was early under our interpretation --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He

So on your view of it, his

24

complaint, when it was filed, should have been dismissed

25

as not ripe because he didn't have the final element --

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BERGMANN:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3
4

That's --- that is, the

retroactivity?
MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

At

5

the time he filed, there had not been a retroactivity

6

decision on which he could rely.

7

litigation in the district court, the Eleventh Circuit

8

decided the Ross case, and at that point, his right to

9

relief became ripe and the -- and he then had a window

10
11

During the course of

open under paragraph 6(3), such as he could file timely.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Of course, if we're -- if -- if

12

admittedly, as Justice Breyer said, we're trying to figure

13

out some way to make this work in circumstances in which

14

it's -- it's never going to work smoothly, I suppose one

15

answer would be to take the Government's position and say

16

you've -- your -- your year runs from the moment the right

17

is recognized, but to the -- to the extent that there is a

18

retroactivity question, a -- a court should simply stay

19

the proceeding, hold it in abeyance to see whether,

20

particularly in -- in second habeas where you have the --

21

the second petition where you have the problem, to see

22

whether some court will, in fact, recognize retroactivity

23

or whether the -- your circuit will recognize

24

retroactivity.

25

Then if it does, then you can go forward.

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, the problem with that, Your

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor, is that it -- it encourages, as the Government's

2

rule in general does -- encourages numerous frivolous

3

filings.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, there's no question there's

5

a Rube Goldberg character of the whole thing, I -- I

6

realize.

7

the second habeas problem and still accepting the

8

Government's position on the -- on the date at which the

9

-- the 1 year for filing starts.

10

But -- but that would be a way of -- of solving

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, a procedure that the

11

Seventh Circuit has adopted -- and the Seventh Circuit

12

agrees with -- with Mr. Dodd's interpretation of the

13

statute that it begins to run with the retroactivity

14

decision.

15

to review the case on the merits, and if they feel that

16

the motion would lose on the merits, they dismiss it with

17

prejudice, and if they feel there's some viable claim

18

being stated, then they dismiss it without prejudice to

19

refiling at a later time.

Their solution for these premature filings is

That's --

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

potentially violate the 1-year limit.

22

necessarily work.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MS. BERGMANN:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It would -- it would
That won't

Well -I mean, it's a very odd

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

statute.

2
3
4
5

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It's

very odd.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you don't know who's

responsible for writing this, do you?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. BERGMANN:

Actually my understanding is that

8

much of it was written by the Attorney General in

9

California at the time.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can -- do you understand the

11

-- the difference between what is a right initially

12

recognized and then what is a right newly recognized?

13

statute is supposed to have three requirements:

14

recognized, newly recognized, and made retroactive.

15

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

initially

My

16

understanding of when a right is newly recognized is -- is

17

when it is new in the sense that this Court has adopted

18

under Teague v. Lane, that it's not dictated by prior

19

precedent.

20

Court but not new in the Teague sense.

21

A right can be initially recognized by this

JUSTICE BREYER:

Actually Justice Souter's

22

approach might work here because you -- you -- all the

23

second habeases file immediately.

24

Circuit, you say, well, gets to those second habeases

25

right away, and it says dismissed.

Now, the Seventh

Very well.

When they

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

say dismissed, then they ask for cert.

2

for cert, we take or we don't.

out of luck.

4

other cases waiting to see what we decide.

5

wouldn't lose out in any case where we really were going

6

to make it collaterally -- applicable on collateral

review.

8
9

And when they ask

If we don't, then they're

And if we take it, people would hold all the

MS. BERGMANN:

So they

But then, Your Honor, you run up

against your decision in Tyler v. Cain, and that was the

10

circumstance of the litigant in Tyler v. Cain.

11

Court had not previously determined that the right at

12

issue in Tyler v. Cain was retroactively applicable, and

13

under the second or successive statute that -- in the way

14

the Court read this, the Court said that this Court could

15

not determine the retroactivity of, I believe it was, Cage

16

v. Louisiana in that very case because it was contrary to

17

the language in the statute.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No -- this

I mean, I'm sure my dissent was

correct in that case, but the --

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. BERGMANN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
The -- the -- still -- it still

23

would work because the first case has come down.

24

The first case has come down.

25

about these cases, and even if they've already filed a

Okay?

Now all the prisoners read

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

habeas, they go file another.

2

you say, then looks at that first one that they get to,

3

and they say, dismissed.

4

And the Seventh Circuit,

Oh, you're saying that then he comes he here and

5

we say the reason you lose is not because you're wrong.

6

The reason you lose is because you're not yet ripe.

7

MS. BERGMANN:

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

8

What Congress appears to have intended in this -- in this

9

statute, as -- as much as anyone can tell, is that

10

retroactivity decisions be -- be litigated in cases that

11

are brought under paragraph 6(1) which is those cases that

12

are within a -- a year of when the judgment of conviction

13

became final.

14

That's exactly what happened here.

And the Ross case that litigated the question of

15

the retroactivity of Richardson, that was a case brought

16

under paragraph 6(1).

17

his judgment of conviction became final, and -- and the

18

issue of retroactivity was -- was litigated straight and

19

up in that case.

20

Mr. Ross was within a year of when

And what it appears that Congress intended was

21

that very circumstance to happen in all cases, that the

22

retroactivity of decisions of this Court be litigated in

23

cases brought within a year of finality, and then once

24

those decisions were made, then litigants under paragraph

25

6(3) would have the opportunity to file when a court of

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

appeals issued a retroactivity ruling.

2

under paragraph 8(2) would have a -- the ability to

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then litigants

5

able to deal with it.

who are trying to file second habeases, and if you decide

8

retroactivity, collateral, all of them but me will be able

9

to proceed.

That person files his petition for

He puts in the petition there are 4,000 prisoners

But you have to have enough sense, Supreme

10

Court, to take my case to decide if you're going to decide

11

retroactivity, that it is and give me the benefit of the

12

decision.

13

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, then, Your Honor, I guess

14

the Court would have to -- to totally reconsider its

15

decision in Tyler v. Cain to reach that conclusion.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The problem with your

3

argument, Ms. Bergmann, seems to be addressed to the idea

4

that Congress intended to sweep quite broadly here.

5

don't think that's the necessary inference at all.

6

dealing with a situation, as Justice O'Connor points out,

7

where we have very rarely held that a decision is

8

retroactive.

9

and the Government's view makes it an even smaller class

But I
We're

So it's already a very small class of cases,

10

of cases.

11

It just means it doesn't work for a lot of people who are

12

excluded from it.

13

But that doesn't mean the statute doesn't work.

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I agree

14

that this involves a very small class of cases.

15

problem with the Government's reading is that they say

16

that they are narrowly constricting the statute, but the

17

procedural mechanism that they set up allows for a vast

18

number of cases that would never fall within the statute

19

of limitations to be filed and requires the court to deal

20

with each and every one of those cases in the first

21

instance.

22

The

Whereas, my reading of statute has the benefit

23

of allowing a -- a test case to proceed.

24

that there are very few number of these rights that are

25

made retroactively applicable, it -- it makes more sense

Given the fact

18
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in terms of judicial resources to allow there to be this

2

situation where is -- there is a test case --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But on your theory, there

4

wouldn't be much in the way of resources because you say

5

there's no ripe claim until the retroactivity decision

6

comes down.

7

this dilemma, simply say, well, I'll just hold this

8

complaint until the -- the court of appeals or the Supreme

9

Court rules on retroactivity?

10

Why wouldn't a district judge, faced with

MS. BERGMANN:

Well, certainly the district

11

courts would do that.

12

action would probably be to find the motion at that point

13

untimely because it does not fall within any of the -- it

14

-- if it is outside the initial year from finality but

15

doesn't fall within any of the other exceptions stated in

16

paragraph 6, then it -- it would be untimely and the court

17

could dismiss it as such.

18

The more appropriate course of

I mean, by doing so, if the court dismisses it,

19

it could well count as a first motion so that any motion

20

filed thereafter would be a second or successive motion.

21

And this would be -- preclude litigants from filing

22

prematurely and burdening the courts with premature

23

filings until it is clear they have a cause of action.

24
25

I mean, what's strange about the Government's
reading of the statute is that they believe Congress

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

intended for a limitations period to begin to run before

2

the litigant had any right to relief.

3

to relief in the collateral proceeding until the right at

4

issue has been made retroactively applicable to collateral

5

cases.

6

of limitations and the cause of action creates this

7

problem where people will be -- feel compelled to file

8

protective motions.

9

No one has a right

And so that this kind of disjoinder of the statute

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

The

10

words, made retroactively applicable to cases on

11

collateral review, don't have a modifier such as telling

12

us by whom it's made retroactive.

13

considered what seems to me a fairly normal reading that

14

the -- the words, by the Supreme Court, should apply to

15

that phrase as well as the preceding language?

16

MS. BERGMANN:

Has any court

Well, actually, Your Honor, every

17

lower court to consider the language has found that the

18

retroactivity decision need not be made by this Court, and

19

the reason for that is the difference between the language

20

in paragraph 6(3) and in the second or successive

21

provision in paragraph 8(2).

22

explicitly states that it has to be made retroactive to

23

cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In paragraph 8(2), it

It seems to me that cuts in

the other direction, that when Congress thought about the

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

entity that makes it retroactive, they thought about us.

2

And that's why -- and that's the only language that seems

3

to fit.

4

that concept.

I mean, the by the Supreme Court seems to fit

5

MS. BERGMANN:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7
8
9

If -- if you apply -But I guess nobody has come up

with this suggestion other than this question.
MS. BERGMANN:

Well, various lower courts have

considered that possibility and have latched onto the

10

different -- differences in language where paragraph 8(2)

11

explicitly states it has to be made by the Supreme Court,

12

but paragraph 6(3) says it does not.

13

below said the same thing, and the parties agree that the

14

retroactivity decision need not be made by this Court.

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And -- and the court

Well, if we disagree and

16

think it should be, I guess that would open a door down

17

the road for people after this Court made such a

18

determination.

19

MS. BERGMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

would make paragraph 6(3) much more consistent with

21

paragraph 8(2), if -- if the --

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

MS. BERGMANN:

It

Yes.

But again, it would work only if

24

the 1-year period began to run from this Court's

25

retroactivity decision.

If it begins to run from initial

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

recognition, then that would turn paragraph 6(3) into an

2

absolute nullity because I know of no case where this

3

Court has made a retroactivity decision within a year of

4

when it initially recognizes a right.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that fits the language,

6

the date on which the right was initially recognized by

7

the Supreme Court if and only if it's been made

8

retroactively by the Supreme Court.

9

normal reading of the language.

10

But nobody else agrees

with it.

11

MS. BERGMANN:

12

has -- has agreed with thus far.

13

It seems to me a very

-- now -- now, I'm jumping to that because it sounds like

it might be good.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Would you address that last

suggestion first, Mr. Feldman?
MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure I completely held it

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It was very --

Our basic position is -Well, to -- to interpret as

4

meaning only this Court could make the retroactivity

5

determination and the 1 year wouldn't run until and unless

6

there was a new rule and subsequently in whatever case

7

this Court said it was retroactive.

8
9

MR. FELDMAN:
that.

I -- I have two comments about

That was a position which actually a footnote in

10

our brief in Tyler against Cain I think suggested,

11

although that wasn't the issue before the Court in that

12

case.

13

number of courts of appeals and district courts, and as

14

far as I'm aware, no court has accepted that.

15

reason they haven't --

But since that time, this has been litigated in a

16
17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. FELDMAN:

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

Well, that's true, but I

assume it is, nonetheless, open for us to do so --

18

20

And the

correct.

Yes.
-- if we thought it was

What is your view?
MR. FELDMAN:

It would be, but I think we came

22

to the conclusion that it probably wasn't because the

23

words, by the Supreme Court, are not only present in two

24

different places right in this paragraph 6(3), also in

25

8(2), also in 2244 and in 22 -- I think -- 64.

And it

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

does seem to be a pattern that where the Congress expected

2

a decision by this Court in the whole series of statutes,

3

they said, by the Supreme Court.

4

from the phrase that says, made retroactive to cases on

5

collateral review.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it's notably missing

It is noticeably missing

7

because it -- it has a blank there and the words, by the

8

Supreme Court, are the only time limitation in that whole

9

provision after the word if.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

It -- that -- it -- what it says

11

-- it says newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made

12

retroactive.

13

the rationale the courts have used.

It doesn't say by the Supreme Court.

14

But if I could move to the --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

But if you don't -- aren't -- I

16

mean,

17

virtue of this -- suddenly it's like tinkers to Everest

18

chance.

19

What was worrying you most about their position was it

20

produced uncertainty, a kind of a mess.

21

which court you're talking about.

22

things all over the place.

23

it's a mess.

24
25

the language is open, and it's sort of like the

I mean, it seems to put everything together.

This stops that.

You don't know

People would be filing

They'll be waiting.

That --

What's worrying them is that

the second habeas person, given Tyler, could never file,

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not even in that -- you know, not even in that -- in that

2

really unusual situation where we're going to make it a

3

collateral review.

4

the certainty, the definiteness of when your time clock

5

begins to tick, and it eliminates all the uncertainty, et

6

cetera, and confusion, difficulty from their position.

7

And now, what this does is it produces

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I think the other -- the

8

other problem that I actually am -- that I think the Court

9

should be worried about is that this statute sets one --

10

it doesn't say anything about the date on which something

11

is made retroactive.

12

four dates and it then sets forth what those dates are.

13

And it says, the date on which the right asserted was

14

initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if certain

15

conditions are satisfied.

16

It says it runs from the later of

Now, that if clause may well raise some -- it

17

does raise, I think, some interpretative issues.

18

however you interpret the if clause, that just tells you

19

whether the petitioner can use that date on which the

20

right was initially recognized or not.

21

it, if the if clause is not satisfied, then he's -- he

22

only has to show he's timely under one of the other three

23

provisions.

24

the conviction became final.

25

But

If he can't use

The normal one is 1 year from the date that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is however you construe the if clause, it can't possibly

2

be read to -- whatever interpretative problems there are

3

there, it can't be possibly be read to alter the totally

4

plain language that Congress --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, it could because you

6

could say what the Congress intended to say.

7

had X, Y, and Z, it shall in that event run from that

8

date.

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

MR. FELDMAN:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

If the right

That's implicit in it.

And it's not -Just like the words, by the

Supreme Court --

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. FELDMAN:

It's not -- it's not --- would be implicit.

-- it doesn't.

But even then,

17

it's not -- it doesn't run from that date, and the -- he's

18

-- and the -- the petitioner has the -- the applicant has

19

no date on -- if he's past his 1 year from the date the

20

conviction became final, he has no date on which he can

21

rely to make his application timely.

22

And our primary submission --

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, on Justice Stevens'

24

analysis, he does not have a date until the retroactivity

25

decision is made, and he has to sit there and wait.

But

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

when the retroactivity decision is made, he's got his

2

date.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

But this statute doesn't -- it's

4

not worded the way the -- the -- paragraph 6 as a whole

5

says you have the later of four dates.

6

different things.

7

the later of any of these things.

8

the condition is satisfied then you -- the question is --

9

okay, the if condition is satisfied.

It names four

It -- it tells you if

I can use paragraph

10

(3).

11

-- 1 year from the date on which the right was initially

12

recognized by the Supreme Court, and that's the date he

13

has.

14

because the appropriate thing doesn't happen till later,

15

then he just can't use that date.

16

possible dates to use under paragraph (6) --

17

What's my time limit?

And it says the date on which

If the -- if -- if it turns out that he can't use it

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He has three other

I -- I follow your linguistic

18

-- Justice Stevens follows the linguistic analysis.

19

think the question that he's raising, the question I'm

20

raising is, do we have a good reason here to doubt that

21

the linguistic analysis is getting us to -- to what

22

Congress would have intended?

23

I

The proposed good reason or the best reason I

24

think is that if we read it your way, then as Justice

25

Breyer said in Tyler, as a practical matter, second habeas

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is -- is -- a second habeas petitioner is -- is almost

2

never going to -- or probably, in fact, never will get the

3

benefit of the new rule.

4

is, so what.

5

Well, maybe one answer to that

The reason that cannot be dismissed, I think,

6

that way is this.

7

under our rules often make a new rule retroactive, but

8

when we do under the conditions which we impose for that,

9

it's -- it's one humdinger of a rule.

As has been pointed out here, we do not

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it is -- it is unlikely --

12

or at least there's a good argument that it's unlikely --

13

that Congress would have wanted to exclude all the

14

potential second habeas people from it, particularly

15

because they're second habeas people because they got in

16

in time on first habeas.

17

your theory basically they're out of the game on a very

18

important rule.

19

your linguistic analysis may not be pointing to what

20

Congress intended.

21

They played by the rules, and on

So that's the argument for saying that

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I -- I disagree with that.

22

First, on second habeas, the -- this Court, I think all

23

three opinions, in Tyler against Cain recognized that

24

there can be cases where this Court recognizes a new right

25

and it is retroactive at the same time where it's the

29
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

combination of some earlier decision that said all rules

2

of a certain type are retroactive and then in the

3

second --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

6

recognizing a rule of that type.

7

But that is --

-- the Court said we are

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is a highly exceptional

8

case, and the problem with that is -- I mean, if -- if

9

we're going to -- if you're going to be linguistic about

10

it, you'd have to say, well, that really is not very sound

11

reasoning because that is not a holding because the -- you

12

-- you've got not merely to have recognized it under the

13

statute, but you've got to have held it.

14

that's pretty unlikely.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. FELDMAN:

And that's --

It -- it says actually made

retroactive, and I -- all of -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I guess we've said you've

got to do it with -MR. FELDMAN:

-- all three of the opinions in

20

Tyler recognized that that sort of thing can happen, and I

21

think that that actually is by far the most common kind of

22

case because that's likely to be a case where the Court

23

has said, for example, where Teague doesn't apply at all

24

where the Court has narrowed the scope substantially of a

25

Federal criminal statute such as in the Bailey case where

30
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- where the question was whether it has to be active use

2

or mere possession of a firearm.

3

are very possibly, at least if the Court has made it clear

4

that they're narrowing the -- the Court is narrowing the

5

conduct that was thought to be criminal in construing a

6

criminal statute, those are the kinds of cases that are

7

likely to arise most often.

8

is likely to be the kind of the thing the Court was

9

talking about in Tyler against Cain.

10

And those kinds of cases

In those kinds of cases, that

With respect to the other class of cases, which

11

would -- the only other class of retroactive cases would

12

be those that come within the second -- what used to be

13

called the second Teague exception for bedrock principles

14

that have the primacy or centrality of Gideon against

15

Wainwright.

16

that it may be doubted that any such rules remain to -- to

17

be discovered.

18

case of that level of centrality and primacy and

19

importance, I think that this Court and other courts could

20

take steps to decide whatever pending section 2255 motions

21

they have or whatever ones could be filed by someone who

22

still has their 1 year to go from date of finality of

23

conviction to decide those quite quickly because that

24

would be --

25

Now, the Court has suggested -- it has said

But if there were, I think a court of -- a

12

MR. FELDMAN:

said and clarified most recently in the Summerlin case

14

last year is that those -- Teague doesn't apply.

15

an exception to Teague, but Teague doesn't apply because

16

those cases are retroactive without going through a

particular analysis under Teague.

happens, of course, in real life is there's argument about

what were -- what -- how was the jury actually instructed.

4

Did the jury find the necessary fact?

5

harmless error because this case was tried on a theory

6

that made it totally clear that he did commit the crime

even as narrowed by this Court and those kinds of

The fact that the Government is

then you should get it.

MR. FELDMAN:

But where the event that you're

5

relying on for tolling would be an event that is

6

anticipated in the statute and would be across the board

7

and would really have nothing to do with the particular

8

conduct of the petitioner's case, but whether someone else

9

has gone and gotten a retroactivity ruling, I think it

10

would be unprecedented in those circumstances to just

11

rewrite the statute to come to a different date than what

12

Congress had set.

Congress set the date on which the

you back to the issue of whether the Court that recognizes

18

there are three other instances in which it is specified

19

that it be the Supreme Court, and it's not specified here.

20

But does any of those other three instances involve

21

language like this which -- which has the Supreme Court

22

mentioned immediately previously?

that newly recognized it made it retroactively applicable.

Is -- is any of the other ones phrased this way so that

the word, the Supreme Court, is immediately preceding the

MR. FELDMAN:

You know, I'd -- I'd have to look

at the -- I can tell you where the statutes are.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

The other is in 2244 which I think

is worded exactly the same as this is.

specific wording of each of those.

The proximity of the reference

1

word Supreme Court right before and the absence of the

2

words, the Supreme Court, here and the presence of the

3

Supreme Court in the first one -- you could certainly draw

4

the inference that this was not something -- this part of

5

it didn't have to be made by the Supreme Court.

6

perhaps Congress was recognizing that it -- it does take

7

this Court a longer time to reach a retroactivity decision

8

than it would take the lower courts hearing cases.

9

Once --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

Is there anything in any of

11

these statutes or legislative history or any -- anyplace

12

else where Congress ever thought of the possibility that

13

some other court might make a new rule retroactive?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think there's any

15

statement one way or another, but I do think there are

16

holdings.

17

relies on by the Eleventh --

18

There are holdings as -- as the petitioner

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think the other reading is

19

-- the assumption was -- and I think it's incorrect --

20

that we would simultaneously identify the new right and

21

decide it is or is not retroactive.

22

assumption I think.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

That was the

I -- I just -- I think that would

24

be unlikely because this Court's practice has certainly

not since Teague and even going decades before Teague --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

I realize it's wrong, but

2

I think that's probably the assumption Congress made.

3

That's what I'm suggesting.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I guess I -- I would just

5

think it's unlikely because although this statute has some

6

drafting -- it certainly raises some drafting issues, I

7

think they likely -- that basic element of this Court's

8

retroactivity jurisprudence, which has been true for

9

decades, I think likely --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, the only thing about your

11

reading of the statute that troubles me is you're --

12

you're reading the word only.

13

but only if Congress -- the Supreme Court has already done

14

the next two things.

15
16

MR. FELDMAN:
If is a condition.

1 year is the maximum.
Just -- I'm reading it has an if.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

There's an only --

What if does is states a

condition.

20
21

If it's a 1-year statute,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not an if, but if that

happens, then it shall be --

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, because Congress didn't say

23

it.

-- the 6(3) as a whole and said it shall it run from the

25

If Congress had phrased this the way it phrased the

holds it -- recognizes the right or the date it holds it

2

retroactive, that would have -- that would have been --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. FELDMAN:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, it really --

-- that would have --- would accomplish your

6

objective if you just struck the whole clause after the

7

word if.

8
9

You don't really need that.
MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think so.

I think

what the clause does is it makes it clear that in 6(3),

10

which is a -- you know, intended to be a narrow exception

11

from the -- the rule of finality -- that in 6(3) what

12

Congress was doing was saying this is the only class of

13

cases that we want this to apply to.

14

said the date on which the right was initially recognized

15

by the Supreme Court, I think there might have been some

16

inference that they were not -- they were trying to extend

17

that beyond cases that are retroactive under Teague, or

18

perhaps someone might have read that and said, you know,

19

Teague is no longer applicable.

20

standard that it's enacted here.

21

And if they had just

Now Congress has a new

And I think Congress wanted make clear -- the

22

people who drafted this -- that that was not what they

23

were trying to do.

24

it has been newly recognized and made retroactive to cases

25

on collateral review, what they were plainly referring to

And by saying made retroactive -- if

40
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was this Court's jurisprudence under Teague so that no one

2

would think this deadline is supposed to somehow open the

3

door to cases that would otherwise be barred by Teague.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what courts in -- in

5

your view have to make the retroactivity finding?

6

district court?

7

jurisdiction over his case?

8
9

The

The circuit where he's -- which has

MR. FELDMAN:

Any circuit?

I think every court that has

addressed that question has come to the conclusion that it

10

can be -- it has to be the circuit with territorial

11

jurisdiction over the applicant's case.

12

the jurisdiction of courts of appeals and the area in

13

which their rulings are effective.

14

That's generally

It also could be, in our view, the district

15

court that's hearing the particular defendant's case

16

because that's --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it's not that -- if it

18

isn't the district court in that case, then you -- the

19

district court has to take this complaint and just freeze

20

it until some other -- a higher court rules on it.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

I don't see any -- I don't

22

think that that would be the appropriate thing to do.

23

think if -- if the view was that this had to -- it

24

couldn't be filed until a court with jurisdiction over the

25

case had actually held that the right was retroactive,

I

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

then I think the correct course for the district court

2

would be to dismiss it because it's -- it's not -- it's

3

not a timely petition.

4

there's -- it's -- we're assuming 1 year past the date

5

that the conviction became final, and there's no other

6

provision at that point that can render it timely.

7

that point, the correct course for the district court

8

would be just to dismiss it.

9

At the time when it's filed,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And at

So that if 10 other circuits

10

have ruled on this but not his own, there's nothing he can

11

do until somebody within the 1-year window files.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

Our view -- well, that -- that --

13

if -- if the -- the made retroactive has to occur before

14

he files, that would be the consequence.

15

it can be made retroactive in his own case, and therefore,

16

anyone can file.

17

when a new right is recognized, and if in their own case

18

it's held to be retroactive, then they were timely and

19

they may well get relief depending --

But our view is

They have a 1-year window from the time

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. FELDMAN:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MR. FELDMAN:

So far as first habe goes.

So far as first habeas goes.
Second habe, he's out cold.

I -- I think that it's -- I don't

24

-- second habeas is definitely a narrower window, and I

25

think Congress intended it to be a narrower window.

But

42
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the reasons I said, there are decisions where the

2

Court holds -- where this Court recognizes, in effect, the

3

retroactivity of a new rule at the same time as it

4

announces it, as the Court said in Tyler.

5

-- this Court and lower courts can act quickly on these

6

kinds of things.

7

the primacy and centrality of Gideon against Wainwright

8

came up, I think the lower courts would see we have to act

9

very quickly on this.

10

And there are

If the kind of bedrock principle with

I -- one point of note is that Richardson

11

itself, which the Government doesn't believe is

12

retroactive, but that's not before the Court here -- the

13

first decision holding Richardson retroactive came down 7

14

months after this Court decided Richardson.

15

and that was where no one was thinking they had to

16

particularly rush on that.

17

The second --

But if this Court were to recognize a new right

18

under -- a -- a new right that satisfied the second Teague

19

exception, I think it can be expected because it would

20

necessarily be -- have a certain primacy and centrality

21

and sweep that there would probably be cases pending in

22

the courts of appeals, in the district courts raising that

23

issue, and I think the courts involved, if they -- this

24

Court said, look, this is -- this is the way the thing has

25

to be understood in accordance with --

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it would do -- let's take

2

a case which I guess we -- Apprendi.

3

Apprendi, a big sort of an issue in the courts.

4

and this would put tremendous pressure on us to decide it

5

immediately, wouldn't it?

6

whether it was going to be retroactive or not retroactive

7

because it's only likely to come along in some major,

8

major matter like that, other than the kind Justice

9

Kennedy said, which is another kind of problem.

10

I mean, you know,
And --

We'd have to say immediately

I mean, I don't see a way, if we take your

11

approach, of getting out of this tremendous pressure.

12

Maybe it would be a good thing.

13

a way of getting out of it.

14

MR. FELDMAN:

But I don't think there's

I think this Court has -- has to

15

take cases and plan its docket in accordance with a wide

16

variety of considerations and that may be something that

17

the Court would want to take into consideration.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what do you think about

19

the -- it seems to me we've tried three approaches, each

20

of which try to get us out of this problem of the

21

pressure, call it.

22

-- but there were certain problems with Justice Souter's,

23

which still I'm not certain might -- then I had started

24

with one that I guess the objection to it would be it's

25

laughable.

And we have Justice Stevens' and then

that really that just goes too far.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is

I -- I -But is there any other

objection?
MR. FELDMAN:

I think essentially the same one,

that -- that they use the term right in 6 and they didn't

10

intend that term to mean something different, whether it

11

was a first habeas or a second habeas.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

MR. FELDMAN:

14
15

May I ask you --

They were talking about the right

that was asserted.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you this question?

16

Isn't it true that under some of the other references they

17

refer to a constitutional right?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's right.

That's another --

Whereas this just refers to a

20

right and it includes statutory rights.

21

the odd thing about that is that normally when we construe

22

a statute, we say it always meant that.

23

not a new right in the sense as a right as of the date of

24

enactment.

25

MR. FELDMAN:

And, of course,

It's not -- it's

1
2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the difference between the

Constitution and statutes sometimes is rather significant.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

In paragraph 8(2) only --

4

only -- it does require a constitutional right.

5

in 6(3) it refers just to right.

6

would, I think, encompass the class of cases such as

7

Bailey where this Court interprets a Federal statute and

8

narrows it and makes conduct that was thought to violate

9

the statute earlier -- it means that conduct no longer

But in --

But, as I said, that

10

violates it.

11

if the Court has made those points clear, if that clearly

12

is what this Court decided, those cases may well be

13

retroactive at the time they're announced under the

14

rationale that all the opinions in Tyler against Cain

15

accepted.

16

Those kinds of decisions may well under --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Feldman, is there any case

17

in which the Supreme Court newly recognizes a right in

18

which it does not initially recognize the right?

19
20
21

MR. FELDMAN:

I think there's sound -- those

seem to me to be synonymous and -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they're -- they're -- I

22

thought your position was newly recognized means that it

existed before.

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

But I think

2

initially recognizing may well be another way of saying

3

the same thing.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Every -- every newly recognized

5

is an -- is an initially recognized, although every

6

initially recognized is not necessarily a newly

7

recognized.

9

Is that it?

MR. FELDMAN:

I was actually thinking of it the

other way around.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. FELDMAN:

don't.

But I think the point of the newly -- in fact,

20

if you look at -- if you kind of flip it, the point of

21

this provision can -- maybe becomes a little bit clearer.

22

It's if -- if you start with the if, if the petition is

23

based on a right that is newly recognized and made

retroactive to cases on collateral review, that's the

class.

Wouldn't that have been a more --

I would definitely agree with that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

principal argument that Ms. Bergmann made was your reading

answers to that.

MR. FELDMAN:

But -- and which -- many of which

may be quite easy to -- to dismiss.

6

But I would say Ms. Bergmann's reading has a

7

kind of -- the opposite problem with it, which is under

8

her reading the -- no one -- when a court holds something

9

retroactive can -- is an unpredictable matter.

And under

10

her reading, nobody -- even where there's a right that's

11

rather important and that should be retroactive, no one

12

could get relief until an appropriate court has held it

13

retroactive, which could take years.

14

And if the Court -- and I think that that reading of that

15

-- therefore, I think that that -- that reading has just

16

the opposite problem.

degree.

15

acquittal because you can't find the witnesses or you can

16

no longer prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

17

think, therefore, Congress said, all right, well if

18

there's a new right, that's a sufficiently exceptional

19

circumstance, that we can suspend that finality for a

20

brief period, but 1 year and that's all.

21

shouldn't come out 10 years later or 15 years later or

22

20 years later.

23

And there's a

purpose.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your -- your position is

5

strengthened by the other three provisions of the statute

that mentioned this, but it's not controlled by that, I

7

take it.

it's read on its own.

9

You think it's unambiguous just as it read -- as

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that the date -- there's

10

only one possible date that can be found in this language.

11

Unless the Court felt that it had to completely rewrite

12

it, there's only one date, the date on which the right

13

asserted was initially recognized by this Court.

14

if -- whatever problems the if clause have -- has, that

15

may mean that this -- not very many people -- the worst it

16

would mean is that not many people can take advantage of

17

that date.

18

And even

But unless it's -- that date is -- there's

19

something unconstitutional, which no one has suggested,

20

about Congress picking that date and that limitations

21

period for people who have had the chance to litigate

22

things on direct review -- in any event, it had 1 year

23

from the date their conviction became final.

24

there's something wrong with that, I think that the Court

25

should follow the terms of the statute, and the time

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. BERGMANN:

9

I'd like to start with the last point that Mr.

Just several quick points.

10

Feldman made saying that there is only possible date under

11

which the limitation period can run and -- and cautioning

12

the Court about rewriting that date.

13

neglects to mention is that it's asking this Court to

14

rewrite the if clause by changing Congress' use of verb

15

tense from a past tense to -- to something that could

16

happen in the future.

17

language contrary to Tyler, contrary to the use of verb

18

tense and allow a district court to make a retroactivity

19

decision at some time in the future in every case in which

20

a motion is filed under paragraph 6(3).

21

What the Government

They want this Court to read that

The second point I'd like to make is that the --

22

in situations such as this that involve these kinds of

23

important rights, interests in finality are at an ebb.

24

These are the types of rights where someone may well be

25

innocent of the crime for which they are incarcerated,

52
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

that involve important rights that go to the accuracy of

2

the underlying adjudication.

3

circumstances, there is -- it is a situation where

4

Congress' need or -- or the need of the courts to enforce

5

finality to keep people in jail are at their lowest point.

6

These are very special rights and Congress went to the

7

trouble of drafting and enacting paragraph 6(3) and

8

paragraph 8(2) to protect these rights.

9

think the Court should read them as broadly as possible in

There are circumstances where a -- let me see if

I can get this right -- where a -- a right may be newly

recognized but not yet initially recognized.

recognizes rights, but then later on determines that they

are not new, that they are indeed old.

Simmons v. South Carolina.

17

recognized a right to present certain types of mitigation

evidence in the penalty phase of a capital case, but then

the Court later determined that that was not a new right.

20

It was an old right in the Teague sense, and so it,

therefore, applied retroactively because it was an old

right but it did not newly recognize it at the time that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm laughing at the statute,

not at you.

3

MS. BERGMANN:

4

I just wanted to say in closing that -- that it

Thank you, Your Honor.

5

is a difficult statute, but I think that Mr. Dodd's

6

interpretation of the statute best respects Congress' use

7

of tense and is consistent with the reading of paragraph

8

8(2) that this Court gave in Tyler.

9

It also respects Congress' intention to create a

10

specific exception for new rights that apply retroactively

11

and by allowing for the realistic possibility of -- of

12

success in either an initial or a second or successive

13

motion premised on such rights.

14

It also, as we've discussed, promotes judicial

15

efficiency by eliminating from it frivolous motions

16

because litigants would not file until it was clear that

17

they actually had a right to collateral relief.

In sum, this Court should conclude that the
