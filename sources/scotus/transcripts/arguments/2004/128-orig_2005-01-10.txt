ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. FRANKLIN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Because title to lands underlying navigable

11

waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty,

12

this Court has long held that there is a strong

13

presumption that each State receives title to such lands

14

at statehood.

15

States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has

16

definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise

17

made that intention very plain.

18

Under the Court's precedents, the United

Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case,

19

the United States asserts that it received title to the

20

submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there

21

is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by

22

Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.

23

To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of

24

the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the

25

United States identifies as ratifying the purported

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains

2

with Alaska.

3

proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would

4

otherwise have been transferred to the State under the

5

main clause.

6

undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special

7

Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included

8

within the main clause.

9

did not --

10

Under the plain language of the statute, the

And this is important.

In this case it is

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, counsel, you --

11

apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the

12

uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section

MR. FRANKLIN:

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- of the statehood act.

Absolutely.
And why was Federal title to

18

the monument not sufficient to retain title to the

19

submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e)

20

at all?

21

MR. FRANKLIN:

Because of section 6(m), Your

22

Honor.

23

that the Federal Government retained all of the property

24

it previously possessed with one important exception,

25

except as provided in section 6.

Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides

Section 6 has two

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here.

2

Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and

3

thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all

4

the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus

5

those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put

6

Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the

7

States.

8
9

Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different
set of properties.

What section 6(e) did was to transfer

10

to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of

11

property, property that was used for the purposes or

12

solely -- for the sole purpose of -- of fish and wildlife

13

conservation under three designated statutes.

14

the State -- local-State fish and wildlife conservation

15

statutes.

16

Those are

Again, here it was -- it is undisputed that

17

Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause.

18

Therefore, the --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- problem, as -- you just

20

said that -- that the main clause is very, very narrow,

21

and we're told by the Government that no wildlife

22

reservation would come within that main clause, so that

23

there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.

24
25

MR. FRANKLIN:
Honor.

The Government is incorrect, Your

We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai

moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were

2

otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the

3

proviso.

4

And here's why the United States is correct on

5

that.

6

were not included in the main clause because they were

7

created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the

8

Alaska Game Law of 1943.

9

the exact same statute.

They argue in their brief that those properties

In fact, Your Honors, those are
The '43 Alaska Game Law simply

10

restated the 1925 law with certain amendments.

11

means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the

12

Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the

13

purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the

14

then-existing version.

15

prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute.

16

those are two properties.

What that

These refuges were created in 1941
So

17

And -- and actually the legislative history --

18

we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative

19

history because the statute is plain and also because

20

there's a clear statement rule.

21

history does indicate that Congress was specifically

22

concerned about those two very large refuges.

23

and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is

24

approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut.

25

And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern

But the legislative

2

be able adequately to manage those properties.

issue here because it was never going to be transferred to

the State under the main clause.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. FRANKLIN:

We are advocating the tests set

out in the Idaho case, Your Honor.

That test is a two-

pronged test.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

Why -- why shouldn't we look

to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?

11

13

But there

Right.

First, you have to look and see

if there is a -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Whether Congress has notice

15

of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation,

16

which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?

17
18

MR. FRANKLIN:

That's -- that's relevant to the

first prong, Your Honor.

19

The second prong --

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And second, whether the

21

transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that

22

reservation.

23

Should we look to that?

MR. FRANKLIN:

If the Court were examining the

24

-- the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors

25

might be relevant.

Here, though, the test is set out in

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that

is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress.

And Idaho applies that.

some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that

5

case.

Idaho looked very carefully for

Here, we need an action by Congress.

The United

That proviso, though, just does not

cover these lands.

JUSTICE BREYER:

might matter.

MR. FRANKLIN:

It has to be definitely --

Justice Breyer, you're correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I'm correct, then -- if I'm

correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here

something very special about the water, that the water in

I understand that.

But I mean,

it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're

10

giving you the geysers.

I mean, that's water too.

11

even underground water.

But I mean, what the argument I

12

think is -- would be is this like that, and the argument

13

that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need

14

this water in order to study the glaciers because there

15

are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora

16

and fauna can't be protected without it.

good enough.

11

by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel

12

Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national

13

monument off the coast of California, included State-

14

owned submerged lands because even though the reservation

no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the

17

State's title.

In the 1978 California decision decided

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you do that, Mr.

8

Franklin, is -- is the rule that -- that we're operating

9

under that Congress had to have made it clear --

10

MR. FRANKLIN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
-- that it reserved, or is the

12

rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved

13

it?

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

No.

It's the former rule, Your

Honor.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's the former.
Yes.
So the mere fact that it

19

doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not

20

make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?

21

MR. FRANKLIN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Right, but normally you assume,

23

I guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid

24

things that are ridiculous.

I guess the question would be is that included.

There's something called the

California Coastal National Monument.

13

In that monument, the -- the lands, the submerged lands,

are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are

Yes.
What is it that the Government

essential attribute of the -- essential premise for the

13

Court's holding.

14

-- the decision, what the Court made clear is it was

15

concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso,

16

all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would

17

have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was

one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was

covered by the proviso.

At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the

No such concern is present here.

I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I

21

might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count.

22

There the United States asserts that at statehood the

23

waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated

24

enclaves of international high seas that were wholly

25

surrounded by U.S. territorial waters.

The historical

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

record, though, belies that contention.

2

At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States

3

took what this Court has described in the Mississippi

4

Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as

5

the publicly stated policy that the waters of the

6

archipelago were inland and that the political boundary

7

ran along the outside edge.

8

took -- consistently based a discriminatory enforcement

9

regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position.

Thereafter, the United States

What I

10

mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed

11

U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the argument on the other

13

side, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of

14

authority to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant.

15

It has no necessary implication for the historic waters

16

doctrine.

17

What -- what is your answer to that?
MR. FRANKLIN:

That's the assertion.

My answer

18

is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975

19

decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202,

20

and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief.

21

Court said there is it examined an incident in which a

22

Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general

23

area, and the Court said -- and I quote -- that incident

24

deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel

25

more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of

What the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and,

3

waters in question.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

What -- what page was that?
I'm sorry.

That's 201 to 202 --

6

201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of

7

the blue brief.

8
9

What the law was at statehood is that the United
States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce

10

discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign

11

vessels.

12

Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that

13

is that the law has changed.

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

I would like to begin with the focal point of

Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park.

Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the

MR. MINEAR:

I mean, it has

Your Honor, but that's -- it's

someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that

MR. MINEAR:

The instances -- the examples

they're giving are cases in which we've created those

created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is

14

passing by.

15

For all those reasons, the juridical bays here

16

are -- are simply not well founded, and the master was

17

correct in rejecting them.

18

So what we see --

Quite honestly we thought that

under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to

9

create absolutely new -- no new law.

It had already

10

interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e)

11

applied to this case.

12

We think the Idaho provisions provide another

13

opportunity for us to establish it.

14

the purposes of the -- the lands here, the submerged

15

lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply

16

inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those

17

lands to pass out of ownership.

18

However, we relied on --

would -- we would go forward with is that these lands are

3

occupied under a claim of right, and that's another

4

exception under the Submerged Lands Act.

5

One of the theories that we

In addition, we would renew the argument with

6

regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an

7

area and authorizes the President to set it aside under

8

the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be

9

disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's

10

a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain

11

those lands.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, given the absence of a

summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.
MR. MINEAR:

No.

You would not have -- we -- we

believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not

think that he foreclosed it.

17

But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the

18

relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's

19

important and worthwhile.

20

squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in

21

an actual textual basis for showing that the -- the United

States retain those lands.

2

The master agreed with us.

He analyzed the

Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the -- the

4

proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent

5

retention clause.

6

Arctic Coast decision except on that basis.

7

There's no other way to understand the

And we think that's the right interpretation,

8

and we think if we -- if you focus on what the Court said

9

on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear.

The statement

10

that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test

is an afterthought at the end of the opinion.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would -- would you respond to

20

decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?

21

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, my -- my first response is

22

even the master, who ruled -- who -- who decided against

23

us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and

24

indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60

25

and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within

56
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the proviso.

2

Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held

3

that lands that did not fall within the main clause were

4

included by the proviso.

5

Therefore -- excuse me.

The main clause.

It is important, though, to -- to note this,

6

that even if the statute is ambiguous -- and we think that

7

it is not -- Alaska still prevails here because a -- there

8

is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule

9

cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.
