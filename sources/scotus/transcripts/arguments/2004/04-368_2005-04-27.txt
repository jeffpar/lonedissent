CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Arthur Andersen v. United States.
Ms. Mahoney.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Government concedes that the destruction of

11

documents in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crime

12

in the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule that

13

Congress had preserved for over a century.

14

question in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless,

15

intended to make a polite request to engage in that lawful

16

conduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by ten

17

years in prison.

18

interpretation of the statute and to hold that Arthur

19

Andersen did not commit a crime.

20

The central

We ask this Court to reject that

I'd like to turn first to the term "corruptly

21

persuade" as it's used in Section 1512 and explain why

22

Arthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only a

23

reasonable reading, but the best reading of the language

24

in the statute.

25

The first thing that we see when we look at the
3

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

statutory context is that Congress did not prohibit -- did

2

not prohibit -- all persuasion to destroy documents for

3

the specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in

4

an official proceeding.

5

simply say, "Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has

6

violated the statute."

7

limitation, and that is the word "corruptly" -- "corruptly

8

persuades."

9

It did not, because it did not

It added a very important

So what kinds of requests are excluded from the

10

definition?

11

to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding?

12

And the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning

13

of the term "corruptly," is that "corruptly" means that

14

you have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper

15

means, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to

16

violate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the

17

duties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a

18

whole range of statutes that govern the obligations of

19

people in our society.

20

When is it that it's okay to persuade someone

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose you persuaded --

21

and I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded

22

the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a

23

fraud.

24
25

Would that be corrupt?
MS. MAHONEY:

If -- Your Honor, if it was a

crime, then, yes -4

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in order to -- let's say

2

it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and

3

you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to

4

conceal the fraud.

5

MS. MAHONEY:

Okay, if this is in a -- in the

6

course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to

7

be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by

8

Section 1512.

9

let's assume that you know that a proceeding --

If it is in advance of a proceeding -- and

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes.

-- is likely, then the answer

12

depends on whether you know that you are concealing --

13

that you know a crime has been committed.

14

that a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a

15

federal statute, 18 U.S.C. --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if you know

My question is, Does that give

17

-- would that give some content to the meaning of

18

"corruptly," in your view?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, in that case, if the witness

20

knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking

21

them to violate, they have a duty, under those

22

circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your

23

offense.

24

So if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are

25

corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would

That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law.

1

fall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur

2

Andersen is advancing here.

3

And it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress

4

really did for a hundred years before 2002.

What it did

5

is, it said that -- under the Pettibone rule, that it is

6

not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of

7

a proceeding.

8

crime has been -- a crime has been committed and you

9

destroy documents, that is a crime.

But if you know that -- if you know that a

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MS. MAHONEY:

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I --

That's a crime --- may I ask you about

13

another provision, Section 1515(c)?

14

chapter -- and it -- and it's referring back to Section

15

1512 -- "does not prohibit or punish the providing of

16

lawful bona fide legal representation services in

17

connection with, or anticipation of, an official

18

proceeding."

19
20
21

And that says, this

Now, how -- did Ms. Temple invoke that provision
in this case?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the -- that section

22

was not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked

23

in the following way, in two ways.

24

was evidence introduced in the case that she was providing

25

legal advice.

First of all, there

And since it is not in affirmative defense,
6

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it really was the Government's burden at all times, at

2

least once there was evidence introduced that she was

3

providing legal advice, to get a finding from the jury

4

that she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services,

5

particularly in this case, Your Honor, where the

6

Government argued, told the jury, that Nancy Temple was

7

the, quote, "central figure," end quote, in this -- in

8

this episode.

9
10

And in addition --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you know it's not an

affirmative defense?

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, it doesn't read like an

12

affirmative defense, Your Honor.

13

"affirmative defense."

14

introduced, it was listed in the legislation as a Rule of

15

Construction.

16

It doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on Andersen,

17

or on Nancy Temple.

It doesn't say

It simply -- and in -- when it was

And I think that's exactly how it reads.

18

And, Your honor, I think, actually --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, of course, it has the

20

word "lawful," "the providing of lawful bona fide legal

21

representation services."

22

argued that if she violating the other provisions, she's

23

still in violation.

24
25

MS. MAHONEY:

So, you know, it could be

Well, Your Honor, under the

Government's definition of "corruptly," she couldn't have
7

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

been providing lawful bona fide services.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, that's what I want to

3

know, is, in light of the Government's position and the

4

way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what

5

does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision?

6

just curious how it all plays out.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

I'm

Your Honor, I think it negates it

8

in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in

9

this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding

10

ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the

11

Andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that

12

their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt.

13

were instructed that they must find that.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

They

Well, does that have the

15

effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your

16

view?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely.

But I think, Your

18

Honor -- because I think it would be impossible to satisfy

19

it under this instruction.

20

the -- that this provision really just demonstrates that

21

the Government's interpretation of "corruptly" is wrong,

22

to begin with.

23

In addition, I also think that

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What's the effect, in

24

1512(b), of the word "knowingly"?

25

MS. MAHONEY:

I think, Your Honor, that
8

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

"knowingly" means, in this context -- just as it means

2

"knowingly intimidate," "knowingly threatened," "knowingly

3

corruptly persuade" -- that means that you have to know

4

that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate

5

their duties, to violate the law.

6

it's corrupt.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You have to know that

Isn't that satisfied at least

8

by the part of the definition that refers to "subverting

9

an official proceeding"?

I mean, that certainly carries,

10

to me, the implication that you realize that you're doing

11

something wrong.

12

at least, lawful, and you are subverting it.

13

satisfy the "knowingly" requirement?

14

An official proceeding is, prima facie

MS. MAHONEY:

Doesn't that

I don't think so, Your Honor,

15

because the definition that was given to this jury was

16

"subvert, undermine, or impede," and not just the

17

integrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding

18

ability of a future proceeding --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MS. MAHONEY:

21
22

I --

-- including a governmental

inquiry.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- I think I would go far in

23

agreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been

24

"merely to impede" or "merely to undermine."

25

that gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and

Now, I guess

9

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you can probably do it.

2

giving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the

3

term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities,

4

separately, or did it do it simply as "subvert, undermine,

5

or" -- what was the third? -- impede"?

6

MS. MAHONEY:

Did the -- did the Court, in

Impede.

I believe -- I believe it

7

was done as a -- as a -- as a group.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MS. MAHONEY:

10

Okay.

It did --

But it says "or."

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- one other question.

In

11

anticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel

12

new what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to

13

the jury that "merely impeding," alone, or "merely

14

undermining," alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from

15

saying, "If he subverts, undermines, and impedes"?

16

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I'm not certain of the

17

answer, except that I do know that the Government did

18

argue that simply -- the mere idea that David Duncan

19

testified that, you know, he thought that the -- somebody

20

at the SEC might want to look at this information someday

21

was sufficient to satisfy the instructions.

22

think it is a fair inference that the way that they argued

23

this case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind

24

of information away from the SEC was enough to satisfy the

25

definition in this case.

And so, I

And, in fact, Your Honor, when
10

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the instructions were being debated, the pattern

2

instruction for the Fifth Circuit for "corruptly," under

3

1503, actually is -- includes the words "knowingly or

4

dishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding."

5

The Government insisted that the word "dishonestly" not be

6

used, that the word "impede" be added, and they changed

7

"fact-finding" a bit -- changed it from "subverting the

8

proceedings" to "the fact-finding ability."

9

everything they could to strip this instruction of any

They did

10

mens rea, and then went beyond that and said, "And in

11

addition, even if the Andersen employees had a good-faith

12

and sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the

13

law, it's still a crime."

14

So, what we have here is an array of testimony

15

from people who say, "We honestly believed that this was

16

permissible conduct," but the jury was told that they had

17

to convict anyway if there was any possible partial

18

motivation to impede possible future fact-finding --

offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him

and his lawyer; in other -- and the Government -- which is

5

basically the instruction that was given in this case.

6

When he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said,

despite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the

8

time, that he had done anything unlawful or improper.

9

said, "I thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate.

15

What sentence did he get, by

MS. MAHONEY:

He's not been sentenced yet, Your

Honor.

16

And he was explicit throughout.

He also said --

17

he never testified that he even thought that an SEC

18

proceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it

19

was possible.

20

tried to hide the truth or hide the facts.

21

say is that, "Yes, part of what was on my mind at the time

22

that I asked for compliance with this policy was that the

23

SEC and others might want to look at these files someday,

24

and I'd better get them in compliance with our retention

policy, because I know that drafts and notes are the kinds

of things that could be misused and misconstrued at some

2

point in the future."

3

plea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case.

4

And the Government's interpretation, the instructions that

5

were given to this jury, deprived the term "corruptly

6

persuade" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning.

7

That was the basis of his guilty

Under the Government's view, for instance, of

8

"corruptly," bribery becomes irrelevant under this

9

statute.

I mean, if you look at this statute, and you

10

say, "What was Congress trying to prohibit here when it

11

says" -- it's a got a list of wrongful means of

12

interfering with witnesses.

13

"threaten" and "use of physical force," and it says

14

"corruptly persuades."

15

your mind is bribery.

16

Government's interpretation, and let me explain why.

17

Because they say that, "Well, yes, it's true, it says

18

'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you -- is if

19

you had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a

20

proceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking.

21

doesn't matter whether you used any money -- monetary

22

compensation in order to extract this behavior; you're

23

automatically guilty.

25

1

MS. MAHONEY:

It absolutely would, Your Honor,

2

because it would basically cover any kind of request.

3

But, in addition, they say that under their

4

definition what it really means is that if you did it for

5

some other motive, if you got them to destroy the document

6

so that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding --

7

and that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an

8

official proceeding -- and you bribed them to do it, but

9

your motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a

10

crime.

11

a crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded

12

them to destroy a document for use in an official

13

proceeding, even if -- at the appropriate time, if there

14

is a nexus -- because it doesn't matter whether you were

15

trying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to

16

keep it out of the -- of the proceeding, of course that

17

would be covered by the traditional definition of

18

"corruptly persuade."

19

Under Andersen's interpretation, it would still be

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you're anticipating a

20

revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from

21

the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not

22

required to keep, but that would make the officials' task

23

easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of

24

days, instead of -- it's going to take him a week.

25

you make it harder for him?

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, under Section 1519,

2

now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior,

3

because it -- Congress has now, basically, required you to

4

preserve documents.

But, at the time, no, that would not

5

have been a crime.

And if you could do it yourself, then

6

asking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what

7

Congress really had in mind under Section 1512.

8

hypothetical, the man could throw it out himself and not

9

go to jail, but if he asked his wife to do it, then he

10
11

You know,

goes to jail for ten years.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is, in the case, this

12

lingering feeling that something's wrong out there.

13

know that we don't -- we don't convict people on that

14

basis; we require something more specific.

15

MS. MAHONEY:

I

Well, and I think that this

16

statute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly

17

what that specific thing is.

18

you mislead them, if you use physical force, if you

corruptly persuade them.

20

used unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to

21

violate their independent legal duties.

22

definition, Your Honor, is quite consistent with the

traditional interpretation of the term "corruptly," even

24

in the obstruction statutes.

congressional adoption of the term "corruptly persuades,"

3

the Jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed

4

that "corruptly" means "knowingly and willfully, with the

5

specific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties

6

as a petit juror."

7

Similarly, in Aguilar, in the District Court, the

8

jury was instructed -- that was a tampering case -- quote,

9

"an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily and

10

intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or

11

a lawful result by some unlawful method," end quote.

This is exactly parallel to the interpretation that

very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519.

19

that 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could,

20

indeed, say, "You can't have record-retention programs."

21

How else do you interpret 1519?

Well --- -- in 2002.

If

they're gonna -- if they're going to say it, though, they

10

have to say it with very clear language, because,

11

otherwise, there would be no fair warning.

12

conclude from the language of the witness-tampering

13

statute, which is designed to protect witnesses, that

14

Congress had made all record-retention programs unlawful.

You couldn't

15

I also think, Your Honor, that when it comes

16

time to construe Section 1519, some kind of nexus will

17

have to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because,

18

otherwise, you are correct, all document retention

19

policies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

21

"document"?

22

just some handwritten notes?

23

And what is a

I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is it

MS. MAHONEY:

Do they become "documents"?

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And, in

24

this case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know,

25

Andersen retained its work papers, and the work papers
18

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

were extremely extensive, and they were required to fully

2

document the audit.

3

were notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been

4

incorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the

5

work papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this

6

case, is that there were some documents that were

7

destroyed.

8

that document-retention policies are designed to

9

eliminate, in part -- for a variety of reasons, but, in

The only things that were thrown away

They were precisely the kinds of documents

11

can be misconstrued.

12

For instance, Your Honor, the FBI agents,

13

generally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their

21

And there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would

22

have put Andersen on notice that its document-retention

23

policy was -- well, in fact, the Government doesn't say

24

its document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a

25

crime.

Instead, the crime was when David Duncan asked his

give fair warning that that --

Was Section 1519 at issue?

No, Your Honor.

Section 1519 did

not get passed until the year 2002.

It did not exist.

7

Instead, the rule that was in force then was the Pettibone

8

rule, the one that's reflected in the text of Section

9

1505; and that is, "the proceeding must be pending."

10

That's, no doubt, why the Government didn't charge

11

Andersen with a crime under Section 1505.

make it sound like the culpability here is the destruction

13

of records.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that is -- that is still

But I -- just to make it

clear, I take it you would still have the same objection

5

to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a

6

proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, if a proceeding is -- yes,

8

we would, in this case.

Yes, absolutely.

But, you know,

9

if a proceeding is pending, then it changed the -- changes

10

the way that you apply the definition of "corruptly."

11

you're certainly right that the definition is the same.

12

The question is, under the proper definition of

13

"corruptly," did you induce the witnesses to engage in

14

this activity through improper means, such as bribery, or

15

did you try to get them to violate their independent legal

16

duties?

17

1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because

18

what you have done is, you have asked the witness to

19

engage in conduct which violates the law, and that

20

corrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of

21

the statute, it fits with the structure.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Arthur Andersen's conduct in this case explains

8

why Congress enacted a statute like Section 1512 that

9

protects against the anticipatory destruction of documents

10

when a proceeding is --

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, Section 1519, enacted

12

subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than

1512?

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 was

15

enacted after the events --

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Right.

-- in this case in order to plug

18

the loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existed

19

in Section 1512 at the time.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you think it's superfluous.

21

1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in

22

futility, because the law already did what 1519 said.

what 1519 says.

O'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's

8

similarly incorporated in 1505.

9

against obstruction of pending judicial, administrative,

Those statutes protected

10

and congressional proceedings.

11

1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending

12

proceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't

13

get robbed before the proceeding starts.

14

The innovation in Section

If Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a

15

grand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next

16

day, a corporation can send out a directive to its

17

employees and say, "Shred all the smoking guns."

basis that if he asked somebody else to do what was

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, Justice O'Connor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor

12

provision for legal advice and so on?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it is, in this case, if her

intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your definition of

7

"subvert, undermine" is, if you destroy any document that

might raise a question, say, in the IRS audit.

to me that is a sweeping position, which will cause

10

problems for every major corporation or small business in

this country.

12

I just -- I just don't understand it.

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,

13

because the Government's position here has never been that

14

the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used

15

under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute.

16

What the Government focused on in this case was using a

17

document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to

clean up and purge files when a government investigation

was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials

The training

that, a general training session for all employees,

saying, "This is our document," quote, "retention policy."

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but that was triggered, in

14

part, by Nancy Temple's recognition -- in the midst of

15

serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron

was in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which

17

was basically on probation with the SEC -- because it had

18

been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior

19

summer, and was under a cease and desist order -- and

20

seeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she

21

decides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at

22

all compliant with this document-retention policy, "It's

23

time to get the files in line."

of a sudden the company had become preoccupied with

"corruptly" could include a person who knows three things:

one, that the investigation, which has not yet started,

almost certainly will want this document; two, there is no

legal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him

to do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's

important to the investigation.

Now, that's what

15

the facts of the case are subsumed within the description

17

findings on all of those features; and that is, in large

18

part, because of the kinds of instructions that Arthur

19

Andersen --

20

The jury instructions did not require

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

The jury instruction left

21

out the word "corruptly," as far as I can see, in the part

22

that was critical.

They define "corruptly" as simply an

23

intent to impede.

And the word "impede" goes well beyond

24

what I've said, both because it does not cover the three

25

things, but, most particularly, because it does not say

that it was dishonest or that the person who did the

persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the

investigation would have the legal right to get the

material and there was no right to withhold it.

that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say

precisely that, were at least a step in the right

direction.

MR. DREEBEN:

The words

The jury instruction said less

than what you have suggested, Justice Breyer, no question

10

about it, but what they did require was that there be an

11

intent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation.

12

I think --

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wasn't -- wasn't that

14

instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be

15

the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of

16

what was being done was no defense?

17

instruction that depended upon the word "subvert," I could

18

-- I could understand your argument.

19

that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty

20

with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond

21

"subvert" to merely "impede," and it included an

22

instruction that good faith was no defense.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, if you had an

"Knowingly corruptly."

The word "knowingly" does not

travel down the statute to modify "corruptly."

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

mean, there's no grammatical break.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

It --

I don't see why it doesn't.

I

Well, there is a logical break,

16

because if it travel down the statute and reach all the

17

way to "misleading conduct," what Congress would have

18

written is a statute, when you read the definition of

19

"misleading conduct," that says, "whoever knowingly

20

knowingly makes a false statement," because the definition

21

of misleading conduct includes "knowingly making false

22

statements," "knowingly omitting things," "intentionally

23

engaging in deceptive behavior."

24

-- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever.

25

And you'd end up with a

It makes sense for Congress to have said,

But then when you

get to the word "threat," there is inherent knowledge in

it.

definition of "misleading conduct" inherently --

"Corruptly" inherently embodies knowledge.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the

Well, it's certainly --

-- embodies knowledge.
I mean, I will -- I will grant

8

you that the definition that the Government asked for, and

9

got, for "corruptly persuades," does have that

10

implication, so far as the "subvert" prong is concerned.

11

But when you get beyond the "subvert" prong, and you get

12

down to the third one, "merely to impede," you're getting

13

pretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of

14

knowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go

15

the problem of the instruction that negated good faith is

16

a defense.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Let me try to address each of

18

those.

First of all, the words were used as a definition

19

of "improper purpose," and they were used together,

20

"subvert, undermine, or impede," and they logically have a

21

relationship to each other.

22

looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it

23

talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining

24

of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that

25

the Government was anticipated to make.

"impede" has to be read logically in that group.

2

will acknowledge that "impeding" can have broader

3

connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the

4

obstruction --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, I

Why did -- if that is so, why

6

did you need it?

In other words, you had a -- you had a

7

pattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was

8

keyed to "subversion," which I think would be an easy

9

argument for you.

If the addition of "impede" really

10

wasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put

11

it in there?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Here is what it adds, Justice

Souter.

1503, Section 1505 --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That's correct.

That's correct.

But what --

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not there.

-- what the Government was doing

8

in this instance was attempting to give content to the

9

word "corruptly" that would enable the jurors to know that

10

they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in

11

dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext

12

to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-

13

finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but it sounds like --

15

actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute,

16

but that's, in a sense, my problem.

about "corruptly persuading another person to destroy a

paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability

for use in an official proceeding."

21

the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede."

Fine.

23

but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the

24

word "corruptly."

The statute talks

of "corruptly" that --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So to define

3

"corruptly" as "doing the same thing that the rest of the

I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of

purpose.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

If I were a juror,

The Court of Appeals addressed the

8

argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of

"corruptly" that was used in this case is redundant and

10
11

superfluous in light of the additional intent that -JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not perfectly redundant.

12

One can imagine driving a wedge between making something

13

14

investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-

15

finding ability of the investigator.

16

logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar

17

that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a

18

difference between those two phrases.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

They're not

Well, I think that they have a

20

very significant difference, an important function in

ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope

22

of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is

what Congress intended it to do.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge

inquiry concerning the word "knowingly," you said the word

3

"knowingly" appears later, so that it would be -- it would

be reduplicative.

about, in 1512(b)?

7

In responding to Justice Souter's

What later appearance are you talking

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) --

or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. DREEBEN:

-- of the Government's appendix --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. DREEBEN:

the page, subsection (b) --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The last phrase in the sequence is

20

"engages in misleading conduct towards another person."

21

That phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page

22

11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's

23

appendix.

24

"misleading conduct" means "knowingly making a false

25

statement; intentionally omitting information from a

It's Section 1515(a)(3).

And it says the term

inviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to

5

device."

6

So, "knowingly" is to be read in as if it were

7

part of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term

8

"engaging in misleading conduct," so you would end up with

9

a statute that Congress have, for some reason, drafted

10

that includes the word "knowingly" at the beginning, and

11

then "knowingly" later as the definition of one of the

12

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

is, and always has been, a scienter term, and its

2

appearance in Section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant

3

from the fact that that word appears in Section 1503.

4

When Congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to

5

believe, because it intended to do this, that the

6

definition of "corruptly," that had been fairly widespread

7

in the use of the word in Section 1503, would be applied

8

to 1512.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why --

And, in that context --- why isn't the answer to your

12

argument that the requirement in (b) -- "knowingly"

13

requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through

14

the series, but it travels at least as far as "corruptly

15

persuades"?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that's sort of reading the

17

statute just to achieve a result.

it would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at

the end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle.

MR. DREEBEN:

confusing, Justice O'Connor.

This is a statute that was

8

enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-

9

understood meaning of the word "corruptly."

The same word

10

appears in Section 1505.

When the D.C. Circuit concluded

11

that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular

12

case, Congress came back with a definition that

13

legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said

14

"corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose."

15

"improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has

16

traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice."

The

17

That definition logically applies to Section

18

1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades

19

provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it

20

had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-

21

tampering in the statute, originally.

22

concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section

23

1503, either.

And some courts

24

To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model

25

of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety

of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test

would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering

a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the

4

witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying

documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an

anticipation that the subpoena was likely.

had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had

time of the enactment of this statute.

16

specifically said, "We want 1512 to be able to pick up the

kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer

Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to

attacking the word "corruptly," also has advanced a number

of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some

connection that had to be required between the Defendant's

7

that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5

MS. MAHONEY:

Thank you.

6

I'd like to first address the fact that much of

7

the Government's argument is focused on this nexus, the

8

imminence of the proceeding, that sort of thing, but

9

actually the jury was not required to find any nexus

10

whatsoever, and was told the wrong definition of an

11

"official proceeding," to boot.

12

informal inquiry by the SEC staff was an official

13

proceeding, and that an official proceeding was already

14

going on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact,

15

even before Nancy Temple even knew about that informal

16

inquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error.

17

And --

And

issue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's

13

expectation of a proceeding that should be required under

14

this statute? -- and found that "feared" was enough.

15

That's not enough.

16

if a broad definition, like the one the Government wants

17

to have -- there's got to be a serious nexus.

18

"Possible" is not enough, especially

Nexus problems can be avoided, though, if the

19

more traditional definition of "corruptly" is used in the

20

first place, which is not only required by lenity, but,

21

frankly, is required even by the witness-tampering cases

22

under Section 1503.

23

"corruptly" are completely consistent with Andersen's

definition.

As I read to you, the definitions of
