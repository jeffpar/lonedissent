ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-70

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:

11

This Court 32 years ago in Zahn v. International

12

Paper affirmed that a class action could not proceed under

13

28 U.S.C., section 1332, the diversity statute, if it was

14

clear that some of the unnamed members of that class do

15

not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.

16

The question in this case is whether Congress in

17

1990 overturned this Court's ruling in Zahn and its

18

interpretation of section 1332 not by amending section

19

1332 but, instead, by enacting a supplemental jurisdiction

20

statute, section 1367.

21

Honors, is no.

22

The answer to that question, Your

Plaintiffs in the lower courts that have felt

23

constrained to conclude that the language of section 1367

24

requires the conclusion that Zahn and, candidly, also this

25

Court's decision in Strawbridge were overruled by 1367 do

Page 4

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

so by gliding past the express language in 1367(a) that is

2

the primary basis upon which our argument stands.

3

In the appendix 246a to the petition, there's -­

4

the central language is in (a).

5

action, of which the district courts have original

6

jurisdiction.

7

indicates that Congress did not mean to make any

8

adjustments in the background law that exists that defined

9

diversity jurisdiction or Federal court jurisdiction,

10

Federal question jurisdiction as a condition to going

11

forward.

12

it exists in 1990, as it's been interpreted by this Court,

13

and then determine whether or not there's Federal

14

jurisdiction, either for diversity or Federal question,

15

and if there is, then you proceed forth from that point.

16

It says, in any civil

That language by its terms and -- clearly

So what the Congress says is, look at the law as

And what we know is that there are two

17

situations that will not satisfy original jurisdiction

18

under those circumstances.

19

The first one is in the Zahn situation.

Where

20

you have both satisfying and unsatisfying plaintiffs in

21

the unnamed -- who are in the unnamed members of the

22

class, this Court said you cannot proceed forth under the

23

diversity jurisdiction.

24
25

The second one is the classic sort of joinder
situation, and what the Court held in Strawbridge is that

Page 5

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

simply because you have a plaintiff who satisfies the

2

amount-in-controversy requirement and satisfies the

3

complete diversity requirement does not mean that you're

4

allowed to join under rule 20 an additional plaintiff who

5

does not satisfy both of those requirements.

6

bring someone in under those circumstances, that defeats

7

jurisdiction at the beginning before you ever took to

8

trying to decide what the scope of section 1367(a) and (b)

9

mean from that point forward.

10

And if you

So then the question is, if that's the correct

11

interpretation of 1367(a)'s predicate language, then what

12

work does 1367(a) and 1367(b) do, and does our

13

interpretation do any violence to the structure of the

14

statute?

15

And the answer to that is clearly no.
Here we start by looking at what was Congress'

16

clear intent, manifested primarily in the last language of

17

1367(a), where it says supplemental jurisdiction shall

18

include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of

19

additional parties.

20

Here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, before you

21

proceed to going on to (b), the -- you have set up a

22

dichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long

23

as you have a Federal question claim in the case, you

24

qualify within those words, of which the district courts

25

have original jurisdiction.

But you say that in a

Page 6

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

diversity case, that's not so if you have people not of

2

the same citizenship -- of the same citizenship on both

3

sides of the party line, so that you have to have a

4

totally qualifying action on the diversity side to come

5

within -- to -- to be within 1367(a).

6

But we have had at least two cases where the

7

starting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity

8

rule.

9

and the Court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't

One was Caterpillar and the other was Newman-Green,

10

complete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the

11

one case before the case was tried, in the other in the

12

court of appeals.

13

suggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in

14

the Federal court even though at the outset you don't have

15

-- fill all the requirements?

16

So don't at least those two cases

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I don't think that's the

17

right conclusion to draw from those cases, Justice

18

Ginsburg, because what happened is by the time that -­

19

those cases got to this Court, the jurisdictional problems

20

had been solved and the Court was faced with a question -­

21

with what I perceive to be purely a remedial question, is

22

what do you do in terms of trying to put the omelette back

23

into the egg at that point when the litigation has gone

24

forward.

25

efficiency, decided essentially to ignore the

And the Court, as a matter of judicial

jurisdictional problem.

3

Here, by contrast, this jurisdictional problem
existed on day one, and the complaint was filed -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the Court said

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought the Court didn't
I thought they said it was

Well, it -- it's curable in the

11

sense that you can eventually excise out portions of the

12

case, but what you cannot do is -- is allow the case to go

13

-- it remains still jurisdictionally barred to proceed

14

forth with parties who are not properly before the court.

15

That's -- that's what this Court said specifically in -­

16

in Zahn itself.

17

simply go forward with the Federal claim and with the

18

State claims in that -- in that format.

19

excise portions of them, but then you start over again.

Once you excise them, that's a new complaint.

over and Newman-Green wasn't detected till appeal, but the

2

appeals court didn't say start over.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I understand that the Court's

4

ultimate remedy in both of those cases was not to do a do­

5

over, but you also have to remember -- I mean, I think

6

there are two questions here.

7

jurisdictional problem.

8

this Court has never ignored the jurisdictional problem.

9

It always solves the jurisdictional problem somehow,

One is do you ignore the

And what I'm proposing to you is

10

whether it dismisses the case, as it did in -- in Grupo

11

Dataflux, whether it dismisses the case, as it -- as it

12

proposed would have to happen in Zahn if they didn't

13

excise one of the parties, or whether it makes an

14

adjustment.

15

jurisdictional problem and finds a method of fixing it.

16

So that's the -­

17
18

The Court always takes account of the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

adjustment in this case, Mr. Phillips.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

But why can't it make an

I'm sorry, Justice Stevens.
Why can't it make an

adjustment in this case?
MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- well, the -- and the

23

question is what adjustment should it make.

And the -­

24

and -- and our argument is at a minimum you have to

25

dismiss all of the class claims.

Page 9

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But why is that the minimum?

2

Wouldn't the minimum be just to dismiss those parties who

3

don't have the aggregate -- the necessary jurisdictional

4

amount?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

And that takes you back to what

6

the district court ruled in Zahn and -- and, in effect,

7

what this Court affirmed in Zahn, which is that there's a

8

fundamental difference between sort of finding a single,

9

individual plaintiff and saying, you know, this person, if

10

you could just excise that claim, drop it under rule -­

11

that person under rule 21, that fixes it.

12

fundamental difference.

13

There's a

I mean, the question here is what's the civil

14

action because there are res judicata, collateral

15

estoppel -­

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but you do have cases

17

where a complaint is filed seeking to be a class action

18

and then the district judge does not certify the class and

19

the case, nevertheless, goes forward.

20

you do that here?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, why couldn't

Well, that would -- one of the

22

alternatives on the table -- I think it is appropriate -­

23

is for the Court to excise the class action allegations -­

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

-- and dismiss the entirety of

Page 10

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the class and proceed forth solely in the name of the four

2

individual plaintiffs.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, maybe.

Why isn't it

4

permissible just to dismiss those parties who don't have

5

the requisite jurisdictional amount?

6

where I stumble with this.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's what I -­

I think the Court has the

8

authority to do that.

9

of that are overwhelming and should be -- and should be

10

rejected for that reason because in order to be able to

11

have res judicata/collateral estoppel effects, you have to

12

know what the civil action is.

13

unnamed members, who are, in many instances, unknowable in

14

-- in some respects, we don't know what the res judicata

15

or collateral estoppel effects are if your solution is to

16

try to excise those who do not satisfy the amount-in-

17

controversy requirement.

18

I think the practical implications

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And with a class of

I don't -- I don't follow

19

that entirely, Mr. Phillips, because the -- Exxon lost at

20

-- at this trial, and preclusion doctrines -- that means

21

that Exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend.

22

So Exxon is going to be bound by that -- by the

23

determination.

might say, well, I want more, say, somebody who had opted

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, you'd have the

2

same issue of preclusion problems if you had done the case

3

from the beginning the way you contend it ought to have

4

been done.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the case

6

should never have been allowed to go forward except with

7

the named plaintiffs.

8

Okay.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I mean, Justice Ginsburg's

9

point is you -- you -- even with a -- a few properly named

10

defendants, you're going to have the same issue preclusion

11

problem.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, not -- but -- but it's a

13

much more complicated issue preclusion problem because the

14

question is, is there jurisdiction?

15

that's been entered without jurisdiction.

16

doesn't have proper jurisdiction here --

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

This is a judgment
The court

Well, if it's under the

18

language of section 1367, I think it makes more sense to

19

say the court has original jurisdiction over the action,

20

but lacks original jurisdiction over the defective claims.

21

I mean, that meets what 1367 seems to say on its face.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I would -­

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And I hope you will address

24

the fact that Congress very recently has enacted

25

legislation that makes all this in the future at least

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it doesn't eliminate it

3

completely, Justice O'Connor.

Act only applies to claims where there are plaintiffs who

5

exceed the number of 100, plaintiffs over 100, and -- and

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it's not retroactive.

But

10

even prospectively, there will be situations where this

11

precise issue will arise in the future.

12

reason for the Court to go ahead and resolve this question

13

that has so badly divided the courts.

14

So there is

But, Justice O'Connor, to answer your first

15

question, I would have -- I would have thought the

16

conclusion was exactly the opposite, that what -- what -­

17

the statute says you don't have jurisdiction over civil

18

actions over which you didn't have jurisdiction prior to

19

1990, but you do have jurisdiction over claims that then

20

can be appended to those for which you have jurisdiction

21

in 1990.

22

So I would have thought the more sensible way,

23

at least from my perspective, to read this case -- to read

24

this statute is to say, is this a claim that could have

25

been brought in 1990?

And the answer from Zahn is

Page 13

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. PHILLIPS:

And similarly with the -­

And -It was enacted later.

It clearly was enacted later, but

my point here is that I think the language -- when the

10

Congress both in (a) and (b) harkens back to in any civil

11

action of which the district courts have original

12

jurisdiction, it's clearly not trying to amend 1331 or

13

1332.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's not -- the weakness

15

in your point, I think, as I -- as I understand it, which

16

is a very optimistic assumption, given the complexity

17

here -­

18
19
20

MR. PHILLIPS:

I hope that's not a criticism of

the writing.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is -- is that you want to

21

read (a) as if it applies to arising-under jurisdiction

22

and not to diversity jurisdiction.

23

under jurisdiction, you do maintain jurisdiction over the

24

original action.

25

there's one good claim arising under, there's original

Very simple.

You can add a claim, but as long as

Diversity, there isn't.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, that's not right, Justice

Breyer.

All right.

The -- the -- you know, the

You're from one State, I'm from another

10

State, I have a claim against you for at least $50,000, I

11

sue you in diversity jurisdiction.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

That is a civil action of which

district courts have original jurisdiction.

15
16

Yes.

So I've sued you.

You have an insurer who's

going -- who -- who lives in the same State I live.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

You bring in the insurer in a

19

third party -- in a third party claim under rule 14.

20

Okay?

21

the amount-in-controversy requirement is that applies,

22

because you've got a -- a retention.

23

so your -- your claim against them is only for $50,000.

24

That wouldn't satisfy the amount-in-controversy

25

requirement but it does satisfy the supplemental

That claim doesn't satisfy the $75,000, whatever

Okay?

Then -- and

1
2

jurisdiction over claims brought separately.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so, in -- in other words,

3

in that situation, it's a third party claim by the

4

defendant against another person.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

Yes.

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely falls within (a).

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15
16
17

And then (b) knocks it out

insofar as the plaintiff wants to assert a claim.

11

13

So that's then -- that does

fall within (a).

8

10

That would be one easy -­

Exactly.
But that person can assert a

claim against a plaintiff.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Exactly.

That would be precisely

how it operates.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So that, you say, is the answer

to what I was going to ask -­

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Which is?

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which is why didn't they

20

just use the word 1331.

And the reason they didn't just

21

use the word 1331 is there is a subset of diversity claims

22

that also have to fall within (a).

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I picked one.

All right.

There's another one that fits -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the other thing, of course,

2

is if these three professors who wrote this had -- had

3

figured this out so well, why in heaven's name didn't they

4

at least write an article about it so we'd know what we

5

were doing?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my guess is if they did,

8

you probably wouldn't want to rely on it as the

9

authoritative source for interpreting the language of the

10

statute in any event.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What you're saying, Mr.

12

Phillips, I think is that 1367 does nothing with regard to

13

what was in the old days at least 1367(a), what was called

14

ancillary jurisdiction.

15

to overrule the Finley case.

It changed pendent jurisdiction

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Pendent party jurisdiction.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- so you could have

18

appendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary

19

jurisdiction, applicable in diversity case, was not

20

changed at all by 1367(a).

21

saying.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that's what you're

Well, no.

Actually what I'm

23

saying is that 1367(a), in effect, codifies both aspects

24

of the Kroger -- of this Court's decision in Kroger.

25

Kroger, the Court said you would have ancillary

for Justice Breyer, and that that would fall within

would not allow the plaintiff then to bring a subsequent

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But whether you -- whether

7

you call it codify or anything else, there would be no

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Kroger was unchanged.

I

It doesn't make any change.

The only way I would just -- you

16

know, the only point I would make with respect to that is

17

that I do think that in Finley this Court's opinion cast

18

some doubt on the entire pendent and ancillary

19

jurisdiction doctrines, and I think that 1367(a) is

20

clearly designed to -- to eliminate that issue going

21

forward because it says there is a role.

22

-- an express provision from Congress to the courts of

23

supplemental jurisdiction.

24

what circumstances does it apply.

25

There is now a

assumed that there was ancillary jurisdiction over the

third party claim.

that there is jurisdiction over the third party claim

because it -- it extends to that claim.

by the express language of the provision.

6

This statute makes it absolutely clear

And we know that

It wouldn't have changed anything if you accept

7

the idea that the Court had inherent authority to do that.

If you question that, then this is the basis on which that

jurisdictional grant is provided.

important part of 1367(a) that affects -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what -- what is the

12

language in 1367(a) that effects any -- any change in

I don't see that there's any change.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I would go back -­
You may -- you may say that

there's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it just depends on whether

19

you accept as a given that the third party claim and other

20

multi-party litigation was clearly going to fall within

21

the Court's ancillary jurisdiction without the benefit of

22

an express statutory provision granting that authority.

23

If you accept that, then this makes a fundamental change.

24

If I could -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that's what Kroger

plaintiff then couldn't turn around and sue the third

party defendant.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that you did not need

diversity between the defendant and the third party

defendant.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but the -- the question is

what was the statutory authority for that part of -- for

10

the first part of ancillary jurisdiction, which is the

11

bringing in of the third party defendant.

12

1367(a) does in the diversity context.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN 04-79

20

MR. LONG:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

21

Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:

22

I have three basic points.

23

First, section 1367 does not alter the

24

requirements of section 1332 for original jurisdiction in

25

a civil diversity action, and therefore, the plain

Page 20

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

language of section 1367 does not alter the complete

2

diversity requirement or the requirement that each

3

plaintiff in a diversity action must have more than

4

$75,000 in controversy.

5

Second, there is no sound basis for

6

distinguishing between the two jurisdictional requirements

7

of section 1332, and therefore, if section 1367 alters the

8

matter-in-controversy rule of Zahn and Clark, it also

9

alters the complete diversity rule of Strawbridge.

10

And third, the best interpretation of section

11

1367 and the one that causes the least harm is that it

12

overturns the result in Finley and otherwise, with a few

13

exceptions, codifies the pre-Finley understanding of

14

supplemental jurisdiction.

15

Now, our -- our primary argument has already

16

been addressed, and I don't want to waste time on it but

17

it is crucial, critical to our argument.

18

that the language of 1367(a) is that supplemental

19

jurisdiction is conferred but only in a civil action, of

20

which the district courts have original jurisdiction.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that is,

And then you say the civil

action has to give -- be diverse as to all claims.

I mean, basically each -­

as to each plaintiff, they must be diverse from each

25

Yes.
Now, in -- in City of Chicago,

5

we did not give that meaning to the term civil action.

6

Now, then you would say, well, City of Chicago is a

7

Federal question case.

8

MR. LONG:

Exactly.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then I would say then

10

you're asking us to interpret civil action differently in

11

two statutes.

12

MR. LONG:

No, I don't think so.

I think what

13

the plain language -- and -- and here we are, I think -­

14

we can rely on plain language.

15

in each case you must look to some other statute that

16

confers original jurisdiction.

19

What 1367(a) says is that

It can be 1331.

It can be

And of course, although those statutes use the same

interpretation of the two differs if -- if the City of

MR. LONG:

Well, but I think it's the same

2

answer.

Original jurisdiction and civil action are found

3

-- each of those terms is found in 1331 and 1332.

4

do think it comes out of this Court's decisions that if

5

you have a Federal question -- so you're claiming original

6

jurisdiction under 1331 -- then yes, that is sufficient to

7

give original jurisdiction over the action.

8

the Court held in the City of Chicago case.

9

And I

That is what

But it really can't be the same in a diversity

10

case if, for example, there's going to be complete

11

diversity.

12

thought that the plain language of 1367 compels this

13

result that Zahn and -- and also Strawbridge go, they say

14

look, the only way we can read this is if there's original

15

jurisdiction of -- of one claim by one plaintiff against

16

one defendant, then we've got original jurisdiction over

17

the civil action.

meet certain requirements, minimal diversity should be

there ought to be simply minimal diversity.

doubling of the Federal courts' diversity docket, which is

about half the trials.

So -- and I don't think there's been any

suggestion by Congress -- and, of course, complete

diversity and matter-in-controversy are the two rules that

keep that from happening.

will be a sufficient -- a significant additional burden on

the Federal courts, and to my knowledge, there aren't any

additional resources to do that.

well, the plaintiff leaves them out and then they come in

What -- what is happening here in (b) is that it's

possible for parties to come in under rules 14, 19, 20, or

We think the reading of that is that Congress wanted

to allow that.

There are a number of cases that are actually

give a sort of brief summary of these situations in which

you could actually bring in extra parties and claims in a

be satisfying complete diversity or matter-in-controversy,

-- that could be a 19, 20, or

24.
MR. LONG:

Exactly.

Exactly.

That's -- and so there is work to be done in
subsection (b) even in a diversity case.
The only other point I'll make here is that

13

counterclaims and cross claims come in under rule 13 of

14

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and there is

15

actually rule 13(h) which says very specifically that

16

parties may be brought in -- additional parties may be

17

brought in under rules 19 and 20, once you get a

18

counterclaim or a cross claim going.

19

explain why there are these references to rules 19 and 20,

20

as well as 14 and 24, in subsection (b).

21

So that is -- could

I do want to get to the argument that's made by

22

-- or the petitioners in our case, which is really -- as I

23

understand their argument, they accept that there must be

24

original jurisdiction over the entire civil action, and

25

they accept that that means that there must be complete

diversity.

2

is really different.

3

It really doesn't go to whether the court has jurisdiction

4

over the civil action.

5

jurisdiction over a particular claim.

6

But then they say, well, matter-in-controversy
It should be treated differently.

It only goes to whether it has

And we don't think that's tenable.

And -- and

7

here would rely on statutory language, and it's the

8

language of section of 1332, which sets out the two

9

requirements for original jurisdiction of a civil action.

10

Strawbridge is an interpretation of that requirement.

11

have original jurisdiction over the civil action, there

12

must be complete diversity.

13

The decisions like Zahn and Clark are an interpretation of

14

the other requirement to have -- to meet the matter-in-

15

controversy requirement, and to have original jurisdiction

16

over the civil action, each plaintiff must meet that

17

requirement.

18

To

Petitioners agree with that.

So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we descend from the level

19

of parsing the -- the statute to what's going on in these

20

cases, in your cases I take it there was an injury to a

21

child.

22

MR. LONG:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

Yes.
And that qualifies under the

amount-in-controversy.
MR. LONG:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And her mother or sister and,

2

I think, father wanted to come in and -- and bring claims

3

that were entirely derivative of the injured child's

4

claim.

5

MR. LONG:

That's correct.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on your reading of 1367,

7

there's the -- the -- there's no accommodation for that.

8

So you'd either have to have the whole lawsuit in the

9

courts of Puerto Rico or you'd have -- let the child sue

10

in the Federal court and the parents would have to bring a

11

separate suit?

12

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, it's not -- it's -­

13

that is the rule of Zahn and Clark that has been the rule

14

for many decades.

15

dropping some of the plaintiffs.

16

but you cannot have this piggy-backing, bringing in

17

additional claims that are jurisdictionally insufficient.

18

You can't get around Strawbridge and complete diversity

19

that way, and you can't get around the matter-in-

20

controversy that way either.

21

the language of 1332.

22

Yes, the problem can be cured by

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a possibility,

They -- they are parallel in

Well, what a legislature

23

might think, well, now this Finley has -- we've been -­

24

taken care of that.

25

And your case looks very much the

Page 36

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

makes sense to try it all together.

2

that old case should go just the way Finley went.

3

So we think that -­

And the same thing with Zahn because, after all,

4

Zahn doesn't fit very well with Ben Hur.

5

that the Strawbridge rule -- I mean, what really counts is

6

diversity, and -- and Ben Hur says the only named

7

representative citizenship counts and yet the amount-in-

8

controversy, the lesser thing in your view -- every single

9

member of the class has to meet that amount, but only the

10

named representatives have to be of diverse citizenship.

11

MR. LONG:

If you're saying

Well, you've made a number of points.

12

I wouldn't agree that the matter-in-controversy is the

13

lesser requirement.

14

situation, because of Ben Hur, that's the only rule that

15

keeps out additional plaintiffs.

16

I mean, indeed, in the class action

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you -- does it make

17

sense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the

18

citizenship of the members of the class for diversity

19

purposes, for diversity of citizenship?

20

representative counts.

21

named representative count for amount-in-controversy?

22

That would have been a rational thing for Congress if they

23

wanted to fix that.

24

MR. LONG:

25

Only the named

Well, then why shouldn't only the

Well, in -- in the class action

context -- and again, my case is not a class action -- I

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

frankly can't explain how you reconcile Ben Hur and Zahn.

2

I think those -- the cases -- for the same -- if -- if the

3

rationale of Ben Hur is that the class members are not

4

really parties in the full sense and so we don't need to

5

worry about their citizenship, I would think you could

6

make the same type of argument as to matter-in-controversy

7

that as long as the representatives satisfy it, they're

8

the parties in the full or true sense and so that's all

9

that counts.

10

But the Court decided Zahn.

There was really no

11

doubt about that.

12

any -- any difficulties with that decision, and it's now

13

well established.

14

Congress never indicated that it had

And I think -- the final point I'd just make

15

very briefly is that if you were to interpret 1367 to have

16

this broad effect of opening up diversity actions to

17

unlimited joinder of plaintiffs, nondiverse plaintiffs,

18

plaintiffs with -- who don't have the requisite amount in

19

controversy, it -- it really would be absurd, not in the

20

sense that doing that on its own is absurd.

21

contend that.

22

rational for Congress to go to all this trouble that it

23

went to in subsection in (b) to rule out all these sort of

24

indirect situations where the plaintiffs leave out a party

25

in the initial complaint and then wait for the party to

I don't

come in some other way -- I mean, things that frankly are

2

not likely to happen in a lot of cases -- but then say,

3

oh, but the -- the doors are -- are wide open under rule

4

20, bring in as many plaintiffs as you want right at the

5

outset or later on if you'd prefer, don't worry about

6

diversity, don't worry about the amount in controversy.

7

Those two things just -- just don't go together.

8

There are -- there are other things about

9

subsection (b) that don't make good sense under the

10

petitioner's view.

11

of them.

12

(b), it says you shall not have supplemental jurisdiction

13

under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against

14

persons made parties under -- a list of rules -- and then

15

one of them is rule 20.

16

I mean, for example, this is just one

If you just look at the language of subsection

Well, whenever you have more than one defendant

17

in a case just named in the complaint, you use rule 20 get

18

in more than one defendant.

19

if you had this broad view, plaintiffs can bring in as

20

many additional plaintiffs as they like under rule 20.

21

But on the defendant's side, as soon as you've got a

22

second defendant in the case, suddenly all this

23

supplemental jurisdiction goes away.

25

to be asserting these kinds of claims anyway.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS IN 04-70

MR. STEARNS:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
I believe what's at stake here is whether this

11

Court was serious in the Finley decision, and it's

12

interesting that it was a 5 to 4 decision, in which four

13

of you concluded that pendent party jurisdiction was a

14

logical extension of Gibbs and five among you concluded

15

that it was not up for this Court to make that

16

determination, that only Congress could make that

17

determination, and in the 200 years of history of the

18

Federal courts that had preceded Finley, that the track

19

record of this Court and the lower courts in expanding

20

Federal jurisdiction had been a rocky one.

21

weren't going to do it anymore.

22

But you

11

And when we look at the history of Federal

this Court has been largely to allow defendants hauled

into court to ignore rules that we once thought were

sacrosanct, for example, the notion of destruction of

jurisdiction.

brought in in a third party practice, any claim that's

2

brought in an additional party claim is part of the same

civil action.

claims of the absent class members who don't meet the

22

jurisdictional amount should be dismissed.

I

All Zahn says, all Snyder said, which

Now, that's a very interesting

In other words, it doesn't say there's no
It simply says the

Now, interesting, look at the language in 1332.

24

It says the district courts shall have original

25

jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.

Well,

2

when we read that statute and we apply Zahn and Snyder, we

3

say civil action doesn't mean the aggregate of all claims.

4

There we say what it means is we must evaluate each

5

individual claim to determine if each individual claim

6

within the civil action meets the jurisdictional minimum

7

of the diversity statute.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

I imagine that if you filed a

9

claim and the plaintiff was a class and the class

10

contained a number of people who did not meet the

11

jurisdictional minimum and they file a claim against a

12

defendant in a diversity suit, I imagine the first thing

13

the judge would say would be, I've read Zahn and we don't

14

have jurisdiction over this action.

15

MR. STEARNS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

Indeed.

That was prior to the -­

Yes, that was prior to the

statute.
So -- so they say, well, that's what the judge

19

would have said, and moreover, if you had not a class

20

action and you had three plaintiffs and one of them was

21

from a different State than the defendant and the other

22

two were not, the first thing the judge would say is, I'm

23

very sorry.

24

25

There is not complete diversity.

I do not

And so I take it their point is by coincidence

or not, that's what this statute says.

MR. STEARNS:

I'd -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

statute says, that's what it means.

5

MR. STEARNS:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And since that's what the

Well -­
It means that this kind of a

7

situation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was

8

not jurisdiction over that action.

9

So I agree with you that those words are what

10

their claim depends upon, but what is the answer to that

11

contention?

12

MR. STEARNS:

Isn't it interesting, Your Honor,

13

that what drove 1367 was this Court's decision in Finley?

14

And what's interesting about the argument that Exxon makes

15

here is that Finley discussed the words civil action.

16

in fact, what Finley said in civil action is rejected, the

17

very argument Exxon makes here -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

And

Finley happened to be

19

an arising-under case, and in an arising-under case, as

20

long as there is one claim that arises under, there is

21

jurisdiction over the action.

was the 1948 recodification came relatively soon after the

adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which

13

provide that there shall be one form of action to be known

the '48 revision inserted the expression, civil action,

throughout the provisions governing district court

meaning to those words, especially when the revision is

more naturally understood as stylistic.

civil action -- and when you look at 1332, which is what

21

Zahn is based on, if their interpretation of the words,

22

civil action, was correct, then Zahn was wrongly decided

and Snyder was wrongly decided.

Indeed, Your Honor, but if their

argument was correct, that the civil action bundled the

5

claims, as they suggest, then Zahn was wrongly decided.

Then the amount in controversy in Zahn was the totality of

all the claims.

8

concluded that the civil action word means an individual

analysis of every claim within it, to preserve that

In other words, to preserve Zahn, which

conclusion, they have to argue the opposite conclusion

14

The problem with that argument is that the

be aggregated, but that they can't get in the door.

starting from this -- because at some point I'd like you

to get to the -- the virtue of their position in my mind

10

at the moment is, one, it is consistent with the language,

which says civil action, not claim.

with the only instruction I read that any legislator gave

to the people who were writing this, staff, namely, write

14

something that's noncontroversial.

this case and the fact that the majority of circuits of

been no class actions of any materiality filed.

they made the note in 1999 or '97 more class actions were

So Zahn is simply a

what Snyder says is because -- because the Class Action

Do you think they were being

MR. STEARNS:

Justice Stevens, I think whether

it is or not, it demonstrates the mistake of relying upon

something other than what's in the plain language of a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-79

Thank you, Mr. Stearns.

MR. AYER:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

14

We have a little bit different view I think of

the statute than the other counsel arguing this morning.

16

We -- we believe that the statute actually makes quite a

17

lot of sense, and we also believe emphatically that it

18

does not reverse the complete diversity requirement.

19

I think the clearest indication of the

20

incorrectness of Mr. Phillips' and Mr. Long's position is

21

the comparative treatment under their reading of the

22

Federal question case that is in Federal court and the

23

Most importantly, for purposes of this comparison, they

will not destroy the original jurisdiction over a civil

Somehow or other, the argument is advanced that

when you have a diversity case in Federal court where all

cases that are not within the original jurisdiction and

9

the diversity case, which is clearly within the original

jurisdiction, because all parties are diverse, but it is

joined with claims that are below the jurisdictional

amount, so that they are not within the diversity

13

jurisdiction.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I don't understand the

15

distinction that you're making between diversity of

16

citizenship and amount in controversy since 1332 includes

both.

In order to

With regard to amount in controversy, it's

perfectly clear, and -- and 1367 changes nothing about the

9

fact that 1332 jurisdiction requires meeting the amount in

supplemental, additional jurisdiction, then the question

12

that has to be asked is, does the fact that a party coming

in with what is otherwise a supplemental claim -- does -­

14

does the presence of that party destroy the original

15

jurisdiction that exists where the new party coming in is

16

diverse but doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount?

you must also be prepared to say that bringing in a new

that those claims are all put on the same piece of a

You could say the same thing.

MR. AYER:

Well, it does, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

there.

MR. AYER:

Well, I'll -- I'll give you an

example of a situation that is often trotted out as a

10

problem under our reading of the statute, and we think -­

11

the irony of it is, I think, none of the parties actually

12

think it's a problem, and I certainly don't, and that is,

13

the problem of a rule 20 plaintiff who is not listed in

14

(b).

15

But let's just say a -- a plaintiff comes in and

16

files a -- a complaint.

There is complete diversity.

17

Clever plaintiff says, aha, here I am.

18

through (a).

19

I'm a rule 20.

20

and I've got these folks who are not diverse and we're

21

going to bring them in.

We're in court.

I've gotten

Now, I'm in (b) and I am -­

I'm going to add some rule 20 plaintiffs,

22

Well, we -- we have cited cases, I think on page

23

24

I think, in its right mind is going to turn around 2 weeks

25

later and say, oh, you got me.

You know, we're going to

So supplemental

You come in.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly, but that's the reason

8

for saying that -- look, as I understand it -- and this is

9

-- the -- the thing that got me thinking they may have a

10

point here is A, B, and C are dealing with three separate

11

problems.

12

without affecting anything else like Zahn or any of the

13

others.

The first problem is how to overrule Finley

14

MR. AYER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

Kroger.

Well, we -- we disagree with that.
The second problem B is simply

B is how to make statutory Kroger.
And C is United Mine Workers v. Pennington to

18

make sure they have discretion to get rid of supplemental

19

jurisdiction.

20

Now, once you see it as three separate problems

21

-- I know they wanted me to see it this way, but once you

22

see it as three separate problems, the words fall into

23

place as long as you do interpret that word, civil action,

24

to mean, well, there is no jurisdiction over the civil

25

action where what's happened is you've simply added as a

2

plaintiff a nondiverse party or a party that doesn't meet

the jurisdictional amount.

5

Now, I spell all that out because I hope in the
next 15 minutes you will tell me why that's wrong.

6

MR. AYER:

Well, I -- we agree entirely with the

7

first part of what -- what Your Honor has said.

We -- we

8

agree completely that the complete diversity requirement,

9

which has been articulated so many times, means that when

10

you bring in a -- a nondiverse party, it destroys

11

jurisdiction.

12

or that I know of any other court that states that the

13

jurisdiction over the original action is destroyed.

14

There is not a single case from this Court

One of the things that was said here very -­

15

somewhat cleverly this morning is that in Zahn the -- the

16

case was not allowed to go forward because of the presence

17

of these other parties.

18

different times in Zahn the Court said these parties must

19

be dismissed.

20

whose claims are small.

21

oh, my goodness, we're going to lose jurisdiction over the

22

case.

23

of complete diversity, the court says, oh, my goodness, we

24

don't have jurisdiction.

25

That isn't what they said.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We can't hear any part of this.
Mr. Ayer, let -- maybe I'm

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

going to oversimplify to the point of the absurd but let

2

me try it.

3

The argument that you're answering is the

4

argument that there is no textual basis in (a) to

5

distinguish the geographical diversity requirement from

6

the amount-in-controversy requirement.

7

think, that when the drafters in (a) refer to action and

8

jurisdiction, those terms have to be understood

9

historically as we have understood them, and the

Your answer is, I

10

significance of a -- a geographical problem, which does

11

destroy jurisdiction traditionally, is different from an

12

amount-in-controversy problem which is -- which does not

13

and is dealt with more simply.

14

MR. AYER:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. AYER:

17

And -- and I would just like to go on and say

Is that your -­

That is correct, Your Honor.
Okay.

That is correct.

18

one other thing, and that is, this Court has written how

19

many hundreds I don't know, but hundreds of cases

20

articulating nuances -- and -- and I've learned how

21

remarkable they are, the nuances -- of law under 1332 and

22

under what amounts to a case within -- it's incredible how

23

complex the law that this Court has spelled out is under

24

1332.

25

Our view of the statute is that that body of law

Page 69

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has been preserved and it's been preserved in two places.

2

It has been preserved in the first clause of 1367(a),

3

which is really all that's at issue right here, and it's

4

also been -- been preserved in the last clause of 1367(b)

5

which says that -- that as to the list of enumerated

6

exceptions -- in essence, (b) says if you've got a case

7

within the original jurisdiction, then it says, with

8

regard to plaintiffs' claims against parties joined under

9

14, 19, 20, and 24 and with regard to claims brought by

10

persons to be joined under 19 or 24, then you don't have

11

supplemental jurisdiction if to do so would be

12

inconsistent with the requirements of jurisdiction under

13

1332.

14

What does that mean?

That means that those

15

excepted claims may not come in if they could not have

16

been brought in the case originally without destroying

17

original jurisdiction under 1332.

18

as our opponents I think read it, that the only time you

19

have supplemental jurisdiction over these claims is when

20

you already have 1332 jurisdiction over these claims.

21

That isn't supplemental jurisdiction.

22

absolutely no sense to read the statute that way.

23

So how do we read it?

It can't possibly mean,

It would make

We read it to say if

24

these are claims whose presence in the case at the

25

beginning would have destroyed the anchor that gets us

Page 70

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

into court, which is a case under 1332, then the whole

2

thing goes out the window.

3

And furthermore, I would say -- and again, this

4

is not an easy point to spell out in all of its nuances,

5

but at any point in the case, which will not be many and

6

won't be often -- but at any point in the case where this

7

Court's cases would say that you just lost jurisdiction

8

under 1332 -- and I say that's not often because basically

9

there's a time of filing rule and there are many, many, as

10

you all know better than I -- there are many nuances as to

11

what exceptions exist to that and what don't.

12

bottom line is if the case falls out of 1332 jurisdiction,

13

such as when the clever plaintiff tries to join a rule 20

14

compadre to come in and bring a nondiverse claim, goodbye.

15

You're out of court because -­

But the

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

thought was their view of -- of (b).

18

understand (b), you have to go back before Kroger.

19

Kroger was worried about some clever plaintiff, as you

20

say -­

21

MR. AYER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

See, that -- that's what I
To go to (b), you
And

Right.
-- getting a defendant.

He

23

knows this defendant is going to bring a third party

24

complaint against Smith from the same State, and he says,

25

ha, I'll sue this defendant.

Page 71

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And analogous things happen with rule 19 and 24,

2

not really with 20 they said, but 19 and 24.

3

Kroger says, hey, you can't do that.

4

MR. AYER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then

Right.
And so (b) was Judge Weis'

6

effort to make sure that was codified.

7

meant so much as some kind of exception from (a).

8

MR. AYER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11
12

It wasn't really

Right.
It was meant to have an

independent basis there.
So I didn't see, if you give it an independent
basis, how anything odd happens -­

13

MR. AYER:

Well -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. AYER:

-- by giving it their reading.

Well, I -- I just think that the

16

whole statute makes a very great deal of sense.

I mean,

17

one question is, does the first clause of (a) -- is -- is

18

that a gate you have to get through and once you get

19

through it, you're done?

20

think -- I think clearly you've got to have a case within

21

the original jurisdiction under 1332, and if you lose it,

22

the supplemental jurisdiction is a tail that falls off.

23

It -- it goes away.

I think the answer is no.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

you a question on your interpretation?

I

Mr. -- Mr. Ayer, may I ask
I think you were

Page 72

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- your position is that Clark against Paul Gray has been

2

overruled, and whatever one may say about the attention

3

that was focused on Zahn, Clark against Paul Gray has been

4

on the books since 1939.

5

Congress would have overruled that without even making a

6

peep to that effect.

7

MR. AYER:

And it seems unlikely that

Well, Clark, of course, is a Federal

8

question case.

9

there was an amount-in-controversy requirement.

10
11

Clark is a case at -- at the time when

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

It's about an amount­

in-controversy rule.

12

MR. AYER:

Right.

I -- I understand, Your

13

Honor.

I -- I think -- I mean, I -- I would -- it seems

14

to me that at the end of the day, we have to say that the

15

statute did what it did, and -- and if -- if it reversed

16

Zahn, it seems to me that it certainly reversed -­

17

reversed Clark, and frankly, we think the conclusion is

18

easier for all of the reasons based in the statute.

19

One thing I would like to do before -- before

20

the light goes off here is -- is talk a little bit about

21

the legislative history.

22

first -- in the first instance is that there really isn't

23

any reason to consider it because this is not a statute

24

that destroys complete diversity.

25

radical.

And of course, our position

It doesn't do anything

It actually is quite sensible and limited and

Page 73

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

clear when you read it.

2

to it.

3

So we don't think you need to go

But if the Court is going to go to it, we would

4

submit that there is a far more sensible way of thinking

5

about the legislative history than grabbing one sentence

6

out of the House report, which I'll talk about in a minute

7

as to what significance it really has anyway.

8
9

But essentially the sequence of events here -­
and I'll try to go through it quickly -- is that you -­

10

and as Mr. Stearns said, you have basically three versions

11

of this -- of this enactment.

12

little bit at the end.

13

The last one got tweaked a

The first version is the -- is the subcommittee

14

report.

And as he indicated, the subcommittee report,

15

which actually appears at page 14 and 15 of our brief, of

16

our yellow brief -- if you read the text of (a), which

17

appears on page 14, what you see is language which on its

18

face clearly does reverse Zahn, and then you have the

19

commentary that went with it in the working papers to the

20

subcommittee, and that commentary could not have been more

21

emphatic of -- of the intent to reverse Zahn.

22

The second enactment, which we have put in an

23

addendum to our yellow brief because it, frankly, plays

24

little role in the case in -- in thinking through the

25

statute, is the section 120 of House Resolution 5381.

And

Page 74

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

essentially when Congress -- it's quite correct that the

2

Federal Courts Study Committee did not specifically

3

endorse the subcommittee proposal.

4

saying it wasn't taking a position.

5

Congress, from somewhere a new enactment came forward onto

6

the floor or onto the committee that was addressing it,

7

and that's this provision in the addendum of our yellow

8

brief.

9

you look at that, number one, it looks entirely different.

It passed it along,
When it got to

And all I'm going to say about that is that when

10

Number two, it actually does a much poorer job of

11

preserving complete diversity, and it does, in fact,

12

explicitly overrule Owen Equipment v. Kroger.

13

Judge Weis came in and testified and said,

14

that's bad, don't do that.

15

more respect for complete diversity, and -- and you

16

shouldn't do that.

17

that's the end of 120.

18

You know, you've got to show

That got put into the ash can.

So

And the next thing he did, attached to his same

19

testimony, was -- was submit a proposal, which is in our

20

yellow brief at page 16.

21

we think you should enact.

22

(a) with the language of (a) in the enactment on page 14,

23

you will see that it's a couple lines longer.

24

few more embellishments and words, but it is substantively

25

indistinguishable, the provision in (a).

And this -- this is what we said
If you compare the language of

It has a

And so what we

Page 75

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have is Judge Weis putting forward a proposal that can't

2

be substantively distinguished from the one that the

3

subcommittee said, clearly correctly, would reverse Zahn.

4

The last question here is what happened then,

5

and what happened then to provision (a) -- there are

6

essentially three things that happened to this whole

7

provision that I'm aware of.

8

words, on a claim, and that's the argument that's

9

principally advanced here.

One is they took out the

They took those.

So it's

10

civil action on a claim.

11

also changed the last clause of (b) and they also changed

12

the reference in the supplemental jurisdiction from case

13

or -- from -- what is the -- the transaction or occurrence

14

to case or controversy.

15

They took out on a claim.

They

And those are all the changes.

We would submit that there is no basis to infer

16

from any of those things, and particularly not the first

17

one that dealt with (a), that they meant by dropping on a

18

claim to somehow say, oh, my goodness, you've got to have

19

jurisdiction over all of the claims before you.

20

Again, that is inconsistent with the Court's

21

opinion in City of Chicago.

22

way in City of Chicago if the presence of a

23

nonjurisdictional claim destroys original jurisdiction

24

over the civil action.

25

You can't come out the same

The last thing I -- I want to say about the -­

Page 76

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the jurisdiction which the other side relies upon -­

2

essentially it's a sentence that says there was no intent

3

to, quote, affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332

4

in diversity-only class actions.

5

a footnote to Zahn and Ben Hur.

6

there is that they talk about.

7

And then there's a cite,
That's pretty much what

Well, number one, as has been said, the authors

8

-- apparently the authors of that language, the ones who

9

put it in conceded that this legislative history was an

10

attempt to correct an oversight in the statute, which it

11

would have been better to have corrected in the statute.

12

We think that's significant.

13

But I would go beyond that and say that if you

14

just look at this language, no -- no intent to affect the

15

jurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only

16

class actions, number one, most importantly, we don't

17

think there's been a change in the requirements under

18

1332.

19

Court's entire body of 1332 jurisprudence in the first

20

line of -- of clause (a) and in the last line of clause

21

(b), and so it's all there.

22

This is supplemental jurisdiction additional to it.

23

And secondly, this is not a class action.

24

There's nothing in our case that relates to a class

25

action.

As I've said before, this statute engrafted this

No one has changed 1332.

That's an issue, if you think this is relevant,

Page 77

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you have to deal with in -- in the other case, but you

2

don't have to deal with it in our case.

3

I guess the last thing I would say about

4

legislative history is that we think probably the most

5

important legislative history here, other than the

6

tracking of these provisions, which we think is quite

7

indicative, is -- is that the -- the House report, among

8

other things, also said that what they were trying to do

9

was to provide, quote, a practical arena for the

10

resolution of an entire controversy.

And we think that in

11

the context of our case, as -- as has been pointed out

12

here already by Justice Ginsburg, it makes very little

13

sense to resolve our case by splitting it in two and

14

sending it to different courts.

15

Thank you very much.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank -- thank you, Justice

24

First of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about

25

the City of Chicago case, and Justice Ginsburg said this

Page 78

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sort of feels like a Finley type case in the -- in -- in

2

how it applies in the diversity context.

3

fundamental point here is that there is a very different

4

approach and there has always been a very different

5

approach to Federal question jurisdiction and to diversity

6

jurisdiction.

7

been claims-driven.

8

been party-driven.

9

1990 had to have understood that.

But the

Federal question jurisdiction has always
Diversity jurisdiction has always
And the Congress that enacted 1367 in
It's been the law for

10

as long as -- as we've had -- for the 200 years that

11

Strawbridge has been around, that distinction has -- has

12

existed.

13

And so we're not asking the Court to interpret

14

civil action differently in this particular statute.

15

We're asking the Court to focus on civil actions of which

16

the district court has jurisdiction.

17

all of the requirements of 1331 and 1332.

18

That incorporates

Second, Justice Breyer, I'm a little reluctant

19

to get into this rule 19, rule 24 to try -- but I think I

20

can help at least clarify at least some aspects of it.

21

Rule 19 by its terms excludes situations that

22

defeat jurisdiction.

So it says in the rule that if

23

you're bringing in a necessary party -- remember, this is

24

the defendant who is bringing in a necessary party -- if

25

it would defeat jurisdiction, you can't do it, and if it

Page 79

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

still is indispensable, you have to dismiss the entirety

2

of the case, which is precedent for the notion that

3

sometimes you have to dismiss the entirety of the case in

4

situations where you don't have jurisdiction over a

5

particular party.

6

But the -- the second question, rule 24.

I

7

think the standard is that you could bring in a rule 24

8

party within supplemental jurisdiction that doesn't defeat

9

anything with respect to the original civil action.

I

10

think that was the rule prior to 1367.

But to the extent

11

it was or wasn't, I think 1367(a) and (b) combine to allow

12

that to happen.

13

as a party, the plaintiff cannot bring a claim against

14

that -- that intervening party.

(b) then says that if someone intervenes

15

smaller cases out of Federal court that otherwise would be

And that's also a distinction between the Federal question

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's because the
