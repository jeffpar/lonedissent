ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA J. THOMPSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. THOMPSON:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case involves the proper application of the

11

categorical method of analysis that this Court prescribed

12

in Taylor against United States, and it involves the

13

application of that categorical method to what is

14

described as ambiguous burglary convictions obtained under

15

nongeneric burglary statutes with boiler plate complaints

16

and a general finding of guilty following a plea

17

proceeding.

18

At stake -­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what do you mean by a

20

-- just so we get our terms defined, what do you mean by a

21

nongeneric burglary statute -­

22

MS. THOMPSON:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

In this case -­
-- and a generic burglary

statute?
MS. THOMPSON:

Well, a generic burglary statute,

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

as -- as defined in the Taylor case is one that

2

criminalizes unlawful entry into a building or a structure

3

with intent to commit another crime.

4

elements of generic burglary.

5

State statute covers those three, it's considered generic

6

burglary and would then qualify as a predicate violent

7

felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

8

A nongeneric -­

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Those are the three

Those apply if any -- if a

Now, do you -- do you agree

10

that all the papers showing the arrest and the

11

investigation and so forth show that this was in fact a

12

building -­

13

MS. THOMPSON:

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

MS. THOMPSON:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

I do not.

MS. THOMPSON:

Does it show it was a

vehicle.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

MS. THOMPSON:

Or a boat?

It doesn't show that it was a

boat.

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

24

MS. THOMPSON:

25

I -- as this -­

It doesn't show that it was a

20

vehicle?

18
19

No.

Or a motorcycle?

It doesn't show that it was a

motorcycle.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

None of

the supporting documentation shows what it was?

3
4

It shows nothing?

MS. THOMPSON:

Those supporting documents do not

play a role in the adjudication.

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, that isn't my question.

6

I asked you whether any of them show that it was, in fact,

7

a building or a car or a boat.

8
9

MS. THOMPSON:

None of them shows that it was

anything other than a building.

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MS. THOMPSON:

12

Thank you.

The police reports and the

complaint applications, but the statute -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why -- why are you

14

resisting that the -- that the police report gave an

15

identified building?

16

one mustn't look behind, in the case of a guilty plea, to

17

find the police report or even the police application for

18

complaint.

19

the police reports in fact gave addresses of particular

20

buildings?

21

I mean, you're -- you're saying that

But there isn't any question, is there, that

MS. THOMPSON:

There is no question of that.

22

When you look at the police reports, if you read those

23

police reports, some of which you can actually read, they

24

do describe buildings and they describe addresses and

25

hallways and things like that.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what -- what you're saying

2

is the conviction itself didn't show that, and so the

3

question is whether you can look to documents that in fact

4

showed it.

5
6

MS. THOMPSON:

That's -- that's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So the rule you would have us

8

follow does result in a -- a super technicality in a sense

9

of what -- what was on the record at the time of the plea.

10

MS. THOMPSON:

Well, actually the district court

11

established that this was not on the record at the time of

12

the plea.

13

The statutes to -- that are underlying these convictions,

14

to get back to Justice Scalia's question, are nongeneric,

15

and they are nongeneric in the sense that they make it

16

unlawful to break into structures other than buildings or

17

in addition to buildings.

18

The district court took evidence on this issue.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose in the

19

earlier conviction, the police report is in the court.

20

It's not part of the record, and then the court says, I've

21

read the police report.

22

-- or the defendant says, yes.

23

and look at the police report even though it was not

24

annexed as part of the record?

25

MS. THOMPSON:

Is that accurate?

And the client

Then later, can we go back

Well, that calls into question

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

what kinds of documents can be examined in terms of making

2

a -- a determination as to whether this offense was

3

categorically a crime of violence, that is, that it was

4

generic burglary.

5

limitation, and the limitation is imposed by Taylor

6

itself, that the question being answered be made a

7

question of law, that it is a question of law, that it's a

8

matter of law that you make the determination.

9

It's our position that there's a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the defendant at the

10

plea colloquy had said, yes, I entered X building or even

11

in the plea bargain had said that, even though the charge

12

just read the boiler plate, the whole statute, buildings,

13

vessels, et cetera, if he had admitted it either in the

14

plea colloquy or in the plea bargain, wouldn't that be

15

enough?

16

MS. THOMPSON:

If we had a contemporaneous

17

record of the adjudication of this conviction that showed

18

an actual admission to breaking into a building, I believe

19

that that would satisfy a sort of modified Taylor

20

categorical approach.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I don't understand your

22

reading of Taylor.

As I've read that case many times, it

23

seemed to me that that was making a perfectly sensible

24

point.

25

you know, there are some States like Massachusetts, for

At the end of the opinion, Justice Blackmun says,

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say

2

burglary of a -- of a ship or a car or a building.

3

that leads us to answer a more general question.

4

context, that more general question is whether you ought

5

to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to

6

see if there was really violence or not.

And he says no.

7

Just look to the definition of the crime.

That's what he

8

says.

9

And

Well, in

That will end it.
Now, he says we agree, because I started here,

10

that we have a couple of States with some weird statutes,

11

and what you have to do in those States is you won't know

12

if it's a boat or a car or -- so he says, for example, in

13

a State like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us

14

with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's

15

what you do.

16

fact of conviction.

17

or information and jury instructions.

That isn't a

18

limiting phrase.

He just thought

19

that in those cases, that's what -- all you'll have to

20

look to, for example.

21

It says you may have to go beyond the mere
So he says go look to the indictment

That's for example.

We happen to have an unusual case where there

22

are no jury instructions because he pled guilty.

So

23

what's the harm of going looking to the documents that

24

will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on

25

these pieces of paper show?

There are no boats, you know,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

in Watertown.

It's not a dock, I don't think, or at least

2

not in that part of it.

3

problem here?

So -- so I mean, what's the

4

MS. THOMPSON:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Well, the -Why is everyone so mixed up?

I

must be missing something.

7

MS. THOMPSON:

The example that's given, the

8

charging document and jury instructions -- let's suppose

9

that instead of -- of guilty pleas, Mr. Shepard was tried

10

and he was tried on this nongeneric, boiler plate

11

complaint, and there were no jury instructions available.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's the problem?

I grant

13

you I could imagine a case that could be a problem.

14

it was a houseboat.

Maybe

Okay?

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or maybe it's like a trailer.

17

So if we run into that case, we'll deal with it.

18

know, I'm perfectly capable of thinking that if this is a

19

charge where there is a dispute on the contested point,

20

fine, we won't take that dispute into account, maybe

21

decide it in the favor of the defendant, maybe.

22

is not that case.

23

You

But this

And by the way, if he's going to say, how do you

24

know?

I'd say, I know.

I know Boston and I also know

25

that breaking into a boat at least is unusual.

So if he

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

thinks it wasn't that, let him say so.

2

MS. THOMPSON:

The district court did actually

3

entertain this issue, Justice Breyer, and what they -­

4

what the district court found was there wasn't an

5

opportunity, there wasn't a reason for Mr. Shepard to

6

contest building or any other element of this offense.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, of course, there wasn't.

8

So all he has to do now is say, Judge, in my latest thing,

9

you know, they say 30 Bremer Street.

30 Bremer Street

10

sounds like the address of a building, but by the way,

11

unusually enough, it's the license plate of a car.

12

Now, if in fact that's the case, he can come in

13

and say it.

14

talking about sentencing and what a prior conviction was.

15

He doesn't even have to say it.

16

tell us.

17
18

You as his lawyer could

Because it isn't conceivably right.
MS. THOMPSON:

Well, and it also isn't in fact.

And the question here is --

21
22

We're

Now, you know why I think you don't say it?

19
20

There's no Fifth Amendment problem.

JUSTICE BREYER:
in fact?

What do you mean it isn't right

What is it?

23

MS. THOMPSON:

Is it in law --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MS. THOMPSON:

Yes.

-- or in fact that we are trying

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

to make this determination?

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

We look to facts about what the

3

prior convictions were about.

4

That, of course, is a fact, but it's a legal fact, what

5

was this conviction for.

6
7

MS. THOMPSON:

10

Taylor said you don't look at

facts -­

8
9

That's what Taylor says.

JUSTICE BREYER:
it.

I understand your reading of

What I want to know is what's wrong with my reading

of it.

11

MS. THOMPSON:

Because your reading of it

12

requires a look at the underlying conduct.

13

requires.

14

exhibit the underlying conduct is as far away as you can

15

get from an adjudicatory document.

16

It actually

And the document here that was selected to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

What -- is -- is

17

your argument that we are likely, in effect, to -- to

18

violate some constitutional standard if we do what the

19

Government wants, or is your argument as follows?

20

Taylor says this is an offense-based not a fact-based

21

determination.

22

getting at.

23

here, you basically will have gone beyond offense-based.

24

You will have gone -- become fact-based and you will be

25

violating the statute.

That

Taylor says that's what the statute is

And if you go as far as the Government wants

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

So my question is, is there something

2

constitutionally we have to worry about which is the basis

3

for your argument, or is it a violation of the statute

4

that you think we ought to be worried about?

5
6

MS. THOMPSON:

that was violated, but you are correct, Justice Souter --

7
8

In this case it's the statute

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I don't have a position.

I can't -­

9

MS. THOMPSON:

-- that -- no.

You are correct

10

in representing that the Government's approach to this

11

will take what is quintessentially a question of law, that

12

is, a comparison of adjudicated elements of -- adjudicated

13

elements of conviction against -- compared to the elements

14

of generic burglary.

15

match?

16

That's a question of law.

Do they

Do they not match?
It becomes a question of fact then, as the First

17

Circuit put it in Shepard and in the Harris case, to

18

determine what was actually in the mind of the defendant

19

at the time he entered his plea.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, aren't we asking that

21

question in -- in any case?

The question ultimately is,

22

what did he mean when he said I am guilty?

23

a plea colloquy, as you admitted a moment ago, it's easy

24

to find out what he meant because they would have gone

25

into the factual basis for the plea.

If you've got

If there's a written

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

plea agreement, it's probably going to be easy to find out

2

because, again, there would be a basis for the plea set

3

out.

4

Here, there isn't one of those documents.

So

5

you're going one step further, but you're still asking the

6

question what did he mean when he stood in that courtroom

7

and said I am guilty.

8

fact-based, but all of those questions are fact-based.

9

They're going to the same issue.

And yes, in -- in one sense that's

10

was pleading guilty to?

11

MS. THOMPSON:

What did he mean?

What

Isn't that correct?
Well, because it's based on an

12

examination of the underlying conduct, which is forbidden

13

by the Taylor decision -­

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, maybe, maybe not.

15

That's kind of the question we have, how -- what gloss to

16

put on Taylor.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

saying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- Taylor were not on the

2

books.

What -- what would be the basis of your argument?

3

You say that it's all right to look at a plea colloquy,

4

but it's not all right to look at an arrest report to

5

which the judge referred.

6

distinction?

7

What's the basis for that

What sense does it make?

MS. THOMPSON:

The sense it makes it this.

What

8

the Armed Career Criminal Act addresses and what this

9

Court discussed in Taylor was the applicable term is

10

conviction, that is, a conviction for a categorical

11

offense.

12

specifically described as burglary, arson, but there are

13

specifically described crimes.

14

can determine as a matter of law.

15

the -- the generically violent crime, or do they not match

16

the generically violent crime?

17

generically violent crime, you might still be able to

18

figure out, you might be able to surmise what the

19

defendant actually had in his mind, if he had anything in

20

his mind, about this at the time of the guilty plea.

21

The categorical offense is a crime of violence

Those are things that you
Do the elements match

If they do not match the

Well, one of the unique things about the -­

22

these nongeneric burglary statutes in Massachusetts is

23

that they're really relatively petty offenses.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but why can you look at

what's in the plea colloquy that's in the record, but you

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

cannot look at a document that the judge referred to, if

2

that document isn't there?

3

sense argument that you're making?

4

understand it.

5
6
7

MS. THOMPSON:

What's -- what's the common
I -- I don't

Well, there is no evidence in

this case that the judge referred to a police report.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

This is my little

8

hypothetical case so that we can test your theory, just to

9

see the reasons that you're advancing for -- for us to

10

rule in your favor.

11

that you've given us.

12

And I -- I don't see any rationale

MS. THOMPSON:

If you can look at the colloquy

13

and the judge, without incorporating it, has the defendant

14

explicitly admit the facts that constitute the elements of

15

generic burglary, it is our position that that -- that

16

conviction could be used to enhance.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me try the same question.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but why can't you go

But --

19

one step further and refer to the document that was not in

20

the record but that the judge mentioned in his -- in his

21

findings at the first sentencing?

22

had a reason why.

23

MS. THOMPSON:

Why?

I still haven't

I agree that whether or not that

24

document is in the record, if there is an explicit finding

25

or an admission by the court that enters the judgment,

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the defendant broke and entered a building, that that

2

conviction should be able to qualify as a predicate under

3

the Armed Career Criminal Act.

4

that the underlying document be incorporated into the

5

record, only that the admission be made or the facts be

6

found by the fact-finder, whoever is taking the plea.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is not a requirement

May I ask you a question?

8

Assume the case had been tried and you could not tell from

9

either the indictment or the instructions to the jury

10

whether it was a generic burglary or a nongeneric

11

burglary.

12

the transcript of the trial to answer that question?

13

Would the -- our decision permit us to look at

MS. THOMPSON:

Certainly not under Taylor.

The

14

whole idea of Taylor was partly dictated by the words of

15

the statute.

16
17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So your argument is that this

is comparable to using the transcript of the trial.

18

MS. THOMPSON:

This is -- it -- well, I don't

19

think it's comparable because the district court finding

20

was that the documents that the Government relies on were

21

not involved in the adjudication at all.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it -­

So this is even farther

removed.
MS. THOMPSON:

This is even farther removed than

a plea colloquy, farther removed than a trial transcript

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

looking into the evidence -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's what I don't

3

understand.

We're now talking about that part of Taylor

4

which deals with a narrow statute where our object is not

5

to find out what he's guilty of or anything.

6

trying to find out what was the crime he was charged with.

7

And there are two or three States which lump together in

8

one statute crimes that are violent and nonviolent.

9

Burglary of a structure is violent.

10

a ship is not.

11

charge at issue.

12

We're just

Burglary of a car or

So all we want to know is what was the

Now, do you -- let me break the question into

13

two parts.

14

example, in a State whose burglary statutes include entry

15

of an automobile, as well as a building, if the indictment

16

or information and jury instructions show that the

17

defendant was charged only with burglary of a building,

18

then it's going to be violent.

19

The key sentence here, I think, is for

Now, would you -- would you agree with me or not

20

that he could have written -- Justice Blackmun -- that

21

same sentence to say if, for example, the indictment or

22

information and jury instructions show?

23

willing to add those two words, for example?

24

MS. THOMPSON:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would you be

If, for example.
If, for example.

I want to

know how -- how absolute you're making this.

2

example.

3

If, for

And the next question I'd ask would be if you

agree for example, what are the things you can look to and

5

what are the things you can't?

Yes, but do you want add the

for example or do you want to take it just categorically?

10

MS. THOMPSON:

Well, I do believe that the best

11

reading is the categorical reading.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. THOMPSON:

14

But I'm willing to accept for

15
16

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Then what kinds of

things would you -­

MS. THOMPSON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

kinds of things not?

he charged with, which of these three things.

21

All we're interested in is what was

MS. THOMPSON:

And all Taylor and the Armed

22

Career Criminal Act are interested in is what was he

convicted of.

JUSTICE BREYER:
later.

No, no, no.

Let me deal with the charge.

I will get that

If he was charged

with breaking into a boat, that's the end of this.

MS. THOMPSON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

what he was charged with.

True.
So, fine.

So I want to know

Let me do that one.

Now, what will you let me look to to see what he
was charged with?

7
8

Okay?

MS. THOMPSON:

You can look to the charging

document and the statute to see what he was charged with.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So what happens in

10

the case where -- Justice Blackmun let us go further than

11

that.

12

13

let us look to a jury instruction as if there's actually

14

been a trial.

15

He says the indictment -- that's the charging
He'll

So he'll let us go further than you will.

MS. THOMPSON:

Not to determine what he was

16

charged with.

To determine what he was convicted of.

17

Because the jury instructions are not going to be

18

factually oriented.

19

tell you what the element of the crime was, elements that

20

were adjudicated.

21

with a nongeneric document here -- the nongeneric statute,

22

a boat, a house, a whatever, and the jury instructions

23

establish for you that he could not have been convicted by

24

that jury without finding a house because that's the

25

elements laid out in the jury instruction -­

The jury instructions are going to

So that if you have the person charged

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what's the difference

2

between that and a police report that makes it quite clear

3

that in the circumstances there was no possibility of a

4

boat or a car being involved?

5

between that and the police report?

6

MS. THOMPSON:

What's the difference

The police report does not show

7

you what the results of the adjudication was.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

It does not

What shows us that -- what

shows us that is --

11

MS. THOMPSON:

The elements.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is the check mark.

No.

The

13

check mark on the form that says, for example, plea, admit

14

sufficient facts.

15

on the form.

16

could have different things checked.

17

established the guilt.

18

You know, that's a check mark or it's

It says plea, guilty.

I mean, you know, you
So that's what

And then the police report establishes whether

19

-- what kind of a thing was at issue.

And I will agree

20

with you that if it's at all contested, we shouldn't get

21

into it.

22

There was no boat around there.

23

there was no car.

24

that's just as good as the jury instruction.

25

Tell me why not.

But if it's not contested, there's no question.
It's a city street.

It's plain it was a building.

Or

Then

Why not?

MS. THOMPSON:

Well, I suggest that it doesn't

2

tell you anything about what's actually been adjudicated.

3

What it tells you, it's what's actually been charged.

4

And here's one of the things that came up in the

5

district court in front of Judge Gertner, and the

6

Government brought up this as well as Judge -- as the

7

district court judge.

8

said, yes, I broke into the property of another person

9

with intent to commit a crime?

What if Mr. Shepard went in and

That would be a factual

10

basis that would be adequate for the -- for any sentence

11

that could be imposed under that statute.

12

because of the fact that the boat, the house, the car, and

13

the vessel are all put on the same level, the operative

14

fact is is it yours, Mr. Shepard.

15

you, Mr. Shepard?

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because the -­

Does that belong to

I mean, but that's always true.

17

You could have a -- you could have a -- a sheet that

18

shows:

19

sheet says, it says:

20

possible, for all we know, that when the actual colloquy

21

took place, he was talking about some other thing.

22

don't know what he was talking about, but what you'd go

23

upon is that there was a charge and he pleaded guilty to

24

the charge.

25

admitted, assault, you know.

And -- and what the

charge, assault; plea, guilty.

MS. THOMPSON:

It's

I

Which brings me to Henderson

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

against Morgan.

One of the issues in Henderson against

2

Morgan is whether or not you can infer guilt of an element

3

that is not specifically charged even from overwhelming

4

evidence, that that could be proved.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I don't -- good.

Are you

6

going to explain this?

Because I thought what we were

7

supposed to do is just look to the sheet, charge; the

8

plea, guilty.

9

98 percent of the cases.

And that is what we do and it disposes of

10

MS. THOMPSON:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

talking about those 98 percent now?

13

MS. THOMPSON:

It does.
All right.

So -- so are you

I'm talking about the -- the 2

14

percent that are nongeneric burglary.

15

percent that are nongeneric burglary, the issue that is

16

raised, by the fact that it's nongeneric burglary, is you

17

can't make a determination based on the face of the record

18

of what was actually adjudicated, that this person was

19

actually found guilty of each element of generic burglary.

20

And when you cannot make that determination from record

21

documents and contemporaneous documents with the

22

adjudication, then you cannot make that determination

23

under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

determination?

And in those 2

Why can't you make the

Isn't the -- the problem that your

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

determination may not be as reliable?

2

And I thought ultimately your argument would

3

boil down to saying this.

The reason you will accept the

4

plea colloquy or the plea agreement, if it sets out the

5

facts, is that that is very reliable.

6

indication of what he was pleading guilty to and what the

7

court was finding him guilty of.

8

that and you start looking into police reports appended to

9

complaints or whatnot, you're getting into an area of less

It is a reliable

But once you go beyond

10

reliability, and when we're dealing with sentence

11

enhancements like this, we better be reliable.

12

the statute based it on -- on offense rather than facts.

13

Don't get into a factual determination that is unreliable.

14

I thought that was your argument ultimately.

15

MS. THOMPSON:

That's why

That -- that is part of the

16

argument, and I -- I think that we're just using different

17

terms here.

18

court and the -- and the Armed Career Criminal Act use

19

conviction.

You're using offense, and -- and the Taylor

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MS. THOMPSON:

I -- I'll accept that, yes.

Okay.

And so when you're talking

22

about a conviction, you're talking about something that

23

has already been established, that you should be able to

24

make a determination by looking at the contemporaneous

25

documents.

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you -- you still haven't

2

given a reason, other than the one Justice Souter accepts.

3

Look it.

4

is, but you want to argue that we shouldn't find that out.

5

And it seems to me you have to give us a rationale for we

6

shouldn't know the truth here.

7

to find it, and there must be some reasons for that.

8

the law does that once in a while.

9

something happened, but the law is supposed to pretend it

This is a case where we all know what the truth

10

didn't.

11

know that.

12

should adopt your theory.

13

You -- you don't want us
And

We all know that

That's why Justice has a blindfold on.

I -- I

But you haven't given me one reason yet why I

MS. THOMPSON:

Well, the theory that I'm

14

proposing is -- is I believe the theory that's already

15

been adopted by this Court, which is the -- the one

16

described in Taylor.

17

says you cannot make a determination of what elements were

18

adjudicated by looking at the underlying conduct.

19

It's the categorical approach that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why is a categorical

20

determination important?

I threw you a -- a bone a second

21

ago, and I said maybe it's because of -­

22

MS. THOMPSON:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24
25

that it?

It's -­
-- a reliability concern.

Is

Is that your point?
MS. THOMPSON:

It is reliable and it's also not

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

fact-based.

2

Once you start to -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but is -- is your point

3

that once you get beyond the documents that you admit we

4

can look at, there is a higher -- an -- an unacceptably

5

high risk of unreliability?

6

MS. THOMPSON:

Is that your argument?

That is one of my arguments,

7

Justice Souter, and the -- and there's something that goes

8

hand in glove with that and did in this case.

9

shifts then to the defendant.

The burden

The burden shifts to the

10

defendant to prove that he was not convicted of generic

11

burglary, and that -­

12
13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but that -- that doesn't

necessarily follow.

14

MS. THOMPSON:

-- assignment -­

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that doesn't necessarily

16

follow from -- from looking at a police report.

It may

17

well be that we would say the burden never shifts, and he

18

is simply in the position of any other party to a case.

19

If -- if the other side has put in evidence that is -- is

20

against his interest and he does nothing, then he's in

21

trouble.

But that isn't the same as shifting the burden.

22

MS. THOMPSON:

Well, it -­

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's no -- I guess all I'm

24

saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the

25

Government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts.

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Isn't that correct?

2

MS. THOMPSON:

What shifts is the risk of being

3

wrong.

The shifts -- the risk of being wrong right now is

4

on the Government.

5

that the defendant was convicted of generic burglary, it

6

bears that responsibility.

establish that back when he entered his plea -­

If the Government cannot establish

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If the defendant cannot

Yes, but the Government -­
Ms. Thompson, you know your

white light is on.

So if you want to save time, you

should perhaps do so right now.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MR. ELWOOD:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
When a defendant has been convicted under a

19

State statute that prohibits both burglary of a building

20

and burglary of a car or some other item, the Court can

21

still look to the conviction to determine whether it is an

22

Armed Career Criminal Act predicate when, as here, the

23

police report indicates the defendant was arrested for

24

burglarizing a building rather than a ship or a car and

25

the other documents in the file corroborate that the basis

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

for the plea was the crime outlined in the police report.
Because two of the three elements of generic

3

burglary -- that is, breaking and entering and intent to

4

commit a crime -­

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

6

Suppose the police report had been ambiguous and referred

7

to both a boat and a house.

8

it be -- what would you do in that case?

9

MR. ELWOOD:

What would -- could -- would

I think in a case where the police

10

report was ambiguous about what it is that the person

11

broke into, I think that you could not base the

12

enhancement on that.

13

police report is unambiguous and the documents recording

14

the guilty plea suggest -­

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We are asking only when both the

But why -- why couldn't you

16

use it in the other case?

Couldn't you ask the police

17

officer what he -- who conducted the investigation what

18

the facts really were?

19

MR. ELWOOD:

I think you might be able to -­

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you'd start out with the

21

premise that 90 percent of these cases are really houses

22

anyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the

23

Government?

24
25

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I think that you could talk

about introducing extrinsic evidence of -- of that sort.

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

We're not asking the Court to go that far, and I think in

2

the run-up cases -­

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the -- the question in this

4

case is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence,

5

isn't it?

6

MR. ELWOOD:

I don't think so in this case

7

because the police report is in -- in a police file

8

itself.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, suppose that it was an

10

assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to

11

decide whether it was violent or not, and the police

12

report was somewhat ambiguous.

13

look at it then.

14

MR. ELWOOD:

Could you -- you couldn't

No, and I don't think you could for

15

an additional reason, which is that I don't think assault

16

and battery is necessarily a -- is a necessary element of

17

the -- of -- of -- I'm sorry.

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's a distinction between

violent assaults and -­

20

MR. ELWOOD:

Right, violent and nonviolent.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

MR. ELWOOD:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- nonviolent assaults.

Exactly right.
And you might want to find out

24

which one it was and -- and as here, it seems pretty easy.

25

Everybody knows most burglaries are -- are of houses.

But

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

I'm just wondering if we're not trying to find out what

2

the categorical rule is that -- that is at stake here.

3

MR. ELWOOD:

The only rule we are advocating is

4

that when we are talking about a necessary element of the

5

offense that can be satisfied in different ways, that you

6

can look to the police report to indicate which way it was

7

met in this case if the rest of the file, the State court

8

file, indicates that the police report was the -- provided

9

the factual basis or provided the basis for the

10

conviction.

11
12

And I think if you look at the file in this
case, for example, for four of the defendant's -­

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

basis for the conviction.

15

in each of these cases?

16

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, you say it provided the
Was it presented to the court

We believe that the record

17

indicates that it was.

For four of the defendant's

18

convictions, if you look at the document that records the

19

guilty plea, it -- it says -- in addition to the notation

20

of guilty, and as Justice Breyer averred, a check of admit

21

sufficient facts or that there are sufficient facts

22

present, it lists the same date of the offense, the same

23

street address, the same arresting officer, and the same

24

victim.

25

certainly very strongly -- it supports a very strong

And it is our submission that that implies

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

inference -- that the crime of conviction was the very

2

same crime that is described in the police report.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Judge Gertner said

4

she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police

5

report.

6

was her position, that these are untested documents.

7

don't know one way or another whether the judge that

8

accepted the plea had seen them.

9

MR. ELWOOD:

It wasn't attached to the charge.

I thought that
We

To begin with, Judge Gertner looked

10

only to -- she didn't draw any inference based on the

11

document recording the guilty plea and what happened.

12

looked only to the direct evidence of what happened in the

13

colloquy, i.e., the petitioner's affidavit.

But even more than that, her only finding was

15

that the police report, as a police report, was not

16

introduced at the plea colloquy.

17

exhibit.

18

introduced as that.

19

with the idea that as is often the case and is probably

20

usually the case, that the police report was synopsized by

21

the prosecutor and -- and read at court, which would

22

explain why the offense of conviction has the same offense

23

date, same street address, same victim, same arresting

24

officer.

25

It wasn't marked as an

It wasn't attached to anything.

It wasn't

I don't think that's inconsistent

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we don't have any

colloquy.

2

saying it's -- it's altogether likely that that happened,

3

but we don't know.

4

We don't know what happened at the -- you're

MR. ELWOOD:

But we do know that under

5

Massachusetts State law, that there -- before a court can

6

accept a guilty plea, there has to be a factual basis in

7

the record.

8

support every element of the offense.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There have to be facts in the record to

So if the defendant says,

10

yes, I plead guilty to this crime and the crime is

11

described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's -- if

12

that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that

13

just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, I

14

did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than

15

violate the statute.

16

MR. ELWOOD:

The requirement -- the factual

17

basis requirement requires a statement of the facts, not a

18

statement of the legal conclusion, and simply reading the

19

charging document as a legal conclusion about what it -­

20

about a boat, building, et cetera was broken into.

21

it requires is a narrative description of the underlying

22

conduct so that the judge can satisfy him or herself to

23

what the defendant is pleading guilty to is actually a

24

crime.

25

document, if the underlying facts were he broke into a

If he just says, I agree with the charging

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

grocery cart or a -- a refrigerator shipping box or

2

something, it might not satisfy the elements of the crime.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But couldn't the judge in that

4

colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building,

5

a car, or a boat?

6

wouldn't that have satisfied the element of the crime?

7

And he would have said yes, and

MR. ELWOOD:

I don't -- I don't think it would

8

have satisfied the factual basis requirement in that there

9

has to be a narrative description of what the defendant

10

did, like he showed up at that day and he broke into 258

11

Norwell Street.

12

case where a -- a guilty plea was accepted based on

13

basically just a recitation of the charging document -­

14
15

And I have yet to find a Massachusetts

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, there's no record here

of the colloquy at the plea?

16

MR. ELWOOD:

No.

Is that it?

There's -- there's no facts -­

17

there's no -- as is the case often in guilty pleas, which

18

are not challenged on appeal, no colloquy was ever

19

prepared and apparently the tape recording was destroyed.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

not there's reliable record evidence?

22

test?

23

MR. ELWOOD:

But your test is whether or
Is that -- that the

Yes, whether there's reliable

24

record evidence that is reliable in describing what the

25

offense was that was the subject of the plea colloquy.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

And in this case, we believe it is met both because the

2

police report is unambiguous, as several of the members of

3

the Court have averred to, and that the documents

4

recording the guilty plea I think very clearly indicate

5

that the thing that was at issue was the crime described

6

in the police report.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

to the police report?

9

MR. ELWOOD:

Does it -- does the plea refer

No, it does not.

It doesn't in so

10

many words refer to the police report, but it refers to -­

11

it -- it, I think, unambiguously describes the crimes

12

described in the police report and that it involves, as I

13

said, the same date, the same street address, the same

14

victim, and the same arresting officer.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Where do you draw the line?

16

Is there some -- I -- I take it that you say certainly if

17

the plea colloquy or the -- or the judge's guilt

18

determination refers to the police report, then the police

3

I think that you would probably have to have a stronger

4

showing in order to say, well, he pleaded guilty to the

6

report or more of an indication on the guilty plea form, a

7

notation of -- of what was entered or -­

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, you mentioned -­

10

indicated the police report provided the factual basis for

there has to be both an -- that the police report is

is more likely than not that the police report provided

23

the factual basis for the plea, and if it's -- if there's

24

no reference to it in so many words, I think the same

could be said this -- that the same could be said here in

You just draw that inference from the fact that the crime

described looks like the crime described in the police

report.

It doesn't say we look to the police report.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is your -- what rule

6

would you have here?

The question is, was he convicted of

7

a crime of violence?

98 percent of the cases, all you

8

have to do is look to the crime charged, burglary, and the

9

fact that he was convicted.

He pleaded guilty or didn't.

But there are these two -- three States I guess

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if we don't get to the

5

outer reaches, the next case I suppose will involve a -­

6

an application for a search warrant or an arrest warrant

7

which describes facts and pretty well tells you what

8

really happened.

9

Could you rely on that?

MR. ELWOOD:

No.

Because the -- the important

10

thing is not just describing what actually happened, but

11

what -- what happened on the day the guilty plea was

taken.

MR. ELWOOD:

The police report was prepared

victim, and involving the same arresting officer.

to the police report.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me we're dealing

3

with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently

4

ambiguous that you have to look to something else.

5

the question is what other things may you look to, and you

6

say we can look to police reports.

7

warrant applications or maybe the prosecutor's notes, or

there could be other equally reliable documents available,

it would seem to me, that would -- which establish the

to look at -- the -- the fact that these are present in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought the police reports

MR. ELWOOD:

They are present in the court's

It seems to me that there's a -- a

MR. ELWOOD:

If -- I -- I think that if the

documents recording the guilty plea indicate that the -­

that the crime described is the crime described in the

11

warrant application, you probably could look at that if -­

12

to determine if it was a boat or a building or -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's say the warrant

radio and the charge does indicate that he was -- that -­

that the -- that the property taken in the burglary was a

18

saying, okay, the warrant application probably discloses

19

what was going on here?

20

on the warrant application, a radio in the burglary charge

to which he did plead guilty, probably it's the radio at

about the warrant application, though, strikes me as -- as

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

a little bit more attenuated, though, also because it's

done in advance of the police arriving on the scene and

discovering what's going on whereas the police report -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

reason to infer that it provided the basis for the plea -­

for the plea colloquy, which it is in this case because -­

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I guess you would be

content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the

plea colloquy in court.

15

MR. ELWOOD:

That's correct.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

would make the assumption, apparently, that on that

occasion the elements, the factual basis for the plea

would have been disclosed.

has been destroyed.

21

MR. ELWOOD:

But unfortunately, the record

It has been destroyed, but

22

Massachusetts State law requires that there be a factual

basis before the court can accept a guilty plea.

24

think we can -- under the presumption of regularity that

25

attaches to guilty pleas, you can presume that occurred.

And I

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

You can just presume that the

proceeding was regular and it was disclosed.

right?

4

Is that

Is -- under Massachusetts law is there any

difference in the penalty at all for burglary of a house

versus a motorcycle versus a car versus a vessel?

They're all

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you want us to write the

opinion that we can presume that what's in the State

12

investigative files and records was likely before the

trial court?

I -- I'd like to know what --

14

MR. ELWOOD:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16
17

I don't think it -­
I don't know what I'm supposed

to write.
MR. ELWOOD:

That when the -- basically when the

18

police report is unambiguous and when the documents in the

19

State court file indicate that the basis for the guilty

20

plea was the crime described in the police report, that

21

you can infer that the factual basis for the plea, which

22

is required under Massachusetts law, was in fact the

23

breaking into a building as opposed to a ship or a

24

vehicle and so forth.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Elwood, can I tell you

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

what's troubling me about that?

Maybe the whole

2

categorical approach is unwise.

It may have been more

3

strict than it should be.

4

notion that in a case that's been tried to verdict, you

5

can only look at the indictment and the instructions, as I

6

understand Justice Blackmun's opinion.

7

at the testimony in the record, even though there are nine

8

witnesses who described what happened.

9

that might be much more reliable than a police report.

10

And I'm just wondering am I correct, do you think, on

11

saying you cannot look at the testimony in the tried case?

12

And if so, how do you -- how do you say that police

13

reports are better than sworn witnesses?

14

MR. ELWOOD:

But it -- I'm puzzled by the

You could not look

It seems to me

I think to me it's not 100 percent

15

clear whether when Taylor referred to the jury

16

instructions and the charging documents, that that was

17

exhaustive of the jury trial conflict.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's a for example thing.

19

MR. ELWOOD:

20

But I think that if you were going -- it's still

Right.

It could be something else.

21

possible to draw the distinction based on an

22

administrability factor, which is the way many courts have

23

looked at it, which is you don't want to have to have the

24

court look back to transcripts of the whole thing versus

25

-- for the whole trial, whereas if they can look at a

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

discrete body of documents and say yes, this guy pleaded

2

guilty to burglary of a building, that you can reach that

3

conclusion.

4

line of testimony with the documents.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's a line of administrability, not a -- a

The thing I'm just questioning

6

is whether this rule that you -- you're advocating is

7

really more administrable than one that just says it seems

8

crazy in this particular case.

9

of having a categorical administrative rule, we'll simply

10

say whatever the public record shows and the proceedings

11

themselves.

12

MR. ELWOOD:

But -- but in the interest

I think that it has proven

13

administrable.

14

of courts allow you to look at court documents in order to

15

determine what was -- what sort of offense was at issue

16

and -- and that --

17

And it -- it -- I think that the majority

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How should we interpret

18

Taylor?

19

suggested this morning by Justice Breyer, for example?

20

Do you -- do you agree with the interpretation

MR. ELWOOD:

I think it's definitely should be

21

interpreted to include guilty pleas because taking Taylor

22

literally, I mean, they only discussed jury trials.

23

every court with criminal jurisdiction, every court of

24

appeals with criminal jurisdiction, has concluded that it

25

includes guilty pleas.

But

And so I think it -- it does make

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

sense.

I don't think that the Court would have in such a

2

short section of the opinion have exhaustively addressed

3

the entire scope of factual situations, and I don't think

4

it would have addressed the circumstance under which most

5

guilty pleas -- or rather, under which most convictions

6

are obtained -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then -- but reading it

8

that way, which is arguable, this case, but reading it

9

that way, you'd say you can look -- what we're interested

10

in is not what happened.

We are interested in what kind

11

of a crime was at issue.

And where it's difficult to

12

decide what crime is at issue, you can look to whatever

13

official documents are there at the time, any court

14

records, to make that determination, but there -- if there

15

is any indication that they're -- they're contested, if

16

there's any dispute as to what was at issue, then you

17

can't count it.

18

as a rule?

20
21

Then it doesn't count.

MR. ELWOOD:

What about that

I -- I think that is a sensible

I mean, basically our rule -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

So you'd say there's -- you can

22

look to what Justice Stevens says.

You can look to what

23

is official in that record that seems to have indication

24

of reliability, and if there is any indication at all that

25

this was a matter in dispute, you can't count the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

conviction.

That would be the rule.

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I think that would be a

3

sensible rule.

4

not only are the police reports unambiguous, but there's a

5

very strong reason to believe that they were the basis for

6

the guilty plea as it was obtained on that day.

7

And in this case, as -- as we indicated,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Elwood, we had a case

8

last term involving a search warrant, Groh against

9

Ramirez, and it -- it was very clear that the application

10

for the warrant identified specifically what the police

11

were to search for, but the warrant itself didn't.

12

this Court held you couldn't look behind that blank

13

warrant for the particulars that were revealed in the

14

warrant application.

15

sense that we have the conviction and you're saying, but

16

you can look behind that conviction to something that, we

17

don't know, may or may not have been before the court.

18

MR. ELWOOD:

And

And I suppose this is similar in the

As I recall Groh, that case

19

specifically turned on the fact that the face of the

20

Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant describe, not

21

that the supporting documents describe, the place to be

22

searched and the items to be seized.

23

case we already know it's okay to look behind convictions

24

because Taylor itself says so.

25

items are acceptable, and -­

And I think in this

The only question is what

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, Taylor -- Taylor

2

doesn't quite have this full for example because there's

3

another paragraph following the for example paragraph

4

which says we hold an offense constitutes burglary for

5

purposes of 924(e) if either the statutory definition

6

corresponds to generic burglary, which it doesn't here, or

7

the charging paper, which it doesn't here, and jury

8

instructions, which the judge tells the jury you must find

9

this in order to convict.

Those are not for examples.

10

That paragraph says you've got three things you can look

11

to.

12

look to the charging paper, and you can look to the jury

13

instruction.

14

You can look to the statutory definition.

You can

And that's it.

MR. ELWOOD:

I think, though, that in the

15

context that -- that is, if you're going to include guilty

16

pleas at all for these sort of straddle offenses that -­

17

that some of the conduct is generic burglary and some

18

isn't, that if Taylor is accepted on face value, where it

19

isn't an example, then it -- it basically would mean that,

20

sub silentio, the -- the Court had held that guilty pleas

21

could not be used at all for this sort of inquiry under

22

the Armed Career Criminal Act, which I think would be

23

extraordinarily or -- or it would definitely limit at

24

least the utility of the ACCA as an act punishing

25

recidivism because the vast majority of convictions are

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, whenever straddle crimes,

but -- but they're the exception rather than the rule.
MR. ELWOOD:

That is probably the case.

I know

that there are something like 28 States that have them.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But even burglary I think in

most States would be clear.
MR. ELWOOD:

There -- there are many States that

15

-- that have offenses that include both generic and

16

nongeneric burglary, although I think that it's probably

17

true that most -- most burglary statutes are either

18

generic or nongeneric, not sort of straddled like that.

19

But in any event, I think it would significantly limit the

20

utility of the ACCA.

21

And in addition, every court of appeals with

22

criminal jurisdiction has held that that's not what it

23

means, that it does mean, as Justice Breyer indicated,

24

that that was one example that the Court meant.

25

after all, a fairly abbreviated discussion that wasn't

It is,

Alderson Reporting Company

briefed by the parties in the case, and I don't think that

the Court should read it so expansively based on

3

relatively ambiguous language.

If there are no further questions from the

Court, we'll rely on our submission.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA J. THOMPSON

9

Thank you, Mr. Elwood.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. THOMPSON:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

11

First, I would like to point out that the Armed

12

Career Criminal Act does not punish all recidivism.

13

designed to punish the people who have prior convictions

14

for those offenses falling -- falling within the

15

categories.

16

recidivism.

17

So it's not designed to punish all

Massachusetts does have generic burglary

18

statutes.

19

among them.

20

as home invasion, Massachusetts punishes those under

21

generic burglary statutes.

22

It is

These statutes that are at issue here are not
But for the serious forms of burglary, such

So those do exist.

With regard to the record that the Court can

23

look at in making this determination, it was significant

24

in the district court that Judge Gertner was not pointed

25

to the face of the complaint.

And as you look at the

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

complaints that are shown in the third appendix in this

2

case, there is -- there are dates listed at the bottom.

3

The entries in those docket sheets were made at different

4

times, not all made at the time of a guilty plea.

5

Government did not present any evidence to help the court

6

understand anything about the way the dockets were made

7

and the entries were made when a guilty plea was taken in

8

the district court.

9

The

The third thing of interest is, as Judge Gertner

10

found, there was no reason for a contemporaneous contest

11

of the evidence -- of the material in the police report

12

because the police report was not part of the plea

13

proceeding.

14
