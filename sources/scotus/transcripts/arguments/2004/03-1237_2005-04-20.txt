ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Your -- Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Your Honors, there is no dispute among the

11

parties, nor among the 19 amicus briefs presented before

12

the Court today.

13

question, everyone agrees that the FDA exemption does,

14

indeed, apply, with full force, to the sorts of

15

experiments that are conducted and that would be relevant

16

to the FDA in consideration of an Investigational New Drug

17

application, a so-called IND.

18

shifts to Integra's alternative arguments in support of

19

the judgment -

20

As to the answer to the threshold legal

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So the battleground now

Well, would you just clarify

21

something for me as we start to consider the case?

22

guess this thing went to the jury under an instruction

23

that tried to come to grips with the definition under the

24

statute in some way.

25

Merck preserved an objection?

I

Was that instruction one to which

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

We did not

2

object to the core of the jury's instructions stating the

3

legal standard.

And we -

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

5

stated in that instruction?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

13

The core of the instruction,

yes, Your Honor, was -

Do you think it was properly

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That's as good as we could

do.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I believe -- the

answer is, the core was as good as this Court can do, and
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

All right.

you think that Merck was entitled to a directed verdict -

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

17

a matter of law, but let me just -

18

And, under that,

Yes, Your Honor.
-- from the evidence?
It was entitled to a verdict as

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Okay, but the Court of

19

Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case

20

in -- by looking at the evidence and whether a directed

21

verdict should have been given -

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

25

Your Honor, the -- or not?
-- the Federal Circuit did

understand that this was a JMOL case -

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I know, but it seemed to decide

2

the case based on its view of the statute as just applying

3

to generic drugs or something like that.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That is absolutely correct,

Your Honor.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So it didn't, in fact, come

It absolutely did not come to

grips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the
alternative arguments that Integra was presenting -

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, so -

-- so they -- maybe all we have to do is

14

deal with whether that court should have addressed the

15

evidence.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That would be one answer, Your

17

Honor, reverse and not addressing the alternative legal

18

grounds, but I would urge this Court to address the

19

alternative grounds, because they raise -

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

the research tools problem?

22
23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

All of them?

You mean, like

No, Your Honor, because the

research tools problem was never presented -

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No.

or before the District Court.

And Or the Tripps Treaty?

No, Your Honor.
No.
In fact, that's not even raised

It's raised by amici's -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

All right.

And how about the

common-law research example MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I would -- I would urge the

10

Court not broach the subject of any of the questions that

11

are not properly presented -

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

-- to this Court.
-- all we're doing is looking

at the statute.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

19

Okay, so -

We're -Thank you.
Yes, Your Honor, we're looking

at the statute -

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.
-- but it is an -- it is

22

important, in answer to the very first question, to

23

embellish a bit, because the lower courts need this

24

Court's guidance, because every one of the theories on

25

which Integra defends the judgment below raise exactly

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same problems that the Federal Circuit's opinion

2

raises.

Congress passed.

4

purpose that Congress had in mind when it passed the FDA

5

exemption.

They defy the plain language of the statute
They are equally at odds with the

6

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What are the

7

alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on

8

by the Federal Circuit?

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, they were not

10

passed on by the Federal Circuit, except perhaps to the

11

extent that the Federal Circuit may have concluded that

12

all -- or that, excuse me -- that safety is the only issue

13

before the FDA when it is considering an Investigational

14

New Drug application, or that a drug innovator may not

15

harbor additional purposes in an experiment beyond the FDA

16

exemption, or that the -- excuse me -- beyond FDA

17

regulatory purposes -- or, third, that the exemption does

18

not cover efforts to optimize the drug candidate after

19

it's identified and that drug candidate is, in fact, the

20

lead candidate.

21

Those are the three legal theories, Your Honors,

22

on which Integra is resting its defense of the judgment

23

below.

24

as a matter of law or immaterial as a matter of law.

25

this Court were to ask Integra to come up with a single

And every single one of them is either incorrect

genuine issue of fact that does not relate to one or

2

another of those three propositions, it will not be able

3

to do so, save a footnote to be addressed later about the

4

credibility of witnesses on a topic on which Integra never

5

argued the witnesses were not credible.

6

Just beginning with the safety question, and

7

I'll defer to the Government on that, because the

8

Government can speak better than anyone else as to what it

9

is that is relevant to the FDA in consideration of an IND,

10

suffice it to say that the regulations say, as a matter of

11

law, that safety is not the only consideration before the

12

FDA as it considers an IND.

13

whether a drug will work: efficacy.

14

much about how it works: mechanism of action.

15

about what the body does to that drug: pharmacokinetics.

16

And it cares very much about what that drug does to the

17

body: pharmacology.

18

jury, and before this Court, depends upon the proposition

19

that it can bring in a witness to argue that the law is

20

other than what the law clearly is.

21

goes for the so-called GLP studies that the FDA considers

22

in connection with safety data, but need not limit itself

23

to GLP studies when it's considering those other IND-

24

relevant topics.

25

The FDA cares very much about
The FDA cares very
It cares

And Integra's position before the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the same thing

Mr. Rosenkranz, just one

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

piece of information.

2

this point, is it in the record -- do we have a copy of

3

the IND?

4

Because the IND is so important at

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The IND, Your Honor, is not in

5

the record, because it was excluded from evidence, which

6

may be why the jury reached the wrong conclusion.

7

hasten to add, that will not be uncommon in these sorts of

8

cases, because there are many circumstances in which a

9

preclinical study begins and fails, and the IND will never

10

materialize.

11

preliminary injunction is brought and won, and the

12

research stops cold, so an IND never materializes.

13

But, I

There are circumstances in which a

And, again, it's important to understand, as one

14

assesses the FDA exemption, that the inquiry is always ex

15

ante, it is always, "What is a reasonable drug innovator?

16

What does that drug innovator or scientist know at the

17

point in time at which it is about to perform the next set

18

of experiments?"

19

time before the IND materializes.

20

So you always reflect back to a point in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Rosenkranz, the items you

21

listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I

22

took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that

23

the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit

24

simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared

25

for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the -- for the drug application, later on.

2

abandoning that more expansive position?

Are you

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because I don't read the

5

opinion that way.

6

read to say that they're not going to allow in anything

7

that goes to the IND.

8
9

I don't think that opinion has to be

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, there is certainly

a way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion -- and this is

10

also in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question -

11

in which it did grapple with the very questions we're

12

talking about now, and did answer the questions about

13

whether it's just safety -- and I believe the Federal

14

Circuit believed that only safety data were relevant; that

15

is certainly what it indicated in oral argument -- and

16

also that dual purposes are not permissible.

17
18
19

So let me now turn to the dual-purpose question,
because it's another major theme of JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have you answered my question?

20

You're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit

21

did not consider anything that didn't go to the IND -

22

that didn't go to the -

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The -

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- drug application.

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe that

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there are two ways to read the Federal Circuit's opinion.

2

To the extent that the Federal Circuit said nothing before

3

the clinical stage is relevant to the FDA exemption -- if

4

that is what the Federal Circuit held, we are -- we are

5

not abandoning the position that that is wrong.

6

understand that there is another way to read the Federal

7

Circuit's opinion that grapples with the subsidiary

8

questions that we're discussing here, which are all fairly

9

presented in our question presented.

10
11

I

And that's what I'm

addressing myself to now.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

For your first answer, are you

12

relying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion -

13

and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix -- that is,

14

the Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented,

15

whether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps-

16

Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement

17

of Integra's patents.

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

And then, two

19

pages later, on 12a, the Federal Circuit states its

20

conclusion, and I quote, "Thus, the Scripps work sponsored

21

by Merck was not solely for use as reasonably related to

22

clinical testing for the FDA."

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it -- it's not at all

24

clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical

25

and clinical in the very technical sense that you were -

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you use it, which means "clinical" is stuff submitted

2

for the drug application, and "preclinical" is for the

3

earlier application.

4

That is not at all -

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it's not at all

5

clear.

6

situation where it wasn't clear what the Federal -- or,

7

excuse me -- what the Court of Appeals held, the Court --,

8

"The best thing for this Court to do is to address what

9

appears to be the threshold question that the Court of

And, just as in Boyle, when this Court faced a

10

Appeals decided," but then also to address the subsidiary

11

questions on the basis of which Integra is defending the

12

judgment below.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, Mr. Rosenkranz A moment ago -- a

15

moment ago, you were reading from 12(a).

16

sentence you were reading from?

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Was it the first

It was the first

18

paragraph, and I was reading from the end of that

19

paragraph, Your Honor, the -- which begins, "Thus," three

20

lines -- really two -- the word "thus" is at the end of

21

the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, Your

22

Honor.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

25

Thank you.

And so, I was saying earlier

that a critical component of Integra's case revolves

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

around the notion that the use may not have more than one

2

purpose, and that purpose can only be FDA directed.

3

argument is also incorrect as a matter of law.

4

way we can tell that is that there is no such thing as a

5

preclinical course of study that has only one purpose.

6

When one is studying mechanism of action, a scientist is

7

deeply interested, not just in how this drug works, but in

8

how the disease works.

9

is, of course, the touchstone here.

And one

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If that -

Would that -- would that -

15

would that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or

16

not?

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, absolutely not, Your Honor.

18

The research-tool question -- let me begin by saying,

19

these were not research tools; these RGD peptides were the

20

objects of study.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I guess what I was asking,

22

Would you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my

23

-- was my question.

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

There are

circumstances in which these peptides could be used as

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

research tools to stunt the growth of blood vessels and

2

study what happens next with other compounds, but they

3

were emphatically not used as research tools in this case.

4

In this case, they were the objects of study, and Integra

5

won a jury verdict based upon that presentation.

6

fact, never argued to any court or to the jury that there

7

is a resource tool carve out. So, I was just talking about

8

the subjective purpose earlier, and it is -- again, it's

9

important to note that the information can be used for

10

other purposes.

11

prohibits that.

12

And, in

There's nothing in the statute that

Now, let me turn, just briefly then, to what is

13

often one of the most important questions in these FDA

14

exemption cases, which is the timeline question.

15

point in the arc of drug development is it unreasonable

16

for a jury to conclude that the FDA is an inappropriate

17

audience for the next set of experiments?

18

and people may differ, as a matter of law, as to whether

19

it is earlier -- but our argument is, at a bare minimum, at

20

the point in time at which a drug developer has a known

21

structure and cures a disease in an animal with that known

22

structure, all eyes turn to drug development; which is to

23

say, all eyes turn to the FDA.

24

everything after that, so long as it's relevant to the

25

FDA, is FDA -- is appropriate to view as FDA directed.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you agree then that at

2

whatever period, however you want to describe the period,

3

at which the researcher is basically trying to figure out

4

what drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far

5

back in time to come within the exception?

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

That's exactly

7

the trigger moment.

8

investigating analogs of that structure to figure out

9

which of these various structures are the best ones to

If it has a structure, and it's

10

move forward, everything from that point on is FDA

11

directed.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

problem I have with your argument.

14

argument more easily under the statute, under the text of

15

the statute as it is written, than I can understand it

16

under the instruction that you agreed to, because the

17

instruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual

18

limitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers

19

to "relatively directly" as describing the relationship

20

between this information and its object.

21

this case on the basis of the statute, and we read the

22

statute more broadly than the instruction, then you're

23

getting something that you're not entitled to, because you

24

agreed to the instruction.

25

construing the statute as if your instruction is correct,

then we're making an assumption about the proper

2

construction of the statute that has not been argued here.

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It seems to me that the law of

5

the case, as to what the statute means for your case, is

6

set by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to

7

get into the issue that you raise here, because I think

8

we're rather -- you are limited, and we are tied in what

9

we can do as a result of your agreement with the

10
11

instruction.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor -- and I see my time

12

is running out; I'd like to reserve a bit for rebuttal, so

13

let me answer, just briefly.

14

this Court is not bound by law of the case by the

15

instruction.

16

exactly what the statute says.

17

simply another way of saying, "Are these activities

18

reasonably related to the FDA purposes?"

19

the comparative experiments is relevant to the FDA's inquiry,

20

whether this drug or that is the optimum drug.

percent that were comparative in nature -- develops

information about the lead drug candidate, including

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

6

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I believe the question before the Court is the

11

proper construction of the statute, and we believe the

12

lower courts committed three important legal errors that

13

should be corrected.

14

The first is in drawing the clinical/preclinical

15

distinction.

16

think the important thing to understand is that clinical

17

studies refer to studies conducted on humans, and at the

18

IND stage, the whole question is to decide whether studies

19

should be conducted on humans.

20

essentially saying, you cannot do the information that's

necessary to submit an IND, necessary to do clinical

trials, necessary to get your drug approved.

why we -- it seems to us that that's clearly wrong.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Do you have to have

the FDA's permission to start clinical testing?
MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes, that's the purpose of an IND

5

application, is -- the whole -- the only thing that FDA is

6

looking at, at that point, is whether to permit human

7

clinical trials to proceed.

8
9

The second important legal error committed by
the Federal Circuit was in apparently concluding that only

10

tests regarding the compounds ultimately submitted to FDA

11

in an IND are subject to the protection.

12

with that is that a company can decide which specific

13

compound to submit only by first comparing -- doing

14

studies on that compound and on others in order to

15

determine which would be the best compound to submit,

16

which would strike the best balance between obtaining

health effects or avoiding safety concerns.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, if the

Would you state again what

you say the second error was?
MR. JOSEFFER:

The second error, we believe, is

22

that the Federal Circuit indicated that only studies

23

undertaken on the single compound ultimately submitted in

24

an IND are protected by the exception.

25

with that is that I can't figure out what that one

MR. JOSEFFER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- which is the best to submit.
But that might well determine

6

whether the research was relatively directly related.

relatively directly related if it relates to that

particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I understand all that.

But -

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the -- I'm just saying that that is

22

certainly one interpretation of "reasonably directly."

23

And if that is so, then you are erroneous in your

24

assumption that the question before this Court is the

25

meaning of the statute.

It might not be.

It might be -

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

it might be the meaning of the instruction.

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, I think we would disagree

3

with that, for two reasons.

4

Circuit, as Justice O'Connor noted, reserved -- resolved

5

these questions entirely as a matter of law, based on a de

6

novo interpretation of the statute, without regard to the

7

jury instruction.

8

before this Court.

9
10

And that's the holding that's now

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
jury instruction?

11

The first is that the Federal

What's your position on the

Does it correctly state the law?

MR. JOSEFFER:

We think that it's -- if it's

12

construed correctly, we think that it's correct, but just

13

too general to be of assistance to the courts in

14

addressing the more specific questions of the issue here.

15

And this is -- remember, Merck has sought judgment as a

16

matter of law.

17

matter of law, the courts are not constrained to only

18

applying the law that's found in the jury instruction;

19

they can also articulate and apply -- and do all the time

20

-- other legal principles that are relevant.

21

v. St. Louis is a great example of a case where this Court

22

did that.

23

And when a party seeks judgment as a

Now, there would be a problem if the jury

instruction was inconsistent with the correct rule of law,

because then there could be a waiver concern.

But we

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

don't see that at issue here, because the jury

instruction, we think, was just too general to speak to

these issues.

But getting back to my point about why it can't
be limited to that single compound CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But who's fault is that

7

that the jury instruction is too general.

8

parties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?

MR. JOSEFFER:

I mean, if both

10

should not, and is not, arguing inconsistently with the

11

jury instruction.

12

lay people, tend to be instructed -

13

15

The point is just that juries, being

The Petitioner said he

agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.
MR. JOSEFFER:

I think that's just with the

16

general principles.

17

Jurors are instructed all the time that the Defendant has

18

a duty of ordinary care.

19

determine more specific legal questions, whether entire

20

classes of conduct do or do not comply with the ordinary

21

care, in much greater detailed instructions to the jury.

22

And example of a case where this Court did that would be

23

Shenker v. B&O Railroad, at 374 U.S. 1.

articulate and apply the specific legal principles here;

2

they're not inconsistent with the jury -

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Was the court below wrong in

4

saying that the statute was enacted only to help generic-

5

drug development?

6

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

In fact, this Court already

7

held in Eli Lilly v. Medtronic that the statute is not

8

limited to generic drugs.

9

to drugs, but also applies to things like medical devices,

In fact, it's not even limited

10

food additives, color additives.

11

important point, because the Federal Circuit thought the

12

statute to be construed in an artificially narrow manner

13

in light of a supposed focus on generic drugs, which is

14

just inconsistent with this Court's authoritative

15

construction of the statute.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it's a very

Is that going to be your third

17

point, the third error that the court supposedly

18

committed?

19

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, the third is the error

20

committed by the District Court and relied on by

21

Respondents here, which is the statement that FDA only

22

considers safety, and not efficacy, in determining whether

23

to permit human clinical trials to proceed.

24

important point, because at the IND stage the question for

25

FDA is whether a drug should be given to human beings.

It's a very

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And because there's no such thing as an absolutely safe

2

drug, because all drugs entail at least some safety risks,

3

FDA will not let human clinical trials proceed unless

4

there's some reason to believe that the study could be

5

useful.

6

Court looks to whether the potential benefits of the test

7

would outweigh the risks of the test; and if not, the

8

Court will not let a test proceed.

9

It's a -- it's a benefit-risk analysis.

The

Now, Congress charged FDA with doing that by

10

instructing FDA to determine whether the drug would pose

11

an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of humans.

12

And FDA has construed that, as I said, to mean the

13

benefit-risk.

14

The most express articulation of that comes in

15

the guidance document that FDA has put out regarding the

16

preparation of the investigators brochure, which is a

17

required part of the 9d submission.

18

-- and the guidance document explains that the

19

investigators brochure must provide sufficient information

20

for the -- for the reader to, quote, "make his/her own

21

unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the proposed

22

guess is there are criminal consequences for doing that,

too.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And my

Your time is short, so could

7

you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you

8

can go and not -- and be within the safe harbor?

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

We think that the proper

10

test looks to whether a company is trying to develop a

11

particular drug, by which we mean a substance with

12

particular characteristics designed to achieve particular

13

objectives.

processes is not protected.

17

for a drug, this says I'm going to treat the disease in a

particular way by targeting a particular part of the

19

disease process.

21

figure out which would be the best active ingredient, is

22

protected.

23

To explain that, we recognize that basic

That's just too far down the

But once I get a particular concept

Then we think that the work done, going

To provide a concrete example -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't that basic research?

24

I mean, I want to -- I want to treat this disease by

25

stifling the development of blood cells around it, or

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

something like that, and then you ask yourself, "Gee, what

2

would stifle the production of blood cells?"

3

assume there hasn't been any research done in that field

4

before.

5

long as the idea I have in my -- in my head is, I want to

6

create a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood

7

cells?

8
9

And let's

You wouldn't consider that basic research, so

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

And here's why.

The basic

insight, and then I'll explain it, is that the first time

10

a study -- a study is run on a particular substance, if

11

that's -- first study is not protected, then the exemption

12

is worthless, because I'd have to commit that infringing

13

study before I gained the protection of the exemption.

14

So, we would say that the -- in this case, for

15

example -- I think it's easier on particulars -- the

16

basic research was figuring out that the key to cancer is

17

-- the key to the growth of tumors is angiogenesis, and

18

the key to blocking angiogenesis is blocking the alpha v

19

beta 3 receptors.

20

body works.

21

which substance would best block an alpha v beta 3

22

receptor, it's very specific, because I know what that

23

receptor is, I know what it's like, I know what

24

characteristics I'm going to need in a drug to block that.

25

And when I try different things out to block that, that

because, otherwise, I'd have to commit the infringement

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How does the common law

research exemption figure into this case, if at all?
MR. JOSEFFER:

It's not directly before here

12

because Petitioner has not relied on it at all, and

13

for good reason, which is that the courts have

14

consistently held that the common law research exception

applies only to noncommercial activity.

This Court stated, in Black versus Cutter

Laboratories, which is cited on page 27 of our brief, as

13

follows, "At times, the atmosphere in which an opinion is

written may become so surcharged that unnecessarily broad

statements are made.

opinion is set forth in page 14a in the appendix attached

for judgment as a matter of law because the Federal Circuit

of the safe harbor do not embrace the Scripps-Merck

Exactly.

And so, they are

17

saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking

that the language and context don't embrace it.

The only interpretation of the

denying Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law is

9

the standard articulated in the jury instruction.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but I think -- I think the

11

Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals

12

that -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- applied a particular

16

Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what

17

constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed

18

to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the -- by

19

the safe harbor exemption?

20

could you -- how could you rule on the question before you

21

unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe

22

harbor consists of and what is beyond it?

23

And certainly it had to have been.

MR. FLORES:

It must have had.

Didn't the

I mean, how

The question before the Federal

24

Circuit was whether the District Court erred by not

25

applying the rational predicate interpretation of section

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

271(e), which was the sole focus of Merck's appeal to the

2

Federal Circuit.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should we say that's the

4

question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I

5

read before from 10a?

6

MR. FLORES:

Your Honor, on page 10a, the Federal

7

Circuit said, "Thus" -- and this is in the -- the last

8

sentence in the middle paragraph of the page -- "Thus,

9

this Court must determine whether section -- the section

10

271(e) safe harbor reaches back down the chain of

11

experimentation to embrace development and identification

12

of new drugs that will, in turn, be subject to FDA

13

approval."

14

JUSTICE BREYER: That would answer that question?

15

MR. FLORES:

16

answered that in the negative.

17

rejected the interpretation advanced by Merck, which was

18

the rational predicate standard, which was basically a

19

causal test, and held that the District Court's

20

interpretation, under the Intermedics standard that's

21

given in the jury instruction, that Merck now concedes is

22

the correct standard.

23

It does not.

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back

it -- I left out the word "identification" -- as I read

incorrect statement?

MR. FLORES:

That is a correct statement of the

law.

8
9

In your opinion, is that statement, as I read

JUSTICE BREYER:
the law.

That is a correct statement of

So then, I take it, the other thinks that it

10

isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation

11

where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs,

12

you do some experiments and you get some information that

13

would be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and,

14

therefore, they are within the safe harbor.

15

MR. FLORES:

No, Your Honor.

I believe the

16

Solicitor General agrees with this aspect of the Federal

17

Circuit's opinion and makes that clear at the bottom of

18

page 15 and onto page 16 of the Solicitor General's brief.

19

Merck no longer challenges this aspect of the Federal

Circuit's opinion.

they're necessary in the chain of causation, are not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Flores, when I asked you

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one

2

that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and

3

that is, "The questioning arising in this case is whether

4

the preclinical research" -- that is, the research on

5

animals, as distinguished from humans -- "conducted under

6

the Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for

7

infringement of Integra's patents."

8
9

Now, if you just took that as the question, then you
would say it -- this Circuit is drawing the line between

10

clinical and preclinical.

11

opinion, by any means, but that is one question presented

12

that they've identified.

13

question?

14

MR. FLORES:

It's not a crystal-clear

And how do they answer that

Your Honor, I disagree.

I think

15

the operative language in this sentence is the reference

16

to "the Scripps-Merck" -- is to "research conducted under

17

the Scripps-Merck agreement."

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the way I read it.

It

19

-- the -- and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel

20

from the other side.

21

conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between

22

clinical and preclinical.

23

sentence is -- the question, they say, is not whether

24

preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether

25

the "preclinical research conducted under the Scripps

what that means.

3

information for submission to the United States Food and

4

Drug Administration, but, instead, identified the best

5

drug candidate.

6

And then the next sentence explains
The experiments did not supply

So, I think what they're describing as the

7

question presented is whether preclinical research that is

8

-- that is not directed to supplying information for

9

submission to the Food and Drug Administration, but,

10

instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that

11

type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.

12

MR. FLORES:

Yes.

In fact, Justice Scalia, if

13

this opinion by the Federal Circuit were interpreted to

14

hold that preclinical experiments are categorically

15

excluded from the scope of the exemption, that holding

16

would be inconsistent with the District Court's

17

interpretation of the law, because the District Court's

18

interpretation of the law was that preclinical experiments

19

are potentially eligible, and the District Court submitted

20

the question to the jury.

21

So the Federal Circuit would be completely

22

inconsistent, if, on the one hand, it categorically

23

excluded preclinical experiments, and, on the other hand,

24

it approved the District Court's reasoning.

back, and then you can make all your arguments there about

15

how it applies.

16

MR. FLORES:

Yes.

So, what's

The reason it would not be

17

appropriate for the Court to do so is because no standard,

18

other than the Intermedics standard that was applied by

19

the District Court, was ever suggested to the District

21

There was only one standard ever considered.

MR. FLORES:

Yes, Your Honor.

But in this case

3

the issue before the District Court was whether the

4

District Court erred in denying a motion for judgment as

5

a matter of law.

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, don't you think that

7

the Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic

8

drug applications?

9

Do you think it was right about that?

MR. FLORES:

I think the Federal Circuit was

10

right, as a factual matter, in describing the impetus for

11

Congress adopting section 271(e).

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it seemed to be driven

13

by its very narrow focus on generic drug development.

14

you -- do you think that the efficacy of the drug being

15

suggested plays a role in the IND application?

16

MR. FLORES:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

No, Your Honor, it does not.
See, I think there may be a

18

difference there, because I think the other side thinks

19

that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and

20

whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is

21

part of what the FDA looks at.

22

takes that position, as narrowly as I could determine.

23

But you reject that, as well.

24
25

MR. FLORES:

Do

Apparently, the Government

answer to that is in the statute.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is this text that you're

referring to, is it someplace -- is the text someplace

14

where we can look at it while you're explaining this to

us?

16

MR. FLORES:

No, Your Honor, it's not in the

18

because it's instructive about what Congress told FDA to

19

weigh for the -

20

Let me read that statute,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But does the -- does the

21

statute -- is that the only place we would look to decide

22

whether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?

23

MR. FLORES:

No, Your Honor.

believe, address that.

that the Government does not agree with you on this point?

It says -

MR. FLORES:

Right.
What are you reading from?

Page 3a in the addendum to

Integra's brief.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. FLORES:

Okay.

That's 21 C.F.R. Section 312.22(a).

14

It states that, "The FDA's primary objectives in reviewing

15

an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure

16

the safety and rights of subjects, and, in phase two and

17

three, to help assure that the quality of the scientific

18

investigation of the drugs is adequate to permit an

19

evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety."

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, that talks about the

21

primary concern.

22

with efficacy to this extent.

23

know, before they allow clinical trials, whether the drug

24

that it is proposed to give cancer patients has some

25

relationship to cancer, as opposed to the common cold.

There is certainly going to be concern
They are going to want to

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

Admittedly, at the clinical trial they're trying to find

2

out how effective it is on human beings, but there's got

3

to be some threshold showing of effectiveness.

4

simply ignore effectiveness and look at safety entirely

5

prior to that point.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In fact, that paragraph refers

7

to effectiveness, as I read it.

8

MR. FLORES:

9

They can't

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

But it

does -- it refers to it in the context of phases two and

10

three.

11

trials in humans, there's no way tell whether this drug is

12

going to be effective.

13

And the simple fact is that until there's clinical

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But there is at least -

14

there's got to be some way to tell whether it even

15

addresses the disease.

16

effectiveness question.

17

MR. FLORES:

That is essentially a threshold

The FDA statutes and regulations do

18

not use the term "efficacy" to describe that.

19

355(i)(3)(B)(i), when Congress listed the factors to

20

consider, what it listed was not efficacy.

21

not to be found where its listed -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In section

Efficacy is

Congress described the need

23

that there be some relationship between the consequences

24

of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed

25

to be addressed by taking the drug.

If they didn't use

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the word "efficacy," what word did they use?

2

MR. FLORES:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

They They used the word

"effectiveness," which is pretty close.

5

[Laughter.]

6

MR. FLORES:

No, Your Honor, they used the word,

7

in the statute, "the condition for which the drug is to be

8

investigated."

9

JUSTICE BREYER: That's important. They say they

10

want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in

11

relation to its proposed therapeutic indication.

12

reason, I take it, the word "efficacy" is not there

13

directly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver

14

hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do

15

anything.

16

when you consider whether something is safe, you must

17

know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the

18

extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its

19

effect in curing people.

20

particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this

21

is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how

22

effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that

23

are -- that are harmful?

24

answer to that question at all, I might be tempted to

25

agree with you, because it doesn't use the word.

Safety is a different matter.

1

what's the answer?

2

MR. FLORES:

The answer is that the FDA

3

considers what information is available to it.

4

not have information about the effectiveness of the drug,

5

because clinical trials have not taken place; and,

6

therefore, the regulations and the statutes say you do the

-- what you can.

8

9

It does

You look at the condition for which the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why wouldn't it have

10

information about effectiveness on animals?

11

the -- you show that the -- all the FDA's interested in is

12

that it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was

13

effective to cure the tumor?

MR. FLORES:

I mean, if

The FDA is concerned with safety in

17

heightened look at potential benefits in order to balance

18

that out.

this particular case -

20

And there may be some cases in which there is a

But the regulations focus on safety.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And in

Yes, but it's absolutely

21

clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in

22

some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not

23

only safety, but how effective it is.

24

the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great,

25

I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.

And sometimes if

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

So, I would think that you would want to encourage the

2

exemption to cover those matters.

3

MR. FLORES:

Your Honor, of course FDA is very

4

concerned about efficacy, and it -- but concerned about

5

that after it gets data from human clinical trials.

6

That's the -- that is the basis of -

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I'm not sure.

If there's

8

data earlier, at the IND stage, as a result of the lab tests

9

and the animal tests, I would think that would be part of

10
11

the exemption.
MR. FLORES:

If efficacy -- or some information

12

about what benefits the drug might have, is probably a

13

better way to phrase it -- is considered at the safety

14

stage as part of the safety balancing, then it's got to be

15

done under good laboratory practices, because -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose that we concluded -

17

well, I don't want to cut you off.

18

cut you off.

19

MR. FLORES:

Yes.

Go ahead, please.

If I

If -- I believe the Solicitor

20

General's point is that the safety decision is a practical

21

one, and you've got to look at both sides of the ledger -

22

potential harm, potential benefit -- I don't believe it's

23

proper to call that "efficacy."

24

if it's part of the safety balancing it has to be done

25

under good laboratory procedures.

But whatever you call it,

That, I think, is clear

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

from the FDA regulations.

wouldn't make any sense for the FDA to say that half of

the safety equation need not be done under good laboratory

practices.

done under that.

Both parts of the safety equation have to be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- so what?

I don't

understand what conclusion that leads to.

8
9

And, as a matter of policy, it

MR. FLORES:

Well, Justice Scalia, let me say

that I think that this whole discussion about the

10

interpretation of the FDA law is really somewhat off the

11

point here.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was beginning to think that,

too.

14

[Laughter.]

15

MR. FLORES:

And the reason I say that is

16

because we're not here to judge the legality of an FDA

17

action in its discretion, saying we want to consider

18

preclinical -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but the reason you

20

brought it up is because the particular certificate that

21

is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab

22

that used this stuff.

23

think.

That's why you brought it up, I

24

MR. FLORES:

does include the safety part, looking at how effective

5

drugs are, too.

6

meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary

laboratory that didn't have the special certificate?

8

Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in

advance of the clinical test period to get the information

Suppose I concluded that the statute

10

for the IND?

11

where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look

12

at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do.

13

If I concluded that -- and I'm not saying I would -- then

14

would you concede that a directed verdict would have been

15

appropriate against you?

And suppose I concluded that sometimes,

MR. FLORES:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18
19

No, Your Honor.
Because?

And what's your

strongest argument that it wouldn't?
MR. FLORES:

Well, Your Honor, there's numerous

20

admissions in the record that Merck made which would

21

indicate that they've -- that the program carried out at

22

Scripps was not reasonably related to the FDA, that the

23

real FDA work was being done in Germany, that the majority

24

of these experiments conducted by Scripps were conducted

25

on chicken embryos, which Merck's own scientists agree
