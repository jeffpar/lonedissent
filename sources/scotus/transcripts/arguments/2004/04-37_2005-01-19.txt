ORAL ARGUMENT OF WELLON B. POE, JR.

We'll now hear argument in

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. POE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
This case today involves a conflict between

12

Oklahoma's semi-closed primary law and a rule adopted by

13

the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma which, contrary to that

14

State law, would allow the Libertarian Party to open its

15

primary elections not just to independent voters, but also

16

voters registered as members of other political parties.

17

The Oklahoma primary system simply requires that

18

a person who is registered as a member of that party may

19

only vote in that political party's primaries.

20

voter desires to vote in another party's primary, all that

21

voter must do is, within a reasonable time before the

22

elections, primary elections, approximately 7 to 8 weeks,

23

is disaffiliate from that first party and then reaffiliate

24

as a member of that second party, or if the parties so

25

chose to allow independents, he may registered as an

independent in order to vote in that primary.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, of course, I guess from

3

the standpoint of the Libertarian Party, it's kind of a

4

problem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under

5

Oklahoma law with their -- their prior registration have

6

to do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't

7

know if the Libertarian Party will even qualify for having

8

a primary.

9

short window.

10
11

I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly
If the time were reasonable, that might be

a different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?
MR. POE:

Well, Your Honor, the practicality of

12

that matter is -- is that generally the parties are

13

notified 10 days/2 weeks in advance of the registration

14

deadline that they are being -- if -- being recognized as

15

a political party.

16

has waited until the very last minute by statute in which

17

to turn in their petitions and try to get recognized.

18

course, those petitions could be turned in earlier, which

19

would allow them more time to do so.

20

of the -- of --

21
22
23

Of course -- and that's if that party

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of

But the practicality

If they're turned in earlier,

will they -- will they be ruled on earlier?
MR. POE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Oklahoma statute

24

requires that the election board take a -- has 30 days, a

25

maximum of 30 days, in which to review the petitions,

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

verify the number of signatures and the authenticity of

2

those signatures, and then make a decision on whether to

3

recognize or not recognize the political party.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess there's a difference

5

here between the interest of a small party and a large

6

one.

7

be as close to the election as possible so voters have a

8

chance to get fed up with the two big parties.

9
10

A small party would like, if there is a deadline, to

(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's their chance.

A big

11

party would like it to be further away because then they

12

can plan how their election campaign is going to be.

13

Has any of this been litigated below?

14

MR. POE:

No, Your Honor.

The -- the only

15

question that has really been litigated below is whether

16

section 1-104, which is the semi-closed primary law, is

17

burdensome on the association rights of the Libertarians.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In line -- in line with

19

Justice Breyer's question, does the State of Oklahoma have

20

an interest in insulating major parties from competition

21

for members?

22

MR. POE:

Not from insulating them from

23

competition, Your Honor, but the State of Oklahoma does

24

have -- it has a closed primary system.

25

an interest.

It has -- it has

And this Court has found that interest, as

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

recently as in Timmons, that it does have an interest in a

2

stable political system, which may be a two-party system.

3

As long as --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you have a -- the State has

5

an interest in protecting major parties from losing their

6

members and thereby weakening the two-party system by

7

benefiting a third party.

8

the whole thrust of our holding in cases such as Anderson

9

and Celebreeze where third parties are entitled to special

10
11

I thought that's contrary to

protection under the First Amendment.
MR. POE:

Well, Your Honor, since that time in

12

Anderson and as Timmons and other cases cite, if the

13

regulation is a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation,

14

then it is a proper regulation as far as it is applied to

15

all the parties.

16

In regards to the requirement of registration,

17

change of voter registration, all of those are applied

18

equally across any -- any party, whether it be the

19

Libertarian Party, the Democratic Party, Republican Party,

20

or any other party which may be recognized at that time in

21

the State of Oklahoma.

22

And back to Justice Breyer's comments, the

23

period of 7 to 8 weeks prior to a voting -- to a primary

24

election is actually a very short time as compared, for

25

example, to Rosario which this Court --

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, even in presidential

2

elections, most people don't get interested until 4 or 5

3

weeks before the election.

4

MR. POE:

Everybody knows that.

Well, Your Honor, we -- this is not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

last couple weeks.

10

MR. POE:

Well, I'm saying even in a

If they're local races, it -- it

The public just tunes out until the last --

Well, the statutes in this -- or the

11

sites or the -- the elections themselves are close in

12

time, and -- and the statutes involving the petitioning

13

have all been looked at as -- as courts and have been

14

found that this is a close enough connection to the time

15

of the elections, that that time frame of petitioning and

16

getting the requirements for -- for petitions and the

17

State recognizing the political party all fit comfortably

18

within the confines of -- of constitutionality.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Poe, the -- the district

20

court in this case rejected all grounds except one.

21

rejected the raiding and swamping.

22

the Libertarians want to expose themselves to.

23

for a State to be paternalistic to protect them against

24

their own bad choices.

25

damaging to the majority parties, to the major parties,

It

It said that's what
It's not

But it said this request is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

because it poaches on their members.

2

this litigation any major party that's complaining about

3

that.

4

went on, can this Court possibly uphold it when there is

5

nobody, as far as we know -- they haven't even come into

6

this case at this level, filing a friend of the Court

7

brief.

8

But there is not in

So if that is the rationale that the district court

MR. POE:

Yes, Your Honor.

This Court can find

9

-- first of all, that the local Democratic and Republican

10

Parties were not named in -- in the action, and as to why

11

they were not in the action in lower courts I do not know.

12

But the State has its interests and has to protect those

13

interests whether those parties are involved in litigation

14

or not.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, when you -- would you

16

say that the rationale on which the district court

17

rejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?

18

MR. POE:

No, Your Honor.

Under Monroe before

19

this Court, I think the Court was looking to the

20

potential, the possibility, of course.

21

pattern we had at the trial court, it was a very minor

22

party wanting to -- or effectively poach voters from the

23

two major parties.

24
25

And as to the fact

But you have to look at the entire statutory
scheme and not just how it would apply.

It could be

applied by the Democrats or the Republicans.
But also more importantly, in Monroe this Court

3

clearly stated that a State does not have to wait until it

4

sees actual damage to its political or electoral system to

5

make reasonable decisions.

6

States should have the foresight to make those reasonable

7

determinations in an effort to prevent those -- those

8

potential evils from occurring if the likelihood of -- of

9

that is there.

In fact, this Court says the

And the district court made very --

MR. POE:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Poe, I -- I -- here I am.

Excuse me, Justice Scalia.
I suppose that if -- if I were

14

the party chairman of the Republican or Democratic Party,

15

I'm -- I might have defended your -- your State system if

16

I had been named as a party, but if I were not named as a

17

party, I'm not sure that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't decline

18

to come in as an amicus, even though I'm interested in the

19

outcome simply because I don't want to alienate my

20

Republican members by depriving them of the freedom, if

21

they want to do it, to go vote.

22

look sort of parsimonious, doesn't it, when you tell your

23

Republican members, I don't want you to vote in the

24

Libertarian primaries?

25

it doesn't hurt the Republican Party or the -- or the

You know, it makes you

MR. POE:

I would agree, Your Honor.

MR. POE:

10

They are, after all,

And they do like to keep their party

members as happy as they can.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Poe, may I just focus in

12

on exactly what the injury is?

13

vote with the Libertarians or that they don't vote with

14

their own party?

15

MR. POE:

Is the injury that they

The -- the injury is twofold, Your

16

Honor.

17

voting in the primary to which they have associated -- and

18

that is registering as a Republican or a Democrat -- if

19

they go to the polling place and at the last minute decide

20

to go and vote in the Libertarian Party primary, their

21

decision not to vote in the Republican primaries, when

22

candidates have been trying to -- to use voter lists

23

trying to get to their party members to vote --

24
25

And -- and first, it is the fact that by them not

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But wouldn't it be precisely

the same injury if they just didn't like the Republican

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

candidate in that particular election, decided to stay

2

home?

3

MR. POE:

Well, if they had already made the

4

decision to stay home, then they would not be voting for

5

the candidate, but they would also not be voting in

6

another party's primary.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How -- how are they hurt by

8

the fact that rather than staying home, they decide to

9

cast a vote for a minority party candidate?

10

MR. POE:

Well, the party is here because it has

11

the -- the possibility, for those who are not voting, of

12

changing the elections of the candidates.

13

also by --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I think

Well, it's very unlikely if

15

it's a party that is -- gets the small vote that this

16

party gets.

17

you still find the injury to the major parties because

18

they voted for the Libertarians or because they didn't

19

vote at all?

20

But you -- no matter how small the vote is,

MR. POE:

Well, because they voted either way of

21

voting -- or for voting in the Libertarians and -- and not

22

voting, they have changed and possibly have changed,

23

especially when they went to the --

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is there any evidence on the

question whether the -- the support for the major party

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

candidate is any smaller than it would have been if there

2

had been no Libertarian Party at all?

3
4

MR. POE:

There -- there's nothing in the record

that supports any of that.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and a very similar

6

question.

7

that those who would vote in the Libertarian primary are

8

the stay-at-home Republicans or the Republicans who would

9

otherwise have voted in the Republican primary?

10

Is there anything in the record that indicates

MR. POE:

There -- there is nothing in the

11

record.

12

some expert testimony as to the potential reasons for

13

people voting in a Libertarian primary such as purposeful

14

intent to do harm to Libertarians or walking in intending

15

to vote --

16
17

There was no type of polling.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There was some --

But that -- I mean, the

Libertarians are happy to have -- take that risk.

18

MR. POE:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
It seems to me if we don't know

20

whether the -- the Republicans who are going to migrate to

21

the primary are stay-at-homes or Republican voters, the

22

State has no basis even to say whether in fact the harm

23

it's trying to prevent is going to be affected one way or

24

the other by its rule.

25

MR. POE:

Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- there is a context or -- there is belief that it will

harm.

3

there's no -- there was only one other State that has a

4

open -- what we have termed in this litigation as a -- a

5

semi-open primary.

6

effectively come out of their one primary that says why

7

people are not voting, why they're voting in one primary

8

or not or the effects of that.

And there's been no polling in this action, and

9

And there's no data that has

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can give you --

Mr. Poe, I -- I -- why do you

10

rely only upon the damage to the Republican and Democratic

11

Parties?

12

might care a whole lot about damage to -- to Oklahoma's

13

system of election.

14

I frankly don't care much about that, but I

Why do you allow party designations?

I suppose

15

it is because you want people to know that there are

16

candidates who are associated with particular political

17

views.

18

say, we don't have any particular political views, we --

19

we just want to nominate, you know, whoever the most

20

people want to nominate, that just destroys the whole

21

purpose of -- of your system of allowing people to run

22

under a party label.

23

And to allow a party to, in effect, come in and

MR. POE:

What's the use of a party label?

And -- and, Your Honor, we -- we

24

provided that information and those interests to -- to the

25

district court.

And those are interests the State has.

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

It is if a party is running as a party and if the State --

2

there -- there may be an interest in it.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure --

It -- if it's running as a

4

party, it should run somebody who -- who shares the views

5

of the people in that party, which is somebody who is

6

nominated by -- by the people in that party, or at least

7

those people, joined by others who are not affiliated with

8

another party.

That seems to me to make a lot of sense.

9

And it seems to me to destroy that system if --

10

if you say, hey, we're -- you know, we -- we're going to

11

allow the Libertarian Party to say, you know, we don't

12

have any real views.

13

nominate somebody that most people like.

14

Republicans come in, the Democrats come in.

thing we want is to win.

That -- that is the premise, of

And -- and that goes back to another -- an

19

adverse effect on the State and the State's political

20

system is this Court has recognized -- it recognized it as

21

recently as Jones and it has recognized in other cases --

22

that there is a -- a party labeling or a party

23

identification that voters use in a general election.

24

if the poaching of members have changed the -- any of

25

those party -- those messages from that party, then the

20

ON BEHALF OF SOUTH DAKOTA, ET AL.,

21
22
23

AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHAERR:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

24

In the decision below, the Tenth Circuit stuck

25

-- struck down an election rule that has been adopted by

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

nearly half the States pursuant to their authority under

2

Article I, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding

3

elections.

4

made three fundamental errors that I'd like to address

5

briefly.

6

In so doing, the Tenth Circuit in our view

The first was the Tenth Circuit's per se

7

approach to determining whether the alleged burdens here

8

are severe.

9

course, because to our knowledge, this Court has never

That's an extremely important issue, of

10

invalidated a State election regulation under the First

11

Amendment without first finding that the burden at issue

12

was severe.

13

the Tenth Circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply

14

assumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any

15

regulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties

16

seeking to define the scope of their associational rights.

17

Mr. Poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a -- in

The burden on the party is also less severe than

a burden that this Court found acceptable in Burdick which

is that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot

three important reasons.

2

result of a -- of a spurned candidate joining another

4

The second reason that poaching is a significant

5

concern is that -- is that it can lead to efforts,

strategic efforts by -- by other parties to influence the

outcome of another party's primary.

8

we're in California in 2002 a few days before the

MR. SCHAERR:

19

scenario for -- in the California example, for example.

Take -- assume that the Democrats, instead of opening up

21

their own primary to Republicans, they strike a deal with

the Green Party such that the Green Party makes an effort

scenario and -- and one that the State is entitled to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. LINGER

MR. LINGER:

Justice Stevens, may it please the

Court:
The integrity of a political party should be
defined by the political party and not by the State.
The State interest that they have asserted here

22

and alleged is to prevent against draining, and draining

23

the State has defined as the inverse of raiding.

24

raiding, of course, is the State preventing and keeping

25

out of a political party disloyal voters of another party

coming in for a purpose to hurt that party.

2

draining is inverse raiding, then the State is saying that

3

it has an interest in keeping in to a political party

4

disloyal voters.

5

cross purposes that it has an interest to both keep out

6

disloyal voters from a political party's primary and at

7

the same time keep in disloyal voters.

8

Now, if

So the State is asserting and is at

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why is that inconsistent?

Because I mean, you're -- you're basically advocating that

10

the Constitution requires Alaska's rule, and I thought

11

that -- we got briefs on that, I think, in -- in the

12

previous case and a lot of other parties thought Alaska's

13

rule was not a wise rule, though that's up to Alaska.

14

to think that the Constitution requires that is

15

surprising.

But

The interest they assert is just the one you
said --

JUSTICE BREYER:

the Constitution -- and I'm asking.

had a special rule for minor parties, the interest that

14

they're asserting has very little to do with it.

15

don't see how you can have a constitutional rule that

would forbid -- allow you to open and drain, but wouldn't

12

MR. LINGER:

That's

I don't think the -- I think the

13

Constitution -- and the Court has recognized that it is

14

legitimate to protect against raiding because we can all

suppose how disloyal voters coming into a party could hurt

it.

Because these voters that would come in and vote in the

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which isn't that.

10

But the fact of the matter, this Court itself

11

has expressed skepticism about whether even party raiding

21

22

broad-based rule, and I don't interpret this decision and

23

I don't interpret the teaching of this Court in footnote

anything more intrusive into the political process than

asking for trouble and we would be asking for trouble if

8

we accepted that invitation.

MR. LINGER:

No.

I'm -- and as I said before, I

10

think the political party should be the one that defines

its integrity --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then -- then if you say that --

13

I want you to just respond in detail to the questions that

14

I think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were asking, as

15

I understand it, putting it dramatically, that if you win

16

this case, Alaska's system becomes the Constitution of the

17

United States.

18

I want to know why.

19

Now, that I know you think is not so, and

MR. LINGER:

Because, number one, first, let's

20

eliminate the 21 States that do not have political party

21

registration.

22

problem that we're worried about here, draining, and --

23

and the problem is going to happen simply because people

24

in those States, like President Bush's Texas, are free

25

from election to election to go to any primary they

MR. LINGER:

Justice Scalia, I respectfully

7

disagree because Alaska, unlike Texas, has political party

Also, they have a party option.

And most

10

have a sort of two-tier system where they recognize it

would be discriminatory to treat major parties and small

12

political parties the same.

13

example, the amici States here of New Mexico, Maryland,

14

they have political conventions for their -- they

15

recognize that that is something that shouldn't be applied

16

to the smaller parties.

17

Most of them like, for

But Oklahoma, of course, mandates primaries.

18

The Libertarians of Oklahoma are forced to have primaries.

19

They're forced to live under what is the most restrictive

20

ballot access and ballot retention laws, which limits the

21

amount of time they could be on the ballot.

22

The voter registration laws, as was cited in the

23

record of this case, as the trial judge found, of the 29

24

States that have political party registration, essentially

25

26 of them have -- they have free and open registration.

36
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

There are very few that limit things across the board like

2

Oklahoma does, and that's what makes this case unique.

3

And I think the footnote 13 in Tashjian talked

4

about looking at the particular facts and circumstances.

5

I think this case gives the Court an opportunity to fully

6

expand on that footnote, the full footnote, of course, as

7

I cited in the brief for the respondents, and that is to

8

say that all these are factors when you're analyzing any

9

State.

Is -- does it have political party registration?

10

Does it mandate primaries for even the little parties?

11

How much time is available to change your registration as

12

new parties come up?

13

The New -- State of New Hampshire, of course,

14

has found a way to deal with this problem, which Oklahoma

15

hasn't, which is that they allow new parties that are just

16

recognized.

17

to register in that party, they have an open primary.

18

That's one way to deal with it.

about that.

And the law and the workings of all these

3

registration laws in Oklahoma, because they are so

4

restrictive, prevent the Libertarian Party to get in the

5

position that the major parties have because they simply

6

can't get their people registered and stay registered with

7

the Libertarian Party because they're constantly being

8

purged and they're -- the people are frustrated.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would there be a way --

10

suppose, for hypothetical purposes, the Court were to say

11

-- you got a ruling that said there is no rule in the

12

Constitution that forbids a State, as a general matter, to

13

forbid this cross registration, this jumping, for a

14

reasonable time.

15

account the interests of minor as well as major parties.

16

Now are you foreclosed because of the circumstances of

17

this case from litigating whether 8 weeks is a reasonable

18

time and whether the disjunct between the period where you

19

become a party and that 8 weeks is unreasonable in the

20

circumstances or other specific things that you say work

21

to the disadvantage of the Libertarians?

22

But a reasonable time has to take into

MR. LINGER:

I think that's something

reasonable, but in this case it is unreasonable because

you simply don't have the opportunity to register.

want to appeal to people who don't want to register as

Libertarians and don't even want to be independent.

4

leanings, but they don't want to give up their party

MR. LINGER:

That -- that is part of the appeal.

There are obviously some people simply because of family

10

tradition or it may help them with their job or because

11

the Libertarians are controversial, some people may want

12

to keep it quiet and don't formally affiliate other than

they might wish to vote.

not simply those people but to many people, the vast

MR. LINGER:

We would like -- first, when you

2

have competition in ideals and in politics, it's always a

3

continuing process, and they're hoping to win all these

4

people over.

5

other political parties, but they are opening it up

6

because they have such a limited period of time in

7

Oklahoma when people can formally affiliate with the

8

Libertarian Party or, for that matter, any newly

9

recognized party.

10

They don't want these people to stay in

Think of it this way.

When counsel was talking

11

about the Rosario case where you -- the -- the State was

12

allowed to have 8 to 11 months and the Court found that

13

was acceptable to change your registration or the older

14

case of Kusper v. Pontikes where the Court found that 23

15

months in -- in advance to change your affiliation was too

16

much, in Oklahoma, whether it's 23 months before the newly

17

affiliate party gets recognized or 8 to 11 months, you

18

can't register with that party.

19

in Kusper v. Pontikes but was reasonable in Rosario, the

20

point is under either of those time periods, in Oklahoma

21

you can't register with a newly recognized political

22

party.

So if it was unreasonable

So how can that be reasonable?

23

The Libertarians do not have the opportunity.

24

Newly recognized parties under Oklahoma law do not have

25

the opportunity to get their people in in time, to the

noted in the brief, Oregon where there are substantially

more --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What did -- what did you seek

6

in this action?

7

did you seek just more time to -- to register?

8

thought you -- you sought to overturn the -- the system

9

entirely and -- I mean, maybe you asked for too much.

10

What did you seek in this action?

MR. LINGER:

Did --

I -- I

As -- as to the Libertarians, we

11

asked that we have a party-option open primary, which I

12

think is acceptable, and it's what New Hampshire does.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So more -- more time might be

14

-- might be a good idea, but that wouldn't satisfy your --

15

your complaint here.

16

MR. LINGER:

18

matter how much time you're given --

19

MR. LINGER:

If you go -- if you go -Your -- your complaint is no

The -- the legislature -- if -- if

20

the law is overturned and the Tenth Circuit is affirmed,

21

the legislature might go back in then and address the

22

problem and they might come up with some solution as they

23

did back in 1980 when it became apparent to them that they

24

had set up a system where Libertarian candidates couldn't

25

be candidates for State office because they couldn't be

affiliated with a party with 6 -- for 6 months.

2

the change that is set forth in the statute that allows 15

3

days after the party is recognized.

4

They made

It might very well be that a possibility the

5

legislature could pursue that could solve this problem, a

6

problem created by the State of Oklahoma, would be to

7

allow a period of time after a party is recognized for

8

voters, not just candidates, but for people who just want

9

to vote in the primary to change.

10

That might be one

solution.

11

Or it might be, as in the State of New

12

Hampshire, where they allow that if it's a newly

13

recognized party and we recognize that all these people in

14

the State never had the opportunity to register in this

15

party, then they will have an open primary there.

16

So I don't think there's one solution for this

17

problem, and I think when the law, hopefully, is held to

18

be unconstitutional as it applies to Libertarians, then

19

the Oklahoma legislature can come in and perhaps remedy

20

the situation then.

21

Now, this -- this case is one in which there are

22

some other factors that have to be considered, and that is

23

the importance that is put on First Amendment rights to

24

political association.

most difficult.

The finding was that the

And finally, the State has imposed, I think

11

unwisely, primaries on these small political parties.

12

But other than the Libertarians and the Reform

13

Party, there have been no other minor parties on the

14

Oklahoma ballot.

15

ourselves, as the trial judge in fact commented on, is

16

whether or not the law is simply the result of the

17

concerns of the major parties.

18

State legislature in Oklahoma went out of its way to try

19

to interfere with the rights of Libertarians.

20

think that they never really considered them, and that is

21

why this Court has said on a number of occasions that when

22

the rights of independent voters and small parties are

23

impacted by legislation, that this Court should exercise

24

more strict and careful scrutiny there because --

way for -- there's no way for a voter who's in the

4

Libertarian Party because of the unreasonable deadlines to

change and because of the lack of opportunity, there's no

6

way that they can register.

7

to register as a Libertarian, as the candidate of the

he wanted to.

that is one significant difference with Timmons.
And also, of course, I couldn't -- I would also

over, whether they wouldn't have voted at all, or whether

16

they didn't have the chance to register as Libertarians,

17

or whether they simply are inspired by the particular

candidates, I don't think in that situation that that is

don't think it is rational. And in fact, as far as being
