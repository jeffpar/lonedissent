JUSTICE STEVENS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRA S. SACKS

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SACKS:

Justice Stevens, and may it please the

Court:

11

With the Court's permission, the State of New York,

12

as amicus, will address issues related to the Treaty of Buffalo

13

Creek and I will address the other reasons why aboriginal title

14

and other Indian possessory rights to the properties at issue

15

were extinguished long before the Oneida Indian Nation purchased

16

the properties in 1997 and 1998.

17

The asserted basis for tax immunity in this case

18

appears at page 1 of respondent's brief which is that the

19

Oneidas have at all times held a tribal possessory right in the

20

properties.

21

aboriginal title or under the Treaty of Canandaigua, in 1805 and

22

1807 when these properties passed out of tribal hands, the

23

passage of 190 years has extinguished that right.

24

years, these properties have been in private non-Indian hands,

25

have been freely alienable, have been transferred to innumerable

But even if there was a tribal possessory right,

innocent purchasers and have been subject to the full panoply of

2

state and local laws including taxation.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is it your position that

4

whenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the

5

Nonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer?

6

why is this different?

7

MR. SACKS:

No.

And if not,

It is not our position that that

8

would be a valid transfer if there was a violation of the

9

Nonintercourse Act.

The principal issue here is whether, after

10

of the passage of 190 years, there remains a possessory right.

11

If there was a violation of a Nonintercourse Act in 1805 and

12

1807, Justice Kennedy, we believe the Oneida Indian Nation has a

13

-- under this Court's decision in Oneida II -- a federal common

14

law damage suit against New York State or against the United

15

States of America for failing to exercise its fiduciary duty.

16

But after 190 years, in 1997, they did not have a possessory

17

right to these properties.

18

The possessory right we're talking about, aboriginal

19

title or some other tribal possessory right, isn't just a

20

concept.

21

possessory rights, it's a right to current possession.

22

under this Court's decisions in cases such as Felix versus

23

Patrick and Yankton Sioux, and Williams and Mitchell and Santa

24

Fe, all of which were cited in the dissent written by Justice

25

Stevens, for the, for members of dissent in Oneida II, tribal

1

possessory rights are barred by that passage of time, the change

2

in the character of the land and the innumerable innocent

3

purchasers.

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why does not having a possessory

right mean that the city could tax them, or the State?

6

MR. SACKS:

The basis for the tax immunity here is

7

that this land does not have Indian country status.

8

land to have Indian country status, it has to be, in our view,

9

under this Court's Venetie decision, Federal set-asides and

10

For this

Federal superintendence.

11

If you look at how the Oneida Indian nation got this

12

land in 1997, it wasn't because of any set-aside by the Federal

13

Government in 1794, even if there was, and I will get to that

14

later.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm just thinking, that suppose

16

you have a reservation but the tribe doesn't have a possessory

17

right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some

18

kind of long-term lease or a sale to a house that's owned by

19

somebody else who is not a member of the tribe.

20

-- am I right that the city or the county in which that

21

reservation sits can't tax it anyway?

22

MR. SACKS:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

I would think

I absolutely agree with you.

All right.

So if you were to say

24

the tribe does not have a possessory right, they can't go in and

25

eject all the people who are living there and built houses over

2

them.

3

That doesn't mean still that you could tax

MR. SACKS:

But your hypothetical, Your Honor,

4

presupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a

5

possessory right subject to lease.

6

did not exist because the Oneida Indian nation had no rights

7

with respect to the land at all in 1997.

8

be enforced.

9

The possessory right here

Those rights could not

And for the right not to be -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, they couldn't be enforced

10

against certain innocent purchasers but when the land is

11

reacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was

12

an extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation

13

was at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act.

14

And if we hold against you on the ground that there was no

15

extinction of aboriginal title and there was no disestablishment

16

of the reservation, then it seems to me that when they

17

reacquire, we get to exactly the point that Justice Breyer

18

raises and that is, once they reacquire the land, why does it

19

become taxable?

20

reassert itself?

21

Why does its nontaxable status not simply

MR. SACKS:

I think that you have to look at the

22

definition of Indian country.

23

Indian country, it requires, with respect to the properties

24

we're talking about, federal set-aside and federal

25

superintendence.

If you look at the definition of

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're saying if the original

2

establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was

3

literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the State of

4

New York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal

5

title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating a

6

reservation, that it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?

7

MR. SACKS:

If I understand the question that you

8

asked, Your Honor, if the title came from the State of New York,

9

for example, in the --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's assume the title is

11

aboriginal.

12

giving this land to the Indians, e.g., in the Kansas situation.

13

It's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished.

14

Nothing in an act of the United States says we're

Are you saying that if that is the source of the

15

title as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you,

16

that it cannot be Indian country?

17

MR. SACKS:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. SACKS:

No, Your Honor.

No.

Okay.
In a situation where there was

20

continuing aboriginal title, similar to the Senecas in the State

21

of New York where New York State did not terminate the

22

aboriginal rights of the Senecas, there need not be

23

congressional act, there need not be congressional or treaty

24

action to establish the reservation.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So this part of your argument

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

depends on our accepting your position on the Treaty of Fort

2

Schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later

retrocession, is that correct?

12

and local jurisdiction for 190 years and this Court observed, in

13

Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, and I acknowledge it was in a different

14

context, but this is important, that stable rules of

15

jurisdiction and sovereignty are important in situations like

16

this where what we're dealing with is very few -- 1 percent of

17

the land in the City of Sherrill is owned by the tribe.

What extinguished the aboriginal title is the

19

20

land now comes back into tribal jurisdiction, to paraphrase,

21

seriously disrupts the justifiable expectations of the community

22

and that's not just a hypothetical in this case.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And as this

I know that, but I mean, then it

24

seems to me if one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole

25

title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens, simply

8

it that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't

10

throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does

11

reflect the passage of time.

13

people's expectation of living in the houses that they bought,

14

that throwing someone out of his house would involve.

Here's what impacts the expectations.

16

What impacts the expectations is the following.

an example that appears from the joint appendix on the Court of

18

Appeals from pages 1263 to 1277.

19

I'll give you

In the year 2000, the City of Oneida cited two

20

Oneida Indian Nation businesses, a convenience store and a gas

21

station, for 16 fire code violations.

22

Court's decision in Brendale said, we're not governed by the

23

local fire code.

more than just the interference, the issue of taxation, the

issue of sovereignty is whether a gas station is going to blow

up or burn down JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It is a matter, is it not, of

3

whether the tribe now has sovereignty over this parcel of land?

4

Is that's what's at the bottom of the question?

5

MR. SACKS:

I think in terms of the problems for the

6

citizens of the City of Sherrill, taxation is part of it, and

7

sovereignty is part of it, and they go hand in hand.

8
9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

If the tribe has sovereign -

sovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably

10

the city can't tax it.

MR. SACKS:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

with the Oneida II case decided in 1985?

14

MR. SACKS:

So we have to decide that, do we?
Yes, you do, Your Honor.
All right.

Now what do we do

This, the position we're taking here is

15

fully consistent with Oneida II.

16

that there was a violation of federal common law principally

17

because of a violation of the Nonintercourse -- Indian Trade and

18

Intercourse Act in 1795.

19

at that time, with the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.

to deal with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek.

with evidence of the numerous authorized New York State treaties

in 1840 through 1846 that diminished this reservation, that the

1

interested parties fail to cite the, what they now assert are

2

the dispositive acts?

3

MR. SACKS:

No, Your Honor.

I think that principles

4

of stare decisis still govern and I think what, and this is

5

consistent with the position that we have taken with respect to

6

the passage of time extinguishing the possessory right, is what

7

this Court for stare decisis purposes found in Oneida II was

8

that there was a violation of federal common law with respect to

9

a transfer that was very different than this transfer, without

10

any examination of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and without any

11

examination of the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But there wouldn't have been a

13

violation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if

14

this were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred.

15

MR. SACKS:

Your Honor, that might or might not be

16

correct, depending on how one views the scope of the

17

Nonintercourse Act.

18

Nonintercourse Act to apply to Indian reservations, even state

19

reservations, as the Second Circuit in Mohican Tribe has held,

20

then the Treaty of Fort Schuyler could have terminated all

21

aboriginal title;

22

established a state reservation for the Oneidas; and the

23

Nonintercourse Act of 1790, two years later, could have

24

prohibited the sale of those lands even though it was a state

25

reservation and under state jurisdiction.

the first portion of your question, Justice Ginsburg, I think

the against the counties in the land claim.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What goes with the taxes?

You've

10

said that the other effect will be that whenever the Oneidas buy

11

a piece of property that is within this former reservation, and

12

of which only 1 percent is now owned by Indians, whenever they

13

buy a piece of property, that property is taken off the tax

14

rolls.

MR. SACKS:

context of the times, when looking at how would the Oneidas have

how to preserve their aboriginal title when they wanted to do so

and the Oneidas didn't do that.

Oneida sovereignty in New York State.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What you seem to be asking is to

infer from that treaty that the prior unlawful land sales of the

Oneida's New York reservation were somehow ratified.

do is change the language of the treaty which makes clear that

They sold almost all of that land within the following six years

after proclamation of the treaty. So the contemporaneous history

squares with that.

So it may have been that the Oneidas wanted to
And they did.

10

It's very similar to what happened in Santa Fe, in

11

which this Court said there was a reservation that was created

12

for the Santa Fes, there was some indication of acceptance of

13

that reservation, and that acceptance was sufficient to

14

terminate the tribe's sovereignty over any lands outside of the

15

reservation that was provided to them, even though many of them

16

did not in fact remove to that land.

17

Here the Oneidas received much more.

Not only did

18

many of them sell the lands and leave immediately but they

19

received the benefit of their bargain by recovering compensation

20

for the Kansas lands from this Court in New York Indians.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the precise language that

you think relinquished, changed the sovereignty that -- changed

First of all, in the recitals, it states that the

2

purpose of the treaty is to carry out the Government's policy in

removing the Indians from the east to the west of the

4

5

Article 2 also notes that the Kansas lands will be a

6

permanent home for all Indians now residing in the State of New

York as well as elsewhere, and Article 4 states that there will

be an exercise of sovereignty.

14

a question that several members of the Court have raised which

15

is what is the impact of this decision here.

16

perspective of the State of New York and the localities, it's

17

very serious because it does concern whether or not the tribe

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. SMITH

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

5

MR. SMITH:

Justice Stevens, and may it please the

Court:

6

There was a suggestion in answer to an earlier

7

question that the Oneidas have changed their position about

8

whether the land is alienable when in their hands.

9

correct.

10

That's not

There is nothing in the record to suggest that.
What the record does suggest at page 213 of the

11

joint appendix is that Sherrill has changed its position.

12

wanted an easement on Oneida land in 1997 and at that page of

13

the appendix, you will see that Sherrill went to the Department

14

of the Interior for Federal approval of the easement under

15

Federal law, understanding at the time the Oneida's position and

16

the Federal law principle that the land wasn't subject even to

17

an easement absent the Secretary's approval.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

So you're saying your position was

19

and is that it's not inalienable without the approval of the

feds?

21

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

And the land, when the Oneida's

22

possession of the land, actual possession is unified with their

23

underlying Federal property and treaty rights, the land is

24

inalienable and cannot be sold today out of the Oneida's

possession any more than it could 200 years ago.

It's, there is an

10

unusual twist to it, and it arises from the fact that there were

11

illegal transfers 200 years ago.

12

Oneida II decision and it has been followed by the lower Federal

13

courts that there may be equitable principles that constrain

14

remedies in a course of order to be entered in a land claim

15

action brought by a tribe that is out of possession, but the

16

equitable principles that are at stake here are very different

17

and they don't involve the same --

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

There was a suggestion in the

Well, if you prevail in this

19

case, then could suits be brought by the tribe to evict current

20

owners of land on the historical Oneida 300,000-acre

reservation?

22

MR. SMITH:

No, Justice O'Connor.

The Courts have

23

ruled that we may not do that and it is the position and I will

24

say it clearly here today that the Oneidas do not assert a right

25

to evict landowners in the land claim area.

We are not waiving any of the underlying rights that involve

6

right to possession under Federal law and aboriginal rights and

7

the point I'm making should not be construed that way.

that he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award

Now, I'm saying I would normally interpret that,

MR. STEWART:

Justice Stevens, and may it please the

Court:

21

I would like to address, first, the City's argument

22

that the long passage of time renders it improper to give the

23

tribe a tax exemption on lands that have recently been

24

purchased.

25

That argument is wrong for three reasons.
First, if we are correct that the tribe had

Alderson Reporting Company

federally protected title as of the 1790s and that that Federal

2

protection was never validly extinguished, then the fact that

3

the tribe was out of possession of the relevant lands for nearly

4

two centuries is, itself, a distinct and substantial legal

5

wrong, and it would be adding insult to injury to say that

6

precisely because the tribe had suffered that initial injury, it

7

should be disentitled to take advantage of a tax exemption that

8

would otherwise flow from its possession of --

argument at all.

make what the nature of the wrong is, whether it's dispossession

14

or not?

15

I mean, it's just a general rule that, where

MR. STEWART:

And what difference does it

Well, I think it -- I think it's

important to distinguish between two different types of delay.

Congress creates a reservation, once it confers explicit federal

protection on particular lands, the reservation can be

15

diminished or disestablished only by act of Congress; it can't

The Court, in Atkinson Trading and in

Montana versus United States, before that, had said that the

tribe may be able to regulate conduct on non-Indian lands to the

extent that the conduct involves voluntary transactions with the

11

tribe or its members or to the extent that the regulation is

12

necessary in order to protect the tribe's sovereign over the

makes clear that, even when the great bulk of the land is owned

conduct on the non-Indian parcels is sharply limited.

would be doubly true in a tract of this nature.

Now, there isn't a

10

categorical rule of Federal law that says that States and

11

localities absolutely cannot regulate conduct on tribal lands

12

within the reservation.

13

there's certainly a thumb on the scale in favor of an exemption

14

from state and local regulation where tribal reservation lands

Rather, there is a preemption test -

Well, the Court, in the New York

As distinct from the Wisconsin

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's entering into the treaty.

But when it came to compensation, was there an indication that

they were being compensated for anything other than Kansas land,

15

which they had obtained as a result of ceding their Wisconsin

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. STEWART:

No.

No.
Okay.

The compensation was strictly for the
