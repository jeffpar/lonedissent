ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

murder of Mary Jane Stout.

grounds.

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. COLE:

That is correct, Your Honor.
At the end of the day.

There was a separate mitigation

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, the State said that they

-- they thought there was evidence to support that.

said, I don't believe it's necessary for this court to

5

conclude he was the actual shooter, and that's in the

joint appendix at 186.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. COLE:

The court -- or I'm sorry.

The

10

prosecutor argued that there was sufficient evidence to

11

show it.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And was there evidence at the

13

recent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers

14

relied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was the

15

triggerman and the murderer?

16

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, after -- at the time of

17

the original sentencing hearing there was no other

18

evidence, this new evidence of which he complaining -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I guess my concern

actually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in

13

light of what's happened, than with the guilty plea.

14

I suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivably

15

he's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.

16

MR. COLE:

And

I -- I guess that would be

17

conceivable, Your Honor, although I note that there's only

18

one due process claim he's making.

19

of constitutional error claim predicated on the Due

20

Process Clause, and if there was no due process violation

21

with respect to his conviction, which is the claim that he

22

was pressing before the Sixth Circuit, there's similarly

23

no due process violation with respect to his sentence.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

He's making one form

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

any due process claim insofar as it applies to the

2

sentencing?

3

Do you think that's waived?

MR. COLE:

Is that clear?

No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that.

4

In his Sixth Circuit briefs, he does -- in a section

5

that's entitled I hereby challenge my conviction, he does

6

also note in that section that he's got some concerns

7

about his sentencing hearing.

8

So I don't know that he's

But I don't believe that there's a valid due

conviction or his sentence.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do you argue that if there

12

is no due process violation with respect to the actual

13

plea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with

14

respect to the sentence?

15

MR. COLE:

Well, because his theory, Justice

16

Souter, is the same with regard to both.

17

the use of this -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He says this -

Yes, but we -- we may say the

19

theory really is -- is not sufficiently relevant with

20

respect to the plea but that it is with respect to the

21

sentence.

22

MR. COLE:

That's conceivable, Your Honor.

understand that the -- we understood the Sixth Circuit

24

opinion to be directed toward his conviction.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But did he take the second step

15

and say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the

triggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?

17

MR. COLE:

In so many words, Your Honor, in

connection with the mitigation phase, in -- in connection

19

with the factual basis hearing even, he put on the

Justice O'Connor's question.

said, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in

fact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was,

an effect on the court's determination whether the death

penalty should follow.

1

that judge is -- he said, well, it's conceivable, although

2

it wouldn't affect guilt, we would have come out with a

3

different sentence, and then going from that statement to

4

nothing, just a denial without explanation.

5

want us to infer from that silent denial that the judge

6

must have resolved his own difficulty and decided it

7

wouldn't make any difference on the sentence.

8
9

MR. COLE:

You -- you

Well, A, I think that's an inference

that's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the

10

motion, but B, in any event, there's been an independent

11

reweighing of all of the evidence in the Ohio intermediate

12

appellate court and that court said that -- very

13

specifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the

14

principal -- or principal offender, the actual shooter -

15

we do believe that.

16

sentence here would be appropriate.

in Clemons that an independent reweighing by an appellate

court of the evidentiary record can be sufficient to

2

MR. COLE:

Well, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,

3

the -- the evidence wasn't available at the time of the

4

original sentence.

5

the record at the time of the original sentencing hearing,

6

of course, can't violate due process.

7

So the failure to have that part of

And then the question would be, did something

8

that happened later violate due process?

think it can be the case that anytime new evidence comes

But I just don't

10

up that might cause a judge to say, boy, if we'd have had

11

that evidence before when we -- when we reached the

12

sentencing decision, we might have reached a different

13

result -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what -- what is the rule

15

if there are two successive -- there are successive trials

16

with different defendants and there can only be one

shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is

the shooter?

to begin all over again with both?

What should be the rule, or does the -- does

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, I -- I think that's a

great question.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. COLE:

Do we flip a coin?

Well, I -- I think the point is

13

probably both would have some kind of claim in that I

14

don't think the State can pursue and convict two people on

15

necessarily inconsistent theories because at that -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why is that?

I mean, it

17

seems to me due process requires that there be enough

18

evidence to -- for a jury to find beyond a reasonable

19

doubt that -- that the person was the shooter.

20

-- if there is, indeed, in both cases enough such

21

evidence, it seems to me there is no denial of due

22

process, and that the usual manner of accommodating for

23

that apparent injustice is -- is for the Governor to grant

24

clemency to one of the two, have him figure out which one

25

of the two wasn't the shooter, or to apply for -- for

I -- I agree with that, Your Honor,

gently.

17

and one of the old saws of American law is -- is it's

18

better one guilty person should go free than that one

19

innocent person should be punished.

20

knows, as a matter of fact, that it secured two

21

convictions for a crime that only one committed, the State

22

knows at that point that it's punishing at least one

23

innocent person and that might violate -

has made two arguments:

And the question -- I think the due process

2

question is whether the State can pursue those

3

inconsistent arguments, even if it starts out innocently

4

doing it, but can it pursue two inconsistent arguments

5

knowing that in one case the argument must be for a false

result, without there being any kind of -- of process to

correct the State's inconsistent positions?

8

mean, what's your response to that?

MR. COLE:

think they're -- he was without process.

13

What -- I

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Stumpf had
He got all the

Oh, he could -- he could get

14

into court, but as I understand it, there was no

15

recognition here that there is -- that there is in fact

16

something wrong with the two inconsistent -- or the two

17

arguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will

18

necessarily result in one false conclusion.

19

MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, the -- again, the

20

intermediate appellate court independently reweighed this

21

evidence and concluded that even if we conclude that Mr.

22

Stumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our -- our

23

conclusion -- it isn't, but even were we to conclude that,

24

the death penalty would still be appropriate here.

there's been an independent reweighing of the evidence

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe -- maybe that's enough.

3

Let me, with respect to that, just ask you one final

4

question.

5

to be sure.

6

And I'm assuming the -- the answer, but I want

I assume that at the point of this intermediate

7

court's reweighing, the intermediate court was aware of

8

the -- the evidence of -- of -- the hearsay evidence of

9

Wesley's confession and was aware that the State argued in

10

the second case that Wesley was the triggerman.

11

correct?

12

MR. COLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Am I

He -- the

13

prosecutor, in fact, stipulated to the admissibility of

14

the Eastman and the Wesley evidence from Wesley's trial

15

back into the Stumpf proceeding in the original trial

16

court before the two judges -- the two of the three judges

17

that were remaining at that point, and then -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. COLE:

20
21

And -- and I take it also -

That was part of the record on

appeal.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- stipulated or represented or

22

admitted, whatever, that in fact the State had argued in

23

the second case that Wesley was the triggerman.

24
25

MR. COLE:

I believe so, Your Honor.

The

indictment in Wesley's case included a specification that

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

he was the principal offender, so at the very least, the

2

indictment would -

3
4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because of being -- because of

being the triggerman.

5

MR. COLE:

The only way to be the principal

6

offender under that specification is to be the triggerman.

7

So that -- that's clear from the face of the indictment in

8

-- in Wesley's case that the State had argued that.

9

Now, the jury, importantly in Wesley's case,

10

found that he should be acquitted on that aggravating

11

circumstance.

12

one of the aggravating circumstances that the State could

13

rely on in seeking the death penalty in Wesley's case, and

14

the jury specifically rejected that aggravating

15

circumstance and -- and found that the State had not

16

proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.

17

It's not an element of the crime, but it's

Throughout the -- throughout the appellate

18

process, with regard to the sentence, the State's attorney

19

argued that, yes, there's evidence in the record from

20

which you could conclude that he's the actual shooter, but

But, General Cole, isn't there

10

a distinction between eligibility for the death penalty

11

and actually making the decision to impose the death

penalty?

13

of course.

14

not likely that the sentencer would be more likely to

15

sentence the defendant to death if the sentencer thought

16

he had been the actual shooter?

And it's perfectly clear -- you're dead right,
He's eligible under either theory.

MR. COLE:

But is it

I -- I think it's definitely a fact

18

that the court weighs, although here we have evidence that

19

at least one Ohio court took that possibility into account

20

and said even in light of that fact -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

MR. COLE:

Right.

-- we still conclude that the death

23

sentence is appropriate.

24

that in this case it in any way would change the outcome.

number of Ohio judges that have JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I understand the facts, even

prosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband,

Right.
And then there was some

discussion that the -- that the lying, seriously wounded

was shooting of the wife.

certainly falls well within the -- the range of

judges are sitting there, someone might have thought,

well, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he

actually pulled the trigger on the wife.

that.

to impose capital punishment without thinking I know that

It could be that people don't want

Now, I guess that's the problem because at that

time on reopening, the State told that panel of judges

20

pretty clearly by implication that the State thought that

the evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger,

22

even though at that point the State knew and indeed

referred to the statement to -- you know, the confession

MR. COLE:

Mr. Wesley.

But, Your Honor, I'm not sure that

evidence necessarily showed that Wesley was the shooter

versus Stumpf.

That was one person's testimony.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the trigger are Mr. Wesley and Mr. Stumpf, and they have

every reason to point their finger at the other person.

So if that's -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but wait.

At the end of

Who did the -

7

who was the last person the State pointed its finger at?

8

You -- you told me in -- in response to earlier questions

9

that when the case back before the two remaining members

10

of the panel, that in fact the State brought the -- called

11

to their attention the fact that Wesley had confessed and

12

-- and it was -- it was clear one way or another that -

13

that they had argued in Wesley's trial that he was the

14

triggerman.

15

When they -- at that point when they are back

16

before the two remaining members of the panel in Stumpf's

17

case, did the State say we now go back to our original

18

position that Stumpf was the triggerman and Wesley wasn't,

19

or did they say we think -- we think Wesley is the

20

triggerman and Stumpf wasn't?

The State -- and I would encourage

you could conclude that Stumpf was the shooter, but then

4

the State says even deleting that finding, even if you

5

don't agree with us, or even if you don't agree that's the

6

case, because the State isn't really saying this is our

7

position anymore, even if you delete that finding, there's

8

still sufficient evidence here to support a death penalty

9

against Mr. Stumpf.

10

It says, look, there's this new

We don't know.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems like from this record

Could -- could I get one fact?

11

Wesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed.

12

He -- he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?

13

MR. COLE:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct, Your Honor.
But what was introduced was -

15

was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who

16

said that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter.

17

who was the shooter was -- was as much an issue in

Wesley's trial as it was in Stumpf's trial, wasn't it?

MR. COLE:

So

As the court expressly -- or as -- as

the State expressly noted in its closing in that case JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but the State's position

was that the jailhouse informant had told the truth,

MR. COLE:

Honor, the -- the prosecutor was relatively agnostic,

frankly.

He said, look, you could conclude JUSTICE STEVENS:

He at least put in the

evidence.

6

MR. COLE:

He -- he put in the evidence, and

7

then he said, look, from this evidence you could conclude

8

that Wesley was the shooter.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You could also Normally you don't put in

10

evidence unless you think it will support a proposition

11

that you -- that you're in favor of.

12

MR. COLE:

Well, and Your Honor, I -- I think if

13

he could show Wesley was the shooter, that would, of

14

course, support a conviction against Wesley, but he

15

recognized that the jury didn't necessarily need to

16

believe that, and in fact, he wasn't relying on that in

17

order to secure the conviction.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you one final

19

question?

20

State -- after learning of the supposed admission in

21

Wesley, after taking Wesley's position, why shouldn't the

22

State, when it gets back to the Stumpf case before the

23

remaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut

24

bait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman

25

and we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think

As a matter of due process, why shouldn't the

1

he was the triggerman because we've taken this other

2

position?

3

stand there agnostic?

4

Why can the State, as a matter of due process,

MR. COLE:

Because, Your Honor, the State is not

5

the fact finder.

6

needs to put the evidence in and allow counsel for the

7

defendant, counsel for the State to argue positions, and

8

let the fact finder make the ultimate determination.

The judge is the fact finder.

With the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve

What should -- what -- was

Stumpf's initial plea hearing, Eastman hadn't appeared and

12

there was only Stumpf's testimony that he was not the

trial?

Is Wesley denied due process

19

MR. FREEDMAN:

20

was denied due process.

21

afterwards and ultimately at that trial they had -- the

22

Wesley jury had the opportunity to hear what happened in

23

the Stumpf trial, and they were able to weigh that case

this death penalty case.

That's something we submit has not happened in

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, do you concede that the

evidence presented in the Stumpf proceeding was sufficient

5

to support a finding of guilt as an aider and abetter?

6

Was there enough evidence that the fact finder could so

7

find?

8
9

MR. FREEDMAN:

Without the Wesley evidence, I -

I -- at the initial trial, I certainly would concede that.

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MR. FREEDMAN:

Right, right.

As -- as to -- as to whether the

12

evidence that you learn from the Wesley trial -- that's a

much closer question because the -- the aggravating factor

in this case -

She asked as aider or abetter,

MR. FREEDMAN:

Okay, all right.

that's correct.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And as to that, it seems to

me the guilty plea can stand and the only question that,

it seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing,

and I'm not sure that has to be overturned.

Is that still before us?

That -- that is correct.
Or has that been subsumed

somehow?
MR. FREEDMAN:

there's a -- there's a question of whether they even

challenge that.

Sixth -- the sentence was challenged by the Sixth Circuit

14

them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on a

4

specific intent element would be satisfied if -- if they,

5

by plan, went to the scene with -- with deadly weapons.

6

MR. FREEDMAN:

I believe under Ohio law that

7

that's not correct.

8

And I believe even the cases that are cited by the State

9

would infer that.

10

I mean, it's one of the few States.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the State argued

11

that knowledge -- that there's this plan, and they had a

12

common design to rob.

13

said that common design plus knowledge that an inherently

14

dangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the

15

felony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment

16

would be reasonably likely to produce death.

17

the State argued was the law of Ohio.

18

MR. FREEDMAN:

Is that right?

And then the State

That's what

But I -- I believe that they

19

needed a plan for -- for the killing of a witness.

20

needed that plan at the time for killing the witness.

21

It's not enough just to plan the robbery for the specific

22

intent.

to refer you to page JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the

2

Ohio law?

3

MR. FREEDMAN:

I believe so.

That's my reading

4

of the Sixth Circuit opinion.

5

element of -- of intent that was -- I believe that's the

6

-- the way I interpret the holding.

They said that there was an

7

I would like to refer you just to page 295 of

8

the joint appendix, even the last sentence or so in the

9

first paragraph.

They imply that in the Wesley trial,

10

talking about the same scenario, that there's not

11

necessarily a plan coming in to kill the witnesses.

There

12

would have to be a plan while they're in the house.

And

13

-- and the scenario of Mr. Stumpf dropping the gun I

14

believe is arguably that there's no specific intent.

15

I -- I would just like to sum up and indicate

16

that -- that the State argued in both cases urging the

17

death of two individuals based on killing the same person,

18

and ultimately there was not adequate review in Mr.

19

Stumpf's case indicating that he would have gotten the

20

death penalty notwithstanding Eastman's testimony,

21

notwithstanding their position that he would have gotten

22

the death penalty as an aider and abetter, which is a

23

rather rare circumstance not only in Ohio but also in this

24

country.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. COLE:

Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your

6

question, under Ohio law you do not need to -- to plan to

7

kill the witness in order to have specific intent for

8

aggravated murder.

9

Washington and State v. Scott cases that we cite in our

I would refer the Court to the In re

10

brief that say that participation in an aggravated robbery

11

where that's going to be done through force or violence or

12

in a manner reasonably likely to result in death is

13

sufficient to support a -- an intent -- a -- an inference

14

of specific intent.

15

that they planned to kill the witnesses.

16

So there's -- there's no need to find

If -- if I heard Mr. Freedman correctly, he

17

admitted that Wesley would not have a due process argument

18

here because he said the fact finders were apprised of Mr.

19

Stumpf's proceedings.

20

Mr. Stumpf's case.

21

available, as soon as Mr. -- as the prosecutor had

22

knowledge of Mr. Eastman's testimony, that testimony was

23

then placed back in the record for further proceedings in

24

the Stumpf matter.

25

don't think that the Due Process Clause requires -

Well, exactly the same is true in

As soon as that testimony became

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you mean at the hearing

on the motion to vacate.
MR. COLE:

Hearing on the motion to vacate and

further appellate review.
I don't think the Due Process Clause requires

6

the State to admit the ultimate truth of everything that

7

Mr. Eastman testified to at that other trial.

8

question was did they have a good faith basis for putting

9

him on, and they did.

The

And did they have a good faith

10

basis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said,

11

that the conviction and the sentence in Mr. Stumpf's case

12

were appropriate?

13

they did have a good faith basis for making that argument.

14

If we look at the arguments they made, they were

15

arguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in

16

the record.

17

Mr. Stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence

18

under Ohio law and that sentence is appropriate.

19

courts found, based on that argument, that Mr. Stumpf had

20

appropriately been sentenced to death.

21

And I believe the record supports that

You may believe it, you may not.

Either way,

And the

This Court has noted that the principal function

22

of habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated

23

under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large

24

risk that an innocent person will be convicted.

25

don't have that risk here.

Well, we

Stumpf has knowingly and

1

voluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that.

2

And if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no risk

3

that he received an impermissibly large sentence because

4

the prosecutor made the evidence available, and Stumpf's

5

counsel used that evidence and argued it, and the court

6

simply rejected it.

If the Court has no further questions, I'll
