ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1164

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

10

Congress enacted the Beef Promotion and Research

11

Act in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in the

12

beef industry.

13

respond to that situation through the promotion of its

14

products.

15

establishing a government program of promotion, research,

16

and consumer information.

17

prescribed the central message for advertising under the

18

Act, Congress established a government body, the Beef

19

Board, to administer and implement the program, and it

20

placed the program under the control of a Cabinet officer,

21

the Secretary of Agriculture.

22

The beef industry found itself unable to

Congress responded to that situation by

In the Beef Act, Congress

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Kneedler, will you tell

23

us how this case differs, if it does, from what was before

24

the Court in United Foods?

25

do you find?

What meaningful distinctions

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the important distinction

2

is that the two grounds that -- on which we are defending

3

the statute here were not addressed in United Foods.

4

particular, the government speech argument, that what I've

5

just said goes to, that the Court specifically did not

6

address because it had not --

7
8
9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

In

We've never addressed that in

-MR. KNEEDLER:

In none of these cases, and --

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- in these cases --

Right.
-- have we?

The Court has not.

And we think

14

that that is -- the critical point about this -- about

15

this case and these programs, these are government --

16

these are programs of government speech.

17

Congress, itself, prescribed the central message.

18

Congress established the government board, all of whose

19

members are appointed by the Secretary, to administer it.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I said,

Does it remain government

21

speech even if you don't say, "This is your government

22

speaking"?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

It -If you say, you know,

"America's cattlemen are speaking," is it government

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

speech?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

It does -- for purposes of this

3

Court's government speech doctrine, it does.

4

--

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why is that?

And I think

I mean --

And the Court -- the Court's

7

decision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration of

8

that.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but Rust did not -- Rust

10

was not a case in which the doctor was saying, "This is my

11

personal opinion, not the government's."

12

Justice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effort

13

to say, "This is -- this is paid for by" whatever it's

14

called, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, which

15

affirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

And here, as

Well, it -- all those statements

17

say -- and there are advertisements in the record that say

18

that the advertising is funded by America's beef

19

producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's accurate --- they pay for it.
-- but it also contains the

23

implication that who -- he who pays is the person whose

24

speech is being broadcasted.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but, again, in Rust, the

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

doctor who spoke -- I think the patient who went to see

2

the doctor for counseling would have -- would have assumed

3

or believed that the doctor was -- in the immediate

4

encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the

5

Court, in its subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as a

6

situation of government speech.

7

But the important point about what you've just

8

asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the

9

advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the

10

statute or the beef order.

11

requires that in the advertising.

12

perceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be

13

to invalidate the Act, but to, instead, provide that there

14

should be some different identification --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Neither the Act nor the order
And if the Court was to

Yes, but some people --- on the advertising, itself.
-- may be more resistant to an

18

-- to an ad that says, "Your government wants to eat --

19

wants you to eat more meat," than they are to an ad which

20

say, "The meat producers would like you to eat more meat."

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- and I think in Rust,

22

some people would have been resistant to the idea that

23

your government wants you to engage in family planning,

24

but what the -- what the Court said about Rust was that

25

the government had established a program with a central

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

message about counseling.

2

private individuals.

3

than Rust.

4

That was then carried out by

Here, this case is much stronger

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if you -- if you say

5

the Act can be -- say, because this is just an as-applied

6

challenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a

7

label that's not true, "This message is brought to you by

8

your friendly Department of Agriculture."

9

accurate.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

That isn't

Well, it would be accurate -And you're having us save the

statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, they're -- I'm sure that a

14

label could be devised that would -- that would be

15

accurate.

16

specifically approved by the Department of Agriculture.

17

The -- certainly, the Act and regulations provide that the

18

Secretary must approve every contract, every project for

19

advertising.

20

advertising, all copy --

The -- first of all, they are approved --

And, beyond that, the USDA approves all

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23
24
25

But, Mr. Kneedler --

-- that is actually to be used,

so there is specific approval by the Secretary.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is -- there's

another tape put out by the government, on meat, and that

-- what is the government speech?

2

has a position, and is presenting it.

3

America beef producers has a label on -- "Eat meat."

4

if you went to the Surgeon General, probably that message

5

would be "Eat meat moderately."

6

speech?

7

government speech where the message that you are saying is

8

the government's is not the message that the government is

9

putting out when it's dealing with its concern for public

10

Usually, the government
Here, we have
But

So what is the government

I don't know another case involving a claim of

health.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the government, in the

12

concern -- in situations where it may be concerned about

13

public health, doesn't say, "Don't eat meat."

14

may be nutritional standards.

15

nutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to.

16

But what the government is doing here is facilitating a

17

situation, facilitating promotion of a commodity.

18

It -- there

And USDA does have

There is a structural defect in a market like --

19

a market for a fungible commodity, and I think it's

20

important to understand what Congress was responding to

21

here.

22

lot of small producers, no one of those producers has an

23

incentive to advertise --

When you have a fungible commodity, when you have a

JUSTICE STEVENS:
fungible?

Mr. Kneedler, is meat

Or -- I think there are some steak houses that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

might disagree with that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there are -- there are --

3

there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I mean, even quality of meat

within the -- some is tougher than others.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well -It's not like milk or wheat.

But Congress could reasonably

10

determine, under this statute, that there are -- that

11

there are -- that beef has many things in common, that it

12

is a generic problem -- or generic food or generic

13

commodity, and the industry --

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

At some level, it certainly

15

is, I suppose.

16

different brands and different qualities.

17

it's still fungible, in a broad sense.

But, just as in wheat or corn, there are

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But I suppose

It is fungible in -May I ask you whether, in

20

deciding the government's speech doctrine, is it the

21

Secretary's formal right to control, as set out in the

22

statute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary's

23

actual record of oversight and participation?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

We think the -- we think the

formal legal control is sufficient.

And it -- the

Well, I think that -Is it possible to work that

MR. KNEEDLER:

What has -- what has been

proposed by the -- by the Respondents in this case, of

course, is to make it voluntary, so that people --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but, I mean, if you make

it --

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- can opt out.
-- totally voluntary, what

12

you're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef

13

people, rather than write a check, will say, "Oh, you

know, I make -- I raise cattle, but I don't think people

should eat beef."

MR. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes -Did we say, in the opinion,

that this was --

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not in Rust, but in the Court's

6

subsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth -- in

7

particular, in Velazquez -- this Court said that Rust has

8

come to be understood by the Court as a government speech

9

case, because the government prescribed the message, and

10

it's government speech whether or not the government

11

speaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the

12

message.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, for the precise purpose

14

at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference.

15

can fund private people for some things, and not fund them

16

for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But --- I think that's a really --- but there's really no --- strong proposition, that

22

whenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the

23

speech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

There's really no need to get to

that point here, because the Beef Board, which is the

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

entity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably

a government body.

under the Lebron test.

4

by the --

5

It's established by special statute
All of its members are appointed

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine.

But what you were

6

using Rust for was to establish the proposition that in

7

order to be government speech, it -- you don't have to --

8

you don't have to say, "This is the government speaking."

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11
12

Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And Rust doesn't stand for

that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

-- Right -- I think, as this Court

13

has come to explain Rust, as being a species of government

14

speech -- but, as I say, there is no need -- there is no

15

need for the Court to get to that situation.

16

that the government is the one in control of the speech

here critically distinguished -- distinguishes this case

18

from cases like Keller and Abood.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the fact

This is a question perhaps

20

more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like

21

your comment on it.

22

there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just

went into the general funds of the United States Treasury,

24

and then they used part of that money -- they had more

money for beef advertising, and the government did the

2

What would the Respondents say about that?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think -- I think they would say

3

that that -- that there's something different about

4

general taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes.

5

don't think there's any basis in this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Or is your answer to me, "Well, then, it's just formalism,

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

same thing, but I -- they were drawing a distinction

that's the solution, rather than having the industry, that

But then you'd come within the

6

protections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and

7

Massachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, there would be standing

objection -- objections at that point, but we think, in

10

terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a

11

person would have a First Amendment objection to paying an

12

excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes

13

are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis

14

in cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with

private association -- an association with private speech

--

Justice Kennedy, the assessments in

immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a

an important part in which this case is different from

goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising,

In response to that threat, because of the beef

rest of that dollar goes to things like producing

other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up

potential constitutional problem here.

There's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer

7

would think that just because an ad says it's funded by

8

the nation's beef producers, every single one of the

850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees

10

with every single statement --

MR. GARRE:

But what they would --

-- what they would, I think,

assume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, in

they would not assume from it is that it is what you and

17

Mr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government of

that it's not supported by any single piece of evidence

MR. GARRE:

Well, I highly doubt that, Justice

and this is at pages 46 and 47 of the trial record --

4

Respondents' own witness testified that the public was not

likely to attribute the message of the pro-beef ad to its

organization of beef producers.

that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no

you are acting whether it's government speech.

In Rust v.

10

Sullivan, even though I think you're certainly right,

11

Justice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called

12

government speech, in order to rationalize it, in

13

Rosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described.

14

question there wasn't, "Can people be made to support it?"

15

The question, rather, was, "Can the government insist on

16

staying within the terms of its grants and saying you

17

can't talk about abortion?"

18

the government force you to support it," the "it," if it's

19

government speech, doesn't help.

makes it a harder case for them, not easier.

that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to

even if it's going to, in the end, be in the

19

slaughterhouse -- we all die someday -- their fundamental

20

belief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared

22

reason that it makes a difference that they can't even

problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the

would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a

principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick,

12

if one person says, "I don't want numbers in your

want only numbers," the fact that every individual who has
