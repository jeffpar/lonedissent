ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MS. SAMEK:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the sole

12

purpose of increasing the penalties for money laundering

13

conspiracies.

14

Congress did not intend to abandon the overt act

15

requirement from money laundering conspiracies and for

16

good reason.

17

under 1956 is vast.

18

The list of specified unlawful activities

Anytime two or more people conspire or reach an

19

agreement to commit a crime that generates economic

20

proceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to what

21

they're going to do with the money get -- that gets

22

generated, how they're going to spend the money, which is

23

a potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide the

24

money, a potential 1956 offense.

25

charge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies

The Government would

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

without there even being a single overt act to demonstrate

2

that criminal intent had crystallized, that a money

3

laundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that steps

4

were being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggering

5

substantially higher penalties for the underlying offense,

6

and subverting -- subverting the overt act requirement for

7

conspiracy to commit the underlying offense.

JUSTICE STEVENS:
thing for me?

Did they have to prove an overt act in order

to establish venue?

11

MS. SAMEK:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13
14

Would you just clarify one

Excuse me?
Does the Government have to

prove an overt act in order to establish venue?
MS. SAMEK:

Our position is that the venue

15

provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies

16

requires that they establish an overt act and that venue

17

would lie -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, your -- you say the -

19

the statute requires.

20

of the conspiracy statute -- of the -- the substantive

21

statute itself, how do they establish venue.

22

to prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a

23

venue established -

I'm just asking if it independently

24

MS. SAMEK:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do they have

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that the only basis for

2

venue?

3

one of the bases for venue.

4

I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just

MS. SAMEK:

Our position is that the venue

5

provision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue

6

provision for money laundering.

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11
12
13

What does

it say?

9
10

But -- but read it.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Are we talking about section

1956(i)?
MS. SAMEK:

Section 1956(i) is the venue

provision.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And doesn't it allow it to be

14

brought where venue would lie if the completed money

15

laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has

16

been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed?

17

Isn't it an either/or?

18
19
20

MS. SAMEK:

Yes.

Our position is that when you

read the venue JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So you don't have to read it

21

as requiring venue.

22

there is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also

23

will lie where the completed offense would have occurred.

24
25

It's just requiring an overt act.

MS. SAMEK:

If

Certainly, but where the completed

offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts.

You

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering

2

transaction that there would be overt acts as part of

3

the financial transaction.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But why would they state it in

5

the alternative if -- why would they state it in the

6

alternative if the overt act were always required?

7

the --

8
9

MS. SAMEK:

That's

I agree that it's -- it's somewhat

confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the

10

Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if

11

two people conspired in -- if two people in Florida

12

conspired to commit a money laundering offense in

13

California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy

14

would lay in California.

But that doesn't respond to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, this Court has no

2

authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or

3

permissive.

4
5
6

Congress decides that.

MS. SAMEK:

And our position is that Congress

made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I mean, one can understand

7

that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may

8

be brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in

9

the district where venue would lie for the completed -- if

10

it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act

11

in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place,

12

then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive

13

venue or not.

14

But I don't see how there is even an argument

15

that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a

16

provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in

17

the district where the -- where venue would lie for the

18

completed offense or in any other district where an act in

19

furtherance took place.

20

say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in

21

furtherance took place?

22

MS. SAMEK:

How can you possibly read that to

Our position is that those are the

23

two alternatives for where venue would lie for a

24

conspiracy case.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, okay, but -- but then -

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act

2

took place is not the exclusive venue.

3

MS. SAMEK:

Our argument is that the first

4

clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an

5

overt act.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the rule provision

7

for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?

8

The ordinary provision for venue.

9

MS. SAMEK:

The ordinary provision for venue

10

would be that venue lies in the district where the crime

11

occurs.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MS. SAMEK:

Yes.

That would be -- in the money

14

laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h),

15

that would be where the overt act occurs.

16

consistent with it.

17

conspiracy.

19

requirement.

20

Our -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

So it would be

I thought the crime is the

The overt act may be an additional

MS. SAMEK:

The overt act is part of -- it's our

21

position that the overt act is required, and there needs

22

to be an agreement -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you will -- you will

24

concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy

25

crimes, in which an overt act is not required.

The

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Shabani case requires you to recognize that.

2

MS. SAMEK:

Correct.

And in those cases where

3

all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie

4

where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the

5

-- the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act,

6

it's our position that that's where venue would lie.

7

As a practical matter, if there is -- if -- if

8

this Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a

9

practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a

10

money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit

11

overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it

12

would be highly unlikely that there would not be some

13

overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the

14

offense.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you're saying that it

16

doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be

17

hard to prove.

18

MS. SAMEK:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As a But there are -- I mean, the

20

difference between statutes that say overt act is required

21

and those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many

22

such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani.

23

all the statutes that include no express overt act

24

requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly

25

include one, which is the argument you're making that we

But of

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

should adopt here?

2

MS. SAMEK:

That's correct.

And no.

There -

3

we have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore

4

read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision.

5

But this statute is unique.

The money

6

laundering statute is unique.

7

and we lay it out -- the statute in total -- in our reply

8

brief, starting at 1a -- the structure of 1956 strongly

9

supports our position that all Congress was doing, when

If you look at the statute

10

they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money

11

laundering conspiracies.

12

when Congress typically writes a complex statute, the

statute begins by setting forth all of the offense

elements.

would be extraterritorial jurisdiction.

the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be

2

increased to the same penalties as those prescribed for

3

the offense provision.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that there are other

5

statutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to

6

-- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the

7

penalty for it.

8

MS. SAMEK:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor I mean, it -- it could do that.

10

Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in

11

this section shall be subject to the same penalties as

12

those prescribed for the offense.

13

deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the

14

penalty for it.

15
16

MS. SAMEK:

And that could be

It could be construed as a

freestanding offense provision -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

provisions, aren't there?

19

MS. SAMEK:

And there are other such

There are not any other offense -

conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that

had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- like this it seems to me

3

contains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've

4

said, indeed, none is required and that at common law it

5

wasn't required.

6

MS. SAMEK:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8
9

That's true.
So why would we read it in

here?
MS. SAMEK:

Because text -- as this Court has

10

said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what

11

the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context.

12

So you have to look at where the provision is placed and

13

what Congress meant by that provision and look at the

14

statute as a whole.

15

If anyone -- if we look -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you look at this statute

17

as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in

18

it anywhere, do you?

19

MS. SAMEK:

You don't find the overt act

20

explicitly in the statute.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the fact that you

22

described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me

23

cuts against you.

24
25

MS. SAMEK:

No, because our position is that

placing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress'

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the

2

purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering.

3

The -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let's get And they were making it

6

unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in

7

18-371 or whatever it was.

8
9

MS. SAMEK:

It's our position that they're

incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in

10

furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the

11

legislative history.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's so -- if that's so,

13

then why does the venue provision which you were just

14

alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph

15

(2), a prosecution for an offense under this section.

16

offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought

17

in -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt

18

or a conspiracy offense under this section.

19

section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a

20

conspiracy offense under this section.

21

MS. SAMEK:

An

Not under

And it would be an offense under

22

this section because certainly the jury would need to find

23

that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering.

24

So it would be an offense in that respect.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I think that language

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

really cuts very hard against you.

under this section.

3

the section that defines the offense, not just the section

4

that provides the penalty.

5

It -- it is reading as though that's

MS. SAMEK:

I can see how you would read it that

6

way, Your Honor, but the offense --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9
10

A conspiracy offense

Only because I'm a reasonable

man.
(Laughter.)
MS. SAMEK:

The offense provisions set forth in

11

1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection

12

(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).

13

In 1988 -- when the statute was originally

14

enacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense

15

provisions.

16

Congress intended to create another offense provision,

17

they set forth (a)(1) -- the third sting provision which

18

is (a)(1)(iii).

19

provision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set

20

it forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have

21

added or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses.

22

When the statute was amended in 1988 and

If Congress intended to create an offense

Notably, the offense provision at issue here

23

does not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the

24

overwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include -

25

attempts are included with offenses.

The fact that

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress did not include attempts in this provision again

2

reflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a

3

conspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was

4

increase the penalty.

5

The placement of the -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you would expect at

7

least a cross reference to 371 for defining the

8

conspiracy, but there's nothing here.

9

MS. SAMEK:

That's true, and it clearly would -

10

it certainly would be clearer had they done so.

11

you take the language originally, this provision was

12

proposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to

13

371, and we lay out in our -- in the blue brief at page 12

14

what that amendment would have looked like, virtually

15

identical language to 1956(h).

But if

16

Certainly if you read it in subsection 371 -- if

17

you take the identical language and put it in section 371,

18

there wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit,

19

that Congress surely intended to include the overt act,

20

act in furtherance language and they were just talking

21

about increasing the penalty for money laundering.

22

makes our point that you look at the language, and

23

depending on where it's placed in a statute, it can have

24

different meanings.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

You have given a few examples

of a word may mean different things in different contexts,

2

but you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that

3

there is one -- where the entire string of words is

4

identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies,

5

and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the

6

other.

7

when you're talking about an entire provision where the

8

wording is almost identical than when you're talking about

9

one word used in different contexts.

I mean, you have a much harder argument to make

10

MS. SAMEK:

That's true, Your Honor, but as this

11

Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the

12

Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate

13

the common law concept of the terms that it uses.

15

indications.

In

They argued that at common law conspiracy
That is not our

18

But our position is that here there are contrary

19

indications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on

20

the placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look

21

to see if there are other indications.

22

legislative history -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And clearly in the

Yes, but there's nothing in

the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?

No, but that is not dispositive

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

because the placement the Congress has said -- I mean,

2

this Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to

you can't find any ambiguity.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. SAMEK:

Reading the whole text of the

statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set

14

penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty

provision for increasing conspiracies.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So I don't find anything

ambiguous in what you describe.

22

MS. SAMEK:

Well, we believe that 1956(h)

23

clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the

24

penalty.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Perhaps that's all they

17
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they

2

thought they were doing.

3

MS. SAMEK:

Well, if Congress inadvertently

4

omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior

5

occasions read into congressional silence terms,

6

definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out.

So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question

8

was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the

9

common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals

10

Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment

11

Act had language that talked about a generic burglary,

12

breaking and entering into a dwelling.

amended the act, they removed that language.

14

drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was

statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are

not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back

And the Court said even though there

So this Court can look at the legislative

11

history.

12

that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty.

Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were

14

prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission

15

of an overt act.

16

the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years,

17

based on what the object of the conspiracy was.

18

legislative history all reflects that fact, and the

19

Government admits that.

The purpose is clear.

Apparently there was some turf war going on as

to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and

11

this was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads

The offense is established by 371.

this allocation of responsibility among the various

prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.

If that's the case,

It's our position that when Congress

Congress

a judge would find that money laundering was the object of

the conspiracy.

16

would envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one

MS. SAMEK:

MR. MARCUS:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

24

the text of the statute contains no such requirement.

Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy

2

case does not require proof of an overt act.

statute was enacted against the background rule of

4

statutory construction that -- that a conspiracy

5

provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of

6

conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common

7

law, where proof of an overt act was not required for

conviction.

Third, the

This Court should adhere to its bright line rule

10

in this case because it provides clear guidance to

11

Congress and to the lower courts.

12

Petitioners seek to avoid application of the

13

bright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which

14

has -- none of which has merit.

15

those grounds here.

16

I will address a few of

First, the money laundering conspiracy statute,

17

section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the

18

general conspiracy statute, section 371.

19

does not contain any reference to section 371, and

20

petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United

21

States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined

22

elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is

23

defined.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If -- if 371 were repealed,

2

would it affect the actual practice in the Justice

3

Department?

4

for the other side that -- that the -- the United States

5

has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering

6

cases under 371.

7

I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs

Is that correct?

MR. MARCUS:

Well, my understanding is on -- on

8

occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case.

9

Where there are several objects to the conspiracy

10

sometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government

11

will just -- will charge a 371 -

12
13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But not in exclusively

laundering cases.
MR. MARCUS:

Generally, no.

There might be -

15

there might be an occasional example where it may have

16

been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked

17

section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but

18

generally speaking no.

19

prosecutions were done under 1956(h).

20

The money laundering conspiracy

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When -- when you say when there

21

are multiple objects, you're not getting the money -

22

You'd surely charge both

them as -- as separate offenses, but sometimes the

Government for -- just for purpose of simplification will

just charge one -- one agreement with multiple objects,

and one of those objects might be a money laundering

object.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

laundering, could you charge under 371?

If it were just money

MR. MARCUS:

Yes, you could charge under 371.

There's nothing that prevents the Government from doing

10

so.

11

the Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions

12

that essentially cover the same conduct, and the

13

Government has discretion to choose which one to use.

14

Generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy

15

statute contains higher penalties.

16

is -- is to prosecute those offenses under section

17

1956(h).

18

This Court has -- has held before, for example, in

So the practice today

Another -- another reading there -- another

19

reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision

20

should be rejected is that Congress modeled section

21

1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually

22

identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes

23

that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a

24

freestanding criminal offense.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is 846.

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MARCUS:

2

Petitioners also argue that because prior to

846, yes, in title 21.

3

enactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to

4

prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under

5

section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress

6

intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of

7

section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.

8

But this Court looks, first, to the text of the

9

statute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress

10

wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement,

11

it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h)

12

on the language from 371 or on the language from any of

13

the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that

14

contained express overt act requirements.

15

Congress chose a different model, the drug

16

conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court

17

held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement.

18

By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not

19

to require proof of an overt act because at the time it -

20

because at the time it acted, the background rule of

21

statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute

22

that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring

23

would be construed to follow the common law.

24
25

Petitioners point to silence in the legislative
history, but the silence in the legislative history on the

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling

2

evidence of -- of contrary intent that would justify

3

departing from the text of the statute and this Court's

4

bright line rule.

5

Finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision

6

for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was

7

enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy

8

statute at issue here.

9

Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in

That venue provision reflects

10

which money laundering cases can be brought.

What do you make of the -- the

argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that -

17

clause preceding, they were referring to a district in

18

20

what that terminology was -- was referring to was

I think that's the -- the best way to
I mean, otherwise, it could have

They wouldn't

They could have just had one

Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue

10

provision permits venue to be laid in any district in

11

which an overt act was committed.

12

conspiracy cases has always been that an overt -- that

13

venue can be laid where an overt act was committed

14

regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the

15

offense.

16

a conspiracy conviction did not rely -- depend on proof of

17

an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common

18

law where an overt act was committed.

19

But the rule in

At common law, as I said before, conspiracies -

The common law venue rule has been applied

20

consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such

21

as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not

22

require proof of an overt act as an element of the

23

offense.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Government has said that

-- that you have essentially waived their sentencing

guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your

brief to consider.

MS. SAMEK:

In the district court, there were

6

issues raised as to all defendants as far as various

sentencing enhancements.

Circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was

rejected.

In front of the Eleventh

As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing

10

enhancements were argued and was reversed on that

11

sentencing enhancement.

enhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but

13

it was not raised in this petition.

14

that this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that

15

it's still a valid -- a valid claim and that this Court

16

should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision

17

in Booker and Fanfan.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But there is still a sentencing

It was not the issue

Was the argument below that -

19

-- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was

20

unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts

21

MS. SAMEK:

The argument was that the facts

didn't support it.

Finally, Your Honor, we would -- Your Honors, we
