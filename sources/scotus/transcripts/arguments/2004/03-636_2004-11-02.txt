ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT H. DEIXLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DEIXLER:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the issue of whether the

11

California Department of Corrections, unlike every other

12

State in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, may continue its

13

more than 28-year, unexamined practice of routine, blanket

14

racial segregation of its prisoners.

15

The unitary practice in question here was

16

applied more than 350,000 times last year, not just to the

17

40,000 new prisoners entering the California system, but

18

to all 72,000 returning parolees and hundreds of thousands

19

of transfer prisoners such as the petitioner in this case,

20

Garrison Johnson, a petitioner who had been housed for

21

more than 15 years in the California prison system.

22

unexamined, routine practice effectively erected whites

23

only, blacks only, Hispanics only signs over the portals

24

of the California prison system, and it is a practice

25

which is routed in racial stereotype and the belief that

This

Alderson Reporting Company

1

all persons of a race think alike and act alike.

2

California's needless and dangerous policy fails

3

both the strict scrutiny test, which the Ninth Circuit

4

should have applied, and the Turner deference standard,

5

which the Ninth Circuit wrongly applied.

6
7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Is California the only State,

to your knowledge, to apply this procedure?

8

MR. DEIXLER:

9

The --

10

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the statistics showed

11

that there were -- I'm sorry.

12

fingerprints -- fingertips -- only about 200,000

13

processing incidents a year, 200,000 people a year to be

14

processed.

15

being transferred?

16

I don't have it right at my

I take it that includes some people that are

MR. DEIXLER:

Yes, correct, Your Honor.

In --

17

in the circumstances in this case, Petitioner Johnson, for

18

example, during his 15 years, had been transferred on five

19

separate occasions, and the circumstances which he

20

experienced are not unusual within the California prison

21

system.

22

last three weeks, he's been informed that he's to be

23

transferred yet again within the California prison system

24

to another facility called Corcoran.

25

Indeed, an outside-the-record fact:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

within the

May -- may I put aside for a

Washington, DC 20005

1

moment the question of the strength of your argument in

2

transfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of

3

the original receipt of the prisoner for the first time

4

into the prison system?

5

say California is the only one that -- that makes this

6

racial assignment like this.

7

to guard against an -- an explosive team-up in -- in

8

double-celled prisoners when -- when they're taking them

9

in for the first time?

10

MR. DEIXLER:

What do the other States -- you

What do the other States do

The circumstances in other States,

11

which we've been able to identify, include a range of --

12

of circumstances, which include -- as is available in

13

California under the penal code section, which requires

14

the delivery of a presentence report, together with a

15

commitment order, is analysis on a particularized

16

circumstance basis of the individuals who are coming into

17

the prison and making a -- an estimate as to what may

18

occur.

19

and giving no consideration whatever to race.

20

group of States apparently consider race as part of an

21

overall or holistic bit of analysis with regard to trying

22

to equalize the prison populations.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Other States use a random assignment circumstance,
And a third

Do you know if there are in

24

these other States the same incidents of racial riots or

25

racial killings or racial attacks?

MR. DEIXLER:

Well, the best empirical evidence

2

which exists that we're familiar with was reported in the

3

Trulson study, which the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit

4

petition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the

5

amici have filed with this Court.

6

circumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in Texas,

7

that only five percent of all of the interracial -- of -- of

8

all of the incidents of violence in -- in the Texas prison

9

system were what was described by Professor Trulson as

And in that

10

having racial motivations.

11

one-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial

12

circumstances where there had been interracial cellmates

13

involved in the racial violence.

14

far as anyone has been able to produce in this case in any

15

part of the record, the best empirical data which might

16

respond to your question, Justice Scalia.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And of that five percent, only

And that seems to be, as

Were there any incidents in

18

California's prisons of same cellmates of different races

19

having episodes of violence?

20

So were there incidents like that that led to the

21

development of the policy?

22

MR. DEIXLER:

Or -- this is an old policy.

Justice Ginsburg, one of the

23

interesting things about the record in this case is that

24

the State of California has been unable to identify a

25

single incident of a -- of interracial violence between

5

The record is bereft of that kind of
Rather, they've spoken of information about

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they say that that proves

that their policy is very effective.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. DEIXLER:

I mean, that's --

I think the -- I think the record

8

suggests, as at least in the testimony of Mr. Johnson,

9

that it is a de facto segregation system which exists

10

after the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day

11

period, and so it would be hard for the State of

12

California to provide -- to provide that data.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you were to prevail in

14

this case and a court were to enter a decree forbidding

15

this practice.

16

which one prisoner is seriously injured in a -- in a

17

prison cell because of the interracial assignment policy.

18

Would that be grounds for rethinking the decree?

19

A month later, there is an incident in

MR. DEIXLER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, it seems to

20

me that under the Court's strict scrutiny analysis, which

21

in my judgment should have applied here, and under the

22

particularized circumstance test announced in the Lee case

23

in the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single

24

prisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not

25

to give rise to a systematic change in -- in a policy

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which is rooted in racial stereotype.

2

those prisoners involved in that particular circumstance,

3

of course, some period of -- of segregation would be

4

appropriate as a means of controlling and ensuring that

5

there's not going to be some kind of wholesale racial

6

violence.

7

With regard to

That -JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is -- what is sacrosanct

8

about the -- about the constitutional right not to be

9

subjected to racial stereotype?

There are a lot of other

10

constitutional rights that people in prison give up.

11

That's one of the consequences of committing a crime and

12

being sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional

13

right, the right to -- to walk around and -- and not be

14

seized.

15

constitutional right cannot yield to what prison

16

authorities believe is -- is a useful, not necessarily

17

essential, but a useful means of -- of maintaining order

18

in prison?

19

Why -- why is it that this -- this one

MR. DEIXLER:

Well, Justice Scalia, the

20

fundamental teachings on the Fourteenth Amendment of this

21

Court demonstrate that race is different, that the

22

government use of race is presumed to be unlawful --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

First Amendment rights?

25

conferences.

Oh, it's -- it's different from
Prisoners can't hold news

I mean, there are all sorts of very

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

important constitutional rights that I think are no more

2

important than the Equal Protection Clause which prisoners

3

yield when they're in prison.

4

Now, do we subject the taking away of all of

5

these rights to strict scrutiny when the prison

6

authorities do it?

7

it's -- if it's the judgment of the -- of the prison

8

authorities, we -- we generally defer to it.

9

I don't think so.

MR. DEIXLER:

Yes.

I think we say if

The Turner standard

10

certainly reflects a consideration by this Court that

11

deference is appropriate with regard to rights which are

12

inconsistent with incarceration.

13
14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
rights.

15

MR. DEIXLER:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. DEIXLER:

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19
20
21

Well, even First Amendment

Even First Amendment rights.
Isn't that so?

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
Which is a terribly important

set of rights for individuals, is it not?
MR. DEIXLER:

Yes.

The First Amendment rights

are very important.

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

MR. DEIXLER:

Right.

However, in the context of

24

incarceration, a sacrifice of the right to assembly, the

25

right to correspond in certain circumstances, to contact

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

visits are things which are well within the ambit of what

2

a prison needs to control.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't think so.

I -- why

4

would holding a news conference disrupt a prison?

5

wouldn't.

6

news conferences in prison.

7

You say it's too much trouble.

MR. DEIXLER:

It

We don't want

And in -- and in the circumstances

8

that the Court's test has been announced in Turner, that's

9

certainly within the ambit of a right which the prison

10

authorities might properly exercise.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. DEIXLER:

13
14

And why is this not one?

Well, because this Court

decided -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because it -- it is no -- there

15

is no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the

16

Aryan Brotherhood and -- and Hispanic gangs and -- and

17

black gangs.

18

There's no doubt that that exists.

MR. DEIXLER:

Is it --

There's no doubt -- Justice

19

Scalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in

20

prison, but this policy of California is directed not to

21

the gang aspect of it but to the race aspect.

22

is clear that there's a near zero percent chance that any

23

black person could be housed with any white person, that

24

any white person could be housed with any Hispanic person,

25

without reference to the gang question.

The record

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Deixler, do you think you

lose if we apply Turner?
MR. DEIXLER:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

even under Turner -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, why isn't that the right

8

approach to the case then if that's the -- we don't have

9

to meddle with the rules governing the -- the conduct of

10
11

prisons, if you can prevail under that theory?
MR. DEIXLER:

We would -- we would be pleased to

12

-- to prevail under -- under Turner, Justice Stevens.

13

seems that consistent with the Court's teachings under the

14

Fourteenth Amendment and the most recent considerations by

15

the Court of equal protection and strict scrutiny, that

16

the use of race by California in this context should

17

trigger a strict scrutiny analysis, should lead to an

18

analysis of whether there has been narrow tailoring.

19

under the Turner test, we believe properly applied, the

20

petitioner should prevail as well.

21

It

But

Under the Turner test, it seems that at least

22

two of the four elements which are announced in Turner

23

couldn't possibly be met here.

24

to be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between

25

the government regulation which is at issue and the

announced policy.

2

race alone a violent propensity seems irrational,

3

unreasonable, and contrary to the only empirical evidence

4

which exists, the Trulson study.

5

The notion that one can determine by

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a population

6

in which 50 percent of all the members of a particular

7

race are a member of a -- of a gang, a gang such as we've

8

read about in -- in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera.

9

50 percent are members of the gang.

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

Would that allow you

to segregate?
MR. DEIXLER:

No, I don't think such a

statistic -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is -- is that because you

don't equate race gangs with race animosity?
MR. DEIXLER:

Well, in fact, in part that's

correct, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the -And -- because it does seem to

18

me that part of your submission, or at least an inference

19

that I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute

20

race-based threats.

21

submission?

22

Am I right in saying that that's your

MR. DEIXLER:

Without more, Justice Kennedy,

23

that inference cannot be drawn, and I'll give the Court

24

the example of the Crips and the Bloods --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean the inference that

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- which inference?

2

threat?

3

MR. DEIXLER:

That they are or are not a

That they are not to the extent

4

that, Justice Kennedy, you're asking whether it is an

5

interracial threat.

6

taking the example of the Crips and the Bloods, that they

7

are intra-racial threats, and indeed prison policy directed

8

towards separating Crips and Bloods because of the -- of

9

the intraracial problem is certainly one which would be

10

something that the -- the prison system should address.

11
12

It is -- it is undoubtedly true,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- assume that a gang poses an

interracial threat?

13

MR. DEIXLER:

The -- there's no evidence which

14

has been produced in this record which would suggest that

15

the policy can be tied from skin color to gang membership

16

and from gang membership to interracial violence.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I asked -- I asked about

18

gang membership.

19

interracial threat in any significant number of -- of

20

gangs?

21

Can gang membership be equated with an

Not in the record of this case,

Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- you -- you don't

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to blacks in particular, and you know what the Bloods are.

2

It is a black group that -- that is hostile to whites.

3

And -- and does it take any more than common sense to know

4

that if you put a tattooed member of one group in with a

5

tattooed member of the other group, the likelihood of

6

violence in that cell is going to be greater?

7

more than that needed for -- for the -- for the prison not

8

to cell them together?

9

And is any

Would you acknowledge that at least if the --

10

not just on the basis that one is white and one is black,

11

but if the prison knows that -- that one is a member of

12

the Aryan Brotherhood and the other is a member of the

13

Bloods, the prison can refuse to -- to assign them to the

14

same cell?

15

MR. DEIXLER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

All right.

Now -- now suppose

19

-- I didn't mean to intrude on Justice Breyer, but just

20

following this question, suppose that 50 percent of all

21

the inmate population in a particular small prison is a

member of one of these gangs.

account of race?

24
25

MR. DEIXLER:

Then could you segregate on

I think on race alone, the prison

system would run afoul of the Constitution in making that

determination.

context of gang membership, as part of an overall analysis

3

of proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts

4

existing in that prison, particularized circumstances, as

5

suggested in the Lee case, I think that would be a proper

6

analysis and constitutional.

7

If it -- if race were analyzed in the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's --

Well, would it be a proper

8

analysis simply to -- to separate or not based on gang

9

membership?

10

MR. DEIXLER:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, Justice Souter.
No.

Your answer to Justice

12

Scalia stands on that.

13

argument that gang membership is merely a surrogate for

14

race in that case if that were the policy.

15

MR. DEIXLER:

So you would not be making an

Yes.

In that particular case,

16

gang membership is not a surrogate for race.

17

California policy, race is a surrogate for gang

18

membership.

And you gave one other example, the Eighth

Amendment.

It may be convenient, make things easier for

3

the administration of a prison if prisoners are tortured

every now and then to keep them in line, but obviously,

5

the Eighth Amendment prevails over that.

6

anything else that you say is -- is so fundamental that we

7

don't do it, like torture?

8

segregation belongs in that category.

MR. DEIXLER:

Is there

And -- and you say race

Yes.

Anything else?

Well, in this Court's

10

opinion in the McKune case under a Fifth Amendment

11

analysis, it was found that that didn't -- it was not

analyzed under a Turner standard.

case, before the determination of the liberty right being

procedural due process rights which were exercised in --

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

22

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the Court with an opportunity

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to reaffirm that all government policies based on race are

2

subject to strict scrutiny.

3

to the sound judgment of prison officials does not require

4

this Court to modify its repeated statements that all

5

government action based on race should be subject to

6

strict scrutiny.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The deference generally owed

We say the same about the First

8

Amendment, don't we?

9

speech are subject to strict scrutiny.

10
11

All government actions restricting
Right?

And yet,

we allow that to occur in prison.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think that this Court has

12

recognized in a variety of contexts, including when they

13

have -- when justices have made reference to prison

14

policies, that all government actions based on race are

15

subject to strict scrutiny.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Unlike the First Amendment.

The First Amendment obviously has

18

been subjected, at least when you're talking about things

19

other than outgoing prisoner mail, to be subjected to the

20

Turner analysis, but note -- this Court has never suggested

21

that the Turner analysis applies to race.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Clement, will you tell us

23

how the Government would come out applying the Turner

24

analysis in this case?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

think if the Turner analysis is correctly applied in this

2

case, this policy does not even survive Turner analysis.

3

I would suggest it's very analogous to the marriage policy

4

that the Court struck down in Turner applying the Turner

5

analysis because there the State identified a concern with

6

inmate marriages and particularly with inmate-to-inmate

7

marriages, and yet they adopted a policy that prohibited

8

all inmate marriages.

that strict scrutiny applies.

2

because of the history of this country and the use of --

of race by governments, including in prisons, there is a

concern that all government uses of race must be subjected

to very heightened scrutiny.

there is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving

wrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from

prisons to be segregated on the basis of race.

and the evidence before the Court there -- and this is

clear from the three-judge opinion -- is that the average

stay in the Birmingham city jail was seven to 15 days.

I mean, I think if you look at Brown against Board of

Education itself and you look at the various per curiam

opinions that this Court issued in the wake of Brown v.

just the opposite, that when you integrate, you get less

violence than when you separate.

the prison environment, which is a wholly different

environment than a jail environment.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

stupid question?

May I ask what's probably a

We're concerned, I suppose, about say, a

10

black prisoner who's just coming into prison for the first

11

time and you hope he won't join one of the black gangs.

12

So wouldn't the safest thing to do for the first 20 days

13

is to put him with a cellmate who's not black?

14

MS. GRUNDER:

No, Your Honor, because in prison

15

the animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and

16

that inmate may be subjected --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Between the gangs.

But I'm

18

assuming a new prisoner who you have no information about.

19

Do you presume he's a member of a gang or presume he's

20

somebody who may not be a member of a gang?

21

MS. GRUNDER:

22

person is a member of the gang.

23

presumption --

24
25

There's not a presumption that the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there is a

Well, if he's not a member of

the gang, isn't the danger that he'll become affiliated

with the gang increased by insisting on putting him with

2

the same race as -- as he is?

3

MS. GRUNDER:

That may be, but there is also a

4

danger that if he is housed interracially and subjected to

5

gang pressures on the yard, that he will then be in a

6

situation to go back to his cell, when the door is closed

7

and the lights are out, and commit violent acts upon his

8

cellmate at -- because of pressures that he's receiving

9

from members of his own race.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, you -- you have

11

never -- no evidence that that's ever happened because

12

you've never tried it.

13

MS. GRUNDER:

In the reception centers, no.

The

14

-- it has been a policy of not cross-racially housing the

15

inmates in the cells only.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct, Your Honor.
You -- you said a second ago

17

that there's a significant difference between the

18

conditions in the jails and the conditions in -- in the

19

prisons.

20

organization of -- of racially based gangs in the prisons

21

as distinct from the jails?

22

Is that significant difference the -- the

MS. GRUNDER:

Yes, I think that's true.

And

23

there's also a difference I think in the attitude of -- of

24

the inmates when they're in -- in a state of flux in a

25

jail as opposed to when they arrive to serve their many

years-long sentence, in the case of Mr. Johnson, 37 years

2

to life.

3

things do change.

4

And then I think the reality sets in and -- and
Prison is very different.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Apart from the gang situation,

5

is there reason to think that their minds change in the

6

sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply

7

because they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?

8

MS. GRUNDER:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10
11

Yes, I -- I believe it is.
And do we have any evidence to

that effect?
MS. GRUNDER:

Well, the reality in prison is

12

that people are pressured to join gangs and to -- you

13

either hang with your own or you don't and --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that -- I mean, that goes

15

back to the gang membership situation.

16

that's your strongest argument.

17

MS. GRUNDER:

It seems to me

Yes, it's true.

But even for

18

members -- people who are not actually members of the gang

19

are subjected to the gang pressures.

20

if there was going to be a fight, a planned fight, that

21

was going to break out on a yard, members of a prison gang

22

would tell members of -- of their same race that once the

23

fight breaks out, you better be with us because if you're

24

not, we'll deal with you later.

And that's even for

25

people who aren't gang members.

So the racial pressures

For instance, if --

in prison are very, very severe.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Something --

But it still seems to me that

3

a new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that

4

pressure with the -- his cellmates than with somebody out

5

in the yard.

7

MS. GRUNDER:
but what --

8
9
10

And he may well be, Your Honor,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it seems to me insurance

against him joining a racial gang is cell -- cell him with
somebody who's not of the same race.

11

MS. GRUNDER:

But you -- but to do that would be

12

to invite danger to the -- to the other inmate.

13

the level of interracial violence in prison is high, and

that can't be disregarded.

were to request a cell together, first of all, they would

So there

Ms. Grunder, do you agree

7

with opposing counsel that even if evaluated under the

8

Turner rule, properly applied, that California's policy

9

would not survive?

10

MS. GRUNDER:

I do not agree with counsel.

I

11

believe that the Ninth Circuit did properly apply the

12

Turner standard in this case and that California would

13

pass and does pass the Turner test in this case.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It wouldn't -- it wouldn't pass

15

if -- would it, if we do not accept your argument that

16

California cannot efficiently get records sent along with

17

inmates so that, at the time at least of transfers, the

18

prisons are in a position to know what they're getting?

19

If we -- if we say, look, we're not going to accept the

20

argument from administrative efficiency, then you can't

21

survive Turner, can you?

22

MS. GRUNDER:

Well, it may be more than just

23

administrative efficiency because every prison is

24

different and there are different gang pressures at each

25

prison.

saying, but in fact is that the reason?

MS. GRUNDER:

I think the record is a

Also, they're afraid -- and this is in the

record from the testimony of the officials -- that there

will be a ripple effect and that the interracial violence,

if they were to cell them together, would spill out onto

And also note 13 of the Trulson study indicates that it

16

It would be the -- the second paragraph where

The Turner standard is the appropriate standard

least as the Ninth Circuit applied it.

presume the practice constitutional and the challenger has

the burden to show that if there were no segregation by

race, that violence would not increase.

24

someone go about proving that negative?

25

MS. GRUNDER:

They said that you

Now, how does

Well, in this case the inmate put

1

forth no experts of any kind.

2

for the inmate to rebut the evidence put forth by the

3

prison officials, and -- and there was no evidence

4

submitted.

5

There was an opportunity

So in this case he didn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how would an inmate who

6

was objecting to this racial segregation go about proving

7

such a case?

You said one would have to rely on experts.

8

MS. GRUNDER:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11
12
13

That would be one way, Your Honor.
And so one could put in that

Texas study, but you said that wouldn't be good enough.
MS. GRUNDER:

Well, the Texas study doesn't --

doesn't apply to the initial intake process.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you -- you -- supposing an

14

inmate who would have to call a bevy of experts that he

15

has no wherewithal to -- to pay for -- I mean, you are

16

essentially saying an inmate cannot challenge this policy.

17

MS. GRUNDER:

No, Your Honor.

Actually this

18

policy was applied in a California case after the Johnson

19

case was decided in California to strike down a race-

20

based prison policy.

21

instances when the inmate could --

22

So there -- there certainly are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I asked how would an

say is a very good reason for not applying the Turner

There are many instances in which race needs to

be considered on a day-to-day basis in prison.

12

instance, when the prisoners line up to go to the exercise

13

yard, if 10 white prisoners line up first and the 11th

14

prisoner in line is an African American, it would be

15

extraordinarily ill-advised to release those prisoners in

the manner in which they have lined up to go to yard.

17

would require some reshuffling and maybe even some

shifting of prisoners from yard to yard based on their

3

MS. GRUNDER:

It would be dangerous for the

officer to release the inmates onto the yard in the manner

5

that they had self-arrayed because then you would put 10

6

members or more of one group on the yard and then

7

introduce another member to the yard who was not a member

8

of that group, and that would be very dangerous for the --

the sole person on the yard.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
