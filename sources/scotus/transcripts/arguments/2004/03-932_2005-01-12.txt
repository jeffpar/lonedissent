ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SULLIVAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

We

MR. SULLIVAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents two disparate views of what

12

kind of loss is necessary to sustain a claim for

13

securities fraud under the Reform Act's loss causation

14

requirement.

15

The minority view of artificial inflation

16

articulated by the Ninth Circuit is illogical and equates

17

loss with purchase, regardless of whether the investor has

18

suffered any economic harm.

19

any harm until some form of corrective disclosure occurs

20

and the artificial inflation is removed from the stock.

21

The two events must be related.

22

connection between the harm and the misrepresentation

23

otherwise.

24
25

An investor does not suffer

There is no causal

The majority rule correctly requires a causal
connection between the misrepresentation and a decline in

Washington, DC 20005

1

value.

2

terms of causation that a plaintiff prove that the act of

3

the defendant caused the loss.

4

The -- and the statute itself is expressed in

When we look at the statute of the Reform Act

5

and other provisions, we see supporting language.

6

section 21D of the Reform Act, we see under the provision

7

that has been known as the look-back provision that the

8

Congress discussed the loss in terms of trading price

9

after a corrective disclosure.

10

In

Similarly in section 105 of the Reform Act,

11

although dealing with section 12 of the Securities Act,

12

the Reform Act, in its one place where it actually spoke

13

of loss causation and its definition, defined it in terms

14

of depreciation in value.

15

value of the security would be attributable to the fraud.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the -- the depreciation in

Can -- can you tell me if --

17

if we had not granted certiorari in the case and the Ninth

18

Circuit's opinion became final, what would have happened

19

on remand?

What would have happened in the trial court?

20

MR. SULLIVAN:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At the trial court, the -And -- and wouldn't there have

22

been a -- a motion to make the pleadings more specific and

23

they would have then come up with a measure of damages, or

24

am I wrong about that?

25

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, the Ninth Circuit remanded

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for specific reasons on repleading, which Your Honor has

2

articulated, and those would have occurred.

3

The other issues relating to loss raise

4

questions concerning whether some of the -- the claims

5

might be time barred and whether or not those claims could

6

be stated.

7

So that would have raised a different issue.

In addition, throughout the pleadings of this

8

case -- we're now on the third complaint -- the -- the

9

plaintiffs have not raised that issue and have not sought

10

to plead causation consistent with the -- our view of the

11

world.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, I -- I assume

13

you say that the trial judge and -- and defense counsel

14

and -- and the trial court would have had real problems

15

with this opinion.

What -- what were those problems --

16

MR. SULLIVAN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18
19

Well --- insofar as the measure of

loss is concerned?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, the -- the real problems

20

that the trial court had and what we would continue to

21

espouse with this opinion is that it doesn't link the loss

22

with the misrepresentation.

23

misrepresentation offered occurred 9 months after the

24

price drop that is being sought.

25

And in this case, the

I think when you -- when you carve it all back

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and you look at what the real issue is, at the end of the

2

day, it's -- it becomes an issue of what -- what damages

3

does the plaintiffs' class seek.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under this opinion, how would

5

-- under the Ninth Circuit's opinion, how would the jury

6

have been instructed to come -- to calculate the loss?

7

assume you have a problem with that and I want to know

8

what it is.

9

MR. SULLIVAN:

I

The -- the problem is we wouldn't

10

have been able to -- to frame a clear jury instruction

11

that would have indicated whether or not the loss that the

12

jury should look at would be related to the disclosure

13

about Albuterol Spiros, which would have occurred in the

14

November time frame, or whether we would have had to step

15

back to the February time frame and -- and the loss that

16

was incurred then.

17

related to the -- the damages instructions but would have

18

related to the misrepresentation instruction.

19

And the issue would have not only

And the -- the problem that -- that we continue

20

to have with the -- the case after the Ninth Circuit's

21

opinion is where do you look for the misrepresentation and

22

where do you look for the damage and how do you know that

23

there is a loss under the statute.

24

at a --

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

You're looking at a --

What would have happened if

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company

2

announced revenue shortfalls?

3

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I think that would have

4

been different.

5

to the -- to the drop, and there -- I would expect under

6

pleading that the plaintiffs could have done, they could

7

have tied the two of them together and argued that the

8

cause of the loss was the combination of the two events in

9

the marketplace.

10

That would have been a disclosure prior

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why is it difficult to figure

11

out what the Ninth Circuit was thinking?

12

-- am I right?

I thought they said the -- the seller says

13

we found gold.

The stock sells for $60.

14

of experts who say in the absence of that statement, which

15

was a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10.

16

loss is $50.

17
18
19
20

MR. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that would be the theory

All right.

Now, what's wrong

with that theory?

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

The

under the Ninth Circuit.

MR. SULLIVAN:

24

They have loads

I mean, I take it that's their theory.

21

23

I -- I found it

Well, the -It's clear.

I mean, it's

certainly clear.
MR. SULLIVAN:

The problem with -- with that

theory is that Congress has told us that the

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

misrepresentation has to have caused the loss and --

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

They say it caused the

loss, $50.

4

MR. SULLIVAN:

And -- and what we would be

5

looking for is evidence that -- that such a actual loss

6

occurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the

7

marketplace.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, doesn't it depend on --

on what you -- what you consider to be the value of the

10

stock.

11

find gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?

Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't

12

MR. SULLIVAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, it is.
Because everybody else thinks

14

they found gold too.

15

$60, if worth means its market value.

So you're still holding stock worth

16

MR. SULLIVAN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

That is correct.
And we're dealing with a

18

special rule that looks to market value.

19

don't have to have the -- the representation made

20

explicitly to the plaintiff.

21

was made to the market at large which caused the market

22

value of the stock.

You

It's a representation that

Right?

23

MR. SULLIVAN:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Right?

That is correct.
So he paid $60, he got $60.

There's no loss.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SULLIVAN:

And would have the ability to

2

continue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace

3

until such time as there was a corrective disclosure.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any other problem?

5

I'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the

6

simple theory.

Now, I've heard one that you've ratified.

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. SULLIVAN:

10

And -- and is there any other?
Thank you.

The -- the other is -- is I think an issue of

11

certainty as to the marketplace.

12

operating on a fraud-on-the-market theory context here in

13

this kind of action, and in that -- in that context, when

14

there is a disclosure in the marketplace, you have

15

certainty as to what the market actually valued the

16

decline to be as opposed to speculation that there was in

17

fact inflation at the -- at the time of purchase.

18

Remember, we are

The Ninth Circuit's purchase time rule in the --

19

in the fraud-on-the-market context doesn't necessarily

20

identify the decline in the value of the stock which you

21

can get from the marketplace, and that I think is just

22

better -- a better indicator.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, can we -- can they prove

24

this?

$60.

25

gold.

It turns out that gold never existed and they knew

$50 is wrong, is inflated because of the

2

selling for $200.

3

it.

4

for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have

5

sold for $250.

The stock is not selling for $60 anymore.

All right.

They found platinum.

It's

No one expected

They want to prove maybe it is selling

Can they do it?

6

MR. SULLIVAN:

7

should look for loss, and that --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. SULLIVAN:

The Congress has told us that we

It's a loss.

$250 versus $200.

-- and that leads us to the --

10

the point that -- that whether the increase can actually

11

be pled.

12

the gold component was not part of the -- of the -- the

13

discoveries, and the plaintiffs can indicate that there

14

was an upward tick because of the platinum and a downward

15

movement in the stock because of the disclosure about

16

gold, then I think those two can be separated and pled

17

accordingly.

18

But if there is a disclosure that indicates that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And both would be all right

19

because what's the difference between not getting as much

20

appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct

21

information had been out there and getting less than you

22

would have gotten.

23

is affected the same way.

case.

25

think you're agreeing that in both cases the -- the

I mean, in both cases the shareholder
They didn't get as much in one

So you're not distinguishing between those.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would

2

have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well.

3

That shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't

4

she?

5

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, that shareholder -- it

6

would depend on what has happened in the marketplace.

7

there has not been a disclosure about the absence of gold,

8

that stock would still reflect the -- the value of the

9

expectation of gold.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If

Yes, but I'm assuming that --

11

that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as

12

it would have.

13

But on the point of disclosure, there is a

14

difference between your position and the Government's, and

15

I really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or

16

it's my misperception.

17

disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops.

18

In the Government's presentation -- and I'm reading from

19

page 19 -- the fraud can be revealed by means other than a

20

corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may

21

not be a necessary condition for establishing loss

22

causation in every fraud on the marketplace.

23
24
25

MR. SULLIVAN:

Your view is there's the

Our position is we believe that a

drop in the price is necessary to demonstrate the loss.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But the Government --

It doesn't matter in this case,

Is -- is that issue before us?

6

They do.

In this case -Do we have to decide that issue

here?
MR. SULLIVAN:

We don't have to decide that

issue for this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And is it -- is it easy to

10

prove that -- that the price of this now valuable stock

11

because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had

12

they found gold?

13

plaintiff to prove that -- would -- I mean, if we adopted

14

that theory.

I mean, the burden would be on the

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

The plaintiff has that burden -It would be very hard to prove,

it seems to me.
MR. SULLIVAN:

And -- and at the pleading stage,

19

I believe that they could be segregated and -- and an

20

upward movement in the stock could be distinguished from a

21

downward movement in the stock.

22

in stock would be the focus from our standpoint.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the downward movement

In -- in your view, is the

24

plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or

25

is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of-

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

pocket losses?

2

MR. SULLIVAN:

We don't believe that they are

3

entitled to any expectation damages.

4

of-pocket loss calculation.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would be an out-

Is the -- is the respondents'

6

position properly characterized as asking for expectancy

7

damages or is that too simplistic a view?

8

10

MR. SULLIVAN:
inclusive of expectancy.

I -- I think that it is perhaps
It really depends on how you

view that price inflation theory.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think they'd be called

12

reliance damages.

13

We would call it reliance damages.

14

You know, I used to teach contract law.

MR. SULLIVAN:

And it gets back in our view to

15

the transaction causation distinction in the securities

16

cases that talk about the reliance transaction, price

17

inflation that occurs at the front end.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's so then -- then on

19

the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what

20

would have happened if there had been gold because it

21

might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if

22

there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he

23

only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most,

24

$50.

25

market in the world, it would have been a lot more

But if there had been gold, because of the gold

2

know.

3

strikes me as a difficult question.

4

And you're saying he can't do that?

I don't

Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that

MR. SULLIVAN:

Following your -- your suggestion

5

about the price of gold, it would depend on where that --

6

that disclosure occurred in connection with the price of

7

-- the price of gold, if that disclosure occurred, and if

8

there was an economic loss that could be -- could be tied

9

to it.

The passage of time here is important only insofar

10

as it allows for the corrective disclosure and a chance

11

for the market to reflect an economic loss.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Sullivan, you refer to

13

the disclosure as being the key point and when you measure

14

the -- the loss and so forth.

15

leaks out and there's no specific one disclosure that does

16

it all and the stock gradually declines over a period of

17

six months?

18

MR. SULLIVAN:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20
21

What if the information

I think -How would you handle that

case?
MR. SULLIVAN:

I think that a plaintiff would be

22

able to handle that in -- in a pleading and they would

23

have to identify the leaks and if there are several,

24

identify each of them and identify them as --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, maybe they don't know

the leaks.

2

was a gross false statement at the time they bought the

3

stock and they don't know what happened to the decline.

4

Later on they find out that it gradually leaked out.

5

they have to prove exactly how the information became

6

public?

7

The only thing they can prove is that there

MR. SULLIVAN:

Do

The key is that they have to

8

prove that the loss was connected to the misrepresentation

9

and that the drop in --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they -- they wouldn't

11

have to prove how it came out.

12

prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the

13

market learned the truth.

14

a -- in a column by some market reporter who doesn't

15

disclose how he found out.

16

the truth, isn't that all they need?

17

MR. SULLIVAN:

They would just have to

the answer to your question.

21

Scalia poses about the -- the leak coming out over time

the reason for the misrepresentation, it is in fact

appropriate.

I was distinguishing a

And the -- the question that Justice

The -- the other point that I would like to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

make, in addition to the statutory scheme, is -- is this

2

Court's decision in Basic v. Levinson creates a tension

3

here, and I -- and I think a conflict that is very

4

important to -- to discern.

5

presents the fraud-on-the-market theory, and from that

6

fraud-on-the-market theory we have a rebuttable

7

presumption of reliance for transaction causation.

8
9

The -- Basic v. Levinson

The Ninth Circuit's view collapses the -- the
Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit's view of transaction causation

10

with loss causation and presents a conflict as it relates

11

to that presumption.

12

well- developed, efficient capital market that gets the

13

information out quickly and is easily digestible -- that

14

-- that presumption is at odds with the Reform Act's

15

requirement that there be a burden of proof.

16

collapse the transaction causation and the loss causation,

17

you've got a head-on collision between the rebuttable

18

presumption of reliance and the Congress' codification of

19

the Loss Causation Act and the Reform Act.

20

at the end of the day, the Ninth Circuit's decision really

21

renders that conflict apparent and makes the act of

22

Congress in the Reform Act one that was meaningless.

23

The presumption, which is based on a

If you

And we think,

The -- I think the legislative history is also

24

supportive of our position so far as particularly the

25

Senate report is very important in the -- in the phrase

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

where it talks about the obligation of the plaintiff to

2

prove that the loss in the value of the stock was caused

3

by the section 10(b) violation and not by other factors.

4

That is a critical component here of the analysis and I

5

think very helpful from the standpoint of the legislative

6

history in identifying what we have.

7

Finally, I -- the last point I'd like to make is

8

that the Reform Act from Congress was designed to and

9

sought to establish uniform and fairly stringent pleading

10

guidelines, and this was to address congressional concerns

11

over frivolous suits.

12

Reform Act, was not signaling any intention to relax the

13

requirements of section 10(b), was -- rather, was enacting

14

a very specific loss causation requirement.

15

historically there was a very clear and distinct body of

16

law at the time, the Huddleston case, the Bastian case,

17

and that was codified.

18

perception that Congress was acting and not collapsing the

19

loss causation transaction rule into the loss -- the

20

transaction causation into the loss causation, which I

21

think creates this conflict.

22

And Congress, in enacting the

And

And there was a very clear

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

In a fraud-on-the-market case, a plaintiff who
buys a security at an inflated price suffers no loss at

10

the time of purchase because the market continues to value

11

the security at the inflated price, and that's --

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Would you tell us how you

13

differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and

14

why?

15

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, our view -- well, what ought

16

to happen in this case is that the judgment of the court

17

of appeals should be reversed because the court failed to

18

require loss causation.

19

that transaction causation is sufficient.

20
21

In effect, what the court said is

You agree with the bottom

MR. HUNGAR:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

you our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market

2

case the plaintiff cannot -- has failed to plead loss

3

causation unless the plaintiff pleads that the -- the

4

inflation attributable to the misrepresentation or

5

omission has been removed or reduced from the price of the

6

stock through dissemination of corrective information of

7

some sort to the market.

8

company must make an announcement or that there must be an

9

admission of fraud or that there must be really any

That does not mean that the

10

information, any -- any sort of formal disclosure.

11

the information is disseminated to the market such that

12

the market, in whole or in part, becomes aware of the

13

truth and adjusts the price accordingly, that price

14

adjustment is loss and the plaintiff has alleged loss

15

causation in an amount to be proven at trial.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But if

17

rule 8 governing complaints -- isn't that adequate?

Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Hungar, if you look

rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example,

for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money

fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation

MR. HUNGAR:

that rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not

aware of cases -- the -- the -- one of the amicus briefs

8

cites cases which focus on the nature of the

representation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are

generally fought out because in a -- in a typical

In any event, the difference

between getting the -- the complaint dismissed on the

cases are litigated because it's the difference between

3

spending millions of dollars on discovery, literally

4

millions of dollars on discovery, or not.

5

plaintiff has failed to allege loss causation and for some

reason feels unable to allege it, the -- the case is going

9

means the case is going to go to discovery and the

defendant is going to have to either spend millions of

dollars on their own lawyers or spend millions of dollars

12

to settle even in a case that -- where the plaintiff might

be unable to establish loss causation.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. HUNGAR:

16
17

That's why --

Is -- is the --

-- Congress did what it did in

1995.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is the reason -- is there a

18

further reason that they've got to -- to plead loss

19

causation?

20

-- as making -- as -- as saying that if you were going to

21

recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect

22

have -- have got to prove your loss in a certain way.

23

you're saying if you're going to -- if you're going to sue

24

on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all

25

the elements of fraud on the market.

And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as

And

And if you allege

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to

2

allege exactly what you've just been saying is required.

3

So it's not so the -- I -- I guess what I'm --

4

I'm getting at is maybe what -- maybe the nub of the

5

answer is not necessarily that there's -- that there's

6

fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory

7

as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the

8

basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an

9

element.

10

MR. HUNGAR:

I think that's -- that's a helpful

11

way to look at it, Justice Souter, because it's -- in --

12

in a fraud-on-the-market case, by definition the plaintiff

13

is alleging that there was an efficient national market

14

and that is what makes the difference.

15

-- you -- you buy a gold mine, like the -- the old common

16

law cases that respondents cite, there's no efficient

17

national market on which the -- the plaintiff can turn

18

around and sell it at the same price until the information

19

has been disclosed.

20

active stock market, the market continues to reflect the

21

inflation, and so -- so the plaintiff has not been

22

injured, and the allegation that it was an efficient

23

market and I bought it at an inflated price does not

24

support an inference of -- of injury.

25

because it is a fraud-on-the-market case, that's exactly

If the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by

MR. COUGHLIN:

And -- and I think we did that.

10

We said the stock was inflated and there was damage, and

11

we could have done a better job.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Absolutely --

I thought your theory was, at

13

least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the

14

moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you

15

bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when

16

you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at

17

a later time.

18

MR. COUGHLIN:

That's absolutely correct.

We

19

believe that you suffer your loss and damages on the date

20

you make the purchase.

21

On the day --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can you reconcile that with

22

your concession that if the person who -- who buys it at

23

an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it

24

at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit?

25

would not allow recovery in that situation.

and discovery to connect up how -- how the losses came out

and what you can recover.

21

cannot recover that.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I agree with you that you

You just told us the loss occurs, bang,

MR. COUGHLIN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's -But that's your theory and it

amount you bought it for.

MR. COUGHLIN:

15

They sold it and got fined by the Government because they

heard about the fraud and sold it back into the market to

recoup their losses or back through their broker.

-- that's not okay.

For example, Fannie Mae just publicly, a

1

stock.

2

worth $50, it's inflated by $50.

3

$50 until you show that $50 inflation came out of the

4

stock.

In other words, if you pay $100 for a stock that's

5

You don't recover that

It can come out a number of ways.

Let's say,

6

for example, that somebody announced a competitive

7

product.

8

That would be a market factor that would take some of the

9

inflation out of your false statement that you had a

Well, that would take some of the inflation.

10

product, the AlSpiros product.

11

inflation can come out besides a corrective disclosure.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There are different ways

Yes, but if you've got to show

13

the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of

14

action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss.

15

I mean, if you've got to show the -- the drop following

16

the inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action

17

if there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. COUGHLIN:

conceding that you -- you, in fact, do not have a -- a

2

a loss until the inflation is followed by a drop.

3

there's no drop at the -- at time of purchase plus 1

4

minute, then I don't see how there is even the element of

5

a cause of action.

6

MR. COUGHLIN:

And if

I -- I believe that the day you

7

overpay something, just like in the Sigafus, just in the

8

-- in the Bolles case, both of them had to do with gold

Then you're talking about a

cause of action without damages.

You may not have recoverable

That is true.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you have no damages, you

15

have no cause -- I mean, on normal tort theory, you have

16

no cause of action.

MR. COUGHLIN:

I understand, and I think you

18

have $50 worth of damages right there.

what you have to prove --

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And our concern is

Well, that's exactly what

21

we're debating, I suppose, that very point.

22

it's hard to justify, under this statute, finding a cause

23

of action before there's any damage or if there isn't any.

24

That's -- that's just very hard to understand.

for a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of

17

the lie, at that instant he suffered a loss.

18

listening to you, I now think you're saying -- but I'm not

19

sure because I've heard you say things that are -- both --

different from, say, the Third Circuit.

says we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an

different from a circuit that says you don't have any loss

I don't think I said that that

that's really what the -- what the point is, to fix the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But that's a -That's why the term loss

causation is used because under the statute it's -- it's a

14

loss experienced by the plaintiff caused by the

misrepresentation.

MR. COUGHLIN:

Justice O'Connor, I -- I couldn't

MR. COUGHLIN:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The Government said you don't

want unnecessary discovery.

You have to put out pleadings

24

that make clear what your theory is --

MR. COUGHLIN:

Well -No.

I agree.

It has to be alleged.

There's no doubt.

They don't do well enough in this

case.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but what -- it seems to me

5

that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this.

6

cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by

7

the fraud in question.

8

established by the inflation at the time you purchase.

9

that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow

You

In theory, that limit is
So

10

from that that you have anything to recover for until you

11

have your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on-

Isn't that fair to say?

13

MR. COUGHLIN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. COUGHLIN:

That's fair to say.
Okay.
I agree with that, Your Honor.

That is -- that's exactly what -- that's exactly what

causation and tying it to the actual omissions.

And when we were talking about this

And it follows two sections that deal with

21

pleading, material -- deal with particularized pleading as

22

to falsity and as to scienter.

23

if you don't plead one or two with the particularity

24

required, then the complaint shall be dismissed.

And this statute says that

purchase.

It is just that that is the limit on your loss,

MR. COUGHLIN:
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's the limit on your loss.
But that is not your loss.

11

You're saying now the loss has to occur later when the

12

price goes down and you're thereby harmed.

13

MR. COUGHLIN:

No.

Is that it?

I apologize if I haven't

14

been clear.

15

you cannot recover any portion of the loss until the

16

inflation is taken out.

17

The loss occurs at the time you purchase, but

different way.

The misrepresentation was to the broad market and was

reflected in the broad market price.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Number one, there

Correct.
Number two, you as a purchaser

about the fraud.

MR. COUGHLIN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Correct.
If that is the case, then I

4

don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about

5

your having a cause of action the day after you purchase

before the market has found out and before the fraud is

7

known.

8

-- in an inconsistent theory.

9

I mean, this -- this strikes me as an exercise in

MR. COUGHLIN:

And here's why it matters, if I

10

might, is that what petitioners and perhaps the Government

11

would say is that you're right.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
One point I think I want to focus upon for the

15

-- for the Court is -- is the comment in the Senate report

16

which said that the damages had to be a result of the

17

cause -- the -- the misrepresentation, not other factors.

18

I think what we've just heard about, in terms of the

19

decline in the market value, is -- is a look at a number

20

of the other factors.

21

related to fraud and there are disclosures that are not

related to fraud.
