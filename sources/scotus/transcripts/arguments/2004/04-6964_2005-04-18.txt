CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 04-6964, Jay Shawn Johnson v. California.
Mr. Bedrick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BEDRICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

I would like to address three points.

11

One, the correct prima facie standard under

12

Batson is whether there's sufficient evidence to permit a

13

judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.

14

Two, the challenger's own reasons must be

15

disclosed in order for the Batson process to work and to

16

prevent discrimination.

17

Three, it is improper for a third party to

18

speculate at the prima facie stage as to a challenger's

19

possible reason because what needs to be evaluated is the

20

challenger's own reason and own credibility and own

21

demeanor, and not someone else's guess as a reason.

22

The correct prima facie test is a permissive

23

inference test where there is sufficient evidence to allow

24

a judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.

25

That's equivalent to the test where a judge decides

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

whether there's sufficient evidence to pass a case to the

2

jury, although I'd like to add one small proviso to that,

3

which is in case of doubt, the benefit should go in the

4

direction of obtaining the reason because the goals of

5

Batson cannot properly be enforced unless the reason for

6

the challenge -- the challenge is stated.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

9
10

Well, that's not very That's a very low

standard in the first place, and why should it be watered
down more?

11

MR. BEDRICK:

I'm -- I'm not suggesting it be

12

watered down, Your Honor.

13

a tie, in case the judge finds the question is in

14

equipoise, then there should -- the benefit should go to

15

the -- obtaining the reason and therefore obtaining a -- a

16

ruling on the merits.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm just suggesting in case of

Is the test for going to the

18

jury the same as the test for whether or not discovery can

19

proceed?

20
21
22

MR. BEDRICK:

The test for

going to the jury is actually higher.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

set the bar that high.

24

MR. BEDRICK:

25

No, Your Honor.

Well, I'm -- I'm surprised you

If we're going to -I guess I had the benefit of the

argument before the Court last year and the benefit of

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

further reflection, and I think that allowing the case to

2

go to the jury is a good standard except for my proviso

3

that if it was close and the -- was in equipoise, then the

4

benefit ought to go to obtaining the reason because it is

5

a discovery-type request.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I was just admiring your

7

-- your proposal in that at least it relied on something

8

that the lower courts are used to applying.

9

yes, is there enough to go to the jury?

I mean,

My goodness,

10

it's a standard test.

11

all by saying it isn't quite that because, you know, if

12

it's -- if it's really close, the tie goes to the

13

plaintiff, which is an unusual way for the tie to go.

14

tie usually goes to the other side.

15

MR. BEDRICK:

But you've suddenly destroyed it

The

The tie goes here to -- the

16

standard would be fine with -- with or without the benefit

17

of a tie.

18

I would be happy with the standard either way.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what's the standard

19

under title VII when we talk about that, when we talk

20

about enough evidence to shift the burden of proof?

21

that something less?

22

MR. BEDRICK:

Is

The standard under title VII is

23

something less, Your Honor, because under title VII, under

24

McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff has to prove four

25

factors, that the plaintiff was a member of a protected

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

group, protected minority group; that the plaintiff was

2

qualified for a job and applied; that the plaintiff was

3

rejected; and that the position stayed open.

4

four --

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Those

Well, in -- in Batson, I

6

guess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was

7

basing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas

8

formula.

9

that?

10

Is that right or not?

MR. BEDRICK:

Or have we gone beyond

It's a parallel -- it's based on

11

McDonnell Douglas in the sense that -- that there's a

12

parallel step of prima facie case, shifting the burden of

13

production.

14

answer, and then eventually the trier of fact decides

15

whether or not the -- the plaintiff or the moving party

16

has been persuasive.

17

The defendant or respondent comes up with an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what happens if he

18

doesn't come up with an answer in -- in this case?

19

What -

20

MR. BEDRICK:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have -- what happens if the

22

prosecutor just says, gee, I -- you know -- or the -- the

23

prosecutor has died?

24

a habeas action.

25

You know, it comes up later in -- in

The prosecutor is dead.

MR. BEDRICK:

That's about four questions, Your

1

Honor.

2

If I can take them one at a time.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

It -- it's one hypothesis.

3

There is no answer filed by the State as to what the real

4

reason was.

5

What happens?

MR. BEDRICK:

The trial -- if the State refuses,

6

willfully refuses to present an answer, the trial court

7

could and most likely will, draw an inference from that

8

intentional refusal and hold that inference against the

9

State.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you going to say that if

11

-- if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed to

12

be correct?

13

MR. BEDRICK:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

All right.

So the trial judge

can -- can overrule the challenge.

16
17

No, I'm not saying that.

MR. BEDRICK:

Yes.

The -- if -- if there is

a -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that's quite

19

different from the standard that requires it go to the

20

jury.

21

which the jury could find for the plaintiff.

You send a case to a jury if there's evidence from

22

MR. BEDRICK:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.
And that's -- it -- it seems

24

to me that's a -- that's much more rigorous than the

25

standard that you've proposed in -- in your brief, and

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

that -- and that other courts use in the Batson case.

2

Batson inquiry, as -- as I understand it, is -- is simply

that, an inquiry.

There's a basis to ask the prosecutor

That's all.

5

MR. BEDRICK:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Very much so, Your Honor.
And -- and that's quite

different than sending a case to the jury.

The

MR. BEDRICK:

The -- the standard for -- I

believe the standard we're asking -- that's -- that's why

10

I said the standard of sending the case to the jury but

11

with the benefit of a doubt going to the -- obtaining the

12

reason.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I -- may I go back to your

14

answer to the -- the question whether in the absence of an

15

answer, there is a presumption of a Batson violation, and

16

you said, no, there isn't a presumption -

17

MR. BEDRICK:

18

That is correct.

There is no answer.
MR. BEDRICK:

I misunderstood.

If -- if -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I didn't realize it was a silence issue.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. BEDRICK:

Yes.

If there's a prima facie case and

14

if the prosecutor or the challenger willfully refuses to

15

answer, the trial judge is entitled to draw an inference

16

from that refusal to answer and I believe most likely

17

would draw the inference that there's something wrong here

18

and therefore would find a prima facie case.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

But what I'm

20

getting at is let's assume he doesn't draw that inference.

21

Ultimately at step three, he says, no.

22

reject the challenge.

persuasion has been met.

might lead him to do that, assuming that step one has been

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

three those reasons that the prosecutor has not given, but

9

which he thinks might be good reasons for the challenge

10
11

which do not raise Batson discrimination?
MR. BEDRICK:

We have argued in our brief that

12

it's not correct for the trial judge to speculate as to

13

the prosecutor's possible reasons.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

That's what I'm -

that's what I'm getting at.

it's not appropriate for him to speculate and supply an

don't know what he would be rejecting the challenge for

at that stage, if there is silence on the part of the

government, he's got to find the violation?

I -- I -- the only words that

would differ would be got to.

14

were never raised by the State, and you can't think of any

-- Batson has been the law for 18

In California, we've had Wheeler for 25

Any competent prosecutor who was challenging

10

minority jurors and was faced with a Batson motion would

11

make notes of some kind and keep a record of some kind.

12

If he did not do that, he would not be acting competently

13

and the trial court would be entitled to draw an inference

14

from that claim, refusing to remember.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Bedrick, in your brief

16

you were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressing

17

this question.

18

same litany as title VII, that is, the plaintiff meets a

19

burden which is in title VII very easy to meet -

You said it's just like you go through the

20

MR. BEDRICK:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
-- stage one.

Then the

22

defendant has to come up with a nondiscriminatory reason,

23

and then you find out if that was pretext.

24
25

You kept saying in your brief what you said a
moment ago that you have never seen a case.

You said it

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

never happens.

It never happens that the prosecutor

2

stands silent.

So this is a hypothetical, academic

3

question.

4

suppose it does happen, and I take it that your answer is

5

in that case the person who's raising the Batson challenge

6

wins.

7

I mean, you seem to say -- well, why are you uncertain?

11

But I think you're being pressed to say, well,

Batson test are parallel, but not identical.

find for the plaintiff because under the title VII

formula, which this Court has established in the McDonnell

case entitles the plaintiff to a presumption.

show by a preponderance that -- that the reason was

say, not -- not automatically to punish the employer for

not giving a reason, he loses, which is what you want to

do here.

I thought we've -- we've said to the contrary,

reason and the challenger will always give a reason

because -

JUSTICE BREYER:

What happens in a title VII

case if, in fact, we meet just what Justice Ginsburg said?

14

Can you have a jury trial?

15

Okay?

16

MR. BEDRICK:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Imagine a situation, jury.

Yes.
The plaintiff gets up and

18

establishes the four points.

19

Now, does the judge send it to the jury, or does the judge

20

direct a verdict for the plaintiff?

21
22

MR. BEDRICK:

The defense rests.

I believe in the title VII context

the judge would direct the verdict for the plaintiff.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Defense.

Unusual.

I -

And -- and it seems to me the

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

equate Batson challenges and -- and title VII, and that's

2

because your beginning point is that you base -- you -

3

you require too much of the prima facie case.

4

seems to me all that's required under Batson is reason to

5

inquire.

6

MR. BEDRICK:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

It -- it

Yes.
And that's -- that's a special

use of the term prima facie.
Now, if -- if we want to be consistent with the

10

use of the word -- of the term, prima facie, from Batson

11

to title VII, then it seems to me this inquiry is

12

necessary.

13

motion by setting this rather high threshold that is the

14

same as to go to a jury.

15

But -- and you're the one that puts it in

I disagree with that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I suggest you might have

16

put the high threshold because it's a threshold that

17

judges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to

18

inquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted

19

to demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for

20

when a judge is required to demand a -- what does -- what

21

does reason to inquire mean?

22

standard that -- that can be applied in law?

23

MR. BEDRICK:

Is that a -- is that a

I accept the suggestion from the

Court that the standard could also be reason to inquire.

Number two, if there is silence

three, your position is as follows.
At stage three, number one, there is enough -

12

there is enough evidence on the record from which the

13

judge can find a Batson violation.

14

Number two, there is a state of the evidence

15

from which he is not required to find a Batson violation.

16

Sometimes, maybe most times, the prosecutor's silence will

17

be a reason to find a Batson violation, in addition to

18

those that were stated at stage one.

19

And finally, theoretically -- theoretically even

20

with the prosecutor's silence, the evidence at stage one,

21

sufficient as it might be to get to the jury, will not be

22

persuasive.

23

even with prosecutorial silence, the court will say I

MR. BEDRICK:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.
Okay.

An example -- the only example

that I can think -- the only practical example that I can

5

think of, however, where a trial court is likely not to

draw a strong negative inference from the prosecutor's

failure to answer is in the situation suggested where it

reviews it -- reviewed it on appeal and the prosecutor

9

died.

Under those circumstances, the -- maybe there -

there may be notes in the file, but if there aren't notes

11

in the file, the prosecutor's failure to answer is beyond

I -- I take it in your view

the California standard is more strict than the title VII

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19

Yes, Your Honor, in my view it is.
Well, the California court at

least appears to say it's the same.
MR. BEDRICK:

The -- I believe the California

20

court has misread title VII practice in several ways.

21

believe it has -- it misread what is produced at the -- it

22

has misread what the plaintiff's burden is to produce a

prima facie case.

24

burden is merely, as I stated, to show that a member of a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I ask you a question about

2

the other part of your case, which is that the judge

3

cannot consider in -- in step one anything except the -

4

except the -- the racial strikes and -- and nothing else

5

and cannot even speculate as to what causes might have

6

produced the strikes?

That seems to me rather extreme.

7

MR. BEDRICK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is How can you possibly decide

whether it -- a reasonable juror could find this?

Let's

assume that all three of the -- of the minority, three

MR. BEDRICK:

The judge, the

example, which I respectfully submit would be rather

17

extreme and unusual, the trial judge should still not

19

The reason why the trial judge should not

speculate is shown by the facts of this case.

21

to juror Sara Edwards, the trial judge speculated on two

possibly reasons.

that she had -- was -- did not know whether she could be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As to the second

lenient test that you've established, why isn't it enough

speculation.

Once you have that lenient

I mean, there -- what if all three of the blacks

significant and all three of the blacks are blind and -

can't be that -- that reason that they were stricken.

That doesn't make any sense.

No, Your Honor.

I would agree

And Batson demonstrates

You must show under the totality of the

is it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one

So you -- so you have two -

in California you have two definitions of a prima facie

case, one for Batson and one for all normal tort

litigation.

21

MR. SCHALIT:

In California, we like every other

jurisdiction, as far as I know, probably has two

definitions, just as this Court does.

It sounds like you are in

that it's a tougher standard than normal.

Here you had a

situation, did you not, where there were three black

11

prospective jurors and the prosecutor struck all three?

12

MR. SCHALIT:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
And could that present enough

14

evidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the

fact finder, could find a Batson violation?

16

MR. SCHALIT:

Yes, Your Honor.

A fact finder

could make a -- a conclusion from that, but the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So why is that not enough to

satisfy the standard to require the prosecutor to give an

answer?

that the judge under California law is required to find

that there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable

likelihood, but he must do that without hearing the

prosecutor's reasons.

MR. SCHALIT:

in part on the nature of the interest at issue, and the

particular process that the Court set up in Batson to

create an order -- order -- system of proof and to allow

19

the proper balance to be struck between the importance of

8

there are very few States that have considered this issue.

9

Connecticut, Maryland have done what this Court said it -

10

they should do, what all courts should do and look at the

11

title VII cases.

12

As I mentioned earlier,

California has done that.

It has not announced a standard that is

inconsistent with Batson.

14

that follows from this Court's direction in Batson.

has required a shifting burden of production which does

standard that we believe Batson has identified.

there are certainly Federal courts, such as the Ninth

courts do not do what California believes Batson allows to

be done.

California's standard is contrary to and an unreasonable

application of Batson.

You're arguing that the Ninth

We're arguing, first, the Ninth

Using peremptory challenges to select a fair and unbiased

Of course, in avoiding that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. BEDRICK:

Here the prosecutor perempted all

10

three black jurors and left a black defendant to be tried

11

by an all-white jury in a racially tinged case.

12

facts indisputably present an inference of discrimination.

13

These

The -- my opponent suggests that silence may be

14

a strategic decision.

15

any case where any prosecutor anywhere in a situation

16

remotely like this has chosen silence as the proper

17

strategy.

18

reasons from the prosecutor and then for the trial court

19

to evaluate those reasons and determine whether or not,

20

looking at the -- all the circumstances and the

21

prosecutor's credibility and the type of case, whether or

22

not their challenge is race-based.

23

But we have yet to locate any -

The purpose of Batson is -- is to elicit

Reasons are crucial.

In the appendix to our opening brief, we

24

examined 84 cases in the last couple years where

25

discrimination was found in violation of Batson.

In

51
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

virtually all of these cases, the decision turned on the

2

evaluation of the articulated reason.

3

the articulated reason was unsupported by the record.

4

From that, there was an inference and a finding of

5

discrimination.

6

reason applied to many white jurors who were not

7

challenged.

8
9

In some of those,

In others of those, the articulated

All those facts existed here.

The goals of Batson, which are admirable and
important, which should apply in all 50 States, not just

10

in 48, require -- need the reasons to be elicited because

11

Batson won't work unless reasons are known and examined

12

and ruled on on the merits and a record is made.

13

We'd ask this Court to bring California into the

14

mainstream and ask that reasons be called for in

15

California under the same standard that they're called for

16

everywhere else.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr.

Schalit.

The case is submitted.

21

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
