JUSTICE STEVENS:

We'll now hear argument in the

case of Tenet against John Doe.

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
This case, like the Totten case almost 130 years

11

ago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain

12

additional compensation for services rendered.

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, do you take the position

14

that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision

15

of such an agreement either?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

That's correct.

That's correct,

17

Justice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage

18

arrangements and contracts we're talking about.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, suppose -- suppose

20

somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to -- by the

21

Government to have breached the agreement by writing and

22

publishing a tell-all book about it.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

24

that actually points up the important differences between

25

the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents

2

are alleged to be.

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5
6
7
8
9

Yes, okay.

With respect to espionage

agents -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Would the Government be

without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
MR. CLEMENT:

I believe that's true, Justice

O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign

10

prepublication review agreements.

11

formal security clearances the way that an employee does.

12

And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad

13

swath of classified information that raises attendant

14

counterintelligence concerns.

15

the course of dealing that the agency has with its

16

employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in

17

court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can

18

turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like

19

the prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at

20

issue in this Court's Snepp decision.

21

employment context, I think it's very difficult to say

22

that there's an implied term of the employment contract

23

that either side will not have judicial recourse.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They do not receive

And so if you think about

So in the

But what if the employment

contract is with an American citizen to act as an

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

espionage agent and nobody else knew about it.

2

would that -- would he be treated as an espionage agent or

3

as an employee?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Would --

If I understand your hypothetical,

5

Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated

6

as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a

7

one-off assignment.

8
9

And I think that -- that is illustrated by this
Court's decision in Totten.

I mean, William Lloyd, for

10

example, was a U.S. citizen.

11

Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south.

12

And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr.

13

Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there

14

was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement,

15

and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's

16

contingent fund.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He agreed with President

I -- I'd like your help on

18

this.

19

there is just no actionable contract, or does it say

20

there's no jurisdictions like political question?

21

you win under any of those theories, if we accept them.

22

But which is it?

23

Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean,

Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a

24

difficult question to answer because I think there are a

25

lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision,

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and I think there is --

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but you need to get to

3

whether there is -- do you urge dismissal for lack of

4

jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the

5

merits?

6

It's not clear to me at all.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

7

it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that

8

it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect.

9

referred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a

It's been

10

rule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded

11

us recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use

12

terms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I'm not going

away with a clear idea of your position.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -Do I -- do I -- does the

17

Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction,

18

12(b)(6), no cause of action?

19

do both, but I -- I want to know --

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, you'd probably

Well --- what your best thinking is

22

of what Totten means.

23

that there can be no contract formed under these

24

circumstances.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

It seems to me that this just means

Justice Kennedy, I think the

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

general practice of the Government is to file under both.

2

I believe that's what happened here.

3

that we file under both suggests that there is a little

4

bit of confusion about it.

5

it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under

6

12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision,

7

there's really two strains to the decision.

8
9

I think the fact

I would tend to agree with you

One is a recognition that the claim to relief
necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always

10

regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't

11

proceed.

12

holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action.

13

And that's very analogous to this Court's

There's a second strain to the case, though, and

14

that is that the very idea of walking into court and

15

filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of

16

the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage

17

relationship.

18

that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's

19

better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what

20

you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and

21

they are effectively pleading themselves out of court

22

because as -- if you look at this complaint here, it

23

starts out with a recitation of the fact that these

24

individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and

25

that they were denied certain promises that were made to

And I think particularly if you emphasize

Washington, DC 20005

1

them after they carried out, quote, their end of the

2

bargain.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If there's no cause of action,

4

there's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the

5

closest analogy?

6

which is unenforceable?

7

analogy that we can use?

8
9

Is it like a promise to make a gift,

MR. CLEMENT:

Is there kind of a contract

I -- I mean, I -- you know, one --

one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very

10

rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract.

11

It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize.

12

I think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of

13

these cases, which is there is something inherent in an

14

espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage

15

relationship, you understand that you have no protected

16

status under the law.

17

And

I think that has, with respect, been clear in

18

the -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very

19

beginning of the republic.

20

agreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood

21

that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that

22

was not recognized at the law.

23

has always been thus, and I think there is no reason to

24

revisit the --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I mean, ever since Nathan Hale

And I think that is -- it

Does -- does that mean -- the

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an

2

agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't believe that's true,

4

Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a

5

constitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged

6

agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage

7

relationship.

8

mean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due

9

process claim that anybody could bring if the Government

As I would understand your question, I

tortured them.

secret espionage relationship with the Government and then

12

they tortured me.

13

claim.

14

They wouldn't have to allege that I had a

That would be irrelevant to their

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could I -- could I bring you

15

back to your -- your earlier discussion of a spy who is

16

also a -- a Government employee?

17

he -- he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because

18

the work he was doing was -- was espionage?

19

-- he's a GS-whatever, GS-16, and the Government just

20

doesn't send him his monthly check.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

Are you telling me that

I mean, he's

Well, Justice -He has no recourse for that

check just because he's been doing spy work?
MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's not the position, and

-- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical.

2

be the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who

3

engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then

4

tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that --

5

for that particular endeavor.

6
7
8
9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understood to

Okay, not -- not for his

regular GS salary.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

My -- my hypothetical was

an individual who's not a Government employee but is hired
by the Government to engage in espionage activities.
MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

And as I indicated to

12

you earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not

13

a hypothetical.

14

William Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was

15

employed by President Lincoln to engage in those services.

16

And in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William

17

Lloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the

18

Comptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue

19

to get whatever remedies he had --

20
21
22
23
24
25

That's the Totten decision itself.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
for being a spy.

He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus

Right?

MR. CLEMENT:

That's exactly right.

No bonus

dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you clarify on the

employment question something else?

It's -- it's in your

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of

2

claim with a title VII claim which -- in which you say

3

that the Court in Webster relied on the CIA's historical

4

practice of litigating employment disputes.

5

historical practice, not the Court's rulings.

6

suggesting that even with respect to employment

7

litigation, it's up to the CIA to decide what its practice

8

will be?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

The CIA's
Are you

I don't think so, Justice

10

Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I

11

think that the Government would have had almost no ability

12

to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title

13

VII case is because of its course of dealing with its

14

employees.

15

changed its course of dealing with respect to its

16

employees or entered a very different course of dealing

17

with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might

18

become available in those circumstances.

19

And I suppose that if the agency completely

But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look

20

at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and

21

rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones,

22

that's a very different relationship than the agency has

23

with respect to espionage agents.

24

because they enter contracts with them.

25

certain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit

And again, that's
Each side has

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of a stretch for the Government to come in and say that

2

there's an implied term of that employment agreement that

3

forecloses a judicial remedy.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I -I guess the Government can't

6

enforce -- cannot enforce these contracts either.

7

I mean, you take the good with the -- the bad with the

8

good?

9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Right?

That's exactly right, Justice

Scalia.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

who hasn't carried out his mission?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

You've never sued a spy to --

Certainly not -- I'm not aware of

14

such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's

15

impossible.

16

these agreements, and it does -- it --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think it just reflects the nature of

Can -- can we go back to the

18

-- another threshold question?

19

Judge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in

20

the district court in California, or wherever, is it has

21

to be in the Federal Circuit.

22

against the Government.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

have abandoned it.

25

stage.

You did press below and

This is a contract claim

Are you abandoning that position?
Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we

We abandoned that position at the cert

We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

papers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional

2

objection at this stage.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you free -- are you free

4

to abandon it?

5

its immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the

6

suit is brought in the Federal Circuit -- is that

7

something that you are free -- Congress having said that,

8

that the executive is free to say, well, we could take

9

advantage of that, but we don't want to?

10

Is the -- is the Government's surrender of

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I think the

11

answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in

12

the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our

13

view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court

14

could reach that issue and send the case back on the

15

Tucker Act grounds.

16

it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem,

17

at least at this stage of the litigation.

18

So maybe I could explain to you why

The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a

19

little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two

20

parts to it.

21

of substantive due process claim here that did not depend

22

on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact

23

that there was some endangerment of these individuals and

24

that gave rise to some substantive due process right.

25

even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is

First of all, that there might be some kind

And

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not one that is formed on the contract or an implied

2

contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's

3

clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because

4

it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the

5

individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where

6

they will be endangered.

7

And I think that was certainly true of William

8

Lloyd in the Totten case.

9

he was very much endangered, and that's something that

When he crossed southern lines,

10

wasn't lost on President Lincoln.

11

opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln

12

about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the

13

need for secrecy to protect that.

14

In footnote 3 of our

So that's why I think that claim is properly

15

understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not

16

being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but

17

nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine.

18

The other point they made was with respect to

19

the specific regulations that the agency has internally,

20

and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was

21

based on the regulations independent of the contract.

22

in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would

23

have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations.

24
25

But

And even if the Court is right that there's a
need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the

2

Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there

3

is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually

4

requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized

5

is -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the

6

outset before any discovery because of the nature of the

7

suit.

8
9

So for those two reasons, we thought that the -that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was

10

either not presented because of the substantive due

11

process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the

12

Totten act.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- that would make a lot

14

of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is -- is a

15

dismissal on the merits, just saying there's -- there's no

16

contractual claim.

17

that, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we

18

have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we

19

could resolve all of the questions.

20

I -- I mean, if you didn't believe

But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is

21

based mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said

22

the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be

23

reaching the contract issue.

24

-- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due

25

process claim here and -- and no claim based on the

We should simply say that if

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

regulations.

2
3

How do we get the authority to decide the -- the
contract question?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think whatever the status

5

the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or

6

12(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I

7

think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach

8

that issue at the outset.

9

particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that

And I think it would be

10

when we have a suit that we know on the face of the

11

complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are

12

going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to

13

determine first which court it properly belongs in, when

14

that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified

15

information that we know at the outset the suit should not

16

involve in the first place.

17

flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the

18

Court to reach that threshold question first.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think there is enough

And you're saying that if

20

there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty

21

to protect under the -- under due process procedures.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I think that follows, Justice

23

Kennedy.

24

constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is

25

it gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal

I think one of the difficulties with the

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know

2

there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at

3

all.

4

where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive

5

rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance

6

here that can be brought forward in the courts.

7

And it seems odd that this would develop in a way

I think in this respect it is also important to

8

recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's

9

negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the

10

broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to

11

seek assurances not just about compensation but about how

12

-- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how

13

they're going to get their compensation.

14

there's no particular reason to think procedural

15

assurances should be judicially enforceable when the

16

substantive assurances are not.

17

And I think

Now, one other point to make about the nature of

18

these agreements.

19

agreements does the agency end up in a position where it

20

cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial

21

actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may

22

have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't

23

it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle

2

in -- in any recent development that requires this Court

3

to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests

4

an -- it reflects an understanding that date backs --

5

dates back much further.

6

If I can make one other point, which is I think

7

even though the Totten decision reflects something more

8

than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more

9

fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an

10

espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to

11

compromise secret information, it is true that applying

12

the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear

13

mechanism that protects confidential information.

14

And I would analogize it to this Court's

15

decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive

16

trust arrangement.

17

where -- where an employee who violated a -- a

18

prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the

19

proceeds to the Government.

20

that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court

21

did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there

22

is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these

23

agreements.

24

dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that

25

there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the

I think it is.

It's protected

both by the sources and method provision, and I think

revelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal

prohibitions in the statute as well.

of the intelligence community.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

it, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were

not as flexible as they are today.

21

procedures for matters being kept confidential by courts.

22

We -- we allow hearings that are closed in matters that

23

never would have been done before.

argument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to

If and when it turns out that the prosecution

MR. CLEMENT:

Why not take a --

Well, Justice Scalia, there's a

couple of points to be made about that.
One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in
the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the

10

provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations

11

have been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and

12

handling classified information necessarily involve risks

13

that the information will be disclosed.

14

In the first place, both Totten and the state

15

secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that

16

the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld

17

from the case.

18

is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to

19

the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the

20

case and that's somehow all consistent with the state

21

secrets privilege.

22

is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further

23

disclosure of the information.

24

of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate

25

disclosure to the general public.

It's an absolute privilege.

To the contrary.

So the idea

2

privileged and you take it out of the case.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're not making that

4

statement with respect to anything that's classified.

5

There was something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and

6

19 in which you -- you cite Reynolds and you say the

7

proper response to classified information in civil

8

litigation is to disregard the classified information, not

9

to order partial disclosure to court personnel.

Are --

10

are you saying then in all of civil litigation if

11

information is classified, then it's just out of the case?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I think there

13

can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation

14

where the Government can agree with a party to proceed --

15

as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the

16

basis of classified information, but that would involve a

17

very different way of -- of proceeding than the normal

18

default rules.

19

for the Government to proceed in that way, the default

20

rule in civil litigation has always been that the

21

privilege is just that.

22

23

question.

to them that this has nothing to do with a contract,

totally nothing?

Okay?

But there happen to be some rules

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which

2

we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign

3

person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him

4

something.

5

to do that as a matter of contract.

it at all, but we do it.

7

we want to see that they're following their own rules.

They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is

We have some procedures.

13

confines of the contract.

You go ahead.

I can't imagine a tort that

depends on its very nature on the relationship.

But we're talking about regulations that, as I

understand the other side's allegations, are regulations

for handling secret contracts.

2

that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a

3

secret relationship, there's no point in that individual

even being in a position -- they wouldn't even have

5

standing to challenge the regulation.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So unless one can allege

So -- so you're saying if in

7

fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about

8

regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a

9

contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it

10

has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a

11

way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example,

12

or someone like that.

13

14

It has nothing to do with it, you

Then could they -- what would be the rules then?
MR. CLEMENT:

I still think the answer would be

15

that there would be no relief under that circumstance

16

because their -- their -- still their claim to having any

17

entitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you

18

know, total strangers don't have rights under those

regulations.

20

regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and

asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent

with the entire relationship and the contract that gave

rise to it.

to the district court that if we try to plead around and

base a claim on a contract, the district court should

dismiss that.

MR. BURMAN:

We do not believe that we have to

We have that now as

Do we have to change Totten?

10

Because, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're

11

suing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you

12

win.

13

because you're a spy, if you win.

14

110, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on

15

due process, you win because you're a spy.

16

what, you can't win unless you're a spy.

17

If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win
If you're suing on PL-

So no matter

Now, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it --

20

MR. BURMAN:

And do we have to

I do not believe so, but you should

21

not expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks.

22

And it does not counsel for you to expand Totten when they

23

cannot define a clear line as to where this

24

jurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon

25

here -- they cannot explain to you why in Webster -- they

Washington, DC 20005

1

argued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the

2

same interpretation of Totten that they are arguing now.

3

They specifically said that it should not be up to the

4

courts to look behind the scene of the privilege in

5

Reynolds, and yet the Court rejected that position.

6

In Hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret

7

proceeding with due process and the courts cannot review

8

whether we've made that available, and the Court rejected

9

that.

10

Things have changed since the time of Totten.

11

That does not require overruling Totten, but it certainly

12

does not counsel expanding Totten in the dramatic way that

13

the executive asserts, a way that basically says to the

14

Court you have absolutely no role in determining whether

15

our assertion that the state secret is an essential

16

element here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a

17

state secret.

We -- if there's anything we ought to be able to

19

decide it's what our case is about.

20

used bargain in the complaint, but the district court and

21

the Ninth Circuit have now made it very clear that we

22

cannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due

23

process, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a

24

contract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim.

25

Ninth Circuit has decided all of that against us.

claim.

You have a right to a fair procedure because it's

MR. BURMAN:

That's what we haven't yet had the

8

opportunity to prove as to what it is in these

9

regulations.

But if you would look at -- again, at the

10

respondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that

11

they voluntarily made available, did not make any

12

assertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that

13

this was confidential asked, are there agency regulations

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

points.

12

rebuttal.

Justice Stevens, just a few

13

And may it please the Court, just a few points in

First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's

14

question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process

15

argument.

16

that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked

17

about earlier.

If you look at those footnotes, the only thing

18

Second of all, I think in thinking about this

19

PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think

20

Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim

21

to the CIA.

22

depends on their being a significant difference between

23

coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and

24

I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I

25

am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against

And as I understand their argument, it

the CIA, please hear my claim.

2

material difference in terms of all of the policies that

3

undergird the Totten doctrine between those two.

4

would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a

5

and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents

6

would have to establish a relationship with the agency.

7

I would say there's no

And I

The final two points I would make is, first of

8

all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that

9

they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case.

10
11

I

would make two points about that.
First of all, presumably the reason that William

12

Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it

13

was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't

14

have a concern about retaliation.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. CLEMENT:

I would also say that the

17

difference between suing under Doe and suing under your

18

name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation

19

start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this

20

litigation turns on a secret.

21

revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that

22

just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as

23

in Totten.

24
25

They don't want their name

The last point I would make is they asked you to
take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the

1

litigation, and I would ask you to look at those

2

pleadings.

3

the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites

4

Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times.

5

would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred,

6

then no claim is.

The complaint is replete with references to

7

With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.
