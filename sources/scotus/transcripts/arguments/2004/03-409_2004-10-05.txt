Mr. Machat?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. MACHAT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case concerns whether or not a defendant in

12

a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements

13

of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence

14

of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of

15

that affirmative defense.

16

Now, here are four reasons why that should not

17

be the case.

18

would render the defense useless, because if there is no

19

likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark

20

infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to

21

prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark

22

infringement?

23
24
25

In the first place, if that is the case it

Second -­

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You agree with Judge

Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.
MR. MACHAT:

Yes.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the

2

burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.

3

There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to

4

prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a

5

defendant.

6

the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence

7

of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of

8

a burden.

9

And then, also

there's no reason to prove

You have to prove, first of all -­
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

In this case, did the

10

plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer

11

confusion?

12
13
14

MR. MACHAT:

This was a motion for summary

judgement.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And was there anything in the

15

affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer

16

confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?

17

MR. MACHAT:

Yeah, actually, the record does

18

contain some references to confusion.

19

case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did

20

have some people that actually were confused.

21

that happens, you need to look at what is causing the

22

confusion.

23

The -- in this

And when

And essentially -­

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it might make it

24

necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to

25

avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't

2

any.

3

MR. MACHAT:

Well, but that's shifting the

4

issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of

5

confusion.

6

even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of

7

the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any

8

resulting confusion.

9

However, even if there -- what I'm saying is

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, is it possible that

10

showing consumer confusion could be considered by the

11

court on the issue of what's the fair use?

12

MR. MACHAT:

What's fair?

Well, the thing is, a lot of times

13

when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or

14

the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the

15

confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the

16

fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used

17

descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements

18

are being met.

19

The confusion does not go to the likelihood of

20

confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual

21

elements of the fair-use -­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I'm interested in

23

Justice O'Connor's point.

Suppose it's a close case as to

24

whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only

25

discretion.

With reference to good faith, suppose there's

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly

2

infringing mark.

3

assessment?

4

Does that at least bear on a good-faith

In other words, suppose that it were shown that

5

the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged

6

infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used

7

the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion.

8

Would that -­

9

MR. MACHAT:

Yes -- well, that would show an

10

absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the

11

elements of the fair-use defense.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, so that if you know

13

that there's going to be confusion, there is no good

14

faith?

15

You wouldn't go that far.
MR. MACHAT:

No, I wouldn't go that far.

It's a

16

balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good

17

faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word

18

is, in particular.

19

For instance, if you're using the word "best" -­

20

as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an

21

extremely descriptive word.

22

in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best

23

food," or, you know, "Come to my store.

24

buy."

25

of the risks that -­

So you could go a lot further

I have the best

And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, is it your position

2

that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter

3

how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results?

4

that your position?

5
6
7

MR. MACHAT:

Is

No, I wouldn't go that far, because

you also have to look at the objective use.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I would have thought that

8

consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness;

9

perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the

10

issue of fairness.

11

do they not?

12

Some of the amici take that position,

MR. MACHAT:

Well, I think -- I was reading the

13

amici brief last night.

14

as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at

15

whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not

16

the term is being used as a mark or not.

17

evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a

18

likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the

19

case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the

20

case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair­

21

use defense have been -- have been met.

22

I think the issue of confusion,

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

What did -- what did

23

the district court do here?

24

judgement or deny summary judgement?

25

MR. MACHAT:

The same

Did it grant summary

The -- well, the district court

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense.

2

that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that

3

my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to

4

describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good

5

faith.

The Ninth Circuit -­

6
7

It found

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the district court -- the

district court -- this way --

8

[Laughter.]

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- seemed to focus on the use

10

of the word "micro color," just the word.

11

up what was new in 1999.

12

where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears

13

in a logo-like fashion.

14

district court said you could use "micro color" as you had

15

been using it since 1991.

16

1999 new brochure.

17

It didn't bring

That is, a brochure appears

And as I understand it, the

It didn't refer to the stylized

So -­

MR. MACHAT:

Yes, that is correct.

The district

18

court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that

19

use in 1999.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it might not have been

21

confusion just by using the word.

22

it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.

23

MR. MACHAT:

But when you're using

Well, in the abstract case, it

24

could be.

I would argue, though, in this case it's not,

25

because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure.

2

you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very

3

bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup.

--

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

the question presented here, anyway.

7

to the reason for which we took this case.

8

MR. MACHAT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Well, that wouldn't relate to
It wouldn't relate

Correct.
I mean, maybe the district

10

court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good

11

faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use.

12

understand it, the only question we have before us is

13

whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an

14

exception even when there is confusion.

15

MR. MACHAT:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed

up.

18

side, have to present evidence of no confusion.

I thought that the issue is whether you, on your

19

MR. MACHAT:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. MACHAT:

23

But, as I

Yes, I would agree.

17

22

So

Yes, I think -­
So as far as -­

-- I think we're both saying the

same thing
JUSTICE BREYER:

So as far as Justice O'Connor's

24

question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if

25

they want to go and present evidence that there is

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair,

2

it's ridiculous, they can do it.

3

that?

4

MR. MACHAT:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, do you object to

No, I agree.
No.

So your answer to her

6

question is, of course it could be relevant.

7

other side come in and show that it's relevant.

8

have to show that there is no confusion.

9

MR. MACHAT:

11

Let the
You don't

Absolutely.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's where we are, is that

right?

12

MR. MACHAT:

That's exactly -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. MACHAT:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

-- where we are.
Could you give us a -- I'd be

16

much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily

17

envision a situation where there is confusion but,

18

nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith.

19

clear example.

20

MR. MACHAT:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. MACHAT:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. MACHAT:

25

In my particular case?
No.

Give me a

This -­

I mean, make up one -­

Okay.
-- that's really clear.

Let's use the words "best buy."

Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's,

2

he has the best buy."

3

"Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for

4

the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and

5

he keeps using those words "best buy."

6
7

He wants to advertise on radio,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think there's any

likelihood of confusion there, do you?

8

MR. MACHAT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean -­

Well -­
-- what if he just takes out an

10

ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point?

11

be closer.

12

MR. MACHAT:

That would

Okay, in that case there would be

13

confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best

14

buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore,

15

he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair­

16

use defense.

17

up, it comes up in the case that -­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because a lot of times when confusion comes

I didn't mean to make it that

19

in my hypothetical.

20

at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation

21

point.

22

You're just putting it in bold type

That means it's a trademark?
MR. MACHAT:

Well, it would be evidence that it

23

is a trademark.

You have to -- it depends how big the

24

words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's

25

Electronics."

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, but if you had a

2

-- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great

3

Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you

4

have it in boldfaced print.

5

MR. MACHAT:

I agree, it's not necessarily a

6

trademark.

7

and you have to look at what the person is trying to use

8

to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the

9

products, or, in this case, the store.

10

You have to look at the totality of the ad,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose if you have a sign

11

that says "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P"

12

and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a

13

trademark.

14

MR. MACHAT:

Well -­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Whereas, if you say in a

16

brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then

17

that's okay.

18

Is that the distinction?

MR. MACHAT:

Yes, but I'd go even further and

19

say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n

20

Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not

21

necessarily be a trademark.

22

"Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say

23

that's being a descriptive use.

24

differently in that case.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, if it said, like,

But some people may argue

The Ninth -- the Ninth

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on

2

the trademark-holder to prove confusion.

3

the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to

4

recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the

5

alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause

6

confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive.

7

If you look at

So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we

8

know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is

9

obliged to show likelihood of confusion."

10

MR. MACHAT:

They do it.

But then on -- if you

11

look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion,

12

the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle

13

paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis

14

only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood

15

of customer confusion analysis."

16

Transgo, and they say -- explain that "anyone is free to

17

use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as

18

such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the

19

source of goods."

20

And then they quote from

In effect, what they're doing is, they're

21

expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive

22

words.

23

Essentially what they're saying is -­
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, they go further

24

in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer

25

to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not

2

available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.

3

MR. MACHAT:

Right, and that's -- that's where

4

they're negating what they said in the beginning of their

5

opinion.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

for that proposition.

8

they're right about that.

9
10

MR. MACHAT:

They do have one authority

They cite McCarthy, and I think

Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I

would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is a treatise

12

writer who does take the position that if there's

13

confusion, there's no fair-use defense.

14

MR. MACHAT:

Well, there are other treatise

15

writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position

16

and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if

17

-

18
19
20

even if there is likelihood of confusion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So does the -- what is it -­

the unfair competition restatement?
MR. MACHAT:

Yes, that takes a similar position,

21

as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the

22

same time.

Again, you have to look at what's causing the

23

confusion.

And most often the problem is the confusion is

24

being caused because the person with the words in question

25

is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

If -- there's certain -- there's certain -­

2

there's certain terms and words that Congress has said

3

never get trademark protection.

4

course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never

5

get trademark protection in their primary descriptive

6

sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in

7

their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove

8

secondary meaning.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Descriptive words, of

But I thought we're dealing

10

with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning

11

would be assumed.

12

MR. MACHAT:

Yes.

In the case of an

13

incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed;

14

however, that still does not take away the burden of the

15

holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of

16

confusion.

17

only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the

18

primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question.

19

And, second, the trademark protection attaches

And one other quick example.

The laws say you

20

cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag.

Now, we have

21

12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on

22

their ice cream.

23

will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it."

24

they all have a flag on it.

25

Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion."

There will be confusion there.

Someone
But

That's another example where
Sometimes we

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so

2

business owners are free to describe their goods to

3

consumers.

4
5

And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance
of my time.

MS. MILLETT:

Very well, Mr. Machat.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a

14

case where there might be confusion, but there would still

15

be a fair use.

16

versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on

17

page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that.

18

Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold.

19

This Court's decision in William Warner

You had

And this Court held, as a matter of the common

20

law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair,

21

truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product

22

will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result.

There are other cases cited in the briefs.

The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes

2

its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and

3

that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly,

4

Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to

5

your questions about, what does a fairness component of

6

this test in the statute mean.

7

There is not a general requirement that the -­

8

say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but

9

the non-trademark holder acts fairly.

That's not what

10

Congress said.

11

see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief

12

-- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -­

13

putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the

product.

It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can

That is not some sort of general equitable

That's not a test of how the public reacted.

That focuses on what

How did the

Which is exactly what William Warner,

In common parlance, in a common dictionary

I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does it have a meaning in any

Defendant's

contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of

the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act.

Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that

someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this

7

defense does not apply only to descriptive terms.

In response to

8

Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be

9

available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive

10

marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a

11

mark.

Indeed, our mark here is not --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can you use a fanciful term

13

descriptively?

14

an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean

15

anything.

16

I mean, I think that's the definition of

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, it may mean something in a

different context, I think an example you could use would

be the arbitrary trademark of "Apple" for computers.

19

There could be advertising for Computer Electronics,

20

Incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school

21

rush, using the term "Apple" in a descriptive sense:

22

"Apples for Teachers," you know, the beginning of the

year, "Come to our store."

13

they recognize that this applies to all level of mark.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, but that, all we need to

decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, the Ninth

17

Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive,

18

or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as

19

was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be

20

found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't

21

describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests

22

the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately

23

used when this is applied.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, would you agree, then,

that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non­

trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the

fair-use defense without having to show that there's no

10
11

confusion?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, we believe it's the

12

plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden

13

to show likelihood of confusion.

14

district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence

15

in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment

16

was entered against us because the district court took

17

Petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance

18

whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination

19

of fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall,

20

and that's what needs to be affirmed.

with that formulation because they had taken on the burden

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did you object to the

formulation of the question presented?

infringement require the party asserting the defense to

That's

Now, suppose you establish it,

23

maybe we can find some differences here, would you also

overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

that the confusion, along with possibly other things are

such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word,

3

unfairness, or lack of good faith?

MS. BRINKMANN:

We believe that when Congress -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

You agree with that, or not?

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor, we agree that

7

when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms

8

"used fairly" to refer to the common law, which included

9

not only the common law of technical trademark, but the

10
11

common law of unfair competition.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Good, so now we have something

12

I can disagree with you about.

13

be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show

14

there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or

15

quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome

16

their defense that they put here?

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Now, the question would

Your Honor, the time that those

18

words were used, the common law, and we respectfully

19

disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the

20

reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that.

21

reason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case

22

is because they quite clearly said it did not have a

23

secondary meaning.

24

descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in

25

complete agreement with that.

All right, so now, if we're

3

going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that

4

I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get

5

protection at all, because I was thinking "micro color,"

6

well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny,

teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color.

what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color."

13

So, for an average person, the word "micro

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, what about the word, is

5

it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the

6

word, "micro pigmentation" is used in the trade as a

7

synonym for permanent makeup?

8
9

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, and oftentimes,

trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology.

10

The fact is it is suggestive because "micro colors" is the

11

protected trademark here.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But there is a sense of color

13

in which color is synonymous with pigment.

And I assume

14

that's what was accepted here, which leads me to my

15

question, I don't understand why we're having this

16

discussion.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because I thought it was agreed

that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive

use, is that incorrect?

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of

the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the

23

term differently.

materials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you

3

dispute that there is a descriptive use here?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Is there someplace in the

Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief

5

explains that this purported concession that they discuss

6

about the use of this mark had to do because Justice

7

Ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a

8

bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but

9

assuming they occurred, those were descriptive.

In 1998

10

and 1999, Petitioner started using this on their marketing

brochures in a very different manner.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, this still goes to

the merits of the defense and not to the question

presented.

17

confusion, there is no defense.

that was the only question you were going to discuss here,

not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has

25

the textual language used by the Congress in 1946.

They

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

meant "used fairly" to mean what the common law meant.

2

The common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical

3

trademarks and trade names.

4

Moreover, Petitioner's interpretation is

5

contrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to

6

prevent customer confusion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The whole point is so that

Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you

there, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you

10

must, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down

11

that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show

12

likelihood of confusion.

13

burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the

14

defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

So, if it's the plaintiff's

We don't believe it's the

16

defendant's burden, we believe we -- the district court

17

was correctly reversed by the Ninth Circuit in entering

18

summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that

19

there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion.

20

the district court did that, because as I said it was

21

absolutely irrelevant to the determination of used

22

fairly.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

And

I think this is really

24

quite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann.

The question presented,

25

as several people have pointed out, whether the Lanham

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Act's fair-use defense to trademark infringement requires

2

a party asserting the defense to demonstrate the absence

3

of a likelihood of consumer confusion.

4

Now, do you agree or disagree with that?

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We -­

that, "we agree," or "we don't agree."
MS. BRINKMANN:

We don't agree.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

13

We believe that

likelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense.

10

12

You can surely answer

Okay, okay.

And we would point out that as a

textual argument and the purpose argument
JUSTICE STEVENS:

-

May I ask, may I just

14

interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the

15

defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case,

16

prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of

17

establishing likelihood of confusion.

18

room for the defense at all?

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

So, is there any

As we point out in our brief,

20

Your Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in

21

1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the

22

plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MS. BRINKMANN:

25

-

So the answer is no.

It remains as a Congressional

emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use

35

that is not likely to confuse is allowed.

this was a

4

That is what,

-

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's allowed without the

affirmative defense.

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

To understand why this came in,

6

it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied

7

only to incontestable marks.

8

registered marks.

9

It did not apply to other

At that time, incontestable mark holders did not

10

have to prove likelihood of confusion.

11

12

exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods.

13

14

affidavit with the PTO.

law.

16

That incontestable

Same

That was akin to early common

At that point, the plaintiff could go into court

17

with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive

18

evidence.

19

defendants to be able to say, "Okay, I know this is an

20

incontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it

21

on the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it

22

because I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers

23

with this.

24
25

So there had to be a safety valve for

That's what the purpose was.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In 19

But are you suggesting, I want

to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in,

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark

2

did not have to prove likelihood of confusion?

3
4

MS. BRINKMANN:

It was presumed by the weight of

that, that was the conclusive evidence.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because otherwise, wouldn't

6

that defeat the defense, too, then?

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the way Congress

8

structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except

9

subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the

10

fourth one.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you're saying, isn't

12

your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable

13

presumption?

14

MS. BRINKMANN:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry, yes.

Yes, Your

17

Honor.

18

in 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that

19

they intended to change this and that's what's so

20

fundamental about the position

the Lanham Act.

23

I would also point out that when Congress amended

- the district court

This is a gaping hole in the core purpose of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose IBM had used the

24

word "computers" when they were the only company for ten

25

or fifteen years to mark their product.

Now, another

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

company comes along and they produce the same thing, they

2

want to use the word "computer."

3

would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying that that

Not at all, Your Honor.
People would be confused.

For

6

a while they'll think that "computer" refers to IBM, there

7

would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the

8

product, in fact, at least a very good one.

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, if that were the

10

case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a

11

generic term with no protection.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, at the very beginning,

13

IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it

14

computer, they could have called it a word processor, they

15

could have called it a "think faster."

16

they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they

17

chose the word computer.

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

I don't know what

And Congress took that

19

explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be

20

canceled at any time for genericism.

Escalator, aspirin

21

are all examples of your situation.

That's exactly what

22

happened, and when they came a generic term, that

23

trademark was canceled and it became used as generic.

24

Congress took that into account.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is this fair-use

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion

2

to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?

MS. BRINKMANN:

Since 1988 it's a vestigial

4

reminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was

5

understood in 1946.

6

7

uses that are not likely to confuse.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even for the strongest, incontestable

confusion and the only -- however, there's a special

So if a worst statutory

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought they did when they

23

outlined to us what it means is you're using it

24

descriptively, and not as a mark.

25

-

Makes it a meaningless statute,

20

22

And the words of the

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, those are other

39

1

terms that are used in the statute, those are separate

provision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in

4

good faith, and used fairly.

5

right out of the language.

6

There are four requirements in the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They read "used fairly"

Ms. Brinkmann, am I right

7

that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it

8

as a mark.

9

Because that suggests you're trying to pawn
Are you using it as a mark?

10

Or, are you using it, merely descriptively?

11

as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're

12

not using it in good faith.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

I thought use

No, that is one of the factors

14

in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into

15

account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are

16

confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full

17

of examples of that.

18

I would like to make one other response to

19

Justice Scalia's point, if I could.

Justice Scalia, to

20

the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no

21

longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as

22

unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici

23

that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in

24

any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used

25

fairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

would have it.
We discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example,

3

the Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court

4

to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may well be, but I don't

6

think that's the question presented here.

7

could agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the

8

defense, and still answer the question presented the way

9

that the Petitioner wants.

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

I mean, we

The district court's entry of

11

summary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did

12

that because of its total disregard for likely to

13

confusion -­

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that may be, but the

15

issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too

16

far in the other direction and required too much.

17

we have to determine is whether there is a per se

18

obligation to prove non-confusion.

19

doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's

20

position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too

21

far, isn't that correct?

22

is the issue before us?

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

And all

If we do so, that

I mean, that is what is -- that

I think the ruling from this

24

Court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense

25

against likelihood of confusion.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about if the ruling were

2

a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good

3

faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for

4

infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely.

5

That's what the Restatement that you've just been

6

applauding says.

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, and that discussion

8

explains a couple of things.

It explains that if there is

9

a likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the

10

outer limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use.

It

11

also points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant

12

to that determination that Your Honor just described.

13

Yes, we would win under that position, Your Honor, that's

14

absolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the

15

Restatement

-

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you would win

-

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

You'd still have to vacate

18

the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying

19

that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of

20

it.

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we would

22

actually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in

23

support of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case

24

and the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth

25

Circuit reversing the district court should be affirmed,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also

2

that are not before the Court that should be affirmed.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, you're urging

4

then that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternate

5

grounds.

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

7

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

8

MS. BRINKMANN:

-

We rarely do that.

Yes, Your Honor, I understand

9

that, but in this particular situation

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-

Why wouldn't we just vacate

11

it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't

12

address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate

13

the judgment and send it back?

14

MS. BRINKMANN:

We certainly would agree, Your

15

Honor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand

16

to go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of

17

establishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it

18

held against us.

19

determine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood

20

of confusion, we would suggest that there are other

21

factors that the Restatement puts forth.

22

whether there is commercial justification for the use.

23

Did we point out, there is no commercial justification,

24

there are twenty other competitors that don't use this

25

terminology.

For example, in the middle ground, to

They might have been afraid

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's quite a strong mark, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Brinkmann, am I right

6

that they were, "they" being KP, they were in fact using

7

the word "micro color" before you registered your

8

trademark?

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, we dispute that, Your Honor,

10

they've never produced one bottle from that period.

11

fact, we introduced four bottles of their

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-

But that would be -- that

13

would be a disputed issue of fact.

14

MS. BRINKMANN:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
And are we making any

16

differentiation at all between the mini color red or

17

whatever, and this logo that appears?

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

In

Yes, all the difference in the

19

world, Your Honor.

20

I mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that

21

is one of the issues where you suggested that courts have

22

resolved these on whether something is used as a mark or

23

not, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's

24

always part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion.

25

We maintain that that is a mark use.

That's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that when you go into a store, you can buy the products

2

you want.

3

here, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more

4

money because you know of the quality of them.

5

same time, you want to be assured when you go in, because

6

you don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the

7

time, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for

8

you, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect.

9

encourages the economic efficiency of the market

10

For example, in the health and safety area

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At the

And it
-

Your customers are pretty

11

sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an

12

unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking

13

off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably

14

know this market pretty well.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's directly relevant to the

16

likelihood of confusion, Your Honor.

17

way of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is

18

through consumer survey.

19

survey would not be of the person on the street, it would

20

be of the appropriate purchasers, who are more

21

sophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists.

22

In fact, the typical

And the law is clear that that

But, Your Honor, even on that situation in this

23

record, we have direct evidence of confusion.

It's at

24

joint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration

25

of Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the people who did sales, and she started getting calls

2

from people wanting products, and it confused her because

3

they weren't on my client's customer list, and also they

4

were citing different prices.

5

her at the time, it turns out this was the confusion

6

because they were actually seeing this new usage on the

7

marketing brochure by KP Permanent.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It didn't mean anything to

Just out of curiosity, it has

nothing to do with the case, do they market this product
with color charts, just like paint companies do?
MS. BRINKMANN:

They do, Your Honor, that's

12

absolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the

13

micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because

14

even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely

15

the opposite, it's to hide the color.

16

colors is a critical component of that industry.

17

So mixing of the

I want to make another point about the economic

18

efficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not

19

allowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what

20

Congress intended.

21

they're getting the product that they want, they're a lot,

22

able to be more efficient in the market

By allowing purchasers to know that

prevent that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I guess that's the

question, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt

Your Honor, I don't think

5

there's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the

Lanham Act grossly overstates it.

-- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic

be oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought

up at that point.

21

Also there is an expert agency

And also Congress directly addressed

22

anticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute.

23

It, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust

24

violations.

25

and the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it

It also reinforced the Justice Department,

in and cancel registration.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, no, what I -- the

21

government's position is the same position that, in fact,

22

it urged before Congress in 1946.

23

Park 'n Fly makes this clear.

24

descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary

25

meaning.

The Court's opinion in

And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear,

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and

2

included all of these other safeguards, not allowing

3

registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses

4

that are likely to confuse.

5

We would also point out that that encourages

6

economic efficiencies for businesses as well.

By being

7

able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the

8

business invests more.

9

there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free

As soon as confusion is allowed,

10

riding on that investment.

And it's a disincentive for

11

further investment and it undermines the quality of the

12

goods, because the only way

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Certainly the Restatement and

14

the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on

15

this.

16

MS. BRINKMANN:

We believe that the Restatement

17

and the amici are very consistent in rejecting

18

Petitioner's position and the district court's position

19

that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant.

20

embrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and

21

that would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this

22

Court, because Petitioner's position in the district court

23

wreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that

24

Congress set up and intended.

25

We

We believe as a matter of strict statutory

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision,

2

the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the

3

inconstestability provision.

4

going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses

5

that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to

adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the

7

circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we

8

think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a

9

health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment

But if the Court is not

10

by the mark holder could be relevant.

And to the extent

11

the competitor had a commercial justification for it,

12

because it was a term that everyone needed to use, but

13

"micro colors" is just not that kind of terminology as the

14

record in this case demonstrates.

Thank you, Ms.

Mr. Machat, you have three minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

20

MR. MACHAT:

Thank you.

I'd like to point out

21

that Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history

22

is incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's

23

attention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where

24

basically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were

25

required to find a likelihood of confusion before finding

50

Washington, DC 20005

1

for the plaintiff on a trademark case.

I'd also like to

2

point out that in this particular case, the trademark is

3

not for the word "micro color," the trademark is for the

4

logo mark, and here's some of the confusion.

5

The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark

6

registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the

7

logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the

8

descriptive words within the logo itself.

9

always intended for descriptive words to be free for

And Congress

10

everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so

11

long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using

12

those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense,

13

and that's the distinction.

14

The confusion is only an issue to determine

15

whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is

16

being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from

17

likelihood of confusion.

18

determination, likelihood of confusion is a legal

19

determination.

20

actual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry,

21

the word is being used as a mark.

22

Confusion is a factual

So you can use whether or not there is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I forget your position, if

23

you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion

24

that is predictable or that is likely is one of the

25

elements that can be used to determine whether the use is

51

1

a fair one?

MR. MACHAT:

I would agree, the degree of

confusion, but that comes into whether or not

4
5

Do you agree or disagree with that?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-

All right, that's all I wanted

to know.

6

MR. MACHAT:

In this case, "used fairly" means,

7

it does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to

8

whether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably

9

accurate description of the mark.

And it always -­

10

truthful is something that the common law always looked at

11

to see, that was a term used, in fact, by this Court in

12

the Warner decision, basically, to quote briefly from that

13

decision, it said "the use of a similar name by another to

14

truthfully describe the same product does not constitute

15

a legal or moral wrong."

16

So I would maintain that "used fairly" means

17

truthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly

18

true, reasonably accurate.

19

of "used fairly."

20

intent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use

21

defense.

And that would be the meaning

And of course, good faith refers to the

22

Also, I'd just like to point out once again the

23

Ninth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a,

24

it says, "KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if

25

there is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of

52

1

the term `micro color', and Lasting's mark."

2

they go on to say, "as discussed above, because in this

3

case they can be no fair use --"
