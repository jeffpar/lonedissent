ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Under the decision below, title IX stands alone

11

as the only major civil rights statute that would permit

12

retaliation against those who complain that the law is

13

being violated.

14

discrimination laws that do not contain a separate

15

retaliation provision, and every one of them has been

16

found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of

17

discrimination.

18

There are at least a half a dozen anti

There's a reason for that.

Anti-discrimination

19

laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation

20

are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their

21

institutions into compliance.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, the question is

23

whether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be an

24

administrative remedy.

25

cause of action for damages.

The question here is a private

MR. DELLINGER:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

That is true, Justice Kennedy.
Even -- even assuming the -

the validity of your premise, you still have another step.

4

MR. DELLINGER:

I understand that other step,

5

and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the

6

City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a

7

right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was

8

also administrative remedies available and which was

9

validated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of

10

this Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought -- I thought

12

that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on

13

the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of

14

creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon

15

exemplifies.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

In this case, there is no doubt

17

that the two established principles together that are

18

settled support this cause of action.

19

there is a cause of action to enforce title IX.

20

Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your

21

opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law

22

and, the second point, that the statute itself is

23

violated.

24
25

The first is that
That's

Title IX is violated by retaliatory action
against Coach Jackson.

He's -- and -- and this is an

important part of title IX because, particularly here,

2

people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because

3

students are often minors.

4

position to know the budgets.

5

Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is

6

recognized about the -- about the cause of action for

7

retaliation is that it is very important to enable people

8

to bring their institutions into compliance without

9

resorting to litigation.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They're not in the best
It is people like Coach

It's very -- it's very useful,

11

I'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am

12

sure.

13

things -- especially a coach of a women's team in high

14

school, one of the first things I would do would be to

15

complain about not -- not getting enough facilities.

16

would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether -

17

whether I'm a lousy coach or not.

18

to think twice before you fire me because I would have a

19

retaliation claim.

20
21
22

If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first

MR. DELLINGER:

This

You -- you would have

Justice Scalia, the burden, of

course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation.
And you should take great comfort from the fact,

23

the Court can take great comfort from the fact that

24

retaliation has been established as a violation of all of

25

the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to

MR. DELLINGER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Some of them specifically

That is correct.
Why do they do that if, as you

assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

8

different approach.

9

textual problem.

Well, Congress has taken a

In some cases, there would be a

Title VII, for example, speaks of

10

discrimination based on such individual's race or national

11

origin.

12

specific retaliation provision.

13

about discrimination on the basis of sex.

Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a
Title IX speaks upon -

14

And here I think to -- to allay your concern

15

about the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation

16

provision has been the established law.

17

the time Congress -- it was understood, at the time

18

Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of

19

title VI had been construed by the administrative agency

20

to include a cause of action for retaliation.

21

enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan

22

decision, which had recognized that discrimination can

23

include retaliation.

24
25

It was the law at

Congress

So that it comes as no surprise that every court
of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's retaliation under title IX.

2

there -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the

3

Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation

4

under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other

5

discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly

6

satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and -

7

in -- in dealing with retaliation cases.

8
9

In over 30 years,

Now, here, what the respondent did is they
discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for

10

girls.

11

treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so,

12

because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was

13

discriminating on the basis of sex.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse

Do you think that it -- it is a

15

reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired

16

for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough

17

facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded

18

from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to

19

discrimination under an education program?

20

MR. DELLINGER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

Absolutely.
Do you think that -- that

remotely describes what happened to this coach?
MR. DELLINGER:

Absolutely.

First of all, the

24

-- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition

25

appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated

2

against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX

3

violations.

4

sex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he

5

not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't

6

have lost his position.

He is denied the benefit of

7

coaching in the program.

He's denied the ability to

8

participate in this federally funded program as a coach,

9

and he is discriminated against by being singled out for

10

But for the discrimination on the basis of

retaliation.

11

And this is not a case in which -- that has

12

concern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question

13

about this being a funding case, and I understand the

14

special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that

15

are based upon spending requirements where you want to be

16

sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when

17

they accept the Federal funds.

18

This is not a case in which it could not have

19

been anticipated when those funds were accepted.

20

time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would

21

have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex

22

discrimination was itself, of course, universally known.

23

Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that.

24

We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but that's again the

2

question of the substantive scope of the provision, and

3

that's different from whether there was a congressional

4

intent to create a private cause of action for this sort

5

of violation.

6

forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause

7

of actions anymore.

8

congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a

9

private cause of action for damages.

And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so

You have to show that there's a

MR. DELLINGER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

I think the Court And that's -- that's quite

separate from -

13

MR. DELLINGER:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

I -- I -

-- from this -- from the

15

question of substantive liability.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

I understand that.

Here, first

17

of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when

18

it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was

19

a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting

20

Park that -- that retaliation was considered a part of

21

discrimination.

22

well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim

23

language.

24
25

The title VI regulations were themselves

It provided for retaliation.
And moreover, this Court as recently as the

Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case has found that employment discrimination, sexual

2

harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment

3

all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that

4

Cannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago

5

creates that cause of action.

6

Now, this case is actually a lot easier than

7

Davis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that

8

you and other Justices expressed there, because this is

9

not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for

10

the acts of third parties like students over whom you may

11

have limited control.

12

actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally.

13

It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that

14

peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of

15

discrimination.

16

years by the responsible Federal agency.

17

This is deliberately undertaken

But it's been accepted for more than 30

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it's separate enough

18

from discrimination that in other statutes, although

19

Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination,

20

it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of

21

action for retaliation.

22

if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me

23

that you could clearly say that -- that when the State

24

signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they

25

should have known that this door to litigation was being

That's a

Justice Scalia, with -- with all

6

due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the

7

district accepted these funds, that they could have

8

reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be

9

free to retaliate against people who tried to comply -

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but there was -- there

11

was -- let's go back to this for just a moment -- an

12

administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly

13

under the regs?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16
17

That is correct.
And did this petitioner seek

an administrative remedy at all?
MR. DELLINGER:

He did not seek an

18

administrative remedy.

He went through the school system

19

itself at every level.

He went through five different

20

levels, following the chain of command.

21
22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What would the administrative

remedy have allowed here -

23

MR. DELLINGER:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

MR. DELLINGER:

Well --- had it been sought?

Here, as in Franklin, as in

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in

2

every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in

3

all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with

4

race, you can call this to attention to the office of

5

civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an

6

inquiry.

7

draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the -

Ultimately they have the authority of the

Do they have any other

Because the notion of an administrative remedy

10

ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's

11

complaining.

12

process, this detailed administrative process, leads only

13

to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.

But as I understand it, this administrative

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

That is correct.
So that's it.

It would not

have permitted a restoration of the job to the --

MR. DELLINGER:

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.
-- petitioner.

That is not part of the -- the

20

administrative process is only about institutional

21

funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld

22

the right to bring these actions for what are violations

23

of the statute itself.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if we don't accept -

let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

we're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it

2

is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms.

3

You then made the argument that, in fact, you should

4

recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of

5

-- of school students and so on, if you don't allow

6

retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the

7

whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute

8

is going to be a dead letter.

9

MR. DELLINGER:

10
11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is -So -- so the -- the argument is

you -- you should recognize this as a necessity.

12

That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice

13

O'Connor's question.

14

private cause of action as opposed to the government

15

allowing an administrative remedy?

16

leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply

17

isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact,

18

they don't impose it, or for some other reason.

Why do we have to recognize a

And I thought you were

19

So my question is, is there an argument to say

20

that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough

21

to preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why

22

you've got to have a private cause of action?

23
24
25

MR. DELLINGER:

That -- that is absolutely

right.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's -- what are the facts?

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

What's the empirical evidence for that?

MR. DELLINGER:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well -Do you know if administrative

4

sanctions have been imposed under title IX against

5

schools?

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, I'm sure there have been

7

some instances in which there have been administrative

8

sanctions under title IX.

figures on those, Justice O'Connor.

that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the

ineffective.

MR. DELLINGER:

I do have an answer, first, for

Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger.

The

10

sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting

11

off funds.

12
13

And it -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I can't imagine anyone

who would want such a sanction.

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. DELLINGER:

Which doesn't help -

That is certainly not what --- the girls on the team.

-- Coach -- Coach Jackson would

17

have sought, and -- and because that process is not one

18

that's responsive to the individual case -- if you're down

19

in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office

20

that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a

21

sanction, the fact of the matter is -- and it's the

22

reason -

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you're saying the coach

cares more about it than the Government does?
MR. DELLINGER:

That may well be the case,

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

absolutely.

2

And Coach Jackson -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if -- if the Government

3

is charged with -- with just spending the funds and

4

doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should

5

there be a private cause of action -

6

MR. DELLINGER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because -- when -- when a private

8

cause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than

9

it is to an administrative remedy?

10

MR. DELLINGER:

Because in this case people like

11

Coach Jackson -- it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to

12

come forward.

13

14

possible, then you can't expect the -- the teenagers

15

themselves to carry this burden.

16

If he's not able to -- if he's not

And in fact, it's the reason this Court

17

recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in

18

Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to

19

20

And -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the

necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the

statute because it is a form of discrimination on the

discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing

people from their jobs is what you did when they

There has been one case in which

an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI,

Justice Kennedy.

attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do you take the position that

10

what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the

11

statute as discrimination?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We do, Justice -- Justice

13

O'Connor.

14

because that person has complained about sex

15

discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination

16

within the meaning of title IX.

17

from four considerations, beginning with the Court's

18

decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the

19

Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because

20

he complained about racial discrimination against his

21

lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which

22

only prohibits racial discrimination.

23

backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have

24

understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to

25

afford comparable protection against retaliation.

I'm sorry.

Retaliation against a person

And that conclusion flows

person who is subjected -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Why would Congress then in

3

some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others

4

not?

5

I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

It is, Justice O'Connor, but the

6

explanation for that for -- in title VII, for example, is

7

that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to

8

discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or

9

national origin, and that such individual's language rules

10

out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about

11

here.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It rules out this one, but

13

it doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird

14

kind of retaliation claim.

15

is the person who has been discriminated against complains

16

about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the

17

person who was discriminated against is demoted or not

18

promoted, or whatever.

19

retaliation claim.

20

covered by -- on the basis of that person's sex.

21

Usually the retaliation claim

That's -- that's the classic

And that classic claim is surely

MR. GORNSTEIN:

If -

If it's based on the fact

22

that the -- that the person is complaining about sex

23

discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's

24

exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have

25

here, Justice Scalia.

And that theory of discrimination

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

was recognized in the Sullivan decision.

occurs when there is retaliation against a person because

he's complaining about racial discrimination.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Discrimination

What was the date of the

Sullivan case?

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It was 3 years before Congress

7

enacted section -- I think it was '68 -- '69.

8

'69.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry.

'69.
It was '69, Justice Scalia.
And -- and you think that we

12

take the same approach to implied causes of action today

13

that we took in 1969?

14
15
16
17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

You do not, Justice Scalia, when

you are starting afresh, but JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we certainly did not with

a Spending Clause case.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

19

But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first,

That's true, Justice Kennedy.

20

you operate in the legal context in which Congress was

21

operating at the time, and Congress would have understood

22

-- and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan

23

decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that

24

there was a private right of action and once in deciding

25

that the private right of action included a claim for

damages.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know what case it is,

3

but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that

4

the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before

5

we had set our face against implied causes of action, and

6

therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we

7

used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument.

8

that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of

9

action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were

We said

10

enacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go

11

skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not.

12

And -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Justice Just because Congress in -- in

15

the -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in

16

the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find

17

implied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all

18

these old statutes.

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Let -- let me talk about the

20

cases that I think the principle that you're talking about

21

emerges from.

22

were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and

23

abetters, to the statute.

24

words to this statute.

25

words that are there -

One is the Central Bank case, and what you

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- in light of the relevant

context.

5

But what about Virginia -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about Virginia

Bankshares?

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I'm -- I'm not sure about

7

Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it -- it states a

8

principle.

9

The other case that I was thinking about,

10

Justice Kennedy, is the -- is the Sandoval case.

11

again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private

12

right of action for something that the statute did not

13

itself prohibit.

14

interpret this statute in light of the legal context that

15

Congress had it, which is -

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And

And what we are saying here is,

Well, it -- it's arguable

17

except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against

18

because of his gender.

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.

But this

20

statute does not require discrimination because of such

21

individual's sex.

22
23
24
25

It require -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- exactly like title VII,

but MR. GORNSTEIN:

It's -- it's written exactly not

like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan,

2

which doesn't have a such individual's limitation.

3

-- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination

4

on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of

5

property violates that statute and affords a private right

6

of action to the victim of retaliation.

7

And so too here.

And in

And a person who is victimized

8

by retaliation because that person has been subjected

9

before -- because he complained about sex discrimination

10

is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this

11

statute.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's where you hang.

You

13

-- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX,

14

paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no

15

person in the United States shall on the basis of that

16

person's sex be excluded from participation, you think

17

somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they

18

said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow.

19

have to take out that person's.

20

doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not

21

including the word that person's sex.

22

way to write it:

23

the basis of sex.

24
25

We

I -- I don't -- it

It's a very natural

no person in the United States shall on

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But this is -- it opens it up to

this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

relevant considerations.

2

individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation

3

claim, and it's not here.

4

look at all the other relevant considerations, including

5

Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital

6

importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including

7

the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this

8

provision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have

9

interpreted it to encompass protection against

Inserting the words, such

And so it's -- then you have to

10

retaliation, and including the fact that there's

11

absolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient

12

has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's

13

filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gornstein, what

15

implication would there be, if we took the view of the

16

circuit here, for Federal employment?

17

a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with

18

respect to Federal employees, if I understand.

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Title VII does have

That's correct.

In -- it -- we

20

-- we have taken the position that there is, based on a

21

textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a

22

basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above

23

the use of discrimination.

24

position with respect to the -- to some other statutes.

25

So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and

We have not taken that

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that

2

because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it

3

automatically always picks up retaliation protection.

4

have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis.

5

You

And here, though, all the relevant

6

considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for

7

this kind of protection to further the purposes of the

8

statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this

9

statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that

10

this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to

11

get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending

12

Clause.

13

What the Spending Clause does not require is

14

that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it

15

required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer

16

harassment.

17

and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision,

18

this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important

19

backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and

20

finally the regulations themselves, which specifically

21

forbid retaliation.

22
23
24
25

What it does require, though, is fair notice,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are punitive damages available

under title IX?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

I'm sorry.

Punitive damages

would not be available against a municipality or against a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what -- what do you make

13

of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others

14

have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative

15

remedy in the real world?

16

have never -- there has never been an instance in which

17

funds have been withheld.

18

MR. THOMAS:

It's -- it's -- there -- there

Well, again, Justice Souter, no,

the funds have not been terminated.

20

with you my experiences with dealing with these people.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I can only share

May I ask you with respect to

22

that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to

23

pick and choose because they simply don't have the

24

resources to enforce?

25

go in and investigate?

Now, how often does OCR, in fact,
How many times do they say, well,

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls'

2

basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?

3

MR. THOMAS:

Justice Ginsburg, the only thing

4

that I can say is that on my watch, the number one

5

priority is to keep OCR out.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- so therefore But that wasn't my question.

7

My question is of the universe of complaints that are made

8

under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or

9

isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however

10
11

much it may want to, come in the way you described?
MR. THOMAS:

Well, Your Honor, that was

12

something that was recognized in Cannon.

13

that was cited in several of the footnotes.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I think

And that was the very reason

15

for recognizing a private right of action because the -

16

the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement,

17

would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could

18

enforce it.

19

MR. THOMAS:

But -- but again, stay mindful.

20

Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get

21

admission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and

22

she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on

23

the basis of sex.

24
25

So -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the -- the argument

that's being raised is whether we're talking about the

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

person who is listed in the statute as the primary

2

beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether

3

we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and

4

so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this

5

teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private

6

action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if

7

-- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've

8

either got to recognize this kind of private action or you

9

can forget the whole thing.

That's the argument, and -

10

and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the

11

primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to

12

the point of the argument.

13

MR. THOMAS:

Justice Souter, let me offer this

14

in two ways.

15

words, when -- when you have a scenario about the private

16

cause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents

17

and -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an

18

athletic director at the school.

19

athletics for the whole school system.

20

that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the

21

day, the administration is very conscientious about all of

22

its programs.

23

One, it's not realistic.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

me is -- is not an answer.

25

in her 30's.

In -- in other

We have a director of
And so that -

Well, that's -- to say trust
Cannon is one thing, a woman

a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly

2

situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless

3

you have someone who is best positioned to know what is

4

going on, who is the coach.

5

MR. THOMAS:

But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back

6

to the point who really benefits because -- and especially

7

in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the

8

monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the point is if you

10

say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone

11

because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful

12

incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone

13

and to do something about the discrimination.

14

MR. THOMAS:

Well, but again, though, Justice

15

Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the

16

spending legislation, the school board had a right to know

17

what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance

18

would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was

19

nowhere on the landscape that -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why wasn't it in the

21

regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly -

22

the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to

23

implement this statute, here are our regulations and our

24

regulations are you don't retaliate?

25

MR. THOMAS:

But that's a part of the complaint

and investigatory process.

Now, Justice Ginsburg -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

anything about a private cause of action, did it?

5

MR. THOMAS:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

No, it did not.
And the statute didn't say

anything about a private cause of action.

8

MR. THOMAS:

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

10

The regulations didn't say

It's not on the face.
But the regulation did tell

the school not to retaliate in effect.

11

Tell me, does the record disclose what happened

12

to the petitioner, Jackson?

13

result of all this?

What -- what has been the

Does the record tell us that?

14

MR. THOMAS:

15

16

and obviously, once it was -

No, it does not, Justice O'Connor.

But suppose you go back to the

2

very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's.

3

They pass some civil rights legislation.

4

legislation was passed in the '60's.

5

civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been

6

kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically

7

badly, not because of his race.

8

associating with people who were black.

9

into the restaurant and they both are refused service.

11

Maybe they're beaten up.

Now, under that

He was white, but he was
And they both go

I mean, both of them.

Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit

12

under the -- the civil rights statute?

13

thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can.

Would you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?

I've always

MR. THOMAS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is this a civil rights statute

Justice Breyer, in that context Yes.

Yes, of course.

22

that provides for a private cause of action?

23

to know what the hypothetical is.

with people who are being discriminated against.

7

with your answer.

And now, I

The white person could

I agree

8

And so my question is if that's so and if we

9

have a long history here of the words, on the basis of

10

sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but

11

retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's

12

what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing

13

And to get out my whole question -- there are

14

two parts -- why isn't this the same thing?

15

second part is, because I think it is the same thing -

16

the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is

17

it 1681(a)?

18

MR. THOMAS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the

Yes.
Once we include this in

20

1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then

21

supports the other side.

22

right.

23

It doesn't support you.

All

That's my question.
MR. THOMAS:

Justice Breyer, don't we have to

24

consider at some point in time what the congressional

25

intent was?

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. THOMAS:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, yes.

And again -- and I submit to you So you -- you go ahead.

I'm

4

doing it purely as a matter of logic.

5

civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the

6

basis of your own race.

7

retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit

8

within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's

9

the end of the case.

10

I'm saying the old

History makes clear that

So I would like your response to

that logic.

11

MR. THOMAS:

And I would want to submit to you

12

interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting

13

Rights Act of 1965.

14

Congress.

The whole spectrum of American society is in

15

Congress.

So if Congress is being well represented, when

16

it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a

17

different perspective on it.

18

So everybody now has access to

Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed

19

to some of the citizens of the United States.

20

obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in

21

Sullivan, would make sense.

22

respectfully, that's not the case now.

23

Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face

24

of this statute, it's not there.

there.

So,

If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also
add as a practical consideration -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, you say it's not

4

there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought

5

it was there.

6
7

Isn't that correct?

MR. THOMAS:

But -- but that's an -- an

investigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it's the No, but their reading of the

10

statute was that the word discrimination included a

11

retaliation claim.

12

drafted on the basis of their understanding of what

13

Congress intended by using the word -- the words in this

14

statute.

15

That's the kind of regulations they

MR. THOMAS:

But don't we go -- Justice Stevens,

16

don't we go back to Sandoval?

17

more than what the statute requires?

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can you in a regulation do

You cannot use the regulation

19

that goes beyond the meaning of the statute.

20

that holds.

21

statute itself provides is in a different ball park.

22

that's what I understand these regulations to have done,

23

to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.

24
25

That's what

But a regulation interpreting what the

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -- I mean, Sandoval is

very clear.

clear.

statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than

individuals protected create no implication of an intent

to confer the private right.

same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it.

14

The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here.

15

The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not

the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university

sentence from Sandoval.

into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right

of action, given Cannon, would be inferred.

24
25

I can understand that.

This is about victims.

But I apply the

MR. THOMAS:

Well, Justice Breyer, on the face

3

of the statute, I just can't get there.

4

that, respectfully, but -- but I can't.

5

I apologize for

And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up,

6

interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt

7

v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the

8

Northern District of Birmingham -- for the Northern

9

District of Alabama made very clear that an implied

10

private right of action was not cognizable under title IX,

11

and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it.

12

-- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham,

13

at very least, because the case was affirmed by the

14

Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so

15

anyone who would go -

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And

We -- we can't -- you don't

17

base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial

18

of certiorari -

19

MR. THOMAS:

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

MR. THOMAS:

No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
Thank you.

But -- but to say -- I was trying

22

to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board

23

when it accepted these Federal funds.

24

anticipating that retaliation -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It had no way of

It had never anticipated a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

private right of action, even though it read the Cannon

2

opinion, which was written some 20 years ago?

3

than that.

4

I don't remember.

MR. THOMAS:

Justice Cannon, your opinion there

5

is going to be around for a long time.

6

going to have to debate it for years.

7

Maybe more

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The scholars are

There were some later cases

8

that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply

9

Cannon anymore.

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Congress itself has

adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.

12

MR. THOMAS:

But -- but if I may, but then

13

Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court -

14

in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future

15

should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action

16

absent such specificity on the part of the legislative

17

branch.

18

And that just speaks volumes to me.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said in this statute we

19

do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in

20

the identical way -

21

MR. THOMAS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, ma'am.
-- title VII -- VI

23

proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.

24

So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination,

25

sex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action,

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and that was the holding of this Court.

2

MR. THOMAS:

Yes, ma'am.

Well, but -- but

3

again, it goes -- goes back to -- but would that include

4

retaliation?

5

And -- and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it seems to me that if

6

you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team,

7

realistically the only one who is going to know anything

8

-- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the

9

teacher.

And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it.

10

You have nice words on paper and they'll never be

11

enforced.

12

MR. THOMAS:

But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher

13

could easily, if they don't get a positive response from

14

the administration, they can call OCR.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And OCR says, as it usually

16

does, we're too busy.

17

MR. THOMAS:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

enough money to do the job.

20

Sorry.
No.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They -- no Congress didn't give us

Do we know that?

I mean, do we

21

have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is?

22

Just because they haven't cut off funds -

23

MR. THOMAS:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

I -- I -- they may well not have cut

off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

will hop to it.

2

MR. THOMAS:

Justice Scalia, that's exactly it.

3

I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call,

4

we're supposed to jump.

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. THOMAS:

All the time.

And -- and the other

side of that coin -

9
10

And do they call more than

infrequently?

7
8

It's no doubt about it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is your personal

testimony.

11

MR. THOMAS:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. THOMAS:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, it is.

And -- and Justice There is -- there is much

15

testimony on the other side that says we call and call and

16

they don't come.

17

MR. THOMAS:

Well, I've been in educational law

18

now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school

I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM

11

ON BEHALF OF ALABAMA,

12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

13

MR. NEWSOM:

14
15

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:
I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns

16

that have been raised during the -- the preceding

17

arguments.

18

One is to clarify some things about the scope of

19

the administrative remedy.

20

wants you to think that without the implied right of

21

action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out

22

in the cold.

23

-- it's not just about funding termination.

24

106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems

25

necessary.

The other side, with respect,

That is not true.

The administrative remedy
34 C.F.R.

The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

touted its flexible approach to enforcement which

2

includes, among other things, as this Court noted in

3

Gebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me -

4

decision in North Haven, individualized relief in

5

appropriate circumstances.

6

himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is

7

the threat of -- of funding termination.

8

is wielding the club of funding termination, they can

9

extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate

10
11

So the point, as Senator Bayh

So while the OCR

cases.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do we -- do we have any -- any

12

empirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus

13

leveraged?

14
15
16

MR. NEWSOM:

None that I am aware of, Your -

Your Honor, but JUSTICE SOUTER:

The -- the other side says,

17

look, dead letter.

18

there may be in the letter?

19

What do we know about such life as

MR. NEWSOM:

Well -- well, I will, I assume,

20

perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office

21

to tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done.

22

What I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that

23

the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly

24

encourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things,

25

to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

claimants.

2

this is far from a dead letter.

3

So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you don't concede the

4

point that it is the role of this Court to determine

5

whether agencies are inefficient or not -

6

MR. NEWSOM:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course not.
-- and if they are inefficient

8

to -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill

9

the void?

10

MR. NEWSOM:

Of course not, Justice Scalia, and

11

-- and the Court knows very well from my brief that our

12

position is that when you're talking about implied rights

13

of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading

14

up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts

15

of policy considerations really are not relevant.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If they're not

17

relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides

18

-- do you think it's unlawful?

19

MR. NEWSOM:

20
21

We do not contest the validity of

the regulation.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

If you don't contest the

22

validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think

23

it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?

24

MR. NEWSOM:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
What -- what is it doing?

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. NEWSOM:

It -- section 100.7(e), the

2

regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily

3

concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all

4

-- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes

5

clear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes

6

of official OCR investigations.

7

than that.

8
9

It does not go further

This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it
was -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a

10

statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that

11

statute's implied right of action.

12

Another point I want to make about the

13

administrative remedy.

14

funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if

15

the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been

16

withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that

17

the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in

18

administrative enforcement.

19

Justice Ginsburg asked whether

Another point about administrative enforcement

20

is whether or not there are sufficient resources.

21

obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably

22

the inordinate number of complaints about core,

23

traditional discrimination.

24

made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the

25

petitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on

That,

But as the other side has

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this

2

out in some detail -- there just aren't many of these

3

retaliation claims out there, either in the -- either -

4

either in the judicial system or at OCR.

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

6

MR. NEWSOM:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Why is that, do you think?

Well, my -- I'm sorry.
Is it because no remedy is

8

available, or is it because there are just very few

9

instances giving rise to such?

10

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, I think in all likelihood, it

11

is the latter.

12

would presume -- would not presume ill of local school

13

districts and -- and even State universities, but would

14

presume that they are complying with, if not clearly

15

articulated law, certainly good public policy.

16

Certainly I would think that the Court

The second point is that what the -- the absence

17

of private actions for retaliation shows is that title

18

IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without

19

the implied right of action.

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do we decide this case on the

21

assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a

22

complaint of violation of title IX?

23

MR. NEWSOM:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

Certainly, Your Honor We should decide it on that

assumption?

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. NEWSOM:

You have to take as true, of

2

course, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the

3

complaint.

4

Another point I'd like to make briefly is about

5

the comparison to title VII.

6

look very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's

7

on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's

8

sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact

9

that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation

The other side wants you to

10

in a separate subsection, a separate provision.

11

didn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during

12

the first argument.

13

what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the

14

-- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two

15

models for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses

16

one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to

17

allow Congress to make that choice.

18

here.

19

And I

I had my head in my own book, but

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's what happened

Like the choice it made in

20

1982, very spare statute.

21

it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute

22

in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking

23

resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983.

24

So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would

25

be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation

When Congress got to title IX,

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that came in '64 and '65.

2

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, if -- if I could answer in

3

two parts.

4

in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have

5

Congress in title VII addressing itself both to

6

discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI,

7

passed as part of the same piece of legislation,

8

addressing itself solely to discrimination.

9

Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title

10

First, to say that I think what was going on

And to use

VI model and not the title VII model.

11

Now, to get to your question specifically, I

12

think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question,

13

Sullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with

14

the other side's reliance on Sullivan.

15

due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty

16

opaque.

17

lights a principle that every anti-discrimination

18

provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary -

19

First, with all

It certainly does not announce with flashing

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It says if you're thrown out

20

of the club because you champion the rights of a black

21

man, you have a right to sue under this statute.

22

MR. NEWSOM:

Even if I were to grant your

23

assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I

24

presume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of

25

scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court

48
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was trying to do.

2

1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction

3

does not necessarily carry over to every anti

4

discrimination provision.

5

language to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is

6

passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth

7

Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable -

8
9

But even granting your assumption, if

JUSTICE STEVENS:

1982, of course, uses different

Yes, but it did construe the

word discrimination, didn't it?

10

MR. NEWSOM:

No, sir.

Discrimination is not

11

even in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982.

12

the language is very different -

13
14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

On account of race is in it.

Right?
MR. NEWSOM:

I'll have to confess I don't -- it

16

does say something like every person shall have the same

17

right as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons.

18

-- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more

19

fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if

20

that's true for -- for that statute passed under that

21

constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice

22

Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument

23

about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that

24

conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express,

25

and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would

have gotten its clear notice in this case.

imagine -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare,

5

We better look at the regulations to find

MR. NEWSOM:

I agree, and -- and if -- and if

10

the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the

11

regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation

12

not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but

13

instead that -- that manages the internal operating

14

procedures for official agency investigations.

15

sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not

16

retaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR

17

investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to

18

administrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on

19

notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-

20

retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it

21

violated any such nonexistent -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So to be

23

about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves.

must you do to comply?

I mean, they must have

And -- and with respect, I think

7

there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice

8

requirements that this Court has -- has used in Spending

9

Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR

11

investigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I really don't get that.

12

If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate,

13

that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be

14

on our checklist.

15

retaliate.

But the substantive rule is don't

MR. NEWSOM:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

MR. NEWSOM:

Justice Stevens, may I respond?
Yes.

Even granting your assumption,

19

Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the

20

-- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- to

21

a private right of action for damages and fees even in -

22

in the event that there were some generally applicable

23

anti-retaliation provision.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. DELLINGER:

I should make it clear that

6

we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause

7

of action.

8

of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v.

9

the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress.

We're asking the Court to interpret the cause

10

It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval.

11

when you look at the scope of that -- of that prohibition,

12

that cause of action, why would it not extend to

13

retaliation?

14
15

The idea that you --

separately.

16

18

And

I understand.
Other statutes don't view the

one as -- as being incorporated in the other.
MR. DELLINGER:

The practice of Congress has not

20

been consistent on incorporating express provisions

21

sometimes because of language differences, but there are

22

half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have

23

consistently assumed included retaliation as part of

24

discrimination.

25

1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the

Section 1981, section 1982, title VI,

1

Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way.

2

And why would they not?

The notion that you

3

have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of

4

Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her

5

on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and

6

expel her for complaining about your admissions policy

7

makes no sense.

9

In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what
any administration might do about enforcement is not

10

necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this

11

Court's decision in Cannon.

12

frankly -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it's reaffirmed it

There are no vagaries in

14

private enforcement.

15

in the interest of the whole polity.

16

vagaries there.

17

Private attorneys general always act

MR. DELLINGER:

There are no

Well, in this case, it has been

18

known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to

19

bring them about by allowing people to step forward.

20

last point they make is that even if there's a cause of

21

action, and even if the cause of action covers

22

retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because

23

he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination.

24

That makes no sense in law or in logic.

25

The

If the captain of the boys' basketball team

joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a

2

supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls'

3

basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended

4

from their teams or dropped from the honor society in

5

retaliation, it makes no sense.

6

they've both been discriminated against on the basis of

7

sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination

8

or neither is.

9

Either they both have -

And in this case, it's going to be critically

10

important that this valuable statute, which has meant so

11

much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to

12

have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that

13

they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow

14

them to come forward within the school itself and try to

15

rectify these anomalies in and under title IX.
