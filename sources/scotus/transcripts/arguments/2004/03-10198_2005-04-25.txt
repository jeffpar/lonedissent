CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Moran.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether, 42 years

11

after this Court decided in Douglas v. California that

12

indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of

13

counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal -

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, now, Douglas didn't

involve a guilty plea, I guess.
MR. MORAN:

It did not, Your Honor.

It was a

trial case.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And did the Court say

19

anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea?

20

I guess it didn't.

21

MR. MORAN:

It did not.

None of this Court's

22

cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the

23

conviction was by trial or by plea.

24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Does that make a difference

or could it?

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

I don't believe it does, Your Honor,

2

because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of

3

difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea.

4

Of course, certain issues are waived.

5

waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other

6

issues remain.

7

especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well

8

knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines -

9

very complicated issues of sentencing law arise.

Trial issues are

And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates,

And now

10

Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps

11

more complicated than the Federal system that's been in

12

effect since the 1980's.

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Did -- did your client waive

14

any right to appeal here in connection with the

15

proceedings of the plea?

16
17

MR. MORAN:

He did not waive a right to file an

application for leave to appeal.

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19

MR. MORAN:

Because of the -

What did he waive?

He waived the right to have a -- to

20

have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in

21

other words, the right to automatically have full briefing

22

and oral argument.

23

to go through the application for leave to appeal

24

procedure which involves a preliminary determination of

25

merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.

So what he agreed to by pleading was

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why didn't he waive the right

2

to have counsel for that -- for that purpose since that

3

was the law in Michigan?

4

MR. MORAN:

5

a matter of fact, he did not.

6

point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving

7

up his right to counsel.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MORAN:

Well, he was told what -- what

He was told that under certain

circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. MORAN:

14

He was never told at any

right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.

10
11

Well, he did not -- first of all, as

Right.

But the judge never said, under any

other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, isn't that a

16

perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and

17

B, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will not

18

be given?

19

MR. MORAN:

It might be a natural inference for

20

somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert

21

is a special education student, functionally illiterate.

22

And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his

23

right to counsel.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, did we take this case on

the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

take the case on the ground that even if he were advised,

2

he'd still have his right?

3

MR. MORAN:

I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy,

4

because this is a case in which the State is making a

5

waiver argument.

6

not part of -- is not the intent of the statute.

7

statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant

8

should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't

9

be getting counsel.

10

And, of course, the waiver argument is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What the

Well, I -- I take it you would

11

challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were

12

advised?

13

MR. MORAN:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

Absolutely.
And even if he said, I hereby

waive?

16

MR. MORAN:

Absolutely, we would because that is

17

a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor.

18

That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money

19

because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible

20

for appointed counsel on appeal.

21

effect whatsoever on -

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that waiver has no

Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm

sorry.
MR. MORAN:

It would have no effect whatsoever

on money defendants I'm saying.

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wouldn't your position be

2

different if he had been advised that he had exactly the

3

right that you claim he has, and the court said, however,

4

in Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless you

5

waive that right?

6

right, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'll

7

have a trial.

8

that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?

9

If -- if you don't want to waive that

Would -- would your answer still be that -

MR. MORAN:

The waiver would be unconstitutional

10

under those conditions because it is a discriminatory

11

waiver.

To show how breathtaking the State's argument -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How -- why is that prejudicial

13

to him?

14

did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.

He says, okay, I can't plead guilty.

15

MR. MORAN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

trial?

I really

I'm sorry.
Why doesn't he just have a

He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.

18

MR. MORAN:

Well, as this Court has long

19

recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit.

20

mean, excuse me.

21

benefits.

22

would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits

23

of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors

24

corrected.

25

I

A guilty plea provides very substantial

And so the effect of the Michigan statute then

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, is that what you were going

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's -

2

that it's far-reaching.

3

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

Well, not only that, if the

4

State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the

5

State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free

6

transcripts.

7

fees.

8

you can't have counsel at sentencing.

You can't have the waiver of the filing

In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

These are all disparate impact

10

arguments.

11

argument that the State intentionally discriminates

12

against the poor.

13

is harder on the poor than it is on the rich.

14

thought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have

15

said that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as

16

far as equal protection is concerned.

17

There's -- there's -- you're not making any

You're just saying the effect of this

MR. MORAN:

But I

Well, Justice Scalia, I actually

18

have two responses to that.

19

aimed at the poor.

20

-- in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent.

21

It refers to the indigent.

22

its face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent

23

and only the indigent to have -- have an attorney.

24

don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact

25

case.

First, this is intentionally

Looking at 770.3a, the statute under

So this is a statute that on

So I

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But in the context of appellate counsel for a

2

first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- have

3

not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has

4

applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear

5

most recently in the MLB case -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In any event, you pointed out

7

that on the face there is the distinction on the face of

8

it -

9

MR. MORAN:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

impact case at all -

12

MR. MORAN:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

-- it is not a disparate

Yes.
-- because it affects only

indigents.

15

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

There is no question that this

16

statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to

17

the indigent.

18

the wealthy, and it's aimed at the -- at the indigent

19

only.

20

It has -- it has no impact whatsoever on

So I do -- I do not agree that this JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whenever a State has -- has

21

initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it

22

cuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is

23

denying equal protection to the poor?

24

to be an extraordinary proposition.

25

picking on the poor.

That -- that seems

The State isn't

It's just saying that -- that the -

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past

2

we're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one

3

instance of guilty pleas.

4

is intentional discrimination against the poor?

5

MR. MORAN:

And -- and you say that -- that

It's not a -- a disparate impact

6

claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the

7

poor.

8

the poor and only from the poor.

9

The statute was designed to take away counsel from

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So any cutback on benefits that

10

is given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is

11

intentional discrimination against the poor.

12

MR. MORAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.
Just this one because that's

your case.

15

MR. MORAN:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This case certainly is.
You're saying this is case

17

like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free

18

transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.

19

MR. MORAN:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. MORAN:

Yes.
You're bracketing -

This case -- in many ways the

22

restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to

23

appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse

24

than those that were struck down in Douglas because at

25

least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues.

2

We don't even have that here.

3

All we have here is the indigent forced to shift

4

for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are

5

any issues, forced to order his own transcript.

6

Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to

7

obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts,

8

his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents

9

necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily

10
11

be done by counsel.

Under the

And so -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just understand one

12

point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me?

13

your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent

14

for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was

15

there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?

16

MR. MORAN:

In

Oh, it's my -- it's certainly my

17

contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to

18

afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-

19

tier direct felony appeal on the merits.

20
21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that ultimately your case

rests not on equal protection but due process.
MR. MORAN:

It's a merger of both principles, as

this Court said JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's one as much as the

other, isn't it?

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MORAN:

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
I mean, you're -- we're saying

3

if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one

4

incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've

5

got to provide counsel.

6

MR. MORAN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Justice Souter.
So you're -- you're retracting

8

the pure equal protection claim?

9

to do that.

I don't think you want

I mean, you would say that even if there were

10

not a due process right, you would still regard this as -

11

as directed against the poor.

12

MR. MORAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. MORAN:

It is directed Or not?

It is directed against the poor,

15

which is why there is an equal protection component to

16

this argument, but this Court's cases -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say that component

18

wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right

19

to have counsel on appeal.

20

MR. MORAN:

I believe that's right.

It's -

21

it's difficult -- I have to confess, Your Honor, it's

22

difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and

23

equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line,

24

and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a

25

certain merger.

Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the

2

lines in these cases.

3

But -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're -- you're saying that

4

the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of

5

merely providing counsel as a matter of grace.

6

what due process does for you.

7

provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have

8

a very clear equal protection case which you would not

9

otherwise have.

10

Because they have to

Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work

together?

11
12

That's

MR. MORAN:
Souter.

I think that's right, Justice

I think I agree with that.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can -- in your view, can the

14

State require a waiver of the right to appeal for

15

everyone?

16

MR. MORAN:

That's a question this Court hasn't

17

decided, and I don't have a position on that.

18

far different from this case because that would not be

19

discriminatory.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's

Well, I'm not so sure.

It

21

certainly goes to the importance or the significance of

22

the underlying right.

23

if I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require

24

waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of

25

the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence

My understanding is -- correct me

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is calculated, as I understand it.

2

MR. MORAN:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Yes.
And do you question the

lawfulness of that?

5

MR. MORAN:

I don't.

And that -- that case has

6

not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how

7

this Court would decide that case if it comes.

8

some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate

9

waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea.

10

I know

One thing the Michigan statute is -- does is it

11

takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents

12

without negotiation.

13

It's -- it's the baseline.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're

14

-- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due

15

process claim and if it is not a violation of due process

16

to require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive

17

entirely the right to appeal.

18

right to counsel on appeal.

19

due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.

20

MR. MORAN:

Surely you can waive the
If that's not a violation of

But, Your Honor, the problem is -

21

is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a

22

forced waiver on only the poor.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's an equal protection

claim.
MR. MORAN:

That's an equal protection claim.

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you've -- you've said your

2

equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim.

3

If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver,

4

then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to

5

whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur,

6

there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal

7

protection claim.

8
9

MR. MORAN:

I'm really not sure that you can

separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment

10

again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know

11

this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there

12

is -- there is a component of both.

13

because of these sorts of questions that I think you have

14

to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the

15

Griffin/Douglas line.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

waiver, but the JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

that was waived.

Let them JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm missing something on

13

right to have a counsel on appeal.

14

He can waive a jury trial.

15

he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional

16

right to a jury trial.

17

MR. MORAN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

He can waive a trial.

But before he has to -- before

That's right.
And why wouldn't he also have

to have the -- to know that he has the constitutional

right, fine.

That's all.

That's right.
So what's all this complicated

thing about?
MR. MORAN:

If an indigent, after being

11

sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to

12

go on appeal by myself, which is actually a -- a right

13

this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to

14

represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent

15

is allowed to -- would be allowed to represent himself or

16

herself on appeal if they chose to do so.

17

here is that the statute purports to take away the right,

18

and it's our position that this is a -

19
20

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But

Well, Mr. Moran, here on page

22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the

17

defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea,

18

you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of

right.

Okay.

But it's a -- it's -- what Michigan

so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by

Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not

how the -- the Michigan Court of Appeals works.

Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.

And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of

MR. MORAN:

It's People v. Berry?
That was a decision of the

applications for saying -- by saying, we are not persuaded

that we should hear the questions presented.

The Michigan Supreme Court denies the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why wouldn't it be the

14

same if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the

15

intermediate appellate level?

16

MR. MORAN:

Because the Michigan Court of

17

Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-

18

correcting court.

19

for lack of merit.

20

dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said,

without exception, that is a decision on the merits that

22

precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Didn't it say that the -- that

the intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a

4

MR. MORAN:

It called it a discretionary appeal,

5

Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the -

6

the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of

7

Appeals is an error-correcting court.

8

very author of the -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. MORAN:

And in fact, the

That was a dissent, though.

That's right, but the very author of

11

the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year

12

later or 2 years later describes the effect of -- of an

13

order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of

14

Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and

15

rejected the merits.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, in effect, it's

17

discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to

18

whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom

19

line, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely

20

discretionary denial is -- is an implication on the

21

merits.

22

MR. MORAN:

Yes, exactly as in Virginia.

In

23

Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the -- the

24

Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a

25

petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that each petition is considered on the merits, and a

2

denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits

3

that precludes relitigation under the law of the case

4

doctrine.

5

is exactly like the one in Virginia.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now

Is that something the

7

intermediate appellate court has said?

8

that, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but

9

every -- in every case it's a merits decision?

Have they said

We don't

10

have any decisions that say we are exercising our

11

discretion not to review.

12

MR. MORAN:

If a -- if a appeal or an

13

application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in

14

the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect,

15

then the court will occasionally issue an order denying

16

the application for that reason.

17

filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding

18

practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is

19

denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But for any properly

This means, I would presume,

21

that -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our

22

Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to

all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all

on the merits.

beginning relitigation on State collateral review.

17

the State very happily argues for all of those purposes

that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come

19

before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a

20

decision on the merits.

21

what it says because they are hoping that this Court will

22

conclude that it is a discretionary appeal.

They obtain deference on habeas

And so

It's really discretionary despite

In fact, the State -

2

appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier

3

appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the

4

actual function of that court because there is a provision

5

that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case,

6

after sentencing, that there are issues that she should

7

have raised, it allows her to do that.

8

now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and

9

then the application that follows after that to the

10

The State maintains that the

And so the State

Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal.

11

I'll just point out that even the State's amicus

12

doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light

13

of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to

14

reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Moran, before your -

16

your time is up, I did want to know what is your position

17

on -- let's say that there is -- you prevail and there is

18

a right to counsel for these applications to appeal.

19

if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is

20

no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the

21

equivalent of an Anders brief?

22

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

And

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in

23

fact, I have done that personally.

25

in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on

2

cases -- I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my

3

head -- after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel

4

then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no

5

grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got

6

whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining,

7

at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be

8

filed or -- or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of

9

an Anders brief.

10
11

And in a significant percentage of the

And so that is done in a number of

cases.
It is our position that that procedure actually

12

helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because

13

without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr.

14

Halbert, a special education student with mental

15

disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall

16

-- and filing, in -- in his case, with the help of a

17

fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself

18

-- the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is

19

completely incoherent, misses several issues that are

20

right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that

21

his sentencing guidelines were misscored but -- but

22

without explaining why, without even identifying which

23

sentencing guidelines were misscored.

24
25

And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that
was approximately three times too high under the

The State concedes that one of the

That was

And so Mr. -- Mr.

Michigan requires -- Michigan is one of the few

11

States that requires that ineffective assistance of

12

counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost.

13

And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way

14

to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing,

15

which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial

16

counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still

17

available to be called, all from prison, and there was no

18

possible way he could do that.

19

surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate,

20

that his application for leave to appeal was completely

21

incoherent.

22

So it's not very

The fellow inmate actually did write the -- the

Under the statute, only if there was already an upward

departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would

the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course,

the guidelines, as misscored without objection from

defense counsel -- there was no upward departure at that

point.

If the Court has no further questions, I'd like

to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. RESTUCCIA

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

I want to start with the factual claim regarding

16

the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from

17

the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert,

18

in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate

19

counsel.

20

he was told specifically it's under these conditions

21

you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you

22

might be appointed counsel.

23

that he would otherwise not receive counsel.

24
25

I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that

From context it's unambiguous

And what's important is at the joint appendix on
page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding

29
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

on this point.

2

that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate

3

counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have

4

-- you would have to conclude that the trial court was

5

clearly erroneous in its factual finding.

6

So in order for this Court to conclude

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I mean, wouldn't we have

7

to conclude that if we're going to apply the same

8

standards here that we usually do in -- in the plea waiver

9

situation?

I mean, we -- the -- the classic point of it

10

all is the knowing -- the -- the intelligent, voluntary

11

waiver of a known right.

12

protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I

13

don't see that there would be -- have been an adequate

14

waiver here because he was never told that he had the

15

right that he now claims as a matter of due process.

16

indeed, dispute it.

17

MR. RESTUCCIA:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And leaving aside the equal

You

Yes.
But unless he were told that,

19

the -- the waiver that -- that depends upon parsing the

20

difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of

21

explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate

22

for a waiver of a known right.

23

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I -- I think that the colloquy

24

makes clear that he does not -- he's not going to have an

25

appeal as of right, and then when told that -

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the -- the appeal of his

2

right -- the appeal as of right point, as I understand it,

3

is a different point.

4

will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether

5

your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you

6

ask for it.

7

and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the

8

right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it,

9

that there wouldn't be a -- an -- an adequate waiver under

10
11

What they're getting at there is it

We're here dealing with the right to counsel,

Boykin.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

I think in -- in context when

12

told that only under these circumstances you're going to

13

receive counsel in bringing discretionary application,

14

that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go

15

forward with the -- his plea -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, the -- imagine -- I'm

17

just repeating what Justice Souter said.

18

19

I haven't heard the answer.

20

There must be -

He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does.

21

1

not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to

2

waive.

3

He has no such right.
Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to

4

waive, how could he waive anything?

5

person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal

6

no matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to

7

appeal, I mean, really.

8
9

MR. RESTUCCIA:

And obviously, a

I think that the -- the -- for

the two questions that are asked, he explains -- the court

10

explained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but

11

then said -

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:
Right?

14
15
16

Okay, that's the end of it.

MR. RESTUCCIA:

the waiver consists of.

23

and that's what the judge is asking.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll

is -

front of us.

Is it constitutional or not constitutional?

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I think that -- I also want to

12

make the point, of course, that there was a factual

13

finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to

14

find the trial court was clearly erroneous.

15

The --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Restuccia, the -- we are

17

dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is

18

learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court

19

did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to

20

counsel in seeking leave to appeal.

21

if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but

22

did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to

counsel in seeking leave to appeal.

24
25

It said only when -

And I was curious as a matter of what is going
on in Michigan trial courts now.

Do judges routinely tell

33
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

defendants who plead guilty -- tell them not only when the

2

court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you

3

relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to

4

appeal?

Because that --

5

MR. RESTUCCIA:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7
8
9

Yes.
-- that was never imparted in

this case.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

The advice concerning right to

appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was

10

a form from 2000.

11

the Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been

12

modified now that -- because the trial court -- it seems

13

apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning

14

right of -- to appeal.

15

say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at

16

public expense to assist you in filing an application for

17

leave to appeal.

18

would happen differently, but I think that -

19

The -- the 2004 form is available from

The way it reads now is it will

So this -- this -- the colloquy now

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, your case is a

20

little stronger than -- than the court just asked -- just

21

saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I

22

must appoint counsel in another circumstance.

23

have left open the implication that you could appoint

24

counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and

25

to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I

That might

34
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

might appoint counsel in the other circumstance.

2

there's any implication from it, the implication is not

3

just that I have -- I have listed all the areas in which I

4

must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I

5

either must or even may, if there's an implication.

6

MR. RESTUCCIA:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if

I think -- I think that's right.
Well, apparently the people

8

who -- who redid the model instructions thought that this

9

would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get

10
11
12
13

counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

That's right.

And they -- they

did -- they did modify the form.
So on the question of the underlying

14

constitutionality, I want to -- I want to make a few

15

points, that the -- the threshold question really is

16

whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a

17

plea-based conviction.

Michigan law is clear that there

18

is no appeal by right.

It's an application process and

19

it's a discretionary review.

20

Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these

21

cases, has no obligation to review the merits.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The Michigan Court of

Do you agree with your

23

opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the

24

intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?

25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No.

The law in the Sixth

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case -- an earlier

2

case, McKenzie v. Smith -- had determined that the -- a

3

decision with that language, that virtually identical

4

language, is not -- is not entitled to deference.

5
6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So your opponent has

misrepresented Michigan law.

7

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No.

I didn't say -- I wasn't

8

suggesting that.

9

McKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.

10

Abela is one case stating one position.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But he says there are dozens

11

of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in

12

the way he described.

13
14
15
16
17
18

Is that wrong?

MR. RESTUCCIA:
cases.

Well, he didn't cite those

I JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, he didn't, but do you

think he's wrong?
MR. RESTUCCIA:

I -- I know that our office

handles all the habeas -- habeas corpus -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. RESTUCCIA:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you think he's wrong?

I think he is wrong.

The -

Are you going on -- on record

22

as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the

23

United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a

24

result of one of these determinations?

25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The Solicitor General made that

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

position clear before the argument -- before this Court in

2

Tesmer v. Kowalski.

3

claim.

4

So we have not been advancing that

In fact, we've been advancing a claim JUSTICE SOUTER:

And you have not been -- and -

5

and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in

6

the district courts?

7

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The -- all the habeas petitions

8

are run through the office of the Attorney General, so

9

that the -- when the Solicitor General from the State of

10

Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim,

11

that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there

12

will be -- that argument will not be advanced.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

that's the way it's been.

So, so far as you can tell,

15

MR. RESTUCCIA:

16

And because there is no appeal as of right under

That's right.

That's right.

17

Michigan law, this -- the Douglas case doesn't govern the

18

disposition.

19

And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a

20

meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to

21

bring an application for leave.

22

think the heart of the constitutional issue.

23

Ultimately the -- the controlling is Ross.

That's really the -- I

There are three distinct characteristics of the

24

Michigan system.

25

discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of

The -- the nature of the review is

North Carolina Supreme Court.

Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court

4

of Appeals is an error-correcting court.

5

applications for leave where there is no right to have the

6

merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court.

7

fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan,

8

the reason the Michigan constitution was changed was

9

because of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of

each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140

opinions, having to join in another 280.

So resource

The situations in which the court of appeals
will grant leave on application are rare.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why -- if it's just

denying -- or not granting appeal, why does it use the

boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?

It's used that standard order

The only published case for Michigan in which

there was an application for leave from a plea-based

21

want you to be finished.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could I ask about grounds

presented before we get off this?

24

the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of

merit in the -- in the grounds of application?

Is it conceivable that

is worthy of being entertained?

3

MR. RESTUCCIA:

They're supposed to raise those

arguments.

5

have different meanings, and it can -- it can relate to

6

whether it would justify the resources of the court to

examine the underlying merits of the claim.

8

that's right.

9

I think that's exactly right, that merits can

I think

That's one understanding of the -- of the order

10

that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the

court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the

as of right.

What of Mr. -- Mr. Moran's

19

point that this -- whatever the merits are, it counts as

20

law of the case and it's -- it conclusively determines the

21

issues presented?

22

MR. RESTUCCIA:

That's not what happened in -

23

in People -- in the Bobenal case, which was a court of

24

appeals published decision where the order read virtually

25

identical -- identically to this one, and the court of

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

appeals said it could -- would not be bound by its

2

original denial of leave for the lack of merits on the

3

grounds presented and reached the merits of the claim.

4
5

The same thing happened in -- in the Berry case
in which -

6
7

JUSTICE SOUTER:
though, wasn't it?

8

MR. RESTUCCIA:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

Well, that was the same court,

Right.
But what -- what about

preclusion on other courts?

11

MR. RESTUCCIA:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The In litigation in other courts.

13

They -- did -- did they ever say there is no claim or

14

issue preclusion in other courts as a result of -- of our

15

denials?

16

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The court of appeals was only

17

examining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on

18

subsequent courts.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And any -- any court, I mean,

20

in -- in theory, can -- can revise its own -- its own

21

opinions.

22

on -- on the effect of the judgment in another court, and

23

I take it they have not ruled on that.

24
25

But the -- I mean, we look to preclusion really

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, but both -- both opinions,

in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

on the merits.

2

said it was a merits determination, it would be

3

inconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would be

4

inconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have not

5

been reached.

In other words, if a subsequent court then

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

you tell us, as to Federal courts.

8

MR. RESTUCCIA:

And they have said the same,

Right.

The Federal courts

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, that's another court,

11

and -- and they are not asserting that they've decided on

12

the merits in Federal court.

13
14

MR. RESTUCCIA:
ambiguous.

The Federal courts have been

In other words, the Abela case -- they said -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not talking about what the

16

Federal courts have said.

I'm talking about what -- what

17

Michigan has said and -- and what the court of -- has the

18

court of appeals spoken on that subject?

19

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Yes.

The court of appeals in

20

the Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the

21

identical language of the issue raised here, that this was

22

not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself

23

bound as law of the case because the merits had not been

24

resolved.

25

I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring

2

the proper legal understanding of the applications for

3

leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is

4

discretionary.

5

understanding because there is no right to have the merits

6

reviewed.

7

application were discretionary if a defendant would have a

8

claim to have any error corrected.

9

have a claim on the court of appeals.

I think that fits with common sense

Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the

Otherwise, he would
The court of

10

appeals has full authority to make the determination that

11

even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to

correct the error.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, this is what I'm -- I'm

14

interested in.

15

Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other

16

States have done?

17

a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer.

18

We'll give it to you if you're poor.

19

you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that

20

deal unless you waive it.

21

It seems like Michigan is unique here.

You just say, okay, of course, you have

MR. RESTUCCIA:

But, by the way, if

Well, I think that, in a way,

22

Michigan provides a -- a greater protection by enabling

23

itself.

24

with its review is for the -- for a case where there's a

decisions that States have to make.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It's a

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Because of the error in

scoring?

11

MR. RESTUCCIA:

In fact, anyone who's very

12

familiar with the Michigan guideline system would

13

recognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a break

14

in the scoring of the guidelines.

15

the Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it

16

was properly scored.

17
18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That -- that ultimately

You take the position that in

MR. RESTUCCIA:

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The Offense Variable 9

wouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placed

Is that correct?

There were

I think those claims are -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So at -- at least we have to

7

assume that it was not an error-free sentencing

proceeding.

9

MR. RESTUCCIA:

10

Yes.

Well, more importantly, the kinds of issues at

11

play for the sentencing cases are all like this.

12

they relate to the minimum sentencing.

So these oral arguments relating

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask another question?

24

Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43

25

of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

errors there, the fact that they were not raised until

2

after December 11th would have precluded review at the

3

trial court level?

4

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No.

His -- the point of the

5

trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to

6

withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the

7

sentencing itself because the court has discretion before

8

sentencing to let him out of his plea.

9

he has to show that the plea was invalid.

After sentencing,
So his time -

10

he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was

11

concerned about consecutive as against concurrent

12

sentences.

13

In -- in summary, the -- the Michigan system -

14

the -- with the limited date to the review and the kinds

15

of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue

16

are not -- are lesser liberty interest questions because

17

they have to do with amount of punishment.

18

system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the

19

defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions

20

regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to

21

have a factual record from which to advance his claims.

22

He's not left to shift for himself, that there is a

23

counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The Michigan

But if the counsel happens to

be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. RESTUCCIA:

And that's always the

2

circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a

3

discretionary application where his prior counsel was

4

ineffective, that he can be left to identify the

5

meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of

6

ineffective assistance of counsel.

7

That's true in Ross as well where your first -

8

where your first appeal as of right, your -- your

9

appellate counsel is incompetent.

You're going to be left

10

to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of

11

ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid

12

procedural bars that you'll be facing.

13

Every system is going to have to draw that line

14

and to say that at some point you're not going to get

15

appointed another attorney.

16

to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another

17

attorney appointed.

18

would have to have two attorneys make a review on your

19

case, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that

20

this Court has recognized that ultimately where there -

since there is no right to appeal, that he had an

opportunity to have a trial counsel -

Just because there's access

10
11

MR. SCHAERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this

13

Michigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt

14

to invalidate that statute here runs counter to this

15

Court's longstanding tradition of deference to the people

16

of the individual States and to their legislatures in the

17

design and implementation of their criminal justice

18

systems.

19

like this is a case about federalism because it involves

20

the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the

21

States' procedural rules.

22

As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case

Respect for the State's choices is especially

23

important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v.

And -- and as to the question of -- of when to

provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded

us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be

7

one of legislative choice, especially since it involves

difficult policy considerations and the allocation of

scarce legal resources.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I take it that the basic

rule that we've followed -- and this is what people are

arguing about -- could be a criminal trial or proceeding,

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's

2

a question of allocating scarce legal resources.

3

-- and this case is a perfect example of that.

4

is not -- does not involve an appeal as of right.

5

involves a discretionary appeal, and -- and that's the

6

vast bulk of -- of appeals that are addressed by the -- by

7

the Michigan Court of Appeals.

all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any other State that's

done it the way Michigan has?
MR. SCHAERR:

I don't believe there's another

16

State that's done it exactly the same way.

17

would point out -- and I think this is important, Justice

18

Breyer -- that -- that at least according to the Michigan

19

Supreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States

20

don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based

21

conviction.

22

expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals

23

from plea-based convictions by -- by allowing prosecutors

24

to impose that -- impose a waiver as a condition of

25

entering into a plea.

But I -- but I

21 of them rule it out entirely and

So -- so the relevant universe for

2

most, and -- and Michigan sort of fits within the middle

3

of those States in terms of the amount of resources that

4

it provides and opportunities that it provides.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's really 12 States at

Are you saying -- I just want

6

to be clear -- that even if this defendant had had paid

7

counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the

8

intermediate court?

9

MR. SCHAERR:

That's correct.

It -- it's

10

discretionary, and that's clear not just -- not just from

11

analysis of the -- of the Michigan courts' opinions, but

12

from the provision of the -- of -- but from the

13

constitutional provision that -- that created this entire

14

controversy, which was added in 1994.

15

section 20.

16

draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and

17

appeals by leave of court.

wanted to have a system of -- of mandatory appeals,

19

they're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from

20

doing that.

21

It's article I,

And that constitutional provision itself

And so -- and so clearly, if this Court adheres

22

to the sharp distinction and -- which I think is equally

sharp and clear, that this Court has made between -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. SCHAERR:

So here we have one factor that is like Douglas,
You can't say
This is

7

Ginsburg, but -- but that's not the distinction that I

understand this Court's decisions draw.

Several times

10

11

first appeal of right and no further.

12

that's Coleman and -- and Finley, among others.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that's -

Of course, the question is

14

whether the words, of right, were essential to that

15

statement.

16

MR. SCHAERR:

I -- I'm assuming that the Court

was being careful in its -- in its choice of words, and I

18

believe it was because that -- that -

MR. SCHAERR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. SCHAERR:

5

Now, so -- so the real question here, with

That's right.
-- I suppose if you wanted to.

That's right.

6

regard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense

7

to extend what the Court did in Douglas to this new

8

situation.

9

Ross and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in -- in Murray, as

We think it does not.

This Court's decisions,

10

I recall, draw -- draw a distinction between the removal

11

of barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of

12

litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand,

13

subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights

14

And -- and I think this Court's care in

15

distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary

16

appeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and -- and to

17

avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies.

18

And we think that's a -- we think that's -- we think

19

that's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do

20

that, for one thing -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May -- may I ask you one thing

22

lest we forget it?

23

assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is -- is not

24

regarded as a determination on the merits and thus

25

preclusive?

Is -- is your argument premised on the

think that helps the argument.

proceedings that -- that do result in decisions on the

does that doesn't create -

But in fact, there are

I thought the question was that the denial of an

10

application for appeal does not have any merits

11

consequence.

Wasn't that the question?

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, yes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does the denial of an

14

application for appeal have any merits consequence?

15
16

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, as -- if -- if that's the

question, I -- I would defer to -- to Michigan counsel -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But I'm asking whether

18

that's a premise of your argument because the consequences

19

of your argument are going to be very different depending

20

on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't,

21

whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.

22

MR. SCHAERR:

I -- I think the distinction is -

23

is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits

24

or not.

25

right and -- and appeals that are discretionary.

I think the distinction is between appeals of

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it's always on the merits,

2

it's an -- it's an appeal of right, it seems to me.

3

can you have a -- a discretionary appeal which always

4

decides the merits of the case?

5

MR. SCHAERR:

How

Well, I -- in -- in fact, I don't

6

think that's what happens in Michigan, and -- and I think

7

the -

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So your -- the assumption of

your argument is that it is not on the merits.

I.e., it

10

is not a merits determination if there's a denial and

11

hence there is no preclusion.

12

MR. SCHAERR:

I -- I think that's true.

Whether

13

it's an assumption of the argument, I'm not -- I'm not so

14

sure.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're talking about a piece of

16

paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals

MR. SCHAERR:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then it lists a whole lot

20

of reasons like a cert petition.

the merits of the case.

MR. SCHAERR:

It's even harder.

You've got to convince them to take it.
MR. SCHAERR:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why draw that distinction?

10

The piece of paper is the same, even harder to write,

11

needs the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the

12

trial court.

13

Why draw that distinction?

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, again, because -- because if

14

you -- if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as

15

-- as in Douglas, you're going to require States to -- to

16

reallocate resources to that priority and away from other

17

priorities.

18

Also, if you -- if you subsidize litigation in

19

the name of providing adequate access to courts or

20

meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a

21

lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about

22

exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that

23

standard.

24
25

And also, if -- and this is particularly
important here I think.

If you require States to

57
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not

2

required to provide in the first place, like the right to

3

seek review of a -- of a plea-based conviction, then you

4

give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or

5

eliminate that right altogether.

who knows?

in the trend in the States away from providing this right.

But perhaps that's what's going on in the -
