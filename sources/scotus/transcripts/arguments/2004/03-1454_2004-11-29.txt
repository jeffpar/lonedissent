ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress

11

has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs

12

with the potential for abuse.

13

Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a

14

high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical

15

use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits

16

interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully

17

controlled confines of federally approved research

18

programs.

19

And with respect to

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, Mr. Clement, the -- I

20

think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very

21

broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on

22

whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its

23

application in this context.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

Well, with respect, Justice

O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled

2

Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because

3

the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval,

4

cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases.

5

And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy

6

did so, as well.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but in Wickard, of

8

course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his

9

wheat did, in part, go in the national market.

You don't

10

have that here.

11

applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use

12

marijuana will be on any interstate market.

13

the area of something traditionally regulated by states.

14

So how do you distinguish Morrison?

15

distinguish Lopez?

16

As I understand it, if California's law

MR. CLEMENT:

And it is in

And how do you

Well, Justice O'Connor, let me

17

first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to

18

think that none of the marijuana that's produced

19

consistent with California law would be diverted into the

20

national market for marijuana.

21

Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every

22

step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of

23

lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and

24

from controlled substances under Schedule I into the

25

national market.

And, of course, the

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, in looking at this

2

broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of

3

California will enforce its law?

4

that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the

5

interstate market, that might be a different thing.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, if it turns out

Well, with respect, Justice

7

O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any

8

reason to assume that California is going to have some

9

sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a

10

fungible national drug market separate.

11

Congress, here, made important findings that you've

12

alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not

13

just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are

14

linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because

15

drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress'

16

words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that

17

have traveled on interstate commerce.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I think

Well, General Clement, what if

19

we were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the

20

District Court could find that there is a narrow segment

21

of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and

22

they had -- say they made such findings.

23

disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

Would we have to

I think you would say they were

irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because -

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But then why do you need to

rely on the possibility of diversion?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, because I think it is a

4

reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I

5

think that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce -

6
7

JUSTICE STEVENS:
it's a nonexistent reality.

8
9

Yeah, but in my hypothesis,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in your hypothetical -- and

if I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis

10

would not turn on whether or not the truth of the

11

supposition that diversion could be prevented, because

12

this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby,

13

Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the

14

relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual

15

plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial

16

effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of

17

activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such

18

a substantial effect.

19

question that the overall production, distribution, and

20

possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances

21

has a profound effect on interstate commerce.

22

And, in this case, there's no

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's not an interstate

23

commerce that you want to foster.

24

-- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to

25

foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v.

I mean, in these other

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Filburn.

2

marijuana.

3

fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate

4

commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate

5

it.

Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in
And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the

I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, no, it doesn't, Justice

7

Scalia, but let me respond in two ways.

8

think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case,

9

that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce

First of all, I

10

includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in

11

interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in

12

interstate commerce.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

And I would suggest that it is a

15

perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to

16

treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just

17

as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband

18

simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's quite a different

20

rational than from Wickard v. Filburn.

21

you're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has

22

a substantial impact on interstate commerce.

23

appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to

24

prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce

25

cannot effectively be implemented without this law.

I mean, it seems to me

You're

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think there's some truth

2

to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this.

3

what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this

4

Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a

5

different regulatory regime.

6

I think

Here, Congress -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you're applying it to the

7

opposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a

8

regulatory regime in which the government wants to

9

prohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or -

10

in interstate commerce.

11

-- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into

12

interstate commerce.

13

for marijuana, because it would supply these local users

14

and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.

15

And if you just follow the litter

In fact, it would reduce the demand

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, Justice

16

Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances

17

Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that

18

there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I

19

substances.

20

market -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in

21

marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis.

But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So -

But to the extent that this

23

statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the

24

interstate market and confine these to locally grown

25

marijuana.

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, first of all, Justice

2

Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion,

3

to get back to -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then I'm assuming -- my

5

hypothetical is that California could pass a law that

6

would prevent diversions from occurring.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in the same way that the

8

Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the

9

marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to

10

have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But just -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose some -- one answer

13

to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy.

15

And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though

16

it was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that

17

case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did

18

not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect

19

on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the

20

entire class of activities.

21

And if I could -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, as Justice O'Connor

22

brought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez -

23

they all involve a commercial enterprise.

24

we're told this is different, because nobody is buying

25

anything, nobody is selling anything.

And, here,

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, Justice

2

Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was

3

to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce

4

to activity that the Court described as economic, but not

5

commercial.

6

and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way

7

that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.

And I think the production and distribution

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're -- no, I was going

to -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two

10

particular patients in this case are simply -- simply

11

cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in

12

the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think,

13

growing it themselves or being given it.

14

you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to

15

generalize in deciding this case.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

You're saying,

That's exactly right, Justice

17

Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this

18

Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz

19

and Perez.

20

particular, only because it, too, involves a non

21

commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of -

And I point to the Wickard case, in

Well, I do take issue with

As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a
A portion of his wheat went on the

2

himself, but part of it was commercial.

3

can be distinguished on the facts.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

He used some of it
I think Wickard

Well, Justice O'Connor, it could

5

be -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts,

6

of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in

7

Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was

8

only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat

9

involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm.

10

And -

11
12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The other portion is a matter

of [inaudible] interstate commerce.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's true, Justice

14

O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion,

15

Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side

16

all of the grain that was going to go in interstate

17

commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents.

18

This case is only interesting, he said, because it

19

involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm.

20

And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would

21

be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be

22

consumed by the family.

23

disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the

24

record of the case.

25

it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding

And what he said is, the intended

And, by that, I take him to mean that

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue

2

there.

3

Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all

4

the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it

5

applied to the wheat that was used by the family for

6

consumption of their own bread.

7

Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation.

And it's important to recognize that the way the

8
9

And, nonetheless, this

And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of
the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the

10

Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state

11

law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not,

12

is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. CLEMENT:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is -

-- authority.
-- this a harder or easier

16

case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was

17

lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to

18

buy and sell marijuana?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Well, Justice Kennedy Does this make your case

easier, in a sense, or -

22

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it does, Justice Kennedy,

23

because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question

24

from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a

25

context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

something in interstate commerce entirely, and has

2

exercised that power, so it treats something as

3

effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then

4

takes the complementary step, especially in light of the

5

fungibility of the product, and says, "We're just going to

6

treat this as contraband simpliciter."

7

judgement by Congress has a very definite link to

8

interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to

9

regulate interstate commerce.

10

I think that

And I do think there's a sense in which when

11

Congress is regulating the price of something, there's

12

certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small

13

producers and for Congress to say, "Well, we can still

14

have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority

15

of production."

16

unlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks

17

precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of

18

lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for

19

example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime.

20

But with respect to something that's

It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal

21

in promoting health.

22

that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything

23

beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has

24

been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been

25

available as a Schedule III substance, called -

And I think the clearest example of

13

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's -

-- Marinol.
-- but there is, in this

4

record, a showing that, for at least one of the two

5

plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of

6

them worked.

7

Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs.

8

law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs.

9

But let's suppose that you're right, generally.

This was the only one that would.

And it The

If there

10

were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this

11

case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a

12

federal prosecution?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we

14

would take the position, based on our reading of the

15

Oakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different

16

justices on this Court read the opinion differently and

17

had different views on the extent to which the medical-

18

necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I

19

would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it

20

took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the

21

first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of

22

Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not

23

available.

24
25

But I think, in any event, what is important, at
this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled

2

Substances Act in an injunctive action.

3

that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this

4

Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider

5

only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of

6

activities that's at issue.

7

And I think, in

I think, in this regard, it's also worth

8

emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's

9

argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or

10

the fact that their conduct is lawful under California

11

law, is that there's a mismatch between what California

12

law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for

13

arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate

14

commerce.

15

of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law,

16

without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved

17

in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines.

Because the California law makes the possession

18

And so, if Respondents are right on their

19

Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right

20

because their conduct is lawful under state law or because

21

their -- that marijuana use is medical.

22

then I think their analysis would extend to recreational

23

use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and

24

would extend to every state in the nation, not just -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If they're right,

Well, I think -

MR. CLEMENT:

-- those states that made it

lawful.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Doesn't it depend on how you

4

define the "relevant class of activities"?

5

entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a

6

narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the

7

statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular

8

very narrowly defined class?

9

to define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad

10

Is it the

And is it ever permissible

argument that you make?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think that is

12

permissible, Justice Stevens.

13

Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard -

14
15

I think that's what this

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying that this

statute could never have an unconstitutional application.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Under the Commerce Clause, I -

17

that's exactly right, that would be our position.

18

constitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that

19

line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought,

20

but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied

21

challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of

22

the statute as a whole -

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It is

But, in Morrison, did the

24

Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify

25

Commerce Cause -- Clause legislation by using a long but

1

for causal chain from the activity in question to an

2

impact on interstate commerce?

3

certainly made that statement.

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Which cuts against what

you're saying.

8
9

Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor,

but -

7

I mean, the Court

MR. CLEMENT:
so.

Well, with respect, I don't think

And I'd say two things about it.

One, this Court, in

10

Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize -

11

thought it very important to emphasize two things:

12

one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way

13

that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second,

14

the Court also made it clear that the regulation that

15

there -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of

16

an overall regulatory scheme.

17

points, this case is on the constitutional side of the

18

line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.

19

And I think, on both

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The argument on the other

20

side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use

21

-- growing for personal use, under prescription -

22

MR. CLEMENT:

I understand that -- I understand

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we rule for the Respondents

in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana
would go up or down in California?

MR. CLEMENT:

I would be speculating, Justice

12

Kennedy, but I think the price would go down.

13

that what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the

14

government's position, which is to say, when the

15

government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to

16

prohibit it.

17

going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition

18

actually would force the price up.

19

in which this regulation, although not primarily designed

20

as a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I

21

think, does have the effect of increasing the price for

22

marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the

23

-- and in a way that reduces demand.

24

all consistent with Congress' judgement here.

And I think

about Marinol, what's important there is that the process

of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful

who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think, in responding to

18

that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for

19

purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is

20

something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government

21

treats it as a Schedule I substance.

22

that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a

23

particular patient; but that's something that this Court,

24

I think, has previously understood, that the federal

25

regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's the import of the

Rutherford decision with Laetrile.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think there could be

any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could

disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no

Would we have to ignore that?

11

congressional finding or the judicial finding if that

12

happened?

13

Would we have to follow the

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it depends on the exact

14

hypothetical you have in mind.

15

judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and

16

this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a

17

finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case

18

where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that

19

the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule

20

is invalid, arbitrary, capricious.

21

after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance

22

without a valid medical use in treatment.

situation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a

24

different statute that raised a harder question, where

25

Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left

I think the -- the

it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for

2

changing realities.

3

that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a

4

way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III.

5

But, here, Congress made it clear

And I think it's wrong to assume that there's

6

any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here.

7

mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from

8

Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect

9

of making it easier to prescribe and more available.

I

But

10

I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try

11

to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for

12

diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe

medicine -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Have there -

-- available to patients -- have there been any

17

applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the

18

FDA?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

There have been a number of those

20

petitions that have been filed.

21

rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999.

22

There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-

23

iteration effort to change the rescheduling that

24

culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s.

25

So there's definitely been these efforts.

There was one recently

But on the

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

current state of the -- of the record, there just is not a

2

justification for changing the schedule.

3

And I think both of the briefs talked a little

4

bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the

5

medical efficacy of marijuana.

6

that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to

7

a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for

8

the individual components in marijuana, that smoked -

9

smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as

And I think one thing

10

medicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two

11

reasons.

12

chemical components in crude marijuana that one would

13

smoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that

14

all 400 of those would be helpful.

15

process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude

16

material that somebody could grow in their garden, and

17

actually have people who do this for a living get involved

18

in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial

19

components, and then manufacturing and making that

20

available.

One, there's something like 400 different

21

And a big part of the

The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't

22

have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people

23

understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of

24

tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana.

25

that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery

And so the idea

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

device for medicine, I think, is also something that

2

really doesn't have any future as medicine.

3

What does have a future for medicine, of course,

4

is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial

5

component.

6

that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form

7

that Marinol is available in.

8

research to try to figure out different ways to deliver

9

that substance.

That's been done with Marinol.

It is true

And there's ongoing

But there is, in a sense, a little bit of

10

a -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five

11

pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that

12

there's something of a tradeoff.

13

downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it

14

takes longer to get into the bloodstream.

15

one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that

16

Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer

17

to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the

18

characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused,

19

which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of

20

the substance and the time that it has an effect on the

21

system.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because one of the

But that's also

May I go back to your point a

23

few minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric

24

point -- you, in effect, said, "If this argument succeeds

with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next

real way to distinguish between them."

3

way to distinguish between them?

4

consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the

6

question, "What good reasons are there to define a

7

subclass this way?"

8

Wouldn't this be a

That in deciding what

In this particular case, the good reasons to
define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits -

10

whether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but

11

the benefits which the doctors say that, under present

12

circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to

13

taking the synthesized drug.

14

There's no such argument, I would guess, in

15

favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate

16

category.

17

there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the

18

Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without

19

any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?

And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't

20

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Souter, I

21

don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to

22

get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress'

23

judgement about defining a class of activities -

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That may -- oh, that may be,

but it seems to me that that's a separate argument,

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because you're -- you were arguing before that if you

2

recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing

3

the line against private recreational usage.

4

suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that

5

line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you

6

accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to

7

categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems

8

to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-

9

Congress argument.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

And I'm

Well, Justice Souter, I have no

11

doubt that this Court could draw a line.

12

find it very difficult to police that line over the broad

13

variety of cases.

frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against

15

Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

22

I think it would

MR. BARNETT:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

23

I have two points to make.

First, the class of

activities involved in this case are non-economic and

wholly intrastate.

Second, the federal prohibition of

this class of activities it not essential -- is not an

2

essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be

undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.

4

If you accept the government's contrary

5

contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v.

6

Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-

7

reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over

8

intrastate activity.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on your first point,

10

can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous

11

market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that

12

simple possession of that commodity is a form of

13

participation in the market?

14

MR. BARNETT:

It can be, or it might not be.

15

you possess an item that came from the market or is going

16

to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of

17

the marketplace.

18

that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the

19

market -- it didn't come from the market and it's not

20

going to the market -

If

But if you're in possession of an item

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. BARNETT:

Well, but it's fungible.

That -- the fungibility issue is

23

in this case, but the -- but a -- the fact that a good is

24

fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not

25

make the possession of that good an economic activity.

Now, are those -- are those laws, likewise,

13

unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce

power?

MR. BARNETT:

Not if they're an essential part

16

of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut,

17

unless those activities are reached.

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why is that different

from this?

20

MR. BARNETT:

Because this class of activities

-- because it's been isolated by the State of California,

22

and is policed by the State of California, so that it's

23

entirely separated from the market -

24

Isolated and -- I understand

that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the

of activities that has been identified by the State of

with whether the state separately regulates it, and I

can't find any support at all for that in any case.

that regular household chores of -- say, performed in an

2

earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic -

washing dishes, making bread.

marijuana isn't?

And now you say growing

MR. BARNETT:

If you accept the government's

definition of economic, then every -- then washing dishes,

7

today, would be economic, and that -

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. BARNETT:

No, but even -

-- would be within the -- within

10

the power of Congress to reach.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But even if we accept your

12

definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis

13

upon which we ought to make a category decision.

14

it's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a

15

self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for

16

nothing.

17

or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe

18

that, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of

19

argument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody

20

is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the

21

backyard.

22

going to get it on the street.

23

under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it

24

and use it.

25

Why isn't that the sensible assumption?

You say

But I don't see what reason that you have given,

MR. BARNETT:

Well, they have an -- they have a

2

very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because

3

getting it on the street is going to subject them to

4

criminal prosecution, under both California and federal

5

law, as well as the -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but the -- it's also the

7

case that approximately 10 percent of the American

8

population is doing that every day, if I accept the

9

figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting

10

prosecuted.

11

MR. BARNETT:

But we're talking -- in that case,

12

we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for

13

recreation.

14

who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate

15

the law.

We are talking about a class of people here

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if I am a sick person, I'm

17

going to say, "Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid

18

who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small

19

quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me,

20

either."

21

it seems to me, to avoid the street market.

22

MR. BARNETT:

I mean, there's not going to be any incentive,

The government, in their brief,

23

asserts that the -- that the possession statute that

24

currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why

enforce the possession statute that they say is so

essential to the -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. BARNETT:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If one -

-- regulatory scheme.
-- if one takes your view,

6

that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside

7

Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you

8

have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state,

9

somebody whose doctor says, "This person needs marijuana

10

to live," but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use

11

Act -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale,

12

grown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say

13

Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief

14

properly.

15

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor,

16

because there's the -- that's the second step of the

17

analysis.

there, then they could also apply in these other states.

But then if the Court adopts -

The first step of the analysis is the

21

If you don't -- if the Court stops

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you -- if you buy that

it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate

24

medical use anywhere.

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

All right.

Now you're going

to have some limiting -

3

MR. BARNETT:

But a limiting principle is the

4

one that I -- was identified by the Court in Lopez in

5

which the government is asserting that if it's an

6

essential part of a broader regulation of economic

7

activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached.

8

And the difference between states in which there is a

9

state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that

10

there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use,

11

is completely different from a practical enforcement

12

standpoint than a state in which there is no

13

differentiation.

14

example, of identification cards, which the State of

15

California is going to be issuing, like driver's license

16

cards.

17

Just think of the existence, for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeah, but it doesn't right

18

now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your

19

view.

20

MR. BARNETT:

Well, because -- but this is the

21

sort of regulation -- the sort of effectiveness of the

22

regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact -

23

I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting

24

the State of California to be able to administer its

25

regime.

There is no regime in other states to trust, and,

1

therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that

2

activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which

3

the states are not attempting to pursue the health of

4

their citizens -- the goal of preserving the health of

5

their citizens this way, that would fall under the

6

exception which this Court suggested in Lopez -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is a new framework, I

8

take it, and it's very interesting.

9

that interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez

10

And one of the things

should have come out my way.

11

[Laughter.]

12

MR. BARNETT:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well It's essential to regulate

14

guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory

15

scheme.

16

MR. BARNETT:

Justice Breyer, that's the reason

17

why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it

18

doesn't reach your result.

19

[Laughter.]

20

MR. BARNETT:

If that exception were treated as

21

broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent

22

in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will

23

swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited

24

to their facts.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought we didn't need

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection

2

here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a

3

market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess,

4

a little more obvious and a little more close than what I

5

had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the

6

connection between guns, education, communities, and

7

business.

8

believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far

9

further than this, which is just direct.

So I would have thought, given the -- and I

10

MR. BARNETT:

But this case is completely unlike

11

those cases.

12

that gun probably did come through interstate commerce,

13

not that I believe it should have made any difference, but

14

it probably did.

15

that don't.

16

this class of activities and this interstate market.

This case is completely isolated.

In Lopez,

Here, we're talking about substances

So there's just no literal connection between

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we didn't decide that, in

18

Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in

19

interstate commerce.

20

applied only to guns that had been transported in

21

interstate commerce, the case might have come out

22

differently.

If the statute in question had

might have come out different.

4

only way to make it an interstate connection is through

5

some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in

which somebody who's doing something over here is going to

have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over

there.

There is no interstate

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sounds like Wickard to me.

Well, Wickard, Your Honor -

MR. BARNETT:

Had that case been about eating

wheat, that case would never have arisen.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's what it was about,

19

as far as the Court's analysis was concerned.

20

there were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the

21

wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but

22

it seems to me the analysis of the case said, "You take it

23

-- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it

24

yourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in

25

interstate commerce."

To be sure,

1

MR. BARNETT:

It's -- the entire analysis -- the

2

entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was

3

proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the

4

farms.

5

the family -- at the family table; it meant feeding to

6

your livestock and then putting it -- your livestock -

And by "home-consumed," it did not mean eating at

JUSTICE SCALIA:
"feeding to livestock"?

9

MR. BARNETT:

11

Strange phrase, to mean

But the -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"Home-consumed" is feed it to

your pig?

MR. BARNETT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BARNETT:

But, yes, that's exactly what I don't think so.

-- that's exactly what that

15

general term -- how that general term was used in this

16

case.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what the Court said, I take

18

it -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it

19

says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown

20

wheat, not the part that went in -- quote, "though it may

21

not be regarded as commerce" -

22

MR. BARNETT:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- end quote, still can be

24

regulated, quote, "whatever its nature," so long as,

25

quote, "it exerts a substantial economic effect on

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

interstate commerce."

2

take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought,

3

from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown

4

wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on

5

something that is.

Now, that's the language, and I

With all respect -

MR. BARNETT:

With all respect, what -- that's

-- I was about to make that -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

speaks in terms of commerce.

13

MR. BARNETT:

Well, the Commerce Clause

Right.

Right.

What the Court was

14

using here was the narrower -- the traditional definition

15

of "commerce" that Justice Thomas has been urging this

Court to adopt.

'commerce.'"

19

and production.

20

though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense.

what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court

22

correctly called it, in Lopez, was "economic activity."

Production is economic activity.

2

Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the

3

statute was aimed at.

4

The statute -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why is this not economic

5

activity, if you use the term in that broad sense?

6

marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was

7

grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't

8

have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic

9

activity.

10

MR. BARNETT:

This

What made it an economic activity

11

in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial

12

enterprise, that it was being used on the farm -- not in

13

interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise

14

of the farm.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, I don't think that's -

16

that faithfully represents what the opinion said.

the opinion covered -- including the amount that he

18

consumed himself, and his family consumed.

19

MR. BARNETT:

I think

The -- look, I -- for whatever

20

it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute

exempted small commercial farms.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I pick "trivial impact"?

No, but if it -- "trivial

impact," is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of

view?

1

MR. BARNETT:

The only effect it could have on

2

the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has

any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users

4

from the illicit drug market.

5

are now in the illicit drug market -- and we don't know

whether they are or not -

And to the extent that they

18

If you reduce demand, you

Are you sure?

It's the other way

Yes.

Oh, you're right.

You're

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Your whole argument for

19

triviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for

20

triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with

21

the government about how many people are involved, because

22

I take it you accept the assumption that the more people

23

who are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it

24

is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be

25

without an effect on the market.

So the whole argument

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

boils down to how many people are going to be involved.

2

You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure.

3

Let me ask you a question that would -- that would get to,

4

maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how

5

many people there are in California who are undergoing

6

chemotherapy at any given time?

7

MR. BARNETT:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Isn't that number going to be

indicative of the demand for marijuana?

10
11

I do not know the answer to that.

MR. BARNETT:

It could be, Your Honor, but that

also illustrates -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if you -- if you accept

13

that, then there's nothing implausible about the

14

government's hundred-thousand number, is there?

15

MR. BARNETT:

But whatever -- I don't know,

1

does not seem like an implausible number.

2

if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility

3

reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a

4

controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is

5

enforceable, or not.

6

assume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number

7

would go up.

8
9

And, in fact,

And the reason -- there is reason to

So, if you accept that line of argument, then
your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is

10

going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable.

11

missing something?

12

MR. BARNETT:

Well, two things.

Am I

First of all,

13

whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people

14

who are sick, who are sick enough to use this.

15

not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example,

16

recreational activity is, where lots of people could just

17

decide to do it.

18

on a physician's recommendation, for this particular

19

activity.

That is

We're talking about people who qualify,

That will limit the number.

20

But the amount of the people -- the effect on

21

commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn

22

aggregation principle applies to the class of activities

23

in this case, and it does not apply to the class of

24

activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we

25

assert that they are.

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well -- but that is circular

2

reasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that

3

it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are -

4

the numbers are so few -- the number of people involved,

5

from what you could generalize, are so few that it would

6

not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market.

7

there would be a large market effect, it makes no more

8

sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non

9

economic.

10

MR. BARNETT:

If

Lopez and Morrison stand for the

11

proposition that activities that simply have an effect on

12

the market are not necessary -- that does not make them

13

economic.

14

because an activity has an effect -- an economic effect

makes the activity, itself, economic.

MR. BARNETT:

But just -- just have it -- just

-- whether an activity is economic, you have to look to

the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one

24

that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the

production of things for sale and exchange, barter.

premised on the ability to tell the difference between

economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty,

on the other.

But your whole jurisprudence

6

in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got

7

to identify the entire range of potential effect based on

8

the particular character of two individuals in their -- in

9

their supply of marijuana.

And the whole point of this

10

argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic

11

premise on which to base constitutional law.

12

MR. BARNETT:

The premise of our -- the premise

13

of our economic claim is the nature of the activity

14

involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of

15

activity it is.

prostitution is an economic activity.

So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old

saying meant that you have to make your defense in the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. CLEMENT:

7

may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

As I understand Respondents' position, it's
effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in

10

their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically

11

sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it

12

has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on

13

the government's overall regulatory regime.

14

understand that to be true largely because of state law.

15

And I

And one of the many problems with that mode of

16

analysis is that the state law is not designed only to

17

carve out those transactions that have no effect on

18

interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory

19

regime.

20

cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make

21

medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it

22

in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the

23

marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether

24

you bought it, whether you grew it yourself.

25

fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I

think, undermines their theory.

2

Now, there's the question now about what kind of

3

impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme.

4

Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from

5

one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's

6

a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical

7

users, if their position prevails.

8

is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation,

9

so the numbers may be a bit off.

Now, obviously, this

But they suggest that

10

our own government numbers are somehow better, and they

11

cite them on page 18 of the red brief.

12

numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in

13

the four counties for which there are data, there was -

14

.5 percent of the people use marijuana.

15

extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in

16

California, that gives you 170,000 people.

17

numbers -- using the government numbers actually give you

18

more potentially affected people.

19

But the only

Now, if you

So their

I think in trying to figure out how many people

20

would be affected, it's worth considering what medical

21

conditions are covered.

22

Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or

23

people with terminal cancer?

24

want to look at what is covered as a serious medical

25

condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of

the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it

2

suggests that a serious medical condition -- there's a

3

catchall at the end that includes subsection 12 -- "Any

4

other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not

5

alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety

6

or physical or mental health."

7

exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical

8

condition for which somebody could be -- get a

9

recommendation for marijuana for medical uses.

10

Now, I think that is an

Another point worth considering, in considering

11

the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the

12

effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion,

13

is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief.

14

One is the People against Wright.

15

arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana.

16

They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his

17

pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his

18

backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then

19

a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck.

20

yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was

21

entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was

22

for medical use.

23

fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be

24

explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and

25

that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off.

There's somebody who's

And

The fact that he had a scale, and the

I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to

2

enforce the regulatory regime.

3

The other case in the reply brief worth

4

mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case

5

where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said

6

that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled

7

Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative.

8

just shows that this is not something that will be limited

9

to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial

impact on the government's ability to enforce the

Controlled Substances Act.
