ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

9
10
11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These cases implicate the fundamental power of

12

the United States to protect its borders by excluding

13

aliens who arrive at its borders, but are found under the

14

law not to qualify for admission.

15

This Court held more than 100 years ago in

16

Nishimura Ekiu that the power of a nation to forbid the

17

entrance of foreigners within its dominions is inherent in

18

sovereignty and is central to self-preservation.

19

were otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and

20

its security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who

21

might choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the

22

self-help efforts of aliens who might leave another

23

country coming to our shores.

24

involving Haitians and Cubans over the last 35 years

25

vividly illustrate the adverse consequences of such a

If it

The migration crises

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

regime, and events of recent years confirm that the

2

threats to the Nation's borders and security are not

3

limited to nearby nations.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this Court held only 3

5

years ago that the statute before us here does not permit

6

the Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- the Court addressed one of

8

the statutes before the Court here.

It's -- it's

9

important I -- I think to recognize another statute and -­

10

that is -- reflects the background principle of this

11

Court's decision in Mezei.

12

that.

13

And if I may explain, to do

This Court made clear in Mezei that an alien has

14

no substantive due process right to enter the United

15

States when the executive branch has determined, under the

16

law, that he has no right to enter the United States.

17

relevant --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Kneedler, recognizing

19

that distinction, is that a distinction drawn by the

20

statute that's before us?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

The

Yes, I believe it is, but it -­

22

but -- but first of all, there is another statute which is

23

highly relevant to this, and that is 1182(d)(5)(A), the

24

parole statute.

25

long governed whether an alien who arrives at our shores

It is the parole statute that -- that has

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and has not been shown to be admissible may enter the

2

United -- may enter the United States.

3

is set forth at petition appendix 3a -- excuse me -- page

4

3a of our brief.

5

affirmatively authorizes aliens to enter the United

6

States.

7

It is written entirely in terms of the discretion of the

8

Attorney General, now the Secretary of Homeland Security.

9

It says the Attorney -- the Secretary may, in his

10

discretion, temporarily under conditions that he

11

prescribes and for urgent and humanitarian reasons, parole

12

an alien into the United States.

13

does not constitute an admission, and it may be revoked at

14

any time when the Secretary in his opinion concludes that

15

the purposes of the parole have been satisfied.

The parole statute

That is the only statute that

That statute is -- obviously confers no rights.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it says that parole

So are you -- are you arguing

17

now that -- that (5)(A) -- (d)(5)(A), is the statute under

18

which you are detaining him and that 1231(a)(6) has

19

nothing to do with the case?

20
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

They -- they are independent

authorities for the detention -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so you're arguing -- then

23

you are.

You're saying -- this is coming to me a little

24

bit anew.

25

I thought -- let's assume you lose on 1231(a)(6), that I

I perhaps didn't read it carefully enough.

But

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

can't think of a way.

2

a way of applying the same words to your alien to mean

3

something different than were applied to the alien who was

4

in Zadvydas.

5

Let's assume that I can't think of

Suppose you lose on that point.

Now you're saying, well, independently of that,

6

we have a different statute under which we can detain him,

7

namely 1182(d)(5)(A).

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

Is that -­

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, absolutely, and the -- and

the -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now is that argument -­

I mean, I'm sorry that I -­
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and we -- we make -- we do

make that argument in our brief.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and that -- and so is that

15

made in the courts below and everything that they're doing

16

in the cases -­

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

We made it at -- we made it

18

in both courts below, and we -- and we think it's clear

19

from the background of -- of this statute that it does -­

20

that it does confer independent authority.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this statute just -- just

22

goes in a circle because it ends.

The way end -- (A) ends

23

is that after revoking the parole, the alien shall

24

forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which

25

he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other

2

applicant for admission to the United States, which refers

3

you back to -- to 1231(a)(6).

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

With respect, it doesn't.

5

1231(a)(6) is an additional -- on its face is an

6

additional grant of detention authority.

7

whereas, the -- the parole authority which -- which for

8

years until -­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is not -- but

Well, this shall continue to be

10

dealt with in the same manner as that of any other

11

applicant -­

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14
15

And an -­
Dealt with includes, it seems

to me, 1231(a)(6).
MR. KNEEDLER:

An applicant for admission

16

includes anyone who has been found not to be admissible to

17

the United States.

18

-- any alien in the United States who has not

19

affirmatively been found to be admissible is an applicant

20

for admission.

21

applicants for admission or aliens who arrive at our shore

22

establish that detention, even indefinite detention, is -­

23

is not only permitted, but required unless the Secretary

24

releases someone.

25

8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(1) provides that any

And the -- the statutes dealing with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would that -- how would

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that apply to someone who hasn't gotten parole, hasn't

2

gotten any permission, who snuck across the border?

3

That's one of the pieces of this that's incomprehensible,

4

that you are suggesting someone can be detained

5

indefinitely who we allowed in temporarily, but such

6

treatment could not occur with respect to somebody that

7

had no permission at any time to be here.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Well, the -- the parole

9

statute -- if someone was taken into custody, the parole

10

-- who had sneaked across the border, that person, under

11

the 1996 revisions, is an applicant for -- for admission,

12

and the parole statute would govern that.

13

As a constitutional matter, and particularly

14

with respect to procedural due process, the Court has

15

suggested in a number of its cases that there may be a

16

difference between somebody who arrives at our borders and

17

-- and is stopped and somebody who -- who sneaks through.

18

At least as a procedural matter, the Government would have

19

to establish that he has no right to be here.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -­

But may I -­
Well, are -- are you saying

22

that if an alien on -- who seeks admission and is denied

23

admission and is at Ellis Island or the JKF Airport, that

24

the Attorney General is -- does not have to consult

25

1231(a)(6)?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does it say -- I mean,

That's the

11

other provisions such as the one you're now mentioning.

12

just didn't pick up that it was a totally independent

basis.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And then you refer to

And -- and if I may, the

15

-- the special statutes that govern the parole of Mariel

16

Cubans that we reproduce in the appendix to our brief at

17

212.12 were promulgated in 1987 before 1231(a)(6) was

18

enacted in 1996.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, but where does it

20

say that?

I'd like to just glance at it even now.

21

does it say that in your brief, that it's a totally

22

independent basis?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I

Where

On page 12 -- 26 to 27.
That's what I read and it was

2

which is under a bigger heading saying the text,

3

structure, and history of section 1231(a)(6) confirm the

4

executive branch's authority.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

I should -- I should also -­
So perhaps I could be forgiven

for not understanding -­

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

And -- and I should also point

9

out that -- that in -- in our response to the petition in

10

the Benitez petition, we expressly -- we expressly argued

11

that 1182(d)(5)(A) is an independent source of authority.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if -- if there's a statute

13

that directs you with reference to a class, that statute

14

is applicable, and this person is within that class.

15

how can you tell us we can't go or that we needn't go to

16

1231?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

exclusive basis.

19

this category.

20
21

My -- my point is that's not the

I'm not saying that it's inapplicable to

But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Well, it might be exclusive

constitutionally, but the Congress has acted.

22

24

So

Or -- or -­
And once it's acted, you're

controlled.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, or -- or -- but -- but what

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress -- if I may go back to the parole statute, before

2

1231(a)(6) was enacted, the only statute that governed the

3

detention and the release of aliens arriving at our

4

shores, what used to be called excludable aliens, was the

5

parole statute.

6

this Court were ordered -­

7
8

That provision -- until the aliens before

JUSTICE SCALIA:

By which you mean -- parole

statute, by which you mean?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

1182(d)(5)(A).

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Okay.

And until there is an order of

12

exclusion, even now the parole statute is the only statute

13

that governs the detention and release of the alien.

14

I think it would be impossible to read into 1182(d)(5)(A)

15

any 6-month limitation or any limitation at all on how

16

long someone can be detained because that statute sets up

17

a presumption of custody with release only in the

18

discretion of the Attorney General, or now the Secretary

19

of -- of Homeland Security.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

May I interrupt you there, Mr.

21

Kneedler?

Because I mean, the question is whether

22

constitutionally we should respect that presumption.

23

-- and my -- my question basically is this.

24

perfectly well understand and I can understand the -- the

25

argument for respecting that presumption.

And

I can

When you're

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

dealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal

2

territorial sense within the border but are never allowed,

3

in effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who

4

are kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may -- may keep

5

them.

6

It is difficult, however, I -- I think to accept

7

what has been called the -- the fiction of custody.

When

8

we are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely

9

excludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United

10

States by a public announcement of the President of the

11

United States, have been allowed into the American

12

population, just as clearly and as readily as they would

13

have been under any other protocol of admission -- and I

14

guess in this case for something like 20 years -- isn't

15

there a point at which the -- the fiction of exclusion

16

simply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

There are a number of responses

18

to that.

First, as a factual matter, with respect to

19

welcoming into the United States, what gets cited for that

20

proposition is a statement by President Carter in May 5 of

21

1980.

22

to this country, he made clear that people should not do

23

this.

24

brought enforcement actions against people who went there.

25

There were criminal prosecutions that were brought.

10 days later, before the aliens in this case came

He encouraged people not to go to Cuba.

The INS

So

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

people were not encouraged to come to the United States in

2

this way.

3

With respect to the regime that you say -- I

4

believe you said they're -- they're admitted just like

5

under any other regime.

That is not correct.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

allowed into the country.

8

own property, et cetera.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, factually.

They're

You know, they can get jobs,

They were allowed into the

10

country under the parole statute that I just read, which

11

makes -- which makes it clear that they are admitted not

12

-- not in a way that confers any rights on them, but they

13

are admitted in the interest of the United States for

14

public benefits under circumstances which make clear that

15

it is not an admission and that -­

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

I realize but they are

17

admitted in the sense that they say, okay, you can come in

18

and you can do these things, but you get no -- in effect,

19

you get no vested right.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

into the United States.

22

We can take it away like that.
No -- no vested right to come
It is, in effect, a revocable -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

But otherwise -­

23

otherwise they are treated like any other class of aliens

24

who are admitted into the United States.

25

to this condition.

They are subject

The United States makes that clear,

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

but they nonetheless can be in the country and do in the

2

country what other aliens can do.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4
5
6
7

At the sufferance of the United

States.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I know.

Subject to that

condition.
MR. KNEEDLER:

And -- and the question we have

8

here is when the -- when and if the United States,

9

pursuant to this statute, decides no longer to suffer the

10

aliens being at large, but instead return them to the

11

border, in effect, or return them to detention, this

12

statute makes clear that that -- that whatever practical

13

experience they have had at large in the country is always

14

subject to revocation -­

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

I -- I realize that, but

16

the problem is you've got a Due Process Clause that talks

17

about persons not citizens.

18

the fiction that says it doesn't apply to these persons

19

if, for practical purposes, we stop them at the border and

20

we don't let them into society.

21

society, whether we say it's subject to this condition it

22

can be revoked or not, I find it difficult to see a

23

constitutional warrant for drawing the line that you want

24

us to draw.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Maybe I can understand the -­

Once we do let them into

This Court has always treated as

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same the custody of an alien who arrives at the border

2

and has not been admitted, whether that person stays on

3

the boat, goes to Ellis Island, which the Court said was

4

not an entry that gave somebody constitutional rights to

5

come here.

6

of a person who was paroled for 9 years and regarded as

7

not being in the United States.

8
9

In the Kaplan v. Tod case, you had the example

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And what the -­

You're giving me prior

examples, but the issue here is should we continue to

10

respect that -- what has been called that fiction as to

11

people who are allowed into the country and are allowed to

12

move around like other aliens and, indeed, and by and

13

large like citizens.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

With respect, I think it is not

15

-- it is not a fiction with respect to the constitutional

16

issue because there's a critical difference between, for

17

example, a lawful permanent resident -- a person does not

18

acquire lawful permanent resident status by something like

19

adverse possession, by living in the United States for a

20

long period of time.

21

for permission to reside permanently in the United States.

22

It is a grant of a status -­

23

It is an affirmative grant of status

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which can be revoked.

Which

24

can be revoked, and that's the -- the distinction that

25

seems to me strange.

When somebody commits a deportable

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

offense, they are stripped of whatever right they had to

2

be here.

3

someone who is excludable.

4

any right to remain no more than a parolee has.

5

taken away their right to remain.

6

they have no status anymore based on a prior admission

7

that we have removed from them.

8
9

They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as

MR. KNEEDLER:

They -- they do -- do not have
We have

So it seems to me that

This Court -- this Court thought

otherwise in -- in Zadvydas 3 years ago where it drew a

10

distinction.

11

has never entered the country and someone who has effected

12

an entry -­

13
14
15

It said the distinction between someone who

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true.

That's true.

Absolutely we did.
And also, I'll assume for argument's sake that

16

you're completely right on the constitutional point.

17

That's just for argument's sake.

18

there's all kinds of constitutional difference.

But assume you are.

So

19

Still, I don't see how to read the statute one

20

way for one group of people and another way for another.

21

The statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the

22

Attorney General may detain this individual beyond the

23

removal period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the

24

removal period -- may detain beyond the removal period

25

means for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months,

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

presumptively, related -- reasonable time related to the

2

purpose of the statute which is to find a country willing

3

to accept them.

4

Okay?

Now, I haven't found a single case of this Court

5

where you interpret these complicated words one way for

6

about that alien's removal from the United States.

there is a presumption, and perhaps an irrebuttable

presumption, that in the case of the -- the legally

stretch that's giving us the trouble.

say something.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But if -- if I may go to the

detention of the alien on Ellis Island was effectuating

his exclusion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE S. DAHL

14

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MARTINEZ

15
16
17

MS. DAHL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Because the same words mean the same thing in

18

the same statute, this Court need not reach the

19

constitutional questions presented by the indefinite

20

detention of inadmissible as opposed to deportable aliens.

21

Without going to questions of constitutional doubt, there

22

are three reasons why this Court should hold that section

23

1231(a)(6) treats inadmissible aliens the same as it

24

treats deportable aliens.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you get to that, do you

MS. DAHL:

Justice Scalia, I don't believe it

5

provides an independent basis for detention.

6

immigration law works together in it's various elements,

then as an applicant for admission, and section 1229

places the applicant for admission into removal

proceedings.

11

The Government did not obtain a ruling on that

argument from the Ninth Circuit, although it made

schedule.

15

controlled by Lin Guo Xi, which was a statutory

16

construction of 1231(a)(6), and cert was granted on the

17

1231(a)(6) issue only.

18

It ultimately conceded that this case was

The reading of the statute that we proffer, that

19

the same words mean the same meaning, is consistent with

20

the overall changes Congress made in 1996 in IIRIRA when

21

it eliminated the category of excludable aliens and

22

replaced it with a single, broader category, now called

23

removable aliens, that embraces both inadmissible and

24

deportable aliens.

25

Third, Congress knows how to provide for

29
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

indefinite detention when it wants to.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, how do you

3

explain then, Ms. Dahl, the language in the Court's

4

Zadvydas opinion that had, were we dealing with, in

5

effect, off-shore aliens, this would be a much different case?

6

MS. DAHL:

I believe it would present a

7

different question, but the constitutional issues

8

presented by indefinite detention remain.

9

doesn't need to reach those --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The Court

So you say that a

11

person, even though they're not lawfully admitted into the

12

United States, still couldn't be indefinitely detained.

13

MS. DAHL:

Yes, Your Honor, that is our -- our

14

point precisely.

15

said that it -- that this Court has always treated

16

excludable aliens the same.

17

contemporary of the Mezei decision, Kwong Hai Chew, cited

18

at page 45 of our brief, the Court found that an

19

excludable entrant on Ellis Island was entitled to -­

23

In a case that was a

Well, the Government

What do you make of their

We disagree.

I think that it shows

24

that the Court will consider length of time in the country

25

in determining what amount of due process is required.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, the plain language of the statute of

2

1231(a)(6) requires the same treatment between

3

inadmissible and deportable aliens.

4

difference in the language that Congress has used, this

5

Court can draw no distinctions.

6

Where there's no

There is a presumption that Congress expects its

7

statutes to be read in the same manner as the Supreme

8

Court's interpretation, and because of the

9

interrelationship between the parole statute and the

10

revocation proceedings and removability proceedings,

11

there's no reason for this Court to resort to the 1182

12

statute to provide the authority that the Government

13

seeks.

14

The relevant authority is section 1231(a)(6).
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what do you think we

15

should do with the 1182?

your argument that it's the same statute, the same word,

it can't be construed differently under 12-whatever, and

the Government says fine.

answered, I think, the question of whether the Government

10

is entitled in this case, if we dispose of the 1231

question, to resort to the other statute.

12

MS. DAHL:

I don't think that the Court could

13

carve out a statute and use it in a way contrary to the

14

way it functions in the immigration scheme and make

15

superfluous or irrelevant a more express, more detailed

statutory provision.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what you're saying is

that even if 1182 comes first, 1231 comes second.

think that the Government could revoke parole and then

If they've waived it,

What the Ninth Circuit found, though,

20

in questions of an inadmissible alien, that this Court's

would be no need for resort to any other statute.

MS. DAHL:

Yes.

While the alien is awaiting

3

removal, he is subject to supervision conditions that will

4

safeguard the Government's interests, and for as long as

5

he is waiting, he is under supervision.

6

It's those supervision conditions that

distinguish this case from the situation where the

Congress has expressly provided for the indefinite

That -­

That's correct.
What's -- what's your best

answer to the Government's argument that unless you treat

16

this case differently from Zadvydas, at least for purposes

17

of reasonable time or reasonable interest, which affects

18

time, the United States is basically defenseless against

19

countries that -- that want to dump undesirable aliens and

20

force them into the United States?

21

MS. DAHL:

I don't think that applying the

defenseless.

20

the same issues that the release of any person who has

served the sentences that were imposed after the

22

commission of a crime.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, except that with

24

aliens, they can be deported, whereas a citizen can't be,

25

upon release from prison.

MS. DAHL:

of supervision that the Government can impose are much

lengthier and could be even more onerous than the kinds of

supervision conditions after prison that the Government

could impose on its citizens.

In this case, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Zadvydas both

received permission to live here.

MS. DAHL:

comparison between the situation with Mr. Zadvydas and Mr.

Martinez.

19

Detention, of course, needs to be reasonably

related to its purpose.

21

So detention for that purpose becomes arbitrary and

punitive, and we'd ask the Court to affirm the grant of

habeas corpus and Mr. Martinez's release on supervision

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MILLS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BENITEZ

MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

I think that we have lost sight of the statutory

scheme that applies here.

9

initial matter.

Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a

It's clearly not preserved as an

It was not in the answer to either habeas

10

petition.

11

in both cases was 1231(a)(6).

12

The justification given in the district court

But, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand

13

this case because a clear, simple reading of the

14

immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a

15

detention statute.

16

and I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think

17

I can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this

18

morning.

19

You have to go through the process,

When an alien first arrives, he's an applicant

20

for admission.

Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United

21

States Code says an applicant for admission -- any

22

applicant for admission shall be detained until the

23

removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt,

24

that they are entitled to come in.

25

they apply -- that's the detention statute that initially

So all aliens, when

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

applies, 1225(b)(2)(A).

2

there is a removal proceeding.

3

which is governed by 1229(a)(1) -- I'm sorry -- 1226(a) -­

4

it is 1229(a) -- is to determine whether the alien is

5

admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether

6

they must be removed.

7

that point.

8
9

They are to be detained until
The removal proceeding,

So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until

1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the
Government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons

10

and parole an alien in.

We won't have the removal

11

process.

12

of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let

13

you out on parole, which is discretionary.

14

1182(d)(5)(A).

We're going to -- we -- we're going to get out

That's

15

If at any time, we in our discretion think it is

16

no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke

17

that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once

18

parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any

19

other applicant for admission.

20

1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal

21

proceeding.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you go back to

Well, you -- you skipped a -- a

23

phrase.

It says when the Attorney General is of the

24

opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing

25

more, the individual shall return or be returned to the

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

custody from which he began.

2

custody is different in these cases.

3

MR. MILLS:

And their argument is that

That custody is the custody under

4

1225(b)(2)(A).

5

custody.

6

1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings.

7

And in the Demore v. Kim case, this case -- this Court

8

said that even if it's a long time and there aren't other

9

procedures in place, you can be detained until your

10

removal order is entered because -- and -- and the

11

emphasis was there's an end date to that.

12

end date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and

13

it's the removal proceedings.

14

That is the statute that authorizes the

That's what they're being returned to.

So there's an

Section 1231 is the statute that governs removal

15

and says, okay, now what happens?

It says you have to

16

remove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've

17

committed crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise

18

determined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond.

19

says may be detained beyond the period.

20

statute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a

21

removal order other than the specific terrorist statute,

22

1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize

23

indefinite detention.

24

labeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government

25

shall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it

It

That is the only

It says -- it has a paragraph

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

cannot remove except that if the Government determines -­

2

and -- and it appears to put the burden on the Government

3

-- that the person is a danger to national security or the

4

community, it can detain them for another 6 months.

5

then you -- you could have indefinite detention, but each

6

time, each 6 months, the statute provides for review.

7

So not only do the sneakers, the aliens who

And

8

cross across the border in the -- in the dark of night

9

from Mexico or wherever -- not only do they under the

10

Government's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so

11

too do terrorist aliens by statute.

12

by some implication Congress has intended to authorize the

13

indefinite detention of people that we thought we should

14

welcome into our country, even though we didn't have the

15

ability under our quota system and under our current

16

regulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no

17

rights against indefinite detention.

For the Government to -­

answer the Government's argument that this is necessary,

that the United States shouldn't effectively be punished

for being humanitarian, and if we can't hold these people,

23

if we're forced to let them in, then any rogue nation can

dump anyone it wants on the United States and we can't

stop it?

flooded our borders with illegal aliens who we could not

you say we can forcibly return them is literally we can

MR. MILLS:

That's one option.

If there -- if

the Cuban army is there to prevent us, you know, maybe it

would require some military action that the administration

10

might decide is not advisable.

One point that I'd like to make that I did not

Justice Scalia, you had a question yesterday in the Leocal

case, and it -- it raised an issue that I hadn't looked at

before on whether a statute can be interpreted differently

11

in a situation where the reason to interpret it is no

12

longer there.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what about the argument

5

that the statute, in effect, limits the -- our -- our

6

interpretation limits the -- the detention to a period

7

reasonably related to the Government's interest in

8

accomplishing that interest?

9

in -- in the case of -- of aliens who are excluded, if we

That interest is different

10

accept that class as distinct from all excludables.

11

-- and that may allow a much longer period of detention,

12

among other things, to deter dictators from -- from

13

dumping.

14

dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place.

15

That argument stops short of saying we can detain them for

16

life, but it would support the -- the position that on a

17

consistent interpretation of the statute, the Government

18

could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in

19

others.

20

And

You've given us an answer to what to do if they

What's your answer to that?
MR. MILLS:

My answer to that is that that might

21

be a -- a legislative policy decision to make that

22

distinction.

after they've been ordered removed.

and this was the Government's argument in Zadvydas.

There is only one class of

that's basically your answer.

MR. MILLS:

That is correct.

that it can revoke his release at any time for any reason

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Mills.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Justice Souter, you're exactly right in terms of

13

why the statutory construction or statutory application of

14

the terms in Zadvydas does not control here.

15

starting point -- again back to page 682 of its opinion,

16

it says, we deal here with aliens who were admitted.

17

way the Court dealt in the opinion was a matter of

18

statutory construction, and it did it by reading into the

19

statute a reasonable time limitation.

20

for aliens who -- who have been admitted and are subject

21

to what were called deportation is different from aliens

22

who were stopped at the border.

the Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's your -- what's your

5

answer to Mr. -- Mr. Mills' position that the Government

6

has, in fact, statutorily waived that distinction by

7

creating one class of excludables?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

respect, it has not.

It -- with respect -- with

And -- and if I could -- if I could

10

explain this.

11

held and in fact rejected a very similar argument.

12

rationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that

13

deportable aliens are subject to an express, not an

14

implied, 6-month limitation.

15

said the aliens in that -- the alien in that case, once he

16

couldn't be removed to another country, should be released

17

because the purpose of keeping him to return him to

18

another country was no longer being served.

19

rejected that argument, even though there was a statutory

20

express limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held

21

that an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did

22

not have to be released.

23

This -- going back to Mezei, this Court
The

And the court of appeals

This Court

In reliance on that decision, Congress passed

24

the parole statute to leave the release in -- excuse me -­

25

Mezei was after it, but the -- the executive branch has

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

relied on that rationale.

2

The Cuban review regulations that are at issue

3

here have been in place for 15 years under the parole

4

statute.

5

the -- this program was the subject of many hearings in

6

Congress.

7

Ninth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel

8

Cuban.

9

Congress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on

10

the longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent

11

hordes of aliens from coming into our country and to

12

impose an arbitrary 6-month limitation.

13

As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996,

There were cases -- the Barrera case out of the

It is implausible to believe in 1996, when

I -- I think there's no argument that if an

14

alien is detained before removal proceedings are begun,

15

that there is no 6-month limitation.

16

entirely up to the Attorney General under the parole

17

regulations.

18

once Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion

19

or now removal against an alien, the person is no longer

20

in an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says

21

you're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has

22

been formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6­

23

month limitation that did not apply up until '96 and

24

doesn't even apply until these -- to these aliens until

25

removal proceedings have been begun.

His release is

It's -- it's implausible to believe that

So the right way to look at this statute as

2

what's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into

3

account that historic background of the United States

4

being able to protect its borders.

5

indication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule

6

this longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has

7

operated, as I said, for 15 years.
