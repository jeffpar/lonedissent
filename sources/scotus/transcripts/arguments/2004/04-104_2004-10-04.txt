ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

This case, and these cases, concern the

13

constitutionality of the twelve hundred criminal

14

sentencings that take place in Federal court each

15

week.

16

understanding of the relationship between the

17

Guidelines, and the statutory maximum penalties

18

set forth in the United States Code, an

19

understanding reflected in a series of this

20

Court's decisions dealing with the Guidelines,

21

than the constitutionality of those criminal

22

sentencings remains secure.

23

If this Court re-affirms its traditional

On the other hand, if this Court takes a

24

different view, and treats the outer bounds of the

25

Guideline ranges as if they were statutory

4

1

maximums, then the majority of those criminal

2

sentencings become constitutionally dubious, and

3

this Court must confront difficult remedial

4

issues.

5

This is, of course, not the first time

6

that this Court has confronted a challenge to the

7

constitutionality of the Guidelines or to the

8

Commission.

9

this Court has never considered the precise Sixth

To be sure, in those previous cases,

10

Amendment issue before the Court today.

But,

11

nonetheless, those previous cases are instructive,

12

because all of those cases, Dunnigan, Witte,

13

Watts, and Edwards, all reflect a particular

14

understanding of the relationship between the

15

Guidelines and the statutory maximum sentences for

16

each specific crime defined in the United States

17

Code.

18

statutory maximum in the Code is the relevant

19

focal point for constitutional analysis.

And all of those decisions suggest that the

20

So, in the Witte case, for example, the

21

finding of relevant conduct in the Witte case increased

22

his sentence under the Guidelines by two hundred

23

months.

24

double jeopardy challenge before the Court by

25

emphasizing that that consideration of relevant

Nonetheless, this Court rejected the

5

1

conduct did not increase his penalty beyond the

2

statutory maximum.

3

Likewise in the Edwards case, this Court

4

considered the propriety of a judicial finding of

5

crack cocaine that increased the Guideline

6

sentence, when the jury was instructed in the

7

alternative, to find cocaine or crack.

8

though the judicial finding had the effect of

9

raising the punishment under the Guidelines, this

Now, even

10

Court found no serious Sixth Amendment issue

11

raised precisely because the effect of the judge's

12

finding did not take the sentence beyond the

13

maximum for a cocaine-only conspiracy.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you say we found no

15

serious Sixth Amendment issue raised.

16

right of jury trial issue argued in that case, and

17

decided?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Was the

In the Edwards case, a Sixth

19

Amendment issue and, I think, fairly including the

20

jury trial, was raised in that case.

21

to go back and look briefs in that case and I have

22

to admit, they're a little difficult to get

23

through in terms of the precise issue that was

24

being raised.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, I've tried

The right to jury trial

6

1

is fairly clear and stark, and I just don't

2

recall that being argued in any of those cases.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it was argued, I

4

think, fairly clearly in the Watts case, I mean,

5

there was a section -- Watts, of course, was a

6

summary reversal, so you have to go and look at

7

the brief in opposition in the Watts case.

8

you do, there's a separate paragraph in the

9

argument section denominated the jury trial

10
11

And if

right.
And I think in some respects, the Watts

12

case is a particularly clear indicator that this

13

Court has rejected the view of the Guidelines that

14

Respondents embrace.

15

quite prophetic in his dissent in that case.

16

embraced the precise understanding of the

17

significance of the outer bound of the Guidelines

18

range in his Watts dissent, and no member of this

19

Court joined that dissent, and no member found the

20

disposition with respect to Watts

21
22
23

Because Justice Stevens was

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He

That just proves they

don't listen to me as much as they should.
MR. CLEMENT:

It may very well prove that,

24

Justice Stevens, because you were very clear about

25

the point, just to remind you, in the Watts case

7

1

there were two cases before the Court, there was

2

the Putra case, and there was the Watts case, they

3

were consolidated.

4

can envision that case, or characterize that case

5

as being sort of a collateral estoppel, double

6

jeopardy case, but as you correctly recognized,

7

very clearly, in your Watts dissent, with respect

8

to Mr. Watts, the finding, the criminal finding of

9

acquittal was based on 924(c), which requires use

And with respect to Putra, you

10

of a gun.

11

based on an enhancing factor that only requires

12

possession of a gun.

13

collateral estoppel effect in that case.

14

The sentencing enhancement was done

So there wasn't any

But, nonetheless, in your dissent you

15

pointed out, in footnotes 2 and 4 that it still

16

had the effect of raising his sentence above the

17

outer bound of the Guidelines range, and that,

18

because that was done on the basis of a

19

preponderance of the evidence, rather than a

20

beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that that

21

raised a constitutional problem, and you would

22

have reversed.

23

summarily reverse in that case.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

The rest of the Court was happy to

Mr. Clement, here's the

problem I have with the Government's argument

8

1

insofar as it does not urge that we reverse

2

Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as

3

well.

4

to me you have a cure that doesn't correspond to

5

the disease.

6

jury trial does not apply here is because, after

7

all, these sentences have not been prescribed, or

8

these maximums have not been prescribed by the

9

legislature, but rather, have been prescribed by a

10

But assuming we adhere to Blakely, it seems

You say that the reason the right to

quasi-judicial agency.

11

But the right of jury trial is meant to

12

protect against whom?

13

when you say, "I want to be tried by a jury."

14

You're not worried about the legislature, you're

15

worried about the judges, precisely.

16

care if the upper level of the Guidelines were

17

actually prescribed by a court, as opposed to the

18

Commission which is, I don't know what it is, but

19

it's not a court.

20

Who are you worried about

So I don't

But even if it were prescribed by a court,

21

how would that eliminate the jury trial problem?

22

The whole reason for jury trial is we don't trust

23

judges.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

Scalia, I'd like to make two observations.

9

One, I

1

don't think the jury trial right is just a

2

juxtaposition of the role of the jury versus the

3

role of the judge, because if that were the only

4

factor at issue in this Court's Sixth Amendment

5

jurisprudence, it would be very difficult to

6

explain why it is that judicial fact-finding can

7

have the effects that it can under a purely

8

discretionary system, yet this Court has upheld

9

that time and time again.

10

The second point I'd like to make, is I do

11

think that this Court's Apprendi to Blakely line

12

of cases

13

­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we just go back to

14

the point you just made, it's a little different

15

when the judge has discretion and there's no -­

16

the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of

17

things into account, but they're not quantified.

18

And I think that was dramatically illustrated, the

19

difference, by the decision of Judge Lynch when he

20

said, "Well, I'll go back to the old ways of doing

21

it, I'll look at the Guidelines for some advice,"

22

he comes out with twenty-four months instead of

23

thirty-three months.

24
25

So I think there is a huge difference
between a judge taking account of many, many

10

1

factors, not giving them a specific quantity as

2

the Guidelines require.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

4

think there -- there certainly is a difference

5

between sentencing under the Guidelines, versus a

6

system of discretionary sentencing, or even a

7

system of discretionary sentencing where the

8

Guidelines have an advisory character, I'd

9

certainly concede that.

10

My point was, though, in making a

11

distinction between the role of the jury and the

12

judge, it's not just as simple as saying that the

13

jury trial right exists precisely to protect the

14

jury from the judge, because if that were the

15

case, the kind of fact-finding that Judge Lynch

16

engaged in, or the kind of fact finding that was

17

commonplace under discretionary sentencing also

18

takes roles away from the jury, and gives them to

19

the judge.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but we're talking

21

here about one precise role of the judge or of the

22

jury, and that is, to find a fact that is

23

necessary to keep you in jail for an additional

24

number of years.

25

discretionary sentencing is if it's, you know, ten

And the difference with

11

1

to twenty years, what you know when you do the

2

crime is that you've laid yourself open to twenty

3

years.

4

Now, if you get a merciful judge, good for

5

you, I mean, that's lagniappe as they say in

6

Louisiana, but if you get a hanging judge, you've

7

got twenty years, and you know that when you

8

commit the crime, whereas we have a system now

9

where you are entitled to no more than so much. And I

10

find it just incompatible with jury trial right

11

to say that that fact must be determined, before

12

you can be kept in jail.

13

it be determined by a judge.

14

resemblance to the discretionary sentencing

15

system.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

And yet we're going let
That bears no

With respect, Justice

17

Scalia, I think you've built in some assumptions

18

into that question, because under our system,

19

generally speaking if somebody wants to know what

20

the maximum exposure for a particular criminal

21

offense is, they would be well-advised to look at

22

the U.S. Code provision that specifies what the

23

maximum sentence is for that offense, because that

24

is their exposure, that's what they're told about

25

in their Rule 11 colloquy if they plead to the

12

1

crime, and if the judge makes certain findings, to

2

be sure, upward departure, whatever it takes in a

3

particular case, that is the maximum exposure that

4

the individual

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not the maximum

6

exposure.

If, for example, one of the factors is

7

whether the crime was committed with a firearm, I

8

know that if I don't use a firearm, under the

9

Guidelines, I can only get so many years, so

10

somebody has to find that I used a firearm, and if

11

I didn't, my maximum exposure is less.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Unless the judge departs for

13

some other reason, or the like.

14

that's true -

15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or he makes a
mistake in finding.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

there really wasn't one.

20

I mean, but certainly

MR. CLEMENT:

I suppose that's true, too.
He finds a gun when

So there are different ways

21

that you could get that sentence under the

22

Guidelines system.

23

no departure on some other grounds, we both

24

understand, I think, how the Guidelines work and

25

you're describing it correctly.

But if there's no mistake, and

13

But still, that

1

is a finding that is only necessary because of the

2

determination of the Commission and the

3

Guidelines, and that brings us back to the

4

question -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the

6

determination, as is occasionally true of the

7

Guidelines, is made not by the Commission, but by

8

Congress itself?

9

direction of Congress?

Or made by the Commission at the
Then the distinction that

10

you're making between the maximum set by the

11

legislature and the guidance provided, or the

12

guidance to discretion under the Guidelines,

13

really doesn't stand up.

14

extent that Congress directly enacts Guidelines,

15

would you concede that then, the critical finding

16

has to be made by the jury?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

So at least to the

I would not concede that,

18

Justice Ginsburg, but let me first make clear that

19

in the case before us today, the Guidelines that

20

we have are promulgated by the Commission, and

21

were not the direct or indirect result of a

22

Congressional act the way that the, say, the

23

Protect Act added particular amendments to the

24

Guidelines, so that question is not directly posed

25

in this case.

14

1

The reason I would say that even in that

2

case there is a difference is because it is still

3

different when Congress goes in and amends a

4

particular Guideline in a sense in a sea of

5

Guidelines provided by the Commission.

6

think that's true, one, because amending a single

7

Guideline doesn't change the overall character of

8

the Guidelines.

9

And I

But also because, when Congress decides to

10

take action not as a statute, but as an amendment

11

to a Guideline, it doesn't change the fundamental

12

character of the Guideline as a Guideline.

13

after -- the Protect Act for example, specifies a

14

period in which -- after which the Commission can

15

then amend that Guideline.

16

a case that you can have with a statute consistent

17

with the Presentment Clause.

18

And so

Which is obviously not

And to just give you another example, the

19

Sentencing Reform Act that has brought us here

20

today, one of the things it did was make specific

21

amendments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure

22

32.

23

make Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 a

24

statute, it continues to be a Federal Rule, the

25

Federal Rules Advisory Committee could still modify

I think when Congress does that, it doesn't

15

1

it after the fact, and so I think even in that

2

case, there's a difference in effect.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What is the difference in

4

effect?

I mean, that's where I'm having trouble,

5

and I guess others are having trouble.

6

there's a difference in process, there may be a

7

difference, in some sense, in ultimate status, but

8

there isn't, it seems to me, any difference in

9

effect.

Yes,

The defendant in the courtroom is going

10

to suffer the same effect either necessitated or

11

sufficed by this fact which is just as crucial,

12

whether it's a rule, whether it's a guideline,

13

whether it's a statute, why should that make any

14

difference for the Sixth Amendment?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it should make -­

16

well, I guess what I would respond to that,

17

Justice Souter, is this.

18

that emerges from this Court's recent Sixth

19

Amendment jurisprudence, is that the impact on the

20

defendant himself or herself is not the only test

21

that this Court looks to.

22

perspective of an individual defendant, they don't

23

care if they've gotten five extra years because a

24

judge made a finding under a discretionary regime,

25

or they got five extra years because the judge

I think that one thing

Because from the

16

1

made a finding that the legislature told the judge

2

to make, the practical effect is the same.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the practical

4

effect is the same but in the moment before either

5

in theory they commit the crime or in the moment

6

before the trial is over or in the moment before

7

the sentence comes down, there is one big

8

difference in the two classes of cases.

9

defendant is entitled to claim that he can not be

The

10

sentenced to the higher range unless a fact is

11

found.

12

range, within that range, he can not make that

13

claim, he can not make that assumption, and the -­

14

that, it seems to me, is the point at which the

15

jury trial right has got to focus.

16

In a case of discretionary sentencing

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think again, as

17

Justice Stevens suggested earlier, I mean, that

18

may be true if you focus in on that single fact

19

under the Guideline system, but under the myriad

20

of various ways that your Guidelines sentence can

21

go up or down, it may be inappropriate under the

22

Federal Guideline system to focus in on the point

23

of analysis on that particular interval, of just

24

the one -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why not?

17

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Because, again, as a

2

defendant, you may have a case where there are

3

five or six potential enhancements, and there are

4

five or six potential departures, and your

5

sentence is going to be a product of the judicial

6

fact finding that goes in, in making those various

7

conclusions -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And each one is

appealable separately, each one is appealable

10

separately, it's a separate legal finding.

11

the judge doesn't, in discretionary sentencing, he

12

doesn't have to make any factual finding, he can

13

just look at you and say, "I think you're a bad

14

actor, you've got forty years."

15

here where the judge must make factual findings,

16

and each one is appealable if he's made them

17

incorrectly.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

And

We have a system

I don't disagree with that

19

characterization of the Guidelines, but I still

20

think that is a difference from a pure

21

statutory scheme, it's different from a scheme

22

like this Court had before it in Blakely against

23

Washington, where the statute focuses you in on

24

just a couple of factors and you really can re­

25

conceptualize that regime as providing for a base

18

1

offense level and one or two aggravated grades of

2

the offense.

3

that we quoted on page four of our reply brief, you

4

really can't re-conceptualize the Guideline system

5

that way.

6

As Judge Lynch observed in language

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the principal

7

reason you can't, or I think the principle reason

8

that you're advancing is, that the Guideline

9

system is so complicated.

There are a myriad of

10

factors.

11

one in that myriad subject to the same claim?

12

Surely, the argument can't be just because it's

13

more complicated, that the Sixth Amendment

14

evaporates.

15

As Justice Scalia says, why isn't each

MR. CLEMENT:

I agree, Justice Souter, and

16

the point isn't that it's more complicated.

17

just continue with Judge Lynch's observation,

18

which, as I say, is quoted on page four of our

19

reply brief, it's not just that it's complicated,

20

it's that the mission of the Guidelines system is,

21

once, assuming that somebody's been convicted of

22

some Federal crime with certain elements defined

23

by Congress, then, what the Guidelines ask the

24

judge to do is evaluate the incident of criminal

25

activity and assess an appropriate punishment

19

If I

1

without regard to whether it has met the certain

2

elements of a particular Federal crime.

3

the really, the focus is quite different, and in

4

that sense, I think there is, there is more than a

5

difference of form between a set of guidelines

6

produced by a

7

produced by the sentencing commission.

8
9

And so,

legislature and a set of guidelines

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I find very little

difference between telling him to evaluate it with

10

regard to particular elements of a crime and

11

asking him to evaluate it with regard to

12

particular sentencing facts.

13

same.

14

light of certain facts that he has to find.

15

Whether you call them the one or the other, he's

16

doing the same thing.

17

get three more years; if he doesn't find it, you

18

don't.

19

outcome is concerned, what difference does it make

20

whether you call it an "element" or a "required

21

fact for sentencing"?

22

The result is the

You're asking him to evaluate it in

If he finds this fact you

I mean, you know, as far as the real

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think there are

23

differences between the two. I think if you look

24

at the Washington system that you had before you

25

in the Blakely case, it was a product of the

20

1

legislature, and so, not surprisingly, there was a

2

focus on the crimes as defined by the legislature,

3

there was a presumptive range for each crime, and

4

then there were a handful of things that got you

5

into

6

then there was basically the upward departure

7

authority or the downward departure authority, and

8

that was it.

9

is going to be predominantly focused on the

10
11

- added three years, like a firearm, and

And that makes sense; a legislature

statutorily defined crimes.
In the context of the Guidelines, on the

12

other hand, it is a much more widely variant

13

focused, and what it's focusing on is the criminal

14

activity as a whole.

15

can increase it, there's many factors that can

16

decrease it, and

17

There are many factors that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that complexity, is

18

the key or, suppose these Guidelines were proposed

19

by the Commission, just as they are, with all

20

their complexity, but they were proposed as

21

legislation, and then Congress enacted these

22

Guidelines, would you be able to make the argument

23

that you're making, still?

24

now legislative guidelines is viable after

25

Blakely?

21

The Federal system,

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think so.

I think

2

in that, in that context we would be limited to an

3

argument to asking this Court to overrule Blakely.

4

But that is not to say that, that, what I want to

5

make the point, though, is ultimately if pushed ­

6

and your hypothetical pushes us - if pushed, the

7

argument is one of form, that the fact that these

8

emanate from the sentencing commission makes a

9

constitutional difference.

But I don't want to

10

lose the fact in making that concession that there

11

is still a real difference between the way the

12

Federal Guidelines work and the way the Washington

13

Guidelines work, and the Federal Guidelines work

14

exactly as you would expect: sentencing guidelines

15

promulgated by an entity located in the Article

16

III branch, and consisting of Article III members;

17

and the Washington Guidelines system works

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not so clear

19

anymore, it just happens that there are three

20

members, but they don't have to be any judicial

21

members, under the current legislation.

22
23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

That's true, Justice

Ginsburg, but there
JUSTICE SCALIA:They're still in the
judicial branch, right?

22

1

MR. CLEMENT: Still in the judicial

2

branch, Justice Scalia, and there are the same

3

number of judicial members on the Commission now

4

as there were when this Court considered the

5

Mistretta decision.

6

recognized that you could have bodies located in

7

the judicial branch that were auxiliary to the

8

judicial branch, even if they consisted, quote,

9

"solely of non-judges."

10

And I think Mistretta itself

So I don't think that's what's

11

dispositive.

12

ultimately is what this Court recognized in the

13

Mistretta decision.

14

this Court made clear that the Commission was

15

constitutionally located in the Article III branch

16

precisely because it did not take on the

17

quintessentially legislative tasks of setting

18

maximum punishments and defining the elements of

19

Federal crimes.

20

I think what's dispositive

In the Mistretta decision,

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mistretta

21

might have come out the other way had it not been

22

for that observation.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's exactly

24

right, Mr. Chief Justice.

And I can talk more

25

about that in terms of the severability issue,

23

1

which is question two.

2

you get to the point where prospectively the

3

proposal is to treat sentencing enhancement

4

factors under the Guidelines exactly as if they're

5

elements of Federal crimes, they would have to be

6

included in indictments and have to be charged to

7

the jury on beyond a reasonable doubt.

8
9

But I think especially if

Then I don't see how Mistretta survives
anymore or at least how Mistretta allows that

10

particular judicial remedy to go forward.

11

at that point, you've really had the Commission

12

become transformed into precisely what this Court

13

said it wasn't, as a matter of constitutional law,

14

in the Mistretta case.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because

The paradigm that the

16

cases discuss in Blakely and in the cases

17

leading up to it from Apprendi, are facts such as

18

the amount of drugs, was there a weapon, was there

19

violence performed against the victim.

20

Court finds that these are so much like an element

21

that they have to be proved, and adheres to its

22

jurisprudence and invalidates the Guidelines to

23

that effect, is there any argument that either the

24

Government makes or that some of the commentators

25

would make, that there are other kinds of

24

And if the

1

sentencing considerations that can be called

2

factual, to be sure, but that should be the

3

judge: say, lack of remorse as demonstrated after

4

the verdict; the fact that after the verdict,

5

investigation shows that of the two defendants,

6

one was the real ringleader, streetwise, the other

7

was kind of a naive dupe; or that there was a

8

failure to cooperate with the person presenting

9

the -- preparing the sentencing report.

10

These are facts in a certain way.

Is it

11

for a penny, in for a pound?

12

all of these as factual, or is there any progress

13

to be made in trying

14

some facts that are, are like elements and some

15

that are not.

16

number of cases, I suppose, to elaborate that.

17

Do we have to treat

to see if there are some,

That would be a -- it would take a

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy, I think

18

that the thrust of respondents' position -- they

19

can obviously speak for themselves to this point,

20

but I think the thrust of their position is in for

21

a penny, in for a pound, that if you extend

22

Blakely to the guidelines, then that's it, the

23

guidelines go out.

24

accepting the Government's position here, that the

25

guidelines are different, would not foreclose the

I think the consequence of

25

1

possibility for a more fine-tuned analysis that

2

focused on the particular effects of particular

3

guidelines ranges, or the particularly enhancing

4

factors and the like.

5

And I think one thing that ought to give

6

the Court caution before it extends Blakely all

7

the way to the guidelines is, if you look at the

8

guidelines, there are certainly some enhancing

9

factors or some factors that increase punishment

10

under the guidelines, that look nothing like any

11

traditional element of any crime.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What, what, what tests

13

would you propose, or the commentators? How do we

14

distinguish the permitted kind of fact that the

15

judge can find, and those that must be for the

16

jury?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, two things,

18

Justice Kennedy.

I don't want to get too far

19

afield in the sense that we think that for

20

purposes of this case, the Court could distinguish

21

the guidelines and could still maintain the very

22

bright line of Blakely as applies to legislative

23

enactments.

24

either, with respect to legislative enactments or

25

in the particular field of the guidelines, try to

But if this Court were going to

26

1

develop another test to differentiate elements

2

from - I'm sorry, elements from

3

factors, I think this Court could get guidance in

4

the same kind of analysis that it's done in the

5

context of affirmative defenses.

6

sentencing

As Apprendi itself recognized, in the

7

Patterson case, this Court decided that in that

8

context, it would not adopt one bright line or

9

another and just give up the enterprise of drawing

10

lines in between.

11

enterprise could be done under the guise of

12

dealing with the guidelines.

13

thrust of the Government's position here today is

14

that you shouldn't accept the Respondent's

15

particular challenge to the guidelines because

16

that does have the effect of "in for a penny, in

17

for a pound," and wiping the guidelines out.

18

And I think a similar

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think the

Mr. Clement, following

19

up on Justice Kennedy's thought, if we adhere to

20

the strict language in Apprendi itself, as quoted

21

below, any - solely on the fact reflected in the

22

jury verdict or the plea of the plea bargain, that's - that

23

establishes the maximum.

24

total number of sentences that are imposed in the,

25

by the Federal system today would violate that

What percent of the

27

1

rule?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, let

3

me try to answer it as best as I can.

4

make the observation, though, that the only

5

estimate I can give you is based on retrospective

6

data, obviously, and it could be ­

7

I want to

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let's look at the

8

future and assume that in 97 percent of the cases

9

which are plea bargains, you could agree on what

10

the relevant facts are.

11

done.

12

is my impression that a very small number of those

13

actually involve violations of the Apprendi rule.

14

Is that correct?

15

That certainly could be

And in the 3 percent that are trialed, it

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not sure that's right,

16

Justice Stevens.

17

because I can only answer it based on the data I

18

have.

19

Let me answer it this way,

JUSTICE STEVENS: See, it's relevant

20

because underlying all this is a question do the

21

guidelines fail in toto, or do they only fail with

22

respect to those relatively small number of cases in

23

which there's a violation of the Apprendi rule?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

I understand, and let me

answer it this way, which is looking

28

1

retrospectively at the data from 2002.

2

consider all the cases that either went to trial

3

or pled and that, they're not differentiated, the

4

two aren't differentiated, then about 65 percent

5

of the cases raise a potential Blakely or Apprendi

6

type issue, so that would be the starting point

7

for the analysis.

8
9

If you

Now, as you pointed -

JUSTICE STEVENS: In raising the issue, it
depends on what - the issue you describe.

A lot

10

of people describe it as an issue when you just

11

use the guidelines at all.

12

issue, involve it in a sentence over and above the

13

amount that would be authorized by either the jury

14

verdict or the plea bargain?

Do they raise an

15

MR. CLEMENT: Yes, that's 65 -

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Do you think 65 percent of the

cases do?
MR. CLEMENT:

The numbers that we have is

19

65 percent.

Basically, you have 44 percent of the

20

cases involve some chapter II or chapter III

21

enhancement or adjustment to the base level.

22

then we've kind of looked, in addition to the 44

23

percent, we've looked at the drug cases, which by

24

the nature of the drug sentencing table, virtually

25

all of the drug cases, if they don't implicate a

29

And

1

mandatory minimum, involve a potential Blakely

2

upward adjustment.

3

looking at these numbers, is to basically take all

4

the drug cases and then subtract that

5

And so what we've done is, in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They all, of course,

6

involve a potential upward adjustment.

7

they all involve actual sentences above the amount

8

that the jury verdict would have authorized?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

But do

Well, again, Justice

10

Stevens, I don't know, because that comes to a

11

second question, which is, if I understand your

12

question, which is, we know that 65 percent of the

13

cases raise a potentially, a potential

14

issue.

15

of the cases settle, is there a way to sort of

16

waive Blakely rights and the like, and make this

17

workable going forward?

18

what the, what, what system will emerge.

19

Blakely

Then the question is, well, if 97 percent

And it's hard to know

JUSTICE STEVENS: The thing that -- I'm

20

sorry, but I really, it's important to me.

21

Raising an issue, the issue is always raised when

22

there's a possibility of a higher sentence, but I

23

don't think it's fair to assume that that 65 percent of

24

the sentences of tried cases actually resulted in

25

sentences higher than what the jury verdict would

30

1
2
3
4

have authorized.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, again, I can only give

you the numbers JUSTICE STEVENS: It's potentially that

5

every case does. But if in fact, most sentences

6

come within the maximum anyway, it's of course a

7

serious problem in those cases, but system-wide,

8

it's not nearly the problem that the figures

9

you've mentioned suggest.

10

MR. CLEMENT: Again, Justice Stevens, I

11

want to answer as best I can.

The figures I have

12

suggest that 65 percent of the cases do involve an

13

upward adjustment of some kind. And so there is a

14

Blakely problem.

15

is, all right, 65 percent of cases in the

16

world where nobody thought Blakely was a problem

17

for the guidelines involve those kind of upward

18

adjustments.

19

agreements and the like to have people waive their

20

Blakely rights in certain ways that may make the

21

system work a little bit better or deal with a

22

slightly reduced number of cases.

23

way you slice this, this is going to have a

24

tremendous impact on the reality of criminal

25

sentencing in the Federal system.

So the only real question

There may be ways through plea

31

But I think any

1

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as to past. I mean,

2

it may have a significant one-shot impact with

3

respect to cases that were decided without Blakely

4

in mind.

5

agree with you that changes could make some

6

reduction.

7

findings whenever, whenever there's a need for a

8

higher sentence based on facts.

9

what is the problem with that?

10

But for the future, I, I just don't

I think changes could provide for jury

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't know;

Well, I, well let me try to

11

address the remedial question then going forward.

12

If this Court were to find that Blakely is fully

13

applicable to the guidelines, then that's going to

14

raise some very serious and complex remedial

15

questions.

16

be clear, is that one option that shouldn't be on

17

the table is the idea that on a prospective basis,

18

the guidelines are severable in a way that makes

19

all enhancements or all upward adjustments

20

completely unavailable, and all downward

21

departures fully available.

22

is obviously nothing that Congress intended.

23

One question, though, I think ought to

Because that system

Now Respondents, for their part, don't

24

propose that rule, although they want to benefit

25

from effectively that rule for their own cases.

32

1

What they suggest is that on a going-forward

2

basis, you could include the sentencing enhancing

3

factors as, in the indictment and then send them

4

to the jury as effectively de facto elements of

5

the crime to be found by the jury beyond a

6

reasonable doubt.

7

so-called Blakely-ization of the guidelines

8

creates an enormous amount of judicial lawmaking

9

and raises very serious separation of powers

10

Now with respect, I think that

problems.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What is, what is the

12

lawmaking part?

13

I have -- let's put the question this way.

14

Congress has authorized the Commission and the

15

Commission has said, "If fact X is found, then the

16

range is higher."

17

concluding that Congress and the Commission would

18

have preferred that range to be higher regardless of

19

whether a jury found the fact or a judge found the

20

fact?

21

me.

22

in terms of judicial lawmaking, it doesn't seem

23

like much to me.

24
25

I mean, if I have a choice -- if

Is there a lot of lawmaking in

That doesn't seem like much of a stretch to
There may be other reasons not to do it.

MR. CLEMENT:

But

Well, with respect, Justice

Souter, I think it is fairly ambitious judicial

33

1

lawmaking.

2

of text to get the sentencing judge effectively

3

out of the business of fact-finding.

4
5

You do have to take out a fair amount

JUSTICE SCALIA: What text do you have to
take out?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

You have to take out the

7

reference in 3553(b), that talks about what the

8

court finds, and then it makes a definite

9

reference to the court needing to find things in

10

order to have upward and downward departures.

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

mean by the "court," doesn't it?

13
14

It depends on what you

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just consider the word
court to mean jury.

Jury or a judge.

15

MR. CLEMENT: And I think then ­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which - which is sometimes

17

done, there are statutes that refer to the court,

18

that -

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And as we point out in our

20

brief, there are plenty of statutes that refer to

21

the court in distinction from the jury.

22

then if you look at 3742(e), which is the appeal

23

right, if you look at 3742(e), makes it quite

24

clear that on appeal, courts of appeals are

25

supposed to defer to the, to the fact, the facts

34

I think

1

found by the district court.

Now I think in the

2

context of the overall provision for judicial

3

review, that is clearly a reference to the

4

judge, not to the jury.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me, when

6

there is an ambiguity that construed one way

7

creates a constitutional statute and construed

8

another way creates an unconstitutional one, it's

9

an easy call.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, with respect, I don't

11

think there's any way to avoid a potentially

12

unconstitutional system going forward, because if

13

you treat these guideline factors that were

14

clearly created by the Commission and in some

15

cases created by Congress, on the assumption that

16

they would be used for judge fact-finding, and

17

then send them to the jury, then what you've done

18

prospectively -- it's one thing -- let me put it

19

this way.

20

guideline factors that are enhancements have the

21

effect of increasing sentences and operate like

22

elements of crimes for retrospective

23

constitutional analysis, for finding a Sixth

24

Amendment problem, but it is quite another thing

25

to prospectively treat those factors exactly as if

It's one thing to recognize that the

35

1

they're elements of crimes, force them to be

2

included in the indictment, send them to the jury

3

beyond a reasonable doubt.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS: It just means that if a

5

different procedure is followed, you'll reach

6

precisely the same sentences the guidelines

7

reached.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I actually don't think

that follows, Justice Stevens, because I think

10

taking guidelines that were clearly designed for

11

judge fact finding and sending them to the jury --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think judges reach

13

different results on factual issues than juries

14

do?

15

Is that part of your submission?
MR. CLEMENT:

No.

What my submission is,

16

is that taking guidelines that were designed for

17

judge fact finding and sending them and using them

18

for jury fact finding is going to have a very

19

disproportionate impact on some cases.

20

give you an example if I could, to make the point.

21

If you think of two fraud cases that under the

22

guidelines

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me

But keep it simple

24

because we're assuming that in most cases, there

25

aren't a host of factors but usually just two or

36

1

three, such as the drug quantity and did he find a

2

gun.

3

fact to identify, would it make any difference in

4

the ultimate sentence that's imposed whether the

5

jury finds it or the judge finds it?

6

Now in those where there's a fairly simple

MR. CLEMENT:

7

Stevens.

8

simple fraud example.

9

I think it would, Justice

And if I could -- I'll keep it a very

JUSTICE STEVENS: Keep to that example

10

I've given you.

11

Why would it make a difference?

12
13

The gun and the drug quantity.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it might not make as much

a difference in the drug case --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it make any difference?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

it could make a difference,

17

if I could use the fraud example.

Well, here's how

18
19

MR. CLEMENT: And then you may be able to

20

see how it could or could not relate to the

21

marijuana example or a drug example.

22

context of a fraud case, two fraud cases that are

23

sentenced the exact same way and treated as

24

uniform and proportional under the current system

25

JUSTICE STEVENS: And there's a difference

37

In the

1

in sentence depending on the amount of

2

money that the fraud involved.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

In the number of victims.

4

And what you'll have is -- if you think of one

5

fraud that involved one victim and a slightly

6

higher amount of money, and another fraud that

7

involved many victims and a slightly lower amount

8

of money, the current guideline system basically

9

tries to treat them the same.

10

Now with a single fraud victim, the idea

11

of Blakely-izing the guidelines may be relatively

12

straightforward.

13

the indictment.

14

with the amount of loss on it.

15

that one witness, and you can prove up your case

16

beyond a reasonable doubt.

You include the loss amount in
You put a special verdict form
And you call in

17

But if you have a case of telemarketing --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In that case -- let's

19

take them one at a time.

In that case, would it

20

make any difference whether the jury made the

21

finding or the judge made the finding?

22
23

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think it would,

Justice Stevens.

24

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

25

MR. CLEMENT: But that's what, what I want

38

Then what

1

to contrast it is with

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS: Now can you give me a
case in which it would make a difference?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

Imagine that you have

5

a telemarketing fraud where a thousand peoples -­

6

a thousand individuals have been milked out of a

7

couple of dollars each.

8

system, proving up the fraud amount for the judge

9

is not that difficult because you can get the

Now under the current

10

probation officer to testify, or some other way to

11

get the total amount of the fraud in front of the

12

judge.

13

you're going to have to call in every one of 2,000

14

individuals who was defrauded.

15

it's going to be very difficult to prove that

16

fraud amount in front of the jury beyond a

17

reasonable doubt.

18

the disproportionate and disuniform effects

19

Under the system that Respondents propose,

Otherwise, I think

And that just is one example of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You don't think a very

20

large fraud such as you've described could be

21

proved through two or three witnesses?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS: They used the Internet

24
25

I think it would be very

and they had all said -- I am not persuaded.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I suppose ­

39

1

JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it can't be, maybe

2

the judges shouldn't go, be going around guessing

3

how many people have been defrauded.

4

saying "more likely than not, on the basis of the

5

kind of evidence we usually don't accept in

6

criminal trials."

7

understand it.

8
9

Why is that okay?

Or you know,

I don't

MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, I think whatever
else is true, what you would be doing with such a

10

system is you'd be taking factors that I think

11

everyone concedes were designed by a Commission

12

that was upheld as constitutional precisely

13

because it did not have the effect of creating new

14

Federal crimes and statutory limits.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't make me feel

16

any good if I spend another 10 years in jail

17

because of it. Say, "Oh, well, don't worry about

18

it, it wasn't an element of the crime, after all."

19

[Laughter.]

20

MR. CLEMENT: No, I understand that,

21

Justice Scalia.

22

remedial question, though.

23

I'm trying to talk about the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

- about practical

40

1

experience in that regard.

I understand the

2

Department of Justice has told prosecutors that

3

now you allege these sentencing enhancers -- like

4

drug quantity, like amount of property stolen -­

5

you allege them in the indictment, you prove them

6

beyond a reasonable doubt.

7

intractably difficult in cases where it has been

8

attempted?

Has that proved

9

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

10

think we don't have enough experience to know.

11

think I can tell you one thing:

12

of enhancements, putting something in the

13

indictment is not necessarily the difficult step.

14

There are some things like relevant conduct that

15

can be very challenging to try to formulate in an

16

indictment.

17

enhance a sentence, it's relatively easy to put it

18

in the indictment itself.

19

that with a lot

But for a lot of the factors that

I think the trickier difficulties come up

20

in terms of trying to instruct the jury,

21

especially in cases where there are multiple

22

enhancements.

23

I

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well certainly

24

in the case of, say, perjury at trial, you

25

couldn't possibly allege that in the indictment

41

1
2
3
4

because you won't know.
MR. CLEMENT:
Chief Justice.

That's completely right, Mr.

And those cases are just out.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They're not out. They've got

5

to be separately prosecuted.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

And that's never been the

7

under -- I mean, that's true, there may be some

8

cases that you could bring a separate perjury

9

prosecution, but this court

10
11
12

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't know of any
case in which you can't.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there may be

13

situations where there's an obstruction of justice

14

that wouldn't necessarily make out all the

15

elements of a perjury prosecution.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I guess, we ought

17

to have an obstruction of justice crime with

18

defined elements that can be prosecuted.

19

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, with

20

respect, I mean, this Court, both before the

21

guidelines and after the guidelines, rejected the

22

argument that the only way to enhance a sentence

23

for obstruction of justice was to bring a separate

24

perjury prosecution.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I, I would, I would

42

1

take the same position today, unless you were

2

going to define it, in terms of a condition that

3

is both necessary and sufficient to expand the

4

sentencing range of the crime that you are

5

nominally prosecuting the person for.

6

that's the rub.

7

MR. CLEMENT: But that's

8

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me go -­

9

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean,

That's what this Court had

10

before it in Dunnigan.

11

that was not problematic.

12

during the trial.

13

reliance on Grayson, a pre-guidelines case, and

14

this Court said that the additional rigor and

15

predictability instilled by the guidelines did not

16

make a constitutional difference.

17

And this Court said that
It was obstruction

And this Court upheld it on

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've listed four

18

categories of things that you think would be very

19

difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not

20

to a judge at sentencing.

21

amount of information now and prior to guidelines

22

that were contained in the presentence report.

23

That information, most of which was used since

24

history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is

25

simply not available until the trial is over.

The first is the vast

43

1

The second happens to be the things that

2

the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial,

3

such as perjury.

4

The third sort of thing are those things

5

that just get too complicated when you try to list

6

15 in

7

together -- victim, brandishing the gun, et

8

cetera.

9

indictment, such as victim -- put them all

And the fourth kind of thing are the

10

things that are too difficult to explain to a

11

jury.

12

jury, and if you can do that one, which may be

13

easy, try the multiple-count rules.

14
15
16

Try explaining even "brandishing" to a

All right.

So I have those four things.

Now, are there others?
MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's a fair

17

summary, Justice Breyer.

18

complicated it gets to take something that was

19

designed for a judge and then send it before the

20

jury in jury instructions, I would ask the Court

21

to look at the Medas case, which we cite on page

22

15 of our reply brief.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think on sort of how

All right, if I

24

believe that that is just out of the question,

25

it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would

44

1

be a radical change, Congress could never have

2

intended that, what about a much simpler approach?

3

What you would do is take 3553(b), and you say,

4

"Read the word 'shall' -- i.e. 'shall apply the

5

guidelines' -- to 'may,'" so that the guidelines

6

become advisory, either because the "shall"

7

becomes a "may" or because you give each judge the

8

power to give any reasonable reason at all as to

9

why the Commission's guideline, they didn't

10

actively consider this factor.

11

read 3553(b) as permissive.

12

In other words,

And now, assuming I've expressed myself on

13

the underlying Apprendi questions, so I, but

14

suppose Blakely does apply, would you -- is -­

15

what would be wrong with taking that approach?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Assuming I understand the

17

approach you propose, there would be nothing wrong

18

with taking that approach.

19
20

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, I have thought
of one thing that might be wrong.

21

[Laughter.]

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

So I'll ask you about it,

if you want.

24

[Laughter.]

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could it be that "shall"

45

1

does not mean "may"?

Right?

2

[Laughter.]

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4
5

Oh, that's not it?

"Shall" -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, well, I -- you

6

see nothing wrong with that.

7

guidelines advisory, and there are a number of

8

objections -- maybe not, maybe big, maybe small.

9

One objection I was worried about is -- I'm giving

10

you my thought process, you know, and I -- because

11

I'm trying to get a -- your response -- is that if

12

we did take that approach, you'd leave the

13

appellate section in place.

14

the judge didn't use the guideline, the appeals

15

courts would have to review for reasonableness.

16

Now that would be in place.

17

judges all over the country having different views

18

on that.

19

views about was or what was not reasonable.

20

would be here to review those differences, and we

21

would become the sentencing commission.

22

I had escaped.

That means every time

We would discover

Courts of appeals would have different

23

[Laughter.]

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

That makes the

objection is that?

We

I thought

Now, how, how serious an

Or do you recommend that, if

46

1

you lose on this point, we take the approach of,

2

in that way, making the guidelines advisory?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

I would -- I would take the

4

approach that you should make the advisory -- the

5

advisory guidelines -- the guidelines as advisory.

6

Now, with respect to whether or not you've

7

escaped from the burden of serving on the

8

sentencing commission, I don't think that the

9

reading of 3742, the appeal provision, that you've

10

envisioned is necessarily foreordained.

11

-

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think ­

Well, have you escaped

13

Apprendi?

14

and appellate courts review, for the abuse of

15

discretion in applying those guidelines, why isn't

16

that the same kind of entitlement that the

17

Apprendi/Blakely opinion is predicated on to begin

18

with?

19

If discretion is cabined by guidelines

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Absolutely.

Vote me for

20

that.

I mean, after all, judges used to define

21

the elements of crimes, didn't they?

22

fact that the elements at common law were defined

23

by judges rather than by the legislature didn't

24

mean that you didn't have to have a jury find

25

them.

And the mere

So if courts are going to establish the

47

1

guidelines, so long as they are still binding, it

2

seems to me you still need a jury finding, or you

3

haven't escaped Apprendi.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

A couple of observations,

5

Justice Scalia.

First of all, you're exactly

6

right, since 1812 we've abandoned a system where

7

judges can define the elements of crimes.

8

that's why, if I leave you with one thought on the

9

remedy, I would think that it's inappropriate to

And

10

allow an entity within the judicial branch to have

11

that effect on a prospective basis.

12

would be a very serious separation of powers

13

problem.

14

powers problem that at least you found quite

15

significant in the Mistretta case.

16

I think that

I think it would dwarf the separation of

Now, if I can address Justice Kennedy's

17

question about the appeals system simply

18

replicating the Apprendi or the Blakely problem.

19

First of all, we would suggest that the appeal

20

process that you've envisioned would not violate

21

Apprendi and Blakely.

22

reasons that we think the Commission wouldn't

23

violate Blakely.

24

distinction in this court's cases.

25

this Court has said that judicial discretionary

And that's one of the

Because what we see is a

48

They have said

1

sentencing doesn't implicate the Sixth Amendment.

2

This Court has said that legislative-directed

3

sentencing does implicate the Sixth Amendment.

4

What the guidelines present is a situation of

5

judicial sentencing that's directive.

6

suggest -- we would suggest --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We would

Judicial discretionary

8

sentencing, as I understood it, never permitted an

9

appellate court to increase the sentence given by

10

the district judge.

11

where an appellate court said the district judge

12

did not give enough years, where there was

13

discretionary sentencing?

14

Do you have any cases,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I can

15

point you to the DiFrancesco case, where this

16

Court approved an earlier Federal statute that

17

allowed for appeals in sentencing.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be under

19

statute, but I do not know, at common law, that

20

when you talked about the discretion in the

21

courts, it meant that in a criminal case a court

22

of appeals could increase the sentence because of

23

a -- because of an abuse of discretion by the

24

sentencing judge.

25

case.

I'm unfamiliar with any such

49

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there are lots.

2

There are lots, actually.

3

"Is it right,

If you -- if -- I ask,

that?"

4

[Laughter.]

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, I mean, if you take

6

common law to mean England, as well as the United

7

States, there weren't here, because the sentences

8

weren't appealable,

9

appealable, and they had a common law work out of

but in England, they were

10

what they called the "tariff," which is what the

11

range of reasonableness was or wasn't.

12

prosecution, I believe, could appeal it of being

13

too low; and the defense, being too high.

14

question was, Was the sentence reasonable?

15

appellate court could set it.

16

And the

And the
The

Now, if we had a system like that -- and

17

this is my serious question -- is it

18

unconstitutional under Apprendi if appeals court

19

judges reviewing a sentence could say, "This is

20

the range of reason, this is arbitrary up here, or

21

this is arbitrary down there"?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think our position

23

would be that that kind of system would be

24

constitutional.

25

Kennedy, we think, because that system would be

As I was suggesting to Justice

50

1

constitutional, we think the guidelines are also

2

constitutional.

3

though, that somebody that says that that system

4

is unconstitutional and the guidelines is

5

unconstitutional is not going to be particularly

6

impressed by that reading of 3742 that gets you to

7

that result.

8
9

I think Justice Kennedy is right,

And that's why I want to leave you with an
important thought, which is, that reading of 3742

10

is not foreordained.

This court could say that

11

the guidelines should be applied in an advisory

12

fashion, and that all that would be left of the

13

Government -­

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That just seems so contrary

15

to what Congress intended.

16

that they intended this scheme to be advisory.

17

They told the Commission to set up a scheme that

18

would be applied, because they wanted to make

19

sentencing more uniformly applied in the Federal

20

scheme of things.

21

try to argue for the position taken by some

22

Federal judges in one of the amicus briefs that,

23

"It's just advisory, don't worry."

24

very difficult to understand how appellate review

25

could be applied to such a scheme.

There's no evidence

I think it's a real stretch to

51

And I find it

1

MR. CLEMENT:

But, Justice O'Connor,

2

that's why, to be clear, we've only argued in

3

favor of an advisory view of the guidelines if we

4

get to the remedial question, because I think

5

you're absolutely right, if you look at what

6

Congress actually intended, it's crystal clear

7

they did not intend the guidelines to be advisory.

8

But it's equally crystal clear they didn't intend

9

the guidelines to be the basis for jury fact-

10
11

finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, what if

12

this Court said the guidelines are

13

unconstitutional, period, and then judges simply

14

looked to the guidelines, figuring, well, this is

15

as good an idea as anybody else has about

16

sentencing?

17

[Laughter.]

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that actually would

19

be the proper remedy.

20

ask for, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

That's effectively what we

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­
And if it were done

22

that way, why would it be that you would try to

23

change the word "shall" to "may" in (b)?

24

just have Section 3553(a), which does list the

52

Why not

1

judges may take into account in sentencing, one of

2

-- among three or four others?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I think that's fair,

4

Justice Ginsburg.

I mean, in responding to

5

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, I didn't mean that

6

was the only way to get to the result we've

7

propose.

8

that we suggest that you would get to an advisory

9

use of the guidelines on a prospective basis is

And the particular way, in our briefs,

10

precisely as you suggest.

11

to change "may" to "shall"; instead, you read it,

12

unfortunately, I guess, if we've reached the

13

remedial question, to be unconstitutional.

14

then, at that point, you focus in on 3553(a) -­

15
16

You don't read 3553(b)

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21
22

Which has the

guidelines -­

17

19

And

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

-- as one of other

factors.
MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

And then if I

could just -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that that, as

23

Justice O'Connor suggests, deprives the statute of

24

its principal purpose, which was to constrain -­

25

to constrain judicial discretion.

53

If there's

1

anything clear about it, that was clear about, it

2

was that they did not want judges to have as much

3

discretion as they had.

4

things are just advisory.

5

easier to -- I wanted to ask you one very precise

6

question.

7

"jury" -- it doesn't have to mean "the judge" -­

8

where in, in the whole guideline system, how many

9

sections do not permit the use of "court" to mean

10

And now you say these
It seems to me much

Assuming I think "court" can mean

"jury"?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think there's only one

13

Well, I think -­

where, where it may not work.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't see how it

15

works in 3742(e), because if you read that section

16

in context it's talking about determinations made

17

by the court, it's talking about determinations

18

made by the court after the presentence report

19

comes in -­

20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:
one.

22
23

MR. CLEMENT:
3742(e) has to go.

24
25

That -- that may be the

-- and so I think that

I think the fairer -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:
has to go?

54

All right.

Anything else

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think the fairer

2

reading of 3553(b) is that it has to go, too.

3

know that you don't agree with -­

I

4

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know about fairer.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

I think you disagree with me

6

on that.

I think 994 -- 99 -- 994(a), in Title

7

28, which talks about the guidelines being for the

8

use of the sentencing court, I would suggest that

9

has to go, but I assume you would say sentencing

10

court can mean sentencing judge.

11

point, there's a provision of rule 32 of the

12

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that must go,

13

because it talks about the role of the district

14

court in a way that I don't think you can, sort

15

of, find to mean the jury.

16

obviously, the sentencing guidelines provision

17

that makes clear that it is the judge that's to

18

make the findings by a preponderance of the

19

evidence, has to go, as well.

20

-- that is -- that is the sum total of the carnage

21

of deciding -­

22

[Laughter.]

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24
25

Then at that

And then I think,

So I think that is

-- that the guidelines are

fully applicable with Blakely.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

55

If you -- if you

1

interpret "court" to mean "jury," how many of the

2

sentencing factors which will be submitted to the

3

jury are -- would be a radical departure from the

4

tradition, the role of the jury in the criminal

5

system in the Anglo-American tradition?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I think very, very many of

7

them.

I mean, I can't give you a better answer

8

than that, in terms of the number.

9

case, on page 15 of a reply brief that I suggested

But the Medas

10

the Court look at, provides one example.

There,

11

you had a case where it had already gone to the,

12

to the jury on a general verdict, and it had the

13

typical kind of general verdict form you see.

14

It's had a six-count indictment.

15

guilty/non-guilty for each of the six crimes in

16

the indictment.

17

that Blakely might require jury findings on all

18

the various enhancements, the Government tried to

19

put in a 20-page supplemental special verdict that

20

tried to walk through the various factors that the

21

jury would try to find.

22

miniature, shows you the kind of transformation

23

you're talking about.

24

general verdict form, which is the classic kind of

25

verdict form used in the criminal system, to 20

There were 12 boxes,

Then when there was a concern

I think that just, in

You go from a 12-line

56

1

pages of a supplemental special verdict form.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

rid of that prosecutor.

4

very sensible at all.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, you ought to get

That didn't seem to me

With respect, Justice

6

Scalia, I think if you look at that supplemental

7

verdict form, and you look at the guidelines,

8

there's no other way to do it.

9

the judge in that case said, one of the things

And I think, as

10

that comes up in virtually every guidelines case

11

is the issue of relevant conduct.

12

very, very difficult thing to try to

13

jury on.

14

Commission itself have come up in span eight and a

15

half pages of very small, single spaced text.

16

try to give that as jury instructions, I think,

17

would leave the jury completely bewildered.

18

Now, that is a
instruct the

The application notes that the

To

Then, you'd also, though, even if you

19

could get past the instruction problems, the

20

effect of considering relevant conduct is going to

21

have a transformative effect on what goes before

22

the jury, because relevant conduct asks the jury

23

not to focus on the elements of the specific

24

crime; the relevant conduct focuses on the other

25

acts of that individual defendant and, if there's

57

1

joint criminal, if there's a joint criminal

2

undertaking, the reasonably foreseeable events of

3

acts of others taken in furtherance of the joint

4

undertaking.

5

guideline, designed for judges, and sending it to

6

the jury, is effectively to transform many, many

7

cases from individual defendant cases to scheme

8

cases or conspiracy cases.

9

Now, the effect of using that

So in tallying up the carnage and the

10

wreckage of applying these guidelines designed

11

clearly for judge fact-finding and willy - nilly

12

sending them to the jury, I think you have to

13

include the confusion and the difficulty of that.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Clement can I -- you

15

don't have an awful lot

16

to ask you one rather important question, to me.

17

There's been a lot of talk about severability of

18

the statute, and I can understand the concept that

19

we'll only apply it in certain categories of

20

cases.

21

I'm thinking of the text of a written statute.

22

there a particular provision of the sentencing

23

guidelines that you think can be severed from the

24

rest of the statute?

25

of time left, and I want

But normally when I consider severability,

MR. CLEMENT:

Is

Well, Justice Stevens, I

58

1

think with respect to the Sentencing Reform Act

2

itself, the statute, the provision that we think

3

needs to be severed is 3553(b).

4

respect to the Guidelines, I think our view on the

5

guidelines -­

6

Then, with

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just sticking to the

7

statute, take out 3553(b) in its entirety, you

8

just -­

9

MR. CLEMENT: Well, the specific reference

10

to "shall" -- this is basically the "shall/may"

11

issue -- I think that needs to be severed.

12

not quite sure what of 3553(b) is left after you

13

do that, but that's -- that's the important thing.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm

I'm just not sure what's

15

left of the whole statute if you take that

16

provision out entirely.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think, as Justice

18

Ginsburg suggests, 3553(a) still stands alone as

19

telling the court that it should consider that.

20

And I think, in fact, if you look at the

21

legislative history, I actually think the language

22

in 3553(b) was, was a floor amendment that was

23

added later.

24

whole statute down to take that one provision out

25

of the statute.

So it certainly doesn't pull the

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF T. CHRISTOPHER KELLY

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BOOKER

8
9

MR. KELLY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The first 22 years of Freddie Booker's

11

sentence punished him for crimes that were proved

12

to a jury.

13

years to his sentence, years that were only

14

authorized by the judge's finding that Booker

15

probably committed other crimes.

16

of other Federal defendants, Booker's sentence was

17

increased based on crimes that were never proved

18

to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

19

years of a Federal sentence are as worthy of

20

constitutional protections against undeserved

21

punishment as are the first years.

22

But the judge added another eight

JUSTICE BREYER:

Like thousands

The final

Suppose that the judge

23

had simply sentenced the defendant, let's say, to

24

ten years, but looked at these other crimes and

25

said, "In my practice, I go to 15."

60

All right?

1

That's the basic situation.

unconstitutional?

MR. KELLY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, there are no

Under the guidelines or under

Is that

MR. KELLY:

No, that is not

unconstitutional.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now suppose

10

the people who do exactly the same thing is the

11

Court of Appeals applying the word "reasonable,"

12

these officials of the judicial branch.

13

they're reviewing the sentence for reasonableness.

14

They say, "In our practice when a person commits

15

bank robbery, if it's just an ordinary case, we think

16

it's reasonable five years; but if he has a gun,

17

seven years."

18

the most that isn't arbitrary.

But if there's a

19

gun, you can go to seven years.

In other words,

20

an English-type tariff system.

21

unconstitutional?

22
23

So if there's no gun, five years is

MR. KELLY:

Is that

I believe it would be, Justice

Breyer.

24
25

See,

JUSTICE BREYER:
So -­

61

You would think it would be.

1

MR. KELLY: Right.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- now suppose the people

3

who do it are the parole commission -- as happen

4

to be in the United States, executive branch

5

officials.

6

sentences, for example, that were indeterminate,

7

or might have been for 30 years.

say, "It is our practice, assuming good behavior,

9

that if it was just an ordinary bank robbery we'll

For the last hundred years, they get

10

keep him in for five years, but if he had a gun,

11

he's going to stay in for seven."

unconstitutional?

13

MR. KELLY:

14

increase sentences.

15

sentences.

16
17

Is that

Parole commissions don't
Parole commissions decrease

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, what they have is an

indeterminate sentence.

18

MR. KELLY:

Right.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. KELLY:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

California.

Yes.
And what they say is, "In

22

our practice, what we do is, we think it's

23

reasonable, and we will keep a person in prison

24

for five years in an ordinary bank robbery, but

25

for seven years if he has a gun."

62

I'm asking if

1

that's constitutional.

2

practice that they follow under parole commission

3

guidelines, and they've done it now for a decade,

4

I make up.

5
6

MR. KELLY:
Honor.

Because that's the

That is constitutional, Your

And the reason is -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's constitutional.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does he have an

9
10

entitlement to a certain number of years under any
of these questions?

11

MR. KELLY:

As I -­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you're sentenced to

13

an indeterminate sentence, he's not entitled to

14

parole at any time -­

15

MR. KELLY:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. KELLY:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Other than venues --- is he?

No, not at all.

And as I -­

What I'm trying to drive

19

at -- and I'll be -- is that I can't imagine a

20

court holding that a parole commission in the

21

executive branch that has exactly this same system

22

would be behaving unconstitutionally.

23

difficult for me to imagine -- though you say I'm

24

wrong on that -- a court holding it's

25

unconstitutional when a court of appeals does the

63

It's

1

same thing reviewing for arbitrariness.

2

MR. KELLY:

Well, perhaps I misunderstood

3

your second hypothetical, Your Honor.

But my

4

understanding of the hypothetical was that if the

5

judge gave five years and the appellate court

6

said, "No, you should have given seven years

7

because of the existence of a certain fact" -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KELLY: "you must -- you must increase

10

You know, I -­

the sentence --"

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not phrasing the

12

question well.

13

guidelines run by a parole commission, executive

14

branch officials.

15

sentencing guidelines run under the word arbitrary

16

by ordinary courts of appeals panels reviewing the

17

sentences.

18

then, I would ask, why is it unconstitutional to

19

put the executive branch and judicial branch

20

officials together in one group called the

21

sentencing commission?

22

I'm trying to imagine sentencing

I'm trying to imagine

And if those are both constitutional,

MR. KELLY:

The relevant constitutional

23

principle doesn't have to do with whether it's the

24

executive branch of Government or the judicial

25

branch of Government; it has to do whether a fact

64

1

is necessary in order to increase a sentence.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand that.

And ­

3

- well, maybe I'm just not going to get my

4

question across.

5

Would Apprendi apply to parole commission

6

guidelines?

7

we're going to reverse a hundred years of history,

8

is no.

9

panel with the power to review sentences for

10

I am trying to imagine Apprendi.

I should think the answer, unless

Would Apprendi apply to a court of appeals

arbitrariness?

11

MR. KELLY:

No.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would think the answer

13

is no.

14

we take judicial officials and executive branch

15

officials, and they do exactly the same thing

16

under the heading Sentencing Commission.

17

And, therefore, I wonder why it applies if

MR. KELLY:

In your hypotheticals, Justice

18

Breyer, as I understand them, each of those

19

entities is decreasing a sentence.

20

about a sentencing commission that authorizes a

21

court and, in fact -- well, authorizes a court to

22

increase a sentence after finding a particular

23

fact, and that is what triggers the Sixth

24

Amendment protection.

25

is authorized to give a longer sentence because of

We're talking

It's the fact that a judge

65

1

the existence of a fact than he would otherwise be

2

authorized to impose.

3

protection against which the Sixth Amendment jury

4

trial right protects.

5

be found by a jury, not by a judge.

6

And that is the essential

That is a fact that has to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what is your

7

position if judges simply have complete discretion

8

to sentence within a maximum range, and Judge A

9

gives a lot of maximum sentences, and Judge B

10

doesn't?

11

Is that system constitutional?
MR. KELLY:

There is no Sixth Amendment

12

problem with that system, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What is it in our legal

14

tradition -- what policies are served by

15

preferring unexplained, unarticulated,

16

standardless discretion to a system in which the

17

judge gives reasons and follows careful standards

18

and follows -- and follows standards that give

19

consistency from one sentence to the other?

20

should the former be preferred?

21

here?

22

MR. KELLY:

Why

What are we doing

I think, Justice Kennedy, that

23

Blakely answers that question.

24

distinguishes between a discretionary system in

25

which the judge has the authority to consider a

66

Blakely

1

number of different factors in order to do what

2

the judge thinks is fair, but is not required to ­

3

-

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. KELLY:

6

What policies -­

-- give any particular weight

--

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- are being furthered

8

by that, other than wooden adherence to Apprendi

9

and Blakely?

10

MR. KELLY:

The policy is that if a

11

judge's sentencing authority increases by finding

12

of fact, which is not the case in a discretionary

13

system.

14

leave to a jury, because juries -­

15

That fact is the kind of finding that we

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't that, isn't

16

that ultimately formalistic and contrary to our

17

whole design of our system, which is to learn over

18

experience and to codify and to explain what

19

considerations we take into account in applying

20

the law?

21

MR. KELLY:

I don't think it's contrary to

22

our system, Your Honor, to say that if a more

23

serious sentence attaches to a more serious crime,

24

or to a more serious version of a crime, that it's

25

up to the jury to decide whether the more serious

67

1

crime or more serious version was committed.

2

fact, that is essential to our system.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In

So suppose, in Justice

4

Breyer's hypothetical -- like the California

5

indeterminate sentencing regime which applied

6

until about 20 years ago,

7

sentence, the parole board interviews two people

8

convicted for the same crime; one was the

9

ringleader, street-hardened offender, and the

after an indeterminate

10

other was just a novice, a guy that went along,

11

although he -- they both committed the same crime.

12

Under the California system, the former would be

13

given a projected release date of ten years; and

14

the other, a projected release date of about two

15

years.

Would that be constitutional?

16

MR. KELLY:

Yes, it would, because, again,

17

under a discretionary system, the judge's

18

sentencing authority is unaffected by the finding

19

of a fact.

20

that one offender's sentence should be decreased

21

and the other offender's should not be decreased,

22

that has no Sixth Amendment application or Sixth

23

Amendment -­

24
25

If the parole commission determines

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, we're trying to go

to the same point, and I think you're actually

68

1

given me a pretty good answer.

2

MR. KELLY:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The --

Thank you.
I'm imagining my system

4

being the system that Apprendi forbids.

So I'm

5

not doing increase/decreases.

6

very kind of system.

7

this -- and remember, I dissented in Apprendi.

I'll think of the

And I take it your answer is

8

MR. KELLY:

I remember.

9

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't agree with it.

10

Right.

But there we are.

And so I'm trying to

11

see how far it goes.

12

Apprendi system and now it's being administered by

13

a parole commission.

14

and now it's being administered by a court of

15

appeals using the legal standard arbitrariness.

16

And I take it your answer is those are just as

17

unconstitutional.

So I wonder, we take our

We take our Apprendi system,

18

MR. KELLY:

No, no, again, I'm not -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now you understand what

20

I'm doing, because I'm saying you either have to

21

follow the force of your logic and make those

22

unconstitutional, too, or you have to say there's

23

a difference.

24

difference is who promulgated it.

25

course, I'm going to ask you, if there's a

And, by definition, the only

69

And then, of

1

difference right there, why doesn't this one,

2

which is executive plus judicial, fall on my side

3

of the difference?

4

MR. KELLY:

Well, maybe I -- maybe I don't

5

understand your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,

6

because parole commissions do not increase

7

sentences; parole commissions decrease sentences.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
parole commission --

10

MR. KELLY:

11

[Laughter.]

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

No, I -- in my imaginary

Okay.

-- I will argue a

different point.

14

MR. KELLY:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I will argue it

16

another time.

17

commission guidelines, and I would say they, a lot

18

of them did fall within the Apprendi boundaries.

19

But if we did take it and have the parole

20

commission do it -- "it," being the Apprendi

21

forbidden system, in your view, is it

22

unconstitutional?

23

I've seen a lot of parole

MR. KELLY:

It would certainly be

24

unconstitutional for a parole commission to find a

25

fact that increased a sentence.

70

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. KELLY:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

All right.

Okay.

Yes.
And then the same thing

is true of a -- of a court of appeals panel.

5

MR. KELLY:

If it could find a fact that

6

increased a sentence, yes, because those facts

7

must be found by a jury.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kelly, I would be

interested in hearing you address some of the

10

severability problems that the Government has been

11

raising.

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If I could just ask one

more question, because this is important to me.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about the previous

16

California system in which it was an indeterminate

17

sentence and the correctional authority made

18

findings which set the sentence?

19

they were committed to the California -­

20

MR. KELLY:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY :

They were -­

Sure.
-- correctional authority

22

for the term prescribed by law, and that was set

23

after the fact, post hoc, by the California Adult

24

Authority.

25

MR. KELLY:

If the agency were increasing

71

1

an authorized sentence -­

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
it.

4
5

MR. KELLY:

-- on the basis of a finding ­

-

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's an indeterminate

sentence.

8

MR. KELLY:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

They're not increasing

MR. KELLY:

Right.
They set the sentence.

After the -- instead of the

judge or after the judge?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

It was just

13

sentenced, the judge, for the term prescribed by

14

law.

15

defendant, after looking at the probation report,

16

set the sentence.

17

could be for life.

And an agency, after interviewing the

18
19

The term prescribed by law

MR. KELLY:

If there were facts which were

necessary to authorize -­

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He sets the sentence

21

within the range authorized by the jury's verdict.

22

That's the question.

23

MR. KELLY:

Right, that's fine.

If it's

24

within the range authorized by the jury's verdict,

25

it's fine.

72

1

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well.

2

What if, what if the statute says "every felony in

3

this state shall be punished by a term of not less

4

than one year, or, on the other side, life," and

5

you're committed to the parole authority, and the

6

parole authority will decide between those

7

boundaries?

8
9

MR. KELLY:

Assuming that authority is

given to the parole commission to select a

10

sentence, and no further findings need to be made

11

beyond those made by the jury, there's no Sixth

12

Amendment problem with that.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There might be a due

process problem.
MR. KELLY: In fact, there might be a lot

16

of other constitutional problems, but not a Sixth

17

Amendment problem.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I hope you will go over

19

to the -- to the severability problem, because, as

20

I understood it, you and the Government were very

21

much at odds about what should be severed and what

22

shouldn't, and we didn't get to ask Mr. Clement

23

about his severance, which was going to be that to

24

the extent no plus factors are involved, no

25

sentence-enhancing factors are involved, the

73

1

guidelines remain binding.

2

to say that in his argument, and I hope he'll

3

address it.

4
5

He didn't get a chance

And you say, "Whatever you do, don't make
it half binding and half advisory."

6

MR. KELLY:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why would it be so

8

terrible to say, "Well, to the extent that there

9

are no

sentencing enhancing factors, let's

10

preserve what Congress did, let's make them

11

binding when the jury doesn't have to find

12

anything"?

13

MR. KELLY:

For a couple of reasons,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

certainly didn't intend to have dual systems.

16

That destroys the congressional purpose of

17

uniformity because you would have sentences, I

18

suppose, being uniform under systems -- the system

19

where guidelines applied, but certainly not under

20

the system where the guidelines don't apply,

21

because there are guideline facts that need to be

22

found.

23

advanced.

24
25

The first is that Congress

So that congressional purpose is not

The second problem is that it's such an
easily manipulable system, particularly by the

74

1

Government.

2

guidelines, it doesn't allege a sentence-enhancing

3

fact, or a guideline fact.

4

doesn't want to be bound by the guidelines, it

5

alleges a guideline fact, and that takes

6

sentencing out of the guidelines.

7

be what Congress intended.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

If the Government wants to be in the

If the Government

And that cannot

Is it any less uniform,

any more manipulable, than on your proposal?

10

MR. KELLY:

Our -­

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, uniformity is

12

gone.

13

faced as a fact, and I'm not sure that you're

14

proposing a better solution, I gather.

15

A certain manipulability has got to be

MR. KELLY:

Well, I think our proposal

16

doesn't really allow for any manipulation at all,

17

Justice Souter.

18

finder must be a jury instead of a judge.

19

We're simply saying that the fact

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, except that the

20

manipulation, at that point, is the manipulation,

21

in a way, in the present system, and that is it's

22

the manipulability of charge bargaining.

23

MR. KELLY:

Well, that's certainly true,

24

and that exists under the guidelines.

25

without the guidelines.

It exists in

75

It exists

1

discretionary systems.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does exist under the

4

guidelines?

How does it?

5

MR. KELLY:

I think it does, because -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. KELLY:

How?

Well, certainly, to the extent

8

that prosecutors make decisions about what charges

9

they're going to bring -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, only, only, only if

11

you have statutes that have mandatory minimums or

12

that have lesser sentences.

13

MR. KELLY:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true.

Right.
But compared to the

15

status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one

16

of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind

17

of manipulation.

18

they had succeeded on that point.

19

And, by and large, I thought

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, hasn't charge

20

bargaining simply been replaced with fact

21

bargaining?

22

MR. KELLY:

It has, to a large extent.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that lawful under the

24

guideline?

Is the judge required to accept the

25

facts as the -- as the prosecution and defense

76

1

agree to present them?

2
3

MR. KELLY:

The judge is not required to ­

-

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. KELLY:

6

judge typically does.

7

No.

-- accept the facts.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The

I'm not sure that I

8

understand why you wouldn't have the same

9

alternatives under your view.

Because is it not

10

correct that if the, if the sentence -- the change

11

under consideration is a decrease, those findings

12

could be made by a judge.

13

increase, you'd say they have to be found by a

14

jury.

15

of a two-track system under your view?

16

Whereas, if it's an

So why don't you have the same possibility

MR. KELLY:

I guess -- I wouldn't view

17

that as a two-track system, because the guidelines

18

would continue to apply in either case.

19

not be a situation in which the guidelines apply

20

to some criminal sentencings, but don't apply to

21

other criminal sentencings.

22

apply in every criminal sentencing.

23

fact finder needs to be a judge or a jury depends

24

upon whether the fact to be found increases the

25

judge's sentencing authority.

77

It would

The guidelines will
Whether a

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you would say -- you

2

would say your proposal is closer to what Congress

3

really wanted, because it would leave in place all

4

of the sentences that would be commanded by the

5

guidelines, but just require a different fact

6

finder in some of the cases.

7
8

MR. KELLY:
Stevens.

9

That's exactly right, Justice

You -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then what about all

10

the factors -- Justice Breyer outlined four

11

categories of, of guideline factors that are not

12

easily, if at all, presented to the jury.

13

Chief Justice mentioned the one of perjury at the

14

trial itself.

15

because it hasn't happened until the trial.

16

some of the others that become very complicated,

17

like he mentioned, other -- other relevant

18

conduct, relevant conduct, yeah.

19

MR. KELLY:

The

Could never give that to a jury
And

I agree that perjury is not

20

something that could be submitted to a jury -­

21

perjury during trial is not something that could

22

be submitted to a jury.

23
24
25

That's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that would just be

out.
MR. KELLY:

That would be out.

78

That's one

1

of the very few.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KELLY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well couldn't he have a

sentencing phase afterwards?

8
9

It would have to be prosecuted

as a separate crime.

It would have to be

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't know.
Could I interrupt for

that?

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's one thing that's

12

running through my mind.

13

gets on the stand and testifies to a version of

14

the events that the jury must have disbelieved in

15

order to convict?

16

effect, he would be making the finding -- he would

17

say, "The jury has really found this fact, and,

18

therefore, I can rely on it."

19

What if the defendant

Could not the judge -- in

MR. KELLY:

I don't think so, Justice

20

Stevens, because the judge is still making the

21

finding that the witness deliberately lied, as

22

opposed to being mistaken in his testimony.

23

that is a finding of fact that increases

24

sentencing authority.

25

jury returning a guilty verdict in every case

And

So I don't think that a

79

1

means that the jury disbelieved, or thought at

2

least, that the defendant was lying.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is your answer to

4

Justice Ginsburg's question?

And I'd appreciate

5

your focusing on what I thought were the two most

6

important ones, which is, first, the -- I thought

7

that sentencing for a hundred years had gone on

8

primarily on the basis of the presentence report.

9

And the idea was, the person is convicted and now

10

we're going to decide what to do with this

11

individual who's convicted, and we're going to

12

read what the probation officer writes about it,

13

and he'll go interview people after, as he does.

14

And many, many, many, if not most, of the facts in

15

that presentence report were not available at the

16

time of trial.

17

individual, and they're more about the manner in

18

which the crime was carried out.

19

They're about the history of the

And the other main thing is the -- is the

20

vast number of really complex operations,

21

multiple-count rules, relevant conduct, all kinds

22

of things that -- try even "brandishing."

23

that's the second thing, the complexity.

24

So the presentence report -­

25

MR. KELLY:

Sure.

80

I mean,

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- and the complexity.
In other words, the

3

tradition was that we asked the jury to determine

4

what crime was committed, and the sentencing judge

5

to determine the context in which it was

6

committed.

7

MR. KELLY:

And that still happens, even

8

under our proposal, to a large extent, Your Honor,

9

because the presentence report has historically

10

guided a judge in exercising his discretion at

11

sentencing.

12

exercises discretion in selecting a sentence

13

within a guideline range, the judge will still

14

rely upon the presentence report.

15

most of what's in a presentence report doesn't

16

have to do with finding extra facts; it has to do

17

with guiding discretion in selecting a sentence.

18

So I don't think that that really changes under

19

our system.

20

To the extent that the judge

And, frankly,

With regard to the complexity, it's been

21

my experience in defending Federal criminal cases

22

that although the guidelines are lengthy, there

23

are only two or three that are likely to apply in

24

any particular case, and it's not particularly

25

complex to figure out what those are, and it

81

1

wouldn't be all that complex to charge a jury with

2

regard to how to determine facts that are required

3

by the guidelines.

4

instructions that are complicated all the time.

5

We do it in RICO -­

6

We give juries jury

JUSTICE BREYER:

Congress's basic --

7

that's a good answer.

Congress's basic objective

8

here is -- was uniformity.

9

objective, whether or not it's been achieved or,

I think it was a noble

10

but are you saying to Congress, Sorry, the

11

Constitution prohibits you, in Congress, from

12

trying to create uniformity, or greater

13

uniformity, of sentencing among district judges?

14

There's just no way you can do it, because if you

15

throw everything to a jury, you know, you throw it

16

right into the hands of the prosecutor to

17

determine what to charge, what not to charge, what

18

facts to agree upon, et cetera, no way to do it?

19

We're back to our two cellmates -- one day served,

20

50 years served -- though the real conduct was the

21

same.

22

MR. KELLY:

The real conduct can still be

23

proved to a jury, as long as it's charged and

24

proved to a jury.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

82

How about the

1

form of verdict under your system?

2

line for the basic offense, and then other lines

3

for each additional factor that's alleged in the

4

indictment?

5

MR. KELLY:

Is there one

There may be, depending on

6

the case.

7

verdict is adequate because there are no guideline

8

facts to find that would increase sentencing -­

9

There may be cases in which a general

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But you're

10

suggesting, then, a special -- a special verdict

11

in every case where there are guideline facts to

12

be found.

13

MR. KELLY:

Just as special verdicts have

14

been used since Apprendi to find drug quantities

15

and other facts that increase maximum sentences.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But a special verdict

17

wouldn't do from the point of view of the

18

defendant, I think would resist it very heavily,

19

if what the findings have to be are, say, a much

20

larger drug quantity, the relevant conduct.

21

are things that could be damning for a defendant.

22

So a defendant surely would not want that, all of

23

this to be tried to the jury that's going to try

24

the basic case.

25

to have the jury not know about that it wasn't

These

The defendant would much prefer

83

1

five ounces, that it was 500 grams, or that, at

2

the same time, the defendant did a lot of other

3

bad things.

4

MR. KELLY:

Your Honor, I think we can

5

trust district judges to fashion procedural

6

protections that assure that trials are fair.

7

That might, in some cases, mean bifurcating the

8

underlying elements of the offense and the

9

determination of those elements from the finding

10
11
12

of guideline facts -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you would have to

have, then, essentially two trials.

13

MR. KELLY:

In some cases, yes.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't it -- isn't

15

it -- isn't that going to be so in every relevant

16

conduct case in which the Government thinks the

17

relevant conduct is a serious factor?

18

either going to have to be a separate jury verdict

19

on sentencing, or the district judge is going to

20

be limited simply to whatever range the jury fact

21

finding provides as the maximum range.

22

no other possibilities, are there?

23

MR. KELLY:

There's

There are

Well, in some of those cases,

24

Your Honor, the additional facts would come in on

25

the main trial anyway, as 404(b) kind of evidence

84

1

that is relevant to proving the underlying

2

charges.

3

then there probably wouldn't be a second part of

4

the trial.

5

And if it's going to come in anyway,

So I think -­
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the defendant

6

in that case going to say look, I, I'm claiming a

7

serious problem, if you're asking the jury to make

8

a specific finding that I committed relevant facts

9

A, B, C, D, and E, even though I don't happen to

10

have been subjected to a criminal guilty verdict

11

with respect to each one.

12

findings, you're going to skew the jury's mind to

13

the point where I'm not going to get a fair shake

14

on the guilty/not guilty finding or special fact

15

finding most immediately relevant to this case.

16

Every defendant is going to demand a separate jury

17

proceeding for that, isn't he?

18
19
20

By, by requiring those

MR. KELLY: It's certainly possible that
they'll demand separate, or bifurcation -­
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you wouldn't sit

21

back and allow that focus, if you're the defense

22

lawyer you're not going to allow that focus to be

23

made at the time of the basic guilty/non guilty

24

finding, are you?

25

MR. KELLY:

Well, I've had experience with

85

1

that.

And my experience has been, as I've said

2

before, I might ask for a bifurcated trial, but if

3

the judge thinks that that evidence is going to

4

come in against my client anyway, the judge is

5

going to deny bifurcation.

6

you're right, this would be prejudicial to

7

introduce this evidence in the main case, then

8

we'll bifurcate the trial, and we'll let the jury

9

find guilty not guilty and then find

If the judge says

10

sentencing facts if a guilty verdict is

11

returned.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know what the

12
13

Kansas system is?

I mean, right after Apprendi,

14

they transformed their guideline system into one

15

where the jury makes the findings, but are all of

16

their trials bifurcated?
MR. KELLY:

17

I don't know if they bifurcate

18

all their trials.

My understanding is that it

19

works in a way that's similar to what I'm

20

suggesting could happen in Federal court.
JUSTICE BREYER: As long as you're on the

21
22

subject, I'm quite --- you're going to --- what is

23

your reaction to what I've written, which you've,

24

you're just going to say wrong, wrong, wrong, but I want to

25

know why.

And what I know why in particular is I

86

1

speculated somewhat, that the reason that this

2

might work, your side of it, if it works despite

3

the, the complication, the bifurcated trials,

4

etc., is that 97 percent of the cases are handled

5

through plea bargaining, and this will give you a

6

little bit of a leg up, which I speculated the

7

defense bar likes.

8

I thought with in the long run, you just can't

9

have a system of justice that depends for its

I'm not surprised.

But then,

10

workable nature upon plea bargaining, which in

11

fact depends on the weapons you give to

12

prosecutors.

13

up thinking, I just can't

14

underwrite such a thing.

15

your, your, your reaction to that.

And so I ended

And I'd like to get

16

MR. KELLY:

Your Honor, here's how plea

17

bargaining works now.

18

easiest crime to prove that he can prove.

19

is no effective plea bargaining in most of those

20

cases because the prosecutor knows he's going to

21

win that trial.

22

because he doesn't want to lose his, his reduction

23

for acceptance of responsibility.

24

changes is probably if our proposal is accepted,

25

that there is more meaningful negotiation and that

The prosecutor charges the
There

So the defendant pleads guilty

87

I think what

1

prosecutors and defense attorney's will come to an

2

understanding in most cases of what sentencing facts

3

are provable, and what are not, and cases will

4

continue to plead out much the same as they do

5

right now, except more effectively because we

6

eliminate the problem of the prosecutor being able

7

to prove the easiest charge and save the heart of

8

the case for sentencing.

9

I think with that, Your Honor, I will,

10

unless there are other questions, defer to my

11

colleague.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
Kelly.

Thank you, Mr.

Ms. Scapicchio.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSEMARY SCAPICCHIO

15

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FANFAN

16

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

As to question one,

17

there's no meaningful difference between the

18

Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington

19

State Guidelines.

20

in their brief to this Court in Blakely.

21

they filed an amicus brief in Blakely they told

22

this Court, or they urged this Court not to

23

invalidate the Washington State Guidelines

24

because, they told this Court, if you do, they are

25

so similar to the Federal Guidelines that the

The Government conceded as much

88

When

1

Federal Guidelines will fall as well.

2

they are, less than five months later, standing

3

before the same Court, saying something completely

4

different.

5

to the Washington State Guidelines, but that

6

they're completely different, and that they don't

7

operate in the same manner at all.

8
9

And here

Now, it's not that they're so similar

And what it comes down to is that for
Sixth Amendment purposes, the source of the law

10

doesn't matter.

11

they filed their amicus brief in Blakely.

12

doesn't matter to a defendant whether or not the

13

source of the law is legislative, or the source of

14

the law is by commission or regulatory body.

15

the sentence is going to increase, based on a fact

16

that, that the law makes essential to punishment,

17

that fact must be pled and proved to a jury beyond a

18

reasonable doubt.

19

The Government got it right when

JUSTICE BREYER:

It

If

So can I ask you the same

20

question?

Imagine that the statute says bank

21

robbery is zero to twenty years.

22

separate statute says a guideline commission will

23

make distinctions, and the guideline commission

24

says, "five years in the ordinary case, seven

25

years with a gun."

Case one, a

Case two, the same thing but a

89

1

parole commission does it.

Case three, the same

2

thing, but a court of appeals panel does it, under

3

the guise of what's arbitrary, what isn't.

4

They're all, in your opinion, to be treated alike.

5

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

6

necessary to increase the sentence --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

If there's a fact

Well, there is just what

I said, just what I said.

9

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Then yes.

10

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

11

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

With respect to Mr.

12

Fanfan in this case,

13

promulgated based on the jury verdict alone.

14

Fanfan, the Government chose to indict Mr. Fanfan

15

on a single count of conspiracy.

16

on a single count of conspiracy.

17
18

Mr. Fanfan's sentence was
Mr.

He went to trial

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Conspiracy to
what?

19

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Conspiracy to distribute

20

500 grams of cocaine.

The Government knew at the

21

time of trial that Mr. Fanfan was arrested with

22

281 grams of crack cocaine at the time of his

23

arrest.

24

for that 281 grams of crack cocaine, and instead,

25

they chose to prove the easiest possible

The Government chose not to indict him

90

1

indictment before the jury.

2

dismissed in this case, the Government then sought

3

to increase Mr. Fanfan's sentence by 157 months,

4

based on the possession of the crack cocaine that

5

they knew about at the very beginning, and we're

6

suggesting that Judge Hornby did the right thing

7

in limiting Mr. Fanfan's sentence to that which

8

was supported by the jury verdict alone and

9

nothing else.

10

Once the jury was

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Hornby had some

11

distress in doing that, didn't he, because the

12

difference was quite large?

13

judge found, it would have been fifteen or sixteen

14

years as opposed to five or six years?

15

Based on what the

MS. SCAPICCHIO: What Judge Hornby did for

16

Mr. Fanfan was, he conducted what he called a

17

presentence, a pre-Blakely hearing, and at the

18

pre-Blakely hearing he allowed the prosecutor to

19

present evidence relative to relevant conduct

20

involved in the offense.

21

presented evidence that the relevant conduct

22

included this possession of 281 grams of crack

23

cocaine, as well as a case agent who claimed that

24

Mr. Fanfan was the leader of this entire

25

conspiracy.

And the prosecutor

And then Judge Hornby went on to say,

91

1

based on everything that he heard in the pre-

2

Blakely hearing, if given the opportunity, he

3

would sentence my client to between 188 to 235

4

months.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He didn't say it, that

6

that was his discretionary choice. He said that -­

7

-

8

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

He was required.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He made, he made those

10

findings of fact, that -- leadership role and the

11

quantity of drugs.

12

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

He did.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on the basis of

14

those two he said the guidelines would require me

15

to come up with this higher sentence, not that

16

using the guidelines as advisory he would have

17

gotten -­

18

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Absolutely.

It was the

19

guidelines required him to impose sentence between

20

188 to 235 months.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then the other,

22

that's the high range, and the low range is, I'll

23

just stick with the crime that he was indicted

24

for, and that's five or six years.

25

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

92

He, what Judge Hornby did

1

is, is he sentenced Mr. Fanfan based solely on the

2

jury's verdict.

3

the conspiracy to distribute 500 grams of crack

4

cocaine.

5

and thus returned a verdict based solely on the

6

500 grams of crack cocaine, then Mr. Fanfan's

7

sentence, according to Judge Hornby after this

8

Court decided Blakely, was limited to the jury

9

verdict alone.

10
11

The jury only heard evidence of

Because the jury only heard evidence,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's quite a windfall

for Mr. Fanfan, isn't it?

12

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Well, in this particular

13

case I would say no, because the Government

14

knew when this Court decided Apprendi,

15

and certainly knew by the time this

16

Court decided Ring, that if they wanted

17

to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the

18

statutory max, that they should plead it and prove

19

it in the indictment.

20

chose not to.

21

may -- get

22

Court's decision in Blakely, certainly he does.

23

I'm not denying that he doesn't.

24

the Government didn't do what this Court told them

25

they should do in both Apprendi and Ring.

And in this case, they

And so, whether or not Mr. Fanfan

some benefit because of this

93

But only because

1

CHIEF JUSTICE STEVENS:

Did the trial

2

judge give any indication of what sentence he

3

would have imposed if he were not constrained by

4

the guidelines?

5

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

He did not.

He indicated

6

that, if the guidelines applied, that he believed

7

Mr. Fanfan fell between 188 and 235 months.

8

was no discussion at all as to whether or not he

9

had discretion to sentence anywhere outside the

10
11

There

guidelines during this proceeding.
And, with respect to question two in this

12

case, whether or not the guidelines are severable,

13

which of course is the more difficult question

14

before the Court, our proposal to sever out those

15

portions of the guidelines that require judicial

16

fact finding by a preponderance of the evidence

17

will accomplish the sentencing reform goals.

18

goals of the sentencing reform were uniformity,

19

proportionality, and certainty.

20

The

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You wouldn't

21

sever out the ones that would permit a downward

22

departure, would you?

23
24
25

MS. SCAPICCHIO: Would we sever the
portions of the statute that require --­
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You would leave

94

1

in place the provisions for downward departures?

2
3

MS. SCAPICCHIO: We would leave in place
the majority of the sentencing guidelines.

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, and -- but
could you answer my question?

6
7

MS. SCAPICCHIO:
I sever out --

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, would

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Would you leave
in place the provisions for downward departure?

10

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
How can you do that?

12

The statute that makes the guidelines mandatory

13

applies to both upwards and downwards departures,

14

so I have always had trouble knowing what

15

provision of the statute anybody severs.

16

understand your saying that there's a bunch of

17

unconstitutional applications of the statute, and

18

you have to set aside the sentences in those

19

particular cases, but I simply don't understand

20

severing a single provision that covers both

21

upward and downward departures.

22

it?

23

I can

How do you sever

MS. SCAPICCHIO: Well, I think you sever it

24

by severing out the unconstitutional portions of

25

it.

And you sever it by getting rid of anything

95

1

that indicates that it's a judicial fact

2

finding by a preponderance of the evidence.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's the same,

4

that's the same provision that allows departures

5

for the same -- by the same procedure.

6
7
8
9

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Well, the departures in ­

-JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you're not
severing a piece of a statute, you're just

10

severing a bunch of applications of the statute

11

you think are invalid.

12

MS. SCAPICCHIO: The applications of the

13

statute that are invalid in this case are the ones

14

that require judicial fact finding by a

15

preponderance of the evidence.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Correct.

I understand.

Those under Blakely need

18

to be severed.

19

statute that needs to, that needs to function in

20

terms of saving the guidelines.

21

What we're left with now is a

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But would it -­

22

would it really

save the guidelines in the way

23

that Congress intended them, to strike basically

24

the provision for enhancements, and leaving in

25

place the provisions for downward departures?

96

1

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

It's not going to operate

2

exactly the way Congress intended.

3

Congress never intended to pass a statute that was

4

unconstitutional.

5

change.

6

saying is, minimize the amount of changes that the

7

statute has to undergo in order to preserve it.

8
9
10

Because

And so it has to undergo some

And in this particular case, what we're

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, maybe we should

just leave it to Congress to decide, because it
doesn't sound like the scheme Congress intended.

11

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Well, Congress intended a

12

mandatory system.

It's clear that Congress

13

intended a mandatory system.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The Government -­
And it intended fact

15

finding by a preponderance for both upward

16

adjustments and downward.

17

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Not necessarily fact

18

finding by the judiciary.

It's not one of the

19

listed goals of the sentencing reform act.

20

listed goals are uniformity, proportionality and

21

certainty, and those goals can still be met under

22

the proposal that we're suggesting the Court

23

adopt.

24

sentencing, there will still be proportionality

25

and there will still be certainty of sentence.

Those

There will still be uniformity in

97

1

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but will

2

there be proportionality if the sentences,

3

sentences can be downward, the jury verdict could

4

be adjusted downward, but not upward?

5

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

If it turns out, Mr.

6

Chief Justice, that there is some, some difference

7

in the severity of a sentence that a defendant

8

receives, certainly Congress could, could come in

9

and make the appropriate changes if that's the

10

result of the proposal that we're suggesting, but

11

the proportionality wouldn't change.

12

the degree of crimes is still going to line up in

13

the exact same manner.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You know,

But you can say

15

the same thing if we simply said that the whole

16

guidelines fall, and they're simply

17

judges to apply if they wish. You can say, "Well,

18

if Congress doesn't like that they can come in and

19

put a new system." That's true any time Congress

20

acts.

there for

21

MS. SCAPICCHIO: But -- absolutely, Mr.

22

Chief Justice, it is true any time Congress acts,

23

but in this particular case, the Government has

24

the burden of proving the inseverability of the

25

statute.

We're attempting to show that the

98

1

statute is severable to save the guidelines in

2

this case, and we're attempting to show that by

3

suggesting to the Court that you don't have to

4

throw out twenty years of sentencing reform.

5

the guidelines should still be mandatory; we're

6

suggesting that the mandatory portions of the

7

guidelines remain, the bulk of the guidelines

8

remain, and we're changing the fact finder.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That

Why do you -- why do you

10

have to call it severability?

Suppose we just

11

said it's clear that whenever these facts have not

12

been found by a jury, the guidelines cannot be

13

applied?

14

unconstitutional, as applied, when there's been no

15

jury finding, and leave it.

16

any particular language, we're just saying that

17

that portion, that proceeding in that fashion

18

produces an unconstitutional sentence.

19

let the Government work out how it wants to find

20

its way around that problem.

That the guidelines are

We're not severing

21

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

22

option that the Court could consider.

23

And then

That's certainly an

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just not sure, I share

24

Justice Stevens' perplexity as to whether that's

25

really properly described as severing part of the

99

1

statute.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And may I add this

3

thought, that it seems to me, I don't know whether

4

this is true; Mr. Clement and I had a dialogue

5

that was inconclusive; I had been under the

6

impression, perhaps erroneous, that in fact the

7

number of unconstitutional departures if one

8

follows Apprendi as being the constitutional rule,

9

is actually a small percentage of the total, and

10

if it should follow that only three, four, five,

11

six percent of the sentences that have heretofore

12

been imposed or will be imposed in the future

13

would be unconstitutional, that's a pretty weak

14

reason for saying the whole statute is

15

unconstitutional on its face, or even in one

16

provision of the statute.

17

say, "Oh, okay, you can't impose those sentences

18

in those three percent of the cases."

19

know why that's a departure from our prior

20

practice.

21

It seems to me you just

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

I don't

I, Well, I think because

22

what's left is, is that the system will then be

23

open to some manipulation, under that scenario.

24

If the Government can control who it is that will

25

be sentenced under the guidelines and who will not

100

1

be sentenced under the guidelines, then the system

2

is, is ripe for manipulation.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, my suggestion is

4

everybody is going to be sentenced under the Guidelines;

5

the only difference is that in three or four

6

percent of the cases you may have to bring a jury

7

in to get an enhanced sentence.

8
9

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

In, under that scenario,

if any fact that needed to increase a defendant's

10

sentence was pled and proved to a jury, that would

11

suffice.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You wouldn't care whether

13

you call this severing, severability or not, would

14

you?

15

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Absolutely not.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't think you would.

17

MS. SCAPICCHIO: It produces the same

18

results, whether it's, you call it severance or

19

the way that the statute works.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I assume, don't you,

21

that any solution we come up to is likely to be an

22

interim solution anyway?

23

MS. SCAPICCHIO: It's very likely to be

24

an interim solution and the legislature will tell us

25

what they really want us to do and we'll all make

101

1

the appropriate adjustments.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

works because most cases are plea bargained.

4
5
6

But the idea is that this

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Most cases are plea

bargained.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what you'll do if

7

you're right, is all you would say is any time

8

that the prosecutor wants to say that you

9

committed the bank robbery or you committed the

10

drug offense with more than a minimal amount of

11

money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or

12

there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they

13

end up with a sentence once they bargain -- if

14

that's the sentence, because they're not even

15

going to contest it before the judge, both sides

16

will come in and agree.

17

where they do contest it, you would have to have

18

the jury find the facts.

But in those few cases

19

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, the only reason that

21

I find it disturbing is to think that Congress

22

could have wanted such a system is given other

23

developments in Congress, mandatory minimums and

24

all kinds of things, that seems to me to be a

25

system that would really, might make non­

102

1

uniformity in reality, worse than it was before

2

1986.

3

prosecutor's going to be doing something

4

different, every defense attorney; everything will

5

depend upon the bargains.

6

come in will think different things.

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Should we uphold

See, I mean, my goodness, every

The judges when they
I mean -­

something like that in the face of a Congress that
wanted uniformity?

11

MS. SCAPICCHIO:

Yes, and I'll tell you

12

why.

Because that's exactly the way that the

13

guidelines operate now.

14

changing is the identity of the fact finder.

15

the Government can come in now and charge whatever

16

it wants, because it's free to charge whatever it

17

wants, and that, the Government in this case, or

18

in any case, could then bargain with defense

19

counsel and the defendant as to which facts they

20

may want to plead to, as to which portions of the

21

indictment they may want to plead to, happens

22

every day.

23

changing the identity of the fact finder isn't

24

going to change that process at all.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The only thing that's
That

And, and, and so, if that's the case,

103

Did you find out anything

1

in your research on this where anybody in the -­

2

this discussion on the guidelines began, I think,

3

in the early 70's, it's been around for 30 years.

4

The guidelines have been law for 17 years, and

5

until recently with Apprendi, is there a history

6

of anything being written

7

being unconstitutional for the Sixth Amendment

8

reason?

9

attorneys, or academics or anybody write anything

on the guidelines

Did any group of judges, or defense

that we could look at until quite recently in

which they thought this was a possibility?

MS. SCAPICCHIO: Before quite -- before
this Court's decision in Apprendi?

And with respect to Mr.

Fanfan in this case, Your Honors, we're asking

that this Court give intelligible content to the

jury's verdict by affirming the district court's

2

imposition of a 78-month sentence based solely on

the facts found by the jury beyond a reasonable

doubt.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask just one, one

guidelines ranges, which sometimes are fairly

large, the judge does have the discretion to

impose any sentences he wants to based on the

conduct of the defendant, whether or not it's

proved by the jury?

12
13

Do you agree that within the

range?

Within the guideline

Yes.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS: You get to the range by

the jury finding, the judge still retains

16

substantial discretion within the, within the

range.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you Ms.

Mr. Clement, you have four minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

105

1
2
3

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
This Court in Mistretta expressed its

4

understanding that the commission was

5

constitutional because it would pursue traditional

6

judicial tasks related to sentencing, and it would

7

not get involved in quintessentially legislative

8

acts of setting maximum penalties, or defining the

9

elements of the crime.

Now, we of course, think

10

that's quite relevant for the Sixth Amendment

11

issue that's raised in question one; but even if

12

you disagree with us on that, even if you think

13

the non-legislative origins of the guidelines

14

don't matter for purposes of question one, surely

15

they do matter for purposes of the severability

16

analysis under question two.

17

those elements, those enhancement factors in the

18

guidelines, and treats them like true elements of

19

crimes that must go to the jury, then you are

20

giving this non-legislative body's work product

21

the effect of Federal criminal statutes, and

22

that's something that not only Mistretta suggests

23

is problematic, but United States v. Hudson in

24

1812 suggests is problematic.

25

really breathtaking; it is an understatement to

106

Because if one takes

And the effect is

1

say that the effect of that judicial remedial

2

decision would be to create thousands of new

3

Federal crimes.

4

Now, let me talk just for a second about

5

the language of severability.

There's been some

6

questions about whether what we're really talking

7

about is severability.

8

to have some cases where there's going to be no

9

enhancing factor at all.

First of all you're going

And in those cases you

10

don't need to talk about severability.

11

no Sixth Amendment issue raised in a case, there's

12

no reason to strike anything down and that would

13

be a simple matter of traditional principles of

14

third party standing and facial challenges. The

15

fact that you might have a constitutional problem

16

in this case, doesn't mean that you invalidate the

17

guidelines in those other cases, where they apply

18

without problem.

19

If there's

The real question becomes, what do you do

20

in a case where there is a Sixth Amendment

21

problem, assuming Blakely applies to the

22

guidelines?

23

is the right way to talk about it.

24

dealing with the case at the point you recognize

25

there's a Sixth Amendment problem in this case is

At that point, I think severability

107

One way of

1

to say, "Well, there's nothing we can do about it,

2

we can't sentence this individual to any more than

3

the upper bound of the sentencing range."

4

second thing you can do is you can say, "Well,

5

okay, there's a constitutional problem, but the

6

result is that we sever 3553(b), we don't make the

7

guidelines mandatory, and we allow the judge to

8

impose a discretionary sentence within the range

9

of the statute."

10
11

The

That is what we think is the

appropriate solution.
As a couple of you have mentioned, what we

12

may be talking about here is an interim solution

13

Anyway. Congress may well get involved.

14

why in considering what regime of remediability or

15

severability best serves the interests of Congress

16

in uniformity and proportionality, it pays to pay

17

particular attention to the cases that are in the

18

pipeline now.

19

question which proposal better serves the interest

20

of uniformity and proportionality. Respondents

21

have to admit that they are seeking a huge

22

sentencing windfall here.

23

That's

And on those cases, there's no

One other point that bears mention is this

24

idea of, the suggestion that because the

25

guidelines will not be binding in every case, the

108

1

Government somehow controls the decision as to

2

whether or not it's a guidelines case or not.

3

That is not the case.

4

system will rest with the judge.

5

enhancement sought, but it's not found in the

6

basis of the judge, then there's no Sixth

7

Amendment problem in that case, and the case can

8

go forward.

9

That decision under the
If there is an

The irony, of course, is that the

10

consequence of applying Blakely to the guidelines

11

is to create more power with the prosecutor,

12

because as Justice Breyer pointed out, under the

13

current system of the guidelines, the prosecutor

14

cannot control through the indictment exactly what

15

sentencing factors the judge will consider.

16

Burns case, for example, that this Court had

17

involved a situation where the judge sua sponte took

18

notice of sentencing factors that neither the

19

prosecutor nor the defendant very much wanted in

20

front of the court.

21

possible under a system where everything has to be

22

in the indictment, so the result is to strengthen

23

the hand of the Government.

24
25

The

That will no longer be

The last thing is this idea of bifurcation
is not a panacea.

I know Justice Scalia, you've

109

1

thrown that out in a number of instances, but the

2

traditional rule in cases with real elements of

3

real Federal crimes is that you don't get to

4

bifurcate out one element that the defendant

5

doesn't want to put before the jury.

6

that's the binding law in cases like Collamore out

7

of the First Circuit and Barker out of the Ninth

8

Circuit.

9

that bifurcation is going to solve all these

10
11
12
13
14

problems.

That's the,

So, I think it's wrong to simply suggest that,
