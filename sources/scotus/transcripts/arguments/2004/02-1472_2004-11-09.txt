ON BEHALF OF THE CHEROKEE NATION

AND SHOSHONE-PAIUTE TRIBES

12

MR. MILLER:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
These two contract cases concern whether the

13

Government is liable in money damages under the Contract

14

Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-

15

Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a

16

contract price for the --

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Would you mind explaining to

18

us how these two cases relate?

19

the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth

20

Circuit went another.

21

overlapping?

22

The Court of Appeals for

And are the claims at all

How are they differentiated?

MR. MILLER:

No, Justice O'Connor.

They're --

23

they're not overlapping.

The claims in the Federal

24

Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal

25

years 1994, 1995, and 1996.

And the Cherokee contract at

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is

fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement.

7

The section -- remedial section of the act,
section 110 -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But they're certainly at odds

on the legal theory.
MR. MILLER:

Yes, they are, Your Honor.

The

8

Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government

9

contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract

10

payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation,

11

the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is

12

enacted by Congress.

13

And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian

14

Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the

15

contracts in this case under the circumstances presented.

16

And to the contrary.

17

construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo

18

section 106(b) of the act --

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We submit that the Secretary's

Are the circumstances any

20

different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case

21

and the one in the Federal Circuit?

22

circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any

23

respect that could account for a difference in outcome?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

Are -- are the

No, Justice O'Connor.

There --

there is no difference in that respect, and there is an
5
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

overlap in -- in this sense.

2

that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve

3

fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee

4

contract that covered fiscal year 1996.

5

both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues.

6

The Shoshone-Paiute contract

So in that sense,

The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of

7

the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to

8

our opening blue brief.

9

section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons:

The act was amended in this

10

secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal

11

bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding

12

discretion over contract funding issues.

13

to

In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of

14

the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount

15

of funds provided under the terms of self-determination

16

contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall

17

not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have

18

otherwise provided.

19

And then directly pertinent to this case is

20

subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses

21

contract support costs.

22

amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs

23

which shall consist of certain items.

24

items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs,

25

procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for

There shall be added to the

Incidentally, these

the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or

2

personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by

3

the Office of Personnel Management.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

Does the -- do the actual

contracts reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount or --

6

MR. MILLER:

Yes, they do.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so we know -- they --

8

they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it

9

was going to cost.

10

MR. MILLER:

That is correct, Justice Souter.

11

In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the

12

parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they

13

entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated

14

contract amount.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't want to get ahead of

16

you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the

17

question if -- if you choose.

18

to (a).

19

Government used some of the funds that otherwise would

20

have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of

21

health contracts and that that's what's in dispute?

22

was it just general overhead for other programs it used?

23

But it seems to me relevant

Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the

MR. MILLER:

Or

It -- it is precisely, Justice

24

Kennedy, what -- what you stated.

25

directly to page 14a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I stated an or.

I --

what I -- I stated at the outset?
MR. MILLER:

The -- the Government took money

4

for its own Federal functions instead of -- including

5

contract monitoring --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. MILLER:

Including contract monitoring.

Including contract monitoring.

8

Including contract monitoring.

9

their brief and -- and defend that action.

10

In fact, they say so in

The -- the sections on page 12a and 13a

11

articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the

12

contract support costs that must be added.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

These are strange contracts, of

14

course, aren't they?

I mean, are there any other

15

contracts that the Government has to enter into?

16

the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to

17

take over, in effect, implementation of the -- of a

18

Federal health program, doesn't he?

19

MR. MILLER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
Well, I -- why would you expect

21

that this strange kind of contract should -- should, prima

22

facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations

23

as other contracts --

24

MR. MILLER:

Because --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- where -- where an agency,
8

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will

2

limit the number of contracts it enters into?

3

here you're creating a situation where the agency has to

4

contract and yet has no control over having enough money

5

to -- to meet the contractual obligations.

6

a -- a strange way to run a railroad.

7

MR. MILLER:

But -- but

It seems to me

It -- it is a unique contractual

8

situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully

9

anticipated.

10

And -- and I would explain it this way.

First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act

11

which Congress said applies to these contracts.

The

12

contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior

13

Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby

14

case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced

15

under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason

16

Justice Scalia articulated.

17

1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced

18

at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims,

19

then the Court of Claims, and the district courts

20

concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under

21

the Contract Disputes Act.

22

explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the

23

Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for

24

the stated contract price.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress changed that.

In

And the legislative history

But further to Justice
9

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves

2

contain clauses that say this is not a procurement

3

contract?

4

MR. MILLER:

5

that is correct.

6

Honor.

The -- the procurement contract --

Not the contracts themselves, Your

The -- the act says that --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

not procurement contracts.

9
10

MR. MILLER:

Oh, the act says that they're

-- the contracts are not

procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy.

That's correct.

11

These contracts began as procurement contracts.

12

They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they

13

were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board

14

of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision.

15

Congress relieved the contractors of the

16

procurement system because they felt that the agency had

17

built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which

18

it wanted to eliminate.

19

eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the

20

contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along

21

with it.

And for that reason, it

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. MILLER:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Mr. Miller, do --

Justice Ginsburg.
-- on -- on the

interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean
10
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or

2

generally to reserve some portion of this for what you

3

call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the

4

appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and

5

nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal

6

functions?

7

MR. MILLER:

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put

8

my answer in this context.

There are many sources from

9

which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these

10

contracts.

11

the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial

12

administration.

13

million increases Congress was making every year.

14

could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover

15

appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could

16

have been from the regional and headquarters offices that

17

the agencies had where they don't administer services.

18

It could have been, yes, as we submit, from

It could have been from the up to $88

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your -- your answer is,

19

yes, if it came to that, they --

20

MR. MILLER:

That's the duty Congress imposed

21

upon the Secretary.

22

reprogram.

23

and the Secretary made it.

24

ramifications of that choice and we submit --

25

It

The Secretary was free not to

That's -- that's a choice the Secretary had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is what are the

Well, let me ask you another

Alderson Reporting Company

question related.

action.

3

actions.

Suppose -- this is an individual

These are individual actions.

4

MR. MILLER:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They're not class

Correct, Your Honor.
Do the ones who come to court

6

to sue get paid in full even though there may be many

7

other self-determination contracts out there, and that if

8

you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be

9

paid in full?

10
11

Does it just depend on first come to court,

first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
MR. MILLER:

Your Honor, we -- we do not believe

12

that that -- that should be the outcome.

13

advantage the contractors that came forward and not take

14

account of the entire situation.

15

situation has to be looked at.

16

contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994 --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would

We think the global

The total amount of the

I mean, you can't get blood out

18

of a turnip.

19

question, what if there is not enough money to go around?

20
21

I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the

MR. MILLER:

If there were only sufficient money

to pay half of the contract shortfalls --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. MILLER:

Right.

-- without violating the clause and

24

the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce

25

appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other
12
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half

2

of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of

3

money.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Didn't the tribes get notice

5

they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and

6

so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their

7

spending?

8
9

MR. MILLER:
the contrary.

No, Justice Kennedy, and -- and to

In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health

10

Service was telling everybody they were paying them in

11

full.

12

everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in

13

the Government's brief.

14
15

They told the General Accounting Office they paid

But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So these -- these are reliance

damages in a sense.

16

MR. MILLER:

The -- the tribes expected to be

17

paid.

18

paid in full in the first year.

19

The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, they -- they were out

20

of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other

21

than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get

22

the full amount?

23

MR. MILLER:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

That is correct.

That is correct.

Well, when do the tribal

contractors know how much money the Government actually
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

will have available to spend?

2

MR. MILLER:

The contractors don't know until

3

the year is over because throughout the year, the

4

Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but

5

stated in a circular, to reprogram.

6

appropriations --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

that?

9

to reprogram.

10

And the

What -- what do you mean by

You said a second ago the Secretary had the option
What do you mean by reprogram?

MR. MILLER:

When the Secretary prepares a

11

budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum

12

amount of, say, $1.8 billion.

13

off the top or $300 million off the top because that was

14

specified by Congress for certain purposes.

15

balance is a lump sum.

16

The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar

17

amount is adopted by Congress.

18

and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap

19

it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.

20

We -- we take $400 million

But the

The Secretary crafts a budget.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, Congress can step in

Yes, but the -- the tribes

21

have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is

22

going to be there at the end of the day?

23

MR. MILLER:

The tribes enter into contracts, as

24

most Government contractors do when they enter into

25

contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if
14
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the agency will have the money to pay them.

2

The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the

3

availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the

4

appropriations.

5

that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is

6

entitled to be paid.

7

That's okay.

It's been the law for 120 years that at

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

All right.

So how was that

8

appropriation money in fact used by the Federal

9

Government, do you say?

10

MR. MILLER:

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MR. MILLER:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

14
15

The Federal Government --

Yes.

entered into contracts.
MR. MILLER:

There was the appropriation.

And the tribes had already

Now, how was that lump sum used?

The agency then, under this Court's

16

teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over

17

how it spends its appropriation except insofar as --

18
19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is that what you mean by

programming?

20

MR. MILLER:

Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for

21

taking me back to your question.

22

Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding

23

on the Secretary.

24

because Congress didn't adopt it.

25

change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts

What we mean is that the

It's not binding as a matter of law
And as conditions

its budget, which we call reprogramming.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.

4

MR. MILLER:

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. MILLER:

7

10

Correct.
Okay.

And the Secretary retains complete

discretion as this Court taught --

8
9

So programming is allocating

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And is that done without

regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have
entered into?

11

MR. MILLER:

12

regard to the contract amounts --

13
14

Well, it should not be done without

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
done?

15

MR. MILLER:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

Is that in fact how it was

That is in fact how it was done.
And is it still done that

way?

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, the times have changed.

19

Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on

20

the contracts and court costs that the agency has.

21

there's no question the agency cannot pay more than

22

Congress gives it.

23

million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's

24

it.

25

So

When Congress only gives it $100

The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But didn't -- didn't Congress,
16

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

even before that, impose a significant limitation on how

2

much the Secretary could pay?

3

provision in -- in (b) of -- of the section that you were

4

reading from?

5

subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter

6

is subject to the availability of appropriations and the

7

Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs,

8

projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds

9

available to another tribe or tribal organization under

What do you with the

Notwithstanding any other provision in this

10

this chapter.

11

Secretary expends is -- is not expended for programs,

12

projects, or activities that serve a tribe?

13

I mean, what -- what money that the

MR. MILLER:

Justice Scalia, we read this --

14

this clause with -- keeping in mind the first sentence

15

first of the sentence.

16

on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of

17

funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced

18

to make funding available for contract monitoring or

19

administration by the Secretary.

20

in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the

21

Secretary to pay for Federal functions.

22
23

The first sentence, which begins

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the subparagraph (3)

Well, that's all very good,

but --

24

MR. MILLER:

But then there's an exception.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- then the last paragraph
17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision

2

of this subchapter.

So this --

3

MR. MILLER:

We --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- it seems to me, overrides

5

everything else.

6

that that -- that that provision doesn't give the

7

Secretary the authority to -- to allocate the available

8

funds among other activities that serve tribes, I -- I

9

think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.

10
11

Unless -- unless you can persuade me

MR. MILLER:

Justice Scalia, for -- for two

reasons we think it cannot.

12

First of all, if that exception swallowed up the

13

rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the

14

whole purpose of the act.

15

And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a

16

mandatory rule of construction that Congress has

17

articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government

18

never cites in the statutory interpretation case.

19

this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the

20

act --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MILLER:

MR. MILLER:

that given the provisions you read earlier in this

there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and

14

squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed.

Is that your position?

MR. MILLER:

That is our position.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that is your position, do

you have to even grapple with difficulties about the

First

privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's

But more practically, let's look at the
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.

They took over a hospital that

had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract

support costs requirement was $2 million.

was in round numbers $7 million.

15

It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy.

16

didn't get the full hospital operational budget because

17

they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance,

undertaking the audits required by Federal law.

were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact,

that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.

It says, notwithstanding any other

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- I think that argument is

incorrect.

First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation

6

of the terms of the reduction clause.

the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the

agency functions, were available for contracting is

But second of all,

contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself.

And if

you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from

certain functions that are not otherwise contractable,

contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that

20

whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for

21

core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be

22

turned over.

23

I think it's more of a characterization
There -- it's true that in a descriptive

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say that.

It

doesn't say that.

What it says is otherwise contractable.

this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that

says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for

3

the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of

4

Interior.

5

otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.

Well, if it said that, then that's not

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So otherwise contractable

8
9

sounds like a -- a statutory question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it -- it's not talking

10

about money that's otherwise contractable.

It says,

11

including supportive administrative functions that are

12

otherwise contractable.

13

upon the contractability of functions --

It's talking about a limitation

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- not the use of funds.

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it's talking about both

17

because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the

18

amount of funds.

19

that are required to be transferred, and what it stands

20

for is that funds for supportive administrative functions

21

that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core

22

agency functions that the agency is required to perform

23

itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to

24

contracting tribes.

25

sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist

It's relating to the amount of funds

And that just reflects the common

to perform some core functions.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how do you -- how do you

3

square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as

4

Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make

5

funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or

6

administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by

7

the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but

8

not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls

9

under the heading Federal functions.

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Ginsburg, the way we

11

square that under the statute is that the leading -- the

12

initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of

13

funds required by subsection (a) of this section.

14

view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal

15

functions were never required to be transferred under

16

subsection (a) to begin with.

17

is the funds that are left over after the funds for

18

inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And our

And so what (b) deals with

So are these noninherent

20

Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal

21

functions?

22

noninherent?

23

So there's inherent Federal functions and

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Oh, absolutely there are.

The

24

Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could

25

essentially encompass everything the Federal Government

Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

does.

2

of functions that the agency itself is required to

3

perform.

4

functions and Federal functions, although it might seem

5

trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the

6

definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically

7

defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal

8

functions.

9

Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set

And the distinction between inherent Federal

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does it ever define them as

10

noncontractable?

I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I

11

suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're

12

talking about, but does it ever expressly get to --

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It -- it does.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- the point of

15

contractability?

It does, Justice Scalia --

Excuse me.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Thank you, but apologize to

(Laughter.)

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And we describe the -- the

22

relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me

23

for just one second, on page 31.

24

the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the

25

When Congress enacted

There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k).

3

provision reads that nothing in this section is intended

4

or shall be construed to expand or alter existing

5

statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to

6

enter into any agreement with respect to functions that

7

are inherently Federal.

8

is that there are some functions that are not contractable

9

and can't be turned over to the tribes.

10

And the

That -- that all may be true,

11

of course.

They're talking about don't contract out to

the Indians something that should be done in Washington.

13

But what has that got to do with the issue?

14

talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts.

15

People who enter into Government contracts need certainty.

They have to know whether that word, subject to

appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they

have a valid contract.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Breyer, one background

principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms

3

of the contracts themselves.

4

that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required

5

to be transferred to tribes.

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

One background principle is

And the contracts -Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you

7

say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and

the tribes did somehow contract away Federal -- inherent

No.

with that.

violate that section.

19

the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government

No.

The -- that's correct,

Justice O'Connor.

What I'm responding to is the

suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary

to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be

addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are

Correct.
That's where your argument is

going.

administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I -You said that -Can I ask you sort of a basic

24

question that I'm having trouble following?

As I

25

understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and

2

so forth that can't be reduced.

3

the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from

4

allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Now, is there anything in

Well, there is, Justice

6

Stevens, in the following sense.

7

that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing

8

the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not at all the case

But his budget that he

10

actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated

11

by the statute, as I understand.

12
13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

In -- in part it was mandated

by the statute.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

In part but not in whole.
Perhaps not in whole -Well, that's the point.
-- but at least in significant

18

part.

19

if I can just walk the Court through the process by which

20

the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately

21

is allocated.

22

And let me -- but I think this is significant, and

The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA

23

and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation

24

across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the

25

next year's allocation will be built.

And that's

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a

2

of the appendix to the blue brief.

3

450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred

4

to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in

5

subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited

6

criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is

7

the reduction in appropriations.

8

with that in the relevant fiscal years.

9

an increase.

There's a provision,

But we're not dealing
There was always

And so the Secretary, pursuant to the

10

statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at

11

the level that it was at the previous fiscal year.

12

Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds

13

two -- two considerations on top.

The first is mandatory

14

across-the-board increases for things such as salary

15

COLA's and inflationary adjustments.

16

standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in

17

the terms of the statute.

18

to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where

19

we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that's a

And that -- I'd point the Court

Is the -- is the nub of what

21

you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in

22

fact, mandated by a statute?

principal part it was mandated by the -- by -JUSTICE STEVENS:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, let -Does that mean that there was

not enough?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

-- and had enough money -Sorry.
-- to pay these contract

obligations.

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, Justice Stevens.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, the thing that troubles

15

me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the

16

contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can

17

always allocate funds to all these other projects and say,

18

well, we've already used up the money.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I don't think that they

20

have discretion to do that.

21

explain.

22

and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated

23

by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his

24

budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done.

25

And that's what I'm trying to

At least with respect to the existing baseline

With respect to the mandatory across-the-board
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C.

2

1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the

3

administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires

4

the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for,

5

quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote,

6

other expenses relating to the provision of health

7

services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such

8

funds are provided to programs and services operated

9

directly.

In other words, with respect to mandatory

10

across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate

11

those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-

12

contracting tribes.

13

And that leaves the additional set of an

14

increase from one year to the next year that deals with

15

specific targeted items, and principally that would

16

include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come

17

on board during the course of a particular fiscal year.

18

And with respect to those specific targeted items, the

19

critical point is that the contracting tribes often

20

benefit from the addition of those and from the

21

enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks.

22

For example, in this particular case, the -- one

23

of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic

24

in Oklahoma.

25

in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the

That was a new facility that came on board

4

budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation

7

honored.

10

Now, the staffing for that

And it, of course, is in the Cherokee

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you telling me that the

committee reports are -- are binding law?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

They're not binding law,

11

Justice Stevens.

12

same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do

13

was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the

14

committee reports.

15

We fully recognize that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But at the

But you got a conflict

16

apparently between the committee reports and what seems to

17

be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these

18

contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental

19

agreements.

20

contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.

21

And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's not just the committee

22

reports, Justice Souter.

It's the reduction clause.

The

23

reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has

24

ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the

25

proper interpretation of the contract.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and their -- their

2

argument is that you can pay the contract amount without

3

robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the

4

nonreduction clause refers to.

5

they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy,

6

get squeezed.

7

and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to

8

Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're

9

getting squeezed out of existence.

10

Yes.

They are saying -- I think

And if so, the contract comes first

I think that's what

they're saying.

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That is what they're saying,

12

Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's

13

incorrect.

14

separate types of bureaucracy.

15

bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions.

16

one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required

17

to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to

18

perform those functions.

19

The Government bureaucracy consists of two

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's that core

No, he's not.

And

But if -- if --

20

where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like

21

-- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why

22

I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I -- I read here -- look, the

question really is was this money like the bureaucracy
47
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

money.

Is it legally speaking an appropriation available,

2

not practically speaking but legally?

3

to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you

4

say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes.

5

I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who

6

really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals.

7

So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a

8

point of normal contract law is legally available, I

9

promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right.

And here it seems

And so

So I

10

might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now

11

why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because, Justice Breyer, I

13

think the core of it is that even if you think that

14

they're right, that these funds are legally available,

15

that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA

16

specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that

17

he not be required to reduce funding for programs,

18

projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make

19

funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there is -- is -- the

21

kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be

22

taken for the other.

23

Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still

24

enough money left over.

25

you should take money from one tribe to give it to

But I thought the Board of Contract

Am I wrong about that?

I thought

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

another.

What did they think?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

They thought -- the -- the

3

board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the

4

Board of Contract Appeals, thought --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

Well, I'm thinking the Board of

Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't think the Board

8

of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with

9

where the funds were coming from.

10
11

They just thought that

legal availability would be sufficient.
Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that

12

funds for inherent Federal functions are available.

13

we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said.

14

think those funds ever came into the group of funds that

15

were subject to be transferred to begin with.

16

you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds

17

for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs,

18

projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that

19

one example of a core Federal function --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't

But even if

No, but if that's true, then

21

everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS

22

bureaucracy qualifies.

23

swallows the entire budget.

24
25

And

I mean, that swallows the -- that

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, let's -- Justice Souter,

3

conceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- the

4

implication of what you're saying?

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you can't limit it to

6

inherent Government functions.

Both the inherent and the

7

noninherent Government functions would fall within this

8

provision --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- if you read it as broadly as

11
12

you've just read it.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- I guess the way I'd

13

like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds

14

that they point to, which include inherent Federal

15

functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function

16

bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs

17

that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal

18

Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or

19

activities serving a tribe.

20

With respect to the administrative support --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On -- on that point -- on

22

that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed

23

considerable displeasure with the Government because he

24

said three times I said, tell me what existing programs

25

with other tribes would have been reduced if these
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

contract support costs are paid in full.

2

asked them again and again and again, and they were

3

unresponsive.

4

the court what programs -- existing programs with other

5

tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I

6

think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is

7

unavailable and no existing program with other tribes

8

would have been diminished?

9

And he said, I

So since the Government declined to tell

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't -- I don't think so,

10

Justice Ginsburg.

I mean, one straightforward reason why

11

you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not

12

only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court,

13

it's also the Tenth Circuit case.

14

are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that

15

specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay

16

for the contract support costs of these tribes would have

17

required reducing funds for programs, projects, or

18

activities serving a tribe.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there's -- there

Now, what does that mean?

So -I mean, one thing is existing

22

contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then

23

another thing is, well, we think that there's a new

program that could be good for some tribe.

25

to put that new program in and say that that steps in

has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government

is at liberty to benefit tribes?

necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the

24

baseline.

25

the current year's appropriation allocation which takes

3

that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-

contracted programs and noncontracted programs.

that provision means is that the reduction takes into

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you

12

alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg,

13

I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case

14

that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce

15

funds available for other programs.

16

declarations get specific in the way that her original

17

question was -- was asking about?

18

declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for

19

the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe

20

and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say,

21

as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations

22

for other tribes?

23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Did those

Well, they -- they make the

point as a general matter, and they also give an example.

existing program?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's an -- the -- the

6

particular example is an existing program.

7

it's more --

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think

It seems to me you can

9

interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did

10

not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we

11

now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.

12
13
14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You're -- you're speaking with

particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

It seems to me that you

15

can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the

16

Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough

17

room for all the programs it wants to support in the

18

current year and continuing to honor the obligations under

19

the existing contracts.

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't think that even

21

with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough

22

money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract

23

support costs.

24

in contract support costs, for example, in 1997

25

cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more

If you look at the figures, the shortfall

54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996

2

to FY 1997.

3

by the Government for inherent Federal functions.

4

even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be

5

sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.

Is there some way to avoid

Has anything changed?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice O'Connor, Congress

changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit

10

statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning

11

with 1998.

12

did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.

13

It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why was there that difference

14

between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and

15

not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think the difference lies in

17

the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.

18

My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in

19

BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become

20

evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.

21

And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the

22

two.

23

But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in

24

the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the

25

1999 Appropriations Act.

And I think, if nothing else,
55

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a

2

subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme

3

from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his

4

discretion under the ISDA.

5

decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination

6

by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great

7

weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately

8

exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997.

9

thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary

And under this Court's

So even if you

10

had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA,

11

I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation

12

Act that its view was that Secretary had done so

13

legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our

14

favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.

15

I want to address really quickly, if I could,

16

the notion that the funds for administrative support for

17

programs that are administered directly by the Federal

18

Government are available.

19

consequences because one of the policies underlying the

20

act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that

21

are currently entered into self-determination contracts,

22

but it's to protect the amounts that are available to

23

tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-

24

determination contracts.

25

the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of

5

amounts that were available for potentially contracting

tribes in future years.
