Mr. Nolas.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. NOLAS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Profound mitigating evidence concerning Mr.

11

Rompilla's life history was not heard by the capital

12

sentencing jury in this case because his trial counsel did

13

not secure a single scrap of paper about his life history.

14

As to the trial prosecutor, his argument, what

15

he elicited from the defense witnesses, and what he

16

presented affirmatively sent the message to this jury of

17

future dangerousness.

18

When the jury inquired whether in Pennsylvania

19

there is parole from a life sentence, they were not given

20

the simple, straight answer that Pennsylvania law clearly

21

indicates, no.

22

question was not answered.

Instead, they were told -- instead, their

23

What I would like to do, unless the Court has

24

specific inquiries, is to make certain points about the

25

ineffectiveness issue and then turn to the sentence issue.

Page 3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

As to the ineffectiveness issue, Your Honors,

2

this Court has made very clear in Williams v. Taylor, in

3

Wiggins v. Smith, reiterating the concept established

4

originally in Strickland v. Washington, that a trial

5

defense counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough

6

investigation for mitigating evidence in a capital case.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you're asking us, I

8

suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper

9

records.

We've seen a number of capital cases, you know

10

-- as you know.

11

articulate and -- and had a very sound theory of -- to

12

argue to the jury for mitigation.

13

course.

14

you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record

15

evidence?

16

This counsel seemed to me to be quite

It didn't work, of

I -- I just don't know what constitutional rule

MR. NOLAS:

We are not asking the Court to set a

17

constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must

18

obtain records in every capital case.

19

Court to apply the rule articulated in Strickland v.

20

Washington itself where the Court indicated that counsel

21

has a duty to make a reasonable investigation.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We are asking this

Well, you had three forensic

23

experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think

24

the papers were relevant either.

25

MR. NOLAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as to the

Page 4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

experts themselves -- and that's actually -- the experts

2

and the family are the core of respondent's argument

3

against Mr. Simmons' claim.

4

The simplest answer is to look at Wiggins v.

5

Smith where this Court held very clearly that the

6

retention of mental health experts sheds no light on the

7

reasonableness of counsel's life history investigation.

8

That is especially appropriate in this case because in

9

this case the counsel who had contact with the experts

10

testified very clearly at the post-conviction hearing that

11

the experts were never asked -- never asked -- to develop

12

life history mitigating evidence.

13

Zapp, indicates in her brief at page 43, there was no

14

tactical decision in this case by counsel to not pursue

15

life history mitigating evidence.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And as my friend, Ms.

Well, counsel -- counsel did

17

make use of several relatives of the defendant who

18

testified.

19

relatives who testified?

I -- I think weren't there about four

20

MR. NOLAS:

Yes, Your Honor, including his son.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And he talked to all of them

22

and talked to the defendant as well.

23

reasonable person think that's enough to find out family

24

history and -- and the concerns that you had?

25

MR. NOLAS:

So would a

This Court made very clear in

Page 5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Strickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment

2

of counsel's representation must be done from counsel's

3

perspective at the time.

time, as Ms. Dantos clearly testified at the hearing, was

5

that the family were not good sources of information for

6

petitioner's life history.

He was in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the -- the portions of

2

his life history that -- that are the most appealing are

3

the portions from his youth, before he went into the -足

4

into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly

5

with him during that period.

6

MR. NOLAS:

And third and most significantly,

7

Justice Scalia, she testified that they were not willing

8

to provide life history mitigating -- facts about his life

9

history because of, quote, whatever else was going on with

10

them, unquote.

11

it, these were not the type of family that would provide

12

information when asked.

13

Or as Mr. Charles, the other attorney, put

Bear in mind, both of these counsel knew what

14

the respondent's post-conviction rebuttal psychologist

15

testified to, that when you're dealing with abuse,

16

neglect, a dysfunctional home, people don't want to talk

17

about that.

They want to withhold that.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me -- let me take you back

19

to the -- to the experts.

20

ask the experts to go -- to go into his childhood

21

problems.

22

on the stand, the first question being asked is, now, Mr.

23

Expert, were you told by counsel to look into the

24

childhood problems?

25

planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say.

You say he did not specifically

You know, as though counsel were

What would anyone who hires a psychologist or a

2

psychiatrist -- what would anyone expect him to look into

3

in -- in determining whether the person is -- is mentally

4

injured but -- but the childhood?

5

counsel could not have expected with total assurance that

6

these people would do that?

7

MR. NOLAS:

Do you really think

Sure, because counsel themselves

8

testified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the

9

experts themselves said -- now, let me --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. NOLAS:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Nolas?

Yes, Your Honor.
Wasn't it the case that those

13

experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for

14

mitigation purposes?

15

the possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number

16

one, that he was insane at the time he committed the

17

crime, in which case what he was when he was a child would

18

be irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently

19

incompetent to stand trial.

20

specifically to inquire into his present mental situation,

21

and their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the

22

trial.

23

-- why are we engaging you?

24

do we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a

25

basis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.

MR. NOLAS:

Yes, Your Honor, and the -- the

2

respondents use the word mitigation that Ms. Dantos used

3

in her testimony.

4

joint appendix at page 472 where Ms. Dantos says very

5

clearly, I explained to them the purpose for my contacting

6

them, and the purpose was to initially see if there was

7

any issue of mental infirmity or mental insanity for the

8

guilt phase and subsequently to possibly use in mitigation

9

any mental infirmity if it -- if the jury came back first

10

I only ask the Court to look at the

degree.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was there any indication that

12

after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing

13

phase began -- I take it it was just a matter of hours or

14

almost days till the sentencing -- till the sentencing

15

phase began.

16

or with experts after the sentencing phase and the -足

17

pardon me -- after the guilt phase and before the

18

sentencing phase?

19

Was there any contact with the psychiatrists

MR. NOLAS:

No, Your Honor.

The record is very

20

clear that the experts were asked, as Justice Ginsburg

21

indicated, about mental infirmity at the time of the

22

offense.

23

assistance in that regard, and then there was not further

24

contact with them.

could look through Mr. Charles' entire testimony at the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

found that counsel had failed to provide reasonably

diligent effective assistance because counsel had not

developed life history mitigating evidence.

In Wiggins v. Smith, counsel hired a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Nolas, you haven't

that he should abstain from alcohol.

MR. NOLAS:

They testified that what they did

they asked -- they asked the other experts to look into

7

it.

8
9

And bear in mind, all of the experts in this
case had less than the expert in Wiggins.

All of the

10

experts in this case had less than the expert in Williams.

11

What these lawyers gave the expert is a client that they

12

themselves said is not a reliable source of information, a

13

client who did not want to discuss his life history, a

14

client who misled counsel, a client who these lawyers said

15

we can't rely on -- on this fellow.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Nolas, there were some

17

records that the prosecution sought and used.

18

the records that were in the very courthouse.

19

MR. NOLAS:

Was it -足

Yes, Your Honor, and that was, I

20

guess, the simplest way to respond to Justice Kennedy's

21

original question, which is what is the duty that these

22

lawyers have.

23

Court said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough

24

investigation for mitigating evidence, a thorough

25

investigation into the aggravation.

Well, at its simplest, in Wiggins this

They would have found achievement

21

that Mr. Rompilla had never progressed beyond the third

22

grade, indicating that he functions below 96 percent of

alcoholic, bearing in mind Dr. Gross' original inquiry.

3

These are also lawyers who knew that Mr. Rompilla had a

4

juvenile history and had a prior adult criminal history.

5

And Pennsylvania lawyers know -- we've discussed

6

this in the brief -- that PSI records, presentence reports

7

in Pennsylvania, and juvenile records are very special

8

things compared to such records in other States.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In -足

Mr. Nolas, are you telling us

10

that all that information would have -- was in the file

prosecutor used in his case?

MR. NOLAS:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15
16

indulgence for a moment.

Yes, Your Honor.

conviction court file contained records that were produced

when Mr. Rompilla was evaluated for that prior conviction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about a rule that says you

must consult the file of the case that's being used by the

prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance,

at least where that file is readily available, and you

All right.

Pennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to

MR. NOLAS:

The -- the only that's special to

Pennsylvania is what Pennsylvania law tells you you're

going to find in those files.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For what purpose did the

MR. NOLAS:

The prosecution told counsel I'm

use them for aggravation purposes.

for aggravation.

situation where the case, by my suggestion in any event,

was properly presented to the jury, and the only question

3

is what the constitutional obligation is once the jury

brings in a question.

5

MR. NOLAS:

The constitutional obligation under

6

Simmons itself would be to say is there something here or

in -- in the words of Justice O'Connor, did the State put

future dangerousness in issue.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

mean, there -- there were arguments about his behavior,

here is that the Kelly case had not yet been decided, and

13

you now have the AEDPA situation of trying to show that

the State court's resolution was objectively unreasonable.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what's the best argument

you have that future dangerousness was an issue?

7

MR. NOLAS:

There are several factors in that

regard, Your Honor.

As to the argument itself, the

prosecutor called Mr. Rompilla a very strong individual, a

very violent individual.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

blameworthiness.

20

MR. NOLAS:

Justice Kennedy, he sent the clear

21

signal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening

22

man, and then he tied it all together with this comment.

23

And I think he learned a lesson from his prior -- prior

24

crime, and that lesson was don't leave any witnesses.

25

Don't leave anybody behind that can testify against you.

that argument indicates to a reasonable jury future

dangerousness as much as the argument in Simmons itself -足

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you imagine any capital

12

dangerousness is not at issue?

13

the depravity of the defendant, what a horrible crime it

14

was, you're going to be able to make the same argument.

15

Any jury is going to be frightened of this man and think

16

he's going to be dangerous in the future.

17

-- if that's all that Simmons means, we should just say in

all capital cases, you assume that it's at issue.

I don't think so at all.

MR. NOLAS:

When you tell a jury that a person

is a violent recidivist who learns the lesson -- he's a

recidivist.

The lesson he learns is when he commits those more crimes,

He's going to commit more crimes if he's out.

I -- I see that as an argument that -- that is

far beyond Simmons itself as to future dangerousness.

future dangerousness, Justice Scalia, you -- you argued in

the dissent that the future dangerousness -- that what the

dangerousness argument could have had another purpose.

The ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in
this case, which denied the petitioner relief under

Simmons v. South Carolina, was objectively reasonable and

therefore did not provide a basis for habeas relief.

Simmons could reasonably be understood to

situations where the prosecution had argued that the

defendant posed a future danger when it was asking the

jury to sentence him to death.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Simmons was a narrow

position that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor

aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how

the defendant had learned from his prior crime -- do you

arguments that suggested future dangerousness?

MS. ZAPP:

I do, Your Honor.

And my -- my

reason for that is when you look to the argument itself,

3

those words were used in a very controlled situation.

4

They -- they did not by their tone or the overall tenor of

5

the argument or their content tell the jury to take the -足

the defendant's future dangerousness into account.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

agree that the argument was this person has committed

repeated crimes.

for the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating

factors.

has learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. ZAPP:

Court's instruction that an -- about a charge on all

8

ineligibility had to be supplied, and I'm going to quote

9

from the Court's opinion where -- where the prosecution

10

argues that the defendant will pose a threat to -- to

11

society in the future.

12

That -- that opinion -- and just a few lines

13

earlier it also said, again -- and I'm going to quote the

14

words -- if the prosecution does not argue future

15

dangerousness, the State may appropriately decide that

parole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration

even if the only sentencing alternative to death is life

in prison without the possibility of parole.

He says this is an

But -- but again, Justice Ginsburg,

11

that goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up

12

his crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to

13

reform his life, he's gone further and that makes this

14

crime worse and -- and more worthy of harsher treatment

15

from a punishing standpoint.

16

MS. ZAPP:

It is our position that in 1998 when

17

the State courts ruled, it was entirely reasonable for the

18

Supreme Court to view Simmons as requiring that issues of

19

future dangerousness be generated by the prosecution's

argument.

the other issue in this case, but let me ask you.

You've,

23

I assume, read these cases.

24

this instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say,

25

well, sure, there's life without parole, but that can

In -- in other States where

change?

2

from now, 5.

3

along those lines?

4

in giving this instruction to the jury?

5

We don't know what the law will be like 3 years
Have there been any problems along that -足

MS. ZAPP:

Have there been any problems generally

Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure of the

6

practice in other States, but I can tell you that in

7

Pennsylvania -- and this is a point I need to correct from

8

my opponent's argument.

9

parole eligibility is not a simple no.

The answer to the question about
And that -- our

10

supreme court has said that.

11

prohibition in granting the -- granting parole to someone

12

who's sentenced to life, but we also have a constitutional

13

provision that allows the sentence to be commuted to,

14

among other things, parole or other forms of early

15

release.

16

to be entirely accurate for sentencing jury, you've got to

17

communicate both of those conducts.

18

We have a statutory

Our State supreme court has said you -- in order

And -- and the second part that has over the

19

years -- and this goes to respond to your question -- has

20

caused our court some pause in why we retain the rule.

21

And that is they are very concerned.

22

expressed the view that by letting the jury know that the

23

operation of the constitutional provision which can

24

theoretically -- and, in fact, in the past often has

25

resulted in a life sentence being commuted -- it may be

skewing the jury's perception of the punishments adversely

2

to a defendant.

3

made a decision not to introduce sentencing information

4

into -- early release information into the sentencing

5

process in Pennsylvania, the concern that if a jury hears

6

that there's some theoretical possibility or learns that

7

it has been -- been actual -- there's been actual early

8

release in the past, that it may -- may, out of an

9

exercise of caution, automatically choose a death

11

13

It's one of the reasons why they have

sentence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that explains why your

State is the only holdout.
MS. ZAPP:

Well, I'm sorry.

Well, that it's -足

14

they -- they have serious concerns, Your Honor, that -足

15

that this is something that is necessary to the integrity

16

of the process.

17

And there are two other concerns they've also

18

mentioned too.

19

the jury be deflected from the specific process that we

20

have under law which -- which is -- which is specified in

21

our law for -- for imposing a sentence and not be

22

distracted by undue speculation about whether or not the

23

defendant is ever going to be released from prison.

24

And the second -- or excuse me.

25

They're -- they're concerns that -- that

The third point

that they're worried about is that a sentencing jury who,

Page 36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

for whatever reason, becomes reluctant to -- to carry out

2

its duties may see this as an opportunity to shift the

3

sentencing burden to somebody like a parole board or -- or

4

other sentencing authority.

5

-- they've enforced this rule because they just see it as

6

underscoring the integrity of the process.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so that's why they have

May I ask you a question about

8

the competence of counsel issue?

9

sympathetic to the problems of busy lawyers who have so

10

much to do and they're preparing for a penalty hearing.

11

But one -- one aspect of this case -- I hope you'll

12

comment -- and that is, the fact that the prosecutor had

13

told the defense they were going to use certain

14

aggravating circumstances, and the files in those -足

15

relating to those circumstances were available in the

16

courthouse.

17

I'm wrong -- counsel did not examine those files, and had

18

he examined those files, he would have opened the door to

19

a wealth of information.

20

mistake by the lawyer?

21

One -- I'm -- I'm very

And as I understand -- and you correct me if

MS. ZAPP:

Isn't that a fairly serious

Not in this circumstance, Justice

22

Stevens, and -- and for this reason.

The information that

23

is typically contained in those files -- and -- and again,

24

I -- I want to add some additional information for the -足

25

for the Court on this point.

As Mr. Nolas says,

Page 37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Pennsylvania law does require preparation of records,

2

including certain types of information.

3

often the case, the -- the -- in -- in practical -- and

4

the practical realities are not necessarily all records

5

are equal.

6

attorneys cannot necessarily -- or would not automatically

7

have reason to think these may give them a wealth of

8

information.

9

But as -- as is

So as a matter of practice, in Pennsylvania

But in this situation we had counsel seeking to

10

obtain that very same information, in fact, had previously

11

discussed that sort of thing with the family members.

12

so they at that point would have reasonably expected that

13

they had a fair picture of the defendant's formative

14

years -足

15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:
that's all true.

And

Well, maybe they -- assume

They thought they knew everything -足

17

MS. ZAPP:

Right.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- they needed to know.

But

19

still, if you say to me I'm going to put on certain

20

exhibits, A, B, and C, and the defense says I'm not even

21

going to even take a look at them before you put them on,

22

I find that quite unusual.

23

MS. ZAPP:

Well, they knew from interviewing

24

their client what his criminal history was, and at that -足

25

this point, they had every reason to believe they

Page 38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

possessed a fair and accurate assessment of his

2

background, and the decision not to -- to go -- to -- to

3

take a look at this was -- was reasonable under the

4

circumstances.

5

information and no reason to expect there was anything

6

else in there based on their discussions with their own

7

client.

8

Counsel thought they already had that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They thought they had -- it

9

was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that

10

this man might not even be competent at the moment to

11

stand trial, that he -- that they might have a -- a basis

12

for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to

13

rely just on what he told them without looking at the

14

record that was in the prosecutor's hands?

15

MS. ZAPP:

Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg.

And again,

16

we're talking about the sequence of events here.

17

this -- this came up relatively later on in the

18

proceedings after counsel had already expended much of

19

their time gathering information in the -- the information

20

about what was going to be introduced.

21

in -- in terms of the time line of this case, relatively

22

late, after counsel has already talked to experts and

23

obtained information, talked to family members and -足

24

on this very point.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. ZAPP:

Comparatively late over the course of

14

this case.

15

respect that would have led them to conclude that there

16

would be no profit in -- in searching out additional

17

records.

18

The counsel had already done things in that

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is this, that I

20

horrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the

true, isn't it?

24

that right?

25

And the prosecution was making an enormous

Am I right about the case?

This is the record that did exist.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

This is -- I'm thinking

2

of it correctly, that this is the record in the case that

3

the prosecution made a lot out of.

4

MS. ZAPP:

I believe -足

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm -- I'm back with Justice

6

Stevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer

7

wouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to

8

see if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation

9

accurately.

And had he done so, he would have seen on the

10

next page, alcohol problems.

11

complete list of siblings, and he would have seen, four

12

pages later, a one-page list of criminal behavior with

13

identification of crimes that took place when he was a

14

child.

15

He would have seen a

That's all true.
Now, if he had then noticed these early criminal

16

records when he was a 17-year-old and simply gotten the

17

record in that one, he would have come across the document

18

that is on page L44 and L45 which says, among other

19

things, Ronald comes from the notorious Rompilla family.

20

And then there is a list of why they are called the

21

notorious Rompilla family which is fairly horrendous.

22

Now, I do not understand how any person, getting

23

the first record, wouldn't have been led to the second,

24

and I do not understand how any person who read pages 44

25

and 45 of the second would not have thought what the

2

few more siblings who happen to have their names and

3

addresses here right in the pieces of paper he's looking

4

at.

5

horrendous background that Judge Sloviter mentions.

6

do not understand why that one incident, leaving aside all

7

the other ones, but I do not understand why that one

8

failure to consult the record that is being used by the

9

prosecutor horrendously against him is not a failure.

10

I better go check on a

And he would then have discovered this absolutely

MS. ZAPP:

So I

Well, Your -- Your Honor, in response

11

to that, I would say this.

12

of counsel in the State post-conviction proceedings that

13

they had interviewed their client in great detail about

14

his prior conviction, that they were aware of what had -足

15

what it had involved.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's clear from the testimony

if you -足
MS. ZAPP:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, my question, obviously,

12

is, is not the reason that you want to examine the

13

criminal record in the case that is being used

14

horrendously against your client is to find out both as to

15

what happened at the time and also the background that

16

would be relevant in respect to your client?

17

alcohol abuse, which happened to be checked.

18

MS. ZAPP:

For example,

But -- but, Justice Breyer, yes,

19

certainly looking at a record would serve those purposes.

20

But again, the information in those records was available

21

from other sources.

22

and the question that we have to look at here was did

23

counsel set out on a plan to try to get the same

information, which clearly they did, and they -- they

sought to get it from people who ostensibly knew that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACI L. LOVITT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MS. LOVITT:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:

10

Petitioner's ineffectiveness argument seems to

11

be hinging on four things which are the court records in

12

the aggravation case, the charge to the expert, the family

13

members' level of cooperation, and the petitioner's level

14

of cooperation.

15

demonstrates that counsel was reasonable with respect to

16

all.

17

that appears to be what's concerning the Court.

18

But a fair reading of the record

But I want to start with the court records because

I think there's a misperception here that

19

counsel did nothing to prepare for the aggravation case.

20

The record, fairly read, reflects that they received

21

through the discovery process the rap sheet and everything

22

they needed to know in order to challenge the -- the

23

aggravation case, and that's at JA664 and 667, is Attorney

24

Charles testifying that he received the rap sheet through

25

discovery and that the prosecutor, in order to try and

Page 44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

induce a plea, was very, very clear about what he intended

2

to do in aggravation and what the aggravation case would

3

be.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But a rap sheet and so forth

5

will not have normally what this person is like.

6

dealing with a client who has serious problems of some

7

kind as the crimes themselves reveal.

8

MS. LOVITT:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're

They're terrible.

I -- I think -足
And -- and so I -- don't you

10

think it's a reasonable -- or do you think it's a

11

reasonable constitutional requirement to say that where

12

cases of prior history of the client are being used by the

13

prosecution to say what a terrible person he is -- and he

14

may be -- that you -- the -- the lawyer in a capital case

15

at least should look at the court records in that case to

16

learn something about what this human being is like and

17

why?

18

that kind of thing.

19

Because court records, but not rap sheets do contain

MS. LOVITT:

I think there are two answers to

20

that question.

21

looking at the testimony that would be read at -- during

22

the aggravation and sentencing case to determine how to

23

challenge that, how best to challenge that.

24
25

First is that counsel was, in fact,

And second, the assumption of the question is
that the court records were somehow superior to the

Page 45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

sources that counsel actually looked to.

2

think on the record of this case, that's objectively true.

3

Counsel is -- has -- has hired three independent experts,

4

all of whom are specifically trained -足

5

you brought this up because I'd like to point the Court to

10

JA1069 and 1079 which is where Dr. Cooke testifies, as

Dr. Sadoff is at 1105 and 1122.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought it was not

Page 46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

contested that in fact the primary reason why these

2

doctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted

3

to see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity.

4

wanted to see if there was a basis to claim that his

5

client was incompetent to stand trial.

6

MS. LOVITT:

He

That is -- that is definitely

7

contested with respect to Drs. Cooke and Sadoff.

With

8

respect to Dr. Gross, who was the first expert that was

9

hired, he testified that his marching orders were fairly

10

limited, and I think that's where this idea is coming

11

across that all the experts were only charged to look for

12

competency to stand trial.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And Dr. Gross is the one who -足

14

who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I

15

think.

16

MS. LOVITT:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And one way, at least a kind of

18

a threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have

19

been to look at the -- the personal history report in the

20

file of the prior case.

21

have found something on that subject.

If they had done so, they would

22

So even -- even if we forget the question of the

23

-- the scope of the expert's original brief and we look to

24

Dr. Gross' suggestion and we look to the failure to look

25

in an obvious place, i.e., the -- the personal history

report and -- and the case file, which the State said it

2

was going to use, don't we have a problem with competence

3

of counsel?

4

MS. LOVITT:

No, because counsel looked -足

5

followed up in an objectively reasonable place.

6

testimony was that they hired two more experts to look at

7

this issue, and Dr. Gross did not conclude -足

there's something out there about violent chemical

helpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, the serious question to

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

me is -- is -- in many of these cases which we see, there

are horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a

3

terribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that

4

might not convince most juries of anything because they're

all over the place.

MS. LOVITT:

Well, the testimony is clear.

14

Counsel knew about the abuse denial dynamic and they did

15

follow up on it by hiring three experts who were charged

16

to ferret this out.

17

to say, notwithstanding the fact that you did that, you

18

still have to go to records because as Strickland

19

recognizes, counsel, even where you have diligent, devoted

20

counsel, as here, have to make decisions about resource

21

and time allocation.

22

And it would do constitutional harm

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Strickland was about a

23

strategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather

24

than another.

in Pennsylvania was not to get records, that it was, as

suggests, to first sit down with your client, have an

extensive conversation with your client, get a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. NOLAS:

Yes, Your Honors.

Thank you very

much.
Justice Kennedy, you asked a question about

serendipity.

That's why you conduct an investigation.

19

That's why you look into records.

20

has said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough,

diligent investigation.

that my client is the worst person on the face of the

earth or, as in this case, that it's going to provide

25

evidence leading to mental retardation, significant mental

that investigation because the prior conviction court file

3

may contain information that reduces the weight of the

4

aggravating factor.

5

You do

In this case, had counsel gotten that court

6

file, as Justice Breyer summarized, they would have had

7

evidence that not only would have reduced the weight of

8

that prior aggravating factor that -- but that would have

9

provided something mitigating for this jury.

Indeed, Ms.

10

Zapp quotes at page 41 the 1980 ABA standards that very

11

clearly say, please, for mercy, do not substitute for an

12

actual thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and

13

presentation of mitigating evidence.

14

lawyers ended up with was an unconnected plea for mercy

15

because they didn't take the steps that reasonable counsel

16

take in a capital case.

17

And all these

I also urge this Court not to be misled by -- by

18

some commentary today about the testimony of the lawyers.

19

At page 506, Ms. Dantos very clearly says that she's read

20

the transcript of the penalty phase when that prior

21

conviction court file is brought in by the trial

22

prosecutor.

23

counsel, says, I object.

24

And the trial prosecutor says, you could have walked down

25

the hall and gotten it just like I did.

And at that point, Mr. Charles, her co足
I've never seen that before.

That's -- that's

what's she referring to at page 506.
As far as the doctors are concerned, I'll just

read to Your Honors just from Ms. Dantos herself.

She has

read at pages 473 and 474 what Dr. Gross had said.

Yes, that's what it was as to Dr. Gross.

Yes, the same evaluation.

is that also what Dr. Sadoff did?

Yes.

what she asked the doctors to do.

made is that the last two went beyond that.

disagree with that?

MR. NOLAS:

Do you

I disagree with that, Your Honor,

23

and you should look at those pages from Ms. Dantos and

24

then look at the pages from Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff.

25

This is Dr. Sadoff at page 1105.

I would have examined him for possibility of mitigating

There is a universal difference between that

type of mental health examination and a life history

your life that the jury should consider as mitigating.

Was there neglect?

Was there
