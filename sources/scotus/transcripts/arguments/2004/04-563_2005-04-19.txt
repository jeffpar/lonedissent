ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

We'll hear argument

MR. CHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1996, Congress made an important change to

11

the habeas corpus proceedings by enacting a one-year

12

statute-of-limitations period.

13

consider, for the first time, how the relation back

14

doctrine under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) is

15

to be applied in the habeas context.

16

This Court is now asked to

The Warden advocates a rule for relation back is

17

that the conduct transaction occurrence set forth in the

18

initial petition is the core of operative facts to support

19

the constitutional violations alleged.

20

superior to the Ninth Circuit's rule, which a majority of

21

Circuits have determined effectively nullifies AEDPA's

22

one-year statute of limitations.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This rule is far

Well, of course, I take it the

24

issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted

25

under 15(a).

1

MR. CHAN:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And if there's been lack of

3

diligence, et cetera, and -- or some prejudice to the

4

State in the delay of the amendment, the Court just won't

5

accept the amendment.

6

MR. CHAN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. CHAN:

9

I should clarify that Or am I wrong about that?

-- that in Civil Rule 15(a), the

Court has discretion and grants -- needs to grant leave to

10

amend after a responsive pleading has been filed.

11

However, a Petitioner gets to file a responsive pleading

12

-- excuse me, an amended petition, as a matter of right,

13

before a responsive pleading is filed.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

Well, it was filed before a

responsive pleading -

16

MR. CHAN:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

MR. CHAN: -- it was Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this case -- was filed -

-- in this case.
How long does it usually take

21

to file a responsive pleading?

22

MR. CHAN:

23
24
25

with -- case to case.

It depends, Your Honor.

It varies

In a lot of pro se -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But the State has a certain

amount of flexibility in deciding when to respond, does it

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not?

2

MR. CHAN:

Well, Your Honor, the rule does not

3

require the State to respond to petitions until ordered by

4

the District Court.

5

Rule 15(a), even after a responsive pleading has been

6

filed, Rule 15(a) does not serve the same purposes as Rule

7

15(c).

8

which is meant to apply whether the filing is a day late

9

or a year late, whether there is prejudice, or whether

And to get back to the question of

The statute of limitations is strict defense,

10

there is dilatory motive.

11

of the statute of limitations, Rule 15(c)(2) provides an

12

exception to the statute of limitations, but that

13

exception is limited to the parameters of Rule 15(c)(2),

14

itself.

15

claim, it determines whether or not that claim is time-

16

barred, pursuant to 15(c)(2).

17

To ameliorate the harsh effects

So when the Court is provided with a untimely

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, just before we leave

18

15(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in

19

this case and there's potential for a gaping hole in

20

AEDPA.

21

by filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the

22

amendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the

23

Court to file a response?

Does the State have some ability to protect itself

24

MR. CHAN:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

For pro- Do you see what I'm -

after everything had been done.

And that occurs after the Court has made a

It can happen that a Petitioner will be able

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- you have -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, please, go ahead.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I was going to say, if -- on

13

the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even

14

know that the petition has been filed, because the -- you

15

don't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole

16

rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I

17

understand it, because you point out that the rationale

18

for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you

19

on notice as to the case that you have to meet.

20

shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to

21

meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever

22

preliminary steps you've taken.

23

you're talking about, you have not been put on notice,

24

because you don't even know there is a petition there yet.

25

You have not been led to prepare a case which has now

And you

But in the scenario that

changed.

2

apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice,

3

and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.

So it seems to me that your rationale does not

4

MR. CHAN:

But even in that scenario, we are

5

still prejudiced by the fact that now we have to address

6

additional claims that would otherwise be time-barred.

7

do not get a chance to -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We

No, but that -- the problem

with that is that a -- the whole point of a relation-back

10

rule is to get around a time bar.

11

them.

12

shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because

13

we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our

14

case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely

15

new case."

16

preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule,

17

the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar.

18

If you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an

19

argument.

20

That's why you have

And I thought your argument was, "Well, you

And so, that's why, it seems to me, your

MR. CHAN:

Well, I was addressing the situation

21

in which we -- in which we can answer first.

22

that I responded, in the reply brief, that that would be

23

an onerous burden on the State.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, it would be.

And I think

But, again,

in the case that you're talking about, the very value that

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you're arguing for -- i.e., "We ought to be able to rely

2

on the notice that we have given" -- is an argument which

3

hasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to

4

make.

5

MR. CHAN:

Well, that situation would occur not

6

as frequently as the situation in which we face an

7

amendment after we have notice, Your Honor.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Chan, there is really no

way for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even by

10

filing an answer immediately.

11

against the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it

12

wouldn't protect it against the District Judge's ability

13

to grant an amendment after the response.

14

MR. CHAN:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would protect it

That's right, Your Honor.
There's no way to get any

16

protection against that, no matter how promptly you

17

respond.

18

MR. CHAN:

That's absolutely correct.

And

19

Congress could not have intended its statute-of

20

limitations rule to be -- to have its effectiveness

21

dependent upon the Court exercise of discretion under Rule

22

15(a).

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. CHAN: Which has liberally granted amendments.

The discretion -

Why -

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The discretion under 15(a),

2

at least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is

3

to be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are

4

so -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test

5

is quite different from the general attitude to pleading

6

amendments, "Well, we'll let the Plaintiff," or, here, the

7

Petitioner, "make the pleading alteration, and then it

8

will be there, and the Court will make a determination of

9

whether the pleading is good or not."

But, at the 15(a)

10

threshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening

11

device, is it?

12

MR. CHAN:

No, Your Honor.

The better screening

13

device is in Rule 15(c)(2).

14

is the provision that determines whether or not a claim is

15

time-barred.

16

not the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred.

17

As mentioned, Rule 15(c)(2)

And 15(a), then, can determine whether or

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Chan, do you think

18

the Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas

19

cases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other

20

civil litigation?

21

MR. CHAN:

If the Court is referring to Rule

22

15(c)(2), our argument is that Rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule

23

of automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil

24

cases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of

25

automatic relation back in habeas cases.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But what if we were to

2

determine that in regular civil litigation it is

3

relatively automatic?

4

respect to habeas cases after AEDPA?

5

MR. CHAN:

What would your position be with

Well, my argument would be that the

6

habeas Rule 11 provides that, to the -- to the extent that

7

the civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal

8

habeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied.

9

I think that Rule 11 compels a reading that if you have

And

10

one application that is inconsistent with AEDPA's provisions

11

and the framework of habeas corpus, and another

12

interpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go

13

with the interpretation that is consistent with AEDPA.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you have more than Rule 11;

15

you have Section 2244, which says that an application for

16

habeas corpus, quote, "may be amended as provided in the

17

rules of procedure applicable to civil actions."

18

MR. CHAN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that So, I don't think it's even a

20

close question whether the rules of procedure for

21

amendment in civil actions apply.

22

MR. CHAN:

There's no question that -- we are

23

not questioning that Rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas

24

corpus, but Section 2242 does not give any guidance as to

25

how 15(c)(2) should be interpreted.

And I believe that

asked to relate back.

7

8

would be an issue, because it takes time to process these,

9

and they had to get counsel appointed.

I'm sure you've had a

This particular claim was

It would seem to me that that would

And counsel comes

10

in and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in

11

a pro se petition.

assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking

13

about a delay of only a few months?

14
15
16

Is it -- would I be correct in

MR. CHAN:

For pro se petitions who have been

assigned counsel, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, no, normally -- the

17

issue of whether or not there should be -- the petition

18

may have the benefit of the relation back normally is -

19

involves a delay of not more than, say, five or six

20

months, in a normal case.

21

MR. CHAN:

23

that would -

wondering about how serious a problem it is.
MR. CHAN:

It can be a more serious problem in

3

capital litigation, where you're dealing with many more

4

claims, which could be more complex, which could require

5

exhaustion for the -- before the federal review.

6

depends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the

issues involved.

for how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the

11

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in the capital case, you've

13

got a specific provision in there.

14

capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about

15

most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress

16

provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they

17

opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.

18

MR. CHAN:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, for the

That's true, Your Honor.
And so, why -- I mean, isn't

20

the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer

21

that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt

22

in, then the normal amendment rules apply?

23

MR. CHAN:

The Chapter 154 provisions do set

24

forth a fast track for capital cases if the State can

25

establish certain appointment procedures for counsel.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

However, it did not speak to the interpretation of Rule

2

15(c)(2), and Congress could not have intended that the

3

statute of limitations not apply to Chapter 153 simply

4

because of Chapter 154.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is your definition of

6

the test under 15(c)(2)?

7

argument is -- Felix's argument is, it's the entire trial

8

episode, right?

9

MR. CHAN:

10

I mean, on the one side, the

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And is yours that every

11

single objection that might be made in this entire trial

12

record, every one, is a separate transaction or

13

occurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?

14

MR. CHAN:

For purpose of 15(c)(2), our

15

interpretation is that the kind of transaction occurrence

16

is that core of operative facts that support the

17

constitutional claims.

18

it is not necessarily true that one objection claim would

19

not relate back to a second objection claim.

20

depends upon whether they're closely related.

21

That means that the objections -

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

takes an entirely different set of facts to establish that

new claim.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The successive petition rules,

4

or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to

treat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as

one case.

7

intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you

8

want to under Rule 15(c).

9

And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat

MR. CHAN:

I think that the Respondent made a

10

similar argument, based on a res judicata claim, and it

11

was noted in the treatises that were cited that you have

12

different intents behind res judicata and the relation-

13

back doctrine, and they just do not apply that way.

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

21
22

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The relevant conduct, transaction or occurrence

23

in the habeas context is the set of facts that are

24

asserted in support of the particular grounds for relief

25

under habeas Rule 2.

That reference point best preserves

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress' intent under AEDPA to accelerate the filing and

2

disposition of habeas proceedings.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking

4

the position that that is a tighter test than would apply

5

ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?

6

MS. BLATT:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, our

7

fundamental point is, there is no counterpart to tort or

8

contract action, with habeas.

9

And that is because there's not only Rule 2, which imposes

There is just no analog.

10

this heightened across-the-board fact pleading

11

requirement, but it's also because those pleading rules

12

work in tandem with all the other unique habeas rules that

13

apply only to habeas that serve to narrow the timing and

14

scope of habeas review.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a -- it's a little odd

16

for the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we

17

look to the rules, but we interpret it differently.

18

certainly see the common sense of your position, but I'm

19

just having a problem with 15(c)(2).

20

MS. BLATT:

I

Yes, I just don't think it's

21

different, both -- regardless, you've got to come the case

22

and figure out what is the relevant-conduct transaction or

23

occurrence in a habeas petition.

24

view of viewing it as the entire trial or conviction, or

25

there's another view as -- look at it as what the habeas

And there's the extreme

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

rules require, and that is the prisoner to identify a

2

particular unconstitutional conduct or occurrence that

3

gives rise to a basis for relief.

4

Now, under the Ninth Circuit's view, a prisoner

5

can timely file one claim and then add any number of

6

completely different claims after the one-year period.

7

For instance, a timely Batson challenge could then -

8

after the one year, the claim could add claims of

9

ineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, or

10

coerced confession.

11

would significantly extend the limitations period beyond

12

the one-year period.

13

And to have to resolve those claims

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

14

extreme as that, is it?

15

admitted at trial.

16

MS. BLATT:

Well, this case isn't as

It has to do with evidence

It's -- well, that's true, it takes

17

in trial errors, but that's a lot.

18

of counsel is a trial error.

19

confrontation clause, discriminatory selection in the jury

20

-- I mean, I don't know if that's a trial, or maybe

21

pretrial -- but it does take in a lot, and I don't think

22

there's a close call that they relate to different actors,

23

different time periods -

24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Ineffective assistance

Coerced confession,

Well, certainly in the civil-

case context, generally, the interpretation has been

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

pretty broad.

2

we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.

3

And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot,

MS. BLATT:

I'm not sure about that.

This has

4

been the rule in the majority of Circuits for five or six

5

years now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a

6

lot of problems.

And that's because, Justice O'Connor --

that you want?

Can you articulate the rule

are asserted in support of the grounds for relief in the

way the Courts of Appeals haven't really had to identify a

test -- is because they're so disparate in time and type.

You have an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that's

is not a train accident.

And there is -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's hard for me to

7

figure it out, too, but it seems to me that what you're

8

saying is that we have a different rule, because this is

habeas.

MS. BLATT:

In the civil context, you always

have a question of, Do we let in other loan transactions

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm sure it would be

acceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the

rule two different ways, depending on the case?

MS. BLATT:

Well, it's not like there's a habeas

civil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas -- habeas

12

proceeding to be different.

requirement that the prisoner actually identify all the

grounds and the particular facts in support of that, and

those heightened pleading requirements focus the

proceeding on that particular transaction.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is no counterpart to a

But, Justice Souter -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but if that's -- if

10

that's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me

11

that, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend.

12

Because I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are

13

going to be much close than -- in the real world, than the

14

-- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not

15

close enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment

16

rule.

17

MS. BLATT:

There's amendment all the time in

18

the majority of Circuits that have applied the

19

Government's test, and it comes up in two scenarios -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MS. BLATT:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MS. BLATT:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

MS. BLATT:

Not if you were the judge.

No, that's not true, Justice Souter.
No, but, I mean, why -

Because -- why -

Let me just say, on the attorney

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point

2

what the Government's view is, because the claims are

3

completely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit

4

whether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to

5

show procedural default, he's going to have to show

6

attorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything

7

additional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't

8

matter which claim he asserts first.

9

But the reason why amendment occurs all the time

10

is because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts

11

such that if he raises a Miranda claim or a Strickland

12

claim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege

13

prejudice under Strickland, he can amend, after the one-

14

year period.

15

And also -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you can amend -- you can

16

amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend

17

your claims.

18

MS. BLATT:

No, the way you get claims, which is

19

really the -- the direct text on the rule says you can add

20

a claim if it arises out of the same -- is if the

21

transaction relates to the -- to give you an example, to

22

an involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of

23

a Miranda claim that arises out of that police -- alleged

24

police misconduct that culminated in the admission of the

25

confession.

You could also have a Massiah violation that

related back to a Fifth Amendment claim.

2

have other types, too.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you could

It seems to me that the reason

4

for the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule

5

does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't

6

want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I

7

understand, is really based entirely on the interest in

8

finality and repose.

9

MS. BLATT:

Well, I think the interest of notice

10

is part of it.

11

State hasn't -- or the Federal Government hasn't answered.

12

But statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in

13

terms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose

14

--

I mean, it doesn't always trigger when the

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MS. BLATT:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but the definition -

-- and closure.
-- in the rule is really to

18

protect the interest in fairness, because interest in

19

repose is always the same.

20

MS. BLATT:

Well, that -- it's to preserve the

21

statute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is

22

something narrower than the conviction, then the interest

23

of repose sets in.

24

know, the same point -- it's if you draw it out broad

25

enough -

And, I mean, the other side has, you

Congress' intent in passing the one year.

fundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner

unlimited number of claims, no matter how different and -

big deal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. PORTER

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. PORTER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

I'd like to respond to the finality concern,

12

because I think that really goes to the heart of this

13

case.

14

Three weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versus

15

Weber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyance

16

procedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtaining

17

review of his federal claims outweighed the competing

18

interests of finality and speedy resolution of the federal

19

petition.

20

Now, Mr. Felix's case is even more compelling

21

than Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyance

22

procedure, which is just the power -- the inherent power

23

of the Court to control its docket, here we're talking

24

about the command of Congress.

25

In Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

provided, specifically, that the rules governing

2

amendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules

3

governing civil procedure.

4

The only rule regarding -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, that's true.

I mean,

5

we can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's

6

a transaction or occurrence, I assume.

7

us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?

8
9

MR. PORTER:

And is it open to

Your Honor, I believe that under

this Court's decisions about how you determine what

10

Congress did, Congress operated against a backdrop of how

11

Rule 15(c) was applied by this Court and the lower courts.

12

And in 1948, when 2242 was adopted, Tiller was very

13

recent; it was a 1945 case.

14

assume that Congress, like normal citizens, know what the

15

law is, and they developed the rule against that backdrop.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It must have been -- and we

Well, that was -- that was a

17

rule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases.

18

And, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are

19

fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give

20

to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases,

21

is very vague.

22

"I got hit by a train."

23

the train was negligent -- or the railroad was negligent,"

24

or anything else; just, "I got hit by a train."

25

with respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that

It's just, you know, what the event was,
You don't have to say, "Wherein,

Whereas,

require specifying all the grounds for relief available to

2

the Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground.

3

It seems to me that those different pleading requirements

4

suggest that what is the relevant transaction or

5

occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the

6

relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.

7

MR. PORTER:

That's a very good point I'd like

8

to address, because I don't think we hit that -- upon that

9

in our briefs.

10

Habeas 2 -- habeas Rule 2 does require fact

11

pleading, but the purpose of that is not to give notice to

12

the other party, as the Solicitor General and the Warden

13

suggest.

14

habeas cases, so they don't even get a copy of the

15

petition; it is filed with the court.

16

The petition is not served on the Warden in

The purpose of the fact-pleading requirement of

17

Rule 2 is so that the District Court, under Rule 4 of

18

habeas rules, can perform its screening function to

19

determine whether the petition is facially valid or not.

20

That requires some sort of facts to be plead.

21

in the Advisory Committee notes.

22

requirement of 2243 of the Judicial Code, that the

23

District Court review the petition so that wardens are not

24

disturbed with every pro se litigant's Petitioner and have

25

to respond.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Whatever the reason

2

for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say

3

that the pleading requirement being different and much

4

more specific, the amendment process should be different.

5

MR. PORTER:

I think that that's -- Congress

6

reasonably could have said that, and reasonably could have

7

said that -- amended 2242, for example, when it passed the

8

Antiterrorism Act, and said, "Generally, yes, the rules of

9

civil procedure apply for amendments," but we're -- there

10
11

should be a narrower rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But you don't need an

12

amendment, I don't think.

13

transaction, the question is, What is the transaction?

14

And in habeas it may be quite different than in other

15

civil things.

16

MR. PORTER:

If you're talking about a

I think that the only basis for

17

determining what "transaction" is, you have to look at the

18

-- if you -- if you're right, that we should have some

19

kind of different rule for habeas than all other civil

20

proceedings, well, then it has to be grounded in the

21

habeas statutes.

22

statutes, it says, "Confinement must be in violation of

23

the constitutional" -

And if -- when you look at the habeas

I mean, what's bothering me

2

about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs

3

to argue that there is a different rule.

4

lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words

5

"core operative fact."

6

case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of

7

Train B, is that collision.

9

the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the

As I read the

Core operative facts in a tort

And the decision that the

10

same operative fact.

11

that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated

12

unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a

13

different set of core operative facts from the fact that

14

the Defendant was questioned before the trial.

15

Core operative facts.

But to say

Now, that seems to me related to the nature of

16

habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, "core

17

operative fact," the same words, work differently in the

18

two situations.

19

me as running around the one-year statute of limitations.

20

And to adopt your approach also strikes

Now, those are my concerns, and I would

21

appreciate your addressing them.

22

MR. PORTER:

23
24
25

Well, I hope I can put those to

rest.
On the first concern, I think that there are
differences between a train wreck and habeas.

Most of my

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

habeas cases are train wrecks, so I hope that's not -- but

2

I think there is a logical difference between them.

3

think when you look carefully at the case of Tiller, those

4

really were very different facts about the head car not

5

being lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit.

6

After all, those were two separate legal claims, as well.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. PORTER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I

But, Mr. Porter -

The first one -- all that would be required

10

to allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the

11

Plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, "The

12

train was negligently operated," with nothing more

13

specific than that.

to allege, going in.

18

And then the particulars could come

Under habeas, you can't do that.

You must set

So, it's a very different approach to what you have

MR. PORTER:

I agree, Your Honor, but you -- I

19

think you need to step back and look at the purpose for

20

the difference in the pleading rules.

21

the -- if the reason was that you have to give specific

22

facts to put the other side on notice, I would say that

23

there is a compelling argument that that should be -- that

24

should inform this Court's decision about how Rule 15(c)

25

should be read.

The purpose is, if

But it's very clear, from 2243 and from

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

habeas Rule 4, that the purpose for requiring the facts

2

underlying the claims is not to give notice to the other

3

side, but to allow the District Court to perform its

screening function to determine whether the -- whether the

5

petition is facially valid or not.

then the Warden is not even served with the petition.

just -- the petition is simply dismissed.

Can you file -- can you file a

request for a more specific statement in habeas, as you
can in a civil case?
MR. PORTER:

Yes, under Rule 81 of the Federal

12

Rules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 11, unless application

13

of that rule is contrary to, or inconsistent with, the

14

habeas statutes or rules, then it is applied.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could we go back?

Because I'm

16

still concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a

17

claim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and

18

didn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a

19

claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor,

20

during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments.

21

think, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same

22

core operative facts?

23

totally different.

24

together is that there was a single legal proceeding.

25

Absolutely not.

Now, I

The facts are

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm

2

running around Congress' effort with the one-year statute.

3

So what is your response?

4

MR. PORTER:

First of all, the response is that

5

the statute -- the rule does not use the term "core

6

operative facts."

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but every lower court that

8

has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it

9

seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts

10

have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller.

11

Is that true, or not true?

12
13

MR. PORTER:

Not in the habeas context.

None of

those -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, of course not in the habeas

15

context.

16

habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the

17

civil law, wouldn't we use the word "core operative fact"?

18

Or would we?

19

is the answer?

20
21

I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the

I'm not as familiar with this as you.

MR. PORTER:

I don't believe so.

What

I think that

--

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. PORTER:

No?

-- and Wright and Miller confirmed

24

this, that actually courts have tried to develop different

25

tests: Is it the same evidence that they're going to use?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Is it a core of operative facts?

say there's no better test than the one set forth in the

rule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, in the end, they

But, of course, we're trying to

decide what is the transaction.

there is a body of case law that determines -- that's told

us what that means.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MR. PORTER:

Let's -

And Tiller tells us it means that

it's the events leading up to the injury.

that's what Congress adopted -

at all the cases that have followed Tiller, and -- but

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But in the habeas context,

haven't the majority of the Circuits had a more

restrictive rule than the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth

7

have espoused?

MR. PORTER:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, they have.
Yes.

And so, I think the

10

question is, Should we follow the majority of the

11

Circuits?

12

MR. PORTER:

And you should not, because what

13

those courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate

14

that Congress has already spoken, in two different ways.

15

First, Congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted AEDPA,

16

it did not amend 2242, and it did not amend Rule 15(c).

17

And, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is

18

really the only set of cases where there is an incentive

19

to delay, Congress specifically spoke.

20

2266(b)(3)(B) Congress said, "Amendments to petitions

21

shall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the

22

Petitioner can make a showing for a second or successive

23

petition."

And in

Now, this is Lindh versus Murphy all over again.
This is a case where Congress has spoken as to Chapter

logically, Congress determined, "We should have a very,

very strict restriction of amendments."

In Lindh versus Murphy, it said, "That chapter will

Miranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the time

of trial.

15

MR. PORTER:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's correct.
That's the point.

You don't

17

look two and a half years back just to -- you decide what

18

happened at the trial.

MR. PORTER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
Right.

And in this -

So what about the

injury?

part of the same transaction.

that's a real viable alternative.

That is not, I suggest,

So, I don't think that

I -- again, I think it's important for the Court

8

to go back -- if it's going to create a different rule in

habeas, it has to have some grounding -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why doesn't the 1981 -

11

given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly,

12

but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back?

think the injury that took place from both violations took

Well, let -- if we can

21

return to the facts of this case, I think these -- we fit

comfortably within the definition of "transaction,"

Those statements, independently, when they were taken by

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Porter, if I understand

2

you right, you are saying that, in the habeas context, the

3

counterpart to an injury in a tort case is the unlawful

4

detention, itself.

Am -

MR. PORTER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. PORTER:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

That's correct.
-- I right?

Yes.
Okay.

So if that's the

injury, could the habeas Petitioner come in with a

10

complaint that says, "I am being detained in violation of

11

the Constitution," period, "and I need a lawyer to spell

12

out the details"?

13

MR. PORTER:

The Petitioner could file such a

14

petition.

15

But, clearly, under Rule 4 of the habeas rules, such a

16

petition would be subject to immediate dismissal by the

17

District Court, because it doesn't conform with habeas

18

Rule 2, which requires that all of the claims be alleged

19

and all of the facts be alleged.

20

They have been called "placeholder petitions."

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the other part of

what's been bothering me?

2

And that's quite protective.

3

But suppose you said that to Congress.

They

4

passed this thing.

5

here, it doesn't really mean a year.

6

this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is,

7

they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the

8

interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost

9

always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that

And you say, "You know, your year
It means a year for

11

what would that Congress have said?

very much disturbing me.

MR. PORTER:

That's -- that is

I think the answer to that is that

proceedings.

16

relation back.

17

1948, just three years after the Tiller case, when it

18

enacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back

19

goes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation;

20

and, not only that, but how relation back has been

21

construed by the courts.

22

But just as ubiquitous is Rule 15(c)
They go hand in glove.

And Congress, in

So I don't think it's any surprise to Congress

23

now all of you -- now all of a sudden that we say, "Oh,

24

going to give us maybe four or five months longer than the

I don't think Congress is at all surprised by

has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these

11

potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we

Court, to allow relation back.

18

the parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical.

Well, in fact, Ellzey's

Mr. Felix's case has not
So, I think that

As Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rule

20

15(a) as a backstop.

21

really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter

22

of right.

23

And once the answer is filed, that

Then JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I think that, first of

24

all, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive

25

plea.

As Mr. Chan pointed out, that the Warden doesn't even

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

get the petition until it's been screened by the Court.

2

The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule

3

15(a).

4

for granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is

5

very easy to pass.

It's a very liberal pleading rule.

6

MR. PORTER:

The threshold

In Foman versus Davis, this Court

7

responded to that concern and said that District Courts

8

have ample authority under 15(a) to deny amendments to

9

petitions -- or amendments to initial pleadings.

It said,

10

for bad-faith or dilatory tactics, but then said even

11

undue delay -- so you don't even require a showing of bad

12

faith -- for prejudice to the other side.

13

So all of the concerns that the Warden has

14

raised are specifically identified by this Court to give

15

the District Court the right to deny an amendment to the

16

petition.

17

District Court are very ample, indeed.

18

And so, I believe that those powers in the

24

prevent the elongated delays that the Warden is worried

25

about in this case.

MR. CHAN:

Mr. Felix assumes that Congress knew

about the Tiller case, and assumed that Congress would

know that Tiller would be interpreted in a way as to allow

relation back in a situation such as this.
