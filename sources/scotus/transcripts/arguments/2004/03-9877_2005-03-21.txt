We'll hear argument

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the government acts to remove government-

12

imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate

13

the Establishment Clause.

14

point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases

15

those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our

16

traditions.

17

Rather, as this Court put the

The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized

18

Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on

19

restrictions by having institutions and prison officials

20

examine burdens on religious exercise and remove

21

unjustified, substantial burdens.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But, you know, when

23

you say it eases burdens, it doesn't just ease burdens

24

imposed by the Federal Government.

25

imposed by State governments.

It eases burdens

MR. CLEMENT:

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any

3

substantial difference, in part, I think because if you

4

think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's

5

Spending Clause legislation.

6

often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to

7

take action on their own.

8

can understand this legislation as giving the States an

9

opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious

And spending legislation

And in this sense, I think you

10

exercise.

11

The relevant action that a State takes is State action in

12

removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on

13

the States.

14

And that's precisely how it works in practice.

And I think that's consistent with the analysis

15

of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal

16

Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have

17

the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the

18

drinking age, but it could give the option to the States

19

to exercise their power to do it.

20

end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to

21

the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government.

So I do think in the

22

It is also true that the standard that's imposed

23

by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by

24

the Federal Constitution itself.

25

providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise

But I don't think

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment

2

Clause problem.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But in -- in the City

4

of Boerne, didn't we say that Congress couldn't come in

5

and simply rewrite some part of the Constitution to make

6

it read differently than we had?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but

8

I don't think this case poses the same problems as City of

9

Boerne.

First of all, this really isn't an effort to

10

rewrite a rule of decision for all cases the way that RFRA

11

was.

12

where there were particular problems with respect to

13

religious exercise, and in those contexts, it addressed a

14

different standard.

15

Congress in this legislation targeted two areas

Now, as I say, that standard is higher, but so

16

are the standards of over half of the States which also

17

apply a heightened scrutiny test either as a matter of

18

State constitutional law or State law.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, RFRA didn't involve a --

20

a limitation to situations in which Federal funds were

21

involved, and as I understand this statute does.

22
23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

That is also true.

I mean, there

-- there is -- to be sure there is -JUSTICE SCALIA:

More than also.

I -- that

seems to me the principal difference between this and

Scalia.

potential for applications to the statute under the

5

Commerce Clause.

6

appropriately presented here.

7

respect to State prisons in all their applications, they

8

will be Spending Clause applications.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would -- I would clarify that there is the

We don't think that's really
We also think that with

Is that -- what you're saying

10

is academic because the statute doesn't require a Federal

11

spending hook.

12

take it you -- you gave a pragmatic answer to that, that

13

every State in fact gets Federal funds for their prison

14

systems.

15

It says it has the other commerce peg.

MR. CLEMENT:

I

That's right, Justice Ginsburg,

16

and I think the fact that there may be more than one hook

17

for this legislation in certain applications shouldn't

18

make any constitutional difference.

19

is Spending Clause legislation as it applies to the State

20

of Ohio.

21

issue with whether it's valid.

22

I think that's conceded.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I think here it

They -- they take

But, Mr. Clement, it seems to

23

me the Spending Clause aspect cuts in the other direction,

24

if we're just focusing on the Establishment Clause.

25

fact that Federal money is involved, why does that make

The

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

your burden any less in defending the -- the statute under

2

the Establishment Clause?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, I don't

4

think the fact that there's money involved makes it harder

5

or easier from a Spending Clause perspective.

6

from the perspective of why this case is different from

7

Boerne, the fact that it's Spending Clause and Commerce

8

Clause and not section 5 legislation makes a big

9

difference.

I think

But I certainly don't want to leave you with

10

the impression that there's anything constitutionally

11

problematic because there's Federal money involved

12

because, of course, this Court has upheld Federal Spending

13

Clause legislation in religion areas in cases like

14

Zobrest, Mergens, Agostini, Mitchell against Helms.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you -- do you think the

16

Establishment Clause issue in this case would be the same

17

as the Establishment Clause issue in City of Boerne if we

18

-- if the Court had reached the Establishment Clause issue

19

in that case?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I don't, Justice Stevens.

Or

21

another way of answering that is I would say that even

22

though you thought there was an Establishment Clause

23

problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need

24

to find one here.

25

more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as

And part of that is because this is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the

2

exercise of religion in prisons.

3

area like the military where the Government is necessarily

4

going to be involved with religion in a way that it

5

otherwise wouldn't be.

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And I think that's an

And yet, it -- it provides an

7

unusual framework or incentive, if you will, in the prison

8

context to get religion.

9

group that espouses drinking beer every day or other

If you can find some religious

10

alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana

11

or no telling what or having certain clothing or other

12

things that would alter the conditions of the prison

13

environment, there's a real incentive here to get

14

religion.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And the --

Justice O'Connor --- Federal Government seems

19

to be trying to provide those incentives.

20

problem?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that a

Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't

22

think upon analysis it is, and I think there's a couple of

23

reasons why that's so.

24

First of all, this is not an absolute

25

entitlement to get your religious beer at 5:00 p.m. every

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

day.

2

getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison

3

walls would not satisfy the test.

It is a balancing test, and I think things like

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, the -- the language of

5

the statute is pretty strong:

6

demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive

7

means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative

8

interest.

9

unless the government

It puts quite a burden on the State.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it does, Justice O'Connor,

10

but just to take a step back, I mean, applying that same

11

standard in the Smith case, you yourself thought that a

12

general law banning marijuana use outside or -- or peyote

13

use outside --

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, I think it was.

-- peyote outside of prison would

16

be justified even under that standard.

17

fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls.

18

I would think, a

I want to make another point about the

19

incentives, though, which I think is important.

20

State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation

21

for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian

22

religions that are accommodated.

23

be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in

24

order to take advantage of things offered for religion

25

that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA

Every

Now, if there's going to

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has the virtue of making sure that all religions are

2

accommodated neutrally.

3

an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to

4

between sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's

5

the way you would have without RLUIPA involved.

6

So if there's any incentive, it's

The other point I want to make is although there

7

may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that

8

would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many

9

of the reported cases involve things that I don't think

10

people are necessarily lining up to do.

11

a number of lower court cases dealing with the

12

availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means

13

as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get

14

cold food rather than hot food.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, there are

And I don't think --

What about garb that is said

16

to be associated with the religion but also is used as a

17

cue for gang membership?

18

religion requires me to wear a beard.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Let's say a beard.

This

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think --

20

and we cite a few cases in footnote 2 of our reply brief

21

that suggest that in dealing with legitimate concerns

22

about using prison -- religious symbols or other religious

23

items as a gang signifier or a gang identifier, that the

24

-- that there have been cases where the courts, even

25

applying the heightened standard or RLUIPA or RFRA, have

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

deferred to the government officials.

2

I also think, though, it's worth noting how the

3

Federal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt

4

with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to

5

beards, would be used for gang identification or gang

6

signification.

7

if you have a medallion that could be used for those

8

purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all.

9

The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position

Ohio, I take it, takes the position that

10

that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it

11

inside your shirt.

12

signification purposes or gang identification purposes.

13

And I think that shows the kind of reasonable

14

accommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the

15

Federal Bureau of Prisons --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it can't be used for prison

What -- what about a religion

17

that it's a genuine tenet of the religion that the races

18

are to be separated and the person says, the accommodation

19

I want is never to be celled with someone who is not of my

20

race?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

I think in a case like that -- I

22

mean, obviously, this Court's recent decision in Johnson

23

would suggest that -- that the prison officials are in a

24

difficult position there and I think they could not accede

25

to that request.

And I think complying with the Equal

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Protection Clause in that context would itself be a

2

compelling interest under the statute.

3

Court in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested

4

that avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a

5

sufficient compelling interest.

6

avoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that

7

context would also be a compelling interest, and I don't

8

think there would be a least restrictive alternative.

9

so I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory

10
11

And I think this

I would think equally

And

violation in refusing that particular accommodation.
I think there -- these show that there are ways

12

to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of

13

the decisions of local prison officials but also does make

14

sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these

15

claims for religious exercise.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Does it -- does the statute

17

require the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of

18

the particular religion that's espoused?

19

groups here a Satanist group?

20

fides of the group have to be reviewed by the prison

21

authorities.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Isn't one of the

So the religion -- the bona

Well, Justice O'Connor, no more so

23

than under the Free -- the Free Exercise Clause itself.

24

mean -- and as this case, of course, comes to this Court,

2

to.

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We don't have to decide it

4

here, but it's looming.

5

does, that will have to be resolved in this and in every

6

case.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

And when it goes back, if it

That's right, Justice O'Connor,

8

but that's true under the Free Exercise Clause as well.

9

So even the Sixth Circuit, that obviously had some

10

problems with the statute, understood that on that score

11

there's no more entanglement with religion under RLUIPA

12

than there is under the Free Exercise Clause itself.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Haven't we said in at

14

least one of our cases that the government can't favor

15

religion over irreligion?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice,

17

but this Court has been clear in the context of

18

legislative accommodations of religion in particular to

19

make clear that that preference of religion over

20

irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide

21

legislative accommodations of religion without providing

22

benefits for secular organizations as well.

23

clear holding of this Court in Amos.

24
25

That was the

And I think that although this Court has
expressed concerns about religious accommodations when

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will

2

be provided to other sects -- take, for example, the

3

Kiryas Joel case.

4

there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion

5

over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations

6

for religion.

7

This Court has been quite clear that

And as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson,

8

this Court noted that that's not just the absence of a

9

constitutional problem, but there's really a

10

constitutional virtue in the legislature acting to

11

accommodate religion.

12

point in Smith in saying that even though the Free

13

Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation

14

or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and

15

in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional

16

values.

17

The Court made basically the same

If I could say a few words about the Spending

18

Clause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case.

19

suggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation

20

under the Spending Clause.

22
23

They

Now, the court below --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Is that before us on

the questions presented?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think it is not in the

24

questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think

25

it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment

2

below.

3

its practice in recent cases has been when there's one

4

constitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled

5

on below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the

6

other constitutional claims.

7

like Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case.

That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and

8
9

The Court did that in cases

And we would urge the same course here because,
although the courts have divided on this Establishment

10

Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending

11

Clause issue.

12

upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation.

13

All the courts that have reached it have

And I think that reflects the fact that there is

14

a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the

15

Federal conditions that are being imposed.

16

Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to

17

Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal

18

Government can insist that kosher meals are among the

19

available options.

20

Government is going to provide monies for Ohio to build

21

prisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and

22

are operated consistent with Federal policy such that

23

there's not discrimination on the basis of race or

religion.

Corrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in

there is a preference for accommodating mainstream

religions as opposed to non-mainstream religions.

14

Similarly, there has -- there are -- there have

15

been questions by this Court that -- that the standard

16

imposed on the State of Ohio by RLUIPA is this

17

particularly difficult or tortuous standard.

18

under State law in Humphrey v. Lane, which is cited in our

To what extent?

And I asked

the -- the racist -- the religion that says God wanted the

races to be separated and the accommodation is do not cell

22

me with someone of another race.

23

MR. GOLDBERGER:

I believe that there is -- it

24

-- the statute is pretty clear that if there is a -- if

25

it's compelling or requiring the State of Ohio to engage

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in an unconstitutional activity -- and that would be a

2

segregation of the races -- that there's a compelling

3

justification -- or a compelling governmental interest in

4

not complying with the statute or saying that the statute

5

does not apply under these circumstances.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about racist literature

7

but it's under the aegis of a religious organization?

8

that -- suppose the prison does not permit, say, a member

9

of the Aryan Nation to get that racist literature -- to

10

And

get racist literature but --

11

MR. GOLDBERGER:

To the extent that there is

12

bona fide religious literature that is racist, there are

13

-- we believe that the Constitution permits Congress or

14

any legislative body to accommodate religion in isolation

15

from other religious right --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

17

MR. GOLDBERGER:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, when you --

-- fundamental rights.
When you use the term

19

bona fide, you're introducing a new kind of factor.

20

courts evaluate the bona fides of someone claiming a

21

religion?

22

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Do

I believe they -- as a matter

23

of course, prison officials have to determine whether

24

there's a good faith request for religious accommodation

25

or whether the person is trying to seek something under --

as a ruse.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it we've done that in

3

the conscientious objector cases, United States v. Seeger

4

and Gillette.

5

MR. GOLDBERGER:

6

But to let me finish my -- my answer to Justice

That's correct.

7

Ginsburg, if -- if this Court is of the view -- or members

8

of this Court are of the view that it would be content

9

discrimination, for example, although we believe that you

10

can accommodate one fundamental right separately from the

11

other fundamental rights, then of course, if there were a

12

First Amendment violation, that too would be a compelling

13

governmental interest in justifying refusal to apply

14

RLUIPA.

15

fact, there is no reported case that any racist literature

16

has ever been permitted in -- into the prisons that we've

17

been able to find.

18

So that there is no serious problem here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in

Well, the content

19

discrimination, I take it, would be raised by someone who

20

wants to get this for political or psychological

21

reasons --

22

MR. GOLDBERGER:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's --- you would say, I'm not

24

challenging the right of the -- as a member of this

25

religious sect.

I just say, me too.

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, as I say, to the extent

2

that that's right, if there were content discrimination

3

along those lines and -- and the Court said that there

4

could not be -- it was the Court's view that it could not

5

be accommodated for religion only, then of course the --

6

then there would be a compelling governmental interest in

7

avoiding content discrimination.

8

not there's a compelling justification of dealing with

9

inflammatory literature, I don't think that's in dispute

10

In terms of whether or

in this case.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I take it

12

underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is -- is the

13

concern that this accommodation is unequal because there

14

are other First Amendment rights that are not given the --

15

that are not given the same precedence.

16

MR. GOLDBERGER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, first of all -That -- that was at least an

18

underlying concern of her question, and I think it's a

19

legitimate concern.

20

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, as -- as I read Amos,

21

Amos says that the accommodation of religion need not

22

come --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but in Amos, the Court

24

was just -- the -- the government was just saying that one

25

of its own statutes could be accommodated.

This is

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

something different.

2

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, it's not -- I'm not sure

3

that it's different for constitutional purposes, that if

4

there is a differential accommodation which the Court

5

concludes violates the First Amendment rights of someone

6

else because there's content discrimination, I'm not --

7

there is no reason to treat the source of the

8

accommodation as dispositive.

9

presence of the accommodation and whether it's broad

10

It's whether -- it is the

enough or narrow enough.

11

On the other hand, the -- we -- we do want to

12

make clear that there are numerous accommodations that

13

involve First Amendment rights that do not overlap with --

14

with religious exercise or accommodation of religious

15

exercise.

16

gatherings, they're not entitled under the First Amendment

17

to the -- they're not accommodated in the same way that

18

religious congregations in prison are accommodated.

19

this Court so far has found there to be no constitutional

20

violation for that distinction.

21

there's a compelling governmental interest, there is

22

little doubt that the -- that the prison officials can

23

simply say no.

24

not required to accommodate it under the statute.

25

To the extent that there is political

And

And to the extent that

This -- we will not accommodate it.

We're

The -- it is important to note, that the --

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

these same accommodations are routinely granted to

2

mainstream religions and that they do not shift burdens to

3

third parties.

4

there is a substantial shifting of burdens to third

5

parties.

6

by the State of Ohio was that basically that the cost of

7

security is increased because now it takes more -- or the

8

cost of prison administration is increased because it

9

takes more time to take care of these claims and requests

10

for accommodation than there would be if they didn't have

11

to attend to these --

12

In fact, where third party claims have been made

JUSTICE SCALIA:

third parties.

15

There's been substantial argument that

I'm -- I'm sorry.

You've lost

I don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to
What --

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, the argument is that

16

when, for example, a religious accommodation forces -- and

17

-- and -- the third parties to chip in, as they had to do

18

in Caldor, for example, private third parties, that that

19

renders the accommodation unconstitutional.

has been arguing that the lifting of burdens on the

religious exercise of our clients makes it harder for

their prison guards --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

the Court:

In prison's unique environment, RLUIPA violates

the Constitution.

8

perceived by objective observers as endorsement.

9

It directly and impermissibly advances

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me ask you this -- this

10

question because it -- it -- I think it goes to the -- the

11

heart of what I think is the problem in this case.

12

are going to recognize a sphere of accommodation, which we

13

have done previously, I think we have to recognize that

14

the -- that the object of accommodating and the effect of

15

accommodating is, in one sense, to benefit -- I mean, in

16

an obvious sense, is to benefit religion.

17

a sphere of accommodation, in effect, I think the Court

18

has said there is a sphere in which religion can be

19

benefitted that does not rise necessarily to the level of

20

government proselytization or -- or government

21

endorsement.

22

you're making is that if the government endorses at all,

23

it's immediately in -- in the -- the realm of

establishment.

argument?

1

MR. COLE:

Well, I think you are, Your Honor,

2

and if our brief came across that way, I -- I think it

3

overstates the line that we're asking this Court to draw.

4

The Court has recognized, in talking about accommodations,

5

that of course accommodations by their very nature benefit

6

religion.

7

said to have the effect.

8

must draw lines.

9

you can't just say, oh, it's an accommodation which means

That's part of an accommodation and could be
But the Court has said then we

That is, the Court has recognized that

10

that's fine, it's always going to be fine if it's an

11

accommodation.

12

draw lines because otherwise everything will just become,

13

oh, that's an accommodation.

14
15

In fact, Justice O'Connor said we need to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

And -- and why is

the line violated here?

16

MR. COLE:

The line is violated here, Your

17

Honor, because of the unique incentives and burdens that

18

arise in the prison context.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what the statute

20

appears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-

21

Employment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free

22

Exercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of

23

religion.

24

designed to do.

25

And that appears to be what this statute is

MR. COLE:

But in -- in prison's unique

26
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

environment, Your Honor, where there are so many

2

deprivations of liberty and then to say the one -- one way

3

you can get out from under the thumb of all these prison

4

regulations is to claim religion, and that's going to give

5

you a powerful weapon not again to --

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But -- but before Employment

7

Division v. Smith, wouldn't we have had the same question

8

arise in the prison context, and we would have dealt with

9

it under the then-standards.

10

MR. COLE:

But -- but the Court has -- has

11

always articulated that the rules -- well, in Turner and

12

O'Lone, the Court articulated that the rules are different

13

in prison, citing to the intractable problems of prison

14

administration and the -- and the problems of

15

subjecting --

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But had the Court ever said

17

that the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the

18

prison context?

19

MR. COLE:

No, Your Honor.

Going -- going back

20

to the Beto case, the Court said free exercise applies in

21

prison, but in O'Lone, the Court said it applies in prison

22

but the standard what we're going to use is one that's

23

very similar to -- to rational basis.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Then I think you're

saying that in order to exceed what free exercise requires

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in a prison necessarily forces you into establishment.

2

And I think you're saying the reason it does so is that

3

there are so many incentives on the part of prisoners to

4

claim religion, that that's the only way you can sort of

5

keep the genie in the bottle.

6

essence of your argument?

7

MR. COLE:

Isn't that the -- the

We're not asking for that bright line

8

rule, Your Honor.

9

providing kosher meals, for instance, whether that's

It could well be the case that

10

required by the Free Exercise Clause or not, it might go

11

marginally beyond what free exercise requires.

12

accommodation that would be perfectly legitimate.

13

have a rule that says anytime you bring any request of any

14

kind for an accommodation from any rule, it's going to be

15

treated differently and better because it's religion --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's an
But to

Well, it -- but -- but that is

17

not what the rule says.

18

on the other side pointed out, there's got to be some

19

determination made as a threshold matter as to whether

20

this is even a religious claim or -- or whether it's just

21

gaming the system.

22

Number one, as -- as your brother

So there's nothing automatic.

Number two, if there are, as -- as there

23

frequently will be, in the prison context important

24

governmental interests which can only be served by denying

25

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

seems to me that if these are not sufficient recognitions

2

of the -- of the prison context, then I don't know what

3

kind of a rule we can have that would satisfy you except

4

to say if it isn't absolutely required by free exercise,

5

it is establishment.

MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think we

7

need to go that far.

8

types of accommodations and say if a legislative

9

determination is made that this type of accommodation with

10

respect to this type of request is appropriate, based on a

11

balancing of all the factors to consider in that

12

particular case --

I -- I think we could look at given

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. COLE:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you --

-- that might not slide -You mean specific

16

accommodations like you can have kosher foods, you can

17

wear a religious medal, you can have a tattoo?

18

you're -- you're asking the legislature to be that

19

specific.

20

MR. COLE:

I mean,

Well, a narrow, targeted -- I guess

21

the point is, Your Honor, a narrow, targeted accommodation

22

would be different in our view than this broad, wonder bus

23

approach to accommodation.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It -- it would also be rather a

discriminatory one, wouldn't it?

I mean, one -- one point

29
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that we have got to be concerned about, whether we're

2

dealing with accommodation or whether we're dealing with

3

-- with flat-out establishment, is distinction among

4

religions.

5

distinguish among religions, we don't have this problem,

6

but I think that lands you from the frying pan into the

7

fire.

8
9

And I think you're saying if they do

MR. COLE:

No, Your Honor, I -- I don't believe

so because I think if, for instance, the legislature said,

10

you -- you shall, absent some compelling need, provide

11

prisoners with a diet that meets their religious

12

requirements, that would not discriminate among religions.

13

It would be narrowly tailored to some perceived problem

14

that might exist.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

A guy comes along in a

16

different religion and says, we're omnivorous, but we got

17

to -- we got to wear medals.

18

are okay.

19

generality in your example is higher.

20

discrimination is not quite so blatant, but it's a pretty

21

tough job to come up with -- would be a tough job to come

22

up with statutes without picking and choosing among

23

religious demands.

24
25

No statute that says medals

It -- it -- you know, I realize the level of

MR. COLE:

The -- the

And, Your Honor, we believe that in

prison's unique environment, to the extent you go beyond

30
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Free Exercise Clause, it raises special problems and

2

special concerns that need to be dealt with --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. COLE:

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why can't they --

-- on a case by case basis.
But why can't they be dealt

6

with under the statute as it is written, saying that if

7

you -- if it is a bona fide request, and you, the prison,

8

determine that in fact you -- you have a compelling State

9

interest that cannot be served in any other way, you can

10

say no?

11

-- why is that, therefore, the reason that -- that jumps

12

us into an Establishment Clause violation every time?

13

Why is that insufficient and -- and why does that

MR. COLE:

It's insufficient, Your Honor,

14

because it doesn't change the underlying fact that the

15

request itself, whatever the ultimate outcome on the

16

request is, the request itself gets treated differently

17

and better merely because it's religious.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This is a --

Well, are you saying that --

19

that a statute is unconstitutional to recognize a

20

prisoner's right to free exercise unless it also has a --

21

a kind of a litany of sections recognizing speech rights,

22

recognizing privacy rights, et cetera?

23
24
25

MR. COLE:

No, Your Honor.

I'm -- I'm not

suggesting that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then it's got to single out

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

religion.

2

MR. COLE:

And -- and as the Court noted in

3

Amos, these type of statutes are necessarily going to

4

single out religion, but that doesn't shield them from

5

Establishment Clause scrutiny just because they take the

6

form of being directed at religion and providing a benefit

7

that's -- that's labeled as an accommodation.

8
9

I mean, for instance, Congress could say, look,
we think it's difficult for State prisoners to practice

10

their religious beliefs when they can't go to church.

11

absent some compelling State interest and least

12

restrictive alternatives, the prisons need to arrange to

13

release prisoners once a week to go to the church or

14

synagogue of their choice.

15

awfully powerful incentive inside prison walls for

16

prisoners to -- to claim religion.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure it woul --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So maybe that's --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if you did it under the

Well, that would provide an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

this statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith -- our pre-Smith

23

24

defined religious exercise as broadly as this statute

defines it.

I'm not aware that our pre-Smith law would have

includes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled

that far?

That is --

Did our prior Smith cases go

I'm not aware that -MR. COLE:

No, they did not, Your Honor, and I

think that's an important as well, that once someone has

9

an -- a bona fide religion and -- and prison officials can

10

challenge whether this is in fact a religious set of

11

beliefs.

12

if they are sincere, then you can't challenge this

13

particular request as not being mandated by the religion.

14

No.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your Honor --- generally.

I don't need a

bright line rule.

17

about this that violates the clause if it isn't the first

18

thing or the second thing that I mentioned.

19

MR. COLE:

I'm just trying to find out what it is

It's the magnitude by which Congress

20

has enhanced the religious right.

21

what the Constitution requires State prison officials to

22

do and we say, how far has Congress moved the ball.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

That is, we compare

Now, in respect to that,

24

we have two points.

25

which is that Congress is not enlarging it, but for my

Smith had never been decided.

Congress did enlarge it, namely, that the right doesn't

9

And the second is Justice

It could

So is your whole argument then pinned on that
latter point?

And if it is not, again, what is it?

MR. COLE:

Well, our argument is pinned on this

10

Court's decisions in Turner and O'Lone, which we see as

11

establishing the baseline for what type -- for what the

12

Constitution requires in terms of free exercise in prison,

13

and then we use that baseline and compare the standard

14

imposed there to the standard Congress is seeking to

15

impose through RLUIPA and compare the magnitude of the

16

two, understanding, as this Court has said in Lemon, that

17

lines of demarcation are difficult to perceive.

18

difficult to say exactly where that line should be.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's

You're saying if Turner had

20

come up prior to Smith, the Court would have said that

21

Turner trumps pre-Smith law, and you don't have to follow

MR. COLE:

I believe Turner and O'Lone are

prison cases that talk about what the Constitution means

in prison, understanding that in prison there need to be

changes to what we would otherwise see as the inmates'

5

constitutional rights if they were not in prison.

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Now, I -- I understand the
Very well.

From the prison's point of view, why is it so
burdensome since you would have thought security is a

10

compelling interest, prison administration is a compelling

11

interest, so that really all we have to do is think about

12

this and look to see whether there isn't some reasonable

13

way of accommodating the request?

14

MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

15

burdens in the prison environment are twofold.

16

RLUIPA forces prison officials to change the balance they

17

would otherwise strike between safety and accommodation,

18

and by changing that balance, changing the margin of

19

safety, if you will, they're now imposing risks on the

20

other inmates that are in prison.

21

merely --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First,

And these aren't

I think -- I think you may

23

exaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State

24

interest.

25

in the pre-Smith days that it was a compelling State

I mean, we -- this -- this Court held in the --

declared a -- a compelling State interest under this

statute, don't you think?

6

I mean, if that's a compelling State

MR. COLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And compelling

7

State interest doesn't present a problem to the State of

8

Ohio or to the other States that are operating under this

9

statute.

What it -- what presents the problem is the

10

least restrictive alternative part of that which subjects

11

State prison officials in their day-to-day judgments

12

regarding prison operations to a strict scrutiny analysis

13

on the back end.

MR. COLE:

Well, the United States claims no,

Your Honor, of course.

5

unconstitutional, we presented substantial evidence in the

6

-- in the joint appendix with regard to the way in which

7

there was an explosion of demands for accommodations by

8

prisoners from previously unheard of religions.

9

an expansion -- an explosion of claims of conversion

11

But when we look back at the

There was

within -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but now that some of

12

that has gotten sorted out through the experience of the

13

Bureau of Prisons on the Federal side, one would expect

14

there would be less of those far-out claims.

15

would expect when a statute is new, that there might be

16

some claims that we would recognize as frivolous after

17

there's been experience under it.

18

MR. COLE:

The -- you

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

19

difficulty that doesn't seem to go away with the least

20

restrictive alternative test is -- is the possibility, as

21

this Court noted in Turner, that every judgment every day

22

is subject to some court somewhere finding that there was

23

a less restrictive way of achieving the goal.

24

we see that --

This is true.

all I can do is go back and compare the accommodation if

effect on the Federal ground.

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, I -- I don't know that it

15

hasn't.

16

that claim because in brief period in which RFRA did apply

17

to State prisons, there was an explosion of these demands.

18

And -- and I would direct the Court to, I believe it's,

20

of the ways in which there's been this impact.

MR. COLE:

Your Honor, I don't know that the

5

fact that -- that strict scrutiny might become -- what

that means, what that's going to require.

7

this is a slightly different strict scrutiny than other

8

strict scrutinies because of some of the legislative

9

history, to the extent one -- one wants to look at that.

10

And arguably,

And -- and that's, I guess, the problem.

As we

11

flesh that out, during that entire time, we're saying it's

12

all right to burden other inmates in prisons.

13

right to burden prison officials.

14

Congress not to burden Federal prison officials, but for

15

Congress to burden State prison officials with this new

set of obligations.

in Dole that there needs to be relatedness between the

for harm here.

is what's the closest analogy you can --

MR. COLE:

In our brief we -- we looked at Lee

v. Weisman in what the Court called subtle and indirect

coercion to religion when it was merely standing for a --

10

a invocation during graduation once a year.

contrast that with what's going on here and the constant

The question is by changing the

10

this Court said in Turner, given what this Court said in

question is, is it permissible for Congress to create

incentives for prisoners to say, yes, I'm religious

going to provide that incentive is by giving you a better

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few points in rebuttal.

6

First of all, I'd like to note the anomaly that

7

much of the argument of General Cole would be an argument

8

for why the State constitutional provision that gives

9

higher protection for freedom of conscience in Ohio is

10

itself unconstitutional.

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Why don't you address the

12

ways in which this act goes beyond our former free

13

exercise --

14

MR. CLEMENT:

I'd be happy to do that, Justice

15

O'Connor.

16

how far it goes beyond.

17

thing, which is this Court, even before Smith and O'Lone,

18

said that there was going to be deference to prison

19

officials and a Turner standard would apply.

20

extent that there's a little less deference here than

21

under the O'Lone standard, that is a modification.

22

I think that there's been an exaggeration of
Now, I want to be clear about one

So to the

The centrality requirement, though, is not

23

something that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because

even before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and

25

Hernandez was moving away from centrality and --

Well, Justice Scalia -It's not compelled.

our prior religion cases did -- did, indeed, require some

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, I don't think this

12

Court has ever in its accommodations cases held that the

13

government can only accommodate those things that are

14

central.

15

employing co-religionists in a gymnasium is central to the

16

practice of any faith.

17

that as a valid accommodation.

I don't know for sure, but I rather doubt that

I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

I was thinking of free exercise cases rather than

establishment cases.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I think that's right,

15

and I think there is not that centrality requirement for

16

accommodations.

17

I do want to make the point, though, that --

18

that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this

19

heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least

20

restrictive alternative tests and the like.

21

Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution.

22

That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison

23

context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than

24

an inmate.

Nobody thinks

1

It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments

2

would suggest their own accommodations of some religions

3

would give too much of an incentive for religious exercise

4

and the like.

5

And I think that's a defect as well.

I don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter

6

in this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually

7

raise more constitutional problems than broader

8

accommodations.

9

Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly

I think that this Court, for example, in

10

high level of generality, but yet this Court said and

11

Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well,

12

that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions.

13

think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board

14

test.

15

And I

Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether

16

this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates

17

religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the --

18

than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across

19

the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of

20

State actions.

21

accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader

22

standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a

23

constitutional defect.

25

So in that sense, the fact that it

The last point I wanted to make is on the racist

2

points out, prisons have been generally successful in

3

keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as

4

a claim for religious-based racist literature.

5

cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is

6

when the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it

7

that made very little sense.

12

others were not allowed to have that same kind of

literature.

able to go forward in a case like this.
