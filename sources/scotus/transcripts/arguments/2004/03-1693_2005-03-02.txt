ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. STAVER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. STAVER:

Justice Stevens and may it

please the Court.
Before this Court is a setting of law in a
courthouse and a display on law that contains the

10

universally recognized symbol of law.

11

fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of

12

this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit

13

struck it down.

14

religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's

15

aired by ignoring the overall context.

16

Despite the

The Court focused solely on the

The Ten Commandments is unlike most any

17

other acknowledgment.

It is in a category

18

essentially all by itself.

19

places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and

20

menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on

21

public property.

22

frequently and has for more than a century in

23

courthouses all over this nation.

24

with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because

25

the Ten Commandments has played an influential role

It is thematic in common

The Ten Commandments occurs quite

in American law and government and our system of law

2

in this country.

4

The context in this case is clearly
important.

5

Yet the Sixth Circuit -JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you there

6

basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia

7

made in the course of the last argument?

8

context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in

9

the course of litigation over this and it started out

10

with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version

12

surrounded by certain quotations of religious content

13

from other texts.

14

The

15

with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten

16

to the present context.

17

have to face, as I've said before, what Justice

18

Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going

19

on.

20

simply litigation dressing and that the object for

21

what is going on is the object that was revealed in

22

the first place.

Isn't the problem that you

MR. STAVER:

Several.

stand-alone Ten Commandments.

2

could have defended that but they chose instead to

3

switch rather than fight because they wanted to try

4

to comply with this Court's establishment clause

5

jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to

6

display this particular document.

7

however, on a land mine admittedly with this second

8

display.

MR. STAVER:

They were sued.

bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially

in the area of displays.

16

Remember this was back in

At that time, there were less than a

17

handful of reported decisions ever in this country on

18

the Ten Commandments.

19

20

are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and

21

23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they

22

didn't have really any guidance.

23

follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but

24

these are governmental officials.

foundation is display and as the District Court

3

recognized, it is fundamentally different than any

4

previous display.

5

But what they have now is the

Like this Court's decision in the Sunday

6

law cases, even though it may have started off for a

7

religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to

8

be retained for secular reasons.

9

In this case --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you saying that the

11

purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't

12

matter?

13

MR. STAVER:

We're saying that in this

14

case, the purpose is about the display of law.

15

also have an argument later on that this Court should

16

reconsider the purpose in generally as it relates to

17

the Lemon test.

other purpose than the display of the Ten

theistic part of the text?

2

MR. STAVER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

District Court actually recognized that one of the

4

omni intended effects of the history is to educate

5

everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment

and an establishment.

religious purpose has been buried and has been

abandoned.

And even if they had a

They voluntarily accepted the --

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're not abandoning

12

the position that you have a right to make this kind

13

of religious display, are you?

14

MR. STAVER:

No, we're not.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. STAVER:

Okay.

And that's why we said that

17

they could have defended the individual first display

18

which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because

19

it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law

20

and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse.

21

They could have defended when they were originally

22

sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to

23

modify the display.

24

display, it had excerpted sections around it.

25

And when they modified the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is there -- I

Washington, DC 20005

1

guess -- I don't want to tie you up too long but I

2

mean given the history, isn't it still the case that

3

there is no serious reason to believe that there is

4

any object here other than the display of the Ten

5

Commandments including the overtly theistic text and

6

the rest of this is basically enabling context which

7

does not affect the objective, the objective being

8

the Ten Commandments and the religious text?

9

MR. STAVER:

Your Honor, they must be able

10

to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that

11

they had.

12

superimposed on the foundation's display forever and

13

the question would be --

14

Otherwise, that past case would be

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, not forever but

15

for now.

This isn't a case in which they came up

16

with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined

17

and 10 years later somebody comes along and says,

18

let's have a display of important documents in the

19

history of law.

20

and it is a continuous process within the context of

21

litigation about the constitutionality of the

22

display.

23

you can never have a different display but that there

24

is no reason to believe that the intent of this

25

display has changed as the context has changed.

This in fact is a continuous process

It's not a -- the implication is not that

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

What is your response to that?

2

MR. STAVER:

The intent has certainly

3

broadened in this case and there is clearly no

4

evidence in this record that this foundations display

5

is solely purposed or intended to be a religious

6

display.

7

wrote against us said that on the face of this

8

display, it appears secular in nature.

9

In fact, even the respondents of amici that

It does.

In fact, the foundations display not only

10

has numerous other documents of which the Ten

11

Commandments is only one tenth of these many other

12

document but it also has a foundations document that

13

says what the purpose is about.

14

places that talk about the purpose on the foundations

15

display.

16

There is only two

On the document itself, which says it's a

17

display about some documents that influenced American

18

law and government, and the undisputed testimony that

19

these are documents that reflect documents that have

influenced American law and government.

21

record before this Court on the foundations display

22

and that is fundamentally different --

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the

MR. STAVER:

That is arguably

Do we take it along

5

with the resolution of the counties?

6

everything?

7

MR. STAVER:

Do we look at

Your Honor, there was no

resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display.

9

It just went up.

10
11
12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So just that first

display, what was the purpose of that first one?
MR. STAVER:

The purpose of that first one

13

is like it is in many courthouses around the country.

14

Both courthouses have numerous documents of his

15

historical nature along the walls,284 just in the

16

curia alone.

17

when they celebrated their 200th anniversary in 1999.

18

So that was one of many documents that's there and

19

that was a document of the Ten Commandments that was

20

meant to show the historic nature of the Ten

21

Commandments, how it has in fact influenced American

22

law and government in the appropriate setting of a

23

courthouse.

And in Pulaski, many, many documents,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was there anything there

2

that said we're interested in history and what we're

3

not interested in is having this on the wall as -- to

4

encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage

5

them to study religion and to understand that in

6

their lives, religion should be important and this

very solemn secular setting.

is important.

10

Nonetheless, religion

Is there anything like that on the

MR. STAVER:

No, it was just the document

11

itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other

12

documents.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if its purpose were

14

to demonstrate -- and I quote from one of our earlier

15

opinions -- that we are a religious people whose

16

institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.

17

that were its purpose?

18

MR. STAVER:

What if

Would that have made it bad?
I don't believe so, Justice

19

Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement

20

that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus

21

Chambers.

22

prayers before legislative sessions or suggested that

23

the national motto is constitutional because indeed

24

we are a religious people as this Court has said more

25

than five times.

That's why this Court has authorized

We are a religious people.

11

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

institutions do presuppose the existence of a Supreme

2

Being.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is it your position

4

that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not

5

agree with that message?

6

MR. STAVER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

Justice Kennedy, it would not inflict any

8

harm because in this case, it's a passive display in

9

a courthouse in a hallway and you could simply walk

10

past that and avert your eyes once you see this.

11

inflicts no harm, it does not --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

Mr. Staver, what about

13

all the distinctions that have been made between

14

messages that are brief or I think the expression has

15

been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in

16

God we Trust, like God save the United States and

17

this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document

18

that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many

19

words devoted to that topic.

20

reference.

21

covenants that the Lord is making with his people.

22

So it's not a brief

It's a powerful statement of the

MR. STAVER:

Justice Ginsburg, the Ten

23

Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of

24

acknowledgment because of its historic role in

25

influencing our law and government.

It is displayed

12

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in this context for that unique role.

2

some statements in there about God but, frankly, very

3

few when you look at the overall context.

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It does have

Have you read the first

four commandments and could you say that?

6

MR. STAVER:

Sure.

And those are

7

definitely and decidedly religious.

8

question that the Ten Commandments is a religious

9

document.

10

There is no

There is also no question that it has

influenced our American law.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think the Ten

12

Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers

13

you've heard at the beginning of congressional

14

sessions?

15

MR. STAVER:

16

they're quite shorter.

17

No, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think

I don't know how much

18

help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of

19

the involvement of the government, is the government

20

involved in religion when it posts the Ten

21

Commandments alone?

22

Yes, of course it is.

Now, there could be a purpose to it, that

23

they want to just show the history of law but it's

24

all by itself and there is a lot more history than

25

that and context may matter a lot.

Not everybody

13

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself

2

there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far.

3

This is going too far.

Why?

Because it

4

isn't really related to history, it's the only thing

5

up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth.

6

Now, suppose I go down that track because

7

what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too

8

far and what's not.

9

assume it's too far.

But for present purposes, let's

10

Now, once they've gone too far there, the

11

next thing that happens is they keep changing it but

12

they change it pursuant to the resolution and it

13

seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to

14

surround what went too far with a number of other

15

things that would somehow make it legal.

16
17

Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it
wrong to end with?

18

MR. STAVER:

No, Justice Breyer, it is not

19

wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to

20

begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath

21

commandment which was a commandment about worship and

22

the end with the secular reason for keeping those

23

particular laws as this Court has recognized in

24

McGowan.

25

with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we

And in this case, even if they started off

14

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

contend they did not, they did not end with one and

2

they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to

3

adjust their missteps whenever they step on a

4

constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and

5

confusing to them.

6

That's what they tried to do in this case,

7

the best efforts to try to follow this Court's

8

decision when there was really no specific guidelines

9

for them to be guiding their direction.

10

The Ten Commandments that Justice Stevens,

11

you had mentioned about the versions, the versions I

12

don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in

13

this case or any other case regarding the Ten

14

Commandments because if that were the case, you

15

wouldn't be able to teach the Bible in an appropriate

16

context because there are so many different versions

17

and yet Stone and Schempp has indicated that you

18

indeed can teach even the Biblical text with all of

19

its multiple versions.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I assume if you were

21

running a course in a school about the biblical text,

22

you would explain the differences.

23

indicate the difference between the Jewish, the

24

Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and

25

you're not doing that here.

You would

1

I would have thought your answer might be,

2

well, if that really made a difference, we could have

3

separate versions.

4

teaching.

5

But it's not comparable to school

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Justice Souter, it would

6

in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're

7

teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all

8

the versions lined out.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would you think it was

10

appropriate in a public school course that was

11

otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on

12

exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version

13

of the Ten Commandments?

14

MR. STAVER:

We would believe that, in

15

fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought

16

about whether there were different versions but we

17

certainly believe that they could have the text there

18

and talk about the Ten Commandments.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In a public school,

20

wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual

21

reasons if not the reasons of the establishment

22

clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with

23

differently in the standard Roman translation and the

24

preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded

25

as commandment number 1 are different in the

Wouldn't that be an intellectually

which this is a courthouse context.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Exactly.

I thought you

were equating the two together.

8
9

That's in a school context

MR. STAVER:

Not one to one but I think

the version issue, if there is a version that flunks

10

the test, it would be this Court's south frieze.

11

It's actually in Hebrew and it speaks only to Jewish

12

people.

violates the establishment clause.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

urge you not to consider the history of the display.

7

You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case

8

made the point that in the context of accommodations,

9

the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot

10

of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that

context.

I think so too in the acknowledgment

12

context.

Certainly if you have a situation where you

13

don't have -- I think in the acknowledgment context

productive.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CLEMENT:

I think this Court has said

that you can accommodate religions.

They've also

said that you can acknowledge the role that religion

22

has played in our society and I think in both

23

prudent exercise of judicial resources.

1

what you have here is a display of a document alone

2

in the first instance that certainly was at least

3

defensible and probably constitutional, yet the

4

courts below got off on the wrong foot by saying that

5

the first display was open defiance of this Court's

6

decision in Stone against Graham and I think this

7

Court's cases themselves suggest that the contextual

8

differences between the school and the courtroom are

9

enough to at least make the display not in open

10

defiance.

11

Now there was the second display and we

12

are not here to defend the second display but that

13

was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit

14

filed against the first display.

15

if that second display was the product of bad legal

16

advice or simply frustration at the first lawsuit

17

being filed but I don't think it should make a

18

constitutional difference.

19

Now, I don't know

In the Lynch against Donnelly case, Mayor

20

Lynch, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him,

21

had a rally at the site of the creche, a press

22

conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep

23

Christ in Christmas and then he led city workers in

24

carols and said they should sing another one that

25

apparently bothers people.

Yet despite that adverse reaction to the

2

litigation being filed against the city of Pawtucket,

3

this Court upheld the display and although the

dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep

5

Christ in Christmas, the majority and the concurring

opinions did not.

mode of analysis.

And I think that is the proper

Now, the second point I think is should
these counties be faulted for trying to bring their

10

practices in compliance with the Constitution?

11

think the answer there is clearly not.

12

going to point this Court to the Marsh case that's

13

been talked about quite a bit.

14

And I

And I was

One of the things that as Professor

15

Chemerinsky said about the Marsh case that this Court

16

emphasized in that case itself and in subsequent

17

cases is the fact that the prayers there were

18

non-sectarian in the sense that they did not directly

19

invoke, say, Christ.

20

of a change that took place after the litigation

21

began.

22

But that actually is something

Prior to the litigation, there were

23

explicit references to Christ as Justice Stevens

24

pointed out in footnote 2 of his dissent in that

25

case.

But the state of Nebraska, after they had a
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

lawsuit, decided let's make this an easier case for

2

the Court, not a harder case, and they modified their

3

conduct.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but at the end of

5

the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what

6

they were doing was praying.

7

that the change that you're arguing for as

8

significant is only significant unless it is a change

9

in the essential activity because there is no law and

And here it seems to me

10

it would be crazy law from this Court that said you

11

can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et

12

cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough.

13

What this Court basically has said is you

14

can engage in secular objectives that incidentally

15

involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses

16

up there.

17

the county started with was a pretty

18

religious-looking exercise and the question is, did

19

they go from a totally religious exercise to a

20

secular exercise or did they go from an obviously

21

religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise?

22

And therefore, you can't make context a mere change

23

in physical context dispositive because it ignores

24

that distinction.

What you started with in this case or what

my mind the resolution of this case.

2

What do you say to that?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4
5

Justice Souter, I have two

points in response.
First of all, what I think would be a

6

crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court

7

to say that this display is a foundation to the law

8

document, it's perfectly constitutional in every

9

other county courthouse in Kentucky except for

10

McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their

11

prior conduct.

12

The second point that I think is important

13

in this context is that I think this Court's

14

establishment clause jurisprudence is already

15

difficult enough to apply without creating the First

16

Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under

17

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Basically, and I think I

19

understand you, you're saying, and I think you said

20

it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have

21

a -- try to move toward an objective criterion saying

22

there are some ways you can display religious things

23

and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to

24

develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as

25

distinct from an intent jurisprudence.
22

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

That's your point, isn't it?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

That would be my point,

3

Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that

4

point, it is also not a particular productive

5

jurisprudence to really treat different

6

municipalities differently because the mayor in one

7

case may have started with the creche and decided to

8

add the wishing well or in the other case started the

9

wishing well and added the creche.

I don't think it

10

makes any sense that if they end up in the same

11

place, the constitutional rules could be the same.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, you placed

13

heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was

14

undisguised and it was permitted to have since the

15

beginning of our nation.

16

Would it be equally compatible with the

17

establishment clause if this Court opened its daily

18

sessions with prayer?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm not

20

sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this

21

Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but

22

the Capitol can.

23

drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference

24

based on history.

25

Now, if there was any difference

I'm not sure we don't

MR. CLEMENT:

And as I said, Justice

Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in

11

history.

12

context, I think it is fair to say --

13

But I don't think there is -- in this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking you what

14

your view is of the compatibility of every federal

15

Court in the country having over the bench a replica

16

of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with

17

prayer.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I suppose

19

if the federal courts decided to do that, we would

20

probably try to defend them on establishment clause

21

grounds.

22

would obviously be a much tougher case than the

23

posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway

24

25

it to be the first case here.

amend the Lemon test to reach your approach?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending

12

it.

O'Connor.

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. CLEMENT:

To decide this case?

No, I don't.

I think it

19

would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to

20

make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate

21

the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the

22

acknowledgment context as in the accommodation

23

context we're not going to focus on that.

24
25

But independent of that, I think many of
these Court's cases that were decided even under

think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon

left of Lemon.

Now, when it did that, it didn't except

prong.

15

The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule

the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose

and an effect to endorse religion.

15

In this context, it is our position that

This Court has repeatedly and most

recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is

necessary to look at the content, the context and the

there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an

resolution that the counties enacted, the identical

resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks

after the filing of this lawsuit.

on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's

reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics.

10

They made clear that they supported the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We think it's clear

Suppose you had a county

100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the

16

same display was put on and the recitation was -- and

17

it was a sincere recitation, that the government

simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments

19

has played an important role in the civic lives of

our people.

Then you have -- they're each up for five

years and five years later, some school kids wander

23

by one and they wander by the other.

permitted in one location and not the other?

differentiate, I just don't understand that.

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

is a differentiation because this Court has made

clear that any assessment must depend on context.

There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context

one must both look at the purpose and the effect.

In

10

gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What I'm thinking -- let me spell it out.

11

words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten

12

circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate,

perhaps, and obey.

15

it would likely be a religious reaction.

The key

In other words, their reaction to

18

effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred

19

character of the law, which is fine for religious

20

people to do but not necessarily fine for the State

21

to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to

meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a

It is a question of degree, it is a

Here there is not an effort to incorporate

the primacy in its view of the Ten Commandments.

That's what it focused on.

what the District Court found at least at the

are.

That's what this

There has been no evidence taken in the
case, no discovery taken in the case to suggest

10

anything other than what the District Court found.

11

And on this record, I submit that there can be no

12

conclusion other than that the purpose of the county

13

in posting the series of displays was to post the Ten

14

Commandments because of their religious nature and

15

the effect on the reasonable observer who knew what

16

was going on, who was there to see what was

17

transpiring in this small county was clear to the

18

District Court.

19

The District Court doesn't operate in a

20

vacuum.

And this Court has made clear that courts

21

cannot turn a blind eye to a sham secular purpose.

22

The District Court not only saw the displays, heard

23

the arguments of counsel, saw the resolutions of the

was submitted in fact by the petitioners in this

case.

They submitted the resolution in support of

10

their arguments defending the second display, the

11

display that surrounded the Ten Commandments with the

12

religious text.

13

they were asserting their right to display the Ten

14

Commandments as part of their argument that the

15

purpose was to demonstrate America's Christian

16

heritage.

17

They made clear in that brief that

I submit that in that brief, in that

18

resolution, in the repeated statements of the county

19

officials and of their counsel, the District Court

20

was well within its discretion to determine that the

21

purpose here was religious, was not secular and that

22

the effect, as viewed by the reasonable observer, was

23

religious -- was to endorse religion, not secular.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The other question I

2

have is assuming you didn't have any of this history

3

and they started off with plan 3, would that have

4

violated the establishment clause?

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it

6

would.

It would be a closer question but in this

7

context, what we have is the assertion that the Ten

8

Commandments are the source, the moral background of

9

the Declaration of Independence, the foundation of

10

our legal system.

11

Commandments as part of a neutral course of study.

12

It is not like having Moses along with 15 other or 15

13

law givers.

It is not incorporating the Ten

It is the assertion of the primacy of

I don't understand the

difference.

the establishment clause, it would equally do so if

18

you said it's a major part of or even a part of.

I mean it seems to me it would violate

Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's

20

the exclusive one.

21

we're not grading papers here.

22

whether it violates the establishment clause depends

23

upon whether you're endorsing -- whether you're

24

proselytizing religion.

25

It may make it more wrong but

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It seems to me that

I think that's correct,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What does primacy have

to do with it?

4

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think it makes it an

5

easier case when it asserts this is the one rather

6

than one of several or one of many.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But your real position

8

is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as

9

they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that

10

would be enough?

11

MR. FRIEDMAN:

12

content and context of the display.

13

I think it depends on the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Exactly what we've got

in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have

the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying

JUSTICE SOUTER:

simply that it's even easier to do it when there is

decide whether to apply it to both text and symbol,

though it certainly could.

17

My point was

The Court doesn't need to go so far as to

depending on what the symbols are.

unless the content and the context make clear that it

is neutralizing.

3

The examples are obvious.

The display of

4

religious art in a government owned art museum, the

5

playing of religious music by a government symphony

6

orchestra, the context of the orchestra, the context

7

of the museum are sufficient to neutralize the

8

religious message that is contained in the display

9

itself.

10

Here -- and the same thing I think would

11

be said of a comparative religion course or a compare

12

and contrast ancient moral code course.

13

is not an endorsement of a particular code, a

14

particular text but rather a neutral educational

15

display about several alternative ones.

16

That is different from taking one

religious code, one revealed Word of God, placing it

worthy of equal reverence.
