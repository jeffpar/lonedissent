CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

When the Sixth Circuit withdrew its judgment

11

affirming the denial of habeas corpus relief 6 months

12

after this Court denied certiorari review, it exceeded its

13

authority to act under both the rules of appellate

14

procedure and this Court's decision in Calderon v.

15

Thompson.

16

As to the rules, rule 41(d)(2)(D) requires,

17

without exception, that the court issue a mandate

18

immediately upon the filing of an order of this Court

19

denying certiorari.

20

But because the court had no discretion under the rule to

21

do anything other than to issue that mandate, its

22

subsequent action withdrawing its judgment was tantamount

23

to a recall of the mandate, which, under this Court's

24

precedent in Calderon, cannot be justified in this case

25

because the evidence simply does not support a miscarriage

That did not happen in this case.

of justice, which under Calderon means actual innocence of

2

the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you're -- if you're going to

4

-- if you're going to consider something that wasn't a

5

recall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider

6

it as a rule 41(b) action?

7
8

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, we don't read rule 41(b)

as allowing any sort of recall authority.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

-- did they?

11

recalled it?

They didn't recall it, didn't

Did they recall it?

12

MS. SMITH:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MS. SMITH:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Rule 41

They issued it and then

The mandate was not recalled Fine.

-- because it was never issued.
Correct.

So we did -- they

16

didn't recall it.

17

do with recalls.

18

41(b) says the court may shorten or extend the time for

19

issuing.

20

apply to what occurred here?

21

So, of course, 41(b) does not have to
41(b) has to do with issuances, and

Now, why wouldn't that be the obvious rule to

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, that is not -- not the

22

rule applicable here because that rule applies in a

23

different context.

24

the post-judgment proceeding.

25

That applies at an earlier stage of

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. SMITH:

Rule 41(b) specifically deals with

2

the 7-day period of -- of time for issuance following the

3

expiration of the time for a petition for rehearing or the

4

disposition of that petition for rehearing.

5
6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

it or -- or in fact truncate it, can't it?

7

MS. SMITH:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

And the court can -- can extend

It can, Your Honor, at that point.
What -- what if the court then

-- I'm -- let me just get to -- and I think this is

10

consistent with Justice Breyer's question.

11

court, at the -- at the point cert was denied and

12

rehearing was denied, simply said, I -- we're now

13

operating under (b) and we're extending the time?

14

MS. SMITH:

What if the

Because the more specific provision

15

-- what the court had actually done was to stay the

16

mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari.

17

the -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh.

The -

That's -- that's what it

19

did, but what if the court had -- had been more articulate

20

about what -- what it -- it was doing or may have been

21

doing and -- and simply said -- at the moment at which the

22

-- the rehearing period expired for cert, said, all right,

23

we're still not issuing the mandate and we're operating

24

under subsection (b), we're extending the time.

25

is -- is there anything in the rule that, at least in

Would -

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

terms, would have precluded the court from doing that if

2

it had said that?

3

MS. SMITH:

I think that simply a plain reading

4

of the rule and looking at the rule as a whole would

5

preclude that result.

6

specific language that -- that Your Honor is referring to

7

speaks in terms of shortening or extending the time, the

8

time being the 7-day period for issuance.

9

period is simply a period to allow the clerk a window of

And the reason is that the -- the

That 7-day

10

time to get the mandate out after the rehearing period has

11

expired or after the rehearing has been disposed of.

12

it does not give the court carte blanche to simply

13

withhold the mandate.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, there are -- are they

any -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you would make the

17

same argument to that that -- that you were making

18

earlier, I assume, that to read it that way would -- would

19

be to nullify Calderon.

20
21
22

MS. SMITH:

That -- that's exactly right, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, are there any

23

circumstances in which the court can -- and let's again,

24

as Justice Souter said, say that it put it on the record

25

what it was going to do, that we hereby, after the Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court has ruled in the case, will withhold -- order that

2

the mandate shall be withheld for a period of 30 days

3

because there is a -- a new case coming out on a different

4

issue that may affect our -- our holdings?

5

MS. SMITH:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The court -Or that a new case has been -

7

8

outcome.

Yes, or after disposition by

this Court on it -

The rule does not allow for that

withholding of the mandate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No -- so no circumstances can

21

has denied the petition for writ of certiorari?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. SMITH:

If the -Under no circumstances?

pending the petition for writ of certiorari and that

petition has been denied, the rule requires the immediate

2

issuance.

3

Now, there -- there may be and -- and JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but you accepted the

4

petition for rehearing in this Court would also count,

5

although the rule doesn't say that.

6

MS. SMITH:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
The rule speaks about the

8

mandate should issue when cert is denied, but in this

9

case, there was a further extension while this Court was

10

considering a petition for rehearing.

11

that was also outside the rules so that the mandate would

12

have to issue when cert is denied even if there is a

13

petition for rehearing and a request to continue the stay

14

during the pendency of that rehearing petition?

15
16
17
18
19
20

MS. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you say that

The mandate should

have issued JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you say that that was

wrong in this case too.
MS. SMITH:

That was in excess of the court's

authority under the rules.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so your view -I just want to get -- if I may

23

just get -- you say there are no circumstances in which -

24

where (d) is otherwise applicable, the mandate can -- can

25

be -- the issuance of the mandate can be extended.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the prosecutor -- did the

5

prosecutor object when there was a further extension given

6

for the pendency of the petition for rehearing?

7

MS. SMITH:

The State did not object to the -

8

to the extension, Your Honor, because the -- the mandate

9

was of no consequence to the State in terms of the State's

10

actual -- a State court proceedings.

11

need the mandate to go forward with its proceedings, and

12

in fact, the State was not authorized under State law to

13

even seek an -- an execution date until the time had

14

expired for rehearing.

15

The State did not

So -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not

16

clear about the facts here.

Did -- did the court -- did

17

the court comply with (b)?

Did it shorten or extend the

18

time?

19

shortening or extending the time, or did the court just

20

ignore the deadline and -- and act later?

21

Was there any issuance of a -- of a -- of an order

MS. SMITH:

The court simply ignored the -- the

22

-- the process of -- of the case -- the extension ability

23

in subsection (b) was never invoked by the court.

24

was a timely petition for rehearing filed, which

25

automatically stayed the mandate under subsection (d)(1).

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The petitioner, or the -- the

10

the matter, stay the mandate pending a petition for writ

11

of certiorari, and that was -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then I guess that the -- that

14

the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the

15

court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must

16

issue 7 calendar days after.

17
18

MS. SMITH:
yes, sir.

19
20
21

That is our reading of the rule,

JUSTICE BREYER:

But isn't that the reading of

circuit?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does that reading of the rule

22

require that a decision to extend the time be set forth in

23

any particular form of order or any written document?

24
25

MS. SMITH:

It's our -- it's our reading of the

rule that -- that the language employed in subsection (b)

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

implies some affirmative action of -- of the court.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Maybe they internally

3

did affirmatively decide to extend the time, but they just

4

didn't enter an order.

5
6

MS. SMITH:

Would that count?

I don't think so, Your Honor.

A

court in -- in our view -

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if they called counsel

8

and said, we've decided to delay extending the time?

9

Would that -- but we're -- we're going to extend the time,

10

but we're not going to bother to enter an order.

11

that constitute an extension?

12

MS. SMITH:

13

an extension.

14

requires some -

15
16

I don't think that would constitute

I think the language in subsection (b)

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It requires a written

document -

MS. SMITH:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would

-- some affirmative order -- saying for how long it's

going to be extended?

20

MS. SMITH:

Some affirmative order of the court

21

not only saying we're going to extend the -- the time, but

22

to give an alternative time.

23

not allow for -- for an indefinite withholding of a

24

mandate.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That -- subsection (b) does

Well, they apparently did

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

decide to extend the time for whatever time it took them

2

necessary to review the files that this particular judge

3

became aware of during this period.

4

extend the time because they didn't issue it.

5

MS. SMITH:

All this record shows, Your Honor,

6

is that the mandate did not issue.

7

is -- is not clear.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

So the reason for that

Did the court give any

explanatory reason for what it did?

10
11

They did, in fact,

MS. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

There is no order

in this record explaining why the mandate did not issue.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but the opinion of Judge

13

Suhrheinrich -- I forget his name -- explains in great

14

detail why he thought they needed more time before the

15

mandate issued.

16

why he extended the mandate.

17
18

I don't know why that isn't explaining

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But a single judge

doesn't have the authority, does he?

19

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, I believe that a single

20

judge would have the authority to extend the mandate, but

21

a single judge would not have the authority to grant

22

rehearing because that would be a determination of -- of

23

the case.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Smith, this -- unlike the

Calderon, which is a -- was a -- a court has authority to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

recall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to

2

be a really idiosyncratic case.

3

extraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, I

4

wrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally

5

okay, and now I discovered in the file things I never saw

6

before.

7

that this person may not have been competent when he

8

committed the crime, may not have been competent when he

9

-- when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very

10

This is a death case.

I mean, this was an

I have reason to suspect

moment.

11

A judge in that situation -- he finds something

12

that looks like it's the -- it's -- it's the key piece of

13

evidence in favor of the defendant.

14

submitted.

15

opinion saying this man, as far as the Federal courts are

16

concerned, goes to the State and they can set their date

17

of execution and all that -- that was an -- this case is

18

so idiosyncratic that I'm concerned about dealing with

19

41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.

20

Somehow it never got

A judge, knowing that he has written an

MS. SMITH:

It is an unusual situation, Your

21

Honor, but the court did more than simply write an

22

opinion.

23

and that judgment became final and became the final word

24

of the court upon entry -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The court entered a judgment on that opinion,

He couldn't have recalled the

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

opinion because of the extraordinary circumstance.

2

God, I made a mistake.

3

could he?

4

MS. SMITH:

My

He couldn't recall the opinion,

The court always have the -- the

5

safety valve of -- of its recall power under extraordinary

circumstances.

8

reason, I overlooked this.

Now, in a habeas case, that extraordinary

10

evidence was in front of the court.

11

had this deposition for 21 months before that first

12

opinion was entered and that first judgment was entered.

13

So this was not something -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Judge Suhrheinrich

Let -- let me ask you this.

15

Your -- I think you say that you -- you cannot extend the

16

period for issuance of a mandate after the Supreme Court

17

has denied the petition.

18

mandate and then recall it under Calderon?

19

MS. SMITH:

Could the court then issue the

That's precisely what the court

20

should have done in this case, Your Honor, in -- in our

21

view.

22

court should have looked at this extraordinary

23

circumstance, this -- this unusual circumstance, and made

24

the determination under Calderon whether that met the

25

standard for a miscarriage of justice under the habeas

decisions of this Court, specifically Calderon.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you surveyed the circuits?

3

I know this -- what -- what you describe as the practice

4

certainly wouldn't have been in the First Circuit.

5

in the D.C. it was, but I mean, we would have thought that

6

we have the power over our own mandate.

7

it hasn't issued and some extraordinary thing comes along

8

requiring a revision, we would have revised it.

9

Maybe

And of course, if

So when you read the rules and you say that's

10

what we argue, you're not arguing it about any court that

11

I'm familiar with as an appeals court.

12

looked up the appeals courts and found that in fact there

13

is at least one court or two or maybe more that follow the

14

interpretation that you're arguing for?

15
16

MS. SMITH:

So -- so have you

Your Honor, we have not done that

type of -- of inventory.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if you have not, then my

18

experience would be you're arguing for a rule that no

19

appeals court follows, that -- that all think they have

20

power over the mandate, and that the question becomes one

21

of whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the

22

mandate.

23

MS. SMITH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Your Honor If there was a good reason,

they could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't.

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But Justice Ginsburg has set forth what sounds

2

to me like an excellent reason, that the judge discovered

3

he had made an error that could mean life or death or jail

4

or innocence, and before that opinion issues, I want to be

5

sure it's correct.

6

Now -- now, that's how I'm thinking, that the

7

general practice is contrary to what you say, that the

8

question is a good reason, and that here there could

9

hardly be a better one.

10

MS. SMITH:

So what is your response?

Your Honor, our response to that is

11

-- is twofold.

12

Rules of -- of Appellate Procedure can be abrogated by the

13

consensus of the circuits.

Number one, I don't think that -- that the

15

been wrong in their interpretation.

16

MS. SMITH:

And all the circuits have just

If the circuits are not complying

17

with the plain language of the rule, then -- then, yes,

18

they have.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

circuits have that interpretation.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't either.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Has Justice Breyer conducted

We don't know that all the

the kind of investigation he asked you about?

MS. SMITH:

It struck me as just

This is an unusual case in the way

4

that it's set out in Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion, Your

6

way that -- that it should have played out -- and the way

it should have played out was that the mandate should have

that circumstance, assuming there was actually an

8

extraordinary circumstance, actual innocence of the

9

offense or actual innocence of the death penalty, which we

10

don't think was shown in this case -- what the court could

11

do in our view is to invoke its authority under rule 2 to

12

suspend the rules for good cause.

circumstance, given the finality of the judgment, the good

cause must rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice

of the court of appeals panel who decided the merits of

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, there is a disagreement

in the opinion itself that JUSTICE STEVENS:

As to how serious it was.

I

10

understand.

11

understood to be a representation of Judge Suhrheinrich

12

that he did not know about this study, did not know -- it

13

had not gotten into the record, and neither did anybody

14

else on the panel, even though, it seems to me, sort of

15

strange that nobody did know it?

16

But do you dispute the factual predicate or the fact that

17

-- that they did not know that this study was available?

18

But do you -- do you disagree with what I

MS. SMITH:

I have to confess that.

Judge Suhrheinrich represented that

he was unaware of the deposition, and I have no way to

own personal representation.

But the -- the point that I was making earlier,
this deposition in no way renders the -- the defendant

does not even make a prima facie showing of insanity under

Tennessee law, as I've stated earlier.

the mitigating circumstance under the statute, and as this

court held in Sawyer v. Whitley, simply additional

MS. SMITH:

That's -- that's exactly right, Your

Honor.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. SMITH:

That's how I read the case.

In Sawyer v. Whitley, this Court

12

specifically said that and rejected the -- the contention

13

that additional mitigation -- mitigating evidence would

14

render a defendant ineligible of the death penalty.

15

this does not satisfy the actual innocence extraordinary

So

Nor would it have -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that -- that may be but

18

the -- the fact that this sort of evidence would

19

ultimately be kept out from the court of appeals and

20

ultimately from the district court may be a very good

21

reason for us not to adopt your analysis that what

22

happened here is the equivalent of a mandate issuing and a

23

mandate being recalled.

24

prefer a different analysis.

25

MS. SMITH:

It may be a very good reason to

There are any number of reasons.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

why it was not presented.

The answer is

hasn't issued.

If it's that

Your Honor -That's -- that's my point and

-- and you may want to respond to that.
MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, my response to that is

it is not that important, and when I say that, it is not

20

that important because it would not even have defeated

21

summary judgment.

22

The -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I presume your -- your

23

answer would also be that if it's a good reason for -- for

24

not issuing the mandate, as you're supposed to, it would

25

equivalently be a good reason to recall the mandate.

We

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

-- we crossed that bridge in Calderon.

MS. SMITH:

That is precisely the argument that

we are making, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I take it you also

5

recognize that the bridge that we did not cross in

6

Calderon was -- was in answering the question whether -

7

in a case in which a court does not issue the mandate, we

8

are going to construe the court's authority, its -- its

9

discretion narrowly or broadly.

10

And that is the issue

before us here, isn't it?

11

It is, Your Honor.

The issue here

12

is -- is whether Calderon extends to this situation.

think it does.

MR. SHORS:

Justice Scalia, it was proper for

several reasons.

11

First, rule 41(b) does not require a court

order.

14

may extend or shorten the time.

If you look at the history of the rule, one of

the reasons the advisory committee specifically rejected a

reading of rule 41(c) that would have made the mandate

effective when it should have issued is that you can never

19

know from looking at the docket alone whether the non-

issuance of the mandate was because of a clerical error or

And I did want to get back to the final reason I

18

think that the State was not the victim of unfair surprise

19

in this case, and that is there was a Federal court stay

20

of execution in this case.

21

aware of the importance of securing a final judgment in

22

the court of appeals before returning to State court.

23

as this Court held in Calderon, this Court rejected the

24

State's view that a Federal habeas appeal is final when

25

cert is denied.

California in that case.

2

This Court instead specifically tied the State's

3

interest in finality to issuance of the appellate court

4

mandate.

5

think, of drawing a sharp distinction between the moment

6

at which the court of appeals relinquishes jurisdiction

7

over a case and permitting the court to correct errors

8

before then.

9

That's consistent with the unbroken history, we

In fact, this Court also in Calderon

10

specifically noted that it was not a case where the

11

mandate had been stayed pursuant to a (d)(1) motion.

12

There is no reason to distinguish a case involving the

13

non-issuance of a mandate under rule 41(b) from a case

14

involving a stay of the mandate under rule (d)(1).

15

are both circumstances in which the court of appeals still

16

has the case, and if the court of appeals still has the

17

case and recognizes a clear error in its prior decision or

18

wishes to apply a new precedent to its decision or

19

discovers that new evidence bears on a question, it has

20

wide discretion to reconsider that judgment before

21

relinquishing jurisdiction over the case.

in the State's brief, and indeed their amicus concedes

that -- that our reading of rule 41(b) is consistent with

18

Federal law, and the only question is whether the State's

interest in finality becomes somehow more significant the

21

First, that this is a -- a challenge to a rule

MR. SHORS:

Justice Scalia, I think it's a

3

little different only because in Calderon it was only an

4

inherent power question, and this Court read the exercise

5

of that inherent power in light of AEDPA.

6

involves a rule of general application that authorizes a

7

practice.

8

for that practice is the abuse of discretion standard.

9

This case

And the -- the proper standard of review for -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't -- but why

10

wouldn't that be read in light of AEDPA as well?

11

whether it's a common law rule or a rule that -- that's

written down, why equally shouldn't they be read in light

13

of AEDPA?

14

MR. SHORS:

I mean,

The abuse of discretion standard

15

absolutely would vary depending on the facts and

16

circumstances of a case.

17

particular exercise of rule 41(b) power was contrary to

18

AEDPA, it would surely be an abuse of the court's

19

discretion.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if it appeared that a

Of course, isn't it also true

21

that in Calderon the Court didn't merely hold that it was

an abuse of discretion, they held it was a grave abuse of

23

discretion, but even -- even more serious in that case?

24
25

MR. SHORS:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and -

2

had grave doubts about the exercise of that power

3

precisely because it involved the extraordinary

4

circumstance of reaching out and taking the case back from

5

the State court system.

6

The -- the fact that the Federal stay of

7

execution was in place I think is especially important to

8

-- in addressing the State's argument, that there was

9

nothing preventing the State from going back and -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, this court -

11

this -- in this case the State court thought it was in the

12

system.

13

It -- it set an execution date.
MR. SHORS:

Justice Kennedy, it did set an

14

execution date but it was not informed either that the

15

mandate hadn't issued or that there was a Federal court

16

stay in place.

17

facts were brought to its attention, the Alley case, which

18

we cite in the red brief, the Tennessee Supreme Court

19

refused to set an execution date, ruling that it was

20

premature.
