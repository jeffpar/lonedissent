ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN A. HART

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MS. HART:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The Ninth Circuit invalidated Mr. Alford's

11

arrest and held the arresting officers in this case

12

personally liable for damages based on the closely related

13

offense doctrine.

14

Fourth Amendment principles that probable cause is an

15

objective inquiry based on all of the facts and

16

circumstances known to the officer at arrest.

17

The doctrine is contrary to fundamental

In contrast, the closely related offense

18

doctrine is a subject of inquiry that limits probable

19

cause only to those facts and circumstances closely

20

related to the offense that the arresting officer

21

announces at arrest.

22

officers observe precisely the same facts and

23

circumstances and arrest the suspect, the arrest in one

24

case can be valid and in the other invalid based only on

25

the officer's subjective legal evaluation -­

Under the doctrine, then if two

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Ms. Hart, is there any

2

requirement in Washington or generally that an officer

3

state the grounds for the arrest to the person being

4

arrested at the time?

5

MS. HART:

Justice O'Connor, there's no

6

constitutional requirement and there is no requirement in

7

-- in Washington that that be done.

8

require that it be done statutorily and many of those

9

States also -­

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

A number of States do

We're dealing here with a

11

case from the State of Washington, and you assert there is

12

no such requirement in Washington.

13

MS. HART:

There is not.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But in this case when the

15

respondent was arrested, he was informed by the officer

16

that the arrest was for making a tape recording of the

17

conversation?

18

MS. HART:

That is correct.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And it turns out -- do you

20

concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for

21

arrest?

22
23

MS. HART:

That -- at this point, the question

of the -­

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

MS. HART:

Do you concede that -­

Your Honor --

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- that in the State of

2

Washington, that it is perfectly lawful to record the

3

conversation with the police?

4

MS. HART:

This -- the facts of this particular

5

case have not been before a -- a court in Washington, Your

6

Honor.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But I'm asking you.

What is

8

your view?

9

record, tape record, the conversation with a policeman on

10

Is it lawful or not for an individual to

the occasion of a stop?

11

MS. HART:

Your Honor, I believe in this case

12

there would be probable cause for an officer to believe it

13

was and therefore effect an arrest.

14

the -- the question has been answered in Washington, and I

15

believe there are good grounds to argue that it would be

16

permissible and that, indeed, unlike the decision in State

17

v. Flora, there were distinguishing circumstances here,

18

including the absence of passers-by on the scene.

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I don't believe that

Well, do we decide this case

20

on the understanding that it was lawful to make the

21

recording?

22

case?

23
24
25

Is that the basis in which we decide this

MS. HART:

No, Your Honor.

We have not raised

the Privacy Act as an issue before this Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, for argument -­

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, Washington also has an

2

anti-stacking policy, does it?

3

MS. HART:

4

The State Patrol does, Your Honor,

yes.

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

6

the patrolmen in the State?

7

MS. HART:

8

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

9

It -They won't arrest someone for

several charges?

10
11

Is -- is that just a rule of

MS. HART:

It's an agency policy and troopers

with the Washington State Patrol are trained to it.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is it an agency policy

13

that the State endorses, and if so, why -- why do you

14

endorse or adopt the policy?

15

MS. HART:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that -­

16

that stacking charges really is -- there are good reasons

17

to endorse the policy.

18

particular --

19
20

One is that it's not a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not -- not stacking charges you

mean.

21

MS. HART:

I'm sorry.

Not stacking charges,

22

Your Honor, is -- is an -- a sound policy for a number of

23

reasons.

24

efficient use of law enforcement resources, but perhaps

25

more importantly, it can have significant negative

First, it's not a particularly effective or

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

consequences for people who are subject to arrest in terms

2

of their ability -- the amount of bail, their ability to

3

post bail, and to secure a pre-trial release.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is that -- I mean, is

5

that the -- the real basis for the policy, that we -- that

6

Washington does not want to make it difficult for -- for

7

arrestees to raise bail?

8
9

MS. HART:

Your Honor, I can't tell you

precisely what the Washington State Patrol's thinking is

10

on it.

11

-- that the appropriate law enforcement response is -- is

12

to determine whether there's probable cause and to arrest

13

and leave the sorting out of the charges to be pressed

14

actually by the State to the prosecuting attorney.

15

My impression is that, in part, they believe that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you make of the

16

argument that unless the cause of the arrest is, number

17

one, stated and, number two, a -- a cause that a defendant

18

can rely on, that in any case like this in which the

19

stated grounds of the arrest turn out to be -- we will

20

assume, turn out to be inadequate, the police will always,

21

particularly in traffic cases, be able to come up with

22

something later on to justify the arrest?

23

you make of that argument?

24
25

MS. HART:

What -- what do

Well, I -- I think what I would make

of it, Justice Souter, is that provided that there's

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

probable cause for arrest, that the fact that there may be

2

a basis to -- to stop a number of -- of motorists is not

3

-- is not relevant.

4

example, this Court's decision in Whren indicates that so

5

long as there is probable cause for arrest, the reason for

6

the -­

7

And in part, I believe that, for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that was for an -- an

8

arrest in which, so far as we can tell, the -- the stated

9

grounds for the arrest were those for which there was

10

probable cause.

11

And I think one of the concerns underlying the

12

argument that I asked you to comment on is that if the -­

13

if the police, in effect, have -- have discretion ad lib

14

afterwards to come up with new grounds for the arrest,

15

there's -- there's going to be a kind of a basic corrosion

16

in the integrity of the arrest process and in the

17

confidence of people to believe that the police are really

18

acting in good faith when they make an arrest.

19

MS. HART:

Well, Your Honor, the -- if there is

20

probable cause for arrest, that is the concern of the

21

Fourth Amendment, and I -- I don't believe that the -- the

22

concern -- I don't know that there's any empirical

23

evidence that the concern that you are expressing has been

24

borne out.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That -- that may be -- that may

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

be the -- the best response.

2

know, there -- there are no studies that have gone into

3

this on an empirical basis.

4

you know?

5

MS. HART:

And I take it, so far as you

Is that correct, so far as

Not as -- as far as I know, Your

6

Honor.

7

that an officer would effect an arrest without any basis

8

for the arrest on a hope that a prosecuting attorney can

9

come up with a basis for the arrest -­

10

But I would also suggest to you that the notion

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

The -- the argument is

11

that he thinks he does have a ground.

12

he's wrong.

Unless he is very unimaginative, he'll find

13

another one.

It's not that he arrests saying I have no

14

basis to arrest this person, but I'll think of something

15

later.

16

the argument, I think, is directed to a case like this.

17

It turns out that

It's -- it's the -- the problem is, I think -- or

MS. HART:

Well, and -- and Your Honor, I -- I

18

do believe that the concern of the Fourth Amendment, which

19

is the only constitutional provision at issue in this

20

case, is that there in fact be a reasonable basis for

21

arrest and that subsequently or promptly subsequently or

22

prior to arrest be tested by a neutral magistrate.

23

that's the only concern.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Ms. Hart, I'm -- I'm not sure

what you mean by -- that there has to be probable cause

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

for arrest.

2

the basis of the facts known to the arresting officer?

3

mean, let's -- let's assume an officer stops a car for a

4

broken taillight, and it turns out the car doesn't have a

5

broken taillight.

6

However, the car also has an expired inspection sticker,

7

which the officer didn't know about.

8

cause for arrest, as you're using the term here?

9

Do you mean objectively, or do you mean on

All right?

MS. HART:

So that basis is wrong.

Was there a probable

If there was probable cause based on

10

the -- if there was reason based on the objective facts

11

and circumstances -­

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it doesn't matter whether

he knew those facts and circumstances.

14
15

I

MS. HART:

-- that -- known to the officer at

arrest.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. HART:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, so it has to be known.

Yes.
So in my example, the arrest

19

would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he

20

didn't know about the sticker.

21

MS. HART:

Absent the circumstances at arrest

22

giving rise to a reasonable basis to believe that a crime

23

had been committed, there would not be probable cause.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're saying it's the facts

known to the officer -­

MS. HART:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Precisely.
-- that have to establish the

probable --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's --

Once -- once you establish that

6

limitation, are you willing to accept the horrible that -­

7

that Justice Souter proposed to you?

8

indeed, so easy to -- to gin up some other cause for

9

arrest when you used a mistaken cause?

10

it's all that easy.

11

MS. HART:

Is it -- is it,

I don't know that

It is not and -- and -- it is not.

12

And that was the -- the reason why I indicated in response

13

to Justice Souter's question that I do believe that it is

14

not all that easy.

15

foremost commentators in this area has termed that notion

16

fanciful for the reason that it is -- it is stopping on a

17

hope and a prayer that something will provide

18

justification for that later -­

19
20

And I -- I believe that one of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was LaFave.

You cited

LaFave in your brief for that proposition.

21

MS. HART:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you made the point, in

23

answer to Justice O'Connor, that a police officer in

24

Washington is not required to divulge on the spot the

25

reason for the arrest.

What is the point at which the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

arrestee under Washington law is entitled to know the

2

cause of the arrest?

3

MS. HART:

At charging, Your Honor, there -­

4

there -- the -- the individual who has been arrested, as a

5

matter of the Sixth Amendment, would be entitled to know

6

the charges against him or her, and the officer is

7

required, in a warrantless arrest, to appear before a

8

neutral magistrate and have the probable cause for the

9

arrest tested -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it -- is it at the

11

arraignment or the -- at the earlier booking in the police

12

station?

13
14
15

MS. HART:

I'm sorry.

I'm not following your

question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it -- is it -- is the time

16

when the arrestee must told you are being arrested for X

17

reason, is that when the arrestee appears before the

18

magistrate or is it earlier when he's brought into the

19

police station and he's booked?

20

which point?

21

MS. HART:

The arrest is booked.

Neither, Justice Ginsburg.

At

The

22

arrestee would be entitled constitutionally to know the

23

charge against him or her when criminal -- a criminal

24

prosecution is commenced by charging.

25

that is done in Washington by an information or a charge

For the most part,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

filed by a prosecuting attorney.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You mean he could be held

3

until a charge is filed without being told why he's being

4

held?

5

MS. HART:

Justice Stevens -­

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

MS. HART:

So that could be a week or 2.

But it would be -- he would be held

8

in that case following a determination by a neutral

9

magistrate that there are grounds to hold him.

10

that point --

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Would the magistrate keep those

grounds secret?

13
14

And at

MS. HART:

They would not be secret, Your Honor,

no.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wouldn't the magistrate

16

tell him why he's being held?

17

MS. HART:

The magistrate would tell the -- the

18

arrestee why he's being held, provided the arrestee is

19

present for that particular procedure.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And how soon is he entitled to

21

appear before the magistrate?

22

MS. HART:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm sorry?
How soon after his physical

24

arrest does he have a right to appear before the

25

magistrate?

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. HART:

My -- my recollection under

2

Washington's law would be -- 72 hours is the time for the

3

charge.

4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So for 72 hours, he could be

held incommunicado without knowing why he was arrested.

6

MS. HART:

But -- but for that period, the

7

arresting officer would have had to -- during the 48-hour

8

period at the outset, that this Court discussed in

9

Riverside, the probable cause for the arrest would be

10

tested by a neutral magistrate.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You also said that you

12

thought this case is distinguishable on the legitimacy of

13

taping the conversation with the police officer on the

14

highway.

15

from the Washington Intermediate Appellate Court decision

16

that the -- that the -- that Alford wanted to show to the

17

police officer?

18

Why -- why do you think this is distinguishable

MS. HART:

Well, first of all, again, Justice

19

Ginsburg, the Privacy Act issue is not one that we have

20

raised before this Court.

21

would suggest it is distinguishable is that in a

22

subsequent case considered by the Washington State Supreme

23

Court called State v. Clark, the court look at Flora, the

24

Intermediate Appellate Court case, and -- and termed it as

25

a case that said you do not have a private conversation

But -- but the reason that I

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

when it is open to passers-by.

And in Flora, there was

2

another individual present at the scene and who was, in

3

fact, subsequently arrested for interfering with the

4

arrest in the Flora case.

5

suggesting, at least some grounds for distinguishing the

6

Flora case for that reason.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there is, all I'm

Do you know if there's been

8

any instruction in the State of Washington to police

9

following that Flora decision about taping -- about

10

arresting people for taping conversations with police

11

officers?

12

MS. HART:

I do believe there has, Your Honor.

13

It's not a matter of record, however, in the -- against

14

arresting for that reason.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The flashing headlights which

16

was -- there was a citation.

17

tape recording and a citation for the flashing headlights.

18

Could there have been a -- an arrest for the flashing

19

headlights, or is that a lesser category of offense that's

20

not an arrestable offense?

21

MS. HART:

There was an arrest for the

Under Washington law, the flashing

22

headlights, the wig-wag lights, in and of themselves would

23

not be an arrestable offense.

24

offense.

25

would be arrestable, and the wig-wag headlights would play

a part in that, however.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he was never -- never

3

charged with the impersonating an officer, only with the

4

flashing headlights.

Is that right?

5

MS. HART:

That's correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the case, as far as I'm

thinking of it at the moment, comes down to everybody is

agreeing -- well, no.

want to reserve that probably.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. COMEY

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

14

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

15
16
17

MR. COMEY:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The validity of a police action under the Fourth

18

Amendment turns upon an objective assessment of the facts

19

viewed through the prism -­

20
21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do the facts, on your view,

have to be known to the officer?

22

MR. COMEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is -- is there -- and correct

24

me if I'm wrong.

In -- in cases in which we're inquiring

25

into probable cause for a warrantless search, we give the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

government credit for any fact known to any officer, don't

2

we?

3

MR. COMEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why wouldn't we have the same

5

rule?

6

facts known to any officer when one officer makes an

7

arrest?

8
9
10

Why shouldn't we have the same rule with respect to

MR. COMEY:

I suspect, Your Honor, that the

Government would urge such a rule if it were at issue in
case.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. COMEY:

But it's not urging it here.

Well, I don't see it at -- at issue

13

in this case, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't think it is.

15

want to know where we're going.

16

MR. COMEY:

17
18

I just

That's -- that's correct, Your

Honor.
The -- the Government's position, as with the

19

State of Washington's position, is that the -- the

20

analysis is simply did the facts known to the officer,

21

viewed through the prism of an objectively reasonable

22

officer, establish probable cause.

23

evaluation of the arrest turn upon the officer's

24

subjective assessment of those facts -- in other words,

25

the working of his brain, the crunching of those facts

And that to make an

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that results in the spitting out of a legal conclusion -­

2

is contrary to this Court's precedent and guts the

3

objective reasonable test, and would make, instead, the

4

validity of a Fourth Amendment action turn upon whether

5

the officer is particularly smart, whether he's new,

6

whether he's nervous, whether he says nothing at all or

7

whether he decides to say, you're under arrest for

8

everything listed in the Washington code book.

9

those circumstances, the results would be different.

10

Under

The -- the concern that Your Honor raised about

11

police officers engaging in a post hoc rationalization I

12

respectfully suggest is not a concern that is rooted in

13

reality because the facts continue to drive the analysis.

irrelevant, that that's for courts to do.

And that is utterly inconsistent with this

Court's precedent and would, in fact, gut the objective

12

The Ninth Circuit's rule would lead to

13

dramatically uneven law enforcement.

It would, indeed,

14

lead to either stacking or silence, and there's plenty of

15

good reason why an officer or a Federal agent, who are not

16

required to say anything at arrest, might want to inform a

17

defendant of a basis for his arrest and might want to

18

uphold other bases for an arrest, to protect a witness,

for example.

demonstrates the unworkability of this test because there

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Justice Stevens, may it please

In essence, the closely related offense doctrine

from arresting someone for non-criminal conduct.

10

for conduct that was not -­

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

At its

Mr. Alford was arrested

Well, I thought at its core

12

it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted

13

about closely related offenses.

14

that's what we were concerned with.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought at its core

Well, Your Honor, the closely

16

related offense doctrine itself is -- it's in five

17

circuits -- six depending on how you count the cases.

18

it's designed to -- to look at two things:

19

whether the arrest itself is reasonable; and number two,

20

from a qualified immunity standpoint, whether -­

21

essentially it's a no harm/no foul rule.

22

for which the person was arrested is criminal, but the

23

officer merely has a mistake in terminology -- he calls it

24

driving while license suspended instead of reckless

25

driving -- then it actually salvages the arrest for law

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what if the arresting

officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just

makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day,

that indeed there were objective facts that would have

justified an arrest.

7

mind but he didn't say anything.

8
9

It wasn't what the officer had in

MR. PHILLIPS:

What result then?

Your Honor, that -- that

implicates several other rights.

Number one, it is -­

10

while an officer could, in some jurisdictions, effectuate

11

a warrantless arrest without stating a basis therefor -­

12
13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, could -- could an

arrest made under the circumstances I described be valid?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I hate to say this, Your Honor,

15

but it depends because at some point, for example, when

16

the person is brought before the magistrate for the

17

probable cause determination, they're not operating in a

18

vacuum.

There will have to be -­

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

No.

At that time, there

20

does.

But we're talking about at the time of arrest.

And

21

it -- it just -- if the closely related offense doctrine

22

has the effect of punishing an officer for explaining to

23

the suspect a reason for the arrest, why is that a good

24

doctrine?

25

could end up, at the end of the day, having a valid

I mean, if the officer could say nothing and

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

arrest, I just think the closely related doctrine doesn't

2

serve a very good purpose.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, the -- in this case,

4

of course, that's -- that's not the -- that's not this

5

case because the officer was very clear.

6

what it was for, and then he -- when he booked him,

7

Officer Haner even booked him for illegal recording.

8

in this case, we're -- we're not presented with a vacuum.

9

He said exactly

So

But even in an instance where the officer did

10

not state at the instant of the arrest why he was

11

arresting the person, one of the benefits of this doctrine

12

is that it would allow for an objective review of the

13

facts in order to determine -­

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, if the objective review

15

shows that there were, indeed, facts that would have

16

justified an arrest, then what's wrong with allowing that

17

to proceed?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, the -- the danger of

19

that is that allowing this, as -- as I termed it, a

20

general right of arrest with -- with no articulated basis

21

at any point up until charging runs contrary to some of

22

the basic principles -­

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

What's -- what's

24

happening here is in order to avoid the down side of your

25

test -- as Justice O'Connor puts it, her point is that if

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

we adopt your rule, there's going to be an incentive not

2

to state the reason.

3

haven't really squarely confronted it -- I think you're

4

suggesting that there has to be an additional rule that

5

the police officer must say why he's arrested, and -- and

6

the authorities just don't establish that.

7

want us to go on and make up that rule, I suppose we could

8

make up that rule.

9

Now, in order to avoid that -- you

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Now, if you

I'll be very happy if you -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I'm -- I'm sure you'd be

11

delighted.

12

And if the choice is between making up a new rule to make

13

your test work or rejecting your test, it seems to me that

14

the -- that the latter might be the preferred course.

15

But that's not the case we're confronted with.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Your Honor, to sort of

16

piggyback on what Justice Souter and what Justice Ginsburg

17

had commented on, there's no empirical evidence to suggest

18

that there is or would be a movement by police officers

19

towards silence.

20

says that police officers have in the past in the six

21

jurisdictions, the six circuits that use this.

22

evidence that they have remained silent in an effort to -­

23

There is simply nothing out there that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's no

If you say

nothing, any -- any basis that you could have had for the

mention something, you better be able to substantiate that

particular cause or a closely related crime.

5

officers aren't any dumber than the rest of us.

6

believe that -- that that wouldn't be the -- the

7

consequence of -- of the rule you're asking us to adopt.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whereas, if you -- if you

Police
I can't

Your Honor -­
To put it this way, it seems to

10

me the burden should be on you to -- to tell us why a

11

police -- police officers are so stupid that they -- that

12

they go around and -- and continue to give reasons when

13

that's -- when that's going to make it more difficult for

14

them to sustain the arrest and subject them to -- to

15

personal liability.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, for the most part, Justice

17

Scalia, it does not come back to haunt the officers

18

because the vast majority of arrests are lawful.

19

majority of officers have probable cause for the thing

20

that they arrest the person for, and they arrest him for

21

criminal conduct.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The vast

But if they're told in this

23

case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their

24

own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they

25

would pursue the safe course and say nothing.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

I mean, you did say at one point in your brief

must inform the arrestee of the officer's authority and

the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to state

11

the cause of the arrest, or are you?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Personally, Your Honor, I think

13

that that would -- that would certainly comport more with

14

the common law that was extant at the time the

15

Constitution was -­

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, regardless if it -­

17

whether it comports with the common law, I don't see why

18

the rule that you are urging, closely related, is going to

19

make a dime's worth of difference unless ultimately we

20

hold that there is an obligation to state the cause at the

21

time of the arrest.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because, Your Honor, even if the

23

-- even if the cause of the arrest is not stated at the

24

time of the arrest, the person must be booked for

25

something.

There's a -- a report that's generated.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

The booking occurs after

arrest, and I thought what we were concerned with in this

4

case was the validity of the arrest, not the booking.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Correct, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Now, if -- if the -- if

7

the -- if it is the validity of arrest, which -- which is

8

in issue, I don't see why your rule is going to make any

9

difference in the long run unless we go the further step

10

and say, in order to make this work, i.e., enforce Fourth

11

Amendment values, at the time of the arrest the cause has

12

got to be stated.

13

Am -- am I missing something?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Your Honor, I would

14

analogize it to the -- the arrest rule.

Whether someone

is or is not under arrest from a Fourth Amendment

standpoint is based on an objective test, and it is viewed

after the fact.

been arrested, and the -- and the mere fact that the

18

police officer gave the wrong reason for arresting him

19

doesn't make me feel very bad about the arrest at all.

20

I'm glad he was arrested.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm going to disagree on two

22

points.

First, at the trial court, the State did not

23

argue that he could have been arrested for other crimes.

24

The jury was never instructed on the elements of these

25

supposed other crimes.

And we pointed that out in the

34
Alderson Reporting Company

appeal in the reply brief.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

Yes, but did you object to the

instructions in the trial court?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor, because the -­

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

One of the problems I have

6

with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already

7

ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue

8

carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not

9

objected to by your client.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

11

the only instructions that were given regarding -­

12

regarding what they needed to find to find a violation

13

were the Privacy Act instructions.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

But whose fault is that?

Well, Your Honor, I think if the

16

State wanted them to -- qualified immunity is an

17

affirmative defense.

18

if they wanted the jury to find there was impersonation,

19

they should have requested an instruction on that because

20

impersonation in Washington requires more than simply

21

taking an action that creates an impression that you're an

22

officer.

23

specific intent to defraud someone, and here the only

24

thing he did, he gave them a flashlight and helped them

25

jack up their car.

If they wanted the State to find -­

It also -- under first degree, there has to be

On the issue of the wig-wag headlights, the

2

transcript shows that the officer spent a minute or 2, by

3

his own estimation, on the scene behind Mr. Alford's car,

4

saw no wig-wag headlights.

5

And as for the scanner, the -- the transcript,

6

page 246 -- he admitted at trial it was actually a ham

7

radio, not a portable police scanner.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

But I thought that the reason

that the police went after your client after he left the

10

vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that

11

point suspected that he might be impersonating a police

12

officer.

13

15

and wasn't the original following of your client triggered

16

by the suspicion that he might be impersonating a police

17

officer?

18

That's what the people in the -- the disabled
They said he had flashing

We thought he was a police officer.

MR. PHILLIPS:

And -­

Yes, Your Honor, and that -- that

19

-- we have not argued that there was not suspicion

20

sufficient to -- to have a stop to do investigation.

21

However, under the Washington statute, there was not

22

evidence sufficient to show probable cause that there was

23

an actual crime -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under Washington law, is it

It is a traffic

That is a non-arrestable offense, and that was

guilty of any offense at all?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor.

Even the traffic

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it's unlawful to have wig­

wag lights, and I take it it's an arrestable offense to

11

impersonate a police officer.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor, but that -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that would -- that would

14

certainly be probable cause to arrest just based on the

15

wig-wag, plus the fact he lied to the police in -- in

16

instructing them the button to push or didn't tell them

17

what button to push to make them go.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor.

The obstruction

20

interpreting the statute, there has to not only be the -­

of them pushed.

in fact if -- one of them actually said at trial that he

didn't ask him to push the button because he wanted to see

whether he would push it or not.

there's no facts to support a finding of probable cause

even on the obstruction because the officers were

essentially just letting him hang himself.

He showed them the manual.

They both say that they

However, there's obviously no obstruction

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there's no -- again,

Well, that -- that isn't the

11

issue before us here.

12

the question on which we granted certiorari, we have to

13

assume, or else the whole thing doesn't make any sense and

14

it's all -- it's all arguing about nothing -- we have to

15

assume that there was probable cause on some other ground

16

than the ground which he stated or anything closely

17

related to the ground which -- which the officer stated.

18

Isn't that -- isn't that the -- the manner in which this

19

case gets to us?

20

I -- I assume that for purposes of

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, we raised the issue

21

at the Ninth Circuit that there had been no evidence put

22

forward on the other crimes.

23

the deputy prosecuting attorney -- and in fact, even in

24

closing argument, when they addressed the -- the wig-wag

25

headlights, et cetera, they stated specifically that that

And we pointed out that even

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

information went to what they called his intent to

2

unlawfully record.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but that's not the

4

ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it.

5

Circuit never had to reach the question of whether there

6

was probable cause on these other grounds -­

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10
11

The Ninth

Correct, Your Honor.
-- because it found, even if

there was these other grounds, they're not closely related
to the illegal taping.
So I suppose you're telling us that if we find

12

that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's

13

not part of -- of United States constitutional law, what

14

we should do is remand to the Ninth Circuit so that they

15

could determine whether there was probable cause on the

16

other grounds.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

18

And in -- in looking at this -- this probable

19

cause determination and the reasonableness requirement of

20

the Fourth Amendment, the qualified immunity, of course,

21

was a doctrine that was advanced by the Court to address

22

specific problems.

23

any way by the closely related offense, this subset of

24

qualified immunity cases.

25

None of those problems are impacted in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask one other question

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

about the proceedings in the trial court?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, sir.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was there a motion for summary

4

judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law,

5

they should be entitled to qualified -­

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, sir.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that was overruled.

That was denied, yes.
And then there was a jury

10

trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said

11

there -- there was basis for qualified immunity.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Stevens.

And

13

the -- in reviewing the transcript and in reviewing the -­

14

the instructions and the ruling on the summary judgment

15

motion, the reason that Senior Judge Bryan did not rule on

16

the qualified immunity was twofold.

17

One, at the time of the summary judgment motion,

18

one of the officers was -- well, was lying about having

19

contacted the prosecutor prior to making the arrest, and

20

he noted in his order that there was a factual dispute.

21

So summary judgment wasn't appropriate.

22

And second, Judge Bryan indicated that

23

essentially there was a problem created by the Saucier

24

opinion because he felt that it was somehow possible that

25

there could have been an arrest effectuated without

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

probable cause, but that there was a reasonable mistake on

2

the part of the officers.

3

jury on the -- on this closely related offense doctrine.

4

It didn't proceed on there were these other crimes for

5

which probable cause existed, but on this broad standard

6

of good faith and reasonable mistake.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

So this did not proceed to the

What is your understanding of

the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I almost hate to say it, Your

10

Honor, but I believe it was a lack of sympathy.

11

that is my -- much like with Justice Scalia, I believe

12

they -- they looked at the -- the circumstances and even

13

though there was not probable cause to have arrested him,

14

they came to the conclusion we don't like Mr. Alford.

15

We're not going to find for him.

16
17

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That -­

May I ask one other question

then too?
JUSTICE SCALIA:
even know the man.

That's not my reason.

I don't

I'm just -­

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In -- in your view is the

22

closely related doctrine a -- a matter of closely related

23

as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it

24

a matter of -- are the facts relevant?

25

one argue that these offenses were factually related

For example, could

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

pretty closely because they grew out of the same central

2

group of facts?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

In our brief, Your Honor, I often

4

used the phrase same conduct test because in amalgamating

5

the six different circuits, that appeared to be the most

6

consistent test and the one that's most consistent with

7

the objective standard and with the reasonableness

8

standard, that if -- and I, again, go to the no harm/no

9

foul.

If you're engaging in conduct that would have and

10

should have led to your arrest, if it's the same conduct

11

for which you were arrested and it's simply misnamed, then

12

there essentially is no harm of constitutional magnitude.

13

But otherwise --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then you have a very

15

narrow view of closely related.

16

cases.

17

the DA, although after they arrested him -- didn't they

18

describe the whole episode from when they saw Alford pull

19

up behind the disabled vehicle?

20

they mentioned the flashing lights.

21

whole episode up till the point where they -- the officers

22

apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed -­

23

they told the DA everything, and he said, yes, you have

24

probable cause.

25

It comes down to misnomer

It's one thing to say -- what the officers told

MR. PHILLIPS:

They described that and
They described the

They did describe the entire

episode to him, Justice Ginsburg.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why couldn't it be related

in time and space rather than legally related?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm not urging something as

5

narrow as -- as a semi-Blockburger test.

But here you

6

have essentially two discrete conducts that were being

7

examined by the officers:

8

surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions

9

surrounding the taping.

number one, the actions

And the trial -- I mean, it was

very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents

14

that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause

15

for the arrest.

Mr. Alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape

At the moment Devenpeck saw the tape

19

So when looking at whether something is -- is

20

sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to

21

have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but

22

objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete

23

incidents for the analysis.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why is it exactly that a

policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a

2

punch?

Now, the policeman might make a mistake about

3

that.

He -- he thought he threw a punch, but he made a

4

mistake.

5

make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what

6

crime to label it?

7

Now -- now, why is a policeman less likely to

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Your Honor, we're not

8

concerned so much -- this doctrine is not concerned so

9

much with what to label the crime.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

You said -- you -- you

11

say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman

12

had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for

13

A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some

14

circumstances in which that's okay.

15

it's -- as long as -- it was always okay, really, as long

16

as objectively there was reasonable cause.

17

you're going to add a little thing.

18

and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he

19

looked at was in fact illegal.

20

policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're

21

not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch.

22

just wondered why not.

23

throwing the punch.

24

so -- that -- that supposedly in your view is some

25

terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it,

And on their view,

On your view,

You're going to add,

So you say -- because

So I

puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I'm just

Well, Your Honor, the distinction

4

in -- in this particular case and the distinctions in the

5

-- in the cases that run the gamut around the circuits

6

generally show one thing that we --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that the circuits all agree

8

with you.

Now, my only problem is it's hard for me to see

9

why they all agree with you.

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

And -- and that's where I'm

sort of stuck.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, if we start with

14

first principles, and the first principle that underlies

15

this case is there is, from the framing area -- era, a

16

general mistrust of warrantless arrests.

17

step to the reasonableness clause.

18

reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially

19

created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith

20

analysis.

21

further away from the original principle.

From that, we

there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a

Yes, but Mr. Phillips, let me
You are complaining about an

arrest which you admit was valid.

Yes.

Certainly not.
Oh, I misunderstood.

I

thought we were just talking about qualified immunity.
But you challenge the arrest itself even though
you admit there was probable cause for the arrest?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor, because we don't

feel that there was probable cause for the arrest.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't that challenge that

23

here, though.

I asked you that question earlier, and I

24

thought you agreed that for purposes of our deciding this

25

case, we -- we will assume, though you do not concede the

46
Alderson Reporting Company

point, that there was probable cause on one of the other

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly, exactly.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and there's no need for

the Ninth Circuit's rule unless there was probable cause

because if there was no probable cause, you win on that

ground.

You don't have to get into this closely related

offense doctrine.

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that is correct, Your

Honor, and that was -JUSTICE STEVENS:

This -- this doctrine only

comes into play and is only required in cases involving a

22

valid arrest and a -- a mistake by the officer in

identifying the wrong cause for the arrest.

extension of the qualified -- it's a -- it's a -- an

application of the qualified immunity doctrine to say you

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because it actually -- to

3

turn it back around, you're not protected because you did

4

not act lawfully.

5

You did not act lawfully because -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but if you say the arrest

6

was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize

7

the reason why he did.

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, the cases that have

examined this doctrine have -- have looked at it as sort

10

of straddling the Fourth Amendment and the qualified

11

immunity analysis.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but don't you reconcile

13

the -- the problem of the straddle by saying that unless

14

the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a

15

closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid?

16

Isn't that your position?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Correct.

Unreasonable.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

Now, let me ask you -- you one other question.

Okay.

20

You -- you started out in getting down to first principles

21

with disfavor of warrantless arrests.

22

be different if the officer had somehow gotten an arrest

23

warrant on the spot for illegal taping?

24

making the same argument?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Would your position

Wouldn't you be

Certainly, Your Honor, and there

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

we would --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests.

4
5

So it has nothing to do,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in this case it does, but

had there been a warrant -­

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, in this -- yes, but on

7

your theory, that is -- that is incidental.

8

essential.

9

taping, you'd be making the same argument.

10
11

That is not

If he had had an arrest warrant for illegal

MR. PHILLIPS:

That there was no probable cause

for the arrest.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that's right.

Correct, Your Honor.
Yes.

And I think that that -- of

16

course, that -- as we point out in our brief, there's

17

support for that, that historically the warrant must show

18

the reason that someone is being arrested.

19

pointed out, there's this -- an odd -­

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, you don't have any case

21

law to cite to us for that.

That gets us into a whole new

22

doctrine.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

So as we

Well, Your Honor, I think one of

24

the most fundamental principles that we can look at on

25

showing the reason why you're being arrested is the great

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

writ of habeas corpus where, in order to hold someone,

2

they must show why he is being held.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you've already conceded

4

that it -- Washington law doesn't require the officer on

5

the spot to say why he's making the arrest and that

6

there's no decision of this Court or any court that I know

7

that said the Constitution requires the officer on the

8

spot to give a reason.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So

10

what we have posited and what the Ninth Circuit -- what

11

they did in the Gasho case, for example, is after the fact

12

you can look at the actions that were taken by the

13

officers, the booking sheet, et cetera, to give you some

14

objectively verifiable evidence of the cause for the

15

arrest.

16

be a nexus between conduct and arrest, and -­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN A. HART

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

MS. HART:

I think I'd only like to make one

22

point, Your Honors, and that is that the Fourth Amendment

23

does not make the validity of arrest a game that the

24

government loses even when there's probable cause for

25

arrest, but the closely related offense doctrine does.

50
Alderson Reporting Company
