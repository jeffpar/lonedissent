Mr. Layton.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. LAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Though bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the

11

Missouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its

12

rationale.

13

Stanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a

14

determination as to the precise minimum age for capital

15

punishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and

16

leaving to jurors responsibility for determining the

17

culpability of individual defendants above that minimum

18

age.

This Court should stay the course it set in

19

The Missouri court justified its departure from

20

Stanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached

21

is quite different from the result in Stanford.

22

-- excuse me -- in Atkins.

23

addressing mental ability, itself a component of

24

culpability.

25

that characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded

In that

In that case, the Court was

The Court announced a principle based on

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

are not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it

2

left to the States the determination of the standard and

3

the means of implementing that principle.

4

The Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped

5

beyond the question of maturity, which is an element of

6

culpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age.

7

It drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily

8

over-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional

9

status, thus depriving legislators and juries of the

10

ability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we didn't leave it up to

12

the States entirely.

I mean, you -- you mean the States

13

could adopt any definition of mental retardation they

14

want?

15

MR. LAYTON:

No.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

minimal level of mental retardation.

18

MR. LAYTON:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The States certainly -­
So there's -- there's some
Right?

There is some minimal level.
And isn't that necessarily

20

over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is

21

necessarily over-inclusive?

22

MR. LAYTON:

No.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely there will be some

24

people who -- who, although they have that level of mental

25

retardation, with regard to the particular crime in

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

question, are deserving of the death penalty.
MR. LAYTON:

I -- I don't agree that it would be

3

over-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins.

4

Court said that someone who has that level of mental

5

retardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by

6

definition.

7

are 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who

8

are 18, 20, 25, or some other age.

9

That certainly would not be true here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

There

But the age 18 is set even

10

for such things as buying tobacco.

11

line between people who are members of the community, the

12

adult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on

13

juries, to serve in the military.

14

someone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not

15

eligible to be an adult member of the community?

16

MR. LAYTON:

The -- the dividing

Why should it be that

I think that legislators would be

17

surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they

18

were affecting their criminal law.

19

statutes have individualized determinations, the military

20

being one of them.

21

individualized determination, albeit by parents, not the

22

Government.

23

That -- the other kinds of examples that you cite, for

24

example, tobacco -­

25

In fact, many of those

17-year-olds can enlist.

There is an

17-year-olds may be serving in Iraq today.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But with parental -- they are

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

wards of their parents.

2

MR. LAYTON:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

thing with marriage.

5

without parental consent.

6

MR. LAYTON:

So their parents -- the same

A 17-year-old can marry but not

Although in most instances can

7

marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are

8

sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized

9

determination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does

10

not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital

11

punishment.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why pick -- why pick on the

13

death penalty?

14

somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes,

15

why -- why just pick on the death penalty?

16

say they're immune from any criminal penalty?

17

I mean, if you're going to say that

MR. LAYTON:

Why -- why not

Well, I -- I must assume that if we

18

-- if the Court says they are immune from the -- from

19

capital punishment that someone will come and say they

20

also must be immune from, for example, life without

21

parole.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

would follow.

24

line.

25

I'm sure that -- I'm sure that

I -- I don't see where there's a logical

MR. LAYTON:

No.

The -- the problem with

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

adopting the -- the 18-year-old line is that it is

2

essentially arbitrary.

3

legislators and not courts adopt.

4
5
6

It's the kind of line that

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But didn't -- didn't

we adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?
MR. LAYTON:

In -- in Thompson, the Court in a

7

4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old -- a 15-year-old

8

execution, and the States have taken, including Missouri

9

through its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that

10

there is a 16-year-old line.

11

it's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard

12

to the 16-year-old line, not because it has some

13

biological or psychological magic, but because perhaps --

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And today, in fact, I think

Well, but -- but there was -­

15

it's about the same consensus that existed in the

16

retardation case.

17

MR. LAYTON:

18

look at the -- the --

19

Absolutely, that's true.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

If you

And -- and so are we somehow

20

required to at least look at that?

21

of how many States have approved 18 years as the line is

22

about the same as those in the retardation case.

23

MR. LAYTON:

I mean, the statistics

The -- the Court has kind of three

24

groups of cases with regard to the number of States.

On

25

one extreme, are Enmund and Coker where you have three and

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

eight States.

2

Stanford where you have 24 and 34 States.

3

there's this middle group, which isn't just Atkins and

4

this case.

5

the same number.

6

On the other extreme, are Penry and
And then

It's also Tison, which is also almost exactly

The Court in Atkins had to find a way of

7

distinguishing Tison, to the extent the Court relied on

8

that -- that counting process, and the -- the Court

9

concluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with

10

regard to the mentally retarded.

11

of trend here.

12

We don't have that kind

In -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we -- we have a different

13

kind of trend.

14

consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the

15

last, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual

16

imposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose

17

crimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been

18

dropping.

19

year, I -- I think the figures were that there were two.

20

The -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as

21

the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been

22

occurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime

23

seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all.

24

what are we supposed to make of that?

25

What do you make -- you spoke of a

I think 10 years ago, there were 13.

MR. LAYTON:

Last

What -­

Well, two things.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Number one is that capital sentences have been

2

dropping for all ages, not just for those under 18.

3

-- you have to take that into account.

4

The second is that although the last -­

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

Has -- has the -- has the rate

of attrition been the same?

7

MR. LAYTON:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. LAYTON:

10

So it

It is -13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.

It is not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't think we've seen that,

11

or maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition

12

generally.

13

Is that so?

MR. LAYTON:

It is certainly greater, but part

14

of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers

15

for the -- the juveniles, those under 18, that the

16

difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how

17

the numbers come out.

18

But if you look over the last 10 years, in fact,

19

it has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend,

20

but the down trend -­

21
22
23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it went up once I think,

didn't it?
MR. LAYTON:

It -- it went up once within -­

24

since -- since Stanford and then came back down.

Now,

25

whether this -- this period in which it comes back down is

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

going to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to

2

where we were 10 years ago I don't know.

3

hypothetical to suggest that -- that this very recent

4

trend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10

5

years.

6

That's entirely

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so you're basically -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're -- you're basically

7
8
9
10

saying that the -- the time is too short, the numbers are
too small -­

11

MR. LAYTON:

Right.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. LAYTON:

-- to infer anything.

Right, and the time is too short on

14

the legislative side as well.

the States that have adopted new legislation having done

16

so, one of them in 1999 and the others simply in 2002 and

2004.

punishment in the United States, there are many times when

19

States have abolished capital punishment and then

20

returned.

We're only talking about

If we were to look at the history of -- of capital

And Justice -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you were in the midst

22

of telling us why the -- there is a consensus now that

23

it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I -- I

24

-- you weren't -­

25

MR. LAYTON:

No.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
answer.

3

You couldn't finish that

I want to know it.
MR. LAYTON:

Since -- since Stanford, we have

4

had no executions under 16 even though it is possible to

5

read Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a

6

State to adopt a statute that specifically says 15.

7

one has tried that.

8

and Stanford together to mean there is a 16-year-old line.

9

Two States have adopted 16 by statute.

10

No

Everyone seems to have taken Thompson

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and so you say there's

11

-- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding

12

of what that decision means.

13

MR. LAYTON:

I -- I think that that's right.

14

There are States that have adopted it specifically and

15

others have simply implemented it.

16

today, I -- it's hard to imagine that I would -- even in a

17

State where I could find a statute saying I could

18

prosecute someone under age 16, that I would try such a

19

thing.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If I were a prosecutor

Let -- let me ask you this.

21

-- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full

22

closing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the

23

portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary?

24

adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?

25

MR. LAYTON:

I

Can

I -- I don't know how it could be

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. LAYTON:

No.

I don't have the

What -- what he's facing is -­

is 18 pages of transcript that occupied the -- the defense

10

counsel's argument.

Of those 18 pages, 4 pages are

11

dedicated purely to Mr. Simmons' youth, and throughout the

12

rest of the argument, he uses terms to reinforce that.

13

refers to him repeatedly as a 17-year-old.

14

15

very young.

He does things to reinforce with the jury that he's

So then we come back and in a few pages of

17

rebuttal, we have a couple of words -- I shouldn't say

18

that -- two sentences in which the prosecutor is trying to

19

respond to that particular lengthy theme and argument.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

the words in question were:

22

old.

23

Mitigating?

24

contrary.

25

Isn't that scary?

It was pretty clear.

Alderson Reporting Company

Blackstone would be relevant because that was the law from

the Constitution.

were looking at English practices, and would they have

Oh, I -- I think Mr. Jefferson

thought that.

they were leading the world, and I have no objection to us

leading the world, but Mr. Jefferson's lead of the world

MR. LAYTON:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

(Laughter.)

5

MR. LAYTON:
recently.

I read a biography of John Adams

I recall that he didn't think highly of them.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. LAYTON:

9

What did John Adams think of

the French?

4

6

That -- that may well be.

The -- Missouri, in order to

implement the principle that those who are immature should

10

not be subject to capital punishment, has adopted an

11

approach that, first off, excludes anyone age 16 and under

12

from capital punishment; second, requires certification by

13

the juvenile court for anyone who is 16, but otherwise

14

turns the matter over to the jury and defines it as a

15

statutory mitigator.

16

The kind of evidence that is discussed in Mr.

17

Simmons' brief at some length could have been applied -­

18

could have been presented during the penalty phase of Mr.

19

Simmons' trial.

20

this Court as far back as Eddings where there was evidence

21

of mental and emotional development.

22

evidence of mental age and social maturity.

23

the post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Simmons presented such

24

evidence regarding his impulsivity, his susceptibility to

25

peer pressure, and his immaturity.

It has been reflected in decisions of

In Penry, there was
And here, in

But he didn't present

Alderson Reporting Company

that at trial.

2

to do that and he chose not to.

3

There is a mechanism in Missouri for him

JUSTICE BREYER:

Before you go off on this, the

4

one statistic that interested me -- and I'd like you to

5

discuss its relevance really -- is if we look back 10

6

years, I have only three States executing a juvenile:

7

Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.

8

MR. LAYTON:

Correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And those three States account

10

for about 11 percent of the population of the country,

11

11.3 percent.

12

Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford,

13

we get three others in there:

14

and Missouri, 1.

15

MR. LAYTON:

Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1;

And if you go to the convictions

16

rather than the executions, then Alabama goes into that

17

mix.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

We have a very different

number.

20

MR. LAYTON:

Right.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the reason that I thought

22

arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is

23

there are a lot of States.

24

for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were

25

several States that on the books permitted the death

Say, New Hampshire, I think,

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed.

2

and that's true across the country.

3

States like that.

4

actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of

5

the population are in such States.

6

and you get these three other States, which raises the

7

percentage.

8
9
10

And -­

There are a number of

So if we look at the States that

You go back 15 years,

How -- how should I understand that?

I'm

interested in both sides -­
MR. LAYTON:

Frankly, we don't know what those

11

numbers mean because we don't know to what extent

12

juveniles are committing capital level murders.

13

there is no way in current social science to make that

14

determination.

15

We -- and

It's interesting that among the three States -­

16

two of the three States that are on that list that Justice

17

Breyer mentioned are States in which there is a specific

18

instruction to the jury, or indeed, in Texas, a

19

requirement, that the jury evaluate future dangerousness.

20

That is, the argument that was referred to by opposing -­

21

or that counsel made, the State's counsel made, the

22

prosecutor made, in the -- in the trial here, there's

23

actually an instruction in some of those States.

24

may play into the manner in which this -- those States -­

25

the reason those States have additional convictions and

And that

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

additional executions.

2

But Missouri doesn't have that.

We don't

3

require that the jury find future dangerousness, and

4

although that may come up in the course of a mitigation

5

and aggravation argument in the penalty phase, it isn't

6

highlighted like it is in those States.

7

more problematic than the system that Missouri has

8

created.

And that may be

9

If the kind of evidence, psychosocial evidence,

10

that is cited in Mr. Simmons' brief had been presented at

11

the penalty phase, of course there would have been an

12

opportunity to rebut it, to question it.

13

have in this case is the marshaling of untested evidence

14

from various cause groups and some dispassionate

15

observers.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Instead, what we

inserted into the record, Mr. Layton?
MR. LAYTON:

The -- the kind of -- well, as to

19

Mr. Simmons specifically, it came in in the post­

20

conviction proceeding, and then was also present in the

21

habeas record.

23

brief in this Court.

25

In this case, the -- the lengthy litany of

2

MR. LAYTON:

Oh, no.

Oh, no, because he never

3

made the argument in the trial court during his trial that

4

-- that scientifically he was too immature to be culpable

5

to the degree that would merit capital punishment.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, at least to the extent

7

that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance

8

to quote public sources in -- in return.

MR. LAYTON:

I -- and I think the reason that we

16

did that and we cited the difficulties in our reply brief

17

with what he cited is to highlight that the precise age is

18

a legislative question based on legislative type facts.

19

Legislatures can evaluate this series of studies and then

pick what is essentially an arbitrary age.

They talk about young adolescence, old

They talk about adolescence continuing until

That

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

makes it the kind of fact that a legislature ought to be

2

evaluating, not a court.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does adolescence as a

4

scientific term -- does it always occur on the same day

5

for -- for all individuals?

6

MR. LAYTON:

No.

The -- the studies point out

7

that adolescence is -- well, they don't agree on what

8

adolescence means, and they don't -- and they point out

9

that it begins and ends on different times for different

people.

11

studies, and we don't know what it would mean were the

12

Court to base a decision on the -- this concept of

13

adolescence.

So we don't know what adolescence means in the

I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, if
there are no other questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Everyone agrees that there is some age below

23

which juveniles can't be subjected to the death penalty.

24

The question here is where our society's evolving

25

standards of decency now draw that line.

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

15 years ago, this Court found insufficient

2

evidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since

3

Stanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific

4

evidence has emerged, and these developments change the

5

constitutional calculus for much the same reasons the

6

Court found compelling in Atkins.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As was noted -­

Can the constitutional calculus

8

ever move in the other direction?

9

that, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific

10

evidence that shows that some people are quite mature at

11

18 or at -- at 17-and-a-half or if -- if there is a -- a

12

new feeling among the people that youthful murderers are,

13

indeed, a serious problem and -- and deterrence is

14

necessary, can we ever go back?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

I mean, once we hold

Well, there is a -­
It's sort of a one-way ratchet.

Isn't it?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

There is a one-way ratchet here as

19

there is whenever this Court draws a constitutional line;

20

that is, whenever this Court determines that the

21

Constitution preempts the ability of legislatures to

22

make --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, but what -- what

24

if a State legislature decides that, sure, the Supreme

25

Court said in the Simmons case that you can't execute

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

anybody under 18, but we think there's kind of a tendency

2

the other way, we're going to pass a statute and see what

3

happens in court?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, you could -- you could have,

5

I guess, what I refer to as the Dickerson v. United States

6

phenomenon.

7

really interesting -- I think what's -­

8
9

It could come up.

But what's -- what's

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
closed book?

Is it -- is that a

I mean, granted, you may lose the argument,

10

but is it a permissible argument that the standards have

11

evolved the other way?

12
13

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- it certainly would be a

permissible -- permissible argument.

14

What's -- what's notable here, Justice Scalia

15

and Mr. Chief Justice, is how robust this consensus is.

16

We're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in

17

which our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line

18

between childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line

19

below which we preserve -- presume immaturity.

20

line with respect to executions, the trend is very robust

21

and it is very deep.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't -- we don't use 18 for

23

everything.

24

adolescents to drive at the age of 16?

25

Aren't there States that -- that allow

to the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus

Are you suggesting

that we adopt that principle?

MR. WAXMAN:

To the contrary.

My point is we

are not talking about just what a particular European

8

treaty requires.

9

that theoretically -- that have statutes that

We -- the -- the eight States that -­

10

theoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are

11

not only alone in this country, they are alone in the

12

world.

13

Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic

14

Republic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and

15

legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only

16

country besides the United States that has not is Somalia,

17

which as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no

18

organized government.

19

Every country in the world, including China and

It is incapable --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They have a lot of customs that

20

we don't have.

21

them do not allow -- have trial by jury.

22

they think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer

23

because juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot.

24

Should we yield to the views of the rest of the world?

25

They don't allow most -- almost all of

Of course not, but this is a -­

Alderson Reporting Company

this is a standard which -- a constitutional test that

looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to

3

human dignity.

4

that we are literally alone in the world even though 110

5

countries in the world permit capital punishment for one

6

purpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one -­

7

every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders.

8
9

And in that regard, it is -- it is notable

And, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that
that that's set -- you know, game, set, and match.

It's

10

just relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the

11

existence of a consensus.

12

There was reference made by my opponent to the

13

fact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and

14

four States that set the age at 16.

15

movement, no one has suggested that any of those States or

16

any other State has ever lowered the age.

17

look at those particular -- those eight States, a number

18

of them legislated an age that represented raising the

19

number over what had previously been permitted.

20

movement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins,

21

has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that

22

movement, in and of itself, answers the question.

24

it did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific

say there is scientific, empirical validation for

requiring that the line be set at 18.

They came

11

to us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite

correctly points out, and said that with reference to the

age for determining whether the child could have an

14

abortion without parental consent, that adults -- that

15

they -- that they were risk -- that they could assess

flip-flop in this case.

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

Well -Is that just because of -- is

that just because of this modern evidence?
MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

I don't -- I think

22

it's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy,

23

but I think the main point is that what their brief looked

24

to -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents

25

cognitively different than adults.

And the answer is, as

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

2

we -- our brief concedes, is generally no.
And what was at issue in the abortion cases was

competency to decide.

4

retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an

5

abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is

6

reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so

7

depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here

8

competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded,

9

isn't the issue.

10

And just as we allow the mentally

15

don't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now,

In fact, the difference here goes to the factors

that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the

19

mentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less

20

morally capable.

21

sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst.

22

And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the

23

few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even

24

determine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so

25

depraved that they were among the worst of the worst,

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, the number of

2

States that engage in these executions is very small, and

3

if it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth

4

Amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come -- would

5

ever have to be developed.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -But that's precisely because

7

the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating

8

factors.

9

for 16- to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed.

It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty
I would expect

10

it would be.

11

leave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and

12

take that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule

13

that nobody who is under 18 is -- is -- has committed such

14

a heinous crime with such intent that he -- that he

15

deserves the death penalty.

16

But it -- it's a question of whether you

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice -- Justice Scalia, there's

17

no doubt -- and the jury was instructed -- that age is a

18

mitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response

19

to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the

20

context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue

21

it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the

time.

think if you want to rely on evidence like that, it ought

to be introduced at trial and subject to cross examination

rather than just put in amicus briefs.

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, no, Mr. Chief Justice.

defendant, which would have been the only thing that would

an argument that science says people this age are simply

different, and it seems to me you -- if that's to be an

23

argument, it ought to be introduced at trial.

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I -- it's an argument about

what the Constitution prohibits.

It's an argument about

you're talking facts basically and facts ordinarily are

adduced at trial for cross examination.

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I am not aware of any

6

instance in which legislative facts, as you will call

7

them, that is, facts that go to where a line should be

8

drawn, whether it's by this Court because the Constitution

9

ought to be so interpreted or a legislation should change,

10

would be properly introduced to a jury that is supposed to

the things that are in your -- in your brief, and in fact

maybe the finding was deficient on that ground as well.

MR. WAXMAN:

adolescents are less mature and on a range of psychosocial

9

factors, they -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, he could have cited all

the -- all the authorities you cite in your brief.
MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

But, Justice Kennedy, I -­

I concede that.
The issue for this Court is whether the

15

Constitution requires that as a matter of law, not as a

16

matter of the application of law to a particular

17

defendant, the line has to be drawn this way, and -­

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose that all of

19

the things set forth in your brief were eloquently set

20

forth by a psychiatrist to the jury.

21

weigh these things that you're telling us?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Could the jury then

The jury could have weighed these

23

things, but there is no way, even for a psychiatrist or a

24

psychologist, much less a juror to -- to be confident

25

because of the inherent, documented transiency of the

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

adolescent personality.

No psychiatrist and no juror can

2

say with confidence that the crime that was committed by a

3

16- or 17-year-old, on the average 2 years ago -- and this

4

is the key point -- proceeded from enduring qualities of

5

that person's character as opposed to the transient

6

aspects of youth, and therefore -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But now, that -- that

8

itself is a purported scientific fact, what you just said,

9

and it seems to me if we're -- if we're to rely on that,

10

it ought to have been tested in the way most facts are.

11
12

MR. WAXMAN:

What the jury -- perhaps I'm not

understanding your point.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, you're -- you're

14

relying on factual -- the statement you just made was -­

15

was a factual statement about the enduring character, et

16

cetera.

17

ought to have been tested somewhere rather than just given

18

to us in a brief.

19

Now, if -- if we are to take that as a fact, it

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the -- the -- an argument to

20

the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a

21

psychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as

22

a group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile

23

personalities that it is impossible to know whether

24

they're -- the crime that they committed reflected an

25

enduring character is an argument that could have been

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not

2

have been credited or given dispositive weight,

3

particularly since at sentencing -- and this Court has

4

acknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope

5

v. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody,

6

determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if you're reluctant

8

to give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then

9

you come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a

10
11

general rule, that seems to me inconsistent.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, no.

What I'm -- what I'm

12

asking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight

13

of scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can

14

take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and

15

did take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson

16

and Stanford explains and validates the consensus that

17

society has drawn.

18

what a particular neurobiologist or developmental

19

psychologist says dictates the line of 18.

20

is we have a consensus.

21

in Atkins.

22

with respect to that consensus, is there a good,

23

objective, scientific reason to credit the line that

24

society has drawn?

25

We're not arguing that the science or

The question

1

although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-

2

olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather

3

than transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this

4

from common sense and it's been validated by science, of

5

which the Court can take note, that it is impossible to

6

know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17­

7

year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character

8

or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are

9

exhibited during adolescence.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -­

Well, suppose -- suppose I -­

11

I were not convinced about your scientific evidence was

12

conclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus.

13

lose the case, or can you then make the same argument you

14

just made appealing to some other more fundamental

15

principle that Stanford was just wrong?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that -- that's

18

-- that last point was what I thought the scientific

evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what

20

common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15

21

or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that

22

person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a

meaningful sense.

formed.

2

Now, I thought that the -- the scientific

3

evidence simply corroborated something that every parent

4

already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to

5

know what more.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's

7

more than that in a couple of respects.

8

explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of

9

intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that

10

-- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents.

11

And -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just

12

talking about social science here, but the important

13

neurobiological science that has now shown that these

14

adolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired.

15

It's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting

16

and relevant scientific fact.

17

DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their

18

Bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial

19

personality before the age of 18 precisely because before

20

the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed

MR. WAXMAN:

I think, with respect, Justice

10

Scalia, I'm not -- I think that there is an interesting

11

question about -- with respect to death, whether what they

12

are and what they will become is totally irrelevant.

13

But accepting the premise of your question, my

14

point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively

15

know, which is that when the jury gets around to

16

evaluating what the character was that manifested that

17

horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of

18

age and because of a number of confounding factors and

19

because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell

20

themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or

21

2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character

22

or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Is part of your answer

24

based on the length of time between the killing and the

25

trial?

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WAXMAN:

Only part, Mr. Chief Justice.

Part

2

of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the

3

defendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed

4

scientific studies that show that they -- that people are

5

-- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development

6

with race and with physical appearance.

7

because the adolescent personality is transient and the

8

lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense

9

psychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically,

10

the person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a

11

manifestation of the person who committed the crime.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

In addition,

Well, what if -- what

13

if a State said I see the problem, so we'll bring this

14

person to trial in 6 weeks?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Even if it were in 6 weeks, Mr.

16

Chief Justice, we believe that the process is -- is

17

sufficiently -- that would just make the youth the same as

18

the mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have

19

stable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what

20

this Court said in Atkins was we have two things to say.

21

One is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally

22

retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the

23

worst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you

24

called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of

25

their impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

evaluating the moral culpability, the moral

2

blameworthiness unreliable.

3

those two things that we think that the consensus that's

4

otherwise reflected is validated.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's on the basis of

And here -­

I have -- I have one other

6

question I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me

7

and I want your comment.

8
9

A number of juveniles run in gangs and a number
of the gang members are over 18.

If we ruled in your

10

favor and this decision was given wide publicity, wouldn't

11

that make 16-, 17-year-olds subject to being persuaded to

12

be the hit men for the gangs?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

Well -­
I'm -- I'm very concerned

about that.
MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I am also concerned about it,

17

and I -- I have thought about this.

First of all, if they

18

are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the

19

-- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people

20

who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether

21

people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them.

22

But even -- but with respect to -­

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm talking about the

24

deterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16­

25

and 17-year-old.

If -- if we rule against you, then the

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

deterrent remains.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think -- I think, as with

3

the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the

4

mentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of

5

deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they

6

weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and

7

they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure.

8
9

And in fact, if you look at what happened in
this case, it's as good an example as any.

The State

10

says, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy,

11

according to the State's witness, the person, who was over

12

18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles,

13

testified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says,

14

let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, there were a number -- a

16

number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is

17

chilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that

18

sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before

19

they sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year-

20

old is the ringleader.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the 17-year-old may be the

22

ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons

23

was the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any

24

illusions.

He wasn't making a statement about being

25

executed.

He said, we could get away with it, which

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

speaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this

2

guy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice

3

Scalia, fundamentally different than death.

4

has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look

5

at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature

6

of the crime and the act.

7

This Court

But the data shows -- and I think this Court has

8

acknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event

9

-- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally

10

retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the

11

prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very

12

substantial penalty.

13

thought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away

14

with this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory

15

punishment for him would have been life in prison.

16

The -- no mature adult would have

It's -- it is not -- eliminating the death

17

penalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so

18

rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was

19

in Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one -­

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But of course, the death

21

penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes

22

described in the Alabama brief because those are all -­

23

crimes all occurred in States which execute people under

24

18.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, and I -- and I -- the -- the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

examples in the Alabama brief are horrifying.

2

look at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid

3

who went on a killing spree, including his father, because

4

he felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck.

5

And there -- I can go through the other examples, but

6

these are posited as people who a jury could, with a

7

degree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say

8

acted out of a stable, enduring character rather than

9

transient aspects of youth?

10
11
12

I think that's a poster child

for us.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whereas if it had been done by

an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

But if you

Well -­
If an 18-year-old did the same

thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

May I answer?

17

The line -- the science shows what common sense

18

understands which is that development is a continuum, but

19

the line, 18, is one that has been drawn by society.

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LAYTON:

Mr. Simmons, of course, was found

2

by the jury to be the ringleader.

3

creates a contrast with the Lee Malvo case where we had

something like what Justice Kennedy referred to, adults

influencing a juvenile, and the jury was able to make that

6

distinction in the Virginia Lee Malvo case.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And in essence, that

May I ask this question, Mr.

8

Layton?

This case kind of raises a question about the

9

basic State interests that are involved here, and the

10

State interests that justify the death penalty include

11

deterrence and also retribution.

12

MR. LAYTON:

Yes.
Which, if either, of those do

you think is the primary State interest you seek to

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

MR. LAYTON:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just ask one further?

Yes.
Is there any evidence that the

24

death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in

25

fact, had any deterrent value?

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LAYTON:

From all that I have read, the

2

evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and

3

thus, subject to legislators' determination.

4

Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking

5

the Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to

6

-- to a consensus.

7

of the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of

8

this Court.

9

But let me just highlight two aspects

Justice Kennedy, in -- in Harmelin recently

10

cited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of

11

the considerations in proportionality review in those

12

instances are the primacy of the legislature and the

13

nature of the Federal system.

14

a principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity,

15

and the States, within the Federal system, should be able

16

to make the determination as to how to implement it.

17

What we should have here is

As pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in

18

Eighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet,

19

and because of that, the Court has to be very wary of

20

leading rather than reflecting societal norms.

21

are some States, of course, that have raised the age, the

22

minimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some

23

instances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this

24

Court's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and

25

Stanford.

Now, there

Other States have left 18 for other purposes,

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and yet there still is a role by this Court.

2

Pornography is an example.

I am confident that

3

but for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the

4

Missouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said

5

that pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher

6

than 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their

7

opposition to pornography.

8

In many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons,

9

the kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others,

10

it is a compromise in the legislative arena, not

11

necessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to

12

the selection of the age of 18.

13

course, individualized determinations with regard to those

14

statutes.

15

In Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age

16

15.

17

also is a test.

18

determination before we do that, and that's what the State

19

requests here.

Many States have, of

There was a discussion of driver's licenses.

They have to have parental consent, yes, but there
That is, there is an individualized

20

Mr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins

21

the Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence,

22

and that's true.

23

the Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a -­

24

a factor that plays into culpability.

25

the factor itself, that is mental capacity.

The Court did.

But remember that what

It was, in fact,
And what they

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

want here is not a determination as to the maturity or the

2

capacity of individuals.

3

that is based purely on age.

4

They want a bright line test

This Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a

5

principle and leave it to the States to act.

6

the Court did in --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's what

Of course, one -- one of the

8

objections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line

9

test.

We'd have difficulty determining which ones are

10

mentally retarded.

11

all.

12

is over or under 18.

13

Here we don't have that problem at

I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant

MR. LAYTON:

Well, if that's the bright line.

14

We don't know whether they're mature or immature, and we

15

have to measure that somehow.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the -- but the purpose of

17

a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the

18

borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided

19
