ORAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES vah R. SPRINGER» ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

We will hear arguments

MR. SPRINGER:'

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The question on the merits of this eas© is the

11

validity of the selective Service regulation that says that

12

a registrant may not be represented by a lawyer when he has his

13

personal appearance before his local draft board.

14

The Appellee» Weller» was classified 1-A after such

15

a personal appearance» or rather his 1-A classification was

16

retained —I will go into the procedures after a bit» after

17

such a personal appearance.

18

But he refused to submit to induction when ordered

19

to report by the board and accordingly he was indicted.

20

District Court dismissed the indictment before trial» based on

21

a motion filed actually before there was a plea to indictment

22

on the ground that Weller6s lack ofcounsel at the personal

23

appearance invalidated the order to report.

24

States has appealed front that order dismissing the indictment.

Q

Is that

■12

A

That would not benecessary*

Mr.Justice

13

Brennan* because of the provision in the Criminal Appeals Act

14

that says that appeals improperly brought here

15

Q

Transferred —

16

A

Remanded is the word

17

that

is used.

And* of

course* we filed — in lieu of the jurisdictional statement*

18

v?e filed something called a motion to remand and the Court has

19

deferred the issue of jurisdiction until this time.

20

So* I would like to speak for a few minutes at the

21

outset about the jurisdictional question.

22

case comes up on the grant of the motion of ~ of a pretrial

23

motion to dismiss the indictment under Rule 12 of the Criminal

24

Rules of Procedure.

25

As I indicated* this

The motion to dismiss was originally based on two

4

I

grounds; first a claim that Weller's 1-A classification was

2

improper because there was no basis in fact for denial of his

3

conscientious objector claim and seconds the motion asserted

4

the claim which is what is before ~ more specifically before

5

the Court now that the order to report was invalid because

6

Weller was, in several respects, denied due process at his

7

personal appearance1, before the board.

8
9

Principally, in that he was not allowed to be
represented by counsel, and that is the only issue that sur­

10

vived as a live issue to tills point, but he also contended

11

initially in his motion that the local boards had improperly

12

denied his request to have witnesses with him and to have a

13

court reporter transcribe the proceedings of the' personal

14

appearance„

15

There was no hearing on the motion to dismiss the

16

indictment and the Diestrict Court granted the motion on the

17

basis of the indictment itself and WEller"s selective service

18

file, which of course, was undisputed as to its contents, which

19

had been attached as an exhibit to the motion to dismiss that

20

he had filed.

21

The selective service file showed on its face that

22

Weller9s..lawyer had. written letters to the draft board asking

23

'that he be allowed to appear with Weller and for the other

24

procedures that are mentioned and that the local board had

25

denied them in reliance on the regulations.
5

1

The District Court concluded in a written opinion

2

that -the

3

one that provides that "No registrant may be represented

4

before their local board by anyone acting as attorney or legal

S

counsel," wds an invalid regulation.

6

that the regulation was unconstitutional under the Due Process

proceedings.

The Distxiet Court considered that the denial of

ii
12

selective service regulation in question here, the

counsel before the local draft board at a personal appearance
was a matter of doubtful constitutionality and therefore it

14

considered that the regulation could not foe valid unless there

15

was express Congressional authority for its promulgation by the

16

President.

17

stances that I will discuss when I reach the merits, as I

18

will, the District Court decided -that the general statutory

19

grant of authority for the President to establish selective

20

service procedures did not clearly enough authorise him to

21

promulgate a regulation that excluded representation by counsel,,

22

And the District Court found, despite the circum»

As I indicated, it’s plain that this

.

So, the only question under the Criminal Appeals

3

Act is whether the judgment, was one "based on the invalidity

4

or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or

5

information is founded," or in the alternative, whether it was

6

a "decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar,.'5

7

If it was either of those -then the appeal would be

8

directly to this Court.

We say, however, that it was neither,

9

so that the appeal should be in the Court of Appeals for the

10

Ninth Circuit, under that part of the statute which gives

11

Courts of Appeals jurisdiction over any decision or judgment

12

dismissing any indictment except for a direst appeal to the

13

Supreme Court as provided by the section.

Also we do

believe strongly in the general principle underlying much of

this Court8s jurisdiction that cases should be considered in

the Courts of Appeals before 'they come here»

5

in the principle that underlies -the majority view in the

We had a dilemma, frankly, as we frequently have under this

11

Act, in knowing where to go first.

Of courset we raised this at

But X think the principle — the basis principle in

13

which this question ought to be considered is'the principle,

14

as X indicated, that the Court has recognised ana number of

15

occasions that the Criminal Appeals Act is a technical statute

16

that historically arose from a clear Congressional compromise,

17

rather than from any single coherent, all-embracing legisla­

18

tive purpose and therefore that it should be read narrowly.

19

And I think that principle is especially apt in this situation

20

where the issue is not whether there is an appeal or not, but

21

simply where it should foe.

22

So, in a sense, the practical issue is an issue of

23

the management of appellate business rather than deciding

24

whether or not a litigant, that is the Government, has a right

25

t© appeal or not.

In that sense, I think it might be said that
9

1

less is at stake than, for example, in the Sisson case where

2

there was an issue of whether or not there would be any appeal

3

at all*

4

In light of that we think it is fair to say that

5

the burden of argumentative persuasion should be on -those who

6

say that this appeal should come directly to this Court, short»

circuiting the more conventional initial review in the Courts

8

of Appeals»

9

that are under -- that underlie some of the Court's decisions

10

in the three-judge court area in civil eases where there is a

n

similar principle of narrow reading of a technical statute»

iz

In this respect it is somewhat like the principles

Let me then turn to the two statutory issues.

First,

13

the question whether the dismissal of Weller's indictment on

14

‘the ground ‘that the procedural regulations followed by -the

15

local draft board was insufficiently authorised by the statute.

16

The Appellee says that -that is ~ that decision amounted to a

1?

construction of the statute on which the indictment is based,»

18

that iss the Selective Service Act,
The clear answer to that is that the dismissal was

19

20

based on the regulation, not on the act and the Court held the

21

regulation to be invalid under a principle of, 1 guess you

22

would call general law, that regulations, impairing procedural

23

rights are invalid unless Congress has specifically authorised

24

them»

25

negative ©na.

The only reference to the statute, therefore, was a
And we do not think that a determination that an
10

i

act doss not say something on the subject has to be treated as

2

a construction " of the statute" under this technical act

3

which, as we say, could be read narrowly.
Q

4

The regulation itself didn't purport to

S

either constitute the offense, establish the offense or to

6

interpret the statute of what the offense was?
A

7

No, it doss not; it's a regulation under a

8

general authorisation. So in that respect it is different from

9

the Mersky case, I think.

m

Q

That's a lot of difference,

n

A

Where the regulation was, first, a substan­

12

tive regulation and seconds one directly contemplated by the

13

statute to fill out our gap —

Was this motion of the Government's

A

It was filed before the Sisson decision

18

Q

It was filed before Sisson came down?

13

A

Yes, yes.

20

Clearly it was — I'm not sure;

I think it was early this year.

21

Q

January, I think; yes.

22

A

Yes.

Q

Is it your position that

the Court cannot

consider this case for jurisdictional reasons, or that it

21

cases, decide it.

22

A

This has been pending two years, hasn't it?
Yes.

Of course, Mr. Justice Black, I believe

2

think that's not available now because the case is not in the

Q

That may be an adequate reason»

So, we do think that this is a very different

Q

kind of situation from the Mersky situation where the Court

7

could say and did say, again over the Government's contrary

Q
9

'arguments that the regulations were so closely intertwined
with the statute that the issue of interpretation of the

10

regulations should be considered as an issue of interpretation

of the statute»

12

This brings me to the motion in bar point which

13

the Appellee urges alternatively as a basis for this Court's

14

jurisdiction, I think Sisson again makes it clear that the

15

IS

question of what a motion in bar is is a question that is still
j
open but we would urge the Court to adopt the definition

17

suggested by Mr, Justice Stewart's opinion in the Mersky ease,

18

whcih would limit a motion in bar to matters in confession and

19

avoidancef such as res adjudicata or the statute of limitations

20

or a denial of speedy trial.

21

that do not go to the general issue* but which solely on the

22

basis of new matter would prevent a conviction* even if the

13

that this is not new matter.

2

implicit in the indictment is an allegation that the process

was a valid and proper order.

ORAL ARGUMENT (CONTINUED) BY JAMES van R.

SPRINGER, OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

MR. SPRINGER:

8

I would like to say just a couple of words more

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

about jurisdiction and then move on to the. merits, if I can.
We were in the middle of a poinc about the applica­

10
11

bility of a motion in bar clause at the lunch hour.

As I

12

indicated, we think that that clause should be interpreted in

13

terms of the common law concept of a special plea in bar and

14

there are indications in the legislative history that that is,

15

in fact, what Congress had in mind in ,1907 when it passed the

16

act.
That is, the principle is that a motion in bar

17

13

relates only to a defense? it does not go to a general issue

19

and which on the basis of new matter, would prevent the con­

20

viction even if the defendant committed the act.alleged in the

21

indictment„

22

Q

Would that necessitate overruling Mersky?

23

A

I think not, because Mersky held nothing

24

about a motion in bar.

In Mersky, the Court found — the

25

majority found jurisdiction on the basis of the construction of
15

1

the statute»

Q

That was a little sideline —

appeals, proposed criminal appeals?

Wall, I just heard another indication at

11

lunch time.

IE

13

Assistance ~ well, it's a little more complicated than that —

14

X understand it's the Lai^ Enforcement Assistance Bill»

15

been passed by the Senate with the Criminal Appeals Act Amend­

16

ment in it but the House has not — well, the House is going

17

to pass the basic bill»

18

the amendment, so it's a matter of working it out- in conference

19

and getting it

It is in the —- as X indicated earlier ~ it is

It has

The House has not passed specifically

20

Q

Would it affect this

2?

A

I think it would, because as X Understand, -the;

22

bill would quite clearly resolve this-problem.

in fact I've

23

had some indications that the bill may eventually come out with

24

a provision only .for appeal to the Court of Appeals, reserving

25

this court for certiorari.

In any event, I think it's clear
16

i

that the bill* if it's accepted in anything like the form in

2

which it has bean so far* would not allow direct appeal in any

3

case that does not involve the validity of the underlying

4

statute»

5

statute issue or themotion in bar issue* I think clearly* as I

6

understand the bill.

7

So that we wouldn9t have this construction of the

The point I think on this motion in bar* is sorie-

8

thing raising new matter that would prevent a conviction even

9

if the defendant has committed the act with which he's charged*

10

is fch*afc the defense that Weller has raised here is not that

ii

kind of defense.

12

there was no offense.

13

saying that "There is some external reason why I canst be con­

14

victed for it;" ha says there is no offense because implicit

15

in the indictment is an allegation that the order to report

16

for induction was invalid.

17

me ~ that the order to report was valid.

13

order to report was invalid because of the procedural defect

19

His defense raised in his motion is that
He5s not confessing the offense and

He claims that tills order -- excuse
He claims that the

and hence* that he committed no crime when he failed to take

20

his step1forward at the induction station.

21

his motion presented a purely legal defense* based on the face

22

of the record and under the common law principle of special

23
24
25

So we think that

'plea in bar* a motion in bar that that does not qualify.
So* for that reason we think that the case should be
remanded to the Court of Appeals and that this Court may not
17

reach the merits»

2

that, 1 will now proceed to the merits.

But, since the Court might disagree with

simply, in the terns of the District Court's opinion, as well
as the President,

had authority from Congress to promulgate the

n

selective service regulation which has been in force, I might:

12

say, since 1940, that is throughout, the entire modern history

13

of selective service.

14

regulation which reads:

15

his personal appearancebefore the local board by anyone acting

16

as attorney or legal counsel.

validity of that regulation on its face.

So, the question is the

Before I go on to discuss the arguments made by the

21

22

District Court and by the- Appellee, I think it would bs helpful

£3

to put the question in context by describing the role that the

24

personal appearance has in the selective service classification

25

process„
18

f

That process begins, of course, when a young man

2

registers with his local board.

3

him a classification questionnaire which he fills out and which

4

then goes into a selective service file bearing his name,

5

together with any other written information of any kind that

6

the registrant or anyone else on his behalf chooses to provide

7

to the board.

8
9

Subsequently the board sends

In the case of someone who, like Weller, claims to
be a conscientious objector, this includes the form 150, the

10

special CO form and it can include, under the regulations, any

11

other written request for a particular classification or any

12

documents, affidavits or depositions, subject only to the con­

13

dition that they are as concise and as brief as possible.

14

That is, there is nothing to stop a registrant from

15

filing a complete legal brief with his board on his classifi­

16

cation if he chooses to.

17

Then when the tirae comes, the board classifies each

18

registrant at a formal meeting and the regulations provide,

19

and I think this is important, quite explicitly that the

20

classification must be done on the basis of the entire file and

2!

nothing other than written material that appears in that file.

22

And of course the registrant or anyone he authorizes, has the

23

right to inspect that file.

24
25

Then, after the board makes its initial classifica­
tion decision they send a notice of classification to the
19

1

2

registrant»

And then, for the first time, he has a right to

the personal ,appearance- that we are talking about, before -the

Congress has gone through in 1967 in connection with the latest

revision of this Selective Service Act.

18

at that time both in the House Committee? and in fact? an

19

4

course, one of the problems and one of the reasons, I think,

7

of proceedings from the relatively informal discussion

Congress had in mind.

Yes, and within the discretion of the board.

And of course, in this case, Weller's lawyer asked to corae in

as a lawyer and the District Court decided on the basis that he

20

should be there as a lawyer so that he can ask questions to

clarify matters and help the board make its decision and in the

sense in which lawyers ordinarily do when they are acting as

23

lawyers.

The board can, if it wishes, permit him to

have a lawyer to proceed as a lawyer?
21

A

Mo, no.

The regulation says absolutely

not.

3

that Congress had in mind in trying to keep this in a relatively

4

informal nonadversary proceeding.

5

I referred to relating to general rights of counsel before ad­

6

ministrative agencies.

7

specifically that under regulations prescribed by the President

8

a registrant may not be represented before a local draft board

9

by an attorney.

I am just indicating a little further what the purpose is

In this 1965 legislation

The House Report on that bill noted

This is because of the large number of regis­

10

trants involved; the informality of procedures and the need for

1.1

a capacity to provide large number of men quickly for service.

12

And again, in connection with the 1967 draft legis­

13

lation there is a certain amount of Congressional discussion

14

about the reasons for rejecting the proposals then that there

15

should be lawyers, again suggesting that it's inconsistent with

18

the basic duty of the Selective Service System which, of course

17

this Court has recognized in numerous cases and recognized, for

18

example in Clark against Gabriel in the context of preinduction

19

judicial review, that the1'purpose of the Selective Service

20

System is to raise large numbers of men without litigious in­

21

terruptions which Congress has, I think reasonably, believed

22

would incur that obligation.

23

Thera is some further suggestion in the legislative

24

history of 1967 that another Congressional feeling which, again

25

I think is reasonable, that the more formalized these
28

1

proceedings become the greater advantage is given to those who

2

for one reason or another are in a better position to take

3

advantage of formalised proceedings --

I think it, as with all of these matters, you can't
proceed by a process of deductive reasoning.

You can't say

that, as he does, that the personal appearance is obviously an
important matter for a draft registrant.
30

It's a matter

in which his personal rights are determined; therefore it is

must have a lawyer because the court said so in Goldberg

5

I think the whole preraise ©f -the Goldberg against

6

Kelly decision is that you balance each situation.

7

there was a relatively limited kind of hearing, but to ba sure,

8

the court did say a lawyer should be present.

9

the draft situation can't be deduced from that; I think it's

10

a matter of making the same kind of balancing process in the

11

draft context, which is something that Congress has done, for

12

the reasons that 1 have indicated, and I think that cannot be .■

this Court's Gutknecht decision last term took away from the

an area with considerable discretion which the Court felt the

boards hadn't been given.

12

.So that area is out.

As of last spring, occupational deferrments were

which we are dealing with here, following a decision in Welsh,

22

specifically last term, the National Director of Selective

23

Service put out a fcwo-page statement of the consideration that

24

the boards should take into account in determining whether a

25

man is a conscientious objector, which I think boils down —

16

General when the Solicitor General states that Judge Peckham's

17

decision in the Northern District of California is based only

18

on the question of whether or not the regulation was authorised

by statute.

20

the denial of counsel, 'that is the regulation prohibiting the

10

This myth, 1 submit, was always based on fiction,

11

but the myth has now been officially disembodied by a change

12

in the regulations mentioned in my brief which I will get to

13

later in my argument? and the time has long come for it to be

14

finally exorcised.

15

If I may touch upon the jurisdictional question.

16

Frankly, the first point which X was going to make was that

17

which I believe came out in the colloquy between Mr. Justice

18

Brennan and my learned adversary.

19

clearly indicated that it disagrees with the position of Judge

20

Peckham.

2!

Government cites in its brief prior to his decision and at leas

22

one decision subsequent thereto.

The Minth Circuit has quite

37

1

Justice Stewart and

I beg your pardon? it3s the Evans

decision, Mr. Justice Stewart.
3
4

Itss cited on page 37 of the

Government's brief and someplace in our brief.
The question before this Court, I submit, on the

3

jurisdictional point, is whether the Government was right when

6

it first took the position that there was exclusive and man­

7

datory jurisdiction in this Court, or whether the Government

8

was right after it reconsidered it and took the position that

9

it should remand and have a go at the Ninth Circuit.

1©

Well, of course, I don't deny for one minute that

11

the Department of Justice and the Solicitor General's office

12

are as interested in the administrative of justice as those of

13

us in the defense bar are, but the fact is that one cannot

14

overlook the fact that any experience there would recognise

15

the inevitability of the Ninth Circuit overruling Judge Peckham

16

and I do not believe that the Government was unaware of that.

17

If the question is asked as to why this case was

18

brought to the Supreme Court in the first place, I would refer

19

the Court to Appendix C to the Government's brief, which is a

20

letter written by the distinguished former Director of the

2!

Selective Service System, General Lewis B. Hershey, addressed

22

to the Attorney General.

23

of the .Government's brief.

24
25

This is reprinted at pages 74 and 75

General Hershey takes the view, and I quote, "The
effect, of- this decision, if allowed to stand unchallenged,
38

1

would be to place an intolerable upon the administration ef the

z

Selective -Service System in'the Northern District of Califor­

3

4

constructive paralysis of the Selective Service System in the

5

performance of its mission of procurement of manpower for the

Department of Defense."

7

Then it sites various decisions, including the

8

Ninth Circuit and then states; aThe Congress of the United

9

States, in enacting and reenacting the selective service laws

10

opinions in the Sisson case and in the Mersky case and in the

20

problems that the Solicitor General8s office grapples with,

2

one thing, I think, becomes clear, and that is that it was -the

22

— it is the philosophy of the Criminal Appeals Act that where

23

there are truly vital important constitutional questions in

24

criminal cases, that the path should be smooth for their being

25

And I suggest that where the —-

3

Justice White, went off on a number of other problems.

Obviously the man appeared before the jury and there was

jeopardy in that case.
But f it seems ‘that where the man who has been head­

The practical consideration?

Justice.

12

that which was revealed in the colloquy between Mr. Justice

13

Brennan and Mr. Springer -that if the Government succeeds on its

14

jurisdictional point the case will go to the Ninth Circuit and

15

the decision of the Ninth Circuit has been clearly foreshadowed

16

by the Evans case and others.

17

is that we will be back here again? but this time we will be

18

back as supplicants? as petitioners for certiorari? rather than

19

as parties with a legal right to a decision by the highest court

20

of the land.

21

Q

22
23

Then, of course, the probability

What about Mr. Springer's point that your

position is that no crime was committed?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall, our position is that

24

the facts alleged in the indictment did, indeed? occur and our

position is that there was? in fact? an induction refusal? as

Now, I suggest that confession and avoidance as

They spoke for the traditional view of the

1 have always unsLessteod it was a matter of pleading, whether
itss common law pleading or modern pleading, is that you admit
to the indictment, but you say that there is something else
which gives you a legal right to be exonerated, notwithstanding
the admission of the act,of the indictment.

\
Q

Well, then the only difference to whether or
*s

not the valid induction order is a part of the acts 'the
Solicitor General said it is a part and you say it is not a

42

1

part.

The act is only the failure to take the one step for­

2

ward,

Is that your position?

3

A

That is our position, Mr. Justice Marshall.

4

May I also point out that the indictment itself refers to all

5

of the selective service regulations, at least applicable

6

selective service regulations , as being part of the crime of

7

which the defendant is accused.

8

fically specifies the whole body of regulations, including the

9

regulations governing the rights of personal appearance and

10

And the indictment speci­

the absence of counsel thereof.

11

Of course, under the view of motion in bar, which

12

was taken by Mr. Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion in

13

the Mersky case, we should confine the medieval pleading

14

motions to the dusty bookshelves, if I recall the adjectives

IS*

correctly, and that a motion in bar assists where there is a

16

termination of the cause and an exculpation of the defendant.

17

And of course, that clearly occurred in this case.

18

In this case the judge decided that the regulation

10

was not authorised by the statute in the first instance.

20

the second instance he decided that the regulation, in any

21

event, could not have been authorized, that it was beyond

22

constitutional power because of the nature of this type of a

23

hearing„

24
25

In

And, in either case, there was a major decision
concerning unconstitutionality of a vital part of the Selective

43

1

2

Service Administration.
I would take the position that all of the starry

3

and interesting discussions in Sisson really1 does not take our

4

case any further than it was before, I say with respect.

5

think that we are exactly in the same situation which 'Mr.

8

Justice Harlan projected in the Blue case, where the question

7

is do we apply Mr. Justice Brennan5® standard of the Mersky

8

case, or do we apply the standard of Mr. Justice Stewart and

9

the other dissenters in the Mersky case?

10

I

And that under any standard, whether it's the only

11

thing which exculpates standard or the confession and avoid­

12

ance standard, that just as Blue made it to the Supreme Court

13

directly — he had a right to in that case, Weller should have

14

a right to male© it directly to the Supreme Court in this case.

15

Q

Mr. Karpatkim, suppose the Government had,

16

however, appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

your avenue of relief, by way ©f getting here?

18

be in the Minth Circuit, period?

19

A

What would have been
Where would you

1 would suppose, Mr. Justice Blackmun, 'that

20

we would probably make a motion to dismiss the appeal on the

21

grounds that there was direct and exclusive jurisdiction in the

22

Supreme Court of the United States.

23

25

Q

So that you would interpret 3731 to where it

says an appeal may be taken, into mandatory language, then?

Well, was that the -- was that an avenue by

1 believe that the Ninth Circuit-expressed

its uncertainty about that, in that case, Mr» Justice Blackmon.
The other aspect of ‘th® jurisdcifcioi^al point, con­

13
14

cerns statutory construction.

13

rest firmly with the majority opinion in Mersky.

16

clear, as I see it, that where a regulation is so closely

17

linked or closely coupled or associated with the statute, that

18

the validity of one must perforce be determinative of the

19

validity of the other that what the court has done in dismis­

20

sing the indictment based upon the construction of such a

21

statute — brings it within the statutory construction language

22

©f 3731.

23

Q

Now, here I believe that we

Absolutely silent, Mr. Justice White.
And the regulation expressly says that you

Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.
And 1 suppose the District Judge"says there

is some rule of. law in this context which means that a silent

statute just doesn't authorize the regulation.

8

a construction of the statute?

9

A

Now, is that

Well, 1 think it is a construction of the

statute,- but I believe that the District Judge went further

11

than that —

Q

13
14

You mean because you read it and said it was

silent, that’s the construction or ■—
A

As I see what the District Judge did, Mr.

15

Justice White, is that he looked to the provisions of the

16

statute and found them silent.

17

statute directed the President to select men for military ser­

18

vice in a fair and impartial manner.

19

directed the President to set up a network of local boards and

20

appeal boards.

21

directed these local boards to make — t© hear and determine

22

all'questions concerning inclusions, exemptions and deferrments

authorised.

5

the District Judge is absolutely correct in invoking the

6

principle of Greene against McElroy and Hanna against Larche

7

and many other decisions of this court to find that wherever

8

something gets so close to a constitutional right* Congress

9

must act explicitly.

o

Q

Well* that's not construing the statute?

n

that's not construing the statute.

12

there is a principle about regulations that some are good and

some are bad*

issues and unless the statute expressly authorises them —

15

A

That's just saying that

depending on how close they are to constitutional

Well* it seems to me again* Mr. Justice;

16

White* that ‘the District Judge was looking with a magnifying

17

glass or microscope from the beginning of the statute to the

18

end* looking through every clause which could possibly have

19

some relationship with

it and he found that there was none.

But if a District Judge reads a decision of

21

this court which says that any regulation which denies counsel

22

must at least have express Congressional authorization.

23

looks in the statute? he doesn't find any authorization and he

24

says that the regulation is invalid.

25

He

How* is that a construction of a statute or is it

41

1

basing a decision on a decision of this Court?

-5

A

6m

Well, I believe, since the Government takes

3

the position that the statute, properly construed, should in­

4

dicate Congressional acquiescence in the existing pattern of

3

denial of counsel, that the District — and since I am sure

6

his position was ably urged by the United States Attorney

7

in the Northern District ©f California, the District Judge had

8

to examine the statute and to see if it shouldbeconstrued from

9

the point of view advocated by the Government.

10

I guess perhaps there may foe some —

11

Q

Instead of saying — what you are saying is

12

‘chat the Government is either -- is arguing both sides of the

13

road when it says that the statute is silent on the one hand,

14

but it isn't silent on the other, because of Congressional

15

acquiescence 0

16

A

You have anticipated my next observation

17

much more aptly, Mr. Justice White.

18

that to serve its purposes on the Congressional authorisation

19

point, the Government tried to couple for"link the statute and

20

the regulation as closely together as possible.

21

to fuse them together with the best writing??) material that

22

it has.

23

I was going to say, indeed

It even tries

That, for purposes of meeting its jurisdictional

24

argument, the government tries to separate them and this leads

25

to a little bit of sehis20phrenia in the Government's brief
48

because they refer at one place they refer to the statute and
•the regulation combined as "the law" of selective service»
If obviously suits their purpose to argue that this is "the
law" of selective service on the merits while it doesn’t suit
their purpose to do so on the jurisdictional point»
I think9 though, that the final point on jurisdic­
tion has to do with the Government6s concession, as it must
concede that there was direct jurisdiction in this Court ©n
statutory construction in the Eisdorfer ease,

The Government

argues that there is some difference between Eisdorfer and this
case because Eisdorfer involves the delinquency regulations
while this case involves a regulation prohibiting counsel»
Well, the Government. says that there is this
difference»

If doesn’t say why this makes a difference»

argues that one is more remote than another»

It

But, I submit,

that the delinquency regulations, as anyone who has read the
Gestereich and Guchknect and Blue decisions of this Court,
knows involves procedure perhaps even more so than it involves
substance.
And the regulation involved in this ease is ob­
viously also a procedural regulation»
Q
Court, was it?
A

The Eisdorfer case wasn't a decision of this
It was dismissal under Rule 60»
It certainly was, Mr, Justice Harlan? yes»

It was not a decision of this Court,

Q

Yes? lesc

2

A

18m pointing out that the Government is

3

trying to explain the illogic in its position and I believe

4

■they had a lot of explaining to do.

5

IF I may move now to the point on the merits.

We

6

start With the proposition announced by this Court in Greene

7

against Me Elroy, and foreshadowed the previous decisions and

8

following later decisions? that since only Congress can draft?

9

only Congress can deny the right to counsel as part of the

10

drafting process.

11

Government almost admits it and except for one place? page 22

12

of its brief where it seems to suggest that maybe this is not

13

so and that maybe there are limits on Presidential power to

14

deny counsel or to otherwise structure the hearings and the

15

implication perhaps is that maybe there are not even any

16

limits on other Presidential war powers? a point which the

11

Government tantalisingly suggests? and doesn3t move on.

18

then once again it talks about nonjusticiability and to my

19

surprise? the case which it cited is an order of this Court

20

denying certiorari.

2!

It seems that this is self-evident and the

tod

tod of course? Ms taught from my first breath of

22

constitutional law that one should never see a denial of a

23

petition for certiorari as having any kind of a significance on

24

the merits? but perhaps when — perhaps that5s the best thing

25

that the Government could cite for this proposition? so they
50

i

cited it

z

Q

3

A

Wlii cli eziss is tfiat?
Ism referring, Mr. Justice White, to the

4

footnote on page 22 of the Government’s brief where Mora v.

5

McNamara, an order of this Court denying certiorari is pre­

6

sumably cited in favor of the proposition that what the
I

7

Government regards as nonjustiaiabXe controversies of a

8

political nature should not properly be brought before the

9

Court.

10

The — it seems as we read the Greene case, the

11

requirement of explicit authorisation before there may be a

12

tampering with fundamental constitutional rights, is so clear

13

that it is hard to see what the Government is belaboring,

14

except that one must identify what appears to be a complete

13

nimble effort on the part of the Governraont to read the Greene

10

case to stand for its opposite.

17

}

The Government seems to read the Greene case as

18

saying that purposeful inaction means the same thing m actione

19

It seems quite clear to me from anybody who reads it, that the

20

Greene case specifically said 'that mere acquiescence or in­

21

action: is sufficient— is insufficient; that Congress must

22

specifically authorize a departure from a fundamental constitu­

23

tional right.

24

Now, the Government mentions Hanna against Larche

23

which was, of course, this Court's decision, split 5 to 4 on
51

1

the amount of due process which was available to witnesses

z

before the Civil Rights Commission.

3

the decision in Hanna against larche is completely different

4

from that which we have here®

Now, it seems to me that

In Hanna against Larche, there was indeed ~ there

5
6

were indeed, two proposals before Congress? two complete

7

proposals? one which provided for a greater measure of due

8

process and another which provided for a lesser measure of

9

due processc

10

And both, interestingly, provided for-rights of

counsel, but to different extents»
And the legislative history of Hanna against Larche

11
12

is clearly revealed by the majority decision of 'this Court*

13

and the legislative history of the Civil Rights Commission,

14

indicated that Congress explicitly selected one of these

IS

schemes and specifically rejected the other scheme»
The ultimate of Congressional acquiescence has ~

16

17

was not followed in this Court in Greene? not followed in this

?8

Court in Tussy(7), a selective service matter»

19

involving selective service administration last year, last

20

term.

21

The matter

Now, the Government finally argues about ‘the

22

legislative history of the 1967 Act»

It appears to us as we

23

read the same legislative history that it means a great deal

24

other than what the Government says it means.

25

were extensive hearings.

Of course there

As we recall, and if the Court may
52

k

well ‘take judicial notices, these hearings were essentially

2

about student deferrments, about the lottery, about occupa­

3

tional deferments.

4

selective service procedures? very little attention was given

3

to conscientious objection.

6

Very little attention was given to

The Government argues, points to the testimony

7

given by General H®rsh©y in an interim report which was pre­

Q

pared, but as we point out in our brief, the House Armed

3

Services Committe© expressly disclaimed that it was any

10

reflection of General Hersheyss views, as indeed it might, for

11

General Hershey distinguished himself at these hearings by

12

making the statement that he was opposed to any amendments to

13

'the law because, and I quotes "You can do almost anything under

14

this law, which is more than you can say for a great many laws

15

that are on the books."

16

I can understand the House Armed Services Committee

17

wishing to disassociate itself with that sentiment.

18

debates are not any more helpful.

19

when he says that there was debate on the Floor of the House

20

concerning counsel*at local boards.

21

My learned friend was wrong

The proposal xaada by Congressman Kastenmeier was

22

exclusively confined to appeal boards.

23

at all on the Floor of the House about local boards.

24
25

The Floor

There was no discussion

It is true, indeed, that the Morse Amendment was
entered on the Floor of the Senate, but it is quite clear, I
53

1

believe, as we pointed out in our brief, that Senator Morse,

£

who raised the question and Senator Russell, the Chairman of

3

the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other Senators who
\

4

participated in the debate, were, and I must say this with

5

all respect, acting upon complete misinformation as to what

6

was involved.

7

brief, that Senator Russell, Chairman of the Senate Committee,

8

to the demands of military service that it just be properly

among the decisions on this question in the lower courts?
A

There are — the short answer to your

9

question is "yes," Mr, Justice Harlan, but I must observe,

10

that, as wa cite in ray brief, there are about half a dozen

11

decisions of judges who have indicated great discomfort with

12

the denial of counsel and quite clearly indicated how it pro­

13
14

duces injustice in many cases,

I refer to many decisions by

Di^rict Judges and a few decisions by Courts of Appeals.

15

The — it is by its nature an adversary proceeding,

m

because if one had gone no further than to recall the language

n

of Mr, Justice

10

we quote on page 42 of our brief, that even in the case where

19

the determination must be made as to which of two carriers

20

would get a more favorable rate.

21

is adversary in substance if it may result in an order in

22
23
24
25

Brandeis in the Abilene Railroad case, which

I quotes "Every proceeding

favor of one carrier as against another one.”
Obviously, in favor of one registrant as against
another one.
Q

Well, who is your adversary here?
56

A

There are two ways of responding to that

questions Mr, Justice Marshall,

One can indeed say that the

local board and the power Which it represents is adversary to
•tile

young man,
Q

Well, then, why don’t yon object if the

prosecutor and jury am judge are all the same,

You don’t

argue that.
A

Because, Mr, Justice Marshall ~

Q

Because you can’t,

A

There is a difference between the administra­

tive process and the judicial process,
Q

Because you can’t,

A

I can't and I wouldn't.

Q

Well, theonly people there are the board, the

clerk arid the man.

So, it's got to be the clerk or the board.-

in order for you to get your adversary.

You put so much

weight on this adversary proceeding,
A

Well, 19m suggesting, Mr, Justice Marshall,

that as viewed by Mr, Justice Brandeis in the Abilene Railroad
case, that is only one way of determining whether something is
adversary or not.

That, wherever a choice must be made between

two contestants as to who gets the benefits and who gets the
burden, that is an adversary proceeding,
Q

Well, that's why I am trying to find who are

are the two contestants?

Iem just using your

X3m trying to find out who's the other on@.
A

I suggest that the contestant is any other

5

young man who may get that particular deferment and any other

6

young man ttfho may be called if that deferment is granted.
Q

7

But he isn't there,

and that would be the

8

negation of the adversary contest, to treat as a party someone

9

who isn't there.
A

10

At the time that -- if the rule for which we

11

are contending is adopted, then at the time that he receives

12

his 1-A classification, preliminary to an order to report for

13

induction, he will have an opportunity to have a personal

14

appearance and to indicate the grounds for his contest and to

15

have the opportunity for a meaningful hearing.
Q

16

But, Justice Brandeis was talking about the

17

tripod situation where you had two contending parties and a

18

tryer.

19

concerned about the same thing.

20

parties and the tryer, the three legs on the stool?

Here you do not have, or I -think Justice Marshall is

21

Where are the two contending

I am saying that the philosophy of it, as I

22

read the Abilene case, is that wherever a benefit may be

23

bestowed upon one person rather than another,, that even if that

24

person is not before the tribunal he is in an adversary

25

pos fcure„

58

✓

i

Q

But the Congress in both Houses, filled with

2

a great many lawyers, Mr. Karpatkin, and certainly when they

3

drafted this, didn’t see it as an adversary proceeding in that

4

sense, did they?

5

6
.7

A

It would not appear to have been when it was

drafted in 1940 and the regulations that we have are still the
harbingers from the 1940 statute, but a great deal has hap­

8

pened in the ©volution of standards of administrative due

9

process, as a result of the decisions of this Court and of

10

other courts since then*

11

And this also answers why there have been a large

12

number of District Court and Court of Appeals decisions, all

13

of which we seek to distinguish in our brief, particularly in

14

the early days, which almost started as an ipse dixit,

15

of course there is no right to counsel? who would everthink of

16

it?

that

17

But, under the rulings of this Court in Goldberg

18

against Kelly, in in re Gault and in a number of decisions

19

which we cite in our brief, it seems to me that there is an

20

emerging recognition of the fact that whenever any person's

21

private or property rights may be subjected to any deprivation,

22

may be subjected to apy loss, raay have any baleful effect upon

23

them, that there is a right to a hearing, to a meaningful hear-

24

ing and that an essence of a meaningful hearing is the right to

25

be heard and the right to be heard with counsel»
59

2

And I don't know that it's necessary to rehearse
the catalogue of decisions where that isn't held,

We set forth in our brief a long -- a discussion of

the various possible classifications and a various possible

That is correct, Mr» Justice Stewart,

Q

Well, it is no doubt a circular reason, but

I8m sure that's the answer to what my question is going to
suggest?

if the Selective Service in creating this right by
61

!

statute^ had considered anything like the adversary hearing

2

that you are, in your submission there, saying that it is, it

3

would follow, of course, that it couldn’t possibly have promul­

4

gated the regulation in issue; could it?

5

A

1 guess it's not the —

6

Q

You guess the answer is that circular

A

Yes, sir; and also is not the first set of

Q

9

reasoning?

regulations which betray inconsistencies.

On the one hand the

m

regulation talks about oaths and witnesses and adversaries and

ii

subpoenas and jurisdictions and on the other hand, the regula­

12

tion says no counsel.

13

Now, this doesn’t take us to the special, what I

14

call the "special mythology” of selective service.

We had a

IS

little project in my office this summer; with the assistance of

16

a number of law students, we presumed to read the statutes and

17

the regulations governing every Federal administrative agency

10

searching for similar regulations dealing with right of counsel,

19

and our findings are revealed in our brief.

20
21

22
23
24
25

We found some 36 agencies which expressly provide
for the right of counsel, either by statute or regulation.

We

did not find a single other agency in the Federal system, with
the exception of the Selective Service System, where, either by
statute or regulation, there was an express prohibition o£
counsel under any circumstances.
62

Now , it seems to ms that there has to be some

1

2

better argument for sustaining this "everybody is out of step

3

except selective service" argument*

4

notion that it's just little groups of neighbors sitting around

5

the general store and deciding what3s best for neighbor John's

6

son*

Other than the quaint

Now, the fact is that a whole series of cases in

7
0

the District Court and one in this Court, where, unfortunately,

9

certiorari was denied, have presented very, very strong proof

10

that many of the local board members do not reside in their

I!

district*

12

this avalanche of cases has been simply to amend the regulation

13

to rescind the regulation requiring local board members, where-

14

ever practicable to reside within the geographical jurisdiction

15

of their board*

And the response by the Selective Service System to

the regulations could foe amended so as to eliminate any personal

appearance at all?

Do I understand you to concede that administratively

Oh, no, Mr* Chief Justice? if I conceded that,

No, indeed

Well, then, of necessity you are suggesting

that when the administrative regulations were promulgated,the

I would not, in truth, say that that was the

which deal with collective conscientious objection and represen­
tation of registrants by counsel.

It is our hope that should

changes be made by the Court in either of these areas* you will
be able to help us meet the resulting challenges.
Though hardly an enthusiastic endorsement of my
