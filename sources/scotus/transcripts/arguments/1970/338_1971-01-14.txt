ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II» RIMES , ESQ

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7
3
9

MR. ROBERT H. RINES, ESQ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court.
I’d like to take one moment to introduce my father,

10

teacher, and partner, Mr. David Rines,' my co-counsel from Chi­

1!

cago, Mr. Richard Phillips.

12

This case involves a conflict of decisions between the

13

Eighth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, with regard to the valid­

14

ity of a patent to Isbell, dealing with television antennas. The

15

type I'm sure Your Honors have seen cluttering the landscape

IQ

of our rooves of houses, which are very necessary in order to

17

get good television reception in the homes.

18

I have here, a typical antenna of the type I'm sure

19

you've seen on the rooves, involving what we call dipoles. There

20

is nothing magical about that; just little rods which are tuned

21

and corrected £n terms of dimension and direction to tecieve

22

from the television transmitting stations the signals that we

23

tune into on our television.

24
25

In the Eighth Circuit, both the District Court and the
Court of Appeals found the Isbell patent, which is owned by the

3

1

2

University of Illinois Foundation, to be invalid, for.obvious
ness, in the light of the teaching of the prior art.

3

The University of Illinois Foundation filed not just one

4

suit, in the winegard case, which is this Eighth circuit case,

5

but filed a suit against Blonder-Tongue, a New Jersey Corpor­

S

ation , in Chicago, by suing the customer, enjoining Blonder-

7

Tongue, and a whole host of other manufactures throughout the

8

land.

9

When the decision v?ent again t them in the Winegard District

10

Court, and while they were appealing to the Court of Appeals of

11

the Eighth Circuit, the University, of Illinois Foundation pur­

12

sued the suit against Blonder-Tongue in New Jersey, exactly the

13

tame patent. There was also another patent involved. And we went

14

to trial before Judge jpffman.
One of the issues in our presentation is the fact that we

15
16

were forced to this trial, without the benefit of a single

17

witness during the whole presentation of the University of

18

Illinois' case in chief. As a resul

19

were ready on December 18, the trial date, with our Cambridge,

20

Massachusetts expert who had worked over a year on this with us,

21

with Mr. Blonder, with various other customer witmesses from

22

all over the country, and myself from Boston, the Judge could

23

not hear it on the 18th, and he couldn't set a time for post­

24

ponement .

of that fact, when we

The nineteenth, twentieth, twenty first, we still didn't

25
2

4

1

I

have a trial date» The result was that the day before Christmas,

2

the trial was set for two days after Christmas» And I was not

3

able to reassemle any of my 'witnesses. And the District Court

4

refused to give me a few days in which to do this , but they

5

forced us to go to trial without any witnesses at all»

S

Therefore, we were not able to produce any live witnesses,

7

on the Issue of whether or not the Isbell patent was or was not

8

valid for obviousness

9
10

any other reason»

Q

The trialoriginally was set for October or November,

A

Well, it had been set several times, but was then post

then?

11

12

03:

poned, Mr. Justice Harlan.»

13

Q

And this-—

14

A

Till Devember 18th.

15

Q

What caused the postponements?

16

A

The prior trial of Judge Hoffman had not been finished

17

Q

I beg your pardon?

18

A

The prior trial that the District Court had, had not

19

been finished.

20

Q

Yes.

21

A

So it was postponed until December 18th.

22

Q

Just one continuance?

23

A

Oh, no, there were several during, at the request of

24

the parties, at the requist of the Court. This is about the

25

sixth or seventh postponement. But we8re all seroed in for Dec3
5

1

ember 18th.They5re all there»

2

Therefore the record that has been produced in this ease,,

3

is only the documents that we were able to put in before Judge

4

Hoffman which were the same documents before the District Court,

5

i.V the Eighth Circuit litigation, the Winegard litigation»

S

And we had to argue, therefore, from those documents, with­

7

out the benefit of any expert or any witnesses at all, these

8

issues of obviousness and validity»

9

Q

You had oral testimony?

10

A

Yes there was, the other side, the Defendant had a

11

right and did produce an expert and the Court—-

12

Q

Did you—

13

A

I wasn't in that»

14

Q

Oh that's right.

15

A

No, I'm a different Defendant.

16

0

That's right. You— the Defendant there did, yes.

17

A

Yes, he did.

18

So the issue squarely before this Court is, who is right,

19

in terms of this conclusion of obviousness on substantially the

20

same record? The Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, or the

21

Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit? And under the document

22

of Triplett v. Lowell, to which we will addeess ourselves also,

23

if you will recall, when a conflict does arise because a a pat­

24

entee has a second bite of a thigh, if he loses in the First

25

Circuit, the desision must rest with this Supreme Court, as to

'

4
6

1

whether the patent is valid or invalide,
\
f.

1

Q,

!

You said, I thought, that on this same record was the

3

District Court in the first case in the Eighth Circuit, dealing

4

with the same record as the record in the second trial before

5

Judge Hoffman?
*

6

A

So far as the documents are concerned,—

7

Q

Well, not™—”

0

A

But he had more evidence in the Eighth Circuit because

9

they had live witnesses and experts which we were not able to

10

produce before Judge Hoffman» So a fuller trial was held in the

11

Eighth Circuit, than we had in the Seventh Circuit»

12

Q

13

of the work?

14

A

15

In addition, in——

18

Q

17
18

So that it is not the same record in the broad sense

No, it is not, Mr* cJueiics,

.. -

You're not asking for Triplett to be overrulled?
A

No, I'jsn not»

^maintain that my brother here did have a right if there

19

was a genuine new issse or some other interpretation of the

20

claim or some interpretation of law in another circuit that's

21

different than this eircuit, he had a right to try, under Trip­

22

lett below, in another circuit*

23
24
23

In this particular1 case, where $e“re stuck with substantiallytthe same documentary evidence, where we were not able
to produce even that modicum of expert testimony that existed

7

1

in the Eighth Circuit* we think there may be as suggested

2

theSolicitor General* some reason for modification of that

3

document in a - case such as this.

by

4

The real question that is before this Court is* on the

5

matter of obviousness* at the time that Mr» Isbell made his in­

S

vention, what was the knowledge in the art? Miat was the skill

7

of the ordinary mechanic? What had been known?
And we are very fortunate that one distinction befcvfaen

8
9

these two trials

was that the University of Illinois this time

10

in the Blonder-Tongua case chose to take in some fire-inves­

11

tigators in this field, namely Dr. DuKamel, who had pioneered

12

this kind of antenna at the University of Illinois many years

13

before.
He was produced as the Plaintiffs witness, and fortunately

‘14

15

through cross-examination

16

admissions that we think bolsters this concept of complete un­

17

obviousness of this invention at the time that Mr» Isbell, made

18

it»

19

Now the District-- *

20

Q

21

I4r. Rines, I want to be sure the so-called Mayes

patent is not an issue not—

22

A

23

Q—here.

24

A

25

we were able to get from Mr, DuHarael

It is not.

For the edification of the Court, there were two pat­

ents sued on by the University of Illinois. One was the Isbell
6
8

1

patent, which is this kind of an antenna, not this, where these

2

rods, here, instead of being off at an angle, come out straight»

3

That8s Isbello

4

Then they had a second patent? the Mayes, who just took

5

these rods and bent them in this way into a V» The District

6

Court found both those patents valid» The Court of Appeals

7

threw

8

an issue in this Supreme Court» Not here»

. out the V “-patent., saying it wasn't valid. So that's not

9

’However, one issue that is involved is that fet the time

10

they obtained this Mayes patent from the Patent Office, counsel,

11

who were prosecuting both the Isbell and the Mayes patents to­

12

gether, filed an affadavit in the Patent Office, which we main­

13

tained was fraudelent, as a result of which

14

this Mayes patent

issued»

15

That affadavit concerned both inventions, bothtP© Isbell

16

patent and the Mayes patent inventions» And one of our contention

17

is that the Court of Appeals having reversed Jusge Hoffman, and

18

found that this affadavit was less than candid. And it was de­

19

liberately gisen to mislead the Patent Office, that one of the

20

questions we raise is that under those circumstances, there
■ .*-■

21

should be any standing in equity on either patents for the Plain

22

tiff.
And also involved in our case is the fact that the minutes

23
24

that the fruit of this fraud were obtained, out in the market­

25

place they went, with copious advertisements, telling the whole
7
9

1

world they9d invented the broad, log-periodic antenna, nobody

2

else could make one, and this coupled with a whole series of

3

other acts almost put our client out of business»

4

So that we have a counter-claim, which is in point 2, if

5

you will, question number 4 before this Court, as to whether

6

this is fair competition, whether this has not violated the

7

anti-trust laws-, to take the fruits of an illegally obtained

8

patent and use it the way it was used in the marketplace, and

9

to supress competition»

10

Turning back for the moment, to the obviousness of the

11

Isbell patent, at the time that Isbell made his invention, this

12

whole magic of log-periodicity had been invented long since, as

13

Judge Hoffman found. In the early 1950’s at the University of

14

Illinois. It’s very simple.

15

What it means is that in order to have your television

16

antenna

listen to all of the channels, from the low frequencies

17

to the high frequencies, we put in a whole bunch of these an­

18

tennas, and we tune them to different* frequencies. And if you

19

shape them in the way that they go from the long wavelengths

20

down to the short wavelengths, just taper their shape, that’s'

21

a logarithmic variation. That’s all it means.
And if you space it also, in accordance with the length,

22
23

that again is a logarithmic variation. Those principles, and

24

that discovery, we all admit was known before Isbell came into

25

the scene. What, then, did Isbell claim was his invention?
8
10

!

Ah hay he said, Other people, while they had done that

2

variation of having long, shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter,

3

while they had done that before, they didnet do it with a simpl

4

single wire. They did it "with what he calls teeth. See, these

5

are little triangular teeth, and they didn't take, and just

0

use one wire instead of the tooth.

7

So this is supposedly what Mr, Isbell invented.

8

But when Mr, Harris, their expert, got on the stand, he

9

admitted to us, as shown in the record here, that the idea of

10

these teeth, or straight lines, or folded lines, these are all

11

well-known dipoles, all well known antennas, and in fact they

12

all operate the same way to produce the same result,

13

I would like to hold up for you from Appendix, Volume II,

14

if I may, page 475, the sketches that their witness, Mr, Harris

15

pufc on the board, and which we transcribed on to paper, 475, and

16

476, where he shows, if Your Honors please, first, these strafeghi:

17

lines. The straight-line-dipole, so called, of Isbell.

18

And up above it he shows what the current is, this loop-

19

dash line, that means that radio currents go across the antenna

20

in that kind of a distribution.
Than onthe next page, Mr. Harris, their expert, sketches

21

22

these triangular loops I just showed to you, in Item 6. And he

23

shows the same curreet distribution. And below that he shows

24

that you coild fold the wire into a rectangular loop and get

25

the same current distributi.on.
9

U

?

,And there’s no dispu-.e but thaffc all these antennas ware

2

known long before Isbell» Decades, So that the question resolves

3

itself into can you give as many parents as there are well known

4

types of shapes, by just magically putting them in this old

S

fosmula for log-periodicity?

6

And this is what the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circui

7

found to answer in the negative ,but this is what Judge Hoffman

8

answered in the affirmative. Now, wlhy?

9

Judge Hoffman was impressed by Mr, DuHaxnels testimony.

10

He was surprised that these straight line elements would work.

11

Though, he said, a£ter he thought aibout it he realised they

12

would.
But when was he surprised? The;re' s absolutely nothing in

13
14

this record showing that it was not. obvious at the time Mr.

15

Isbell proposed to change from a fi.xed antenna to a thin wire

16

that it was not obvious. And Judge Hoffman did not find that it

17

was not obvious at the time Isbell made the invention, he just

18

said at some time, he was not predi.ctible, whether these

19

different kinds of things would work.

20

But the statute says, we’re concerned in Section 103,

21

that obviousness at the time of the invention. And fortunately

22

we were able to put in a document w/hich was contemporary with

23

Mr. Isbells invention. A document of the University of Illinois

24

laboratory itself. Where, as wa quote in our brief, and we'ge

25

reproduced it,

(it’s only two pages long), in the first part

10

12

1

they say, Wow we can predict from the mathematics, the operatior

2

of multi-element Xog-peridic antennas, and then in the lower

3

paragraph it says Mr. Isbell is going to thin these down, now,

4

into

3

zero width, almost, little wires.
And that document itself, contemporaneous, not in anfcipation

6

of any lawsuits shows beyond any reasonable doubt, even if this

7

were a criminal test, 'that at that time,it was completely ob­

8

vious to those shilled in the art, that Isbells trivial change

9

was an experiment, but was not something that was unobvious to

10

those skilled in tte art.

11

Q

Mr. Rines, you keep referring to what the Eighth Cir­

12

cuit found, to bring it up for my recollection, -do you recall

13

who tried it in the District Court, and whether invalididty

14

was the result in the District Court also?

15

A

Yes, it was * This was tried before Judge Stevenson,

16

and Judge Stevenson found what I have just told you. The Court

17

of Appeals sustained it.

18

0

In

the southern district of Iowa., then.

19

A

Excuse

20

Q

In

the southern district of Ipwa.

21

A

In

the southern district of Iowa, all right.

22

Q

me?

Let's assume that the result of an experiment is not

23

obvious. I mean it isn't predictible. But the experiment .itself

24

is obvious. I mean if you want to* know what the resulta are goinc

25

to be, at least there are plenty of indications of what kind of

U
13

!

an experiment you want to run,

2

A

You8re absolutely right, Mr. Justice Black.

3

Q

Now, I don't suppose unpredictibility in those"--

4

A

It8 s not synonimous with obviousness, but you see,

5

Judge Hoffman, we believe, fell into the error of making it syn-

S

onimous with obviousness„ And his grounds were since it was

7

unpredictible, I therefore think it's linobvious.
Now the Court of Appeals in the Eighth Circuit said no,

8
9

that's not the test. It's obviousness, not predictibility. They

10

said if it would be obvious to a skilled person what to try,

11

even if you don't know everything thet’s going to happen once

12

you try it,, if you9d be led by the prior art to try this thing,

13

then that is not obvious because it was unpredictible.
Is there a pretty good law on that, in other cases?

14

q

15

A

I haven't found it.

16

Q ■

That’s what I thought.

17

A

The brief of the American Patent Law Association is

18

pleading with this Court, and I think we do, too, to stick to

19

Graham vs. Deere, and these other cases, where you have set

20

forth sensible tests, as to how do you determine obviousness.

21

You look at the scope of the prior art, you look at the claims,

22

you compare the difference, you look at the skill of the man at

23

that time.

24

Now we feel that this predictibility issue comes in in that

25

skill. Now would a man really have said, sure, try that, we know
12
14

1

'it8s going to work,, somehow. Even though I can't tell you ex­

2

actly what the outcome is. So we feel obviousness should be the

3

testy and there isn't much law confusing the two that we've

4

been able to find.
Reaching, then, our conclusion, that on a much better re­

5
6

cord, and with an opportunity of trial and expert testimony,

7

the Eighth Circuit reached the conclusion of obviousness and

Q

realizing that Judge Hoffman confused predictibility and ob­

9

viousness, and at that his confusion went to Hr. DuHamel talking

10

about certain esoteric structures, that weren't obvious.
He didn't say

11

making these particular little elements

12

wasn't obvious. Oh, no. Let me show you the testimony that he

13

talked about when he spoke on obviousness.
Pages 412 of Volume II of the Appendix. Look at it. See

14

IS

this big conical structure, this sweeping fold going up into the

16

air? On page 413 this zig-zag configuration? This vertical thing

17

going up with all kinds of lumps on it? Ehis is the testimony

18

of Ds. DuHamel. These were the things he put into evidence to

19

convince; the District Court it wasn't prredictible at all that

20

dipole elements could be shaped from the log-periodic and

21

come out right.
But he did not say that really to take a prior fi^ed an­

22
23

tenna and make one wire of it wasn't obvious. Now in his cross-

24

examination, Dr. DuHamel, witmess for the University of Illinois

25

admitted that what I hold in my hand here which is Defendants1'
13
15

1

Exhibit 24j, is a correct representation of what he described in

2

his prior patent, prior to Isbell. Xt8s prior art.

3

If you311 notice, he has antenna dipoles that vary in length

4

as we go down from long and shsrt , and spacings that vary in

3

long and short. The so-called log-periodic spacing.

0

This, believe it or not, is one of the Blonder-Tonge in­

7

fringements. And what is the difference, superficially? Instead

a

fcf having triangles, we have straight lines. If this was prior

9

art, could the

Isbell patent possibly be valid if it covers
/

10

this, another equally well-known type of dipole? Just taking and

1?

fitting these triangular loops into single wires.

12

We think the'question answers itself.

13

We come now, to summarize other points with regard to the

14

invalidity of the Isbell patent and the non-infringement there­

15

of. Every claim of the Isbell patent is restricted to the idea

16

of putting these antennas as close as you can in one plane. So-

17

called co-planar. Judge Hoffman read out of the claims the word

18

co-planar. And found that a Blonder-Tonge antenna, which is

19

their principal ones, which had dipoles deliberately in two

20

widely spaced planes, which is the Blonder patent, not the Ishel.

21

patent. He found that that is all in the same plane. He doesn't

22

explain why.he found it all in the same plane.
And hence he found the Isbell claims, co-planar claims, to

23
24

be infringed by this antenna. When we came to the Court of Ap­

25

peals they apparently couldn’t stomach that. And so they made
14
16

1

their own suppositions, they said apparently, and all they were

2

looking at was this antenna, at the time, apparently, they said,

3

you can't physically build these two sets of antenna’s to get them

4

exactly in the same plane. So there has to be some separation

5

about the order of an inch.
Hence, they said, we think co-planar applies to the Blonder-

Tongue antennas,

" - <“•••

When we called to their attention that the real antennas

3

i

9

of Blonder-Tongue are four incheas apart, and that it has ao5

10

thing to do with how close you can put these things together,

11

we can. put. them together much closer, mechanically, but it’s

12

an entirely different purpose, they just took the one inch re­

13

ference out of their decision, but let it sfcand that that is

14

co-planar»
We submit that any such extension of a monopoly of a patent

15
16

completely beyond the file history, completely beyond anything

17

they ever asked for, to strip the word co-planar out of the

18

claims and to hold a new inventor to be infringing when he isn't

19

co-planar and doesn't even do the same thing is improper—

20

Q

What patent is that?

21

A

This is the Blonder-Schenfeld patent in our counter­

22

claim»

23

Q

What's the other patent?

24

A

The Isbell patent»

25

Q

That he just picked up?

15
17

1
2

A

No, this is also made in accordance with the Blonder-

Tongue patents»

3

Q

That8s right.

4

A

No, these are in two different planes.

5

Q

Do you have the Isbell patent there?

6

A

We don't, have the structure of it* as a model, but

7

what it is, Your Honor, is instead of haveig these two tubes

8

this widely spaced apart, Isbell put them absolutely close to­

9

gether, as shown in his patent, almost toughing. So that they

10

could all be in the same plane.

11

Q

12

A

13

Is that supposed to be the invention?
. Yes, Your Honor. They stress this throughout the pa­

tent. They must be in the same plane. And the reason—
i
q:
---closer together?
r

14
‘15

A

Very close together. As close as you can get it.

16

Q

And that's their whole claim?

17

A

That's their whole claim. Co-planar antennas in one

18

plane shaped for these wires in this tapered shape, logarithmic

19

shape we're talking about—Q

20
21

Does the shape have anything to do with it, ®r is it

the closeness together?

22

A

No. There are two requirements, Mr. Justice Black.

23

The first requirement is, that everything be in the same

24

plane. The second requirement is that the linghts of these

25

antennas taper, such as 19 ve shown to you, and the spacings tape.:.
16
18

1

Put those three things together and that's Isbells socalled invention,

3
4

Q

And what's the difference between that and the other

So far as Blonder-Tongue is concerned, it deliberately

one?

took the antennas out of the same plane and spaced them a slight

The physical thing they have is antennas all in one

5

Q

All right»

6

A

That’s the way they built ituntil Blonder came and

7

showed they way. They didn't leave it all in one plane» And

8

this was such a remarkable concept, that you could move the

9

planes and still get log periodicity, that the Patent Office

10

granted us a patent for it»
It was a highly smobvious thing„ we maintained, from all

it
12

the training before, that everybody tried to get it all in the

13

same plane,

14

Q

Well, then*——

15

A

Maybe obvious to one skilled in the art, I’m not goung

16

to pretend that we’ve got the worlds greatest patent, all I

17

say is. this Court ought to guarantee ous? right to trial, and

down rules in Graham vs. Deere that the District Court is sup­

23

posed to follow.
You said make this finding. Make this finding. We have it

Q

A

Oh, yes.- he8s a pioneer compared to us.

4

Q

And I understood you to say in response to Mr. Justice

5

Mr. Rines, did Isbells patent antiquate yours?

White, that if their patent is valid, yours has infringed it.

6

A

If you take this idea of co-planar, and say Iem going

7

to read it out of the plan, so that it reads whether the di­

8

poles are in the same plane or widely separated, we infringe.

9

But if you read co-planar in Isbells patent, we don't in­

10

fringe. We deliberately got away From putting them in the same

II

plane. Does that make that clear?
Q

'12

Well, I thought that just a moment ago you had made

13

a concession that seemed to me to be an important one, and that

14

would take with it a concession of invalidity of your .patent,

15

assuming theirs was valid.

16

A

If I said that, I donst mean it that way.

17

Q

All right.

IS

A

1 was saying it. in a context if we read out of the

'19

claim co-planar, and we give it no limitation in the Isbell

20

claim, so that things can be in the same plane or different

21

planes, if you took that out we infringe Isbells patent.

22

But that is n't Isbells patent,

issue?

6

q

1

myself to in connection with the Isbell situation is that there

8

was a publication completely describing Isbells patent that

9

was put in a local library more than one year before the filing

10

Are you going to address yourself to the publication

A

Yes, I am. The last

concept that I want to address

of that patent application.
The District Court disputed whether or not it was a real

11

library. The Court of Appeals recognised that it was a library

Miss Johnsons operation. And again, the Supreme Court

has never passed on this point,, so far as vi?e can rind, the lower
court decisions. But we have followed that line of cases that
says if you put it in a library, even a small library, *-his
constitutes your intention to make it public, an^ the mere facx.
that nobody came to that library to draw out the copy is im­
material .
Q

23

25

it a library——

Where is that document?
In the University of Illinios, antenna section, they

have a library of antenna publications where people come and

21
23

1

draw these things out,, And the librarian so testified.

2
3

Q

How would you characterize the laws which exist in

the lower court as to what the standard of publication is?

4

A

Well Judge Hoffman characterized them for me. He said

5

if this really was a library, and Miss Johnson were a librarian,

8

he said I’m compelled to say that this was published more than

7

a year before the patent.
And then he turned around and said but I don't think it's

3
9

a real library. It's a tiny place in the University.

10

Q

Well, what’s the heading over the door?

11

A

I beg your pardon?

12

Q

What’s the heading on the door?

13

A

It’s called E-E-L-L. Local library. And this is the

14

way it is on the distribution sheets of all the material that

IS

they send. They call it a library.
I’d like to take just a few minutes now on the matter of

16
17

what happened to us in the marketplace. Once this fraudently

13

obtaintd patent in the Patent Office same out.
The foundation andttheir licensee, then exclusive licensee,

19

20

JFD, took this patent, published copious adds, all fever the coun­

21

try, Look Magazine, we’ve put in whole copies of these, announ­

22

cing that they had patented the log-periddie formula. That
nobody else could make log-periodic antennas. Then they took

23
24

these adds out into the marketplace. They used fchesa to coerce

25

purchasers to buy only their products. Here is the University of

22
24

1

Illinois, and JFD, they had the patents, nobody else can use it,

2

if you buy Blonder-Tongue, you8re going to be in"trouble, we're

3

going to sue you., And they did that, they sued everybody.

4

We maintain that vie have offered some evidence of tie-in

5

sales, that the District Court said was some evidence„ We offered

0

evidence of raiding, where in the heat of the ligitation they

7

took away our employees who ‘were investigating their activities.

8

And with them dissappeared all the records. How am I going to

9

proove my case? Where just before the trial they hired away our

10

co-inventor, of our own patent in suit, so that I couldn't use

11

his testimony on the matter of infringement.

12

13

Despite all of these things,we did, through depositions,
get into the record something that the District Court coneeeded.

14

They patent mismarked. The District Court said that's di-

15

minimous, though. They put in these adds I told you about say­

IS

ing nobody else could make an antenna, that they found.

17

They not only raided ours but in the marketplace they actu­

18

ally told people, we have evidence of this, not the strongest,

19

but it's in the record, that if they bought any of Blonder-

20

Tongues line they wouldn't sell them. Their patented antennas.

2!

And we maintain the District Court in picking all of these

22

little things and saying well, you haven't prooved this enough,

23

didn't follow the law in looking at the totality of all these

24

acts, which we think was a serious anti-trust and unfair

tition violation, because it all stemmed from this fr&udently

Q

ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. MCLAREN, ESQ„

10

AS AMICUS CURAIE

11

MR. McLARENs Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

12

3

Mr o McLaren?

Court o
The United States appears as amicus in this matter

14
15

today, soley on the question of whether or not or to what extent

16

the Court should continue to adhere to the doctrine of Triplett

17

v. Lowell.
What Triplett held is that a determination of invalid­

18
19

ity of a patent in a suit against one defendant does not preclude

20

another suit upon the same claims against another defendant.
The holding was on the ground of the common law re­

21

22

quirement of mutuality of estoppel. That is no one can take ad­

23

vantage of another judgement unless he would also be bound by

24

it.
Not the governments interest in this matter is on three

25
24

2^

1

grounds» The government is a very frequent party in patent li­

2

tigation , the government has serious responsibilities both for

3

conducting and administering the patent system and for the

4

enforcing of the anti-trust laws and of course the government

S

has a great interest in the courts and in the fair and efficient

6

administration of justice.

7

Now if I may at the outset, I would like to summarise

8

our views and our position and then to discuss the arguments

9

for and against the mutuality requirement»

10

In the last, approximately 30 years, the strict doc-

11

trime of mutuality of estoppel has eroded very substantially

12

both in the Federal courts, on federal questions, as well as in

13

the State courts until now, I think it's fair to say, it is no

14

longer the majority rule in the general Federal law, on Federal

15

questions, or in our most populous states»

16

As a matter of fact one New York Court of Appeals

17

judge, not too long ago, called mutuality a dead letter, under

18

the New York law» However, in the patent field, the lower courts

19

have felt bound to follow the doctrine of Triplett v. Lowell,

20

and they have adhered to the mutuality rule, saying from tim&

21

to time, that it was up to this Court, or to the Congress, to

22

make any change in the rule. This happened, for example in this

23

very case in the opinion of the Seventh Circuit below. It quest­

24

ioned the soundness of the rule but indicated it had to follow

25

it. It happened a short time ago in the case of Nickerson v„
Kutschera, 25
27

1

Kutschera, in the Third Circuit where the Court, of Appeals re­

2

luctantly followed Triplett, reversing the Delaware District

3

Court and indicating its agreement that there should have been

4

an estoppel.
Mow we do not suggest abandoning the rigid, strict mu­

5

6

tuality estoppel rule only to replace it with another strict

7

kind of rule such as for example, in rem invalidity, which ap­

8

pare itly is the fear of the Patent Bar,
Instead what we suggest is a loosening of the Triplett

9
10

rule to permit pleading and consideration of a prior invalidity

11

judgement as defense matter» The language of Triplett expressly

12

holds, expressly prohibits the pleading of a prior judgement in

13

so many words. We think that should not be. We would let the

14

courts' consider unilateral estoppel, if you will, and consider

15
16
17

..

.

such claims on a case by case basis, giving due weight and re­
gard to any fac tors that would point to unfairness, oi to anamolous result by application of the estoppel doctrine.
Now turning to the arguments in favor or abandoning

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the mutuality tequiremfent, I think that the main argument is
that it servas no use ful purpose. This criticism, incidentally,
goes as far back as the works of Jeremy Bentham, in the middle
of the nineteenth century. Be found that mutuality served no
rational purpose and he said" It was a maxim which one would
suppose to have found its way from the gaming table to the
Bench." .
26
28

?

In more recent times, in -the

landmark Bernhard decis­

2

ion the Supreme Court of California in 1942, opinion by Mr»

3

Justice Traynor, he likewise found no rationalisation for the

4

rule. And he was unable to see, he said in the opinion,

3

the public policy values of the

6

certainty of the finality, the limiting litigation,, the judi­

7

cial economy. He could not see why these should fall before an

8

artificial requirement of mutuality.

why

res judicata doctrine the

Now he said that he might have invoked the indemnity

9
10

exception to this rule, and there are a number of exceptions,

11

in fact I think that in states still following the mutuality

12

rule it’s fair to say it."s riddled with exceptions, and the

13

Bernhard case probably.could have gone on on that ground.

14

But instead, Justice Traynor attacked the doctrine

15

himself and in particular he ^elfc that estoppel should arise

16

and should be usable by a defendant against a plaintiff who

17

had had a full opportunity to try his claim and had lost.
As the courts, both federal and state, have followed

18
19

Bernhard, one after another, it's clear that the crowded con­

20

dition of dockets and the need for judicial ecomomy had weighed

2!

heavily when the courts had considered the rather artificial

22

concept and the lack of value to mutuality oh the one hand and

23

weighed these other considerations against them.
Now specifically in the patent field, the arguments

24
23

against mutuality I think are primarily three in number. First,
27
29

1

it's argued that Triplett gives a bad patent almost as much in­

2

fluence as a good one.Businessmen accept a license, they buy a

3

royalty to buy a piece despite the fact that a patent may once

4

hace been held invalid. They do it to buy their piece.
To put it another way, the mutuality doctrine places

5
6

obstacles in the way of eliminating bad patents. I think it’s

7

fair to say that this would be contrary to the policy stated by

8

the Court in the recent Lear v. Adkins case.
Q

9

Of course, Mr. McLaren you’re making your amicus

10

in the contest of the case where the parties, both sides in this

11

case have asked us not to overrule Triplett. And I suppose res

12

judicata is a defense that could be waived, can’t it?

13

A

I would think it is,—

14

Q

Well, all I'm suggesting is that in the context

13

of the litigation where both sides are waiving it if you choose

16

to speak it, or at least the party for whose benefit the doc­

17

trine could be evoked is i*?aiving it, it9s not

18

situation in which to reconsider a decision of this Court, is

19

it?
A

20

a

very happy

Well, Mr. Justice Harlan, I think that in view

21

of the fact that petitioner does ask that the rule of the Se­

22

venth Circuit be upset that it is up to this Court to determine

23

the grounds on which it is upset and to determine what shall

24

happen in the District Court if the case is remanded. And it

25

would be our view that the matter should be remanded for the
28

"

30

'f

District Court to consider the Winegard litigation and to see

2

what additional evidence, what hardship, why the District Court

3

should not adhere to the Winegard rule»

4

X don't think that, this Court is bound by the grounds

S

which the parties assert when they come up here and invoke the

6

Court's power»
Q

7

Mr, McLaren, X understood Mr. Hines to say that

8

he thought perhaps he wasn't asking that Triplett be overruled,

9

but that there might be room for modifying it in this case, in

10

the specific circumstances of this case, to preclude re-lit-

11

igaing what the Eighth Circuit had, in the particular circum­

12

stances——

13

A

I—

14

Q

Of this case. That’s whay X understood, maybe X

A

X so understood him also, Mr. Justice White, X

15

X!m wrong.

16
17

think that this is a little different position than was taken in

18

his brief, but X think it is very close to the position that

19

take. I think also that the brief amicus of the Patent Bar As­

20

sociation is not too far from the position that we take. They

21

dont want to see a new rigid in rem invalidity kind of a law

22

established and neither do we.
We are not suggesting that there should be a one

23
24
25

shot and that is all kind of situation, we recognise some of
these arguments that are made, pro and con, we think that the
28 9
31

we

1

Court is the place, the Courts are the instrument for carrying

2

out reconsiderations of Triplett on a cautious case by case and

3

step by step basis.

4

I would advert to the considerations sat forth in

S

Rule 60 for a new trial, I think they list newly discovered

6

evidence, fraud or perjury, some sort of misconduct by the

7

other side, and then I think it winds up with the statement any

8

other matter that is necessary for fairness and justice» And

9

we wou3.d suggest a similar rule in these cases,

10

Q

In view of the position of the parties, at least

11

as taken in their briefs, what you5re suggesting we do is su

12

responde ourselves to overrule a prior decision of this Court

13

tha&fs bean on the books for this length of time, without ar­

14

gument by the parties.

15

A

I think, Mr. Justice Harlan, that the Court

16

would be warranted, at least in re-examinig that portion of

17

Triplett which says that a defendant may not plead as a defense,

18

I think it’s almost a direct quote, the fact of prior litigation
I think that the Court should follow the modern trend

19
20

in the courts, it should release the lower courts who apparently

21

feel bound to follow the Triplett rule in a rather complete

22

fashion despite their own ideas of what would be fair-—
Q

23
24

Couldn't we weigh the litigation in which that

issue is put to us by the parties?
A

25

I would think, Mr. Justice Harlan, that the sit-

30
32

1

nation in the courts, now, considering the crowded dockets, ®r

z

considering the

3

numbers some 70 e&ses in 20 districts and more than 200 defen­

4

dants, I think it would be well if the Court could see its way

5

clear to giving consideration to this matter,

fcechnigraph litigations which 1 understand now

6

Q

Has it been up in Congress?

7

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Black it was up in Congress in

8

a bill 2 years ago as a result of a recommendation of a presi­

9

dential patent commission and it was suggested at that time that

10

a kind of an in rem invalidity be adopted.
That bill was not reintroduced in the last Congress,

11

12

and the provisions in the current patent, well I guess that bill

13

has not yet been reoffered but it was in the last Congress, had

14

to do with the payment of costs and I believe Counsel fees

15
16
17

where a party had unjustifiedly brought a second or later lit­
igation, But I would say that Congress has given no indication
either or approval or of disapproval of the Triplett rule.
The Trsplett rule is, I think, part of what the

18
19

Court saw in 1936 as the general common law on the subject of

20

estoppel by judgement and I thin!? that the other parts of the

2!

law having changed, it8s appropriate for the Court to develop

22

the changes insofar as they apply in the patent field.
Q

23
24

Does theTriplett rule rest at all on statute, or

is it altogether judicially created?
A

25
31

X would say it resta altogether on what was then

?

the generally accepted common law rule, Mr» Justice Black,

2

Just to conclude,the arguments are set forth in our

3

brief in favor of overruling the mutuality doctrine, the other

4

parties, the University of Illinois particularly, some of the

5

amicus briefs, indicate the arguments in favor of the mutuality

6

doctrine. Our conclusion recognizing that there are important

7

questions raised, we think in balance that a clear case has been

8

made for reconsideration of Triplett,
It was based on the general common law wheh it was de­

9
10

cided, that law has now changed, and we do not think that Trip­

11

lett is serving us so well that it should be retained as an

12

exception to what we regard as the modern rule, and-Q

13
14

Suppose we were to agree with you, what would

be the effect on this case?
A

15

I would think, Mr, Justice Blacfc, that it would

16

be reversed, and remanded to the trial court to consider the

17

Winegard litigation and what additional evidence the University

18

of Illinois would have to offer to change that ruling. And if

19

it cannot make out a case for a further trial, make out a case

20

as to why it did not present Dr„ DuHamels testimony, for ex­

21

ample on the first trial, then I would think that the trial

22

judge should adhere to it,
Q

23
24
25

I thought your friends' request was somewhat

marrower than that? he just said that he wanted a trial. One
opportunity to try a case the way he thought it should have
32

34

i

been tried, that it, with witnesses available, I didn't under­

2

stand him to suggest that the District Court in Illinois should

3

have to gi%re any particular weight to what the District Court

4

in Iowa had done»

5

A

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that he wasreferring

6

to his counter claim that's where he said he wanted fiis

7

trial. And I think that Judge Hoffman had dismissed his counter­

8

claim on his patent without findings on the obviousness issue,

9

1 believe that’s what was referred.to.

10

Q

I'll clear that up in lis rebuttal.

1!

A

Yes, sir,

12

Q

full

Of course the Court of Appeals here, for the

13

Seventh Circuit, I'm looking at page A5 of the Appendix, I don’t

14

know what page it is in the Federal Circuit, but in any event,

15

they recognize that the, by quoting this sentence from the Trip­

16

lett opinion, they recognize that the Iowa decision should be

17

in the Eighth Circuit decision should be as a matter of comity,

18

should be paid, respected, and as they say given great weight.
I don’t quite understand what more you would want them

19
:20

to do. They did respect it, they read it, they understood it,

;2l

and then they concluded that they disagreed x*ith it.
A

22

I read that to meand that but for the Triplett

.23

rule they would have followed the Eighth Cirouit, Mrl Justice

.24

Stewart.
Q

25

Well, that’s according to how you read it, I

33
35

i

guess„

2

A

1 think they went on to cite it and another

3

justice in that circuit just a few years ago found the doctrine -

4

abhorent in light of the crowded condition of the dockets—

5

Q

l saw that quotation—-

6

A

And I venture to say that they would follow a

7

unilateral estoppel rule of the kind that we have outlined that

8

would always be subject to a fairness doctrine» We do not

9

suggest any kind of a rigid per se, or in rent rule,

Q

12

ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. MARSHALL, ESQ»

.13

Mr» Marshall?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

14

UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS FOUNDATION
MR. WILLIAM A» MARSHALL, ESQ:Mr» Chief Justice, and

15
16

may it please the Court, as I listen to Petitioners standing

17

before this Court, it sounded like he was asking for a trial

18

de novo» That isn't one of the issues that we have before this

19

Court. There were two trials on this one particular patent, the

20

Isbell patent. There x^ere concurrent findings made below by

21

not only the Eighth Circuit, but all of the Seventh Circuit

22

Court of Appeals, and we feel that this Court should go frrom

23

that particular point rather than start over and review all

24

the facts in these matters.
For example, in the concept of due process, this wasn’t

25
34

36

i

even raised as an issue in the Petition for Certor&ri. This was

2

an argument that Petitioners had brought up here, but has not

3

been raised as a point»

4

Therefore, X"m not going to pursue that because the

5

concurrent findings beloitf in the Seventh Circuit clearly held

6

that there was no fraud so far as the endeavors of the University

7

of Illinois foundation regarding the prosecution of the Mayes

8

patent.

9

I might point out, so that this Court can properly

10

review this matter in its proper perspective, the University

11

of Illinois Foundation is an arm of the University of Illinois,

12

and as such does not manufacture or sell anything» Its whole

13

function in this particular instance is the function as a lic­

14

ensing agent to license antenna manufacturers under the Isbell

15

patent or any other patents they might happen to have in their

16

portfolio.
Similarly, this question of the fraudulent affadavit,

17
18

that affadavit was made, we contend that there was nothing fraud­

19

ulent about it at all, but that affadavit was made in the pro­

20

secution of the Mayes patent, which is not even an issue here.
And from the standpoint of the courts below, they

21

22

found that there was no fraud there. The Seventh Circuit Court

23

of Appeals said that that patent was invalid on the basis of

24

obviousness, not that it was the result or the fruit of a

25

fraudulent affadavit.
35
37

1

How let me get down to what I feel is the basic issue

2

so far as why we8re up here* We, if I get a chance I'd love to

3

discuss the Triplett v. Lovell because I have a lot of good

4

points on that one, but my priccipal concern right here is the

S

question of obviousness, as equated to this concept of"obvious

6

to try" test.
You have to remember that in the end result that Sec­

7
8

tion 103 calls for the test to be on obviousness, but what we

9

say is that predictibility of a factor which goes into determin­

10

ing the question of obviousness so that you have to consider

11

the "obvious to try" test vs. the concept of predictibility as

12

it relates to the ussue of obviousness.
Hobody is so naive in the patent profession as to es­

13
14

pouse the doctrine that unpredictibility ipso facto gives you

15

an ultimate result of unobviousness. You have to consider the

16

end result that we're looking for, not the platitude. Predic­

17

tibility can be of kind, or it can be of degree.
When you talk about predictibility, predictibility

18
19

can be in terms of the routine experimentation or something

20

that is predictible to the toutint experimenter, vs. the un­

21

predictibility that afcises from a situation which a pioneer en­

22

deavor is faced with.

23

Let me illustrate the routine type of approach. That

24

was brought up in the case of Handel v. Wallace casw which was

25

before this Court, involving the incorporation of a corrosion
36

38

1

inhibitor in a deodorant,, The Court justifiedly found that

2

the incorporation of this

corrosion inhibitor into this cos-

3

rustic because it should have been perfectly apparent to any

4

routine investigator to investigate one, two, three, or four

5

corrosion inhibitors, try them in this particular under-ana de-

6

oderant environment, expect that they would work»
Therefore you have the concept of routine investigat .

7

8

tion, routine experimentation» You couldn't really predict ab-

9

solutely that this corrosion inhibitor would work, but you had

50

a reasonable expectation»
Nov; you go to the other end» This is a predictibility

II
12

of degree’ which in my opinion, and in the opinion of the So-

13

preme Court, we agree, is unpatentable»
This is a routine type of experimentation. Let’s go

14
15

and see what we had in the case of Isbell» Isbell did not have

16

this type of background prior art at all.
Q

17

You have these two pencils and you get a blurred

18

signal, and so everybody realizes that one of the problems is

19

that they're together» So you separate them until you don’t get

20

a blurred signal. Would that proove invention?
A

21

Mr. Justice, you have reduced it to the over­

22

simplification. You can't do that. That is a generalized state­

23

ment that I wouldn't even answer yes: or no because again, I

24

would have to depend on experimentation. If, by virtue of--—
Q

25

Yes —

37
39

A

1

separating these two spaced booms, there was

2

some teaching in the prior art that I was goinfe to clarify the

3

signal, it would be unpatentable,,

4

Q

I see»

5

A

On the other hand, where you have a situation

6

like we have in the instance of the Isbell patent, 1 think in

7

all due deference to Petitioner, he misstated this concept, fir.

8

Justice Black, because the invention, the Isbell invention,

9

does not merely go to the spacing of the booms.
There are many other concepts involved in that, which

IQ
11

you can see from a review of the claims. I don't want to go into

12

the claims because this is a completely complex and technical

13

approach that we could spend three hours on.
But basically, what you have in the instance of the

!4

15

Isbell invention, is complete unpredictability. this was not on­

16

ly found by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, it was fotind by

17

Judge Goffman, it was found by the Seventh Circuit Court of

18

Appeals. So for Mr. Rines or the Petitioner to say that the end

19

result was predictible, is wrong. Becuase there is a concurrent

20

finding that it was not predictible.
What we have is the instance, not of taking a bunch

21

22

of components because we have to recognise that just because

23

the claimed invention is a combination of old elements, this

24

doesn't per se make it invalid in accordance with the U.S. v.

25

Adams doctrine.

38

4q

We have a situation here where one could not know
1
2

what was going to happen„ There was no big signpost, no guidepost which says "Log periodic antennas can be made." As a matter

3
4

of fact, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Judge
Steuenson was clearly erroneous in making that finding, and

5
found that there was no technique, no principle for designing

6
log-periodic antennas.

7
What they found ®as that there is a principle of log

8
9

periodicity. But this, in and of itself, does not permit you

10

to design a log periodic antenna, only to design a log periodic

a

structure.

12

The Structures, if you will look at the Jasik hand­

13

book at page 430 of Appendix II. You don’t have to look at it

14

now, but there are a nvmber of log periodic structures that

15

were available that worked as log periodic antennas. Jasik him­

16

self says that log periodicity is unpredictible. Now what you

17

have is the dipole antennas which were bid.
You have the transmission lines for connecting the

18
19

dipole antennas, 'those were old. You have the spacing of the di­

20

poles, you have the length of the dipoles on the basis of this

21

log periodic theory. But nobody, but nobody, in the prior art

22

told you how to put all of these elements together with the

23

predictibility that they’ would work.

24

q

—Gale antenna? Which one was that?

25

A

Yes, sis. That was a one in which instead of

39

41

1

haying straight dipoled——

2

Q

Yes—

3

A

-«—the dipoles were folded dipoles» The woof of

4

the cords--

6

Q

And that was in the prior art, the ——»K-.04

A

Yes, sir, it was. And that was found not to be

antenna?

7

8

anticipatory,

and it was also found that this invention was

9

obvious over the

K„Q, antenna.

10

Q

Was—

it

A

Your Honor-—

12

Q

13

A

Yes, sir»

u

q

K»0.

IB

A

No, sir, it wasn’t. Because, 1511 tell you the

Unohvious-—■

. was disclosed in the application?

16

difference, basically what you had in the case of the K„0.

17

antenna was a folded dipole and you get into the concept of

18

frequency independence, and it was known that dipole antennas,

19

because the folded dipoles were o£e of the first type of anten­

20

nas that were used» I'm sure that you've all seen them.
They were known to be log band antennas. Straight di­

21

22

poles were not. They did not have this band width that you get

23

inherently from a folded dipole, and therefore it was unobvious

24

to go from what is a broad band dipole to a straight dipole wh

25

which had a narrow band width»
40
42

Q

1

All of these antennas are antennas that you put

2

on the rooftop, rather than on your set?

3

q

4

here you could put on your set and it would work, this is for

5

the ultrahigh frequency end of the range» Channels 12-8 and

6

3.
Q

7

a

A

They can work in the house» For example, this one

Then it doesn’t make any real difference whether

it's on top— ■
A

9

No, sir» Not at all. But once you assemble these

10

elements you have the interrelationship between them. You don’t

11

know what’s going to happen. For example, they’re all picking

12

up signals, all the time. So that you have this particular di­

13

pole reviewing a given channel area. You have this one re-

14

cieving another one. And you have them noth relieving the same

15

signal.
So that you get this interdependent reaction that Mr.

16
17

Harris has testified to and is in his testimony, and it’s one

18

of the problems that you have in predicting how this type

19

of antenna is going to work.
So that, you didn’t have anyplace where Mr. Isbell

20
21

could start. Shis is the typ© of case where even the Supreme

22

Courts have recognised that there is this unpredictibility as­

23

pect.
For example in the Great Atlantic and Pacific case,

24
25

340 US at page 152 where the Courts recognised that in the
41
43

,

1

recondite sciences such as chemistry

2

you do have a given problem of predicfcibility or unpredictifoii-

3

ifcy that you don9t have in the purely mechanical arts*

such as the electronics,

4

If the concept of"obvious to try" is going to be the

S

law of the land, I don't think that it augers well for the pa­

6

tent system because I don't know of any invention that is not a

7

combination of old or known elements.

8
9

For example, even the Edison light bulb patent which
was adjudicated in

52 FED 200. I'm sure that you all have heard

'30

the story about Mr. Edison and his trials and tribulations in

11

inventing the light bulb. Under the theory of "obvious to try"

12

without regard to bringing in the concept of predictibility of

13

kind, you would have an invalid patent because all Mr. Edison

14

did was try something like 1400 filaments to try and eventually

15

get to his electric light bulb.
So that what we have here, is Isbell coming up with

16
17

an invention. Something that was absolutely unpredictible as

18

found by the Courts below. The record is replete that in the

19

case of log periodic antennas one could not predict that what

20

the end result was, that it was not a question of cutting and

21

trying because there are thousands and thousands of permutations

22

and combinations that one can cut and try with to- eventually

23

come up with an Isbell type of antenna.
Now if I might go to the Triplett situation. So far

24
25

as, I believe that——-oh, the library concept, Your Honors.

42
44

i
2

Here again, I believe Mr, Justice Harlan was the one
fco ask about the library.

3
4

Here we have concurrent findings below that this was
not a library. There was not shown on the part of anybody--”

5
6

Q

You say concurrent. Do you mean the District

Judges in each of the two circuits or the——
A

7

In the Eighth Circuit, Your Honor, that question

3

•was raised as a defense but it was never decided either by Judge

9

Stevenson or the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. They decided

to

the invalidity of Isbell purely on the question of 103.

n

Q

The question that interested me, accepting those

12

findings, that this is not a library. What effect do you give to

13

the answer of Miss Johnson, that if anybody had inquired about

14

this publication, they could baue had access to it?
\
A

That isn't the test. The test is intention to

17

Q

That's what I want to know. What is the test?

13

A

The test is intention to publish.

19

Q

That is the Mixth Circuit opinion you're relying

IS
16

20

publish.

on, primarily, the language of that?

21

A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

Tompkins, or whatever it is?

23

A

Yes, sir. Mo, that's the Masengill case.

24

Q

What is the test, Mr. Marshall?

25

A

Inthation to publish, Your Honor. Now there was

13
45

1

absolutely no intention to publish here because basically this

2

Quarterly Report number two* which is at issue, is a report

3

which was prepared as a result of the antenna program which

4

was being conducted by the University of Illinois.

5

As Mr. Rawley testified, it was the policy of that

6

department to distribute to the correspondents who were par­

7

ticipating in the program, copies of these reports before they

8

were made availiahe to the public.
So that it was quite clear that sofar as the University

9

10

of lllinios, because they were the ones who had control over

11

this, there was no intention to publish on their part, at least

12

until these copies were distributed to the information addressees.

13

Q

But this had been a library, though?

14

A

She facility—

15

Q

Had been, you would

16

A

Mr. Justice White—

17

Q

18

A

—if—

19

Q

—to publish?

20

A

say that-**™

-- there ®a3 no intent—

If it were a library, I mean if it were a full

21

blown library and a document were put in that library, obviously

22

there was an intention to have this published—

yes—

23

q

24

A

—to anybody who came into the library.

25

Q

But if this were a Xlbary, there would have been

publication?

A

Well—

Q

I me an—

that that document—

Yes—

A

Were in the library, there isn't even any proof

8

If there were a library, and if it were proofed

that it was in the library—

9

q

Yes—

10

A

Because it was a question of three or four days

11

timing here—

12

Q

13

A

I see—™
These quarterly reports were printed up and were

14

sent from the printer to Miss Johnson, who kept them in a bun™

15

die. And she said if somebody would have come in and knew that

16

that specific thing was there, I would have given it to him.

17

Well, Mr. Rawley says that that was not the policy.

18

Q

That was not what' ?

19

A

That was not the policy of the University of

Q

You say that the test is intention to publish,

20

Illinois.

21

22

meaning by that that intention to publish to the whole world?

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

Anybody„

25

A

Anybody„

45

47

i
2

Q

As distinguished from sending it to the Air

Force, pr some special-—

3

A

Well, now there, now I wouldn't draw a line there

4

I woul<3 say that if I sent a publication to the Air Force, un­

5

less there was some confidentiality aspects of that, that could

6

be a publication»

7

But there wasn't any proof that any of these quarterly

8

reports had been mailed out, They were merely there on the floor

9

of Miss Johnsons office. They weren't even in this "Library"

JO

outfit,

n
12

Q

Is there an Index, so that if somebody came to

look through an Index they would find a lead to it?

13

A

Mot at that time, No, sir.

15

Q

But the intent's—

16

A

Oh, I think it would, yes, sir,

17

Q

But the intention to publish, I have a little

14

Eventually it would

have been,

18

confusion about it. Suppose you put it in the largest, most

19

public library in Chicago? And said here, this is for you. The

20

fact that they left it in the package would not interfere with

21

your intention to publish, I would assume—

22

A

Well, I don't know.

23

Q

I donfc think its—

24

A

25

That's pretty close, Mr, Justice Marshall. There

might ba an intention to publish but it wouldnot be accessible
4|T6

48

1

to anybody. You’d have to know it was there. So that if a

2

bundle of pamphlets came in to the Chicago Public Library,

3

and wereput on the floor someplace and there was no Index that,

4

anyone, so that anyone could go in to the back room—
-

5

q

So it wouldn’t be sufficient to just put it in

an envelope and mail it to the—

6

7

A

Mo sir.

8

q

I don't quite see yet, Mr. Marshall how the

9

intention, if that’s the focus, the intention is affected by

10

how the librarian handles it in the first instance. Here you

11

conceed that Miss Johnson intended to Index it at some point,

12

but had not got around to it.

13

A

Yes sir.

14

Q

Why should that relate back to the intent of the

person who /tent it?

15

A

16

Because in this particular instance, Miss Johnson

wore two hats. She- was also like a secretary/office manager of

17
18

this Electrical Engineering Department, and as a result of that,

19

she ran these two offices, plus this library thing that we're

20

talking about.
I would say that, for example, if a publication, a

21

thesis, I mean these are the classic cases, ones where a. thesis

22

is deposited in a library, when does it become a publication.

23

I think what we have to be concerned with is when

24
25

does it become legally known? And—pardon me, sir?

.

47
49

1

Q

If that wasnst a library, what was it?

2

A

It was a room in the Electrical Engineering

3

building in which pamphlets would be placed from time to time *

4

they had, there was no librarian who mas assigned full time there;

5

in fact there was nobody in there full time because most of these

6

publications were kept in steel files„

7

Q

What was the ladyss occupation?

8

A

She was actually a member of the Electrical Engin­

9
10

eering staff and I believe, her training was not as a librarian»
She was like a secretary, or a—

n

Q

Secretary

to who?

12

A

An office

13

Q

Secretary

14

A

To Mr. Lawler. Mr.

manager, ofsomething like

that.

to who?
Lawler was thebusiness man­

IP

ager of the University of Illinois Electrical Engineering De­

16

partment. And the was on his staff. Not as a librarian, but as

17

a secretary, this type of thing.

IS
19

Q

What was Mr. Lawlers testimony, or did he tes­

A

He testified, Justice Harlan, that what he, he

tify?

20
21

testified as to the policy with respect"to the University of

22

Illinois, particularly these quarterly reports which would be

23

distributed to the information addressees„ .And it was his tes­

24

timony that when a report was prepared, it would be sent down

25

to Mass Johnson from the printer for distribution to the infor48
50

mat i on addressees, and that his testimony was that it would

not foe made available to the public , even if they knew it was

3

there, would not be made available to the public until they

4

were mailed out*, until these quarterly reports were mailed out

5’

to the information addressees.

S

Q

And that was on May 5, 1959?

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

And it's' hot clear at all that this document was

That's right, Your Honor,

At that time, is it?

The only testimony, the only documentary evidence

13

of that nature were these mailing slips and things of that na­

Q

15
16

You say that availability is synonoraous with

intention to publish? 1 mean that's the test that you mentioned,

Of the three questions presented in the Petition for

invocation of going against Deere because the Court of Appeals

8

in this case had said that the District Court itself had not

9

followed the formula set down in Graham against Deere with re­

10

spect to holdings of obviousness,

11

JFD is of course primarily interested in number 3,

where JFD is charged with patent infringement„ number 2, where

JFD is charged with unfair competition

And this question started the strictures by the Court

23
24

of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit on the trial judge which had

25

said the District Court did not describe the scope and content
54
56

1

of the prior art, identify the differences between the prior art

2

and claim nor state the level of ordinary skill in the prior

3

art.

4

Something that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals

5

did do. However, we did not get the whole story in the Peti­

6

tion, nor did we get the whole story in the brief filed by the

7

Petitioner in which the Petitioner says, page 63, "The

8

conclusion by the District Court of Claim 5 of the Blonder-

9

Tongue patent is obvious at the time it was made and ife there­

mere

10

fore invalid", is entirely unsupported by any special or sub­

11

sidiary facts.

12

The fact is, however, that, that appearance of that one

13

sentence all by itself in the brief by the Petitioner, is the

14

first sentence of a two sentence paragraph. And the second

15

sentence of that two sentence paragraph by Judge Hoffman on

16

page 89 of the Record says "The alleged improvement was taught

17

by the following references in the prior art. One, technical

18

his — , and three, the prior

They used the word obvious in that one sentence which

20
21

I've read. First, and then he said it was taught by technical

22

report #52. The Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit as £

23

pointed out, said that the trial judge had applied the holdings

24

the formula prescribed in Graham againet Deere, and then it

25

itself tried to follow its own rulinga and it ended up by saying
55
57

i

they8ve said here in the record, if we understand its position

2

correctly, this is the Court of Appeals talking, Blonder-Tongue

3

places chief reliance on the fact that while Isbell.teaches that

4

the two planes in which the dipole elements lay are close en­

5

ough together so that the dipoles are substantially coplanar,

6

Blonder teaches; that the planes may be separated by some dis­

7

tance of less than the wavelength of a band.

8

Then the Court of Appeals went on„ "Asubstantial

$

separation of these planes is clearly shown, however, in the

10

1961 publication cited by the court,(That's the Court below,)

Now, you know Your Honors, section 102 of the Patent

18

Act says that if the invention is described in —printed pub­

lication, it may not be patented.

20

Section 103 says that if it is obvious from one or

21

more prior patents or publications, then on the showing that

22

that was beyond the standing of ordinary skill, it may be

23

patented»

I

that8s where the claim comes from. It is found in this tech­

2

nical report #52 which has been published early enough to be

a reference,

4

there's no question there.

First and second pluralities of dipole elements lying

Right down the line, the spacing, the dipoles in

8

separate planes, it's all there in each of these two things.

9

Except one is a publication antedating the filing date of the

10

patent by more than a year, and the other is the patent itself.

11

However, you'll notice in this chart, on item 4a, in­

12

14

had to say no, but, and we went to two references.

being able to put in the statement that yes, this

15

Let me explain a strain relief, very very briefly ajpd

16

in the simplest terms. When I have to change the electric plug*

17

in the toaster in my kitchen, and knowing that my wife may well

18

pull that plug out by the cord rather than by the plug, I wi

19

tie a knot in the wire entering the hole in the plug before

20

connect those two wires through the screws on that plxig, and new

21

if that plug is pulU,ed by the wire, rather than by the plug,

22

that knot; that has been tied in the wire will bear against the |

23

hole, and we won't be pulling the contacts out.
So this strain relief is something that has existed

24
25

for many years,Blonder, who is one of the co-inventors here,

58

60

|
*

I
2

testified that the strain relief specifically had existed for
many many years.
The Court of Appeals said that Blonder admitted that

3
4

all the other mechanical elements were --- , the only sum total

5

of all the other mechanical elements in this claim 5 is this

6

one item.
Blonder also testified, and by the way Petitioners

7
8

brief makes much of the fact that Blonder is a minister of

9

science type of person, Blonder is of course the moving spirit

10

of the Petitioner, Blonder himself testified, not only as an

11

expert, but also testified that the Ranger 3 antenna put out

12

by Blonder was made in accordance with claim 5 which is the

13

only claim at issue in this patent.
And so, when we look at the Ranger 3 antenna, which

14
15

by coincidence, not exactly coincidence I must confess, happens

16

to be opposite page 40 of this same yellow book. The Ranger 3

17

antenna does not provide a strain relief, or a means of anchoring

18

that lead in, onto the antenna, so on page 2 of the brochure

19

that goes along with the Ranger 3, on the second page, bottom

20

of the first column, there's an imstruction to the installer.
"Wrap electricians tape around the stand off as indie™

21

22

ated by the dotted lines in B„n

23

the antenna as sold. The standoff shown up there at the upper

24

right on page 2B is a means of supporting or spacing the lead

25

in from the vertical mast, and the vertical mast is not the
59
61

So the strain relief isn't on

i

antenna. The antenna sits on the vertical mast and this Ranger

z

3* which according to Mr. Blonder is made in accordance with

3

Claim 5, of his patent, is sold without this strain relief, but

4

sold with the instruction, put some tape around this spot.
So when Judge Hoffman said, in the second sentence of

3
.

6

that paragraph I read to you, when Judge Hoffman said that it

7

is taught. That was the end of it; he’s either right or wrong.

S

And having said it is taught by technical part #52, if it is

3

taught, perhaps he might have said it is , just as 1 looked at

10

a picture of myself, said yes, it’s get a nose, it's got two

II

eyes, yes it has hair, not too much hair, but whein he’ says it’s

12

taught he’s making a statement.

'

.

And when, in a later case, or another

13

(

i

\

i

judge, should

14

want to see what the basis for the decision was, he simply

15

gets a Xerox copy of that reference.
And when the Court of Appeals said it was taught,

16
17

except for some mechanical elements, which Blonder admitted to

18

be old, those mechanical elements added up to all of that si­

19

ngle unit, the strain relief.

20

Now, in a few seconds left, in considering question

21

number two, the charges of fraud, what nasty people JFD were,

22

JFD either led the University of Illinois down the garden path

23

or vice versa, I don’t know.
Just keep in mind that when you read these charges,

24
25

every single one of them is an allegation, and every single one
60

1

of them without a single exception is not supported by proofs

2

And in the time left to me let me just, take up a

3

few of them. Number one, JFD raided the Blonder-Tongue employ­

4

ees. In the period that JFD was supposed to have raided the

5

Blonder-Tongue employees, stolen them all away, a hundred emf‘

6

ployees left Blonder-Tongue, five of those who had left came to

7

JFD. When Mr. Blonder was asked to list all of the antenna manu­

8

facturers, I think he was able to list 6 or 7, maybe there are

9

12 or 15 throughout the country, and why did as many as 5, one
i

10

twentieth of those who left, come to JFD?

11

12

Well,Blonder-Tongue is located in Newark,
JFD
.
- .
’‘ • ‘i
is located in Brooklyn, and I'm sorry to say not too many peo­

13

ple want to kive in Newark, sorry Mr. Justcaie Brennan,;and

14

not too ^any people want to live in Brooklyn, and when somebody

15

is living in Westchester on Long Island, he can commute almost

16

as inconveniently to either piece. In other words there is prox­

17

imity, and JFD got one twentieth of those who left.

'

/

Mr. Balash, Blonder says, was given a job of keeping

18
19

tabs on JFD. Not only keeping tabs on JFD, he was supposed to

20

be really fully in charge, according to the allegations, of the

21

whole antenna division of Blonder.
The general manager of Blonder-Tongue testified that

22
23

Mr. Balash was a very angry man who left, who complained for

24

many years, was reduced gradually in rank and finally left a

25

year and a half before the trial. Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EGBERT H. RXNES, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4

MR» RINESs Thank You, Mr» Chief Justice»

3

While we're on that subject my brother failed to tell

6

you that even the District Court found that when Mr» Balash,

7

the head of our whole antenna program left; all of the records

8

of Blonder-Tongue, dealing with the customer relations and the

3

investigation that Mr» Balash for this very suit; for the plead­

to

ing, mysteriously disappeared,

11

I think also, we should bring out who were these key

12

people that were raided. You cannot compare the fact that in a

13

factory you let so ’many people go when you have production and

14

do many people come back. It's not a numbers game for raiding,

15

they took the head of the antenna business.
-V, •

They took all of our proofs and records with regard

16
17

to the customers» They took our co-inventor of the Blonder pa­

18

tent, who was going to testify about the infringement„ He took

19

all the tests, and this was taken just before the trial, ma/be

20

a month or so before, and in. addition we had one bit of evi­

21

dence on the west coast about the customers, that they took away

22

just before the trial Mr. Sissen, our west coast representative.

23

So we couldn't use him as a witness.

24

So I don't think raiding is a numbers game.

25

Q

-

Well, has Petitioner finally decided to forego

62

any request for reconsidering Triplett, entirely, or in any

i

2

part? I understood you previously to say you would welcome a

mosification of it to some extent,,

Well, Your Honor, I think that is correct» The

5

question which, the latter, the question that was asked of us

6

in our brief by this Court was should Triplett be overruled, Tha-

7

we answered no.

8

Now the question is should there be modification. I

9

think in all of law, when somebody is abusing it, or somebody

10

is not taking advantage of what was intended by something, there

11

are exceptions , and I think the Solicitor is very close to

12

usein the idea that if in fact this were the same trial and they

13

had the opportunity to present their witnesses before, and they

14

didn’t do it, that it seriously ought to be considered whether

f5

there ought to be an estoppel in a situation such as this,

22
23
24
25

this matter of obviousness, just to quote from page 499; "The
experimental results which have been obtained ror the multi—
element log periodic antennas are found to be predictable,"
and a few sentences later, "An investigation of log periodic
63
65

i

structures of thin linear elements (That's Isbell) is planned,"

z

What’s that from? The antenna report of the antenna

at the time that Isbell made his so-called inventione That's

S

the disclosure of the invention, Predictibility in their words

6

1

Not now. And not in the Eighth Circuit.

8

I'd lastly like to plead with this Court, that the

9

Solicitor General has dona a very gracious thing, I think, in

10

presenting a balanced picture on Triplett v. Lowell. I want to

1?

read from the top of page 32 of his brief, and this is what

12

a Solicitor General is for,I think: "It is as important that

13

sound patents and invention be rewarded as that the public be

14

protected against, patent monopolies based on insufficient, in­

15

vention. Both are strong public policies."
