MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Rindskcpf, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ARGUMENT OF ELISABETH R. RINDSKOPF, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

a
9

MRS. RINDSKOPF:
may it please the Court.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
This action arises on a petition for

10

certiorari to the court of appeals of the State of Georgia,

'31

Basically, we are attacking the constitutionality of the Georgia

12

Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, which appears as

13

section 92A-601 through 615 of the Georgia Code Annotated.

14

I will begin with a description of the facts in this

15

case, which I think will serve the dual purpose of making clear

'16

the operation of the act.

17

act violates due process of law by operating to suspend the

18

license plate and vehicle certificate as well as driver's

19

license of certain uninsured motorists involved in certain acci­

20

dents in the State of Georgia.

21

Basically, our contention is that the

The facts in this case are as follows:

Petitioner

22

Bell was driving his own automobile in the small Town of Sparks,

23

Georgia, on November 24, 1968.

24

driving ten miles under the speed limit, he was unable to avoid

25

hitting a bicycle ridden by a five-year-old cyclist who had

Despite the fact that he was

2

1

neglected to yield at a stop sign and entered the path of this

2

on-coming vehicle ,

3

a broken hig and other injuries, and the accident was duly in­

4

vestigated by the Chief of Police of Sparks, Georgia, who

3

noted that the child had failed to yield at the stop sign and

6

found that petitioner was guilty of no traffic violations and

7

consequently gave him no citation.

8
9

The child suffered a broken leg as well as

Subsequent to the accident, the parents of the child
filed an affidavit with the respondent, the Department of

10

Public Safety, alleging that the child had sustained damages in

11

excess of $10,000 and that these damages had been caused by

12

petitioner Bell,

13

Wow, let me digress here to point out. that it was the

14

affidavit filed by the parents that triggered the operation of

15

the act, and once triggered the act operates automatically so

16

that petitioner thereupon was sent a notice of suspension which

17

required him to do one of three things or to face suspension of

18

his driver's license as well as the certificates of registration

19

for his automobile,

20

The three things were Ca) he must demonstrate that he

21

had proof of liability insurance at the time, of the accidenti

22

£b) that he had entered into a settlement agreement whereby he

23

had either already paid the damages claimed or he was doing so

24

on an installment basis; or (c) he had to post bond in the

25

total amount of the damages claimed as well as obtain liability
3

S
1

1

insurance for one year in the future.

2

How these three things are mutually exclusive.

He

3

need not do all but he must do one of the three things to avoid

4

the suspension.

5

Q

Could I interrupt you with one question?

6

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

7

Q

Does the state concede that Mr. Bell was not

8

negligent, was that conceded?

9

A

I think it would be improper — and Mrs.

10

Beasley shakes her head — if I said they conceded it.

11

appear in the description of the facts, the petitioner attempted

12

to question his liability in the administrative proceeding.

13

This was denied him.

14

Cook County, and this appeal is part of the procedure in the

15

act.

16

petitioner was without fault.

17
18
19

As will

He then appealed to the Superior Court of

At that hearing tha judge specifically found that

Q

But is that res adjudicata in any subsequent

nligence suit?
A

No, it is not.

The act is very specific in

20

stating that any findings in the administrative procedure, any­

21

thing coming under the operation of the act, is not to be used

22

in an ancillary damage action.

23

Q

Now, do I understand that this court proceeding,

24

it was a court proceeding and is still part of the administra­

25

tive procedure?

4

I

2
3

5

A

Mo s it is an appeal# a de novo appeal from the

administrative procedure.
Q

But it is not enough of a court proceeding to be

res adjudicata in a negligence suit?
A

That9s correct.

The parents of this child would

6

have had the right to go into court on a separate action — as

7

a matter of fact# they would have had to go into court if they

8

hoped to make the suspension continue.

a

Q

Of course they are not parties to this action?

10

A

That is correct# they are not parties.

If

Q

But to the extent that it was settled between

12

the state and your client# it was a judicial finding# wasn't it#

13

of no negligence?

14

A

Yes# I think that would be —

Well# its significance I think fits into the

overall scheme. . Our argument is that suspension is improper

In other

What I was trying to get at# why the appeal# for

22

finding contrary to the —

Does it have some effect of

23

A

A very good question.

24

Q

What is the answer?

25

A

Wall# I think the answer is that as the state

5

3

1

would have us determine the act, there is no reason to appeal,

2

because there is nothing to discuss at the appeal»

3

Q

that did the Georgia Supreme Court hold?

4

A

‘the Georgia Supreme Court held in fact*- y©s --

S

Q

‘.riiis is what they held?

6

A

Right»

The things that in fact can be considered

7

first at the administrative hearing and then secondly at the

8

court of appeals from the administrative hearing are very much

©

circumscribed.

You can consider whether in fact there was an

1©

accident, whether there 'was insurance, whether the person fell

11

under a few limited exceptions, one of which would be the car

12

was parked at the time of the accident or the car was used

13

without permission.

14

both of the administrative hearing and the court appeal :rom

15

that, are very limited.

16

Q

But you can see 'that the subject matter,

The license is restored if in an accident be­

17

tween the injured party and the driver, and the driver wins

18

under de novo?

19

A

That’s right.

And of course our contention there

20

is naturally it would be possible for the petitioner in this

21

case to bring his own suit for declaratory judgment against the

22

child and her parents, but by the time we reached a decision in

23

that, case the suspension would have run its course anyway.

24
25

Q

Ilay I ask one more question, while we have

interrupted you'.?
6

.o

1

A

Yes.

2

Q

Could Georgia constitutionally provide that no

3

one may drive an automobile without insurance?

4

A

I don't fchinl: there is any question, and certainly

5

we are not questioning that here, and your question then is why,

3

if they can do that can the]? not implement the system that we

7

have here.

8

insurance, such as was upheld by this Court in Ex Parte Pore shy ,

9

then the burden, falls equally on all people.

My answer is that, simply with compulsory Xisibility

One simply doesn2t

to

discuss who is going to b© responsible for an accident, everyone

11

must have insurance.

12

Q

That is not. the case here.

But it dees mean, though, that one — your answer

13

means -that on© doesn't have a constitutional right to remain un­

14

insured?

15

h

Wall, let's rephrase it slightly.

I would say

16

that if one is going to be insured then the burden must equally

17

distributed on all persons, and one does have a constitutional,

18

right not to be discriminated against as to who will have in­

19

surance and who not.

20

Q

21

A

Why did Mr* Bell not have insurance?
Well, now, I hasten, Your Honor, that I didn't

22

represent him in the lower court, but I am told by his attorney

23

that as a methedist minister this is not provided in his salary

24

and he did not obtain the insurance.

25

it.

7

He is not required to have

1

2
3

Q

I am not sure, that I heard you, what, did you say

about a Methodist minister?

A

He is a person of very low salary and the lawyer

4

who represented him at the lower level said he simply did not

5

have or did not allocate funds for insurance.

6

Q

They are not all of low salary.

1

A

I’m sorry?

8

Q

I say they are not all of low salary.

9

A

I suppose not, but I gather there were financial

10

reasons that he did not decide to place money on insurance, and

If

he did not require to do so,

12
13

Q

And Georgia doesn't require everyone who gets in

an accident to have insurance?

14

A

That’s correct.

'IS

Q

If it is ultimately proved that he wasn't at

16
17

fault, h© doesn’t need to —
A

Yes, that’s true.

However, the question is

18

where does h© cefc an opportunity to decide whether or not he was

19

at faults and of course that would not occur in an administra­

20

tive procedure under this act.

21

damage action.

22
23

Q

It would only be in a separate

But Georgia can’t claim that they are using an

accident simply to require insurance?

24

A

That’s right.

25

Q

Because that is what happened.

8

B

I

A

That's correct.

For example, a parson who is in

2 Ian accident and who has the notice of suspension sent to him
3

can avoid getting insurance by settling, and this is frequently

4

what is done because, of course, that is the less expensive

5

route for a person who needs his automobile perhaps for work,

6

what have, you, is simply entering into a settlement agreement,

?

even though he ray not believe himself responsible, because he

3

can't afford the expense of a bond on the one hand and the

9

expense of insurance on the other»

So really what you have is

10

a situation where persons who adjp.it that they are liable are

n

allowed to go without insurance, and one would assume that they

12

would be the ones you would v;ant to insist on having insurance»

13
14

IB
18

Q

And if didn't take the judgment, you don't need

to carry insurance with you?
A

Well, that is a complicated question but I think

the answer is yes, without going into it»

17

Q

You may get your license suspended but --

18

A

Yes,

By the time there was a judgment, probably

19

your license had been suspended and reinstated and then, of

20

course, you would have to pay the judgment or face suspension

21

yet a second time»

22

Q

Would you raise your voice a little?

23

A

I’m sorry, yes»

24

Q

You anticipate that if you prevail here that

25

Georgici will change its law to require insurance as a condition
9

1
2

precedent?

A

No, I don't.

I think that the state — and let

3

me add that the state keeps no legislative history but 1 have

4

done some looking into some of the journal, and it seems that

5

they are very anxious not to employ a system of compulsory

6

liability Insurance»

7

probably would do would be to allow a hearing on the question of

8

possible or probable liability, as is done in approximately

9

four other states in the country at this time.

I think what they could do and what they

And this would

10

be — this liability could be considered both at the administra­

II

tive hearing as well as at the subsequent court hearing»

12

think that, is probably what they would do.

13

speak with any authority on that.

14

Q

15

K

Yes, it would.

16

Q

If they would do what?

n

A

I

Of course, 1. can't

Well, that would satisfy you, I suppose?

If they would simply allow at the administrative

18

procedure a consideration of whether or not the person was

19

liable for the damages, whether there was a possibility that

20

he could at a later date be responsible for those damages.

21

I would add that it seems to me it would be highly proper at

22

such a hearing for them to consider, as they do not do now, the

23

accident report, which is submitted after every accident by the

24

police officer who investigates the accident.

25

now, there is absolutely no investigation made.

10

And

As things stand
The state

XU

1

simply proceeds to suspend licenses on the say-so of another

2

person who has been damaged,

3

Q

What defense could he make for not giving bond?

4

A

I don't

3

Q

Getting insurance?

6

A

I don't think that he needs to make a defensa

In

7

because the state does not require him to have insurance.

8

other words, ho is given a license without being told that he

9

must have it.

10

Q

There is no such requirement in Georgia,
Suppose the complaint is made of an accident

11

turns out to bo a fraudulent on® ©r a mistake one, does he have

12

any opportunity to contest that?

13

A

In this provision in the fact, the state statute,

14

there is a penalty for perjury but, frankly, I am not able to

IS

answer your question because I do not know of a case where

IS

perjury has been made use of.

n

"which is submitted simply is the opinion of the person and I

18

gather that everyone is entitled to his opinion as to whether

19

or not he is responsible, and this might not be grounds for

20

perjury, even though in a subsequent damage action he was found

21

to be responsible for the accident.

22
23

Q

In other words, the affidavit

But you did he could be cited if he wasn't

driving the car?

24

A

I'm sorry, Mr, Justice,

25

G

You say he couldn't defend at this hearing that
11

J.J.
7

i

the car wasn’t being used by him and it was used without his

2

knowledge or something?

3

A

Your Honor, that is a vary limited exception

4

and it brings up a good point»

5

was being used without his permission.

The exception is that the car

S

Q

Right.

7

A

In Georgia there are three exceptions to the

8

rule -that fchar2 is no vicarious liability for an, owner who lends

9

his automobile, so that in many situations you have an owner

10

who lends his automobile who could not be held responsible in

If

an action at law and yet who under this act could have his

12

driver’s license as well as the documents needed to operate

13

his vehicle suspended.

14

I think that the argument we are making here is

13

probably clear.

We ars arguing basic due process contentions

16

that it is improper to suspend a license that involves such

17

important rights as the property, in this case of the auto­

18

mobile cis well as liberty and interstate travel, without

19

affording some sort of prior due process hearing.

20

add that naturally a balance has to be struck between the in­

21

dividual rights that we are asserting and the state rights

22

that the state is asserting.

We would

23

On that point we would add that we don’t think that

24

the state has demonstrated how the act as described her© pro­

25

motes public safety.

-

Even if the act, which we do not concede,

12

1

did promote public safety, we fail to see why it is impossible

2

t© implement some sort of a due process hearing before 'sus­

3

pension occurso

4

why this would be such a hardship on it.

The state has nowhere in its brief explained

5

Q

They give you a hearing before suspension —

3

A

Yes.

7

Q

— but you say here the hearing mmt include —

8

A

We are saying that the hearing —

9

Q

— a fault detenaination?

10

A

That's right.

1?
12

V

now construed is a nullity.
Q

We are saying that the hearing as
It really accomplishes no end.

Wouldn't you think the state should have a rule

13

that at any time, from the moment anybody is in an accident

14

you have to have; insurance?

15
16
17
18
19

A

1 think that would be possible, but that is

again not what we have here.
Q

1 know, but in that event all you would have is

the same kind of a hearing that you have got.
A

Well, I wouldn't agree with your point until we

20

waive the bond provisions.

21

about here is the fact that -this individual will b@ required to

22

post over $1,Q0C in bond as well as obtain insurance in order

23

to retain the use of his license.

24
25

Q

In other words, what I am concerned

Do you make an equal protection argument inde­

pendently of your due process argument?

13

1

A

Ho, there has been no equal protection argument
l

2

raised in this case,

3

but we have not dons so.

4
5

I think it would be possible to raise one

Q

What would be the basis for the equal protection

A

X think that our equal protection argument would

i
i

argument?

6

7

be simply that it is improper to require more of on® person

8

than another without, showing some reasonable basis for doing so*

9

and here this individual* who has not been shown financially

10

responsible nor negligent* is being required to post a fairly

11

substantial bond, over $1,000* as well as obtain insurance for

12

one year, while other individuals who may or may not be wreck­

13

less and financially responsible are not being required to do

14

that*

15

How, we don't raise this point here.

16

Q

Suppose he was indigent?

17

A

Suppose who was injured, the petitioner here?

18

Q

Suppose he was indigent?

19

A

Oh, I'm sorry.

20

Q

i

;

i
j

i
i

21

22

What would you say about equal protection argu-

|

raanfc under our recent opinions?

A

1 think again I would say that equal protection

23

does not allow access to a court to be conditioned on posting

24

so large a bond, but I think partially what we are dealing with

25

here, if h© feels he is not responsible for the accident and

14

I

1

wants to have his case tried in court, where he will either he

2

found negligent or not negligent, he has to put up a substantial

3

amount of money in order to enter and defend against such a

4

court action.
And let me point out again that the driver who decides

5

S

that it is either too much money to post the bond or feels per­

7

haps he is responsible and enters into a settlement agreement,

8

is through with the act at that point.

9

insurance.

He never has to obtain

Yet our person who contends -that he is not respon­

10

sible for the damages in this accident, and I think any inves­

11

tigation of even the most basic documents on how it showed,

12

it showed that he was not responsible, is being required both

13

to get insurances as well as to post a large bond.

14

Q

Would it be proper for Georgia to pass a law

15

that a person who has five accidente without insurance should

16

talc© out insurance?
A

I don't think there is any question on that, be­

19

Q

How about one accident?

20

A

One accident wouldn't concern me, if the person

17
18

cause. —■

21

could b© shown — as long as there is a basis to require this

22

person to get insurance.

23

everyone to have insurance —

24
25

Q

Of course, if you want to require

*?he point is that you were involved in one acci­

dent and from now on you are required to get insurance, but
15

JLH

1

only because you had an accident.

2

A

I would be slightly concerned with that.

3

Q

Then you must be concerned about any states who

4

have a rule that you have one accident you get points, whether

5

you were at fault or not.

6

A

Of course, that is not at issue here.

7

Q

X realise that.

8

A

1 think that if you ware found responsible for

9

the accident —

10

Q

Well, you can get points toward losing — if you

11

have enough of them you can lose your license, whether you are

12

at fault ox not.
A

13

Well, as long as that is required of everyone,

14

I think — let me amend my answer -- 1 would say that it would

15

be all right.

16

drivers can be involved in an accident and only on© of them is;

17

required to obtain insurance.

18

settles is not required to obtain insurance.

19

to the hypothetical you are posing, Mr. Justice Marshall, as

20

long as every driver —

21

Of course, in Georgia, you understand, two

In other words, a person who
1 wouldn't object

Q

You aren't talking about equal protection now,

23

A

I beg your pardon?

24

Q

You said on® can pay and one can't.

22

25

are you?

equal protection, isn't it?
IS

That is

JL.V

A

I

Ho, 1 aaj saying one is required to pay and one is

2

not required to pay.

3

not required then to also have insurance.

4

because he felt he was responsible in the accident,

5

to your hypothetical, I am saying that as long as every driver

6

after involved in an accident is required to have insurance, S

7

would not object to -that.

In other words,, the driver who settles is

8

Q

9

A

That is not this case, no.

10

Q

Why not?

11

A

He may have settled
In answer

But that is not this case?

Well, in this case, given an accident with a two-

12

party involvement, one parson may be required to get insurance

13

simply because he feels he wants to take the ease to court.

14

wants court adjudication as to whether or not he was respon­

15

sible.

16

Another person may be totally responsible for the accident and

17

because he agrees to settle before suspension, in other words

18

provision, and it read that anyone who is obviously free from

Mew,

Suppose they claim $100,000, he has to put up &

bond of at least $100,000?
A

7

That isn't quite so in practice, Mr. Jus-tic®,

8

because the director does have a discretion to increase the

9

amount or decrease the amount, and although the statute says

10

that it is not to be below the amount that is claimed, he does

11

in fact do so if hs believes it is too much, and he did so in

52

this case.

13

14

is a concrete example of the practical aspects ©f it, where it

15

ia limited to an amount that in the judgment of the director

16

would be sufficient to cover the. possible judgment that might

17

be obtained.

The amount claimed was $10,000.

The bond that was

18

Q

There is no ceiling on the amount?

19

A

Yes, there is.

So this

It is $10,000 — the security is

20

$10,000 for a serious injury or death, or $20,000 for cue

21

accident and $5,000 for property damage, which is the same

22

amount of minimum insurance that is required.

23

Q

If the claim by the injured party was for

24

$50,000, the director might be satisfied that that wasn't an

25

illusory' claim, fee still would be limited to the figures you
22

11

have given?

2

A

That’s righto

3

Q

The complaint here though, or?, the due process

4

ground * is that while this determination is being made as to

S

amounts, no determination whatever, even a preliminary deter­

6

mination, is made on liability, so it throws into one kettle

7

all the people, all the drivers, whether they are at fault or

8

slot.

9

A

That is —

10

Q

How do you meet that due process?

11

A

The state feels, Mr. Chief Justice, that since

12

the court, we believe, institutos a system ©f compulsory in­

13

surance, we ax© merely delaying the requirement until the

14

occurrence of particular incidents which is related to the

15

liability, and that is involvement in an accident in which a

16

claim is made, and so we are simply delaying the requirement

17

and the person at the outset of getting his license and of

18

licensing his car knows that,

19

manual, what the requirements of the safety responsibility law

20

are.

21

it is contained in the driver’s

S© if he chooses to bear the risk of having to put

22

up security at a later time, then it is his own choice; he can

23

avoid that by getting insurance at the beginning, and that is

24

what the state is trying t© get people to do, is trying to en­

25

courage them to get insurance at the beginning.
23

But they say

1

we won’t require it because we know there are scree people that,

2

aren't of great, mans and would rather not pay insurance pre­

3

miums over the years and take the risk of being involved in an

4

accident and having to post security.

So that in the event

i
5

there is a judgment against him there will be money there to

6

cover that judgment, otherwise perhaps he will be judgment

Q

Mrs. Beasley, am I correct that if you had an

accident between two cars and somebody was injured, and the

10

police file charges against on© driver and he is convicted of

11

wreckless driving and has insurance and the other driver :1s

12

found not guilty of anything but doesn't have insurance, he

13

would lose his driver’s license?

14

A

15

Justice, he is given the choice of putting up» security of the

16

amount that is claimed by the other driver.

18

faith with an affidavit that he believes he has reasonable

Q

By the way, is this part of tine license act —

4

A

No, it has never been suspended because the

5

stays have been granted and so on and, as a matter of fact,

6

that points up a very good thing about this particular case.

7

When Mr. Bell was brought under the provisions of the Safety

8

Responsibility law, the provision says that it would be a three-

9

year suspension.

That has since been changed by the Legislature

10

to a one-year suspension.

There were two cases that were taken

11

to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the ons-year

12

suspension was retroactive so that in cases like Mr. Bell's, a

13

person who was going along with a three-year suspension could

14

all of a sudden get his license bask.

It is two-fold, Mr. Justice, and the first thing

is that the state believes that that question is a legal ques­

You can suspend his license for a while.

15

made within ten days of the accident.

Suppose there are a lot ©f people in Georgia,

either cottoa farmers or day laborers, who couldn't put up a

bead of $1,000 or so, what would you do about them?
A

4

Well, ©f course, if they can't put up a bond,

5

then they are probably going to lose their license for a period

of on© year»

Take their license away from, them?

8

A

We would have to do that if they were unable to

put up th® bond.
Q

Suppose their nesst-door neighbor had a big farm

and he didn't have to limit himself to $1,900, what would you

12

do about that neighbor?

Would you let him make a bond?

13

A

Yes, as a matter of fact

14

Q

Even though the other man cannot?

15

A

Th® situation is this, if the nan who has th®

16

accident is a poor man, for example, and he has a neighbor who

17

has property aid he could gat him perhaps to put up the proper

18

bond for him — he doesn't have to put up cash, he can put up —

19
20

Q

I know, but putting up a bond for some people,

$1,©0O ©r $2,000 or $5,000 is just impossible, of course.

That's right.

we are interested also in protesting the poor person who is

If we could have compulsory insurance where everybody

had to have it, that would be fine.

12

Q

The state could have put that on, eouldn'fc it?

13

A

That's right, and what we are saying is we ar©

14

favoring those who are poorer and who may not have the money to

15

buy insurance by delaying it, delaying the requirement for

16

showing financial responsibility until you are involved in an

17

accident»

equal protection problem except that it is perhaps discrimina­

19

tory against those who buy insurance, because there is

20

responsibility at the beginning.

So we don't think that that favoritism brings up an

That a divorce case should be on a higher level?

Yes .

No, not necessarily.

A

Yes, it is, it certainly would be to those per­

I think it depends on who you are

looking at as far as that is concerned, but there is really no

right, constitutional right involved in driving on the highway.

There is a constitutional right not to be denied

14

A

That's right, there certainly is, but we don't

1

fact, two cases mentioned where some of the proceedings ware

2

regarded to be warranted because of what the court called

3

extraordinary situations»

4

and that was a situation in which the bank stockholders were

§

assessed after a bank had baas closed for the purpose of paying

6

off depositors., and the assessment that was made and execution

7

was allowed thereon before there was a determination in court,

&

there was allowed to be execution, and die process was raised

9

in that situation ©ad the court felt that that was an extra­

SO

ordinary situation and that the state had a right to protect

ii

depositors this way and that it was not a denial of equal

12

protection or of due process t© require 'the stockholder - to put

13

up that money without a question of there being first of all a

14

court hearing.

15

On© of those was Cortham Brothers

And 3' think it was very important to this case that

16

in Cortham Brothers, of course, which is cited in Sniadach,

17

the court found that when they became stockholders they agreed

to do this and it is the same thing when you become a driver

and take on a license, you agree to put up 'the security if you

that involved a foreign attachment where in order for you to

contest or to defend against foreign attachment, you had to put

up security before a determination, which is the same thing

4

we have here, and the court found that that was not a violation

5

of due process *

Eowas far as the garnishment situation, the court

S
7

said in the due process cases w@ have got to look at two

8

things, the nature of the property and the problems of procedure

9

of due process that are involved.

10

In Sniadach, the nature of the property was the man's

11

wages and the court regarded that as a fundamental right that

12

he had to his wages without the state stepping in to help a

13

creditor first,

14

arc talking about, posing of security, and the only right that

15

he is deprived of there is the right to the interest on that

16

security for two ycjars.

the requirements for driver * s licenses, one of the conditions is

to get insurance or be willing to put up security, and that is
