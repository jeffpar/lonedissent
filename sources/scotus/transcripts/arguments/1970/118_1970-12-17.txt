ARGUMENT OF HAROLD B. WAHL, ESQ.,

6

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WAHL:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court.

3

This is a right interesting libel case.

The trial judge

9

actually directed a verdict for the plaintiff on compensatory

10

damages and

11

dollars they were going to give the plaintiff on compensatory

12

damages.

13

told the jury that the only question was how many

As to punitive damages, he told the jury that they

14

could only-give those if malice were proved, and the jury

IS

brought in no punitive damages.

16

was successful in urging upon the court, and the Florida courts

17

have consistently held in this case, that the Hew York Times

18

doctrine -- and I quote from the opinion of the District Court

19

of Appeals, on review -- only applies

20

a public official."

21

The attorney for the plaintiff

22

24

or a weekly newspaper, or a semi-weekly newspaper of its own.

23

The locale was

with a population of 1,523., and a candidate to succeed himself.

He was also practically a full-time candidate for county tax

assessor, politicising for that job while his brother, James

Damron, ran his garage.

He was mayor of the municipality of Crystal River,

In the middle of the election campaign for county tax

7

assessor — and, of course, he was continuously running for

8

reelection as mayor and was subsequently defeated -- the

9

defendant, the Ocala Star-Banner, the daily newspaper in nearby

10

11

Marion County, ran the offending article.
In their article it was stated erroneously that

12

Leonard Damron, rather than his brother, had had a case contin­

13

ued which was an indictment for perjury in the federal court in

14

a civil rights case.

IS

17

civil rights case.

Now, if there was anything that was of

18

Nov;, the article was written by a man named Meir who

19

had just recently coroe to this position with the Ocala paper.

20

He had never even met the plaintiff, but he had written a

21

number of articles about the political goings on in Crystal

22

River where there were two factions and the plaintiff was the

23

head of one of them.

24

the reporter phoned in '-tbs correct name of James Damron, but

election, and he concluded by claiming damages to his ’-eputa-

14

15

didn’t even allege malice in his complaint.

doesn't appear in it, even though the court did submit the

17

issue of malice on punitive damages.

Q

He

The word "malice”

What is the significance of your position there?

In Florida, in pleading, must they allege —
A

Malice in a libel suit, yes, sir.

And certainly

21

under Wexv York Times you have to allege malice.

22

moved to dismiss the complaint because of failure to allege

23

malice and move to strike the public figure damages, where he

24

was claiming damages to him as mayor and as candidate for

25

public office.

Both motions were denied.

The newspaper

The case came on for

3

trial and the court, as I say, actually instructed the iury to

1

bring in a verdict on compensatory damages, the only question

3

being the amount of dollars.
Plaintiff testified that he had been defeated for

further testified that he was defeated for reelection as mayor.

Mr. Wahl, the salary of the office to which

this gentleman was an aspirant was $9,000 a year?
A

21

Uy understanding, and it is pure hearsay, is

22

that the jury verdict was a two-year salary, $18,000, and the

23

esitra was a little bonus.

Well,

he didn't get paid for that.

3

Q

That was a non-paying job?

4

A

That was a non-paying job.

But the whole thrust

5

of the case, Mr. Justice Stewart, was that this article was

published right in the middle of the election campaign, when it

was too late for him to do anything about it.

Q

Would you think; a jury could reasonably find that

he lost the election because of the article?

13

A

well --

14

Q

Could decide all those factors?

15

A

Yes, because there isn't any question that we

16

made a mistake.

M

Q

Could they reasonably find it?

98

A

Yes,

sir.

That was his whole theory, and if

19

you erroneously accuse a man of being indicted for perjury in a

20

civil rights case in rural Florida in 1966,

21

as being elected to public office is concerned.

Q

he's a goner as far
There is no

Was there any evidence of injury to him in addi­

tion to or except for this loss of office?
A

Oh,

he intermingled the two.

6

He said that he

had lost business in this shop that his brother., the one who

2

-was indicted, was running for him.

said he felt bad and it made hint feel bad, his neighbors and

of this kind where the plaintiff made Ms own bed.

10

should not be sent back for another trial and have more expense

but that this Court should direct a verdict for the newspaper.

21

How, he had ample opportunity in this case to prove his malice

22

because he was seeking $500,000 in punitive damages in his com­

23

plaint, and he brought in everything he could on malice to

sustain his punitive damages.

So he has had a chance to prove

The only thing that he showed on malice was three

his seeking the public eye, this new newspaper editor who had

20

had this job about a month had heard of him, and he just auto­

matically assumed, when he read the name Damron over the phone,

22

that they were talking about a public figure and so he put the

23

public figure's name in the article and wrote the article

about the public figure rather than about his brother.

This new man just simply made an er*-or.

9

Q

At what stage of the campaign was it published?

10

A

Right in the middle of it.

11

Q

What?

12

A

Right in the middle., two or three weeks before

13

the election.

14

Q

Two or three weeks?

13

A

As I understand, right square in the middle of

16

it.

And I can agree with you that the roan who wrote the

17

story was in error, he wa3 careless, he was negligent, but he

18

certainly wasn't guilty of express malice or a calculated lie

19

with attempt to harm.

What did they do about it, if anything?

21

A

The next day the newspaper ran a retraction and

He -just plain made a mistake.

The next day or a few days later, the plaintiff wrote a letter-

in to the paper and again said,

But what I say is that the New York Times doctrine

You mean he is bound by New York Times?

That's right.

He has put himself in the Mew York Timas case?

A

He has gotten in bed with the New York Times

17

doctrine,, yes, sir.

18

You are not suggesting he waived any of his

rights by doing that?

20

No, noc certainly not.

But 1 say that he has

doctrine.

Nothing was submitted to the jury about whether

And you are arguing here that it is applicable

but that it was satisfied?
A

I am saying three things. Your Honor;

First,

the defendants admitted their liability before we ever tried

10

this case at a time when the decisions of this Court were well

11

knoi^n and well available to them to make any objections as to

12

this rule at the time of trial.

13

Q

They admitted their liability?

14

A

Yes, sir.

IS

0

But only for compensatory damages?

10

A

Yes, sir.

The jury then -- and, as I pointed

17

out earlier also. Chief Justice Burger, we have the Florida

18

statute that prohibits the award of punitive damages unless if

19

the publication has been retracted and the jury made this de­

20

termination that it was properly retracted.

2!

Q

Is the only evidence of admittinq liability and

22

not relying on New York Times that material that you pointed

23

out to us in the appendix?

24

A

That is the only matter of record, yes,

should have been -- that the newspaper should have been pre­

19

cluded from raising this issue which they hadn't raised at the

20

trial, but the Florida courts, under the Florida procedure,

21

doesn’t seem to -- don't seem fca have taken that course.

22

District Court of Appeal has taken the issue and decided it.

23

A

The

That is the point I was trying to explain,

sir.

24

At the time this case went to the District Court, the onlv

25

point that was urged on the District Court was New York Times
23

i

vs„ Sullivan.

2

Q

Well, I know, but --

3

A

And the argument at that point was that the

4

libel complained of was a perjury charge unconnected with any

S

office sought or held, and it was not within the purview of

6

official conduct.

7

Q

But if the New York Times issue was out of the

8

case because they admitted their liability, why would the

0

Florida court even deal with the issue?

10
11

12

They would say you

have waived the question, you have admitted it.
A

Mr. Justice White, I'm sorry, I cannot read into

they must return a verdict for the plaintiff because of the

25

Q

So doesn^t that imply that there was no

The format of the discussion of the court at

5

have got to return a verdict even if it is only for one

It seems to me that if the Florida court

read the record, and certainly it should be authoritative on

22

how to read that record for purposes of Florida law, if the

23

Florida court had read the record as indicating that the news­

24

paper had admitted liability in the sense that Hew York Times

23

applies but we have published maliciously, why would the
31

Florida court ever have affirmed on the basis -- not: on that

basis but on the basis of the New York Times rule, has no rele~

3

vance to this case?

I can’t answer the question.

On that same subject, Mr. Dunn, did you oppose

on the appeal to the Florida court of appeals --

7

Yes, sir, I did.

have an appeal because they conceded liability?

IO

A

No, sir, it was not.

'ti

Q

You did not make that argument?

12

A

No, sir, 1 did not.

13

Q

Because the Florida court of appeals starts

14

right out and says it is contended here that the New York Times

That’s correct.

any.

the trial court was wrong in saying that malice need not be

That’s correct.

And the Florida court of appeals says that New

That is all there is to it,

I think --

Q

I think
isn't it?

There is a directed verdict in effect as far as

22

liability for publishing the article is concerned.

The only

23

issue that went to the jury was the quantum of damages.

24

A

That is correct.

And your issue up here is simply whether or not

damages are to be measured under the New York Times rule or

under state law*

your side claimed the benefit in New York Times, the other

side had come back and said, "We’re awfully sorry, this issue

structions, no request for an instruction on New York Times,

although this was tried after New York Times, and the appellant

isn’t entitled to have the case reversed on the basis of New

A

17

Now, what is the Florida law?
I think the Florida court of appeals at this

18

point, had this point been raised in the district court of

19

appeals, the district court of appeals would have looked at

20

the record and if it had found that trial counsel Ayers did

21

what my friend here accuses him of, they would have said that

22

ends it»

23

Q

Well, I know, but the newspaper didn't request

24

any instructions under New York Times,, and didn’t object to the

25

instructions based on New York Times.

Correct, but -

Were it not for the holdings of this Court as

exemplified by Beckley, it doesn't make any difference how bad

a mess trial counsel makes of a case, Beckley vs. Hanks, this

Court will go into it itself and even though trial counsel has

stood there and not objected to instructions —

9

Q

What was the case you mentioned?

10

A

Beckley vs. Hanks, which is cited in our brief.

11

You held in that case that even though the newspaper council

12

actually requested the wrong instructions, you would examine

and if you found the Constitution of the United States, as

14

exemplified in Hew York Times and succeeding cases, had been

15

violated, you gentlemen yourselves -~

Q

16

Well, 2 don’t know if the Florida appellate

17

court said this issue is not an issue on appeal because it was

18

not raised in the trial court, I am not so sure we would -A

W

Well, of course, I don’t know about that, but

20

21

a new trial and cited all of these constitutional cases, there

22

was no question, he didn't say —
Q

23

Let me as you this;

Let's assume that we re-

24

versed and the case went back to the Florida district court of

25

appeals.

Would the issue still be open as to whether the Hew
37

1

York Times question had been waived in the trial court?
A

2

2 don't think so, because that issue wasn't

3

raised there in the first place, and I don't think you can go

back»

court would agree with me, that you can't come up here and then

go back and say, well, now, I forgot to raise something here

and now 1 want to raise it*

2 -would certainly argue strenuously, and I am sure the

I don't think so*

1 know, but you forgot to raise something in

the trial court and you raised it in the appellate court.
A

10

It was raised in the trial court and when I

11

came into the case, the first thing I did was to file a motion

12

and under Florida procedure at that time you can raise these

13

points and file the motion and not only have a motion but

14

cited the cases by name.

13

Q

That puts the issue in the case, you think?

16

A

Yes, sir, 1 certainly do.

And there was no

17

intimation under the Florida appellate courts that that wasn't

20

upon the one issue where they erroneously said that official

conduct of a public official was not involved therefore New

23

And the district court of appeals assumed that the

about Beckley, because you held in Beckley vs. Hanks, in that

case the newspaper lawyers themselves had requested the wrong

instructions,

and you said that these constitutional issues

were of such importance that even though they hadn’t raised

he says that the people didn't treat him

22

as nicely as they used to,

they kind of looked down at him

23

when he passed by, and he wasn't feeling so good any more,

24

he lost some campaign contributions, and people said a man

like that shouldn't run for office, that's all, and the fact

39

and

t

that he claimed that he lost some business in his garage that

2

was run by the fellow who wasn't up.

3

But New York Tiroes -- my own surmise of what happened

4

is that ferial counsel was Knocked down so hard when he filed

3

his motion to strike the New YorK Times damages as a public

6

figure and move to dismiss for want of raallee* he was thrown

7

down so hard then that he didn't want to antagonize the judge

3

and prejudice himself with the jury by raising some more stuff

3

before the jury or at the trial in which he was going to get

Knocked down again.

11

my friend Ayers didn't say more.

12

But this record does not support a concession of
liability.

That is just my own speculation as to why

Is all the record here or is it limited, what is

here, to what is in print?

Do we have all the record?

You have the whole record.

Y'ou have the whole

record.

20

Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, the trial counsel was so con­

21

cerned with the punitive damages and the fact that there was

22

no question that tve did run the article, that we did run the

23

mistake, that there had to be a concession that we had run the

24

article and that we had made a mistake.

25

he certainly did not concede

You have everything, of course, as is customary.

What you are arguing to us is that having passed

10

on it, you*re entitled to a reversal on the theory that there

were no damages available at all except under the strictures

and limitations of the New York Times rule.

13

A

Absolutely correct,

14

Q

Is that right?

13

A

Right.

And I am very much disturbed that this

opinion, being in the printed Southern Reporter, which says

17

that New York Times only applies to official conduct of a

18

public official, leaving out candidates, matters of public in­

that anyway there was nothing referred to in the so-called
