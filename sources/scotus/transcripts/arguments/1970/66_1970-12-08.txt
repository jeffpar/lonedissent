ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G. SEGAL, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

9

MR. SEGAL: May it please

the Court, first, as

I am

10

sure tile

11

agree at all with my friend, Mr. Clark, that the question here

12

is whether the New York Times -- and I assume he \>/ould include,

13

though he did not say, Butts and Walker and the rest of the

14

line -- are to be extended, and I quote him, "to 200 million

15

plain people engaging in ordinary life."

30

question on which the petition for certiorari was granted.

17

is not the question in the petitioner’s brief, and it is not

18

the question before this Court.

19

Court would know, I would like to say that 1 do

not

That is not the
It

Further, T say with full deference that I do not agree

20

with the steps or the facts presented by Mr. Clark.

21

that some critical facts are inexactly stated and other critical

22

facts are omitted.

I must say

Therefore I feel called upon, as I had not originally

23
24

intended, to go into the facts for the Court, particularly

25

since in the cases I have referred to this Court has adopted the

2
i

'i

salutary policy of reviewing de novo the cases to find whether

3

Court has been met in the opinion below, whether jury or court»

4

In the first place, Hr. Clark creates an erroneous

5

impression when he says that there was a series of 21 broad­

6

casts --a series of 21 broadcasts on WIP about Mr» Rosenbloom.

There was no series at all.

We are not dealing here with a

We are not dealing with a documentary.

We are

11

We are dealing with statements which occupied mere

12

seconds, the four sentences at the maximum in newscasts by a

13

highly oriented station, which every half hour of the day, 24-

14

hours a day, 48 times a day, 320 times a week, every week of

13

the year, every day of the year, broadcasts every half hour of

or a four-sentence statement, and there is no longer one there.

And every statement before Your Honor is that cate­

It is a one-sentence statement, a two-sentence statement,

19

Nov/ the second thing my friend Mr. Clark did is he

20

began with a statement of facts which said that on October 1st

2!

there were arrests, twenty of them he said, and Hr. Rosenbloom

22

was one.

23

tors, and they were the distributors who supplies these opera­

£4

tors and news dealers, Mr. Rosenbloom.

25

Well, they were news dealers, they were store opera­

And then he says the next event was on October 4 when
3

1

W1P had a broadcast to which lie objects.

2

great, great deal happened between October 1 and October 4 to

3

which Mr. Clark did not advert.

4

Well, Your Honors, a

What happens here is that as a result of complaints

5

from the public, and after a two-month investigation, Mr. Howard

6

Leary -- not Captain Ferguson -- Mr. Howard Leary, I think,

7

acknowledge at that time as perhaps America's leading police
commissioner, later Commissioner of New York, ordered the arrest

9
10

n

by Captain Ferguson, and he ordered a crackdown on what he then
regarded as obscene material.
I might, say to Your Honors that Mr. Clark has made a

12

good deal of Captain Ferguson's definition and has ridiculed

13

it and has said that this would make the finest paintings in

14

the museum obscene.

15

few years ago, a few years before that -- we are now talking

'16

about 1963 --a chief justice of the United States District

17

Court for the State of Washington stated that predice defini­

13

tion of what he thought a majority of the people in the State of

19

Washington considered obscene.

2

States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, consisting of

2!

three judges, every one of *tfhom served as chief judge of the

22

Ninth Circuit, affirmed on the opinion below, stating that the

23

judge had found a fact.

24

But I suggest to Your Honors that just a

2

the city newspapers had headlines about it, and necessarily head­

3

lines about Mr. Rosenbloom, who was the supplier.

4

station CBS-TV had headlines about it, and that happened on the

5

1st» and it happened on the 2nd.

6

are events to which Mr. Clark did not advert.

And the

It happened on the 3rd.

There

7

And those newspaper articles and that CBS-TV telecast

8

said that Mr. Rosenbloom’s products \tfere smut and were obscene.

9

And what did Mr. Rosenbloom do about that?

I mention» just in

10

passing, he brought a law suit about two weeks later, and he

n

didn’t name WIP in that law suit.

12

know there tvas a broadcast on WIP until October 27, weeks later.

13

He didn't even know there was a broadcast.

I am going to show he didn’t

But he brought a suit against all of the newspapers,

14
15

against the police commissioner, against the District Attorney,

16

one for a million dollars in damages, and against CBS-TV -- not

17

WIP -- one for a million dollars in damages and a second to

18

enjoin the police commissioner and District Attorney from

19

prosecuting him for criminal violation of the obscenity law,

20

and against the newspapers for calling his products smut and

21

obscene and calling him a smut peddler and a peddler of obscene

22

mater iai.

23

He did not name WIP and be averred there that so

24

great was his damage by virtue of those broadcasts by those

25

people that all -- nearly all of his customers is the language

5

1

he used -- nearly all of his customers returned all of his

2

material to him, which he had supplied to them, and

Your Honor, but 1 would say it had to be defamation, because I

10

don't know what else it could be.

It is not a complaint

11

grounded elegantly for libel, but I think it is.

12

Q

What was the outcome of it?

13

A

The outcome, Your Honor, is that shortly after

14

November 1, when we broadcast an innocuous statement that the

15

judge would decide in ten or eleven days --he did decide, he

16

dismissed as to all of the newspapers, he dismissed as to

n

CBS-TY, and a little later he dismissed as to the two city

officials.

Rosenbloom was rearrested, and that was the day of the first

broadcast of which my friends complained about WIP.
Now, I would like to get one thing straightened out.

17
18

Hy friend says that there was a headline to that broadcast

19

which read ’’City Cracks Down on Smut Business.”

20

Your Honors that he is in error.

I submit to

In the first place, the station doesn’t have head­

21

22

lines.

And I have asked my friend, one of the counsel who had

23

all of the original records, because the clerk had sent them to

24

him for reasons neither he nor I can understand -- I have asked

25

him to give one of our boys who brought down to me yesterday
7

1

all of the original records, and I am going to submit them to

2

the Court.

3

They will show Your Honors that most of them don’t
have anything about headlines.

And even this one, on the front

cover, apparently for the advice of the announcer, is called
’’Repeating the headline news."

It was testified to by nobody

7

as having been broadcast.

The manager said five years later,

8

3ie wouldn’t say it was or wasn’t.

9

the same day of the broadcast to which I am going to refer, the

But he pointed out that on

10

one complained of, there was another item in the news about

11

two people unconnected with this crackdown who were arrested

12

and held in $35,000 bail for transporting hard-core pornography.

13

He didn't even know whether in advising the newscaster that

14

this was what was in there in the evening news, whether it

15

referred to the Rosenbloom group or whether it referred to the

16

other group, and there is not a word of testimony in the record

17

by anybody on the subject.

18

Now, what was the offensive broadcast, Your Honors?

19

It says, at page 350 of the record, that a jury of six men and

20

six women -- it is the third paragraph, if Your Honors are

21

looking at it, 350A

22

special investigation squad -- the second item -- the special

23

investigation squad raided the home of Hr. Rosenbloom.

24

is a factual statement.

23

it says a jury of -- it says that the

Rosenbloom's home, and arrested him

on charges of possession of obscene literature.

they don't object to those two sentences.

and the one they object to.

5

also raided a barn in the 2000 block of Welsh Avenue, near

I suggest to Your Honors that if that is read in con­

text, then the alleged two preceeding sentences apply there, and

S

if it is read out of context, my friend, Mr. Clark, is again

10

in error in having said expressly that this said that Mr.

11

Rosenbloom rented the barn.

Q

What page is that?

A

This is page 350A, Your Honor, paragraph two.

16

So read in context, the word "allegedly'" simply carries over.

17

Read out of context, it doesn't apply to Rosenbloom at all.

18

turns out later, it was Rosenbloom's barn.

It

19

The final sentence, they don't object to, and that is

20

that Captain Ferguson says he believes they have hit the supply

21

of a main distributor of obscene material in Philadelphia, and

22

that is the whole broadcast, Your Honors.
Mow, then, what happened?

23

Within an hour it was

24

corrected.

There were six more broadcasts, there was one on

23

the half hour, and then there were six more broadcasts up to
9

1

8:00 a.m. in the morning -- every one of them put the word

2

'allegedly'

3

apparent at the very worst a slip of the pen to have left it

4

out, and at the very worst it was corrected within the hour.

5

Mr. Clark said some of the later broadcasts included it

S

every one of them, starting with 7:00 p.m. -- this was a 6:00

7

Mr. Clark said

yesterday that tills was not hot news, since the complaint had

been filed several days before.

There it is.

None of these broadcasts on October 21 or 25 named

the defendants.

If anyone had a recollection back to October 4

of these arrests*there is no way he could know whether it was

clear on that and has two witnesses on it.

8

there were complaints from many friends as to the WIP broad­

9

casts.

Mr. Clark said that

And so on October 27, he said* Mr. Roseribloom went to

10

WIP, was not permitted to see anyone but had one tape played

11

back.

12

That isn’t the story in the record at all.
The story in the record is that he went to a restaur­

13

ant where he met a friend named Chews who testified.

14

and Chews testified as to this.

15

heard a" — you see, he was in the magazine business -- "Say, I

that he heard this.

23

suggest to Your Honors it probably wasn’t our broadcast because

if you look at the broadcasts on October 21 and 25„ they don’t

25

mention arrests.

Rosenbloom said,

But he said

"Oh, that’s me."

How, I

But nevertheless this upset him and he made a
13

1

beeline to the station-

That is what sent him to the station.

2

And when he came to the station,, he said he wanted to

3

talk to somebody about a newscast, and they have a regular line

4

He wasn't denied anything.

was the day of the hearing -- "give me the one at noon.”
So the newscaster went and got him the one at noon.

13
14

Sow,

the testimony in the record of what tvas read, admittedly

IS

it was this one, so X would like to read lour Honors what was

16

reas to him.

This is the broadcast at noon on November 21st:

17

"The United States District Court" —

18

Q

What page is that?

19

A

Page 387A, the first item, was the 9® second br©s a-

20

cast.

2?

It reads as follows:

22

These broadcasts run from 90 seconds to 10 minutes.

"in Federal Court today, two publishers and a dis­

23

tributor of alleged smut literature will go before Judae Could"

24

-- that was in error, it wasn't Judqe Gould -- "claimina they

25

are suffering economic and financial hardship because of a
14

1

recant crackdown on such material."
1 suggest to Your Honors that there was nothing in

2
3

that to upset him.

4

what he said concerning the United States Attorney is entirely

5

true.

s

that the District Attorney had said something, and here is what

7

he said.

8

and I quote him,

9

about them"

10

But. his response that the court spoke about

He said to the newscaster — rather the District Attorney,

The District Attorney says that ray publications are,
"absolutely legal, absolutely nothing obscene

that is at 137A of the record ~~ "absolutely

legal, absolutely nothing obscene about them."

11

Well, here was a newscaster, he said there was a

12

public statement fey the District Attorney; he knew, one, the'-e

13

was no public statement.

that Judge Lord found in the whole 1ecord,

this is what it said about that:

10

The evidence of the incident lacked both sufficient substance

Is there a special Pennsylvania rule applicable

No, Your Honor,

There is of court action, it is not as liberal

What is the Pennsylvania rule?

The rule is that you are charged with truth.

22

Q

I would like to ask you one more question

fore you sit down.

be­

I am not clear, are you claimina that the

Times in the Sullivan rule should be extended to this case?
A

I am. saying, Mr. Justice Harlan,

that when Your

23

Honors extended the Times ease from the public officials,

24

the public figure, that what all of the scholars have said, and

25

what all of the lower court judges have said is the fact, that

for

25
!

1

Your Honors are necessarily extending it to where issues of

2

what Your Honor called substantial and important public interest:

3

were involved* that in those issues the actual malice standard

4

would be applied.

5

Now* Your Honors have used the word "or" and you have

8

used the word "and, 5‘ and 1 don't stand on that.

7

stand on the fact that anyone who reads those opinions would

8

conclude what the scholars have uniformly concluded, %-jhat this

9

court of appeals concluded, what the court of appeals in the

I would rather

10

McLean case concluded, what the court of appeals in United

n

Medical concluded, that Your Honors, when you left the post of

12

public official and went to public fiqure, you we*-e in effect

13

saying that the public's right to know extended to public

14

issues of importance of significant matters.

15

Q

Then that means that any newspaper or radio

16

station can pick out any one of the 20C million Joe Dokes and

17

justify the fact that they have printed a news story that is

18

false, a false comment, as long as it is not malicious within

19

the terras of the rule, th©.fc they would be protected as long

20

as --

21

A

No, I would not say that, Your Honor.

22

G

Because the newspaper itself creates a public

23

figure, take any Joe Dokes in the country and create an immunity

24

for itself under the statute in publishing a false story.

25

h

May I give you the corollary of that and then

come back, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Take the Walker situation.

13

enough to be a public figure, probably not as to the student

14

leader, but certainly not as to the anonymous man."

15

16

Now,

"Well, we can publish safely

How could

I say that if Your Honors could show that in

'17

order to involve an individual they created a public issue,

18

think probably that might demonstrate actual malice.

19

you have an individual who becomes involved in something the

20

public has the right to know,

21

the First Amendment demands that it be held for fault but that

22

that fault be calculated falsehood or a wreckless disregard.

4

perils because I would accept the test that this Court has set

5

dov/n in different language.

S

Mr. Justice Harlan used, in which he said that it had to be a

7

matter of significant and important interest to the public, I

8

think that is right.

even as to a public official, let alone a public figure.

review is indicated in the nature of the argument on rebuttal.

It is clearly in the record, page

minutes after they began.

I describe them not as a single

series but as two series that over a period of time occupied
almost a month, beginning October 4 and 5 and picking up aoairs
October 22 and going to November 1.
I think his reference to the record where Mr.
Roseribloan met someone in a cafe who described the broadcast
that he heard and his reaction shows the real problem of the
little man.

Mr. Clark, there may be a difference between a

5

newspaper and a radio in thi3 respect, because of the obliga­

tion of radio to give equal time, an obligation that i s not

7

shared by a newspaper, and that obligation means that you*clienfc would have, or his friends and supporters, would have

9

access to the radio, wouldn't it?
A

1

1 think the equal time theory in the law shows

1!

that we are prepared to require the radio to try to be fair,

12

but equal time refers to opinions really, the editorialisation.

13

Now, this did smack of sensationalism, in the views of the

14

trial judge, and it was editorialising.

15

there has been any extension of equal time to the idea that in

news reporting, people as to whom news is reported have an op­

portunity to come on and say something.

21

As to the masses of our people, they don't have any opportunity

if it is, if it is, then it certainly requires no more, no

Pennsylvania common law rule as it now does provide.

That would perhaps be my argument as an advocate

in fchis case.

view as a lawyer, my view of it as a lawyer is that the con­

4

stitution does provide some protection to freedom of the press

5

and freedom of discussion, even of the little people.

important to the discovery of truth, too.

7

going to discuss the little people, you are going to have to

exercise reasonable care, because the little man can’t show

Bo 1 correctly infer from what you said that

your suggested test where the private citizen is involved

would be a test applicable only where the alleged libeler is

a newspaper or other member of the news media?

*8

for example, between private citizens where a liebeler is, say,

20

A

Yes, it would, Mr. Justice.

Would it apply,

My view is that

21

the central purpose, as you stated so beautifully, the First

22

Amendment is the activities of government, that they really be

23

open to full, vigorous discussion and debate so that the truth

24

may be known.

that actually defames them and injures them and puts them out

of business,, you are going to have to use reasonable care, be­

4

cause we do have that regard for the individual here, too.
Q

5

Why should there be any constitutional rule at

6

all, federal constitutional law at all as between private

7

persons, whereas one person is liable to another person?

8

shouldn't just the existing law of libel be permitted to stand?
A

Why

Well, I don't think the Court needs to reach

50

that case here, and I am sure that it won't feel that duty it­

have some room there, but we do need reasonable care, because

14

it is awfully important that the press exercise care, too, it

15

is a concentration we have there, if there is no standard of

The first two sentences would probably be all

right under the protection of the First Amendment.

12

they are reporting a news story,

But the second two involve quite different considerations, but

14

the headline begins with the characterisation "C^akdown on

else.

7

out of context, can we really assume that the radio audience

A

How much?

For the actual damages or general damages, as

16

they are called in Pennsylvania, $25,000, and the punitive

17

damages, as reduced by the miniature to $250,000.

18

Q

You are not asking for the entire $750,000?

1®

A

Wo, sir.

20

Q

On what basis do you think the court had a ^ight

21
22

to reduce it to $750,000,
A

if your argument is --

Your Honor, we haven't really raised in our pe­

23

tition for certiorari the power of the court to reduce it, and

24

in — or in the court below, so if that is -- that is something

25

that is really not here on the record.

The only

other test X can sea is the newsworthy test, the issue test,

and X don't believe distinctions can be made there.

5

when the news broadcasts something, it is ipso facto news­

6

worthy, and I think really what defamation is about is people

7

and reputations, and that is where the hard line will have to

3

be drawn between the private people -- we are not within the

have got to decide whether the man is a public figure?

Well, at first, if he is a public official, I

17

think that is pretty clear.

18

then the test might be whether his history has been such that

1

the story could not have been meaningfully reported without

20

his inclusion, where there is something about it -- how could

you report the University of Georgia football story without
