ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE-

FOE UNITED STATES

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

^qo.

MR. LAWRENCE G. WALLACE; Thank you, Mr. Chief

8

Justice. If it please the Court, I would like to take a some­

&

what indirect approach now, to the statutory issue that I began

10

t© discuss yesterday. While this may seam a bit roundabout, I

11

believe it will serve to help clarify our position in this

12

case.
I'd like to start by reminding the Court of the terms

13
14

of the statutory provision of the 1866 act that were before it,

15

two terms ago, in Jones against Mayer and Company, that's now

W

Section 1982 of Title 42, which reads, "All citizens of the

17

United States shall' have the same right in every State and

18

Territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof, to inherit,

'19

purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal pro­

20

perty." And a similar provision of the 186S act, with respect

21

to Entering into contracts, and suing and being sued is now in

22

Section 1981.
There is in the complaint in the present case an al­

23
24

legation thatcs rather similar in its terms. At least in what

25

we deem to be a crucial term, and that is on page 6 of the Ap~

1

4

i

pendix, in paragraph 12« There’s an allegation that by this

Z

conspiracy the Defendants"have willfully and maliciously in-

3

timidated and prevented the Plaintiffs from enjoying and

4

exercising" going down to the bottom of this paragraph, “their

5

rights to travel the public highways without restraint in the

6

same terras that white citizens in Kemper County, Mississippi.”

7

Now 1 believe this similarity has some relevance

a

because of the threat of continuity that runs through the adop­

9

tion of all three of these amendments to the Constitution, and

m

through the whole series of legislation, through the 1866, 1870

ii

and 1871 Acts, and even the 1875 Act, which is not involved

12

here.

13

The overriding purpose behind all of these provisions,

14

and it colors the way they should be read and interpreted, as

15

this Court has said many times, was to acheive & meaningful

16

emancipation, for the former slaves, in various aspects of com­

1?

munity life.

18

This was certainly a purpose to be achieved in the

1®

1870 legislation, and when Congress was made aware -that the

20

activities of the KtS MXux Klan and other private conspirators,

21

were interfering with the achievement of this objective, Congress

22

went on, in 1871, to enact the legislation that is now before us ,

23

that this Court is asked to interpret in this case.

24
25

The first section of that lagislationiis now Section
1.983 of Title 42, and that is quoted on page 10 of our brief,

2
5

!

ourgrey covered brief, in this ease. That provided that every

£

person, who under color

3

custom, or. usage of any State or Territory, under color - of

4

law, subjects, or-causes to be subjected, any citizen of.the

5

United States, or other person within the jurisdiction thereof,

6

to the depravation of any rights, priveledges, or immunities

7

secured by the Constitution and laws, is liable to a suit for

8

damages.

9

of any statute, ordinanee, regulation,

Now that covered liability by public officials, who

10

acting under color of law, have deprived deplainants of

11

rights under the Constitution, including Fourteenth Amendment

12

rights. This Court has several times held that this statute

•13

applies to Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as to other

H

rights, in Screws against the United States, Monroe against

15

Pape, and so forth.

W

That was not, as this Court noted last term in its

17

opinion in Adi ekes againut Kress ■£ Co,, that was not the most

18

controversial provision of the 1871 legislation. It was Section

19

II in which Congress went on to reach, at least in turns, actions

20

that are not taken under color of law, that provoked the con­

21

troversy o
And before proceeding to Section II I want to say

22
23

one other thing about Section 1983,, Not only did it reach ac­

24

tions by public officials, and make them subject to suit for

23

damages, it also extended, it has been held a number of times,
3
6

1

to actions by private persons taken, in concert with public of-

2

facials, those, too, are actions taken under color of l^w, as

3

this Court held with respect to the comparable criminal provision

4

in United .States against Price. And a number of Court of Appeals

5

cases have held the same thing with respect, to 1983 and a foot­

6

note in the Price oponion indicates that this is an accurate

7

analysis.

8

So with this in mind, as well as accomplished in Sec­

9

tion one of the legislation, 1 think we can turn to an analysis

10

of what did Section Two of the same law add. Nov; Section two is

11

insofar as we’re concerned with it, the civil part of Seciton

12

two is now the provision before us. Section 1985 - 3 of Title

13

42. It’s set forth in full on page 2 of our brief, but I think

14

for purposes of our discussion, it will be sore convenient to

15

refer to page 7 of our brief, in which we have quoted from the

16

Collins opinion, this Courts'

17

visions with numbering added to it, that are covered in 1985-3.

adambation of the various pro­

m

Here is where the Congress gave attention to the ac­

n

tivities of private conspitators, it attempted to provide re­

20

dress in order,to, as I said at the outset, achieve the mean­

21

ingful emancipation that was the overriding objective.

22

One of the things that Congress provided redress for

23

were conspiracies by two or more persons, in the part numbered

24

two here, on page 7, to prevent or hinder the constituted auth­

23

orities from giving or securing to all persons the equal pro4

7

s

2

though it might not be conspiratorial

5

ence with their providing equal protection is covered by that

6

part of 1985-3»

7

,

not be taken in concert,

,

even though

Interference in concert is already cowered in Section

Q

1 of the Act, as I said. And then the parts numbered three and

9

four provide specific protections against conspiracies to int­

!0

erfere with voting in federal elections and campaigning in fed­

11

eral elections.

12

Now the question remaining, and the key question in

13

this case, is what does the first part add to these pro­

14

visions? What further meaning is there in the first part, of 1985 ■*

15

3? Our approach

10

something, and not be merely redundant of what is enacted right

17

along with it.

18

to any statute is that each part, must mean

How can two or more private persons conspire without

19

in some way acting under color of law in concert with public

20

officials so as to deprive any person or' class of persons of

21

equal protection of the laws or of equal priveledges and im­

22

munities under the laws? They don't have the authority to do

23

that.

24
25

That is the concepetual difficulty with trying to
attuibute a meaning to this part of the statute that goes beyond
5

8

1

what Congress had already don®»

2

In some ways it's very similar to the diffuculfcy

3

that the three justices of the Court in Screws against the

4

United States, and Mr» Justice Frankfurtanrin Monroe against

a

Pape had with the question of how can a state official acting

6

contrary to state law be depriving an individual of rights

7

that the state guarantees him.

8

It's a rather similar conceptual difficulty and indeed

9

the answer which this Court gave in the Collins opinion is very

10

similar to the answer to that other question which was given in

II

the dissenting opinion in Screws against the United wtates

12

and in the dissenting opinion inMonsoe against Pape.
The answer, the key language of the answer, can be

13
14

found on page 8 of our brief, the very next page, in the middle

15

of the page, in the paragraph set forth in the middle of the

16

page, the second sentence of that paragraph points out that

17

"the negative answer of the Collins opinion said that unless

18

the law or its agencies

19

to the private conduct, the victims5 rights/' this is quoting

20

from Collins, "The victims rights under the laws, and the pro™

El

tection of the laws remain untouched and equal to the rights

22

of every other person within the State", and that is why the

23

Collins opinion, in effect, reads this part of 1985-3 as merely

24

redundant of 1983, as really accomplishing the same thing.

were to give sanction or sancutary

But if we look back at the language of the statute

25
6

9

1

again, the statute doesn't say that the wrong is to deprive

2

someone as Collins said of the rights to ’equal protection under

3

the laws , that9s not what the statute says.

4

The statute says conspiracy to deprive them of the

5

equal protection of the reality, not the right, as Mr, Justice

&

Brennan pointed out in his opinion in Adickes, the only way

7

to deprive someone of the equal protection of the laws would

8

be to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment„
That couldn't be what Congress had in mind, no private

9
10

persons could accomplish that. So the question in our mind

n

becomes what is it that private persons conspiring together

V2

can do that would deprive someone of the meaningful enjoyment

'13

of these guarantees that the Constitution had added as against

n

the states? Besides interfering with the conduct of public of­

15

ficials which is covered in the second part here?
What is it besides that that private persons could

W

17

do that would interfere with the enjoyment of these rights?
Well, one fairly obvious thing, to refer to a problem

18
19

that is again before this Court, this term, would be if there

20

were a school desegregation order, and private persons conspired

21

together to prevent children because of their race from attending

22

a particular school. Intercepted them, prevented them from

23

getting there.
That would not be action taken under color of law,

24

25

it would bot be action taken in concert with public officials.
7
10

1

Ye t is seems to us that it would be a deprevation of

z

enjoyment of the right to equal protection of the laws that—"

3

Q

There are many ways of getting at that, aren't

4

there? Many other ways than relying oh a statute of this kind

5

to reach the hypothetical you just suggested.

6

A

There undoubtedly are, but Congress was concerned

7

in enacting this very statute that other ways that might be

0

available, other legal remedies, such as remedies in the states,

9

might not pr>oove effective to protect the rights that they

10

were trying to confer.

I!

Q

12

Well, I'm speaking of Federal. Aren't there many

other federal remedies for this hypothetical?
A

18

Well, there would be remedies connected with a

n

Court Order, if the desegregation were being accomplished under

VJ

a Court Order.

16
n

Q

Aren't there Federal Statutes about obstructing

A

There would be the possibility of a federal

justice?

18
IS

statute. I'm not sure, however, that if all that were involved

20

wdre a plan voluntarily adopted by a school board to comply

21

with the law of the land, a school board not under court order,

22

that any federal statute about obstructing justice would be

23

applicable.

24

Q

23

Well, your hypothetical is altered a little bit

now.
8

11

1

A

Welly in response to your question» But it seems

2

to me that it would still be within the outreach of this pro­

3

vision» The concern of Congress was with the possibility that

4

the rights would not be enjoyed because private persons would

15

prevent their enjoyment»

0

As & matter of fact, there is a very specific refer­

7

ence to this in the legislative history of the amendment adding

0

the woffid "equal" which Mr. Pollack spoke about yesterday»

0

lsd like to refer the Court to that history, these

10

are remarks by Representative Garfield, later the President

1!

of the United States, in support of this amendment, and in

12

support of the provision that was then enacted» The consequence

13

of this amendment, and this is not quoted in the brief, un­

14

fortunately, it appears on page 153 of the Congressional Globe,

15

42nd Congress, first session»

16

These remarks, incidentally, were cited, although these

1?

particular ones were not quoted in Mr» Justice Brennans® opinion

18

in Adickes»

19

Representative Garfield said there, in support of the

20

amendment, I quote now, "To state the case in the most moderate

21

terms, it appears that in some of the Southern States, there

22

exists a widespread secret organisation, whose members are

23

bound together by solemn oath to prevent certain classes of

24

citizens, of the United States, from enjoying their new rights,

25

these new rights confered upon them by the Constitution and the
9
.12

!

laws, and they are putting into execution their design of pre­

£

venting such citizens from emjoying the free light of the bal­

3

lot box and other priveledges and immunities of citizens, and

4

from enjoying the equal protection of the laws*,”

5

Q

—-staturory view that you take, what do you con-

Q

ceed to be the constitutional source of power to sustain that

7

kind of a statute?

8
9

A

Well, we argue in our brief that as applied here,

the Thirteenth Amendment is applicable to this application, and

'IO

that the .Fourteenth Amendment, the enforcement provisions of

1?

both of those amendments would be the relevant provisions.

12

13

If I may, Mr. Justice, I8d like to get to that in
just a moment——

14

Q

Yes.

15

A

After I finish the statutory analysis and its

16

applicability to this case —

17

Q

Yes.

18

A

As we see it. Given that much meaning of the

1©

statute, we say that even that applies here, because the

20

allegation is of a terroristic, coercive interference with the

21

use of public highways. Thatss exactly what happened here, in

22

fact it's not terribly different from some of the activities of

23

the Klan during the period in which Congress was' enacting this

24

legislation.
We think, really, that the right should probably be

25
10

13

I

formulated in more basic terms than that.

a

We don’t think it would really make a difference in

s

■this case , if the interception had occured in a private drive­

4

way rather than on a public road, as this Court noted in Jones

5

against Mayer Co»f one of the rights that Congress «as concerned

§

to accomplish through the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment

7

and the 1866 legislation, and we say there’s a threat of conf

0

tiruiity running through here, was to see to it that the newly

9

emancipated Negroes would have, in Senator Trumbulls words that

10

were there quoted, freedom to go and. come at pleasure.

11

12

And certainly the kind of freedom to go and coins for
>
this class of persons that would be upheld for white persons

13

and ordinary persons in the community is of the escence of

14

accomplishing a meaningful emancipation.

IS

Of changing peoples status from a subjugated status

16

to a free status, and this is why it seems to us that what

17

Congress was trying to do was to protect persons from private

18

conspiracies directed against them because of their membership

19

in a class, because of their race or other comparable membership

20

in a class„ directed toward keeping them in an inferior status,

2!

preventing them from enjoying these rights in the public sec­

22

tor, as we say in our brief, that others in the community have

23

the right. Under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments against

24

the State to enjoy.
Now it seems to us that the Courts opinion in Jones

23

11
14

1

practically points the way to the application of the Thirteenth

a

Amendment to sustain the statute, to get back to Mr. Justice

3

Harlans question.

4

Q

As a source of Congressional power—

5

A

As a source of Congressional! power.

6

Q

7

The —* is that in Jones there was an explicit

language about buying and isaliing property, real and personal,

a

A

Well, that’s why: I thought our real problem here

10

Q

With the statute.

11

A

With the statute, and I think this is what the

9

was—

12

statute must have meant, and then this kind of application, it

13

seems to us, is sustained there; by the constitutional analysis

14

in Jones, And we see no problem with upholding this application

15

without reaching the question of other possible applications.

16

After all, this is not a criminal statute where we

17

need worry as much about notice from a restrictive pleading of

18

it and it seems to me that the principles of United States

19

against Raines apply a sort of a forti-orari to a , civil Statute

20

of this kind.

21

Q

My only difficulty, well not my only difficulty

22

because 1 have many in this case, but with the statutory lang­

23

uage it's certainly difficult, for me at first blush to see how

24

it covers this case, where the facts were that two brothers who

25

were of the white rase, crashed their car into another car and

beat up the five occupants of the

allegation that the assualt was to prevent these persons because

6

of their race,, from era joying the same right to use the public

8

this comity.
That that was the reason for the assualt, coercion

15

because he was Negro.
.

16

A

Well, we do say in our brief that this purpose

17

to keep in an inferior status probably can be inferred in most

18

such instances where that’s the inteat, but here, where there's

us away from the immediate context for a minute, and let's see

the people living there, and they, in one way or another, by

picketing, by threats, intimidation, banded together, more

than three of them, to prevent -the worshippers of that group,

having nothing to do with Negro and white problems, to prevent

sistance in this ease, and is the basis for authority. Six

4

justices in the Goss case said, that the Fourteenth Amendment

5

will support federal legislation punishing all conspiracy with

6

or without state action that interfere with .fourteenth Amend­

7

ment rights, that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights»

S
9
fO

And I don’t think that that principle means that
Congress thereby is empowered to reach every possible tort of
Strains under state law.
The formulation itself indicates a limitation on its

ii
12

applicability, its interference with the rights of the Fourteenth

13

Amendment, protects against the states. We’re not dealing here

14

in an area where a state has, pursuant to some' new principle,

15

relegated decision making to private persons, which is the .kind

16

of thing that the court was concerned with in the civil rights

17

cases o
This is not that kind of area.» It’s not freedom to

18

19

come and go in somebody elses’place» It's freedom to come and

20

go on the public thoroughfases» And we are dealing with class

21

discriminations, with the new right that was established in the

22

Fourteenth Amendment, the right to equality that the sponsors

23

of the Amendment and the sponsors of the legislation thought

24

because of its newness would need special federal nurture and

25

federal protection.

Q

Would you agree, Mr. Wallace, that had this case

2

gone to trial, or one like it, that there is a threshold oblig­

3

ation on the Plaintiff to proove the existence of conspiracy?

4

It isn't just the conduct—

5

A

That'S right.

S

Q

Now, presumably, if the ligitation took the

7

course of most conspiracy-based oases, they would have to Call

a

on the Defendants for testimony.

9

Suppose these Defendants just declined to testify on

10

the grounds of the Fifth Amendment, and no other testimony about

11

a conspiracy was forthcoming except such as the Plaintiffs

12

might offer by way of their own conclusions.

13

Would you agree that that would lead directly to a

14

verdict, very likely?

15

A

Well, I think—

16

Q

In favor of the Defendants?

17

A

“-—that a conspiracy can be prooved, by proof

18

of concerted conduct and the inferences that should be drawn

19

from the conduct, and—
Q

20

Well would you chink that when two men attack

21

two other men, or one isther, that conduct alone would establish

22

a conspiracy?
A

23

Well, this wasn't a mere attack, Mr. Chief Jus­

24

tice. This was an interception of the car. They cut off this

25

car on a public highway, and proceeded at gun point to remove
18

21

1

these people from the oar and attack them.

2
3

Q

Welly that evidence would be equally directed

toward establishing some criminal conduct, wouldn't it? State
criminal conduct.
A

5
6

Welly there may be more reason to read a con­

spiracy law more narrowly when criminal sanctions are involved.
Here we have an effort by Congress to provide civil

7

a

redress for interference with the enjoyment of rights that

9

Congress was trying to confer on these people and it's apparent

10

that damage was done* through a concerted’ action which at least

13

the trier of that could infer involved some conspiratorial de­

12

sign between the actors.
I don't see why a civil statote should be read more

13
14

strictly thafc that. The object, was to provide redress for

15

damages, and damages were done, here.
Q

16

Well, what I was getting at in part, at least,

17

was that you probably could have cases where enormous damages

18

could be shown, but the case might fail because of want of evi­

19

dence of a conspiracy.

20

A

Well, perhaps so, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't

Q

That might be either by the action of the triers,

21

this case.

22

23

®r it might be by action of the Court. 1 just wanted to separate

24

proof of conspiracy from proof of the damages.
A

25

That6s proper, Your Honor.

19
22

i

Q

Very well.

2

A

Thank you.

Q

Thank you* Mr. Wallace. Mr. Moore?

ARGUMENT OF W. D, MOORE* ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

6

1

MR. W. D. MOOREs Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please
the court.

Q

B

It is alleged that on July 2, 1966* which happened
to be a Sunday afternoon* the Claimants in this cause were trav­

10

elling down a public road. That they were intercepted by the

1!

Respondents* in this cause* and that a confrontation occured*

12

whereby it is alleged that assualfc was made and physical dam­

13

ages dome fco

14

the Petitoners.

And as a result from that* the Petitioners filed a

15

suit in the State Court in Kemper County* Mississippi, that

!6

case is still pending* it hasn't be tried* but anyway it's on

11

the docket* it’s still pending.

18

They also filed a complaint in the Eastern Division

19

&<£ the Sourthen District of Mississippi* federal jurisdiction*

20

and the cause came on fco be heard upon the motion of the Re­

21

spondents fco dismiss the case* because the declaration had

22

wholly f ailed fciO state a cause of action’in that it did not

23

allege an action under color of law.

24

25

The decision of the District Judge was appealed to
the Fifth Circuit* for the Fifth Oistrict * and the Circuit Court

20
23

I

affirmed the ruling of theDistrict Judge holding that there had

2

been no action# no alleged damages commited under color of law.

3
4

Then the case was appealed to this Body» And we“re
here today for that»

5

Q

Keep your voice up a little please,

6

A

Thank you# Mr, Justice» The only issue# as I

7

see it to be determined by this Court is whether the lower

8

court was correct in affirming# in dismissing the cause of action

9

because it failed to state that the alleged acts were commited

m

under color of law.

ii

Now this Court has settled the matter# in my opinion#

12

and in Collins vs, Hardyman# and some of the members of this

13

Court were here when the case was decided»
What we have# allegedly# is that these people were

4
5
18
7

grievously treated# if the allegations of the complain^ are
correct. And that their rights would be violated# but it is the
opinion of the Court ira Collins vs. Handyman--—
Q

!8

9

you mean their rights under the statute?

20

2!

When you say their rights would be violated#

A

Their individual rights # not their rights under

Q

Well in order to have rights# it seems to me# it

the law c

22

23

has to be under the law# that’s what rights and obligations

24

are all about.
A

25

That’s right with regard to law and justice# but

2
24

1

I’m speaking of equality of rights under the law,

2
3

Q

tort law in Mississippi»

4
S

I thought you were talking about rights under

A

No* sir, 1 just didn8fc express myself correctly,

I was trying to read from Collins vs, Handyman»

6

Q

Well, Mr, Moore, assuming for the moment that

7

the allegations of this complaint were in a complaint in an ac­

8

tion in the STafce Court, with all other jurisdiction unquesioned

0

would there be any doubt that they had asserted a tort: action

10

against the Defendants?

11

they can support——

12

13

A

If the allegations are correct, and

Under the State, I believe, Mr, Chief Justice

that it would state a tort action»
i

14

.

Q

There couldnet be much question about that, could

16

A

Wo, sir.

17

Wall, as a matter of fact, as 1 said before, they

15

there?

18

have donfe that» There is a case arising out of the alleged facts

19

in this, in the state court»

20

Q

Has it been tried?

2!

A

No, sir»

22

It was filed shortly after the alleged incident oceurec

23

and for various reasons, I don3t know why, it hasnst been tried,

24

but they have it still on -the docket»

23

Wow in the case in the state court, I think they state
22
e*;

!

a cause of action»

2

But what this Court is concerned with, and what my

3

understanding is, that if the acts were taken to be true, their

4

rights were certainly invaded. Disregarded and lawlessly vio­

3

lated ,

6

But neither their rights nor their equality of rights

7

under the law, have been or were or intended to be denied or

8

impaired. That5s the position of the Respondents in this mat­

9

ter.

10

Mow reference has been made to the Guestcase and the

?!

Pries case. Well they were criminal cases, and indictment was

12

obtained, and among other things, in the indictment it was

13

charged that they committed these acts under color of. law, I

14

don't think that that would be applicable to our case here,
Q

15

$he Guestcase, I think it had two branches, I'm

16

talking now about the opinion of the Court, not the concurring

17

opinion, one branch of it was that there was an official state

?8

action, but aquite a separate and distinct branch of the case

19

was that there was private action interfering with a. right that

20

Congress had the constitutional power to protect, that was the

2!

right of interstate travel.

22

Do you remember, have you read the Guest opinion?

23

A

Yes, sir. That qould be correct,

24

Q

And as to that second branch it etspjLicifcXy, per­

2S

haps not clearly, held that there need not be state involvement

23

26

1

when the federal right interfered with is the right of inter­

2

state travel* because that is a right that doss not derive* ne­

3

cessarily* from the Fourteenth Amdnement* that’s a right that

4

Congress can protect against interference by privsifce action,

0

A

Yes* sir,

6

Q

So* to that extent* the opinion of the

court in

7

Guest doesn’t require color of law or state involvement in any

8

way, when the federal right interfered with is the right of

9

interstate travel.

SO

Am I correct?

II

A

12

s

13

freely down an interstate highway, isn’t there?
*A

14
15

Well* there’s an allegation here about traveling

I don’t Jnow whether it used the word "interstate1

or not. It said on the local—
Q

16
17

Q

That’s as 1 understand it* yes, sir,

Well, it’s on page 6* paragraph 12, "The right to

travel the public highways”. It's on page 6 of the Appendix,

18

A

Yes, sir,

I don’t have that before me

right now,

19

Q

Of* course the Guest case, which perhaps for

the

20

first time made it explicit that the right of interstate tra­

21

vel was a right that Congress had the power to protect not only

22

against state interference but also against private interference

23

that holding* that was in the Guest case, which came after

24

Collins against Hardyman* didn't it?
A

23

Yas* sir,

24
27

1

Q

1 wonder if you think that has any significance,

2

or that that, since that was a right that had. not been chrystal-

3

Xized, or made clear at the time of the decision in Collins

4

against Hardyman.,

5
6

A

Well, I just donst, to be frank with you, Mr„

Justice Brennan. I mean Justice Stewart, I don’t know.

7

But we have placed our defense on the case of Collins

8

?4md we believe that it’s a landmark case, that the issue has

9

been tried and settled by this Court, unless there's some

10

further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, we rest our case on Collins;;

n

vs. Hardyman„

Thank You.
