MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We'll hear
arguments next in No. 362, McGee against the Uni~ed States.
Mr. Levine.
ARGUMENT OF ALAN H. LEVINE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LEVINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8
9
10

it please the Court.
This case is before you on Writ of Certiorari to

11

the Second Circuit. Petitioner seeks review of convictions on

12

4 counts, under the I1ilitary Selective Sefvice Act, 1967.

13

Tho cbief question presented by this petition .l:s

14

the question left open in McKart v, the United States. It

15

presents the pure question of whether, where a registrant

16

presents a claim for consciencious objection, and that claim

17

is denied, without a basis in fact, as the Second Circuit con-

18

ceeds here, it was so denied, where therefore the classieication

19

the I-A classification, and the induction order, were illegal,

20

is he barred from challenging that classification and induction

21

order in judicial review?

22

In answering that question "no", \te wi:Cl assert two

23

basic propositions. One, that the exhaustion of administrative

24

remedies doctrine is inappropriately applied, where, as McKart

25

suggested, its effect is not merely to delay jud::.cial review,
4

t

but is to deny it completely.

2

~.nd we will defend secondly, the proposition that

3

if exhaustion of administrative ren.edies is to be applied so

4

harshly, it must be applied with Congr£.ssional mandate. And

5

that the Militax:y Selective Service Act of :_967 to the contrary

6

does not limit judicial -:-eview, in defr.nse to a criminal pro·-

7

secution, but in fact guarantees judic.i al review in defense ·co

8

a criminal prosecution.

9

Petitioner at ·che time of induction was a full time

to

s t udent at Unitm Theological Seminary. He had registered for

It

the draft in August of 1961, in New York City, he had advised

12

his local board at that time that he was preparing for the

1.3

ministry.

74

In August, 1964, he enrolled in the University of

15

Rochester and the next month was given a II-S del'errment, fo:,:-

16

all practical purposes kept that deferi:ment m11:il September

17

1167.

In February 1966, while still at the University of

18

19

Rochester and still possessing a II-S classification, he appliad

20

for conscien cous

21

local board deferred consideratf_on of that application until h.;i

22

was no longer entitled to a lower clasEification.

23

objec:tor status, pursuant to regulations, th~

In March of 1966, he got a letter from the local

24

board to that effect, that they would cefer consideration of

25

his

c.o.

classificatS.on.
5

1

In April of 1967, he was still at Rochester, still

2

possessing a II-s, Petitioner wrote tile President of the

3

United States. He enclosed in that letter remnanta of a tern

4

and burnt draft card.
Q

6

Now was he convicted of some criminal act

in conneciton with that?

7

A

He ,,,as not, nor was he indicted in the

8

indictments under review here. Subsequent to the trial in ·.:his

9

case, he was indicted on 2 counts of destroying a draft card.

10

Those cases have not come to trial, Your Honor.

11

Q

That question isn't forced, at all?

12

A

It is not, Your Honor.

13

He wrote the President in April, 1969, and he ad-

14

vised the President that he would probably be em:itled to a

15

theologiaal deferrrnent, nevertheless, he said, "I mus 1: sever

16

every

t1

"fundc:.roental belief that men must build and not destroy, love

18

and not hate." As a result he said that he could no longer

19

cooperate with the Selective Service System.

link with violence a.nd war.• He expressed, again quoting,

20

In June of 1967·, upon his graduation f:rom Rochester,

21

he was sent a currer.~ information questionnaire. SSS Form 127.

22

He returned that questionnaire unopened and said that he would

23

return all future correspondence unopened.

24
25

In September, 1967, he was classified I-A, despite
his pending C.O. application. He returned that I-A classificatic
6

1

card,

2

Q

Now that c,o, application that you just

3

characterized as pending, is one that was filed Hhile he was

4

a student at the University of Rochester?

That's right, In March of 1966--3 years earlier, 3~years earliert
No, this was in September 1967 that I:m

talking about.

9

Q

A year and a half, approximately,

10

A

Right,

11

Q

And at that time the board had indicatad

12

that since he had a II-S student deferrment, thera was no

13

need for them to consider the C.O. application?
A

14

In March of 1966, The board chairnan

15

testified at trial somewhat ambiguously, and as a result of

16

his testimony, as to what the board did in March 66, and Sep-

17

tember, 67, that led Judge Feinberg to conclude that in fact

18

the board had never considered the application on its merits,

t9

That in September of 1967, according to the board

20

chairmans testimony, they had just reaffirmed their earlier

21

decision,

22

Q

Why did they send him the information form?

23

A

Presumably because they were aware from his

24

25

earlier request for a II-S that he was going to graduate.
O

And r.f he had responded to that form there
7

1

would have been a place to talk about his current status, I

2

suppose.

If he had told the board at that time that

he was no longer entitled to a II-S, preswr.ably, in the couise
of normal procedures, the board t•ould bave considered his CO
applicaiton at that time. This current information questionnai1e
does not contain feference to conscientious objection.
He would have advised ~hem, "I've gradu.ted, I'm
entitlud, I'm no longer entitled to II-S" therefore the boarc
would have seen in his file that he had a pending CO application
Presumably, according to the board chail:mans somewhat
ambiguous testtmony, that is what they did, in Sepl:ember of 1967

8

They considered his entire file, and his co appli2

cation. As I said, Judge Feinberg thinks that they did not

3

consider his application on the merits atall, the trial juage,

4

however, found that as a matter of fact, at the close of the

5

trial that the application had been considered.

Petitioner did not appeal that classifi::a.tion. Later

11

that month, he enrolled in Unicn Theological Seminary, In

12

October of 1967 he was ordered to--Q

13

Did he recieve his I-A classification, i.e.

Y4 did he not send it back unopened?
15

A

He did sent it back unopened, Your Honor.

16

Q

So he didn't even know that h,? 'd been

17

classified I-A, is that xight?
A

t8

Presumably ha dld not. He sent back the

10

I-A undpened, later that month enrolled in Union Theological

20

Seminai:y.

21

In October of 1967 he ~as sen~ an otder to report fox

22

physical examination. He returned that orde:c unopc?I'.ed. He was

23

ordered to report for induction in Jan~ary of 1969. He filled

24

out a number of forms at that ti 1e giving a 1/'a.. iety of different j

25

kinds cf information at that time. He took a corr.pleb? physical
9

1 examination.
2

Q

So he did open that envelope.

3

A

Pardon?

4

Q

He did open that envelope?

5

A

He did open that envelope. He reported as

6 ordered to report, he gave the required informetion, he took
7 the required physical examination, passed the physical examin0 ation, and refused to submit to induction.
9

Q

Now, that was the physical examination

to given at the, by the Selective Service, or by the military?
11

A

It's given by the military for the Belec-

12 ti ve Service. It's given at the Armed Forces Entrance and
13 ~xamining Station.
14

ts

q

At the time of induction,

, or quite a

hile before?
No, this was at the time of induction.

16

A

17

His file was then forwarded to the United States

18

ttorney, significantly, with a :recommendation by the Select:.v,?

t9

Service that he be indicted only on 2 counts, refusal of in-

20

uction and failure to possess his notice of class~fication.

21

Q

Is there any indication why he changed his

22

ind regarding how he would deal with mail addressed to him by

"23

is draft board?

24

A

~y he opened the---

25

Q

He sent several of them back, including his
10

I

I-A classification, sent back unopened.

2

A

I---

3

Q

And then when there arrived other com-

4

munication, one directing him to report for physical examinatior

5

he not only opened the communication but complied wit.1 it.

5

Is there any indication of why?

7

A

Not from the record Your Honor. I did not

0

represent Petitioner at the time, perhaps he spo~e to legal

9

counsel at that time, I donnot know and the record does not

10

indicate.

11

Despite the recommendation of Selertive service,

12

that he be prosecuted on 2 counts, in February of 1968 the

13

government sought and obtained a 4 count indictmant .

t4

The first connt was for refusal of induction.

15

The second was for refusal to take the physical

16
17

f8
19

20
21

examinatior.
The third was for failure to possess the 11otice of
classification.
The fourth, for failure to dubmit the informacion
requested on the classification for111.
Q

Incidentally, these notices af classificatic-

22

and to report for a physical, are they in sealed envelopes or

23

'
are they post
cards?

2A

A

25

Your Honor .

They are generally in envelopes, I believe,

11

Petitioner was found guilty .n January cf 1969, on

I

2

all 4 counts, sentenced to 2 year concurrent sentences on

3

each count. In March of 1970, the Second Circuit upheld the

4

convictions, Judge Feinberg dissented.

5

The three judges in the Second Circuit conceeded

6

that there was no basis in fact for the board to deny Petitionex·

7

conscientious objector claim. Nevertheless, they said that

8

because he failed to exhaust his appea .. remedies wil:hin Selec-

9

tive Service, they would declide to review the classification.
We point out first that the 1967

to

Mili·;ary Selective

11

Service Act provides for review of classificaitons, "as a

12

defense to a criminal prosecution". It does not qualigy that

13

right, it does not conditioniit, on exhausing adminis~rative

14

remedies. It says rather that i"i:; can be raised, ;ceviet1 can be

ts

had after a registrant has responded to an order to report for

16

induction.

17

It's important to note, Your Honors, that the Congress

ta had before it the entire question of judicial review, it is
19

not an inadvertance that ~his aspect of judicial review is

20

stated as it is. They had it before it, they considered the

21

question of judicial review and limited only pre··induction

22

revie,-;. The question before this Court, ..i.n Oesteroich.

23

As the Senate Armed Services Committed said, "lf

24

the registrant does not submit to induction, he may raise as

25

a defense to a criminal prosecution the issue of the legality
12

1

of the cl~ssification.

2
3

4

The effect of that Act is to guarantee judicial
review in a criminal prosecution. The ~econd Circuit conceed~d
that Petitioner was unlawfully classified, implicitly it con-

5

ceeded that he was sent to jail for 2 years, or has been ord,3r-?d

6

to jail for 2 years for violating an illegaJ. order.

7

Q

The Court of Appeals theory, concession as

8

you call it, that your cli•ant had been erroneousl:r classified

9

is bas?d on the conscientious objector claim rather than en i;h,3

10

attendance at a theological school, as I w1dersta11d it.

11

A

That i.s correct. Tl",ey deal wi·~,1 that

12 claim and I will touch on it briefly, but "Che major i:::sue and
13

the is'3ue upon which Judge Feinberg relied in dissent was the

14 conscientious objector issue.
15

Q

Whnt, there is some qum,:tion, I suppose,

16 about ~hether his mere attendance at the Union Theological
17

Seminary is sufficient, is not sufficient ur.der the law,

18

not mere attendance at a theological seminary, is it?

19

A

Well, let me say briefly, Yow: Honor, th .. t

20 the Congressional mandate for ministerial de.ferrn-.ents under
21

six

G is---

22

23

Q

·----

Divinity school deferments?
That's right. Is mandatory. He hhall be

24

eferred assuming hemeets certain qualifications, ·hat's full

25

ime attendance, under the direction of a recogni::ed church.
13

1

Q

And studying to become a---

2

A

That is correct.

3

Now, McGee presented, not directly to his board, but

4

it car, be inferred from the record that the board had notice

5

of the, fact that he was a·i:tending Union Theologi,,al Seminary.

6

He die not request the deferrment, some cases ha•,e suggested

7

that it's not necessary. We point out ·the difference of the

8

language of 6-G and the language providing for student defer-

9

rrnents which requires an affirrnent of request by the registrant.

10

The language fof 6-G is "shall be deferred".

11

Q

12

you and I had agreed.

13

A

Under---

14

Q

We can --- a man who is just likes to

Not for mere attenda118e, though. I thoug':l·i:

15

dabble around philosoph:i.cally and has plenty of l:ime and

16

money so he goes to various theologicaJ: schools ~n order to

17

increase his knowledge of comparitive ~eligions, and with no

18

intent ever of becoming a minister.of the gospel, of a pasC:oral

1!)

leader, but simply wants to increase his intellectual, philo-

20

sophical and religious knowledge.

21
22
23

24
25

That man wouldn't be subject to statutory deferrment, would he?
A

Absloutely not, Your Honor.

Q

And so our record shows that that is the

purpose of this fellow, or client, excuse me, in attending, I
14

1

mean so far as the record shows we don't know whether this was

2

his purpose.

3

4

A

Well, the trial court found ·;hat he was

in full time attendance and that he was pursuing a degree lead-

s ing to study for the priesthood.
6
7

What the trial court did not find is that he was
there under the direction of a recognized church since Union

o Theological Seminary is not itself under the direction of
9
10

a

church, which is non sectariaG.
There is no evidence according to the trial judge,

11

in the record, that he was there under the direction of a re-

12

cognized church.

1.3

0

And that's a statutory requirement?

14

A

That is a statutory requirement.

15

Q

And that's the neceesary~--

,a

A

That's right. Now we do suggest ir, our

11
18

brief that Selective Service Procedures under such circumstances
authorize a board to look into the basis for a deferrment and

t9

in fact mandate that they do so, and they have ceztain pre-

20

liminary information.

21

The major point to which I would like to address my-

22 self on the emaustion question is that it is a doctrine of
23

24

25

judicial convenience to be applied flexibly that ha~ its origin in affirmative litigation, where a plaintiff comes in seek··
ing releif and there are still administrative ren,edies to be
15

t

exhausted.

2

Professor Davis tells

,,25

it i.s a doctrine concerned

3 with the timing of judicial review and tha..: it ii; not impooed
4 where it is absolutely and completely denying relief as it

s would here.
And even when used in affirmative litiga·tion there

6

7 are recognized exceptions so that it would

not bH apflied too

8 harshly. We point in our brief to Justice Frankfurters opinion

g in Republic Utilities Commission v. United Fuel case, where
10 it would in effect, impese irreparable injury on a litigant.

-tt That is a recognized exception to the exhaustion L-ule. That is
12 an exception which we urge would apply hero.
Q

13

You take the same position, I take it, if

14 he had never presented his CO claim at ail to his local draft
15

oard?

16

A

No, we would not.

17

Q

Why not?

!8

A

We make a distinction, in our brief,---

19

Q

Then why not?

20

A

Because I belie•re the act requires minimally

21

rimary jurisdiction of the local board. We urge a distinction,

22

s does Davis in his treaty between primary jurisdiction and

23

khaus~ion.

24

You are entitled to review of your clasuification, il:

25

our classification is not supported by any facts, then a court
16

1

could not properly go into anything that was not befoke the

2

local board.

3

McGee here, by concession of the Second Circuit did

4

present to tbe local board what was necessary to support his

5

classification. We don't quarrel with the fact that ht? has

6

the burden of prooving his classification.

7

We only say tha,; he met that burden.

0

Q

9

his draft board, too?

10

A

II

he did proove that---

12

Q

t3

14

15

But you do say that he had to proove to

That's correct. And we suggest here that

But he didn 't have to proove it to sorle

Appellate Court.
A

That•a right. That he is entitled in Court

to judicial review of his classification, his classification

16 was determined by the local boa~d, and was deternined here
17
18

without a basis in fact,
The effect of the application of the exhaustion rule

19

in this case, and in criminal cases generally, is to work a

20

very substantial denial of a right in a criminal prosecution.

21

The difference between the applicaiton of that rule in an

22

affirroent of a defensive case was elaborated on by Chief Judge

23

Magruder in two cases cited in our brief, the Smith and lllcCril-

24

lis cases, and there the judge said that we do not have to a

25

apply the e>:haustion rule in the defensive context, it is a
17

I

judge-made rule and we only have to, when it is mandated by

2 Congress, and the Court there dealt with the tlfe major pre3 cedents in this Court upon which exhaustion has been premised,
4

namely Yakus and Myers vs. Bethlehem Shipbuilding.

5

And the Court there said those were specifically

6 cases in which Congress had mandated the exhaustion prior to
7 judicial review. Here, as we said before, there was no mandate
0 Congressional mandate to that effect and in fact, the Congres9 sional mandate is tb the contrary, that it autho~ized judicial

10 review.
11

That brings us to McKart. !-lcKart, we subnit, reflectn

12 that general suspicion of the exhaustion remedy. It draws the
13

14

istiactions between affirmative and defensive context. It pointi,
ut that in the defensive context it is an exceedingly harsh
octrine and should be imposed there only where it

16

17
18
19

20

21
22

clearly

ut:rays the inC.erests of the registrant in having a right to
ssert a defense to a criminal prosecution.
The major interest to be served here is whether o~
other registrants are going to be read by the relaxation of
e exhaustion rule in this case, to forego their administrative
emedics and come into court and defend a criminal prosecution.
The McKart court suggests that maybe there is a dif-

23

erence between the legal issue presented there ar.cl the CO clal m

24

he co claim, we submit, is a legal issue, you take, as the

25

ourt does, any basis in fact case before it, an indisputed s~i.
18

I

of facts and apply them to a legal standard. It i.s the same

2

issue which confromts this Court whether or not there is exhau;-

3

tion. There is no different burdan.

4

The question then, is are other registrants going to

5

do what 11cGee did? Rec0911izing, as we must, that what McGee did,

6

he did for, out of reasons of moral scruples.

7

But will other registrants do it for tactical rea-

0 sons? And the governments response to this is crucial and I
9

think deserves special attention. The government says, "If we

tO

let HcGee decline to appear before his local board, as he did

11

And the Form 150 is the Conscientious Ob··

A

It is, Your Honor. At that point he will

e classified presumably I-A by his board, told that he has

20

right to a personal appearance, not that he must personally

21

ppear. ltcGee was not told he must personally appear, only tha,:

22

e had a right to appear. Refuse to appear, told that he has

23

right to appeal, and refuse to appeal. lie will then refuse

nduction and have perfect defense before the Court. There will

25

e no basis in fact upon which a Court could uphold the I-A

of a I-A classification if the man had not supmittad anything

A

I submit that there would be. We subn1it in

our brief that there would be substantial basis in fact for
denying his claim, and if the Eorrn 150 was considered by the
boarc. to be inaaequate, it left them in doubt, we have a pretty
well stated claim here but we want to see him to test his sin20

your claim.

11

13

doubts, as I suggest, he can be called in.

Q

Aie

you suggesting that the b:>ard has an

ta

obligation to call him in, before they rule. if he has submittad

15

all the mat.erial that he wishes to submt!:.?

17

A

No. We suggest that under currant Selectiva

18

Service procedures, the board has put itself, and the sy.stem has

t!l

put itself in the position of classifying without a personal

20

appearanca. The sequence :'.s tha~ you st.bmit your claim, you ara

21

classified, then you have your right to personal appearance.

22

Now if that'a the way the se:ective Service system

.23

.24
25

wants to classify, they can. And when you submit your lforrn 150,
if it• s a good claim, they' re obliged t.o gi•,e you your. classification. If it is an inadequate claim, then either you have not
21

1

met your burden of prooving your entitlement to the claim, and

2

the board then is obliged to state its reasons why H:, you have

3

not met your claim.

4

Or if the board then is left in doubt, then since

5

the registrant has made out his primae facaie case, it is up

to the board then to find some affirmative evidence

15

A

I'm sorry, Your Honor, that :·;s the major

16

response to which the government advances to our suggestion

t7

that registrants will not look at this courts decision in McGee,

18

assuming its favorable to McGee and say, "Hey, there's a good

10

out for us, we'll simply fail to appear, fail to exhaust, and

20

defenc. in a criminal prosecution."

21
22
23

24
25

we submit that the best way still to get a cI'assification is to go through the Selective Service System, and that
the or.ly people who don't, and if one looks throught the exhaustion cases, the only ones who don' I: are the very rare
peopl~ like McGee, and there seems to have been in ~eported

MR. LEVINE: I will try to be as brief as

to

Mr. Justice White asked prior to the luncheon break

11

hat was the statut:ory- requirement for the claim initially

12

o be presented to the local board. I quote from sectmon 10 (b)

(3)

of the Act; which says that, "A local board shall hear and

t4

etermine all questions or claims with respect to inclusion for

15

r exeffiption of defernnent from training and service under this

I think pursuant to that requir ement that the regis-

The major del:errant to any other registrant---

21

Q

22

Where is the statute that says that a

ourt trying a criminal case is disentitled ~o consider wheth3r
man is a conscientious objector or not?

24
25

A

The statute only says, says that the Court

hall obly review a basis in fact, and preswnably that is the
24

1

limitation on this Courts review, or on any courts review, that

2

they cannot consider the whole claim on its merits, but only

3

on whether there is a basis in fact for denial.

4

5
6

Q

You imply, that it can only i:eview a board

determination?
A

That's right, Your Honor. The major det-

7

errent, though, for another registrant to do what McGee did

0

here, is the simple fact \:hat i= he wants his classification,

9

the best place to do it is before the Selective Service Syste~.

10

He only has to convince the Oelective Servicy System

11

on the merits that he's entitled to the classification, wher3-

12

as a court, in review would only be determining whether ornot

t.3

there is a basis in fact ior denial of that claim.

!4

We cite a long line of cases in thls Court, Greene

15

v. z.tcElroy, Ken~ v. Dulles, which suggest that a substantial

16

right, here the right to defend yourself in a criminal pre-

I think the standard for McGees claim, the one used

ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT.
MR. REYNOLDS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

20

21

22

it please the Court.
I think that the cases Falbo and Estep read together,

23

clearly establish that the principle of exhaustion of adininis-

24

trative remedies does have a place in criminal actions brought

25

under the Selective Service laws,
26

1

And that general concept was not under attack in the

2

recent McKart and (OeVernay) cases. They involved, instead,

3

exceptional circumstances, said to warrant a relaxation of the

4

doctrine, on the particular facts presented.

5

Here, however, Petitioner seeks to have this Court

6

overrule Falbo, Estep, and their progeny, primarily because

7

as I under stand the argument, he comes before the Courts, not

0

as a Plaintiff seeking affirmative relief, but as a Defendant

9

chargec with a crimi.i:ial offense.

10

At the outse\;, it seems that if a11 applicaiton of the

ti

exhaustion doctrine were to turn on such a distinction, the

12

effect would be in essence to penalize the registrant who after

13

failing to exercise his administrative remedies, decides to

14

obey the law and submit to induction, seeking affirmative re-

t5

leif in the coutts through a habeas corpus action.

16

He would, under Petitii:mers theory, be precluded by

17

the exhaustion doctrine from challenging his classification.

18

On the other hand, if this same registrant had decided to

19

violate the law, and had then been criminally prosecuted, Pe-

20

titioner maintains that he cannot similarly be barred from rais-

21

ing the same claim as a defense.

22

23

Q

You mean, by violate the law, you mean

refuse to submit to induction?

24

A

Yes, Your HOnor.

25

Q

Of course, his claim is that he's not vio27

1

lating the law, beacuse he's entitled to a consc~en~ious ob-

2

jectciu:·---

3
4

A

That's correct, Your Honor. If a criminal

5

We do not think the el<haustion doctrine was ever i:1-

6

tended to be applied in the manner which would encourage re-

7

gistrants to refuse induction and discourage them frorJ com-

e

plying with the law and testing their classification ~n habeas

9

corpus procedings.

10

Moreover, to insist that the ei<llaustion doctrine can-

tt

not be inpoked under any circumstances in criminal prosecutions

12

under the Selective Service laws, is to ignore the statutory

13

scheme on which this Court has baaed its earlier decisions in

14

this area.

15

Congress and the President carefully constructed a

t6

very comprehensive and fair administrative appeal process within

17

the Sele~tive Service System. At the time the local board clas-

18

sifies a registrant, it is t:equired to notify him he has 30

19

days within which to request a personal appearance before his

20

local board or to takt ~he appeal to the state Appeal Board.

21

And that there is a government appeal agent avail-

22

able to advise him fully of his appeal rights and assist him in

23

any appeal process. At a personal appearahce, the registrant

24

may discuss his classification, with the local board members

25

and present both orally and in writing any new information
28

1

he believes ma.y be relevant to his claim.

2
3

And a written record of the appearance is placed in
his Selective Service file.
On appeal to the State Appeal Board, the registrant

4
5

may specify in writing the m:i·tters in which he believes the

6

local board erred or which he believes it failed to consider.
The State AppeaJ. Boards consideration is de novo. Th~

7
8

Based on its independent review of the registrants Selective

9

Service files. Its classification is one of first instance.

10

Not a mere affirmance or reversal of the local bo::1.rd.
More.over, if the information in the registrants Se-

11
12

lective Service file is not sufficient to enable the Appeal

13

Board to de~ermine the proper c:assification, the Appeal Board

14

is required by the regulations to return the file to the

15

local board Tor additional infoL-rnationoor action,

behalf and a question of some importance appears to be involved.
No registrant can be ordered to report for inducti on

Now while a registrant is nowhere required in the

10

reflects clearly that the intent wa, to commit the resolution

1t

of such questions in the first instance to the diseretion and

12

expertise of anlocal and Appeal Boards.

13

And this intent, it seems to us, was underscored in

14

this Courts recent decisions in Oes·tere.ic:h

ta

and Clark v.

And it seemed to be simple to the unanimous decision

19

of theCourt only last term in Mulloy. Of course, as stated in

20

the McKart case, the exhaustion doctrine must be tailored to

21

fit the peculiarities of the administrative syste~ which Congr€sf

22

and the President have created.

23

And thus, where, as In McKarf, classification is not

24 one rec;uiring administrative discretion and expertise, but

25

turns insteati on the sta~utory inte~pretatmon . There is gener30

t
2

ally good reason to exhaust the exhaustion princi?le, to require further resot:t to local and .l\ppeal Boards, which are

3

concedly ill suited to the task of coping with su,::h pure

4

questions of law which serve no real purpose.

5

Similiarly, if the local boards action is challenged

6

on strict Constitutional grounds as was the situation in the

7

Wolff case in the Second Circuit, that exhaustior.. of admin-

0

istrative remedies might not be necessary.

9

.In ·that case, the Second Circuit declined to invole

10

the do-::trine to prec!.ude judicial review of delinquincy re-

H

classL:ications, assigned to registrants for sitti.ug in at

12

eheir draft boards.

13

And ther reason given was that the action by the

14

local board raised significant First Ai"llentment questions under

15

this Courts decision in Dumbrowski. Now would it seem is the

t6

doct:rine so wooden as to require its application where a fegis·

17

trant can shciw he was physically unable to exhaust.

18

Or he could show some other special or unusmsl cir-

19

cumstances which justify his failure to exhaust. And I think

20

in thif connection its instructed to po;i.nt out that the case,

21

McNeil v. United States a conscientious objector cose, which

22

was ren anded to the District Court after. t'lcKart for further

23

consideration in.light of this Courts decision in McKart.

24

In that case, Juage (Merrick) of the Eastern District

25 of Vir9inia relaxed the exhaustion principle on the ground that
31

1

there were, in that case, special circumstances, in his words,

2

that j_f, that the registrant apparently l"'cked any comprehensior

3

of hiz administrative rights, under the administrative appeal

4

procec.ure.

5

However, we do not consider the instant case to be

6

within any of these exceptions. At the outset, Petitioners

7

efforts to bring the case within the Mcl{art rationale on the

8

grounc that the local board failed to consider his conscien-

9

tious objector claim is simplynnot supported by this record.

10

Wh~le there is some ambiguity in the board chairmans

11

testimony as to whether the claim was, in l•larc:h, 1966, at the

12

time that Petitioner held a student deferment, whether it was

t3

considered at that time, ther record clearly established that

14 Petitioners entire file was reviewed and considered by the
15
16

17
18

full board prior to re-classification in September, 1967.
That is when he got his I-A classification from the
II-S classificaiton.
And the District !:ourt found as a fact that the claim

19 had been fully considered as did the majority below. But l

20
21

22
23

24

25

think that the essential point here is that even had the local
board failed to consider the claim in the circumstances of
this case, McKart wouldnnot be controlling.
It is undisputed tbat the local boarda action in
September, 1967, was not in response to the letter Petitioner
rote to the President on April 15, 1967. That is, we do not hav

32

1
2

here an instance of unlawful re-classification by the local
board in the Oestereich and Greene sense.

3

At r.1ost, we have a situation where the board, in l•1arch

4

1966 did not actually consider the claim because Petitioner at

5

that time held a lower II-S elaasification. And ':hen in Sep-

6

tember, 1967, the board, mistakenly believing it had earlier

7

consicered a claim, and finding no new information in the file

8

relating to the claim, based its denia~ on what it thought to

9

be a frior determination on the merits .

tO

It is our view that that is precisely the type of

tt

proce<iural error, had that in fact been the case, which Congress

12

and the President anticipated at the time they constructed the

13

elaborate appeal machinery within the system.
Plainly, a personal appl!!arance would have corrected

t4

15

such a mistake. An appeal to the State Appeal Board, which was

iG

required to consider

17

have cured the mistake.

Petitioners file de novo, uould certainly

Nothing here suggests that such a course would have

J8

19

been a futile exercise. Unlike McKart, the admin~.strative

20

determination of Petitioner6

21

was not a matter solely of statutory interpretat~on.

conscientious objector claim

'l'here was no statement here by the Stata Director

22
23

as there was in 11cKart that hveuas predisposed to deny Petition-

24

ers claim. Moreover, we are not here dealing with a classificat:

25

tion question, where this Court can determine with any cerC

33

1

taint)' that! they could in McKart that Petitioner is entitlled

2

to an exemption as a matter

3

of

law.

Here the claim is to conscientia& objector status.

4

Such« claim by its very nature calls for the type of factual

5

deterr,inations which Congress has said shouid, in the first

6

instar·ce be left to the discretion and special expertise of

7

local and appeal boards.
Moreover, it is one of the few claims that does not

8
9

turn Exclusively cbn the registrants written submissions. It is

to

undiS(:Uted that Petitioner made out a primae fac:tae case for

t1

exemption in his special consclentious objector form.
But as this Court recognized in the Whitmer case,

12
13

and again in (Seeger) there is also the substantial question

14

of Petitioners sincerety.
Here the local board, which did consider the claim

15

16

may have thought that the Petitioner was insincere, perhaps

17

because he claimed to have always been a religious conscientious

18

objector, and yet in August, 1964, at at time when he held a

19

I-A classification, he expressed some willingness to submit to

20

induction.
Or perhaps because his letter to the President

21

was

22

read

23

governments policies in Viet Ham. And the board night have

24

felt that this was the real basis for his claim. Whatever the

25

by

the local board as reflecting an objection to the

basis for the local boards denial in this case, we think it is
34

1

clear that the administrative system never had an 9pportunity

2

to exa:nine the sincerity of Petitioners professed beliefs.

3

Perhaps, as Petitioner suggests, if the local board

4

doubted his sinr::erety the better approach would have been to

5

call him in for an interview pr5.or to re-classification. But

6

the la·,,. does not require local boards

7

1;0

do this.

Moreover, in view of. Petitioners letter to the

8

President and his subsequent statemen~ to the local board

9

that he would ~sturn all corresponoence from the system un-

0

opened, both of which took place prior to the tine that the

11

local board considered his claim in September, 1957, it seems

12

to us unlikely that the Petitioner would have app~ared even if

13

the local. boa:c'd had made such a request.

t4

15

tG
17

Q

Did he sendtto the local boaJ:d a copy of

lie did not sen<i himself a copy but it was

~outed to the local board.

Q

Was the notice to repor·; for the physical

examination a postcard or a sealed letter?
A

I believe that that was a sealed letter.

35

I believe that the Selective Service System sends
2

all their orders in sealed enveloP.es with their stamp en the

3

corner and a window.

4

The essential point, Your Honor, is that the Salect~.ve

5

Service laws place the burden on the registrant to proove his

6

sin\;'.erety. Had Petitioner requested a personal interview per-

7

haps he could have laid to rest any doubts that the local

8

board might have had in this regard.

20

25

Had he taken an appeal to the State Appeal Board,
perhapr it would have read Petitioners file differently than t~e
local board and granted the exemption. Or it might have found
the information in the file insufficient and sent it back to
the local board with the instructions to call Petitioner for
an int~rview.
What we are saying is if the local board did in fact
commit error in the classification of Petitioner, it was
precisely the type of error within the competence of the
administrative agency to correct. But Petitioner has chusen
deliberately to bypass the administrative appeal mach1.nery.
Whate~erhis reasons he has willfully adopted a position of
total non-cooperation with the systel'II, a choice he made prior
to the time that the board gave final consideration to his
claim on the merits.
Thus there has been no opportunity for the local
.and appeal board to consider fully the sincerity of his profeose ·

36

1

beliefs.
If the exhaustion of administrative rem~dies

boards well drafted conscientious objector claims, followed
shortly by a letter advising the board that their opposition in
so strong that they no longer can cooperate with the system.

posturg as the instant case, without anyone having an opportunity to pass directly on the sincerety of their professed
beliefs.
Since the Courts are not permitted under this Courts
ruling in (Gibson) to re~ieve additonal evidence on this question, it seems to us that they would heve no cho~ca following
the Estep standard which is nQW in statute but to dismiss a
criminal prosecution for refusal to submit on the ground that

What bearing do you think the Divinity clai.m

has on this exhaustion problem, or its. nQ.t a claiu,_ bec!'!.u!5e I

17

guess he never file l one, did he?

18

A

That's---

19

Q

But its something on which the board was

20
21

aware ,'lt the time.
A

Well, Your Honor, in our view the board

22 ...as no.; on constructive notice of the clain1. I thi.nk our prin23

24

25

ciple response is that flith respect to the Divinity claim,
Petiti.oner not onl.y failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, he did not even invoke them in the first place. And
38

I

courtf do not have under the statute plenary review of class-

2

ification t;iuestions, but are explicitJy limited to determining

3

whether the action of the administrative agency is without

4

any basis in fact .
But even if we assume that the board had constructive

5
6

not.ice, and even if we assume .that the facts that Petj. tioner

7

relied on at t~ial, because the District Court did accept evi-

8

dence on this point, even--Q

9

Judge Friendly dealt wit.hit, in his

10

footr.ot:e, but Judge Feinberg said nothing about tt, as I

t1

recall.

12

A

Except that Judge Feingerg did state, Your

1.3

Honor, that hls position would be entirely different even wi·;h

14

respet:t to the conscientious objector claim if there had been

iS

no ten:iering of a claim in the first instance tot.he local

t6

board.

17

And I would also add that even on the facts presented,

18

this Pat.it.ioner was not enti~led to such an exemption. That's

19

a fact..ial quest.ion. The Courts looked at that and there was no

20

showing that he met the statutory standard that his studjes,

21

that h? himself as stiudent. studies were under the direct.ion of

22

a recognized church or theological institution.

23
24

25

He was attending Union Theological Seminary, but
there is no evidence that he·was there under the direction of
a church or religlous organization.

he now has one or not, I don't know.

if you l~se this one, aren't you?

that as to the other- counts the Petitioner was properly ccnvic-~e

I believe if we lose on the fitst issue ,

you could properly remand to the Court of Appeals to pass on--Q

You don't urge that we make an independent

examination of any of those other issues?

I don't think that this Court needs to do

A

12

That is our pooition in our brief, Your

13

Honor, and lbelieve that that is correct. But at the same

14

Q

'.[hat's what I---

A

No, Your Hoaor , that's not what we are

19

5

20

urgin~. But the other counts are briefed and before the Court.

21
22
23

24

25

I think that the conviction on those points was proper. 'l'he failure to report to his preinduction physical examination, Petitioner justified that on the fact t'1at because he
was classified 1-A imporperly he was under no obligation to
obey the intermediate directives of the local boa.rd.
42

1

Now I don't beleive that this argument can be sus-

2

tained.the pre.induction physical examination .i.s for the purpose

3

of ass.u-ing the local board that a registrant is physically

4

qualified and available for indJction, prior to the time that

5

it iss~es its induction order in order to fill its call.

6

The induction which Petitioner underwent at the

7

station is a much more, much: shorter exam:Lnation and it is

8

merely to determine the changes in his physical s-:atu::: from l.:he

9

time of his earlier preinduction physical.

10

And therefore it's our view that that does rot

11

absolv3 his failure to report to the Sele~t.ve Se::·.rice pre-

12

induction physical.

13

He argues that his notice of classifica~ion was in-

14

valid because his assigned alassification was invalid. In our

15

view the qualifier "valid" in the regulation related, does not

16

relate to anything other than the certificate itself. And that

'17 · it be ,3uthentic and properly executed. Now Petitioner does
f8

not contest the fact that his notice of classification met

!9

these requirements.

20

And finally, on the information questionairre, the

21

categorical language of the regulation viol~ted provides that

22

each regisuant shall submit to his local board, in writing,

23

24

25

all information which the local board may at any time request
from him, Petitioner conceds that his failure to respond to
the current information questionairre undoubtedly violated

113

t
2

this language.
We believe there is no good excuse, no good reason

3

to excuse the violation. We are not dealing here 11ith a minor

4

lapse, but with a flat defiance of a reasonable request·£or

5

information, not readily available to the local board otherwi.se,

6

and which Petitioner never provided to them.
