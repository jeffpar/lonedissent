ARGUMENT OF PHILIP J. SHE.1, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. SHEA: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice and may it

8

please the Court.

9

The issue raised by this appeal is whether the three

10

judge District Court sitting in Phoenix, Arizona, by its

n

12 ' decree of May 19, 1970, abused its discretion and committed

13

error by refusing to issue a preliminary injunction to and

14

enjoin the operation -— admittedly unconstitutional reappor­

15

tion plains.

%

Now the reapportionment plan was before the Court,

16

had been enacted by a special session of the state legislature,

17

and signed into lav; on January 22, 1970.

18

As in all prior apportionment statutes before it,

19
20

it —— the idea that reapportionrraant should be brought about

21

on the basis of voter registration. And not on thebasis of

22

people.

23

Now the use of voter registration distinguished from

.

24
25

the use of population of people in Arizona has particularly
invidious discriminatory effects. It probably would in anyplace,
A

1

becuase of poor people and certain minorities don’t register

2

as much as other people, as much as the affluent.

3

It is particularly so in Arizona, The northeastern

4

part

5

large state, contains the highest concentration of Indians

6

of any area in the United States.

7
3

of the State of Arizona which is one sixth of a very

There are about 70,000 .American Indians, Navajos and
Hcpis and some Apaches. The average sized district, legislative
district in Arizona is 54,000 people. The 70,000 Indians in

10

northeastern Arizona are still, under this reapportioranent plan

11

dominated by their white neighbors to the South.

12

In South Phoenix, which is a very poor area, that is

13

mostly poor black, poor Mexican-American, poor white, and the

14

legislative district in South Phoenix, and there

15

there are several thousand people in an area in Northeastern

16

Phoenix, an area which is all white, an area which is affluent,

17

there are 27 thousand people. More than twice as many people

18

are in south Phoenix in a district as in northeastern Phoenix.

•«a

1

is just one,

Now this discrimination of course is invidious, of

20

course is horrible, and so we complain that the Court committed

21

error, clearly abused its discretion, by refusing to enjoin

22

it. Voter registration as the basis of apportionment

23

zona has a long history, as a matter of fact, it's the only

24

way we*ye ever apportioned a legislature.

25

in Ari­

At least the lower House. Beginning with the adoption

5

1

of the Arizona Constitution in 1913, which was the basis of

2

which was the original statement of theapportionment arrange-

3

menfc »

4

The lower House, the House of Representatives is

5

apportioned on the basis of voter registration. The upper

6

House, the State Senate, was then apportioned on tbe basisof

7

county

8
9

representation. Two members from each county.
Now this suit was filed by Gary Peter Klahr, then

a third-year law student in April of 1964. The law at that

10

time seemed quite clear. This Court had seen to make a simple

a

flat and direct statement that there should be one man one vote.

12

Nevertheless, the Court did not act on the complaint,

13

did not hold hearings on it until more than a year and a half

14

later. It was waiting patiently for the legislation to do the

15

job, for the reason that I'm sure the Attorney: General is going

16

to say here, today, that the legislature should be given an

17

opportunity to remedy the wrong.

18

The legislature, for

more than a year after the

19

suit was filed enacted something called Senate Bill 11, which

20

provided for a terribly apportioned State SFhate and didn't

21

deel whatever with the terribly malapportioned House of

22

Representatives.

23

After a hearing on that Bill, the Court by its de­

24

cree, and it was the first decree issued in this case, the de­

25

cree of February 22, 1966, held that the constitutional arrange6

1

ment of both houses was unconstitutional,» that is, the Ari­

2

zona Constitutional arrangement was unconstitutional under the

3

U. S. 14 fch Amendment.

4

And also that Senate Bill 11, was unconstitutional

S

and

6

called a "temporary plan" a temporary provisional plan»

7

went on to impose a court plan,, what it, in its decree

That was based on voter registration» At least, it

8

was based on voter registration in the urbafa areas of Phoenix

9

and Tucson. And outside of the Counties including Phoenix

10

and Tucson, the rural counties, apportionment was based on 1966

21

county census following, or respecting county lines.

22

Now the malapportionment resulting from the use of

13

this system, that is to say, voter registration in the cities,

24

and the respecting county lines in the rural areas was gross.

15

There

were deviations from plus 16 percent to

26

minus 6 percent. And that"s just in the county areas. There is

27

now way of computing how much more gross malapportionment was

28

under that plan in the urban areas where registration was --

19

.

Nonetheless, this temporary provisional plan, so-call

20

called was used

21

still had failed to act in a valid way. The legislature did

22

try its hand again In 1967 and it was declared uncondtitutional.

23

And then it came back in 1969.

24
25

in 1966 and again in 1968. The legislature

Now the arguments, the principle argument on the
RE spondent is not that the plan that5 s in effect, the new
7

?

temporary provisional plan, not that it0s gonstitutional.
It's grossly malapportioned. It's a gross case of

2
3

malapportionment. The argument ihere is that well, the Court

4

ordered this plan be used in the elections of November,

5

and therefore it looses its sting after that.

970,

On the reason that we came here to complain was,

6
7

that history does not show that the malapportionment plan

8

looses its sting the day after the election, and that it goes

9

away.
The decree of February 22,

10

n
12

3
4
5

was used not only in . 966, but in

back and waiting for the legislature to act, whffibh is very
nice. And they should give them a reasonable chance, but 7
years is far too long.

Incidentally, is the legislature the

Well didn't the Court say here that if the

that—

1

A

Yes.

Q

That the Court would act?

3

A

Yes.

Q

What does thatmean? You don't think

that means anything, is that it?
A

It means that they'll open the doors to

Either the Court or the

going to reapportion the state.

There has to be a new plan?

Q

This Court?

A

No. By the three juc|ge court sitting

in Phoenix.

17

Q

It said it's going to do that if the

18

legislature doesn't act by November 1st, of this year, on

19

the basis of the 1970 census figures.

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

What it said, I believe, was that if the

legislature fails to act validly by November 1, 1971, any party
may petition for fxirther relief. And that's not to say, I don't
believe that if the Court is going to impose itself the
constitutional plan--Q

Has sit stuck to the plan yet? Have your

No» But if they

open the door to us we'll

have one in a jiffy. Of course. We had one last year, i n

figures.

9

A

No, we haven^t.

Q

And if you did, would you go to the

Court and say here’s a plan based on tehe 1970 figures, give

us a hearing on it, what would, happen?

We take if from the opinion of the Court

we take the Court at its word, that it

Well the state didn't prosecute here, did

A

No.

25

Q

So that it is apparently satisfied with the

it?

11

1

way the DistrietCCourt decided things on the substantive issue.

2

3

A

Yes. I take it, *lr. Justice White, that

they agree-—

4

Q

Well the legislature followed that decision

5

isn't about to apportion based on registration figuees, for

6

example.

7

A

Well, the legislature had again history

8

gives us no basis for being sanguine about what the legis-

9

alature is going to do.

10

Q

But here you have an outstanding judgement

11

that says that, opinion says that voter registration figures

12

aren't an accurate basis for

A

Well, we had, Baker against Carr, we

even had Wells and Rockefeller and all the rest. We know what

the truth is, we know what the law is, we've always known it.

Yet the legislature, time and time again,

17

stubborn refusal to follow the law.

Well, I suppose if they

exhibits the

do,

well you can

19

attack that plan. But right now there's no issue between you

20

and the state on voter registration.

21

22
23
24
25

A

No, there is no issue as to v/hat should

be done. We all know what the law is.
Q

Good. And no issue on any of these sub­

stantive issues.
A

That'S right. What you call substantive,
12

1

yes. The question

2

Q

is—
I gather really the only issue you're

3

presenting to us is that the Court has v/aited long enough

4

for the legislature to act, it won't do it, and the

5

has got to cact and you want vis to tell the Court you fashion

6

a plan, now, and make it effective. That's what you want

7

us to do,

8
9
10

A

I wish I could have

Court

said it as well.

That is exactly what I want, yes sir,
Q

You press that notwithstanding the

11

Courts explicit statement that it will act on November 1st

12

if the legislature has not acted?

13

A

Again, Mr, Chief Justice, the -Court said

14

that we may then petition, btufout the reason that we * re

15

upset is that the Coufct had in April of 1070 had all the ©pop­

16

ulation figures, had the best population figures around, had

17

a plan before it. We could have had population in the 1970

18

elections, we could have had a fair plan in 1970, and we're

19

not so confident now.

20

First of all we're very doubtful that a malapportion­

21

ment legislature is going to reapportion itself so that its

22

very leadership is decimated. We can't really expect that.

23

It hasn't happened in the past and we can't expect it again.

24

And we can't expect the Court, we're not terribly optimistic

25

about the Court fashioning prompt relief when we come to our
13
■ .* *

1

hearing in 1972 after filing our petition on November 1 and

2

November 2, we can!t be so optimistic that the Court would

3

than presented with another population plan that isn't going

4

to do anything different than it did in April <&£ 1970.

5

Q

Your position is that you9 re unhappy with

6

the legislature and you're unhappy with the three judge court.

1

And you want us to do it.

8
9

A

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't want

you to reapportion the State, I want

you to tell the Court

10

below to hear us right away on the population plan. And to

n

order it ——
Q

12

13

Now we're down to whether you get a hear­

ing before the Court next week or in November.

14

A

Exactly.

Is that where

be soon enough?

Well, first of all. There is a double

edged question. First of all, there is the time and secondly,

9

there is the fact

10

impose a plan.

13

right away, and when you open the doors, if a constitutional
plan is submitted to you, based on population, impose it.
Now if no one can do it, tell them to run at large,

14
15

and everyone will do it. Everyone will get together then.
Nobody wants that.

16
17

So what we'd like is for this Court to open the doors

that the Court has not said that it would

Q

Yes.

A

Well—

Q

How long have youbeen waiting?

A

Well the complaint

15

was filed in April of

1

1964.

2

Q

1964?

3

A

Yes, so it's a 7 year

case

now* It's again

4

one of the reasons why we're not terribly optimistic .about

S

what8s going to happen in the next few months, because we don't

6

feel the people have shown the will to go ahead and to do

7

what they're just reluctant to do*

8

Q

You mean the Courts?

9

A

The Courts and the legislature»

The
i

10

Courts have been too indulgent, and too patient, we heleive,

i?

with the legislature, we have no reason to think that the

12

legislature is going to all of a sudden have some inner

13

resurection and get religion. It hasn't in the pase, and

U

the legislature is still as malapportioned as ever. And

15

seems amazing since I've been in this the sense of territory

t6

that the. legislators have.

it

17

You know, it's like animals. They develop a sense

13

of territory and the territory is the area from which thery

19

were elected.

20

And they'll go kicking and screaming before they

21

change it. And that is particularly true when you have a leg­

22

islature that we now ha%^e, with a control by the majority

23

party, from these people that are from northeast Phoenix or

24

that you know, they have 27,-00 people

25

reapportioning half of them have to go. Or a good number of them

16

and when they start

i

have to go, I can't really quite see the legislature, it's

2

been my experience

in the past, they donBt likd to do that»

So we have no optimism whatever that the legis­

3
4

lature is going tc

5

have any optimism that the Court is going to say well do it

6

or run at large, or bring us a plan so that we can do some-

7

thing, and we'll order it in effect»
So for this reason we're seeking the order of this

8
9
10

do the right thing, and we don't

Count to order the three judge court to open its doors to

'before then.

Well you say the Court has been waiting

7 years and it doesn't look like it's ever going to move, what
7

1

makes you think it’s going to move quick now? What you really

2

want us to do is lay down guidelines and tell the coutt how

3

to haidle its business.

4

A

Well the Court--—

5

Q

Right? Right?

6

A

To an extent. The term guidelines, Mr.

1

Justice Marshall can be used — because you see the District

8

Court by its decree of May 19, 1970, filed an opinion inthe

9

thing which set guidelines, which are very enlightened.

10
11
12

13

It

set them :for the legislature.
;: But it refused to make any specific orders to what
would happen. As to what should happen.
Q

As I understand it really, what you want
.t

14

it to have the Court change its platitude into an order.

15

A

Exactly, Mr. Justice Black.

16

Q

Mr. Shea, if the

Court adopted a plan

17

now based on the 1970 census "~r

18

heard you and the Court adopted your plan, and put it into

19

effect, and then the legislature had a special session and

20

adopted its own plan, I suppose it would supercede the District

£1

22
23
24
25

figuras, if the Court

Courts plan.
A

Yes, I think that—

Q

What have your really gained? You wouldn't

think the legislature would not attempt its own plan?
A

If the Court made one, andthen the legis-

18

1

lature could only get its plan approved if it enacted one just

2

as good or better, and it would do so,

3

Q

I know, but there might be all sorts of

4

choices that could be made about how to construct a eensfci"

5

tutional plan.1;

G

A

I think that Mr* Justice White, really,

7

on the basis of experience, again, that these nice decisions

8

are going to be made by the legislature when the next legis­

9

lature, right after a legislature iselected on

10

the basis; of

a properly apportioned plan.

11

But you're not going to

have a nice constitutional

12

plan come out of a terribly malapportioned legislature. I

13

don't think it's going to be until after the election of

ARGUMENT OP JOHN M. McGOWAN, II, ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

20
21

Thank you, Mr. Shea. Mr. McGowan?

MR. McGOWAN: Mr. Chief Justice andmmay it please
the Court.

22

I would like to briefly review for the Court some

23

of the history of this case. As Mr. Sheaproperly stated, it

24

was filed in April 1964.

25

lature becasue at that time, the legislature was in ajournment.

Mo action was teken intthe legis­

19

1

They did not meet again until 65« And at thattime

2

they made some passing attempts at legislation,, Then in

3

a special session in October of 65 it passed, one house passed

4

a bill, the Senate passed a Bill, That was than before the

5

Court in the hearings that w® had in November of 1965 and

6

lest there be a feeling that the present majority was the maj­

7

ority then, the Senate was elected lin 1964 by two Republicans

3

and 26 Democrats.

9

They had 35 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the

10

House. That was in the old Senate, before reapportionment.

II

In 1965 we held a three day hearing before then Circuit Judge

12

Court, the Judge Walsh, and -- - . And in February of 1966

13

the decree was issued.
And the parties were told to agrree on the two

14
15

populace counties for the division, the -- county, and the

16

agreement was in effect reached, and the Court changed a few

17

precincts, and the agreement was reached between, in effect,

18

the

19

between Mr.

20

Democratic governor and the legislature.

21

parties, I mean the political parties. At that time ——
(Klower) and the governor was at that time the

The decree established the fact that we had a —-

22

districts in the state, and eabh senatorial district had 2

23

house members„ In the, and the counties were kept together as

24

units except in the 2 major counties, and there they were sub­

25

divided by a form that the Court approved. That the Court in

20

1

effect suggested and it was bringing the I960 census figures

2

up to date by a ratio

3

to the precinct involved. Because in : Arizona rapid growth

4

patterns, if we used census tracts, which if you go to read

5

the census tracts, they say up to a telephone pole, in effect,

6

over a creek, and down to ah old mining camp..

7

8

of the voter registration in the county

There is no description in the sense that we use
in any other legal works, in dividing census tracts.

9

So we used precincts in the 1966 version. In the

10

election of 1966, in the Senate, there were 16 Republicans

11

elected, and .14 democrats, 33 Republicans in the House, and 27

12

Democrats. For the first time in history the Republican party

13

had a majority in either house, or both houses.

14

So I say that to you for

j
j

ifchis one reason. That the

15

present, leadership of the House and Senate are the beneficiaries

16

of reapportionmsnt. If it was not for reapportionmenf they

17

would still be in

18

.the minority.

And not only do they act in good faith in an attempt

19

to reapportion, it is to their own enlightened self-interest.

2.0

Because they would not be there without reapportionment. In

21

1967 there was a special session in which another attempt was

22

made to have a legislative enacted reapportionment to replace

23

the Court decree. That special session was in the spring, in

24

May of

25

1967.
At that time, the

21

matter was referred to the people.

1

OUr constitution says that 5 parcent of the voters may refer

2

to the people anybbill. No bill becomes a law for 90 days..

3

So prior to its effective date, this was referred

4

to the people by 5 percent of the elected. It was moved to

5

the ballot in 1968, The people approved it in 1968,, and we

6

hadda hearing in January of 1969 in which the Court struck

7

down house bill when it was called because it did not follow

8

it -- registration figures only, because in the mean time,

9

Kirkparfciek and the Rockefeller? case had come up.
At the time of the first decree in 196S, tiie

10

i

1!

Court was laboring under the thought, as Mr, Frank reminded

12

them in our hearing last spring, of the so-called Cellar

13

amendment, which was then pending in the Congress, that we

14

could have a

IS

this courts decision in Kirkpartick of course is no longer

16

the case.

17

15 percent variation in figures. That followed

The, in 19, in the hearing we had last April, on the

18

present plan in which they were elected, the --- witness, Mr.

19

(Krogenfeld) who had testified beforethe ad hoc House and Sen-

20

ate Committee testified that the census tracts would not be

21

available until August of 1971. That is on page 168 of the
transcript.

That's correct,

Is that right?

That's correct, Your Honor.

Do you think that the legislature is under

Yes, sir»

By November 1, sir»

Where do you find that?

In the decree of the Court-—

21

A

Well, we think it is, Your Honor»

22

Q

It says that failure of the legislature to

23

do so any party may apply to the Courto That just leaves

24

it open for the continuation, does it not?

25

A

Well, sir* it's the states position is that

23

1

we have a deadline and we will so instruct the legislature,

2

that they have a deadline of having a bill ready for us to

3

offer the Court by November h We have told the leadership

4

of the House and the Sentafe that and that is the theory in

5

which the state had. operated.

Q

Do you get any more optimistic prediction

of when these 1970 figures will be available?
A

Well, no, sir. Mr. Justice Brennan, the

figures are sifcll they say now that possibly in June but Mr.

10

(Krogenfeld?'s figures as in the trial August of 1971 because

11

they have to break them down by

12

tracts in populace areas means by blocks. And so we cannot

13

get them on tape

14

until August of 1971.

Can it be, unless the governor calls it?

Well there is a proceedure that the House

— the census figures computed in Arisona

It is nationwide, Mr» Justice White, but

But not by census tracts,—

80 percent of our population resides in 2 big counties. And

10

if we don’t know, that’s Mr. Shea’s principle complaint,

1.1

the present system, is he says that we have used the wrong

12

formula for allocation internally in the big counties.

13

We use what the Court used in 1966, we put the

14

1968 registration on a formula and put them to the actual

Q

Bo I understand under the opinion below,

17

you can no longer construct a reapportionment plan on the

18

basis of registered voters. You’ll have to do it on population,

won't you?

That’s correct, Your

And you can’t do it on population by larger

No, sir, we have no way of knowing where

the people are. The difficulty of the last decade—

No, sir. We havemulti-member

forthe

Q

13

So youdo need on the single member dis­

you would still need for the House—

Yes, sir. We have to, in 1960, one of the

— ?

areas of our county that has now 30,000 people didn't even
exhist. That's Sun City. It was a cottonfield. And so that's
why we had to use the Court itselfin 1966 used the projected
{
registration to thfe 1960 census.
The legislature and the governor — sought direction,
because it's the leadership of the House and Senate they were
27

1

attorneys and they asked ns to ask an advisory opinion which

2

of course the Court cannot give us.

3

They have made every effort to blindly follow the

4

direction of the Courts and they stand now ready to do, But

5

they are now up there on the floor, they cannot do anything

6

until the census tracts come out this summer.

7

It's as the Court in its, we had 200 runs of the

8

computer to effect this present system. Every district was

9

less than 1 percent deviation. Which no other state in the

10

Union can brag about. We had every district, all of our 30 dis­

11

tricts had less than 1 percent, the maximum, of 8,7 deviation,

12

wa have done out best to comply with the Court's directive,

13

and now we await the coming

14

and further comply. Thank you,

IS

Q

of the census tracts go forward

What reason have you to think that legis­

16

latures being what they arethey would do anything different

17

in the hearafter than they have done now?

18

A

Because, Mr. Justice Black, the present

19

legislature are the beneficiaries of the reapportionment plan.

20

Before the reapportiomaent plan, the present majority would

21

never have been there. Because we had 2 from each county, and

22

Maricopa County with 700,000 people had 2 Senators. Now we

23

have 15, so it's to their own self interest to maintain the

24

fair, equitable, lawful reapportionment.

A

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP J. SHEA, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

4

MR. SHEA: I'd like to respond briefly, if I may,

5
6

Yes,, sir.

to a couple of points. The first one is critically important.

7

That is the availability of the figures, because

8

that has so much to do with timing. It is said that we now

9

have the population of 1870, the population figures by county.

10

Well that is to say that the 1970 population figures by

11

county is published in a little pamphlet that you buy for

12

35 cents. It doesn't mean it's the only figures available.
It said that this summer, possibly in June, the

13
14

other figures, the more complete figures, whcih we all agree

15

are necessary, the census tract figures, are available on

16

tapes.
Well, it you call this number here, of the U.S. Census

17
13

Bureau, in Washington, D,C, and they'll say well, we don't

19

have them on tapes and we don't have them on our brochure
that costs 35 cants, but they're there. You see they're

20
21

there if anybody had the will to dig them out and find out these

22

things.

23
24
25

Q

Well I know, but will they be given the

official impromatur if you were to go today, and ask for
them and they would say go ahead and look at the book? Thfce them

29

1

2

off? Will they certify that those are the official 1970 figures!
I don't know if there is any process of

A

1

3

impromatur certification, at any stage. All I'm saying is that

4

they're available.

S

Q

Ordin.ar.lfy aren't these done on the basis

6

of some officially certified population figures, isn’t that

1

the way you base these reapportionment plans?

8

A

I don't know, Mr. Justice Brennan.

9

Q

1 thought they were. I thought most of the

10

cases we've had here have referred to census figures which

11

I thought were officially certified figures.

12

13
14

A

Well, I don't know if they're officially

certified, and then perhaps now and if they have not been—

were required to open the door, you wanted to

bring in? Where would you get the basic figures?
A

I'd get them from the United States .

Department of the Bureau of the Census in Washington, D.C.
Q

You get the figures then in August they put

out a new set of figures they'd have to ; reapportion, again.
There are only one set of figures that have any bearing in the
Coutt and the Census Bureau — certify. It has a gold seal
on it, am I right?
A

I'm frankly not familiar with the process
30

1

of the certification of the figures,

E

Q

Would you say, Mr. Shea, 1 gather you

3

do not share Mr. McGowan's optimism at all on the changes that

4

have occurred in

5

hood to accomplish this objective in a special session which

6

he assures us will be held. You don't share that feeling?
A

7
8

the legislature up to now, and their likli-

Mr. McGowan and 1 are in complete dis­

agreement.

9

Q

10

A

Why?
Because my experience is that a iegisla-

11

ture does not reapportion itself so as to decimate its leader-

12

ship. And that's what's going to have to happen.
Q

13

Well, the last reapportionment created a

14

new leadership and as Justice Harlan suggested a new set of

15

interests —— do you agree with that?
A

16

Yes, 1 do. But, now that those new set of

17

figures are going to have to disappear. Because they all can't

18

get returned if the right thing is done. That's the problem

19

with temporizing with unconstitutional plans.
Q

20

You don't think that — suggestion of the

21

three judge court is going to have any impact on the legis­

22

lature?

23

A

No.

24

Q

It's true that the Court did not order,

25

. '"

~:

but the statea obviously, according to Mr. McGowan's represen-

1

tation has treated the courts — suggestion and as though

2

it had been an order, commanded,it.

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

Have they?

5

A

I’ll take his word

for it. In other

6

words; the leaders sit around in a room and they say, well

7

you know the Court said by November 1 ---

8

Q

Have theyacted?

0

A

Mo. He1 says that they intend to act before

10

November 1, 1971 because they regard it

11

moral time limit.

12

13

Q

as some kind of a

But he also ties that time on to the

availability of the figures, does he not?

14

A

Right, and that8s what I dispute, too.

15

Q

Certainly — I do not read this as a

IS

dilatory action, but as a ©presentation made to this Court by

17

a responsible Counsel, that these figures will be available

18

by June, perhcips, but within 60 days thereafter and that

19

the legislature will be in a special session. You challenge

20

that?

21

A

No, I don’t, sir.

22

Q

Do you believe that he can make good -—

23
24
25

as to what the legislature will do?
A

Well, he

makes the statement in all good

faith, and he is a man who is close fcfa the leadership and I'm
32

i

sure he's accurately reporting what he advises them and what

2

they say they will do» I have no doubt that they'll get

3

some figures and go into a special session, but I have every

4

doubt in the world that they're going to, as 1 say, decimate

5

their leadership.

6
7
8

Q

I think then that — have to be tried

out again in the court.,
A

We*re going to go back to Court, I have no

9

doubt about it. And when we go back to Court it will be 1972

10

and then they'll say it’s too late to appeal again, and then

11

9 years will pass, so I think that what we’d like to do is

12

have it straightened outnow.

13

Q

Thank you, Mr» Shea, thank you, Mr. McGowan

14

the case is submitted.
