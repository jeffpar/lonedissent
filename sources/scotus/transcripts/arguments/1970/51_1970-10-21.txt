view those cases very carefully, it is interesting to note

that they infer throughout the decision itself that it should

21

unfortunately,

22

that and, as a result, the states across this country havd

Attorney General.

As far as retroactivity is concerned, I don’t think
this Court has to go that far.

I don’t think — of course,

10

the arguments 1 would espouse would be the same as that ex­

tl

pressed in the Williams case,, that here is a. case that is on

12

direct appeal, that one of the differences, and big differences

13

that I think this Court should consider, when a case is on

14

direct appeal, and one that is being attacked collaterally from

13

the standpoint of retroactivity, is the fact that on direct

16

appeal certainly the government and the Attorney General and

17

all those prosecutors should be fully aware that there is al­

IS

ways the possibility that the case will be reversed, and they

19

should keep their- witnesses and keep their evidence and keep

20

all the things necessary to prosecute the case again in abey­

keep the case together?

federal -

I would

17

just like to indicate to the Court that this case,

right from

13

the outset,, was attacked on the Rabinowitz and Harris theory,

19

that really Chimel was not a criteria so far as taking this

20

case up, and that during the whole procedure up, it was a very

21

difficult question.

22

was because of the expanded critical decisions of Fabinowitz

23

and Harris as we have gone along in time.

24

when they indicated they are opening a Pandora's door, was not

25

as the Attorney General indicates in this case, opening a

situation where every case is a person who is not in that par­

2

ticular apartment, then all of a sudden you open the door in

3

that area.

4

What they are talking about really was Rabinowifcz

5

and Harris gave the government wide latitude in the search.

6

How, we are going to go into a situation where the person

7

doesn't even have to be there? then all of a sudden you come

8

to the situation where really there just isn't going to be any

exceptions to amount to a material reason why they cannot

search once they have the arrest.
And I would submit, in the interest of justice,

12

particularly in this case, and I am arguing particularly in

13

this case, because of the situation where the equities should

14

come out where here an individual has served his fifth year on

13

a minimum one-year, has never been up for parole, because he

16

is convicted of a kidnapping charge that he clearly did not do

17

at the time, • and the courts -~

18

Q

Did you say that conviction has been set aside-

19

A

Yes, Your Honor.

20

Q

— in other proceedings on a habeas

21

A

That was set aside.

22.

Q

And I presume that is the problem of the state

23

cprus --

courts of California to deal with the length of this sentence.

25

Q

Yes, Your Honor.’
Is that issue before us?
II

I

A

It really is not.

I are just indicating this

2

as an equitable situation when you are drawing a very close

3

line on this case, because the trial courts in California

4

knew about Rabinowits, Knew about Harris.

5

made that statement in the record at the time.

6

appeals reversed 3-to-O against, and it is just not that clear-

7

cut of a case, and I think sometimes in those types of cases

that information like that might be helpful.

ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GEORGE, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
MR. GEORGE:

14

This is a reargument in a direct appeal

13

from a state conviction.

16

the search and seizure which occurred in petitioner's apartment

17

in 1966.

13

Chimel decision, there are two or three issues involving the

19

legality of the search under pre-Chimel law.

20

The sole issues in this case involve

And aside from the issue of the retroactivity of the

Before reaching these issues, however, I would like

21

to quickly dispose of the new element that petitioner has

22

injected into the case, namely this collateral proceeding in

23

the California courts whereby, I believe, within a month pre­

24

viously the kidnapping count was set aside, but that was on

25

a state law ground and that is not even a final judgment.
12

1

That is being appealed to the Court of Appeals.

2
3

Q

You said a month previously.

A month previous­

A

Sometime within the last month* I believe* it

ly to --

4

3

was* and that is not even final yet and* frankly* I don't see

6

any bearing on it.

7

robbery count* which carries a maximum of life imprisonment,

8

remains.

9

since that time* not applicable to him, the statute provides

The kidnapping count has gone but the

In fact* although petitioner's minimum is one year,

10

for a fifteen-year minimum whereas here there is bodily injury

11

to the victim* so that is really —

12

Q

Well* let's not spend any more time on that.

13

A

So basically, getting to the search and seizure

14

issue* I would like to again outline the facts* although coun­

15

sel has* because they are a bit confusing and I don't think a

16

complete statement has been given.
On Saturday* June 4* 1966* a robbery was committed

17

18

involving a brutal assault and unnecessary assault by a gang of

19

four armed men* one of whom is petitioner* and this is part of

20

a series of robberies in the San Fernando Valley area of Los

21

Angeles.

22

.

Mow* two days later the police acquire probable cause

23

to arrest petitioner* and petitioner* at page 10 of bis opening

24

brief* really concedes that there is probable cause to arrest

25

him, so there is no need to dwell in detail on that.
13
I

1

What the police do is they proceed to petitioner’s

2

apartment,, they do not have a search warrant or an arrest

3

warrant, they go in order to seize the weapons and the stolen

4

property that is involved with the robbery in the present case.

3

And this is even arguably done with the consent of one of the

6

other robbery gang members who is in custody, but that is not

7

central fcc the case»

3

The police —

9

Q

To whom are you referring when you say in cus-

A

That is Mr. Bader.

10

today?

it
12

He is one of the four men.

Baum and Bader were arrested —

13

Q

He has told them about all of this?

14

A

He has told them about this and they have inde­

15

pendent information in their files connecting petitioner with

16

these two men and with a series of robberies in that area.

!7

So the police --

13

Q

Bader was the petitioner’s roommate, wasn’t he?

19

A

That’s correct.

20

Q

And it is not your submission, is it, or is it,

21

that Bader gave consent to this earch?
A

22
23

cause he said,

24

the loot

25

is
Q

Well, I stated that arguably that he did, be­
"You can go to the apartment and that is where
and the weapons are."
That wasn’t the basis on which this was upheld
14

1

by the Supreme Court of California, was it?

2

A

Ho, although I noted briefly in respondent's

3

brief that we don't think that is dispositive of the fact that

4

that was not the ground upheld by the appellate court.

5

injected that, that we seek to uphold the validity of the

6

search on other grounds.

I just

How, what the police do is they knock and they

7
8

identify themselves and they are confronted by a man who opened

9

the door and who looks exactly like petitioner Hill, and they

10

have descriptions of petitioner Hill from the victims, of which

u

there were three, although not all of them gave a full descrip­

12

tion.

13

description from petitioner's roommate, and they have their own

14

information from their files involving previous arrests of

15

petitioner.

IQ

But they had general descriptions and they have a fourth

So they go there and there is a man who the record

17

later indicates is only ten pounds off in weight and two

18

inches in height, and these are discrepancies which would not

19

necessarily be apparent to the officers and could be accounted

20

for by any, let's say, ambiguity in the victims1 description.

21

Q

Two courts, the trial court has found as a

22

matter of fact there was no bad faith, and the court of appeals

23

has affirmed that, haven't they?

24

A

That is correct, so —

25

G

I think the court of appeals reversed the
15

1

conviction* and then the state took it to the Supreme Court

2

where it was affirmed.
A

3

4

That is correct,, but the court of appeals did

affirm the validity of the arrest --

S

Q

The good faith, yes.

6

A

— yes, and the arrest is such that they had a

7

rather curious approach to the legality of the seareh which

Q

I mentioned in passing.

9

Q

Yes.

10

A

Wow, what happens is, before the officers en­

11

tered the apartment, they see a gun with a loaded clip in plain

12

view from the threshold of the apartment, sitting on the coffee

13

table.

16

They ask this man,

He is asked,

24

the officers supposed to believe that, when he doesn't know

25

anything about a gun in plain sight?

"How did you get in here?"

So he is also

"Well, I don't know,,

"Where is petitioner Hill?"

18

But are

1

So they are entitled, as Justice Black stated in a

2

previous argument today, to assume that the person who opens

3

the door, especially when he matches the tenant’s description,,

4

is the person in control.

5

Nov/, this is where the divergence begins in the

6

treatment of the case between the court of appeal and the state

7

supreme court.

8

gested by petitioner that somehow what is important in ascer­

9

taining the legality of a search is not the dominion and control

The court of appeal adopted the approach sug­

10

of the person over the premises in a physical sense, but it is

11

somehow his proprietary control that matters.

12

Well, this is a concept that, I believe, this Court

13

has rejected time and time again in the Jones case, the

14

Silverman case, and I think finally buried in the Katz case,

15

that the right to search incident to arrest, whatever its scope,

16

does not depend upon proprietary matters but, rather, upon the

17

physical dominion and control, because, after all, it is for

13

the officerps protection.

19

that clearly we are concerned with the ability of the person

20

to grab a weapon -- all of these cases indicate that thi3 is

21

the consideration.

And I think that Katz indicates

aspect of this case.

The risk that the public will have access to the

Now, I think that the Stoner opinion itself recog­

Now, I think what is important here is that if you

15

assume that Hill was there, the search that took place was

16

totally proper.

17

permissible under pre-Chimel law, and the fact that this mis­

treatment of it.

Now, one thing I would like to get into, after

2

concluding now that the scope of the search was unexceptional,

the items being found in the bedroom, is this question of the

diary-

5

lar novelty to this case under pre-Chimel law.

I think, other than that, there can't be any particu­

6

Now, first of all, we would like to state strenu­

7

ously that we believe that issue is improperly raised before

3

this Court.

It has been —

9

Q

You raise no objection, you say?

10

A

Not on this ground, no.

In fact, perhaps the

11

making of an objection on other grounds is affirmatively in­

12

dicative of the waiver of an objection on this ground.

13
14

Q

Well, the objection actually made was on Fourth

Amendment grounds?
i

15
16
17

A

On Fourth Amendment grounds to all of the evi­

dence in general -Q

Well, what do you do with that statement in

18

Boyd, that where you are dealing with something like the diary,

19

incriminating statements, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments al­

20

most run into one another.

21

A

Well, that language does appear, I think —

22

Q

I mean for the purposes of the sufficiency of

23

the objection raised, in the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth

24

Amendment context.

25

A

Well, I don't think that that can really be
20

1

dispositive of the issue or even that significant

after ail, if we look at the purpose of an objection, it is to

apprise opposing counsel and the trial court of the basis for

the objection

5

Q

because,

Yes, but doesn't the objection on Fourth Amend-

6

ment grounds as to the diary only necessarily implicate the

7

Fifth Amendment consideration on the issue of reasonableness?

8

A

I would say particularly not, in view of the

9

novel nature of this allegation, because I know of no cases

TO

under California law or under federal law applicable to the

IT

states where it has been held that because this is a document

12

that alone allows its admission in evidence, so —

13
14

Q

Incidentally, are those pages anywhere in the

record, those diary pages?

15

A

Yes, the diary can be found at --

What the diary says, on page 77 of the

17

Appendix, in a footnote to the opinion of the Supreme Court

of California --

And on page 41 it is, as the Supreme Court of

20

California concludes, a damning account of petitioner's in­

21

volvement — it is a rather unusual thing, it relates the fact

22

of the robbery and that the -- some of this is in criminal

23

jargon, but in effect "some of the members of the gang, " in­

24

cluding petitioner,

25

scored seven keys" — which means purchasing seven kilos of

And then, when they came back, they went to

5

then "this turned out to be the mistake" —

6
7
8

Q

Well, this is a detailed confession to the

commission of the crime, isn't it?
A

That's correct, made under absolutely no com­

9

pulsion whatsoever, in view of the fact that criminals do not

10

customarily confess their crimes with the introductory phrase

If

"dear diary, yesterday I did so and so."

12

that is totally volunteered, and that brings me really to the

13

merits of this claim of a Fifth Amendment basis.

14

This is something

Let me just state briefly, though, this was not

15

raised at the preliminary hearing, not at the trial court, not

16

the court of appeals, not the Supreme Court of California, not

17

even in the petition for writ of certiorari.

18

19

rules, I think that precludes it, but on the merits I think

20

that Gouled itself, whose mere evidence rule was at least to

21

very substantial degree rejected in Warden vs. Hayden, pre­

22

cludes the claim made here.

to become a witness against himself to violate the Fifth

Amendment.

whether there are items of evidentiary value, whose very nature

precludes them from being the object of a reasonable search

procedure.

This case thus does rot require that we consider

Doesn't that reserve this question?

X think that that language, in conjunction

with whatever this Court would want to do in the future, cer­

Slow, I would like to cover one aspect of the search

2

before getting to the retroactivity question, namely the law­

fulness of the search under Chi reel, because we do not in any

way feel that the retroactivity issue is dispositive of this

case.

6

cases upon which it relies have held that the requirement for

7

the search warrant should not routinely be dispensed with, but

8

that where it is impracticable to obtain a search warrant,

that one need not toe obtained.

And 1 think it is important to note that Chixnel and the

that comes within the exigent circumstances exception to

In Chitael, of course, the officers had weeks to ob­

let's look at the chronology

leading up to the search.

16

Monday, two days latere did the officers acquire their probable

ce-u.se to arrest petitioner.

18

would have had to wait well over twelve hours to obtain a

search warrant and perhaps more.

The offense was committed late on

They

20

It occurred to me that the
%
first Tuesday in California, at least, is a court holiday in

21

the month of June in election years,, so this really might be a

22

thirty*six hour wait instead of a twelve hour wait.

23

How, was there any reason why they shouldn't wait

24

this day or two?

Well,

the officers knew that there was a

25

fourth member of the robbery gang at large.
28

This gang was

armed and dangerous.

stolen property were at petitioner"s apartment* thus time was

4

of the essence.

very close to a hot pursuit situation, and there were these

6

reasons for not delaying the search until a search warrant

7

could foe obtained.

They had committed several other robber­

ox the gang just two and a half hours before the search here

12

might alert petitioner to flee from the apartment and perhaps

13

from the jurisdiction; and,,

14

arrested that evening and the search of the apartment delayed

15

another day or two,

16

back, being alerted by petitioner's arrest or the arrest of

17

the two other men, Bader and Baum, and realized that the of­

8

Fow, one related problem,, of course, is what can 'be

done to secure the.' premises, and that is one of the most seri­

ous problems,, and in California our view is that the premises

l. :.afc I would like to note, in conclusion, as far as
the impact of this decision, is that this strikes at the most
sensitive nature of police wort, the type of property crime,
burglaries particularly, where the rate of recovery is lowest„
It might be of interest t© Your Honors to note that less than

how, when the time it takes to obtain a search war­
rant in each case, which is several hours, is multiplied by
the hundreds of situations every day that occur necessitating
one under the Chime 1 decision, one can see the impact of this
decisions.

One can easily point to one case or the other

case and say a warrant could have been obtained here, but if
one looks at the overall impact, it is quite apparent with
two million burglaries being committed annually in this
country, 265,000 of them in California, that there is indeed
a real problem of just not getting snowed under by police
work.

I think that argument was 'made —

11

Q

Yes.

12

A

But improperly stated it.

The point that I

13

would like to make is that we draw some happy medium and drop

14

it from maybe thirty officers to one officer on direct appeal.

15

Those cases certainly out-number, at least on a 30:1 basis.

Well, retroactivity wouldn't require anymore

You can't un-ring a bell.

that is already past, you don't need any officers.

In other

1 thought the point he was trying to bring ©ut was

3 I

the fact that if you make it completely retroactive you are

i

4 i

going to accumulate a lot of this evidence based on past cases.
And now I am saying that if you have to get additional man­
power, that if you make it only on direct appeal, certainly a
30i 1 ratio isn't unreasonable in light of- all the years that

8

are involved prior to Chime1 versus the cases on appeal.

And I would like to conclude with this last point,

10

that I was going to mention until counsel mentioned about the

11

numbers of crimes and so forth.

numbers can toe misleading.

to kidnapping -where, in fact, Carl Chessman died under this

this case, and certainly he was subjected to the death penalty

18

also,, and yet it would have been totally unreasonable in this

19

case, just as we indicated, it would have been totally un­

20

reasonable to go into the bedroom and to get that diary and

21

there is no indication that this particular diary was in a

book.
