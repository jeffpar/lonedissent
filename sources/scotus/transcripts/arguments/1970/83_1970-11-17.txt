OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. QUINN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
This matter is here on appeal from an interlocutory order of
the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, under the provisions of 28 United States Code 1253.
That provides for direct appeal from an order for judgment of
a three-judge court granting temporary injunctive relief agains
enforcement of a state statute.
In our view this appeal presents two equally impor­
tant issues which ought to be finally resolved by this Court.
The first is whether the Court below abused its discretion in
enjoining the District Attorney from prosecuting in the future
on account of the showing of the film, ”1 Am Curious Yellow,”
which the Court below assumed to be obscene.
The second is whether under this Court9s holding in
Stanley versus Georgia, any state can constitutionally prohibit
public, commercialized dissemination of pornographic matter,
absent distribution to minors, nonconsenting adults or by
3

i

pandering»
The facts may he stated briefly as follows; on

z
3

June 30, 1969, after preliminary proceedings not relevant here,

4

the Appelles filed an amended complaint to the Court hcilow,

S

alleging the reason to believe that indictments would be

6
7

sought against them by Attorney General Quinn's office under
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 272, Section 28A»
§hort3,y thereafter the indictments were, in fact,

8
9

sought and returned.
Appellees sought a declaration that the statute is

10

11
12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

unconstitutional and art injunction against prosecution there­
under.

They alleged the statute was overbroad because, amonq

other things, adequate adequately controlled commercial distri­
bution of obscene material is protected foythe First Amendment.
The Court declined to grant injunctions or other
relief but requested briefs oh the questions regarding the
scope of this Court's holding in Stanley versus Georgia, and the
effect of that opinion on the Massachusetts statutes.

Prosecu­

tion continued in the state court in its January session and the
Appellees were convicted.

Following their conviction the

Appellees removed their request for injunefeive relief.
After further argument, the majority of the Court
below held that Stanley versus Georgia went so far as to pro­

23
M

hibit state prosecutions with respect to adequately-controlled
public distribution of obscene materials, and the Court decided

25
4

1

that the Massachusetts statute was probably unconstitutional as

2

being overbroad on its face»

3

of the Court below enjoined the Appellants from further prosecu­

4

tion with respect to showing the film, "I Am Curious Yellow»"

5

This matter was argued before this Honorable Court

Based on this opinion the majority

6

on April 30th? was subsequently ordered for rearguraent.

7

meantime the Appellees' appeal was taken to the State Court?

8

oral argument in the Massachusetts Judicial Court has been

9

delayed under motions for postponement filed by the Appellees

We have only been able to find one instance where

3

this Court approved relief granted against a state law en­

case was a raatterof civil rights advocacy»

Its record is

We have none of that here»

Here we have, first of all, activities whose

15

dominant theme is offensive to community standards of morality?

17

whose appeal is to a prurient interest in sex? whose contents

both parties I think that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court would schedule the case for oral argument at the earliest
convenient date.
Q

They do ao if what?

A

I think if, pending a visit by the Appellees

and the Appellants here to the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts, the Court would immediately have scheduled that
case for oral argument there.
Q

Well, I understand as of now the oral argument

has been postponed unfci.1 after the decision of this Court in
this — in these proceedings.
Q

That is correct.

Q

May I ask you another cuestion, Mr. Quinn?

A

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
9

Q

i

Does the record in this case show any proffer

2

on file part of the State of Massachusetts of evidence tending

3

to show pandering by the advertising news , to advertise and

4

tout this film?

5

A

It does not, Your Honor.

6

Q

Does it show anything in the natuss of evidence

7

that, in fact,, minors were not excluded? that there was no good

S

faith effort to keep them from attending?

9

A

It does not* Your Honor.

10

Q

You are going narrowly on this one central

11

issue, independent of either pandering or access of minors?
A

12

That is correct, Your Honor.

On whether, as I

13

have said, whether in the second issue to be considered by the

14

Court, whether- under the Court’s holding in Stanley versus

15

m

n

25

Georgia,

any

state

can

constitutionally prohibit any public

commercialized dissemination of pornographic matter without any
consideration to this distribution being to minors or noncon­
senting adults or by pandering.
And I have addressed myself to the first argument,
which I believe is basic to my appearance before this Honorable
Court, that of whether the Court below abused its discretion in
enjoining the Prosecuting Attorney from prosecuting in the
fgtur© on account of showing of a film which has been adjudged
by a competent court as obscene.
Q

But, if you are sustained you
10

never get t© the

1

merits of the film?

A

That is true* Your Honor, unless the Court in

Q

They 'got to the merits of the film up in the

its —

Maryland case.
A

I think last week this Honorable Court heard a

1

lot of arguments on the merits of that film and on the issue

8

of proscribing obscenity; that is correct, Mr, Justice»

9

1 have suggested"that in this case pending we have

10

the classic example for the application of the principle of

2.5

We further submit that if Statute 272.,. Section 28A
should be read to be overbroad in the light of the most recent
decisions of this Court in Stanley versus Georgia, that t. at
clause could be overcome by a decision and by a narrow con­
struction made in that decision by our Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court in the single case now pending before the Court»
This would avoid the constitutional defects and it would
further avoid any possible irritant to the Federal-State rela­
tionship which is a matter of grave concern to this Court and
a matter of grave concern to all of us in the field of criminal
justice administration in the United States of America,
Merely to assume that the statutory validity of the
Massachusetts law is affected by Stanley versus Georgia,

We

think this Court ought to leave for the state in its court, to

11

1

interpret sad fco limit the application of the state statutes

2

within that holding or Stanley versus Georgia,

3
4

Similarly, as -this Honorable Court itself has sub­
sequently limited the application of Stanley versus Georgia,

S

My brother, the Solicitor General, will discuss the

■6

substance of the second issue which we have touched upon in

7

the questions put before me: that relating to the constitutional

8

rights of any state or any government to proscribe obscenity

9

within the framework of the First Amendment to our United

10

States Cons titution,
I respectfully submit again that this Court has

11
12

heard many arguments in this issue, during this term as well

13

as the term before, and 1 will leave the burden of that

14

argument to my brother, the Solicitor General,
For these reasons it is respectfully submitted that

15
16

the judgment below should be reversed,

17

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Quinn.

20

ORAL ARGUMENT BY PETER L. STRAUSS, OFFICE

21

OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF THE

22

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

23

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Strauss.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

24

the Court:

as the Court knows, the Government appears here

25

today only with respect to the issues in this case involving

1

the meaning of its decision two terms ago. in Stanley versus

2

Georgia and as the Court knows , that decision has led to a

3

good deal of ferment in this general area# including the in­

4

validation of two central Federal statutes which we shall be

5

appearing here later in the term to defend.
The facts of Stanley we 'think are significant.

6

The

7

police, almost by accident, searching through an individual's

a

home for other purposes, cams upon three reels of motion

9

pictures and other iteias which no one knew were there.

10

11
12

looked through those films, concluded -that they were obscene?
arrested Mr. Stanley for possession of obscene matter underGeorgia statute which permitted punishment for that purpose.
The case came here and the Court held in what I

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

They

think was carefully limited language that the mere possession
of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime.
Excuse me.
Q

Was there any showing in the Stanley case that

the possession had been for or was intended for commercial
profit or public showing?
A

None whatsoever.

To- us the central fact in

Stanley really was the very accidental nature s no one knew that
Mr. Stanley had that material or certainly no one in the gener­
al public knew that, before it was discovered by happenstance
in his desk.

Well, not quite happenstance, the officers were

there searching for other material.
13

They certainly didn't

1

expect to find that*

2
3
4
5
6

7
8
B
10

II
12

Q

So that the issue of public showing or pander-^

ing by advertising before public showing were not involved in
the

Stanley case at all?
A

I don't think it8s necessary, Mr, Chief

Justice, to go so far as to be as gentle with Stanley as to
say the issue of pandering wasn't in that case.

I would put

it: the issue of public knowledge was not in that case.
And this Court, 1 think was quite careful in its
statement regarding that case, to indicate that it was simply
a matter of private possession that was before it and that that
was all that -the holding meant.

Lower courts, however, have

13

not been so minded about the opinion and there is, as the

U

Court knows, and I am sure this Court feels is a good deal of

15

impatience about this very troublesome issue of obscenity and

IS

ther® are, in the opinion, here and there, remarks which could

17

be taken in the way that the Courts below here have taken them;

18

that if one is careful, if one is striet, access to the movie

10

to those who want to sea it and to those who are adult enough

20

so that ordinary parans patria considerations do not some into

21

effect and if one doesn't offend sensibilities byadvertising,

22

why then one has the constitutional right to show the movies, to

23

commercially exploit it.

M
25

And again, Mr. Chief Justice has brought it up,

■

I want to stress that we don't ■— we aren't talking here about
14

?

commercial exploitation in the sense of the Ginsberg casa, in

2

a pandering senses simply public sale unadorned by any kind of

3

special attention on the hypotheses of this case to the

4

sexual aspects of the sexual provocative aspects of the film.

S

I should like to start my discussion a little way

6

off from the obscenity question but in a way that I think

7

again calls attention to the central character of public know­

8

ledge ©f what8s going on.

9

Let us suppose that a traveling carnival should

10

come to Washington, set up tents that are perfectly well en­

11

closed and screened from public view and announce that in those

12

tents for those who wish to pay and come and see it, -there

13

will be a bear-baiting contest in which five dogs and a chained

14

bear will be set against each other until some or all of the

15

participants are dead.

16

in perfect safety for all of the viewers.

17

Let's suppose that that could be done

X think that it may be perfectly clear that no one

18

would leave that tent to commit an act of violence and X think

19

it may also be clear that no one who would wish not to see the

20

scene in the tent would be 'forced to do so, but X submit it's

21

also clear that the community to which that carnival came,

22

could prohibit it if it were so minded.

23

Now,that's a public policy question on which all

24

might not agree but X think if the community decided to pro­

25

hibit that show it could do so.

15

The distress which is caused

1

fco -those who don't come, but who know what's going to go on in

z

the tent, who knew for a certainty what will appear, and that

3

is a very real distress.

20

The long-term brutalization of society which the
society may fear the result? the strain on social fabricthrough public tolerance of what is to many members of that
society, utterly repellant.

All of these factors, it would

seem to me, to justify such regulations.
It has never been held that society lacks power to
protect the sensibilities or to deal with these occurrences;
that it must not only tolerate, but in the meaningful sense,
legitimize these activities.
Q

Do you think your hypothatical would be quite

so clear if what were shown inside the tent were a movie of a

bear-baiting contest or are you going to get into that?
A

Yes; I think it would be as clear.

It's

inconceivable to me that the Court would extend less protec­
tion to a theatrical performance than it does to

firm just

because the performance happened to be live, rather than pre­
served on acetate.
Q

I suppose'a community —~ most communities do

21

22

make bank robbery a criminal offense, but would a movie showing
a bank robbery be a criminal offense on the part of the ~

23

No; but neither would a ^:age production.

A

For the bears and the dogs — excuse me — for

the bears and the dogs„ they commit no crime.

7

offense of cruelty to animals which I think is what you are

a

referring to, but I think that is an entirely analogous offense

9

to the obscenity offense.

It is an offense designed to pro-

to

fcecf human sensibilities.

just stated,

whatsoever if Bonnie and Clyde were presented on the stage

20

rather than in the form of a moving picture; that’a part of my

point,

Q

Do you think that the state could ban it?

Well, if I understand, you are at the point of

saying that obscenity is against the people in the community's

mores customs and beliefs,, and I am merely asking you isn't

That's the only point

I suppose such statutes have been generally

thought to be more difficult to administer without saying
whether it was Bonnie and Clyde in particular#

I suppose it

will lure a statute which could suffieientlyand carefully
drawn as to which one could make the conclusion that was made
in law regarding obscenity legislation that it is not vague;
that a state could, indeed, prohibit the screen depiction of
certain forms of carnage; yes.
Q

Crime?

A

Yes.

Q

Mr. Strauss, it comes back to this earlier’

question: are there some forms of conduct which, if they occur
in private, are completely innocent and protected, that if
performed in public, are not protected?
A

Well, I think that's a matter of the Court.

least the forms of conduct that are coming to mind may be a
24
j

15

matter that the Court hasn't yet decided.

My question is: precisely directed at that.

7

and highly desirable to take a shower and you might find your­

8

self arrested if you took a shower in the center of Pennsyl­

10

A

That's certainly true.

11

Now if you, on the other hand, you cannot rob

12

a bank either in private or in public with impunity; can you?

law for any commercial setting.

called to the

Court's attention before; “there is much reference in that
opinion to notions of privacy and freedom from intrusion and
we feel those references are central.

The Government believes that the Court

The opinion quotes at length from Mr. Justice
Brandeis8s dissent in Olmstead.

It refers to the Griswold

opinion; Griswold versus Connecticut where the Court put it
this way; the present case concerns a relationship lying within
the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitu­

U

tional guarantees and it concerns a law which, in forbidding

IS

the use of contraceptives, rather than regulating their manu­

m

facture or sale, seeks to achieve its goald by means of having

17

a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship.

18

Stanley is an entirely similar case.

19

in which the state sought to regulate in a manner having a

It is a case

*

20

maximum destructive impact and this Court, I think quite

21

properly, said that it might not do so.

22

Q

On what originallyin the United States Consti­

tution do you understand the Stanley decision to have been

24

based?

25

notions of privacy — distress* really* on privacy as a co­
ordinate part of the opinion in that case»
In a way I think it's central to the Stanley
opinion* but unlike the other obscenity decisions in this
Court* the opinion does not talk about the material»

The

opinion refers to the rights of the person and not to the protected character of the material Or not»

And when one starts

talking about the individual, rather than what he may have and
the individual's First Amendment rights.

It wasn't that the

13
material was protected under the First Amendment* but that the
14

15

individual had First Amendment rights.

Then it becomes* I

think* clear that what we are dealing with, again* citation to
16
Griswold is a kind of penumbra! analysis which we.try and set
17
out in our brief* that to protect the individual's rights to

read* to learn* it is necessary to afford that kind of penum­
19

20
21

bra! protection in which matters which may not contain, infor­
mation* may not contain ideas* are nonetheless* ignored.
And again* I think the Court was very -careful* while

22
it did refer to a right to receive information and ideas, it
23
never once said that the material which he had was material

24
which contained information and ideas.

25
22

If it had said that*

then it would have been saying that that material would have

had First Amendment protection.

It didn't say that.

When, however, privacy of the home nad notions

19
20

opinion one must believe that the Fourth Amendmentvas resolved
and in any event, when the opinion so carefully discussed the

21
22
23

rights of the individual rather than the nature of the material,
I think one must be quite clear that the holding was not a
holding that these materials were in any sense protected by

It was a holding that the individual in

As the facts of the case show the

it private.

As long as he did so, society could claim no

greater interest in what was there than the supervision of his
own personal morals.

Mr, Stanley did not advertise to the world

That, this Court said, was not enough, and 1 think
the Court

was quite plainly correct in doing so.

there is no such privacy.

But here

Appellees proclaim to the world

what may be seen in their theater, however discreetly they may
d© it and that notoriety in itself changes the issue from an

13

issue of private morality to an issue of public morality be­

14

cause the contents of the film and its location are known to

15

the public, the Government must not only tolerate, but in an

16

important sense, legitimise that film. And if the film is ob­

Q

What you're saying, I take it, is; if the same

film that we're dealing with here is possessed by private per­

22

sons in the homes with no indications that they have it for

commercial purposes it would be completely protected under

Q

Well, but if the persons were, they can9t reach

the film as long as if remains in the house.
A

Well, that's true, but while these matters are

subtle, I think that one has to be very careful just because
of the risk of the kind of emanations with which one finds in
the lower court opinions today.

The lower courts rather care­

lessly, I think, have treated that opinion as going to the
material and treating the material as going to the material,
they have said, "Well, if an individual can have the material

11

then somebody has to have the right to sell it to him and

12

therefore, as long as he sells it to him in a proper way, every

13

thing is all right."

Mow, I think as we read the opinion, rather, one
would say: "In the circumstances of an"

Are you referring to the Stanley opinion now?

That's right.

As we read the Stanley opinion

W

one would have to say, rather, that in the circumstances of an

19

individual having a book or a film in his house which no one

20

knows about; the only interest in the state in regulating his

conduct is an interest in private morality and that, in no

circumstances, in the context of the First Amendment in the

rights, simply is not enough.

BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.

12

Thank you, Mr. Strauss.

MR. LEEWIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

When this case was argued last term among those

argued with it was Gunn versus University Committee, Number 7
last term, in which the Court dismissed the appeal on the last
dayof the terra when it set this case and its
over for

other companions

reargument on the ground that the three-judge dis­

trict court in Gunn had failed to enter any injunctive order
whatever and it was therefore, according to the Court's lan­

13

guage, "not possible to know with any certainty what the Court

14

has decided."

15

In this case, by contrast, the appeal order is

16

short and specific and it clearly discloses what the court

17

below has decided, and we submit that if that injunction if

18

analysed in terms of what it does not enjoin as well as in

1©

terms of what it does, it emerges as a permissible and proper

2©

action by the Federal District Court seeking to preserve for

21

state prosecutors and courts their proper role in the enforce­

22

ment of restrictions upon the distribution of obscenity, while

23

retaining the First Amendment rights of motion picture exhibi­

M

tors and distributors in the interim.

25

To the extent, 1 would submit, that the opinion of
26

the court below goes beyond the terns of the preliminary in-

2

junection and expresses views concerning the constitutionality

oft he statuta as an ultimate decision, it's nothing more than
an advisory opinion or, as we suggested in some of the cases
argued before the court yesterday, in terms of declaratory
judgment, which may be appealable by the state if it views it
as such, tofche Court of Appeals.
But the issue here, we submit, is framed by the
injunction which appears at pages 44 and 45 of this record.
Now, what does it enjoin?

The injunction prohibits and enjoins

the defendants, the state prosecutors, local district attorneys
and. the State Attorney General's office from pursuing, civilly
or criminally or other wise interfering with the Appellees8
exhibition of the film, "I Am Curious Yellow," so long as that
exhibition is conducted under certain specific circumstances,
which cover the areas of pandering and infrustion and it pro­
vides, in addition, that the orcter is not to prevent or in­

17

18

hibit in any way -the prosecution of a then-pending criminal
proceeding in the Masachusetfcs State Courts which was then on

who have shown award-winning films in the past, we re sentenced

Pursuant to that suggestion these Appellees,

feeling that that issue would be resolved ultimately, by this

Court, even, irrespective o f -how it would be resolved by the

22

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, acting on

the Federal Court's role in this case, some confusion may have

believe, just from those papers, as if in some way the Federal

Because, the consequences of

the action which cahsed the Federal District Court to issue the
preliminary injunction which it did, was the withdrawal

by the

prosecutor in the state courts of an agreement under which he
would permit the film to continue to show while the various

30

1

issues were being litigated through the Massachusetts courts.

In fact, what did the Court below do?

Its order

of the Court below and the language of Judge Aldrich who wrote

6

the opinion, which appears at page 37 of the record, concludes

7

with an explicit caveat to these Appellees, stating that the

Court voices no opinion as to the legal consequences if

9

plaintiffs exhibit their film under the protection of our

injunction and it is ultimately determined that our view was

II

mistaken and that such exhibition is properly considered

12

illicit.

13
14

In effect, what that language in Judge Aldrich8s
opinion states, is that the continued exhibition of the film,

IS

even under the protection o£ the injunction is still subject

16

to the risk that at the conclusion of whatever ultimate decis­

17

ion is reached on the various constitutional issues, these

18

Appellees may be prosecuted, in fact, retrospectively, for the

19

showing of the film which they engaged in during the entire

20

period of the litigation.

21

Sotthat i€ there is anything that is clear from the

22

terns of the order, it is that it in no way forecloses any

23

state court determination of any relevant issue and in fact,

24

does not, not only Under Dombrowksi, doesn't enjoin any state

No, Your Honor? we think it does not.

What it means is that, the prosecutor may not,

This case, if viewed as we think it properly should

20

be, as to what are the appropriate steps for a Federal District

21

Court to take when it has before it a case in which there is

22

some doubt as to the constitutionality of the statute under

23

which the state is proceeding? where the state has no injunc­

24

tion power and I think that’s important in this context.

2S

The State of Massachusetts has not authorised its
32

1

prosecutors to go to the court and obtain injunctions against

2

the showing of films.

3

to books, but none with respect to films.

It has an interim proceeding applicable

So, it authorises criminal prosecution.

4

Now, there

5

is a criminal prosecution with respect to the film under a

6

statute which is of questionable constitutionality, with

7

respect to a film which a Federal District Court has found

8

prior to its opening to foe not obscene, and Judge Aldrich took

9

notice of that, too, and that appears in his opinion.

And the

'10

film was shown in a very careful -- safeguards to avoid pander'

11

lug, in showing to minors and any intrusion of the upblic.

12

In- those circumstances the Federal District Court said, ,sXn

but the only thing they obtained

from the District Court is an order which prevented multiple

At that period of time, we submit, they are

That's exactlywhat we're talking about here.

Q

Let me go back to something you said earlier;

14

are you suggesting that it is a universal rule that everybody

IS

is offended by bear-baiting, for example?

16

A

No.

17

Q

I suspect many people would like to go to see

18

it; wouldn't they?

19

A

By all means.

20

Q

You are not suggesting, either,that everyone

21

100 percent would be offended by a public showering on Pennsyl

22

vania Avenue?

23

A

That's right.

Q

Well, then, idle fact that there is a differing

25

view on these matters doesn't really enter into it; does it?

A

Yes, it dees.

Wewouid argue that the constitu­

tion gives greater protection to the right of privacy in this
regard than the right to offend people by thrusting upon them
stimuli.

That is, everybody who wants to see somebody shower

5

-- assuming that would have some First Amendment protection,

6

could do it in a closed, private theater, there is no need to

7

do it on Pennsylvania Avenue where innocent people would be

§

offended.

9

And so 1 would say all doubts must be resolved in

10

favor of privacy, but this case presents no doubts.

11

nobody, not a single human being who was being offended because

12

a stimuli was being thrust on him.

13

human beings were being offended by passing by the Symphony

14

Cinema Theater and seeing the discreet sign saying: ”1 Am

The difference between showering on Pennsyl­

vania Avenue and the bank robbery of the Riggs Bank is that

the showering on Pennsylvania, you say, is illegal but the

showing of it is legal?

A

But not on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The showing

13

of the film of people showering on Pennsylvania Avenue would

14

be illegal; indeed, the showing of the film of people shower­

drawn down.

17

We would argue that a theater with the curtains

13

drawn down deserves more constitutional protection than a home

19

with the Shades drawn up; that one must look at the functional

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT II. QUINN,

3

ATTORNEY GENERAL OP MASSACHUSETTS, ON

4

BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. QUINN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

very briefly I choose to touch upon three items which

6

Court:

1

I think have been a part of the Appellees’ argument.
The first relates to what I think has been referred

8

9
10

to as a "novel” approach for law enforcement in the field of
obscenity.

The suggestion is, of course, that a customs case

II

in the Second Circuit is one that ought to invite the interest

12

of every state law enforcement official.

13

14

submit, is one aspect of an approach to law enforcement Of
which I want no part whatsoever.
For the first reason, I don't know how a state

15
16
17
18

19

could intervene into a Federal customs case.

22,
23
24
25

I know of no

provision that would entitle any of us who might be States
Attorneys General or District Attorneys, to step into this
Court to be ultimately bound.
For another reason: 1 am not prepared any more than

20
21

This, I respectfully

any other individual in this courtroom to make the assumption
that some imported film or other item is obscene and ought to
have my supervision immediately on its importation, to be
obscene.

*

.i think first any one of us in law enforcement,

would have to have an opportunity to make a judgment on the

2

facts» would have to see the film» as in this case, in our

8

must have been some assumption to the validity of the particular

9

Mr. Attorney General Quinn, it’s not entirely

23

clear in my mind as to when this five-and-a-half-monfch period

24

came, chronologically in this litiaation.

25

this film was freely shown?
59

When do you say

1

A

From the beginning of the — from the spring

2

of 1969, Mr. Justice Stewart, which 1 think was probably in

3

May, and then the indictment was sought sonetine around the

4

last week of June, by the District Attorney of Suffolk County

5

and there was action then taken by the Appellees in the Federal

6

Court, but there was no controlling action taken by the

7

Federal Court, nor was there any other action taken by the

8

District Attorney of Suffolk County; just one single indict”

9

merit- and during the time when these arguments

isued and when

10

the trial on the issue was held,in a jury-waived session in

!1

Suffolk Court, that covered a period of five-and-a-half months.

12

Q

It was that period, and I understood Mr. Lewin

13

to say, and you agree, if I understood him correctly, that

U

with respect to a moving picture film there-not,-in

15

Massachusetts, available a civil in rera action available to

16

the prosecutor, as contrasted with a book?

17

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

There is not that

18

remedy available to the prosecutor, but there is a remedy of

19

declaratory judgment which was at once endorsed by the Massa­

20

chusetts Supreme Judicial Court in its decision in Commonwealth

21

versus Baird, where these First Amendment issues are brought into

22

focus; and there has been other precedent in the Massachusetts

23

Court system for active approach taken by anyone asserting his

24

individual rights.

25

So, this film showed for five-and-a-half months in
60

1
2
3
4
5

the Massachusetts jurisdiction, notwithstanding the District
Attorney of Suffolk County had no opportunity to appeal in the
Second Circuit. ■
Of course, implicit in this is the fact that we
cannot assume that there were any threats on the part of the

6

District Attorney of Suffolk County over the Attorney General

1

of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this five-and-a-

8

half month period.

9

gest that a threat connotes illegal action on the part of a

10

11

There were no threats and I further sug­

state law enforcement official.
There was only one single action taken durina this

12

five-and -a-half month period.

13

by the District Attorney since that period; only the fact that

14

he will not pledge to undergo more further prosection should

15

this film be shown.

16

Appellees here after the finding.

17

that after the finding by a court of competent jurisdiction in

18

Suffolk County, that there is obscenity that any prosecuting

19

official, any law enforcement official who should take a pledge

20

that he would not move against the film, found in fact, to be

21

obscene in his jurisdiction, would not be upholding his sworn

22

duty to administer the law and to prosecute crine.

showing; this was after a finding of obscenity; this was after,

This was after the five-and-a-half month

61

1

I respectfully submit, a removal of that presumption which

2

must have existed on the part of individuals on the basis of

3

decision: the two-to-one decision in the Second Circuit.

4

I further suggest to this Honorable Court: what

S

else is a law enforcement official to do as far as these cases

6

areeoncerned if, over his shoulder, constantly is — I would

24

not use "the threat/1 but is the possibility of Federal Court
intervention in every action that might be undertaken by that
state law enforcement official in good faith in the pursuance
of his duty.

What else is he to do but stand still and, I

submit, let something now presumptively a crime, continue to
be perpetrated within his jurisdiction.
I would further suggest that if" we are to remove
the very pressing issue of obscenity from determination by this
Court or by any individual citizen, nobody has seriously sug­
gested that I have heard, that we not continue to apply the
limitations which were mentioned in the provisos in the injunc­
tion by the Court below. Those limitations that provided this
injunction shall not apply if the picture is advertised in a
manner pandering to prurient interest in sex; or shown to an
audience not warned of its possibly offensive character; or
if shown to children under the age of 18 years.
I respectfully submit that more constitutional
issues could be raised in any one of these three classifica­
tions than are raised in the whole issue of what is obscene

25
62

1

and not obscene under the concepts of definitions of obscenity

2

as outlined by this Court in Roth versus the United States.
We would have to wonder what size newspaper ad was

3
4

advertising in a manner pandering to prurient interest.

We

5

would have to wonder if showing the film in Disneyland with

6

all the cautions in the world, was, nevertheless, a failure to

7

warn of possible offensive character.

8

if some young people in these United States who coma from,

9

for example, the Mediterranean counties in their heritage, as

We would have to wonder

10

my own wife does, could not be allowed a greater degree of

11

maturity than age 18; or to those individuals of my own

12

heritage, who might have come from Northern Europen countries.
No; I hardly think that removing obscenity as pro­

13
14

scribed conduct could remove the problems that beset lav; en­

15

forcement officials and this Honorable Court alike, in the area

16

of obscenity.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER L. STRAUSS, OFFICE

22

OF TIIE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

23

MR. STRAUSS:

I think, in fact, Mr. Chief Justice,

that the 20 minutes that I was allotted by the Court had ex­
pired, I think the only thing that I would wish to note on the
63

1

issue* of Griswold versus Connecticut,, counsel sought to bring

2

that case to his aid.

3

that case were a statute prohibiting birth control clinics, we

4

would be in for a much harder time of relying on it.

5

statute involved in that case is the statute which prohibited

6

married couples from using contraceptives.

7

down that statute in a prosecution against the directors of

8

the clinics as aiders and abettors under that statute and in

3

doing so, used the language that I quoted, the reasoning which

Certainly if the statute involved in

The

This Court struck

10

had been found not only in that opinion but in the ultimately

11

prevailing dissent of Mr. Justice Harlan in Poe versus Oilman (?)

12

and I think again that that is the central issue in Stanley,

13

that the state is invading ~ in the Stanley facts the state

14

is invading a completely private realm and here we are dealing

15

with public conduct and because it is public conduct, no matter

16

how carefully guarded it may be, there are at least some sorts

17

of materials which the state may prevent from appearing in the

!8

course of that conduct.

19

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

21
