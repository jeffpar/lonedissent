ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM TERRY BRAY, ESQ»

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR» BRAY;

a

Mr» Chief Justice and if it may

please the Courts
These combined income tax cases are here on

22
23
24
25

In each case a husband and wife

own one-half under the Louisiana law.

No Federal income tax

returns were filed by either spouse? either separately or
jointly.

The marriages were subsequently dissolved and the

Government separately assessed each wife for the income taxes
on her share of the realised unreported community income.
The cases present a single question; whether, when

18
19

They involve the Louisiana

no

returns have been filed, a Louisiana wife must report and

pay the Federal income taxes on the one-half share of community
income which under the laws of tha-t state, she owns,
In each of these cases the Fifth Circuit, held that
she need not do so where she neither accepts liability for
those taxes nor receives any benefits from the community pro­
perty before the dissolution of the community.
3

We believe that in doing so that Court failed

i

2

to perceive an important distinction, one which we feel under­

3

lies the decision in this case; that is the distinction of

4

imposition of the tax on the one hand and collection of the

S

tax from the individual owing it on ther other.
Q

6

Mr. Bray, could you tell me one detail;

7

is the income of -the community on which the deficiency was

8

determined due to the wife's earnings or inceno from her

9

pz*opert^ at all?
A

10

In the Mitchell case it

was partially

11

due to her earnings.

12

thatall of her community income was due to the husband’s

13

earnings.

14

due to the

15

we do not believe, since regardless of who generates the

18
17

In neither case was there any significant income
wife's individual separate efforts.

20

half interest of it from the very moment it comes into being.
Q

.23
24

25

This has to be your position necessarily.

It is rather reminiscent of the old embezzlement cases? isn't
it?
A

21
.22

This, however,

income, under Louisiana law, each spouse owns an undivided one-1

18
19

In the Angello case the record indicates

Yes, sir and even before that the split

income taxes in the 1930 time of this Court. We think those
cases decide

this case and compel the result for which w®

here contend.
Our position is thatthis case involves only the

4

%

imposition of the tax and that because the wife owns her share

&

of community income she is taxed on it,

9

that oi:.r position may result in hardships in certain instances

4

to wives residing in community property states# yet we think

3

the law is clear and compels the position that we take# at

6

least as the statutory law presently exists.

7

While we recognize

In sum# we argue that it is now and for, many

a

years prior to this# well-established that the Federal statutes

9

impose the tax against the owner of the income? that undertth®

10

Louisiana law the wife owns outright her one-half interest in

n

community income as of the very moment that it comes into

12

existence# and that it follows that she must report and pay

13

taxes on her half.

'14

On the other hand# as regards the collection of these

15

taxes# we think there is no real dispute on our position here.

16

The state laws exempting Louisiana wife from community obliga­

17

tions and we would here acknowledge that Federal income taxes

18

or community income are indeed# a community obligation but

19

these state laws exonerating the wife from community obliga­

20

tion simply are ineffective to the United States in its efforts

21

to collect the tax from the individual owing it.

22

The dispute here really is whether the wife®s

23

ownership of her community income# her share of community in­

24

come# is sufficientunder the Federal statutes# for that statute

25

to impose the tax against her and compel her to pay tax ©n it.

2

Q

Mr. Bray,, is that renunciation in the

Louisiana statute common to all community property states?

3

A

It was noti it was common under the

4

Spanish law.

5

can tell Louisiana is the only state which has carried this

6

over from the Spanish law.

7

that even under the Spanish law it was

B

the existence of the marriage the wife owned outright her half

9

of community income.

10

It arose under the

Spanish law.

As far as we

I might point out in that regard
very clear that during

The renunciation provision was merely

11

one designed to protect her from* community creditors again ,
7
a creditor right proposition which gave her the right upon the

12

termination of the marriage to forego

13

interest in the community income and for. that matter, all

14

community property, and severallyto be relieved of any obliga­

15

tions or community debts.
Q

16

17

Well, by termination of the marriage this

would include death of her spouse.
A

18
19

her otherwise vested

That's correct.

In fact, in these cases,

one dissolution occurred because of death.

20

Q

Does the husband have the same right?

21

A

No? the husband does not "and this is

22

because, again originating from the Spanish law, the husband

23

has the management, generally speaking of the community pro­

24

perty.

25

property he ought to be responsible for the community debts

It was therefore thought that because he manages the

6

1

regardless and indeed, historically not only was he responsible

2

in the sense that community property was responsible for the

3

debts, but he personally was responsible for those community

4

debts .

IS

In other words, if the community was not suf~

6

ficient to take care ©f the community debts, he had to come

7

out of his own separate property to pay those debts.

3
3

Q

— was there no way for the "master" to

pay?

10

A

Mo.

11

Q

Isn't that part of the provision?

12

A

Yes, sir, but I would point out that there

13

are conditions for the wife, while she can't compel her hus­

14

band to pay her tastes as such, yet she does have protections

15

under state law which ara very clearly spelled out, not only

16

to the state law cases# but for that matter in the two cases

17

in which this Court has dealt with Louisiana community property;

10

Bender versus Pfaff, the split income case and Fernandez

19

versus Wiener -- I beg your pardon, a state tax case, and in

£0

both instances, while the husband had management rights over

21

her half of the community property, nevertheless, she had some

22

rather special provisions of

23

interest in that state property» including 'the right to

24

separate her property from her husband's without terminating

25

the marriage and from -that point forward to have complete

that she could compel her husband to give her this information ,

9

Yes, sir; it does.
But, let me emphasise thiss that statute presently

10

applies only where a joint return has been filed and thus

11

both spouses are jointly and severally liable for the entire

12

tax.

13

Under existing law as we interpret it, the husband is not

14

liable for the taxes on the wife“s share of the community

15

income; thus only the wife —- thus we may presently only g©

16

after the wife.

17

relieve an innocent spouse in a community property state from

20

Congress would impose liability on the 'guilty spouse, with

zt

respect t© those taxes.

22

taxation under the present steta law.

Now, this highlights the problem ws’rs faced with here.

If, indeed similar legislation is presented to

23

Now —

24

Q

25

than we would hope that

Otherwise, half an income will escape

Mr. Bray, going back to Justice White's

question; isn't the same kind of dilemma presented to the
10

1

— to a member of a husband-wife team in a non-community

2

property state is there is an advantage in filing a joint

3

return and she ean9t find out what income he has?

4

A

Absolutely o

S

Q

It isn't the same because she could file

%

7

a separate return and avoid penalties directly.
A

That9s right, and let me say in that

8

regards while the present legislationhas relieved the wife of

9

liability in certain verylimited circumstances, there are two

10

very important features of thafcs first of all, the legislation,

11

we feel was absolutely necessary, notwithstanding some eases to

12

the contrary, to bring about the change in the law; that is

13

of relieving the wife of liability.

14

%

Secondly, X would point that again, historically

15

under Spanish law, the wife has not been deemed the one-half

16

owner of fraudulently obtained funds.

17

So that the situation to which the amending

18

statute is specifically < directed; that is where the husband

19

has fraudulently obtained funds and the wife has not been,

20

deemed the one-half owner of fraudulently-obtained funds.

21

that thus situation to which the amending statute is specif leal 1

22

directed, that is where the husband has fraudulently obtained

23

funds and the wife knows nothing about them, would not, under

24

the historical approach of the community property law, be a

25

problem in community property states, because the wife doesn't

11

So

i

own any part of that fraudulently-obtained income.

2

But s to answer your question as directly as I

3

can; yes; the situation would be identical in the common-law

4

states»

5

Q

In a common-law state where a joint

6

return is made and let's say there is another statement of

7

income that is negative or fraudulent or criminalc there are

3

more taxes owing, and that.Es discovered»

How, can each spouse

In the community property state?

11

Q

M©t noi in the common-law states.

12

A

If a joint, return has been filed and

13

signed; yes, until the amendments of the statute in January

14

©f this year.

15

Q

Each spouse can b@ held liable —

16

A

That6s right; jointly and severally .

17

liable for all taxes, both those reported and those found 'to

13

be du® upon subsequent —
Q

19

And, unlike, as I understand it, you told

20

us that community property state the spouse is only liable for

21

half

22

the taxes?
A

Absolutely.

Mow, I think again this

23

serves to highlight the problem here.

24

of our making, but rather one of the community property laws.

25

Historically the community property laws had provided •'
12

The problem is not one

1

community property husbands and wives with some rather sig­

2

nificant advantages.

3

and I might add that the joint return came into being essen-

4

fcially because of' the advantages,

5

Before in the day of the joint return,

before the day of the joint

return the spouses could split their income, file it separately

6

and thus avoid, or»at least lessen the impact of the graduating

7

income tax.

S
9

When this Court held in the 1930 term, upheld the
right of the spouses to do this, in the series of cases founded

1:0

on Pc© versus Seabron, advantages were very clear-cut and the

11

Court established at that time that taxation follows owner­

12

ship insofar as the individual taxpayer is concerned.

13

think that that compels the position that we take heres that

14

the wife owns her share and-she must pay- taxes on it.

15

16

. ■

We

Mid I might add, that since 1930 that has been the

whole basis ©f the taxation of individuals in the Federal
acorns

.ax Cod®.

That is, it has taxes the income of two

Hi

13

individuals, and this has been repeatedly recognised and -the

19

Congress has acted on this understanding of the law.

20

the recent amindmen&sserve to emphasis this once more.

21

those amendments, or rather the legislative history of if, the

22

Congressional Reports'indicate that except for the amendment

23

Congress'recognized that in the community property fetes the

24

wife would be deemed to be owner of one-half of all community

25

income and would have to report and pay tax on it.
13

Indeed,

Now, with respect to the state law we think it’s

dispute either with respect to the Respondents, or for that

5

matter, with respect tofche Fifth Circuit on this particular

6

topic»

7

Indeed, the Fifth Circuit said that in its opinion
present
that under Louisiana law the wife has a/vested ownership in­

8

terest in one-half of the community property, including its

9

income.

The Court could only say this following not only the

19

many decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court so stating, but

11

also the decisions of this Court in Bender versus Pfaff and in

12

Fernandes versus Wiener, so holding.
But the Court went on to say that it has rejected

13
14

what we say must follow.

That is, that the wife must report

15

and pay taxes on her half, by saying that, under Louisiana law

IS

the wife’s interest in the community is of such a character

17

that she» is not personally liable out of her separate property

18

for the tax ©n her share,

19

W® think in this regard the Court confused collec­

20

tion ©f the taxas which state law does provide protections that

21

would ordinarily protect the wife from community creditors and

imposition ©f the tax which we think is truly the issue her©

involved.

'i

Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Blaclsmun we

Z

can*t claim the equities in this case, and we recognize that

3

only too. welly but we come here because we think the law is

4

clear.

5
6
7

It has been for some 40 years now, ever since the

splitting temptations, and that law is that in the individual
tax area the individual who owes the income must report to pay
the ataxes on it.
Further, if we had a means of going after the

a
9

io

husband this might act be quite so much a concern to us, but.
under the existing state of the law, as I have explained, we
can't go after the husband.

ii
12
13

and the cases that have come along since it, make that very
clear.
Q

14
15

A
would.

18
19
20

Is it very likely that you would ever get

a case :Ln this area that was not a hardship case?

16

17

Again, we think the Malcolm case

Not on this subject; I don't believe it

But, I might point out that of course the wife, as I

mentioned earlier, realises some rather significant benefits
under the community property laws which she doesn't have under
the common law states.

Those benefits war© before the Court in

the split income cases.
21

-

And this is merely the other side of the coin from

22
state law.

Now, of course the state can change its laws, just

23
as Congress could amend the revenue statutes with respect to
24
these specific hardship areas. Indeed, my understanding ©f
25
23

!

Californici law is that if the husband abandons the wife the

2

income which he subsequently owes which is his separate income,

3

and the wife has no interest, no ownership interest in that,

4

then thus would not be obligated to report and pay taxes on it.

5

There is nothing to preclude, I presume, Louisiana from doing

6

t!ie same, and that s truly the hardship case, I think, more so

7

than ours, where the wife was residing with her husband and

9

indeed in all probability, sharing with him whatever earnings
he had*

In today s world the wife does, indeed, spend quite

10

a bit of the income which I think even her husband makes, and

II

I think it5s realistic to recognize that»
But, in the area where Mr» Justice White posited,

12

13

where she has no knowledge of what is going on and can't bec&usi

14

her husband has abandoned her, for instance, then there is

15

nothing to suggest why Louisiana couldn't modify its laws to

16

say in itfiat circumstance the husband owns outright his income

17

and the wife has no interest in it»

A

As you can see, there is--no-

Q

Gan the same thing' be said of the embezzle­

ment cases in, I think, Jones, under the holding of this Court?

Except, as 1 tried to say, in the embezzle­

23

ment arts, historically at any rate, the community property

24

law has not recognized the wife as the one-ttaA? owner ©£ monies

23

illegally -obtained by her husband.

25

Thus, we would not be faced

t

with, I don31 think? in the community property, quite the same

2

problem in theembezzlement cases.

3

Now, I might add that it is for this very reason

4

that Congress saw fit to amend the provisions of the Internal

5

Revenue Code this January to relieve the wife of this liability

6

.in this hardship case.

7

Q

there again confirmed its understanding that income is taxes

is the owner and thus is the taxpayer for her share.

of course, would have no objection whatsoever to the Congress

18

doing the same for hardship cases in community property states

17

ifhere no return was filed if they also devise, if Congress can

18

also devise a means for imposing liability against the husband

19

in that circumstance.

that the husband is primarily liable on community obligations.

Very well, Mr. Bray.

MR. KIRKPATRICKS Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
This Court has said that individuals who have

13

command over income may be taxed on that income even though

14

they do not have title to it.

15

the Respondent, Mrs. Ann Goyne Mitchell, cannot be taxed on

13

income, community income which it has said she owns, but over

17

which she has no command.

18

We ask this Court to hold that

We ask tills, because to interpret Section I of the

19

Code, which taxes income of individuals as imposing a tax on

20

her would make it unconstitutional as applied to her.

21

And secondly, irrespective of 'the constitutional

22

argument and the issue in Section 1, Section 1 should, not be

23

interpreted as imposing a fax on her because her vested interes

in the community is insufficient to cause her to be required

to treat the income of that community as her own income.

that it is not her income.

That Section 1 of the.Code when it

24

imposes a tax on the income of individuals, does not impose a

25

fcass on the wife.

35

t

Now, the argument goes that since she has a

a

vested interest in the community she owns the community’s

3

income, but this ignores a basic fundamental concept of the

4

community property laws»

5

munity :1s not a form of co-ownership ~ co-tenancy.

6

property is the property of the community; it is not owned one-

7

half by one and one-half by the other.

8

— the community is separate from the husband and the wife.

9

The tax problem arises from the fact that the community is not

10

a taxpaying entity and in order to find an individual or indi­

11

viduals who will pay its tax the community then must ba

12

attributable to some person.

The question then is really and truly is not whose

15

Po© v. Seaborn did not — which held that the husband and wife

19

that it could not be said that on© owned it any more than the

22

Because Seaborn said she

Mitchell does not conflict with Seaborn unless the

14
15

import ©f Seaborn was that the husband could only be required

16

to pay on one-half or that the wife was-liable for one-half of

17

the tax on her separate property without regard to anything

18

else.

19

If -that is what Seaborn meant, although it did not

20

say that, we suggest that this Court should overrule Seaborn

21

because that is an illogical interpretation, ©f Section 1.

22

creates an unnecessary problem with state law and it causes

23

collection problems that the Government complains ©£ here.

It is unnecessary for this Court to overrule

No, Your Honor, that the rationale of

If I may sum up for just a moment, the essence of

©ur argument is that the only reason that anyone has -suggested

Now, what X

What X say the law is that —* is that Federal

And I say that in that omission by the Government

3

of a look at what is the right of the wife to renounce the

5

error in this case.

6

Under Louisiana community property law it is true

7

that the wife has a present vested interest in the property.

3

However , that law says that she has a right to renounce the

9

community and under our holdings of our Supreme Court it is as

though' the corsaunity never existed as far as she was concerned,

11

Now, the reasons for these, of course, have al­

12

ready bsen touched upon by my colleague, Mr. Kirkpatrick in

13

talking about the almost unlimited control that the husband

14

has over the community property.

15

a question by the Chief Justice *— the question was:

16

husband alienate the homestead?"

17

is "yes,"

18

For instance, in answer to
"Can the

The answer to that question

Now, there is a provision in the state law which

19

gives the right to the wife to file a declaration of homestead

20

and prevent, the husband from doing so.

2.1

tsssercised and if the ownership or title of the property is

22

taken in the name of the husband alone even though it is the

23

24

band is free fe© alienate that property and he cannot be for­

25

bidden by the wife from doing so or he cannot be called upon to
53

This is not usually

I

account to the wife after he has done it

%

So, I say to the Court that because of this great

s

power cf control and because of the very effects that would

4

flow from the hypothetical which we have inserted in our brief

5

which I think is a good analysis and a sound analysis ©r an

6

analogy ~ excuse me ~ 1 think the Government has admitted

7

that the effect of their position would b© that where the bus-

8

band earns this money, squanders it they can com© bask to the

9

wife to pay on half the income that she never saw, naver con­

10

trolled, never enjoyed and could not do anything about it.
Q

II

Would you say that the Government could

12

collect the entire bill for theentlre tax bill for 'the entire

13

community from the husband?

14

A

I think that the logical extension of the

15

Louisiana community property law if it is left undisturbed in

16

this case is that the husband owes all of the community income

17

tax because a husband under Louisiana law does not have that

IS

same right as the wife has.

19

Q

Does this require any modification of prio:

A

Mo, I So not believe it would, sir.

20
21

cases?
Mr.

22

Justice White, I think the only prior cases that the Government

23

relies upon, being Seaborn and Bender, are cases that stand

24

only for the proposition that if the wife -chooses to file

25

a joint return or separate return —* split income in other

54

words she has enough; a sufficient vested interest in the

community to do so.
The Government would have you extend that to mean

In fact. Your Honor

I was going to add that the Malcolm situation and the thought
that I was trying to make here in answer to Mr® Justice

21

Stewart's question was this: that under Louisiana lav if a

22

husband and wife both sign that same note in a finance company

23

~ in other words, the wife has not# joined in signing- that

24

note ®

25

Under Louisiana law she has voluntarily then

56

I

obligated herself personally to pay the debt so that then her

2

separate property can be reached.

3

husband can actually endanger the community, all of the wife's

4

interest in the community when he signs that note and it's

3

under that condition that we say that the law has provided for

6

the wife to renounce.

But the point is that the

7

And Your Honors9 the only other point I wanted to

8

make t© the Court is that the Government's characterisation of

9

what 1 have called the wife's separate property's immunity,, if

10

you will, from vulnerability t® seizure by the Government for

IS

tax purposes — that has been characterised by the Government

12

as a state exemption statute the way you would exempt, for

13

instance, insurance proceeds under law or the way you might

14

exempt the tools of trad® from seizure; that type of thing*
Your Honors, I think that that is almost a crass

15

16

characterization.

17

property system which flows logically from the others that sines

18

the wife can renounce and since she doesn't have control,

19

therefore her separate property cannot be seised by a community

20

creditor.

21

This is an integral part of our community

And I say to the Court that that is not merely an

22

exemption statute that the Federal law preempts? more than

23

that it is an integral part of our community property system

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM TERRY BRAY, ESQ.

7

ON BEHAIsF OF PETITIONERS

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Schott.

MR. BRAY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would like

to respond to four or five items brought out. in the argument.

10

First, it's our position that the Federal statute

11

at tills point in time is very clear that it taxes income t©

12

the owner, and that this has been the law since this Court

13

handed down its decision in the 1930 term in the split income

14

cases.
Thus, the inquiry under state law is: who Is the

15

IS

owner, and we think the law of Louisiana is equally clear,

17

•that the wife owns her one-half share of the income and thus

18

it follows that she must report and pay the taxes on it.
The taxpayers9 arguments essentially are that the

19

refer so qualify &

20

various state law rights to which they

21

wife's ownership that she can't he obligated to pay the tax,

22

but the ownership does not rise to the-'level which the Federal

23

statutes tax.

24

verbatim the Government's brief in the Poe versus Seaborn cases

25

All of these arguments were made by the Government, in the 1930

Listening to that argument it duplicates almost

60

i

cases in support of 'their position that the husband must report

2

and pay taxes on all of the community income,

3

that he was 'the in fact, owner of-all the income because of

4

his practical powers, management powers, albeit, over that

3i

income.

3

W® argued there

And, of course, not only did we argue hi3 manage­

7

ment powers, but we also accorded to the wife's protections

8

under state law, sp@cifica.lly her renunciation power and we

9

argued in our brief that this renunciation power was incon­

10

sistent with the wife being © "sufficient owner” to entitle hes

11

separately to report and pay taxes.

12

notwithstanding our arguments the Courts very

13

clearly held, and this contrary to assertions ©f Respondents,

14

that the income is taxed fee the owner.

15

the community, but rather t© the owner and found that the indi­

16

vidual spouses, each of them owned their respective shares of

17

the community income.

18

It did not tax it to

This was the very holding, not only in Poe versus

19

Seaborn, the Washington case, but also in the Louisiana case

20

where the Court said: "If the test be as we have held it is3

21

ownership, then the Louisiana case is probably the strongest of

22

those presented to us in favor of the wife's ownership of one-

23

half ©f that income,”

24
25

Xfe went on, of course, to hold that because she
was the owner she was entitled separately to report and pay

61

1

z

taxes on it.
The wife, indeed, has protection under state law

3

but the;?© protections do not affect her basic ownership rights.

4

They are outlined in the Wiener opinion to which we refer on

S

page 10 of our brief, in support of the Court5s decision there,

6

the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision there, showing that the

7

husband3 a management powers are not so extensive as to destroy

8

the wife's ownership.

9

husband's powers.

These protections, indeed, limit the

The husband not only has these rights with

10

respect to management, but has the duty to manage the community

11

property to the benefit of the community.

12

So that these go along with the rights.

13

1 might add that the provision of Louisiana law

14

dealing with separation of property without dissolving the

15

marriage provide not only for tfo© separation a* property where

16

the wife's ~ beg your pardon, where the husband's activities

17

endanger the wife's separate property, but go on to says "al­

18

though this order ©f his affairs induces her to believe that

19

hisestate may not foe sufficient, to meet her rights and claims.85

20

And ©f course it's our position that one of her

21

rights and claims would be to — the right fc© receive her share

22

of community property upon dissolution of the community and

23

thus if the husband was frittering away the community income

24

obviously this would entitle her t© a separation of property

25

under Louisiana Civil'Code.

62

With respect to the right of renuncation, let me

f

say that this, of course occurs only after'the community is
s

dissolved and as in the cases here, long .after the tax years

4

in which income is realized and this is the clear law of

5

Louisianas the wife owns her share of that income.

10
