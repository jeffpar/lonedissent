ORAL ARGUMENT BY ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS (CONTINUED)

MR. CO I s

11

Mr» COX, you may

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
I suggested yesterday that our submission that
Article XXXIV violates the Equal Protection Clause of 'the 14th
Amendment, could conveniently b® approached in four steps.
The first, which .1 have covered, was to show that

12

the indisputable purpose and effect of Article XXXIV is to

13

erect an obstacle in the path of the poor when they seek

14

governmental action t© supply their need for housing. It does

15

not concern any other group seeking governmental action to

16

satisfy its demands on the political system,

17

provisions for the automatic referendum cannot be explained by

18

the consistent application of any neutral or general principle.

19

tod that the

Our second main point is to emphasis® that

20

Article XXXIV builds its unique bias into the very structure of

21

the political system, into the very cor© ©f government itself.

22

1 strass that point, although it's obvious, for this reason?

23

it is quite clear that in working out substantive policies

24

lines must b© drawn by governments and sometimes those lines

25

are very difficult ones, as in Dandridge and Williams.

26

i

ItBs also clear that substantive policies when

Z

developed by government sometimes operate more harshly against

3

one class tjhan against another.

4

much-publicized iitigafcior e though hot in this Courts attacking

5

zoning laws on the ground that they fence the poor out of the

6

communities.

7

An esc ampla is the currently

Th© point 18ia trying to make is that we are not

3

asking the Court to render a decision that has any impact upon

9

those kinds of persons.

Here the bias is in the way decisions

10

are reached by the political community and ife seems to

11

that not only narrows the issue but that it makes the dis­

12

crimination a great deal more wrong.

13

like discrimination in voting or in apportionment or even in

14

th© way one stands bafor® the courts.

15

Q

16

this was racially motivated?

17

A

us 'that

Xtes a discrimination

Is there any evidence in this case that

I don't think one can say that there is any

18

proof that the thinking ©£ 'those who voted to put this into

10

the constitution was ~ that there was any proof that it was

20

racially motivated, but we d© kp.ow that in its operations since

21

it bears upon the poor it bears more harshly upon minorities

22

than it does on any other group.

23

th,® area of housing.

24

little bit before th® two arguments are over.

25

That's particularly true in

I do intend to develop that point a

Bute I think that this being a discrimination

i

b uilt into the political system that the case comes within

z

what we said in Hunter and Erickson.

3

disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult

4

to enact legislation in its behalf -than it may dilute any

5

person's vote or give any group a smaller representation than

8

others ©£ comparable sise.

7

The state may no more

The third main point 1 would wish to emphasis®

8

is that on. -the face of this statute it singles out for separate

9

classification» the poor* ©r in the words of the statutes

10

“Parsons of law income.”

11

as persons ©r families who lack the amount of income which is

12

necessary to enable them to live in decant* safe and sanitary

13

dwellings without overcrowding.

14

And persons of low income are defined

Again* I think the explicit singling out of

15

persons ©£ low income narrows the issue that is here.

10

narrows it in several senses.

17

be no doubt about the group against whom the discrimination

18

runs.

19

It

In the first place there could

Second* this is not in any amm® a shifting group.

20

The poor are identifiable and unfortunately* to© constant* to©

21

coherent a group in a sense.

Rhodes* where arguably the group cam® together for one purpose

23

and then broke up later; or like Westbrook and Mibaley* the

24

California case dealing with the two-thirds majority required

25

for a bond issue* where one could say . that the group was
28

It’s not like Williams and

1

temporary.

2

Here it is a continuing group* a group who* our

3

experience tells us* are particularly subject to prejudice*

4

invidious discriminations in the area ©£ housing»
This brings the case* we think* within the

5
6

principles that this Court has often noted.

7

McDonald against Board ©£ Election Commission.

8

observed that the discrimination against the poor was enough

9

to render a classification highly suspect and thereby demand a

1©

For example* in
The Court

more exacting judicial scrutiny.
And* in Mr. Justice Harlan2s dissenting opinion

11
12

in Griffin and Illinois he noted: t8The states of course ©re

13

prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause from discriminating

14

between rich and poor as such* in the formulating and applica-»

15

tion of their laws."

IS

cisely -that.

17

And this statute* we submit* does pre­

In other words* to summarise what I have said thus

18

far; th® combination of' an explicit separate classification of

19

the poor* With disadvantage in the very processes by which

20

governmental decisions are reached* and

21

consistent application ©£ any neutral or general principle.

22

We think if it is not enough to condemn the statute out of

23

hand* it is certainly enough to put upon the state a very

24

heavy burden of justification.

25

unexplained by th®

And I turn now* therefore* fc© th® justification®

29

i

which X understand t© have been offered,, and they fall into

2

three groups.
The first group might be said to b© political?

3
4

that is it has to do with the organisation of government.

And

S

it said first that the interest in popular self-rule or popular

6

sovereignty explains the line which California has drawn here.

7

But# the difficulty is that while there is# of course# an

3

interest in popular*»type government# that interest does not

9

explain the line that California has drawn# the discrimination

10

it has made.

11

automatic referendum# in which there is exactly the same in­

12

terest in popular self-government and indeed# in this respect

13

the case is no different from Hunter and Erickson.
It said

21

22
23
24
25

There are other items that do not. require this

that Article XXXIV is a result of a

hole that developed in Article IV, Section 1 of the California
constitution.

But, if Article XXXIV was a reaction# it was an

overreaction# and it8s the "over"-part of it# if I may put it
colloquially# that we say discriminates and of which wa cornplain.
Q

Mr. Cox* I don9t recall whether yesterday

you treated the question#' the problem ©f 'the community9s right
to pass on what ©mounts to a discrimination in taxing ©f these
projects? that is this project will not pay it® fair share ©f
tax in the minds and eyes of the small homeowner.

How# isn't

that an important interest# to deserve protection# the

3©

1

protection of a referendum?

2

A

There is such an interest and these --

3

there, will be lass contribution by the government because it*s

4

limited to ten percent of the shelter rents on these projects,

S

than there might be collected if the full value ©f the project

6

was taxed as if it was privafcly owned.
But, there are many instances? Mr, Chief Justice?

7
8

in California where projects are undertaken; seme by the govern

9

ment, some by charities and other: private institutions? where

10

landed buildings equally ©re taken off the tax rolls? and they

11

are not subject t© the referendum,
Q

12
13

But those are quite different categorias,

A Federal Government building obviously —

I was

17

are taken off of the tax rolls, just like this,

thinking

Q

of

wasn't thinking of a government building;

a

school or an

airport or a university?

Arenat they distinguishable in that they

serve everyone?
A

Well, 1 think that to a degree? and .of: ■;;

21

course this is what the Court has said in upholding public

22

housing, that public housing serves everyone,

23

I would submit that this case in this respect, is

24

very like Shapiro and Thompson; that there is «a interest that

25

the people have in asserting fiscal control.
31

But that that

1

interest does not justify discriminating on invidious grounds»

z

against a particular class.

3

than here^ hut Mr .Justice BrennanBs

4

It may legitimately attempt to limit its expenditures; or I

S

would say; to taka things off the tax rolls; whether' for public

6

assistance* public education or any other programs.

7

state may not accomplish such a purpose by invidious distinc­

8

tions between classes of its citizens.

There it was a different class
opinion was very explicit.

But, the

9

And I think to say while we are going to be con­

io

cerned about public expenditures and handle these differently

ii

where the benefit the poor, but we are not going to concern

12

them where the primary benefit is those who use an airpott,

13

•those who use a superhighway, those who want, to go to school or

14

those who want a hospital, is an invidious discrimination.

33

0

X suppose it would follow from your thesis

16

thgit a state could not submit to popular referendum the

17

question of welfare programs and welfare recipients?

18

definition they are only for the poor.

19

A

By

Well, I would say if the only thing sub­

29

mitted to popular referendum on & continuing basis and it was

21

a form of public assistance, that that would b@ subject to an

22

argument very similar to ours hare? yes.

23

it is singling out a particular class and sayings "It is your

24

claims," if I may use the word in the S&qsq sms®, against

23

government —"you don31 stand the way anyone else does."

32

But again, I think

You

just as offensive as the brand of race in other cases.

And it does seem to m©

It.puts a brand

Now, there is one other set of justifications

7
8

offered and those have been labeled "sociological and environ-

©

mental."

Mr. Atkinson yesterday raised the specter of large

I©

block public housing that goes in in places like St. Louis.

11

We had one, unhappily, in Cambridge.

12

the rationale, then Article XXXIV is both too broad and too

13

narrow.

14

tothat kind of project.

IS

similar to -those built by private ownership.

IS

That just ~ if that is

It's too broad because public housing is not confined
It involves small housing units very

Indeed, there is

,
*•
no hotter illustration than the one in this record that was
t

17

voted down by referendum because the proposal was to build not

13

mar® than 1,000 dwelling units? not more than four such dwell­

19

ing units situated in any one structure mid I just finished

20

reading this point.

21

Not nor® than one structure containing any such

22

dwelling unit shall be situated ©n any one lot — this is

23

record 29 ~ and such dwelling units shall b® dispersed among

24

various sections of the city so that not more than 24 such

25

dwelling units — that would be not more than ~ six structures

33

1

at the most; you see -- shall be situated within a radium of

2

1500 feet from any other such dwelling unit.

3

So that what is put to referendum here is a far

4

broader class ©f things ~ is too broad and that kind of

3

thing as to which the rationality is supposed to apply.

6

Similarly^ not everything to which the rationale might apply

7

is put to referendum.
But? I say; Mr. Chief Justice, with the form of

8
9

referendum that I just referred to, suggests the answer to the

10

question you raised yesterday about how would you put 'the

11

question affirmatively to the voters, because it does describe

12

in sufficient terms the kind of project that might b© put to

13

them to require embarking on the project.
Q

14

May I ask you just on© questions I didn’t

15

quite understand your answer to the Chief Justice.

16

California were to submit to the people a referendum to vote

17

on whether or not there would any longer be used in the state

18

a system ©f public relief payable out of tax raised funds.
Did 1 understand you to say that would be uncon­

19

20
21

Suppose

stitutional?
A

I think a continuing rule requiring that

22

appropriations for public relief be submitted to referendum

23

when nothing els© is submitted to referendum, would b® dis­

24

crimination against the poor and a violation of the Equal

25

Protection Clause? yes.

What’s fair and right?
I think if the people, as we do where I

live, determine our policies in town meetings with everyone

attending, I don’t think this Court could say that that is un­

7

Hasn't the State of California had, in effect, a town

A

Well, I'm trying to distinguish — perhaps

I have become confused — I ’m trying to distinguish between a

10

decision of substantive policy there should be no housing or

n

there should be no relief, which seems fco me to be one question.

12

And a decision which builds a disadvantage into the way sub­

13

stantive policies are mad®, which I say under Hunter and

14

Erickson,is like weighting votes or denying ■ the vote to a

15

particular class.

16

And 1 think this is of the utmost importance,

17

because saying to a class of people that they don't — and

18

particularly to a class of people subject to invidious dis­

19

crimination, if they don't stand like other people the decision:;!

20

affecting 'them ought fc© be made by the same processes as the

21

decisions affecting other people,is particularly offensive fco

Do you distinguish in this respect between

constitutional limitations and legislative actions which would

eliminate some type ©f welfare program or subsidy for housing?

Well? I don't think if California were to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD C. ATKINSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

13

19

MR. ATKINSON:

20

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts

21

I think Mr. Cox5s argument her® has revealed a

22
23
24

25

number ©£ things.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I believe really what he's saying is that

California would have to submit everything to a prior automatic

referendum for them to be able to employ, a prior automatic
referendum anywhere.

And I don't believe"that there are any

38

1

cases that ha can cite that would indicate that that’s the

z

rule at the present time.

3

in Hunter, Mr. Justice White.

And 1 don't think that was the rule

Hunter was dealing with a situation where there

4

5

was no referendum — pardon me — %?here there was a referendum

6

right.

7

it and the only possible reason for that as the Court indica-”

8

ted,, was t© discriminate.

9

also? the court so states.

And there was another referendum right built on top of

0

10

There you have racial classification

Yes* but the discrimination amounted to

n

subjecting one type of subject matter to an automatic .referen­

12

dum y whereas the general referendum required a petition.

13

in California you have a general referendum law by petition?

14
15

16

18

22

25

That’s correct.

Q

Except that thisadministration that

U

19

A

Here

That’s right.

Q

And so California,

in fillingth© void,

said: "Well, wa won’t subject this administrative action until

ject to, but w@ will subject it to an automatic referendum;
right?
h

X would disagree to this ©sstent —

Well, isn't that true?

in California where prior automatic referendum ~
Q

Oh, I knew, but your general referendum

4

A

Yes, for state and local bodies? yes.

5

Q

Yes , yes? and here you subjected the

6

administrative action to an automatic referendum.

7

far Xe® right?

8

A

Yes.

9

Q

And there may

That's so

be some other automatic

10

referenda areas tout — and they might be as suspect as this one,

11

for all I know.

12

A

I think that you are very well raising a

13

specter which the Court than may b© faced with if you decide

14

here that XXXIV is unconstitutional I think you are going to

15

hav® a rash of cases attempting to lay out the general prin­

16

cipi® that the state has to act totally across-the-board in any

17

area in which it wishes t© act.
Q

Well, we already have one, so —

A

In any ©vent,

it seems fco tm that what

really is involved here is the voting rights of the majority.
Does the majority of a state have the right in a purely internal
matter, to make a decision as fc© whether or not they want to
have something fco which the people don't have a constitutional
or fundamental right.
As far as I know, no case so far has decided that
40

i

low-rent housing is a constitutional ©r fundamental right in

z

which the state cannot intrude in any way»

Mr, Cox cites the Shapiro case.

I don't think that acase is relevant at all, and 1 really think

21

w© would have to get back to this proposition: doejs a state

hav® th® right to deal with the poor one step at a time?

23

does it; have to deal with the poor totally across the board in

24

every area?

25

So,

Or

What California has done here is attempt to deal

with one area relating to the poor.

It treated it on a piece­

area.

be treated exactly the same as long as everything within the

class is treated the same.

How, as far as I know the cases on equal protection are

7

How, here you have the class treated exactly the

8

same? the record is tinsqui vocal? there is a stipulation in the

9

appendix which the Court can read that there are no other

10

publicly owned low-cost housing projects in California except

11

the type that appears within the confines of Article XXXIV»

So that what vie®re dealing with is a self-contain©a

classification rationally founded because of the gap in the

14

constitutional provisions relating to referenda in California.

17

A

I'm not sure I understand your question.

18

Q

Well, I mean, don't you think the 14th

Amendment requires a comparison of treatment not- only within

20

the class but between classes?

2!

A

Yes, I do.

I wouldhhave vary, very

22

much difficulty in understanding what is the other class and

23
24

perhaps Mr. Lasky will g© into that a bit, but if we're indif ■
sating 'that fch© other class is all projects that are Federally

projects# some of which there is no light of referendum? in

fact# almost without exception there is one type or another#

involving all different types of money? involving all different

types of projects# then it seem© to me that what the court

5

would b© doing by striking down XXXXV would be intruding ifc3

6

own judgment as far as reasonable minds could disagree as to

7

whether or not these types of projects are different and to

3

whether or not there ar© rational differences between them.

If the Court says? "No? we as nine wise men her© sit and we5re

have to be treated 'the same# theft I believe that’s what the
