OEMs ARGUMENT BY ROBERT R. LAVERCOMBE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

We will hear arguments

MR. LAVERCOMBEs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts

11

This appeal concerns a Cincinnati ordinance, which

12

is called a loitering ordinance, but this is really an unlawful

13

assembly®3type piece of legislation.

14

The ordinance provides that when in the company

15

of two or more other people one so conducts himself as to annoy

16

persons passing by, a crime is committed unless that combat

17

takes place at a public meeting of citizens, in which case it

18

is not a crime.

19

Hamilton County, Ohio includes Cincinnati and a

20

number of other municipalities and several of them have also

21

had ordinances using similar language.

22

Pleas Court £©r Hamilton County which has county “-wide jurisdic­

23

tion, held that the language used made the legislation un­

24

constitutional.

25

conclusion through the years and in 1968 the Appeals Court for

In 1940 the Common

All over Ohio the courts reached the same

2

1

the Cleveland area wrote in detail at length? and with emphasis?

2

how the ascertainable standards made the annoyance test in the

3

Cleveland ordinance cause it to represent an unconstitutional

4

exercise of the police power and it was therefore void for

5

vagueness.

6

That ©pinion is quoted at pages 5 and 6 in our

7

jurisdictional statement»

8

who? in 1970 wrote so strongly to the opposite effect in a

9

4 to 3 decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in this case of

10
11

It was written by the same judge

Coates versus Cincinnati.
At least between 1940 and 1968 the annoyance test

12

was considered to b® void for vagueness; indeed? the 1962

13

Supreme Court of Ohio held -that a dog barking ordinance which

14

used the annoyance test was void for vagueness»

IS

during the summer? Cincinnati? along with many other areas? had

16

racial disturbances and the police and perhaps more signifi­

17

cantly? all city officials frequently found themselves irrita­

?8

conduct so the officials and the police who were beset by

But? in 1967?

And members of the city government? including

annoyance which Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in the 7th
Edition? defines as? "a wearing oh the nerves by persistent
petty unpleasantness.

They arrested those who provoked them

3

1

and hauled them away and that, ended the annoyance for a very

2

short time,

making annoyance a crime directly results in contempt for our

system of law and order.

So we don't know what conduct the Appellants

were found guilty of?

A

That is correct»

2

Q

And wouldn't you suggest that there are some

3

facts in the world that anybody would realise might b©

4

covered by this statute or really is covered by the statute?
A

5

I certainly do, but I maintain this statute

6

is so broad and 1 have attempted to cite the cases that

7

illustrated that* the decisions of this Court»

3

that that "annoyance" is so broad that even though there may

9

fos factual circumstances which could properly bs used for a

Q

12

It’s too

On the other hand —

What if your clients were guilty of pre­

13

cisely that conduct which any fool would know would violate

14

the statute?
A

15

If I understand you correctly* then they

18

should have been charged with it* whether it be obscene dis­

17

course or disorderly conduct or assault and battery or -Q

18

Well* they were charged under the statute

19

and let's assume the evidence at the trial showed conduct

20

which anybody would know was covered by this statute*

21

couldn’t he much doubt about it.

There

22

A

I would have to disagree* Your Honor ~

23

Q

Well* I didn't —

24

A

I don’t see how anybody can define what

.

25

annoyance is.

I am sure you and I *-“•

5

Q

1

a

So your answer really is because nothing,

no conduct that you could think of that would be annoying?
A

3

I think we have to apply a certain degree of

reason and I am sure that you and I or anyone in this room

3

could designate certain conduct as annoying»

Q

Well, 1 agree, but that conduct may have

violated some other statutes, but the question is whether it
violated this one.
A

Right.

Q

And that conduct you concede anybody would

say it was annoying.
A

Right.

Q

And s© there wouldn’t be any doubt in the

minds of someone engaging in that conduct that it was the kind
of conduct that was clearly proscribed by this statute?
A

Eight.

1 agree with that, but I say that

that does not, of itself •»- granting what Your Honor says ~
Q

But that ~ go ahead.
6

1

A

Granting what Your Honor says, 1 submit it’s

E

too dangerous to allow that broad, general characterisation of

3

conduct to be a tool in the hands, if you will, of the lazy

4

policeman —

S

Q

Well, that’s different.

I understand that

8

argument.

7/

if this defendant knew precisely and had plenty of notice that

8

his conduct was covered by this statute, nevertheless, the

9

contours of annoyance are so vague or general that the statute

What you are really saying is that even if, even

10

should be stricken down and the state should not even be able

1!

to prosecute under this statute': those people whose conduct is

12

clearly covered by it?
A

13

I think that I would agree completely with

i4

what you just said.

IS

of decisions of this Court over the years which go in two

16

different areas; one is the area that you have just alluded

'n

And in that connection there are a number

to and the other is the area that it is a permissible interpre­

m

tation.

And those cases are fax* snore sophisticated than the

19

argument I9m attempting to present here.

Well, why doesn’t the record have -the facts

I find that & very difficult question which

I have been anticipating for some months.

The Supreme Court's opinion, the majority of

the four-judge decision, complains, 1 would say, rather

17

bitterly. Your Honor, about that.

18

The dissenting opinion says -they don't need any

20

a four-to-fchree decision there.

none of this is on the record and we didn8t intend it to be on

And

But on the assumption there was a plain

19

obstruction of traffic and they were charged and convicted

Yes, yes.

All right

with you.

I don't -— 2 just don’t agree

I think the ordinance is so vague, as I have al­

Q

You don't have to ~ you certainly don't

14

lose your ease just because you say or concede, even if you

15

would, that blocking traffic is an annoyance and any fool

16

would know it,

17

A

Well, I thought you were approaching if on

18

a more broad basis.

19

Let's agree that some set of circumstances is annoyance and

20

anybody will agree to that.

21

Q

22
23
24
25

7, understood you to say Banything.”

Well, then tell me why can't a man who en­

gages in that conduct be convicted under this statute
A

Because fee knows that a particular policeman

or a particular police court judge is going t© decide ~
Q

In some other case

12

I

A

Yes

,

Q

Not this one»

3

A

Since you and i have already stipulated that

2

4

these fasts areso atrocious that everybody would be annoyed, 1

5

would have to say yes; right*

6

Q

So, it's in some other cases.

7

A

Yes* sir.

8

Q

And that’s enough as it were that you think

9

the ordinance should be stricken down on its face?
A

10

Right; and 1 think I cited precedents for

that in this Court’s opinions.

n

Q

12

What is different about the situation you

13

just alluded to; that is what some policeman evaluates at a

14

particular time in this context, and a policeman who stops a

15

person for speeding and it*s his ©pinion or the version of the

m

speed against the driver’s; ©r he arrests him for weaving in

17

traffic and changing lanes.

18

any difference ©a this key thing that he emphasised., mainly

19

that he comes down to what annoys a policeman and why is that

20

any different from what a policeman is weaving in traffic ©r

21

speeding?

22

Is there anything -« is there

Surely* because what annoys a policeman is not

23

susceptible to ‘the sam© definitionfor all policemen; but when

24

the speed in traffic is 35 miles an hour or 38 miles an hour,

-

25

that is susceptible to be ©n exact definition, and weaving, I
13

submit to yon is virtually the same —

i

Q

2

Quit® true? the definition; but I am talking

3

about the evaluation process 'that leads the policeman to make

4

the arrest and almost invariably then in turn? leads to a

5

conviction because there are only two witnesses s the driver arid

6

the policeman.
Now? doesn’t all -this in any area come down to a

7

a

very large amount ©f judgment on the part of the arresting

9

officer?
A

10

1 believe e© and I think I have to answer you

n

by sayings we have to look to our courts to tell us; there has

12

got to be a dividing line somewhere and that’s what we’re

13

here for is for you to decide whether tills is on on© side ©r

14

the other of the dividing line.
1 am urging that annoyance is too far? to© far

13
16

from the center or to© far from a clearly-definable dividing

17

line within the context of the attempt I’m making to answer
our question.

13

I think annoyance is just too vague and 1 have

19

attempted feo cite some authorities to that effect.

20

Q

2!

Would you agree or not? that in shaping

22

ordinances of this kind? this general area of behavior which

23

can’t be precisely defined? if the public authority? the

24

legislative body is trying to make an accommodation between

25

having conduct which is identified as subject to a penalty in

-

14

3

order to prevent the victims , in this case the persons annoyed

Z

©r upset* or aggravated, from taking the law into their own

3

hands and engaging in a street riot to respond.
A

4
5

I think that would be the broad purpose of

the legislature to do that} yes, sir.
Q

6

It's better for a ptsblic authority’ to make

1

that decision than to let, Jet us say for example, a group of

8

working men on the one hand, or students on the other, annoy

9

and aggravate each other.

A

to
11

Q

16
17
13
19
20

2i
22
23
24
25

Well, then you don't agree with the basic

principle that this isi^a-saatter of accommodation and balance?
A

14
15

Xt3s

not appropriate —

12
13

How, 15m leaving you now, Your Honor.

I'm very strongly in favor, both emotionally

and in this case, with the principle of accommodation and
balance•

I do not think that this test is, this annoyance

test, is properly within a good will application of that con­
cept, for want ©f a well-thought-out phrase.
I don't think the legislature can, ©r the courts
should approve an attempt to accommodate that leaves that
much up t© guesswork.

Whowcmld know in advance — Mr. Justice

Whit© was asking me about this atrocious ©vent. ' Well, for a
minute let's get away from this atrocious event. ’Let's get t©
one feat's almost as atrocious.
How, who knows in advance when he's going down the

15

1

street whether if you are a policeman whether yon are going to

2

find that annoying whereas; a different policeman who had a

3

different set of circumstances when he left home that morning

4

or a different degree of comfort, «would be equally annoyed 0

5

Th&.tzs the area that I perceive is in danger here.

6

doing that# you see# that leads me to what is one of -the most

7

important points here.
That leads me to what I concede to be this con™

8
9

And by

tempt

this thing
Q

10

Well, suppos® some people deliberately

ii

blocked traffic# would there be any doubt that they deliberately

12

were doing an act that was annoying to the people in those

13

cars?
A

14

I would certainly consider it annoying# and

15

X think that we would all agree that would be annoying.

16

they should be charged with blocking traffic,
G

17
18

But suppose you don’t — do you have a

blocking traffic —

19

A

X don’t think so# Your Honor.

20

Q

You don’t think?

21

facts here.

22

anything else.

23

A

24
25

Only

We ought to have some

All we have is an ordinance.

That’s correct.

We don’t have

And X think under the

decisions of this Court I think that ordinance i® sc broad it
must not be permitted to stand# and that’s the argument —
16

Q

I
2

.

Well# what is a case in this court where all

we had was the ordinance?

3

A

1 beg your pardon, sir?

4

Q

Which ease was it that all this Court had

5
6
7
8
9

was the ordinance and no record at all?
A

Maybe 2 can refer to one quickly here,

1 think I am going t© have to search longer than I can just -~
Q

Welly in a case like Cramp against the

Board of Board of Public Instruction in Florida9 what we have

10

is the language ©f the state statute.

11

called loyalty oath which people refused t© take.

'12

there wasthe language of the statute.

13

That involved a soAll we had

Another case that comes to mind in quite a

14

different area, the First Amendment area, is Times Film against

15

Chicago, where again counsel deliberately kept all the facts

16

away from the courts , all the way through, including -this

17

Court we just had the language of the statute.

18

prior restraint of a motion picture film.

19

So there have been cases,

20

A

That involved

I hesitate to guess. Your Honor, and thank

21

you for the citations you just threw out.

22

what I aza saying is —•

I am confident that

- V

23

Q

Why is that all we have here?

24

A

I -- another attorney and hot 1 handled this

25

case up to the Supreme Court of Ohio and I am —- I believe that
17

1

he felt so strongly about this that with his client9 s permis­

2

sion he was permitted to bring this thing up on a legal

3

question only.

4

Q

would be sufficient to hold that the statute's valid as applied

to those facts, whether the Court said it was narrowed or not.

Responding to Your Honor’s first question,

Mr. Chief Justice: yes, we have such an ordinance and I think

that ordinance, like this ordinance, says to the operator ©f

20

Ohio.

21

The case involved construction of

Judge Whit® said with regard to the approach of

22

the plaintiffs in this case# he says that "It appears to us

23

that the vagueness which disturbs the plaintiffs herein results

24

from their own strained construction of the language used,

25

coupled with a modern notion among Law Review writers that

anything that is not couched in numerous paragraphs of fine

court?

He was

sitting as one of a three-judge court.

15

We think that language has some significance?

16

because all through the law is common sense; and common sense

17

says that you shall not annoy your neighbor.
Common sense also saysi your neighbor should not

18
19

be so critical that he's going to apply an impossible standard.

20

That5s our whole judicial system.
Q

21

You're not claiming in your argument that a

22

law would be good that made it a crime for one man to annoy

23

his neighbor?

24

A

I'm sorry? Your Honor? I didn't —

25

Q

You're not claiming are you that it would be
39

a valid crime if it said nothing in the world except that "It.

No? I'm not suggesting that it should just be

What you have here is a case where the word

could have a good meaning.

A

Correct.

And could make the statute valid under the

10

rules, but you don't have the facts.

11

do we do in a case like that?
A

And the problem is? what

Well, I humbly suggest that it was the

we have responded and that this Court at this point should

affirm the Court of Ohio, the Supreme Court of Ohio.

Should it affirm it or dismiss it?

Well, dismiss the case or affirm.

that this Court should affirm the court below.

Yes it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

Is it so that this is the first court in Ohio

that's upheld this statute?

A

I didn’t hear Your Honor.

wa& totally unworkable.
That’s not our case.

We defined the area in which

the activity was determined to be criminal, with specificity.

IS

Q

But not the activity.

17

A

Your Honor, respectfully, I would say that

18

the activity is defined as it relates to the relationship of

19

one human being to another.

Three or four human beings.

That is correct.

Judgment,

I think is

perhaps an element here and this Court, Judge Holmes, in the
41

i

matter of Nash versus the United States, which is not in our

2

brief, but a case 1 ran across in preparing for argument here.

3

That5s reported in 229 US 373P a 1913 anti-trust criminal case.

4

In that case this Court was faced with a determination as to

5

whether the term "unduly" was "a term that was so'"broad, and

6

vague that a man could act to his peril and face imprisonment

7

because his activities were such that unduly restraint plays.

8
3

And Justice Holmes saidf "The law is full of
instances where a man’s fate depends upon his judgment."

And he

10

went on to say that 85 a man must estimate rightly, correctly,

11

and that is as the jury subsequently estimates that conduct.

12

And that if that individual fails in judging his conduct by

13

contemporary standards, he may not only suffer a fine,or im­

14

prisonment, but he may lose his life."

IS

What we are talking about here is the judgment of

16

an individual in 'the: intercourse of social activity within his

17

community based upon con temporary standards,

18

if we constantly have to

19

a term of, I think, common understanding as the Court in

20

Fernandes versus Klinger and People versus Harvey thought it

21

was, then you will have even more problems across this land,

22

because people will says does ‘the law really mean what Webster

23

says, or does it mean something else or what’s it all about?

There is no yardstick; you would have to

there is no yardstick as to how loud in order to be annoying;

Well, I would say tills, that there is no

yardstick with regard to the decibel level outside your house

my house.

I suppose that, in the words of the statute,

24

that if a person would pass by or a person who is an occupant

25

of an adjacent building, simply testified that these three

defendants assembled on a sidewalk or street corner or vacant

a

lot, or mouth of an alley adjacent to the building where I

defendants would be guilty? wouldn't they?

I certainly would -think so,
