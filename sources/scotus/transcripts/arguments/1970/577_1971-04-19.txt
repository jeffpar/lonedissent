and a female traveling companions one Geraldine Harris* crossed
the Mexican-“American border on foot at San Ysidro* California.
Inspector McCown* who at that time had 27 years experience as
a customs inspector at -that port of entry? San Ysidro* observed
Miss Johnson and her companion and questioned them. He there­
upon became suspicious that they were carrying contraband so he
arranged for a personal search to b@ conducted by a female
inspector so that their clothes could be thoroughly searched.
This type of search is frequently referred to as a “strip
search.I!
The search in this ease wasconducted by Mrs. Netta

explanation that the Government had to prove something more

Defense Counsel, in essence, argued that a strip

search was invalid under the Fourth Amendment, in the absence

6

of an affirmative showing of objective grounds for real

7

suspicion.

The Government Attorney relied on the Ninth Circuit

8

case of Witt v. United States, where a strip search revealted

9

narcotics concealed in Defendant's brassiere and it was upheld

10

©n that basis on the basis that mere suspicion was enough to

11

justify such a search.

rejected the defense claim that it was the Government's burden
to establish on a motion to suppress reason for Inspector
MeCown's suspicions.

The case was tried without a jury

©n the

basis of the testimony of the two inspectors and certain
stipulations.

The court found for the Defendant — found the

Defendant guilty and the Court ©f Appeals reversed, holding that
the trial court's ruling on the motion was erroneous in the
light ©f that court ~ that's the Ninth Circuit Court decision
in United States v. 6uadalup@-Garza.
And, although the Guadalupe “Gars® case involved &
cavity as opposed to a strip search, the Ninth Circuit did
define for the first time in that opinion the requirements, and
I put in quotess "Beal suspicion.”
5

The court said that a strip

1

search cannot foe conducted on mere suspicion, that something

2

more was necessary, and this amounts to real suspicion.

3

It defined the term “real suspicion” as follows?

4

“Real suspicion justifying the initiationof a strip search is

5

subjective suspicion supported by objective, articulable facts

6

which reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs officer

7

to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border

8

is concealing something on his foody for the purpose of trans-”

9

porting it into the United States, contrary to law.
The Court ©£ Ajspeals held that the search in the

10

11

instant case did not meat this standard since the Government

12

could not prove that there were objective, articulable

13

tosupport the inspector’s suspicion.

facts

The dissenting judge was of the view that Garsa

14
15

was distinguishable, since it dealt with a cavity search, which

16

required a more stringent standard than a simple inspection of

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

clothing.

In Ms view the

'case was "on all fours83 with Witt v.

the United States, which ahad approved a personal search.
Parenthetically, the Garsa case was decided ©n
February 2, 1970, which was more than nine months after the
District Court had decided the instant case.
We believe that the Court of Appeals should be
reversed for at least three reasons.

First, the statutory

authority for a customs inspector to conduct a personal search
©n the basis of suspicion is clear and unequivocable.

S

Second,

j

1

the great public need to step the huge inflow of contraband,

2

particularly narcotics, into this country, demands that the

3

balancing of the governmental interest in inspection against

;

i
4

the traveler's interest in minimizing inconvenience and em­

5

barrassment be resolved in favor of the government»

6

And third, that the ninth Circuit's objective,

7

articulable facts test is an impractical and unworkable one.

8

Now, the statute in questions 19 USC 482 clearly

states that 'the cues toms officer may search any parson on whom

13

believe what it meant simply that a personal search may fos

IS

w© think they would have stated it because in this statute,

16

this very statutas 482, th@y set up two different standards of j

It dates back to 18,15 ’«'hen it was first enacted, and

2

at -that time they had the mere suspicion test in the statute?

3

in fact it was an extension of an even older statute, going

4

back to the First Congress of tee United States.

Could I ask you? search of baggage, is

there an unrestricted, absolute right t© inspect baggage?

A

1

As it comes ©v@r the border? yes, sir, but

8

you will notice that this part of the statute says "wherever

9

found,” which means that it would go beyond the borders and if

10

they could trace the baggage into the interior and therefore

11

I think they wanted a higher standard ©nee the baggage goo into

the interior.

Mo, this is the only ©ne.

As a matter of

there is —

says —

1

A

That'Js right.

That's whatit says.

2

Now, in the — in 1815 when this statute was first;

3

enacted, and it contains this provision, 1 believe that,

4

because of the kind of contraband that existed at that time,

5

Congress must have thought that occasions could arise when a

6

person would have to be stripped in order to search their

7

clothing for contraband, but if there is any question about

8

that, Congress laid it to rest in 1866 because Congress r@en~

0

i
acted this law in 1866 and added a provision, a provision which'

W

provided that the Secretary of the Treasury would employ female

11

inspectors for the purpose of examining and searching persons

12

of their own sex, which means that they anticipated that there ;

13

would be these kinds of personal searches.
Now, at this point I would like to draw a dis­

14

17

m
19

20
21

22
23

tinction between the strip search that I have been talking about,
and the cavity search.

that this statute would not apply for a cavity search, because
the last time that the Congress enacted this law was in 1866
and at that time carrying contraband in the cavities of the bodf
body certainly were not in vogue, and furthermore, medical
science did not develop to '{sfo© QXfeeftfe that somebody could take
some contraband, put it in the stomach, later regurgitate it
and still use it —
Q

We well realise that people may argue

were idler© ?

What's your idea of suspicion?

A

Suspicion means an uncertainty about

something, or I should say — I could tell you exactly what it

5

is because I happen to have written it down, but I don't have

6

it right handy#

1

that there is something wrong on the basis of little or no

8

evidence.

Q

Now, could it b@ this much -- somewhere, I

think in this record, or maybe I read it elsewhere outside the

record, that this particular port of @ntry, San Ysidro, if Iem

evidently a great deal of illegal narcotics are smuggled across;

used and is exactly wh&tis meant when you apply the term

Is not that the standard ~

j

the border.

*
Maybe t© that • extent that8s assumed, t© the

extent that @n@ out of ©very 15 people who cone across the
i

border at that particular point is smuggling narcotics.
12

Could j

the service just decide &r hitrarily at random to have a

1

personal search of ©vary 15th person who comes across?

2

i.

A

3

X don31 believe the service -- would do

that , hut 1 do think that the Congress —~

4

Q

5

But if ray hypothesized

facts are correct

6

there is one chance in 15 that as to each person that comes

7

across the border, that fee's smuggling narcotics and that's

8

enough for a suspicion, I suppose? isn't it?
A

9

Well, yon could argue that but X rather

think that it would be better for theCongrass to review the

10

entire situation and set some rules that one out ©f ©very 15

11

people can be searched*

12

Q

13

Well, if there is one chance out of ©very

15, statistically, then isn't that a ground for suspicion with,

14

respect to each person who comes across the border?

15

A

16

It would be a ground? in fact it"3 the

ground 1 imagine that is used with respect fe© baggage? that's

17
li

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

why they search every single person's baggage»
Q

Well, with respect to checking on income

tax returns, and so on»

These are arbitrary random samplings,

so 1 understand.
A

But that's not @© much suspicion as it is a

random sampling.
Q

Well, if it3s known that ©ns out of every

5© persons is likely to either cheat ©r make serious mistakes

13

1

la his income tax returns, one way to get at it when you can't

2

look at all the returns, is to randomly checkon® out of ©very

3

50, with the suspicion that you will perhaps find either fraud

4

or gross error®
A

S

But I think that the statute here relates

6

to a customs officer.

He must have the suspicion.

Infact

7

there have h@en cases where the customs officer himself did

8

not have the suspicion? the court ruled that the search was not!

9

proper.

7

Q

10

Well, 1 would think, X would just merely

11

suggast that it could b© argusd that if the customs officer has

12

knowledge statistically, -based on his ejsperienss at that par-

13

port of entry that on© out of ©very 15 people ware smuggling,

14

then isn't there on® chance out of 16 enough to suspect each

15

person who comes in there?

16
17
18
19
,20
21

22
23
24

25

A

It could be argued? yes»

Q

D© you think that Congress has the con­

stitutional power to pass a statute saying that everybody com­
ing back to this country from ©broad must submit to a body
search?
A

X would think that if Congress looked into

the matter, held hearings and found out that the incidence of
smuggling was so great that they could pass such a statute,
because they have the basic responsibility for controlling
foreign commerce and what is imported into the Onited States.

14

1

I think if they could make a case for this, that that could
*

■

2

be allowed if one would pass such legislation.
Q

3
4

That would be a national finding of pro­

bable cause, rather than a judicial finding of probable cause?
A

5

Well, I think, frankly, Mr. Justice, that

6

the Congress could probably be in a better position by holding

1

hearings and being able to get so much more information than a

8

court can get in a case-by-case basis that it would be a better

9

way of doing it —
Q

10
11

I'm not talking about whether it's better

or nofc| I'm just thinking in terms of the Fourth Amendment.
A

12

Well, I would think that the Fourth Amend­

S3

ment is grounded in reasonableness and I think if it could be

14

shown that we are in such a difficult position — it is highly

19

25

I
theoretical, because I don't think it would ever happen, but
if it were such — if the Congress were able to show that al­
most every person were smuggling something into this country
then I think they could go as far as passing alaw to that
effect.
Q

Well, as far as examination of baggage is

concerned, apparently the routine custom inspection, which all
of us have gone through, is beyond the statutory authority,
from what you said.
A

That is true.

Q

Did anybody ever challenge it?
15

\
Ss>Cv\

1

A

Nope.

2

Q

Getting back to this particularcase, if

3

the officer had been a brand new officer of three days on duty,

4

would your argument be the same?

5

A

Would the argument be the same?

No, sir --

6

Q

Because, as I read the statute I

don't

7

think that the statute says that he has to have any other —
A

13

perience at all.

it could possibly happen, Mr. Justice, because you see he would
probably go to his superior, who would then not allow it to be
done».

But

15
16

19

suspicion?

21

22

Q

The statute doesn't require that.

A

No? the statute does not require that.

Q

Is there any regulation of the Treasury or

Immigration which defines suspicion?

18

20

But, I would think that if it happened with

somebody with three days on duty -— first of all, I don't think

14

It doesn't say you have to have any ex­

No.

Well, how does the agent know what is

Oh, yes.

Q

What cbes it say?

A

It says that the agent

has a very signi-

ficant power, and that's the power to have personal searches
made upon suspicionf and that he should use that power very
wisely and it gives various illustrations that would show him
i

8

10
11

how to use the power but it's not a completely comprehensive
it doesn't cover every possible circumstance.

He also goes to j

school and he°s taught further there and he also has very close

Ites been raised by

concluding remarks.

12

The first and foremost way Congress enacted the

14

be imagined they had in those days even a remote thought that a

15

party coming into this country might be made naked at port of

Whereas in SeberonC?) plain talking to a bunch

of narcotics addicts did not meet the standard, again arguing
a case-by-case method, a case-by-case basis for argument.

I

can remember trying this case in the District Court and X can
remember trying the genesis of U.S.A. versus Henderson where
District Judge KunzeM?), now deceased, made a footnote and he
said in his many years at San Ysidro he has come to believe
that there must be something that the officer

can tell why he

wants that woman searched.
It must be noted in this case that

co-companion,

Geraldine Harris, was without contraband and X note four or
five times in this case it has been suggested that counsel
•didn't cross-examine the officer.
23

X can answer that with the

1

footnote that appears in Seabron that the moment counsel there

2

began talking about the weapon he swiftly retreated from that

3

kind of cross-examination and I did say I wouldn’t put my foot

4

into it at that time and I believed it was the Government’s

5

burden, as I do now.

6

It is my argument —

7

Q

Is it a. fact that 180 years ago could any

8

vessel enter any port in the United States, or the 13 Colonies

9

then, without being searched from stem to stern?
A

10

I doubt very much.

I don’t think it should

11

be that way today.

A vessel is a carrier of notoriously large

12

objects.

13

like this.

14

rather than a person* must receive a different treatment.

Major narcotics is brought in in vessels and ships
I think that the law as to vessels and things,

Here the Government concedes, in talking about the

17

skin search, two.

issue, as to what, if anything is needed to compel a woman or

20

a man, as the case may foe, to remove her clothing and get

21

And this is really the issue, and only the

naked.
Q

Would you think that the constitutional

23

problem would be cured, if a physician or a registered nurse

24

made the examination?

25

A

No, I don't, not if the inception of it was
29

1

based on nothing more than we have in Sandra Denise Johnson's

2

case I do not* which leads me to an argument I wish to raise

3

quickly.

4

border and 1 recall in Justice Jackson's dissent in

5

Brenniter (?) how then Justice Jackson referred to the record

6

of an officer, that as always he wants to protect that.

7

in the business, the competitive business of ferreting out

3

crime and he indicates in all of these that he has no pre­

9

judices, that he has no cause for alarm about race or age or

10

Agent MeCown has had 27 years experience on that

He9s

anything.

ii

X only wish to suggest and X note that my opponent

12

today has the title of Judge and X presume that that's because

13

Mr. Pierce is probably retired, but — from the berich — but,

14

as a criminal lawyer for 13 years, in asking maybe 50 or 60

16

18

And X never once got an .affirmative answer and I quit asking

19

that question because it was inconceivable to me that 700 or

20

800 veniremen wouldn't hold a prejudice.
So, when the customs agent indicates, as he is

21

supposed to on cross-examination that he has no such feelings,
may I suggest that all of us carry something with us as a police
officer.

His answer in the

11

if, for example there were statistical, empirical objective

12

evidence that among young men whose hair is down to their

13

shoulders one out of every two is a smuggler and among those

14

who had crew cuts, only one out of every 100 is a smuggler,

15

wouldn’t a customs officer doing his duty, be a little more

16

careful when he searched the person whose hair was down to his

shoulders, and it might not represent any personal prejudice

18

on his part whatsoever.
A

19

1 concur totally; that’s empirical, objec-

20

than mere suspicion that caused 4,811 citizens in 1969 to be

12

Mr. Beckler, going back over some ground

13

that you have already covered, I did understand correctly, did

14

I not, that you have no concern about indiscriminate search of

15

luggage?

16
17

A

I do not, Your Honor? I do not.

Q

And you draw the distinction then only by

18

a balancing of interest, even though the Fourth Amendment

19

reads as to effects, as well as to one’s person?

20
21

22
23

24
25

A

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I feel that, as Mr.

Chief Justice suggested, that when one brings in objects he
should well anticipate, if he wants to enjoy the freedom of our
soil that that should be looked at.
Q

Well, sometimes people don?fc bring in ob­

jects? underclothing can be in luggage as wallas on the person.
32

\
A

1

It can be? yes,

I appreciate that? I

2

appreciate that problem, but I think in the effects of the

3

person, the effects indicated in the Fourth Amendment, -chat

4

does have a different status, rather than the person.

5

that at no time in the history of our country,'was it imagined

6

or expected when the Fourth Amendment was enacted or through

1

ail this Court5s great history that it was thought the people

8

would ever have to be made naked and now we find that such a

9

right can exist and should exist with the advent of personal

I think

10

carrying of narcotics, but the Fourth Amendment is the oversees

11

of that right and it should be, as the Ninth Circuit said in

12

suppressing

the evidence in the District Court on an objec­

13

tive, articulable basis, a real suspicion directed at this

14

person, something that adds scope to the search.

15

My final argument is simply .that there was a piece

16

©f literature by Maxwell Anderson not to© many years ago, and

17

there was a character in there called Judge Gaunt, who ran

18

around, after making a very bad rule, testing his own rules. I

19

played devil"s advocate in this case and I have tested the

20

proposition on district attorneys and U. S, Attorneys, on ladies,

21

men and fellow citizens alike, and the overwhelming

22
23
24
25

reaction

that I have received is that before 'a citizen should be made
naked it should be on an objective basis.
I ask that the Court, of Appeals8 decision be
affirmed in suppressing the evidence.
