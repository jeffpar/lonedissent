ORAL ARGUMENT BY EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

9

I think it’s fair to say that the Appellants have

10

taken briefs and argued this appeal as if no evidence .had been

11

received and no records made in the court below.

12

what they are asking this Court to do is to render an advisory

In effect,

opinion on a hypothetical caricature on what they call a
"sectarian institution" of higher learning.
Twice in their briefs, and yesterday during oral
argument, Counsel said what the court below has held is that
an institution which admits only students of a particular
religion requires them to participate in religious activity,
compels them to comply with the doctrines and dogmas of the
religion, forces them to attend church and does everything but
propagate and advance a particular religion other than confer
degrees in divinity, can constitutionally received governmental
funds so long as in its bookkeeping it allocates these funds fee
the construction of a chemistry laboratory or gymnasium.
I say to the Court that the record will demonstrata
2

i

that not a single one of those qualifications is germane or

2

applicable to a single institution before this Court as

3

Appellee; nor do they make that contention, because in the very

4

next sentence they say: "We do not contend that any of the

5

four institutional defendants here and 50 above, composite a

6

description of sectarian educational institution.”
Now, in the court below the Appellees called

7
8

witnesses to the point of taxing the spirit of the cumulative

9

evidence rule and of testing the patience of a three-judge

10

court to show without contradiction, without refutation and I

11

say, without cross-examination, that first the funded facili­

12

ties of these schools were never used, are not being used for

13

any religious worship, for any religious instruction.

have no symbols or artifacts of religion housed therein.

In these buildings?

A

N®, sir-; not in these buildings, but the

institutions themselves, first of all, do have courses in
religion, but the evidence was without contradiction that none
of these schools indoctrinate, propagate or proselytise the
tenets of any religion.
Q

But, my question was narrower.

In these

buildings may they teach 'the history of religion?

No; they do not, in fact, do that, Mr.

If they taught religion, Mr. Chief Justice,

or if they worshipped in these buildings there would be a
violation of their contractual commitment to the Government
under which they received a small portion of the cost of these
buildings, and they would be amenable to suit for recovery of
the amount that the Government has contributed.
Q

Mr. Williams, before you leave that, what

Now, we heard yesterday, I think, from

Mr. ‘ riedman, that there is something in the way of policing
what, goes on in these buildings.

Do you see any problem con­

nected with that?
.i

I see none} Mr. Justice.

institutions contract in good faith that they will not teach

Is the commitment, Mr. Williams, a nega­

tiva one or an affirmative one?

Is it an affirmative one in

the sense that there is an engagement, a commitment firmly to
teach chemistry or whatever completely secular subjects?
A

17
18

Was there any evidence that, in fact, any

policing had bean done and that -- what form it took?

11

14

The Court found that the evidence was un*

-contradicted, unrefuted by any scintilla of evidence, that

Well, is there any evidence in this case

Justice.

It's a negative commitment, Mr. Chief

However, in this particular case the buildings were

science buildings, a foreign language laboratory, a music, art
and drama building and two libraries.

The libraries were shown

to have completely open policies with respect to books.

The

record shows that each of these institutions has adopted the
American Association of University Professors5 policy on
tenure and academic freedom? that there is no inhibition with
respect to what any teacher may teach within the confines of
5
1

t

his own discipline on this campus? that there is no required

2

religious worship whatsoever at any of these institutions?

3

that there is no form of indoctrination at any of these in­

4

stitutions, and that these institutions are funded by tuition,

gifts, endowments and fees,

a degree, the required attendance at. those courses?
A

At three of the institutions, Mr, Justice,

it. is required for Catholics to take courses in religion and
at the fourth institution there is a requirement that all
students take a course in religion, but it is interesting to
note, Mr. Justice, that there is a stipulation in this case
which covers all of the institutions that the courses in
religious study cover a range of human religious experiences
and are not limited to courses about the Roman Catholic
6

t

religion and it’s further interesting to note* if the Court

2

please, that the one institution which requires religion in

3

order to matriculate for a Liberal Arts Degree, has a series

4

of courses which are, in all respects, I suggest to the Court,

5

identical with the courses being offered at Trinity College at

And 1 invite the Court to look at Defendant's

where courses and theories of religion, problems of religion,

modern Jewish life and — American protestantism, faith and

That's exactly so? Mr. Justice.

Appellants consistently

11

urged upon the lower court that the test should be the nature

of the institution which is the incidental beneficiary of the

grant.
Wa consistently urged upon the Court that the
test should foe what this Court has ' volved in the course o£
25 years from Harrison to McGowan to Sbant(?) to Allen and
finally in Epperson? that the test is whether the statute has
a secular purpose and its primary effect that neither advances
nor inhibits religion and ~
Q

Would you stop right there a momento

A

Yes? sir.

Q

To the extent that there is policing of

what goes on in these funded public — public*”funded buildings?
do you see any hasard of inhibition? inhibiting religion?
A

1 d© not? Mr. Justice? for these reasons --

8

Q

t

Welly as I gather, policing would mean

z

stepping in and a lot of interrogation by government officials

3

sis to whether or not this course or that course has a reli­

4

gious content?

5

A

1 think it would not require stepping in

6

and it would not require a lot of surveillance.

First of all,

7

I don't think it dees violence presumptively to expect that

8

these colleges and universities will deal with Idle government

9

in good faith.

Certainly there would be no incentive to con­

10

duct religious worship or sectarian instruction in an expen­

11

sive building that is devoted to science and filled with labor-'

12

atories or the library,

13

can fully serve that purpose.

/hen there are other buildings that

But I would like to take, Mr. Justice, tha

14

IS

concave side of this convex proposition and apply the Walls

16

Test, as articulated by this Court to the statuto we're deal­

17
18
19

ing with.

plementary to the purpose and primary effect test, as I read
that decision.
The Court said, t5We must look at the primary

20
21

22
23
24
25

In Walls there was a caveat, a caveat that was sup­

effect and notice whether or not there is involved an excessive
I
entanglement between state and religioni between church and
state.

Hew, here there is the most perfunctory kind of sur­

veillance that may take place in the event that a complaint is
lodged that there was religion being conducted in one of these

9

1

buildings, but let's look at the other side»
Counsel for the Appellants say, and they say

2
3

— that "We concede that all church-related schools are not

4

barred from this program.” Well, then, what schools are bar­

3

red?
"The schools that are barred,"say they, "the

6
7

theory of our suit is that the constitution forbids support by

8

the Federal Government ©f any institution which teaches or

S

practices religion."
Again they said, in the lower courts "If the in­

10

1!
12

stitution teaches ©r practices religion it is unconstitutional
to allocate it funds."
la this Court they say, "We asseris that under the

13
14
15
16

establishment clause an institution is barred from receiving
funds if the propagation, teaching or practice of religion is
a meaningful and major part ©f its existence.”
So, what is the criterion that they urge?

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

They

urge, laced throughout their briefss the Horace Mann test,
promulgated by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland in
1968.

Mow, what is the Horace Mann test?

It involves, first

of all, a determination of the purpose of the college.

Second,

it involves an analysis of the religious constituency of the
governing board, the student body, the faculty and the admin­
istrati v©s.

It involves a determination as to where the school

gets its financial support? whether religion and prayer are
10

meaningful and significant on these campuses? whether the

1

2

activities of the alumni are really projections or extensions

3

of the teachings of the school and what the image of the school

4

is in the community»

,

I suggest that to applythat test that is being

S
6

urged by the Appellants? is the very kind of entanglement that

7

this Court has eschewed and shunned and avoided in relationship

3

to the ad valorem real estate tax test? in Walls against the

9

Tax Commission? because it would require a positive surf”

10

vaillance to determine the ever-changing character in institu­

1?

tions of 817 church-related colleges and universities»
Sixty percent of the private schools in America

12

13

today, private higher educational institutions? are church-

14

related.

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

To think that Appellants' test would throw ‘die

whole administration of the Higher Education Facilities Act
into chaos and confusion? it would cast doubt over -the eligi­
bility for a grant of 60 percent of the private higher educa­
tional institutions in the United States and introduce an
amorphous test incapable of application without continued sur­
veillance as these schools change their character to meet the
test imposed by the Court,
So? I suggest? as against that? Mr, Justice? as
against that? for which they contend that, the kind of sur­
veillance that is necessary t© look at a building and see
whether ©r not in a building there is any religious instruction?
11

1

is de minimis
Q

2

Mr, Williams» X take it you think it's

3

unnecessary to address yourself to whether or not the case

4

would be different if you did have a school here that satisfied

3

your opponents' definition of a sectarian institution?
A

6

X don't think it's unnecessary fco address

7

myself to that if you are interested in it» Mr, Justice,

3

think this s that the kind of institution that he has hypo­

9

thesised here» as the basis for asking this Court, for an ad­

10

visory opinion» makes it impossible» X suggest» to segregate

n

the secular from the sectarian; the secular from the religious.

12

And X suggest to the Court —

And X don't think that there is one unless

it he a divinity school» Mr. Justice» and they have been
carved out of the act specifically.

But» the kind of institu­

tion that he hypothesises» X don't know of a single one nor
hasone been suggested by the Appellants.
And X suggest that the Appellants repeatedly

20
21

In those institutions — in an institution

of that kind» if there are any?

15
16

X

reminded the lower court that they could have brought this case
in any one of SO jurisdictions and they could have named any
one ©f a number of institutions and they named the Secretary
of Health» Education» and Welfare; they brought it in Connecicut.

X don't think that it's a violent presumption to suggest
12

1

that -they brought it in a jurisdiction which was not eviden­

2

tially unfavorable to the cause which they were asserting»
Q

I understand.

I just wonder how far this

theory of yours goes, because we have other cases like that
coming up»
A

n

Well, we have clergymen across the road

12

here on the payroll in Congress, and 1 suppose if they are

13

doing a wholly secular function

14

gate le so that -there can be no gainsay that what they are doing

15

is purely secular that would be possible.
In Bradfield against Roberts we had an institution

!6
17
18
19
20

21

owned, controlled and operated by a monastic order of nuns.
This was decided in 1899 and a contract was entered into foetween -the Federal Government arid this monastic order of nuns
to erect an isolation ward at the Providence Hospital, which
is still extant here in the District of Columbia.

22
23

24
25

if it is secularly segre­

Q

Of course that wasn't an educational in­

A

It was not an educational institution, Mr.

stitution.

Justice, but insofar as the focus is whether it is sectarian or

13

i

secular, I suggest to you that there is no difference between

z

practical medicine and teaching science, mathematics or a

3

foreign language because each is a fully secular function and

4

that's what the Government is subsidising in

s

Roberts and my brother concedes that so long as the function it

s

purely secular that a contribution or subsidy may be made to a

7

church institution.

He mad® ‘that concessionhere yesterday.

Now, this function was wholly secular in Bradfielc

8

Bradfield v.

v. Roberts and the sol® line of distinction -that counsel was

10

able to draw between Bradfield against Roberts and the case

11

at bar, was that Bradfield against Roberts had an open admis­

12

sions policy, suggesting to this

untruth from the record.

Well, what if they did, though, Mr.

Suppose there was a condition for matriculation

that you be a Catholic?
A

Well, there couldn't be here, Mr. —

Q

Well, 1 know there couldn't be, but — and

you suggest that it's just really an academic question, and
ifcmay be that there aren’t any schools like that.
A

There aren't any schools like that and

there can't be under this statute because Plaintiff's Exhibit
Number 126, which is in evidence, shows that each of the
schools must affirm and must give assuran.ce that they are
14

(

i

complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which

7

What happens to these buildings at the end
I think Mr. Friedman touched on

The Government's interest in these

8

buildings, Mr. Justice, under the statute, exists for 20 years

9

and at the end of 20 years there is no further surveillance.
I should say —

for purely religious purposes?

Are they free to use these buildings then

A

They are free to use them as they choose,

Q

As they choose.

A

Now, may I respond to a question that you

Mr. Justice.

propounded yesterday.

I think you asked, if I recall correctly,

how much money these institutions before the bar received in
the STate of Connecticut?
They rec

ved a total of $1,300,000?. out of $18

million -that were given to institutions in the State of
Connecticut during the same period of time.
Now, I think it's significant, Mr. Justice, to
recognise that in each instance, in each instance the univer­
sity or the college receives less than 20 percent of the cost
15

i

of the building.

The maximum that they can receive is 33

2

percent.

3

University,the record shows cost over $4 million? the grant

4

was $500,000.

For example, the science building at Fairfield

Now, comparable figures are true with respect to

5
6

the library? and a library at Sacred Heart University? -a

7

$24,000 grant was given to Albertus Magnus for the foreign

8

language laboratory where the students may go to listen and

9

practice modern language.

10

So that it is not, Mr. Justice, as though the

11

Government is giving a building, a whole building to these

12

schools.

13

building and the schools must commit to pay the rest, the

14

design fee to increase the academic facilities across the

5
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It is giving a small percentage of the cost of the

country. So that instead of 4,200,000 students hav ng a
college education in 1960, 7 million students are having a
college education in the 1970s, as projected by the then
President when

he proposed this legislation.

Now, if the Court please —
Q

I suppose you would agree that the Federal

Government —* neither the Federal Government nor a state could
have created these institutions, launched them, chartered them,
financed them?
A

Well, I think that, Mr. Justice --

Q

In -their entirety.
16

A

1

In their entirety we would run afoul of

2

the establishment clause because in that instance they would

3

be launching an institution which was teaching religion and

4

it would be subsidising the institution in its entirety.
Q

S

That would also, of course be true of Yale

or Harvard or Columbia or Princton, wouldn't it?

6
7

8

A

Yale —

Q

The Federal Government couldnst have

started any of those the way they ware started.

9

Q

10
about today.

I?

Well, the way they were.

Icm talking

Starting up Yale today I suppose that could be

a Federal institution without any; problem.

12

A

13

Well, it5s interesting to not©, Mr.
\

Justice, that Yale today, of course, has a department of

14

religion and I think offers a selection about as broad as the

15

institutions which are before the Bar.

16

Trinity and Weslyan,

which were mentioned in the complaint filed by the Plaintiffs,

17

I suggest, has religious courses that are as broad as the

18

religious courses that are offered in the case at Bar.

19

Q

20

By any chance does this record show that

the cost is of some of the major medical schools in the country.,

21

funded by the Federal Government', such as Harvard Medical

22

School?

23

A

Now, this Court has recognized, in its promulga­

tion of the purpose and primary effect test on four occasions

s

-- on four occasions as that test has evolved, historically,

7

beginning in 1947, and rearticulated again last year, that 'the

8

purpose and primary effect test presumes that there may be

9

some incidental benefits to religion.

It

It presumed it in Epperson, it presumed it in

10
11

McGowan against Maryland (the Sunday closing laws)% it presumed

12

it in Board of Education against Allen (the textbook law) and

13

of course, it presumed it in Walz.
Now, again, this Court has said on three occa­

14
15
16
17
18
19

sions, three occasions, clearly and unambiguously, that the
mandate of the constitution in the establishment clause, is
not that the Government must be hostile to religion, but that
i

itmust be neutral as between religion and irreligion and as
among the sects of religion.
It said this in Edison,* it said it in Borak

21

22

25

against Clausen and it said it in Afobington against Shem
clearly.

I suggest to the Court that if the Congress had

gerrymandered the church-related schools out of this building
by virtue of the fact that they were teaching religion, or by
virtue of the fact that worship was
18

taking place on the

1

campus, that it will have manifested a constitutionally

2

inhibited hostility to religion.
Wow, again, this Court has said and has said

3
4

three times in applying the purpose and primary effect test,

5

that the foeus in determining the effect, the focus in deter­

6

mining the secularity of the effect, is not on the nature ©f

the institution receiving the benefits, but is on the function

being subsidized.

the function being subsidized, not on the nature of ‘the in­

And finally, it said in Board of Education against

14

Allen, that it's the function being subsidized that is the

16

determinative factor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

19

20

MR. PFEFFER:

21

First, I find it necessary to correct a statement

22
23

24
25

made by Mr. Williams.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I do so because it's critical to this

decision.
Mr. Williams said that the statute ,requires the
institutions to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
22

1

1964, which forbids all forms of discrimination.

And Mr.

z

Williams is in error, because it does not forbid all forms of

3

discrimination.

4

forbids discrimination on race, color or nationality, but it

S

does permit — the word "religion" was deliberately taken out.

6

It does permit religious discrimination? it does permit the

7

use of Federal funds to finance an institution which dis­

8

criminates religiously.

9

because, as I pointed out, the difference between Bradfield,

It does permit religious discrimination.

It

This is clearly within this case,

to

the difference in all of the cases is that this case allows an

It

institution to discriminate religiously, to exclude on a

12

religious basis.

13
14
15

I also want to make clear our position.

We do

not concede any facts other than the fact that the institutions
which, in Connecticut or all over the United States, do make

16

a written commitment that in the particular facilities filed

17

they will not teach or practice religion.

18

We do not agree with Mr. Williams* interpretation
*
of the record below. We have here — we have prepared charts

19
20

to show our analysis of the evidence, which to leads to con­

21

clusions directly contrary to Mr. Williams.

22

them here because there have been no findings of fact.

between what evidence is relevant.

23

We contended that the

evidene© which is relevant is that which dealt with the time

2

when the grants to these institutions were authorised by the

3

Government.

4

Mr. Williams, why we didnst cross-examine — we objected to

it — dealt with facts which occurred after ~ after those

grants were authorized, which, after the date of trial and

We contend that the evidence which we presented

Now, if the Court views that to be a critical

fact, as I believe it is, I think the Court is not a ferial

10

Well, you wouldn’t deny that the

It

suggest also that the establishment clause is so rigid that

12

a legislature may not take notice of free exercise values in

13

terms of a program like this?
A

14
15
16
17
18

stitution must be considered.

21

22

My argument is, on the contrary,

that the history of the struggle for freedom of religion in
this country is in a large measure a history against compul­
sory taxation for religious purposes.
It is ourcontention, on the contrary, that to tax

19
20

On the contrary, I think the whole con­

me, a nonCatholie, in order to support an institution which
-s.

is Catholic

(undiscernable)
Now, in respect to the Bradfield against Roberts,

23

that Mr. Williams spoke on, I tried yesterday to distinguish

24

that in the brief, but I think the test could be said to be

25

this, to distinguish Bradfield and other cases: the test is

25

i

whether the facility is free-standing or integrated into the

2

totality of a curriculum whereby the same student is exposed

3

to the propagation of religion and the institution has, as its

4

major purpose, to, propagate religion to that student.

/
What I mean by this is that if the services at

5

the hospital are part of a unit which includes inculcation of

€

7

a religious doctrine and the student and the patient must taka

8

both, his treatment for his disease and propagation of-religion,

9

that’s unconstitutional.

That is the situation in this case.

No person can walk off the street and come in and

10

say, "I want to use this chemistry laboratory or this biology
"/
laboratory," or "I want to enroll only for this one course."

11
12
13

He is a complete student; he must take the whole works, in-

14

eluding a course in the propagation of the Catholic religion.
That, I believe, is the test.

15

Now, one word about purpose.

16

We are in this Court

because the Congress is a coordinate branch of government? this

17

Court, of course, is bound by the Congress's statement of

18

~

now, I don't believe that is true with respect to states,

19

legislatures, but with respect to Congress.

20

But, it must

examine what that purpose is.

21

Mr. Friedman pointed out that the purpose is to

22

increase enrollment in school, not to give additional facilities

23

to anyone who wants those facilities, but in order to increase

24

enrollment in those schools.

25

And youcan't do it.
