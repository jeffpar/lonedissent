ARGUMENT OF PAUL N. HALVONIK, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HALVONIK:

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

0

Court.

Petitioner in this case is a conscientious objector.

9

Being such* he quite naturally refused to submit to induction.

10

He was tried for that offense, failure to submit to induction,

11

was found guilty and —

12

Q

Would you raise your voice slightly?

13

A

Yes, Your Honor -- he was found guilty and was

14

sentenced to two years in prison.
I observed that he was a conscientious objector.

15

How­

16

ever that claim has never been passed on by Ms local board,

17

and the reason for that is he did not become a conscientious

18

objector until after he received his notice to report for in­

19

duction.

20

a conscientious objector, and at the time he became a con­

21

scientious objector, according to the local board, it no longer

22

had jurisdiction to review his claim.

23

contends, is a correct reading of the Selective Service regula­

24

tions of the Selective Service law, so that an objector, such

25

as Ehlert, can never have his claim heard.

He couldn't have applied for the status before he was

2

And that, the government

!

We think the government is misreading the regulation

1
2

because there is a regulation that provides for reopening of

3

classifications and reconsiderations by the local board if,

4

after an order to report for induction has been mailed,

5

has been a change in the registrant's status resulting from

S

circumstances over which the registrant had no control, and we

7

contend that regulation is applicable here.

8
9

Q

there

You mean his change in attitude was something

over which he had no control?

10

A

Yes, Your Honor, but the Second Circuit and other

11

circuits, following the Gearev decision,

12

of conscience v?hen that moment arrives when he decides that he

13

can do nothing else but not participate in war, when that

14

moment comes

15

he has no control and ivhich --

16

Q

called it erystali^ation

this crystalization is the circumstance over which

Well, did they-«ay in those cases whether the

r/

circumstance was one over which they had no control or the time

18

or both?

19

A

Well, in terms of the time, which is after the

20

order to report for induction,

21

say that the reopening occurs under 1625.2 and that language in

22

that regulation is that you have to reopen it if there were

23

circumstances over which the registrant had no control.

24

theory of the majority below in the Ninth Circuit here is that

25

one does have control over bis conscience and for that reason

the cases to which 1 refer all

3

The

the registrant wouldn't come within the regulations.

1 don't

think the government is currently -- at least not very enthusi­
astically -- supporting that view.

The government seems to 3ay

now that this isn't a circumstance within the meanino of the
s tafcute.
They cite an authority for that and they seem to
claim that a circumstance has to be some sort of external event
that is verifiable.

I think that is confusing with the circum­

stances within the meaning of the regulation.

The circumstance,

1 assume the regulation means approximate circumstance, that is
to say if one, after receiving notice to report for induction,,
should be struck by an automobile and have a leg broken,

the

circumstances that results in the reopening is not being struck
by an automobile but by having the broken leg.

It is not the

external event, if you wi31
Q

Some qf us on this end of the bench are having

grear difficulty in hearing you.
A

I will try to speak up.

Q

Would you please?

A

Another analogy might be,

since the government

seems to be saying it has to be an event that is external and
i

verifiable, should a man actually receive an order to report for
induction become mentally incompetent, I think we would say that
there has been a circumstance over which he had no control which
had intervened and which required a reclassification.
4

Now,

there

1

would be nothing outside the man that we would look to to call

2

a circumstance. . And yet, without torturing the language at

S

ail, we would say that some circumstance had occurred that

4

changed the status and he was no longer competent, he was no

S

longer a person who fitted into the scheme of the manpower pool

6

for Selective Service.

7

Q

I suppose it is clear that if he were in an auto»

8

mobile accident that cut his leg off,

9

you and the government x^ould agree, would be a circumstance be­

that under the regulation,

10

yond his control that'would clearly affect his status under

11

Selective Service?

12

as an undergraduate in a bona fide college after receiving an

13

induction notice, that would clearly be something within Ms

U

control and would not justify reopening.

13

agreed on those two positions under the regulations?

But if he enro]led as a bona fide student

You would both be

m

A

In both of those cases.

n

Q

And the question is here whether a conscientious

18

objector -- a status of conscientious objection, which by

19

hypothesis crystalized or occurred after the induction notice,

20

falls into the one category or the other?

21

ease is about?

22

A

Is that what this

That is partly what this case is about.

I think

23

that that is the principal controversy at the moment.

24

to me there is another problem here.

23

volving a conscientious objector, if we should conclude that
5

It seems

If this sort of case in­

1

this is not a circumstance within the government’s theory,

that

2

this isn’t the sort of case where this regulation applied,

then

3

perhaps the regulation isn’t authorised by Congress, because

4

Congress has said that nothing in this title shall require a

5

conscientious objector to serve, and the -Q

6
7

What does Congress say about divinity students,

for instance?
i

A

8
8

X am not sure precisely if that is the same pro­

vision, but it tv'ould still be different -- would get to the

10

different point with any other classification other than the

11

conscientious objector could take advantage, as the government

12

suggested, of getting out once he gets in the army, and that

13

would apply to divinity students, 1 suppose, as well.

14

scientious objectors ~~

15
IS

Q

But con­

I am thinking about a person who enro]led in a

divinity school after receiving his induction notice.

Now, the

regulation as it is written would not allow him to -~

?8
19

A

That is true.

That is something over which he

definitely would have control.

29

Q

He would have control,

although the divinity

21

student I thought was expressly exempted by Congress from being

22

i nducted„

23

A

What you are suggesting there I think is that --

24

my emphasis here wasn’t on whether he had control or not,

25

trol of the circumstances.

And perhaps it wouldn’t be

6

con­

1

applicable to the divinity student either.

2

there is a real problem with cutting off any of these late

3

maturing claims.

4

self contemplates a reopening when chs claim is one that

5

couldn't have been made before and over which the man had no

S

control and that is the precise case that we have here.

7

least we have that facially in this application.

8

prima facie case that he had late crystalization of his con­

9

scientious objector beliefs, and additionally has made a prima

10

facie case as conscientious objector, and in that situation we

11

contend there should be a reopening.

12

1 am not sure that

But it seems to me clearly the regulation it­

At

We made a

And I just want to emphasize additionally that if the

13

regulation is read that way, there is no forum for this man.

14

The government at certain points in the brief seems to suggest

15

that he has been dilatory.

16

this is a late maturing claim.

17

before he received the order for reporting for induction be­

18

cause he was not in his conscience and in his mind a conscienti­

19

ous objector at that time.

20

Q

But this isn’t just a late claim,
Be couldn't have made the claim

Well, I gather that there is a good deal of dif­

21

ference of view between you and your brothers on the other

22

side as to whether or not there is a forum for this man.

G**Jt

<50

understood you to say there was no forum whatsoever if you

24

don't prevail in this case, and I understand it from the

25

government's brief that they concede and tell us and advise us
7

1

1

that bis forum would he after induction when he asserts his

2

claim as a conscientious objector in the army and that the army

3

has basically the same standards as does the Selective Service

4

law with respect to conscientious objectors.

5

A

But the difficulty —

6

Q

Have I misunderstood the government's brief?

7

A

I think: you understand it precisely and the dif­

8

ficulty with that position is this Court noted in United States

9

in the Mulloy ease,, in the footnote quotation from United

10

States vs. Freeman, in Footnote 6, they are conscientious ob­

11

jectors, and Mr. Ehlert is one, who cannot submit for induction,

12

so that is the forum they can't reach.

13

any participation --

14

Q

Their objection is to

Except the statute doesn't protect those who can­

15

follow his conscience and not submit to

16

Q

In its words --

17

A

We pointed out —

18

— in. the words that the Congress used.

19

A

We pointed out in our brief, in our closing brie;

20

here that the legislative history on the 1967 act shows that

21

there was originally provision in that act to provide the con­

22

scientious objectors first submitted to induction, and that was

23

specifically removed.

24

this lav;, that there are people who cannot submit at al], and

25

that is what they are talking about.

And the point was made that, based on

I

Q

Has not the military service allowed conscienti­

2

ous objector claims to be made within that framework even after

3

they had been in the combat zone and returned them to the

4

United States to process them?

5

The military will.

Of course,, that is a claim

that matures after you are in the army.

Q

9

There is never a prob­

1 thought that was what Mr. Justice Stewart was

probing at, that there is another remedy available to him.
A

10

But he can't reach the remedy because he can’t

1!

submit to induction, his conscience won't permit him to.

12

even if he did, we are still not sure whether that would be the

13

case because the army regulation is designed to provide a

14

remedy for those who become conscientious objectors after they

15

enter service, and this man became one before the time for in­

16

duction carne»
Q

17

Mr. Halvonllc, I would like to join in Mr.

18

Justice Harlan’s remark, do try to keep your voice up.

hard to hear you over here.

21
22

A

But

Very good.

It is

I shall try again, Mr. Justice

Blackman.
The only argument that I can see --- the government

23

essentially says that circumstances should not mean these kind

24

of circumstances, and I cannot see any reason for that and we

25

have tried to meet that in the brief and I have tried to meet
10

-The only other argument the government has made in

favor of its construction is that it makes for efficiency,

I think that is wrong.

It may result in less burdens on the

In fact,

sometimes they

If the Selective Service System doesn't want to look
at conscientious objector claims at all,

just ignores them all,

10

the local boards won't have any hearings,

n

life easier for them, but that doesn't make them more efficient

12

in their job, because it is their task t© remove from the man­

13

power pool those people Congress says are not to serve, and

14

that is their job.

15

in this regulation promotes their doing their job and promotes

16

the theory that a man such as Ehlert doesn't get to the induc­

17

tion center, doesn't have to refuse and make for efficiency

18

throughout the governmental system because the congressional

19

scheme is to keep conscientious objectors out before that

20

point so that they are not prosecuted and they are not going to

21

jail.

22

the government's theory,

And the construction the petitioner

from the local board —

What would you say if the straight-foivard regu­

all conscientious objector

claims had to be filed before a notice of induction is received'

2

A

Well, that essentially is what the government is

3

saying the regulation says, and I would say that such a regula­

4

tion woulld not be authorized by Congress because it provides

S

because Congress says conscientious objectors shall not be

6

required to submit to be subject to combatant training and

3
9

How, it is quite different from the government regu­
lation that says if you are a conscientious objector before you

10

receive an order to report for induction and you don't tell us

11

until after, that you are cut off, that you slept on your rights

That would raise' some interesting questions, but that is not

I don't see how they can adopt a regulation that

Q

Suppose Congress said when you receive your

order for induction you are inducted?
A

I am not sure I understand.

You mean you don't

22

have to go to a station somewhere, that you are inducted as

23

soon as you receive the order to report for induction?

24

Q

What would happen to this case?

25

A

Well, the difference in that 1 suppose would be
12

!

that his claim wouldn’t have crystalised until he had been in­

2

ducted* after the point of induction, if that were the case,,

3

Then 1 think a forum would still have to be provided for him

4

and the service would provide such a forum.

5

Q

What forum?

6

A

It would have to be in the service because, as

In the service or in the army?

7

you define it, he is already inducted as soon as he gets the

8

notice,

9

Congress would adopt such a system because nobody can refuse

10

But I don't think

to submit to induction under that theory.

n
12

so he is immediately in the army.

Q

Your client would take the position that he

didn’t voluntarily get inducted?

13

A

I think that is

14

Q

Our big problem is this suddenly finding out

15

,probably the case,

yes.

that he can’t take the oath.
A

16

Well*

1 think we find that in all kinds of ex­

17

periences in. life, particularly in those where it is a combin­

18

ation of cognitive faculties, emotional faculties.

19

romantic analogy, I don’t think you can woe yourself into love

20

with somebody, it may come at a moment, and then you can’t

21

detach yourself very easily from if either, even though you

22

rationalise -~

23

Q

To draw a

My point is not that he is a conscientious ob­

24

jector but he can’t even take the oath in order to litigate

25

it.

The advantage of taking the oath is waging war.
13

Is that

i

1

his position?
A

2
3

Well, his position was that be would not submit

to induction, Your Honor.

4

Q

Regardless if nothing happened after that?

5

A

Did anything happen after --

6

Q

Suppose he was inducted and he started his CO

7

proceeding-

8

it was litigated and all, and he couldn't go through that.A

9
10

in the army and he stayed right there in town and

He couldn't become a member of the armed forces,

no.

11

Q

12

A

He just couldn’t?
He just couldn't.

And that is not only Mr.

13

Ehlert, that is a lot of religious sects — a lot of religious

14

sects also adopt that philosophy.

15

Q

Which religious ~~

16

A

Jehovah's Witnesses, as far as I know.

17

Q

Which religious sect says that when you get your

18
19
20

induction notice you don't like war, which sect is that?
A

That is a different point than the one I was

trying to make, Mr, Justice Marshall.

21

Q

Oh, I see.

22

A

I was just saying that there are religious

23

sects that cannot submit to induction.

24

sect that says when you decide at the last moment you don't go

25

to war, that is part of the philosophy, but it does hamper -- I

5

that have adopted the construction we contend for, and that

case involved a Jehovah's Witness, a man not being a Jehovah's

Witness before he received his order to report for induction,

parents and hadn't decided he was a Jehovah’s Witness yet, and

In this content the two circuits faced the ques~

A

Well, that may be but of course the government

not?

7

contended for years that it was an exhaustion of remedies that

8

always occurred there if you didnst go through physicals or

9

something of that nature and so it was ruled as an extension of

10

Selective Service, and both the Second Circuit in Stafford and

11

now the Seventh Circuit in Hordlof have come to the conclusion

12

that they are extensions of the Selective Service System for

13

the purposes of reopenings where changes occur after the notice

14

to report for induction, and that is what is so strange because

15

it happens all the time in physicals, you know, physical exam­

IS

inations are determined down there, even though the application

17

had been made before, it was determined at the Selective

18

Service induction center that the man isn’t physically fit if

19

there has been a change, he is taken out of the

20

a 1-Y or 4-F and is not inducted.

he is given

21

Anyways, I was saying that I don’t think that our

22

construction at all produces any problems as far as the ef­

23

ficiency of the Selective Service is — that the construction

24

that we seek in this regulation would result in Selective

25

Service System doing what its job is and not having
IS

f

conscientious objectors in jails where none of the purposes of

2

penology are served, and on the other side the construction

3

that we seek provides nothing but forum for those who have

4

late maturing claims.

5

that their claim is late maturing under the construction we

6

seek.

7

wouldn't get advantage of the rule we are seeking here.

8

don't foreclose that possibility but as far as Ehlerfc is con­

9

cerned, it was a late maturing claim and we made a prima facie

And one thing we have to establish is

A man who has been dilatory or who slept on his rights
We

10

case and that ought to be enough.

And there is no reason and

11

no suggestion by Congress that conscientious objectors are to

12

be treated differently from other people who are deferred or

13

exempt under the draft, and yet that is what happened if you

14

accept the government's construction, because persons with

15

other sorts of claims, other sorts of changes of status,

16

example somebody becoming the sole surviving son after an

17

order to report for induction, the government concedes that

13

their case can be reopened.

19

the

20

al history is clear that conscientious objectors are supposed

2!

to be given the same sort of treatment as every other person

22

exempted --

23

Q

for

There is no reason to think that

of this case*

23

Let me advert very briefly to the facts as they

On July 24, 1961, the petitioner registered for the

24

draft because he reached age 18.

25

petitioner returned his classification questionnaire to the

5

to report for induction on July 14, 1965.

6

7

mailed the letter to his local draft board stating that he was

3

a conscientious objector.

On April 15,

1964, petitioner was ordered to report
1964.

On June 16, 1965,

One day before the
1965, petitioner

9

The petitioner was tried for violation of the applic­

10

able statute, convicted by the district court, and the judgment

11

was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in a split of 8~to-5 in that

12

court.
The questions raised by the petitioner go to the

13
14

proper interpretation of the regulation, whether the regula­

13

tion as interpreted by the court below ivas consistent with the

13

statute.

17

critical language is that reclassification after mailing of

18

induction notice is cut off in

19

on a claim of ’’change in the registrant's status resulting frost

20
21

circumstances over which the v-ggistrant has no control." Then
y
the regulation as construed by the court below is designed to

22

exclude all post-notice of induction claims subject only to a

23

very narrow exception, and the exception requires two facets?

24

one must meet both facets to corae within the exception.

25

The regulation, as is set forth in the brief, the

all cases unless it is based

The first is that there be a non-volifclonal change,
20

1

and the second is that it foe a change resulting from circum­

2

stances over which the registrant had no control.

3

Mow, there were two

three opinions in fche court

4

below agreeing with fche result of affirmance of fche conviction»

5

Judge Kilkenny, writing the court’s majority opinion, stressed

6

fche volitional nature of a change in conscientious belief.

?

Judge Dunaway, with the concurrence of three of the other

3

judges of fche panel, who also concurred with Judge Kilkenny,

9

stressed fche common sense and dictionary definition of fche

10

word "circumstances" in fche context used in fche regulation,

11

concluding that as used fche term referred to some event ex­

12

ternal or extraneous to fche registrant and therefore that it

13

was unnecessary to engage in fche debate that had gone on be­

14

tween the other circuits which had considered, this matter as

15

fco whether a change in conscience was volitional or not since,

16

regardless of that, such a change was nofc a circumstance as

17

used in those regulations.

IQ

Dunaway relied also on fche serious practical consequences of

19

a contrary construction as expounded by Judge Merrill for the

20

dissenters in reaching the result that fchey did»

Mr. Relinquish, may I ask you a question.

To

1

what extent do you rely on the so-called Department of Defense

2

directive?

3

A

Well, we think it is an important factor in

4

this case, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

5

the DOD regulation, we have checked within the past week with

6

the Office of General Counsel of the Army and received his

7

assurance that this type of claim is not considered on the

8

merits by the Selective Service System? is considered when

9

raised under the Army system.

10

Q

We have not only set forth

Now,

inconsistent.

13

military service based solely on conscientious objection which

19

existed but was not claimed not prior to notice but prior to

20

induction -- is it internally inconsistent?

21

A

It says a request for discharge after entering

If read literally,

I suppose it is.

I think

22

taken in context t^ith the first sentence, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

23

that the focus is notice of induction rather than induction,

24

and that is the interpretation that the General Counsel of the

25

Army places on it.

23

i

Q

It certainly doesn't say that, does it?

2

A

It doesn't say it in so many words, no.

3

As you comment, Mr. Justice Stewart, in the cutting

4

off of a claim for a purely voluntary reason, the case of a

5

teacher who becomes a teacher after notice for induction --

6

now that has been upheld by the Third Circuit this past year

7

in a case called Scott vs. Volatile, which is the same case

0

that in September went the same way as the Second Circuit had

9

gone in Gearey.

So to say, as petitioner does, that we treat

10

conscientious objectors in some invidious way that we don't

ti

treat any other Rind of claims for change in registration

12

just isn't so.

13

Q

Well, it depends really, I think, on whether

14

you accept the proposition that a conscientious objector whose

13

objection crystalled post-induction notice is somebody who

16

comes under the regulation.

17

ferently than you do the man who is hit by an automobile and

18

his leg cut off.

19

fact that he comes under the definition and it is quite right

20

that you treat him no different than you treat a man who goes

21

to divinity school after his notice of induction is sent,

22

isn't that it?

23

A

If he is then you treat him dif­

If, on the other hand, you don't accept the

Yes, and certainly if we treat him contrary to

24

the way the regulation says we should treat him, you don't

25

need any further argument, I suppose, to conclude that we're
24

1

doing wrong by it, but we say the regulation construed per­

2

fectly consistently with its language does cut off not just

3

conscientious objector claims but any claim that may be a

4

result of volition.

things that one may
One may enter the

barred post-induction notice.
So that the unifying theme of the regulation is the

12

notion that not only is volitional move to obtain exemption

13

totally cut off with the mailing of the induction notice, but

14

that any one of those non-volitional types of claims which

15

are capable of ready verification by the local board, con­

16

sisting as it does of laymen meeting irregularly,

17

surviving son exemption, a brother shot down in a plane,

13

something like that that can be verified with a letter or a

19

phone call, is something that can fully be disposed of by the

20

board one way or the other between the time of notice of in­

21

duction and the fcirre of reporting for induction, which as near

22

as I can tell from these cases seems to have run during this

23

period of time from between three and four weeks.

24
25

the sole

A claim to a change in one9s conscience, a change in
conscientious status requiring as it does both the

of whether or not that is a change of the state of mind one

3

held prior to induction is a factual and terrific extraordinary

would have had great difficulty passing on it prior to the time

when he mails it on the day before he is scheduled to report

for induction, he assures the absolute impossibility of the

A

Let me address it right now, if 1 may.

The DOD

4

directive which we cite and the assurance we have from the

5

General Counsel of the Army as of this past week are that a

6

registrant whose claim is not passed upon on its merits

7

rises post-induction notice isn't passed on on the merits by

8

the Selective Service board may be offered and considered under

9

the Army regulations as soon as the registrant is inducted.

10

Q

n

12

A

or

And that would be before any combatant training

My understanding is that as soon as that kind of

13

a claim is made in the Army, the man gets what is in effect a

14

desk job in a situation where he is not further processed into

15

the military system until there has been a disposition one way

16

or the other by his -- of his claim.

17

Q

IS he prevails, he gets discharged?

18

A

If he prevails, he gets discharged.

The peti­

19

tioner claims that since under his view of the statute it con­

20

fers a right of exemption on the conscientious objector and

21

i does expressly authorise any regulation which may limit the

22

time in which that claim can be asserted, but the regulation

23

is here applied by the court below as inconsistent with the

24

statute and therefore unauthorised.
I think this claim proves too much and would cite at

25

27
!

1

least two points in support of that observation.

There is no

2

express statutory authority in &{-)) for barring the assertion

3

of conscientious objector claims which have existed previous

4

to induction notice but haven't been asserted.

5

the courts i^hieh have gone the Gearey route have said that

6

this is a proper function of the regulation, that the man who

7

was always a conscientious objector but fails to assert it

0

until the time he received the induction notice can validly be

9

barred, and yet there is no statutory authority for that.

And yet even

10

is simply the application of a procedural rule that is

1?

thoroughly designed to both permit reasonable processing of

12

these claims and to perpetuate a necessary ultimate cutoff

13

date and changeit.

2

The same section, S(j$ of the act„ that confers the

3

right of conscientious objector exemption, also confers in

4

unqualified terms a right of appeal, and the precise language

5

is this:

10

that the President, under his general authority to promulgate

rules, isn't entitled to set some time limit as in a ruling

13

must be taken to the appeal board.

local board's adverse ruling two years ago when I wasn't a

Surely on the day before

18

So it simply is an overly simplistic, to use an

19

overly used word, construction of the statute to say that

20

because it confers a right of conscientious objection.

21

may be no procedural regulation governing how that right is to

22

be set forth or how it is to be processed.

23

earlier in the colloquy between counsel and, I believe,, Mr.

24

Justice Stewart, if you look at the section sentence by sen­

25

tence the only unqualified right conferred, even if you take
29

There

And as occurred

1

a literal reading, is the right to be exempt from combatant

2

training and service^. the right to be exempt from induction is

3

conferred only upon those who are found by their local boards

4

to be conscientious objectors.
I don't think you can read either one of those

5
§

statute sentences literally to the exclusion of the others.

7

And I think that the overall result that you get from a fair

0

reading of the section is that there is a substantive right of

9

conscientious objection and that reasonable rules are per­

10

missible so long as they serve a legitimate end of the

11

Selective Service System and its administration and don't un­

12

reasonably restrict the right of the conscientious objector

13

claimant to assert his claim in that forum.

Q

14

Are there any figures available, Mr. Rehnquisfc,

15

as to the number of these post-induction notice conscientious

16

objection claims?
A

17

Mr. Justice Harlan, there are, and I regret to

18

say that the Selective Service System in the past year not only

19

may have been guilty of writing ambiguous regulations but has

20

been guilty of not Keeping as much statistical information as

21

it should.

22

What we have is figures for August, September,

23

October and November of 1970, and this is the first time

24

Selective Service nationally began Keeping these figures.

25

During this four-month period there was a total manpower call
30

1

of 42,000.

2

number of registrants who asserted post-notice conscientious

3

objector claims was 2,695.

4

petitioner in his brief that the service will be easily able

5

to adjust to this insignificant insubstantial burden is

6

squarely at odds with these facts.

12

Q

One other thing, Mr. Rehnquisfc, to go back to

13

when 1 asked you about the forum available to a man situated as

14

this petitioner is, and you told us about the Army practice.

16

the Army within the last ten clays or so?

1?

A

Yes.

18

Q

Unless that is confidential or for sowe other

19
20

reason, would you make that available?
A

It certainly isn't confidential, Mr. Justice

21

Stewart, and we will see to it, with the Court's permission, we

22

incorporate that in the same submission in which we incorporate

23

13

A

Whether the affording of the Army forum rather

14

than the local board forum under the circumstances presented

15

here is consistent with the statute and the regulation.
Q

16

different — that there is any difference between the forum,

is there?

19

that.

It is just a question of whether you have to be in­

Well, I should think that he could resort to

habeas corpus.

MR. HALVONIK:

Very good.

If I can also just com­

ment on some initial facts,, which is that these figures

12

referred to post»notice claims.

13

made the distinction between dilatory claims and late maturing

14

claims, and the government has continued throughout this liti­

15

gation to ignore that distinction and apparently it has been

16

gathering statistics, too,

17

the most remarkable thing I found about them was that

18

California is the place where they have the largest number of

19

these claims.

20

York, where Gear ey is the law.

21

it is at least that the rule that the petitioner is asking

22

for does not encourage late claims.

It doesn't seem to have

23

any effect on the number of claims.

They are going to be

24

there anyway and they are going to have to foe dealt with,,

25

and they will have to be dealt with either by prosecutors or

Q

I gather the government isn't now claiming

3

that a gentleman who doesn't present his claim because it

4

matured late isn't going to get his claim heard.

5
6

A

Well, he is not going to be heard if he can't

submit to induction.

The government does admit to that.

7

Q

Oh, yes.

8

A

And let me quote from footnote 6 in Mulloy

9

where this Court said, quoting the Seventh Circuit decision,

10

a sincere claim of conscientious objector status cannot turn

n

to the habeas corpus remedy to challenge the legality of his

12

classification because his religious belief prevents him from

13

accepting induction under any circumstances, the previously

14

recognized principles of this Court.

15

Q

While we are talking about footnotes, I have

16

a question about Footnote 53 in your brief.

17

rather intrigued to find that despite the decision in this

18

very case your client, Mr. Ehlert, you tell us that state

19

headquarters of the Selective Service System in Sacramento,

20

California has what you describe as a procedure for handling

21

conscientious objection claims in the manner urged by you in

22

Footnote 53 on page 28.

23

A

I was pussled and

Is there an explanation for that?

That's true.

We found this particular memo­

24

randum and we used it to demonstrate that it didn't look like

25

things were going to get too disrupted.
37

It wasn't applicable

1

In Ehlerfc's case because of course this occurred before the

2

memorandum was issued.

3

Q

4

This memorandum was promulgated

well after the

decision in this case, wasn't it?

5

A

That's true.

6

Q

Is there any explanation for that?

11

— because the California Selective Service

12

apparently state-wide is- doing exactly what you say the Selective

That's true.
