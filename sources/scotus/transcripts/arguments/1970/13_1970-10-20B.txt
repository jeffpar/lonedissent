Although fche Government i3 apparently

stating that they are not urging that they be permitted to

use this type of electronic gug to obtain statements or con­

fessions of past events® I might point out to the Court that

the effect of a reversal-here might permit just- that® because

20

in the Sixth Circuit just very recently-*-in the Hoffa case—

2%

they have taken fche position that there was no constitutional

violations when fche co-defendant was bugged one day prior to

the return of fche indictment®

MR® WILSON:

8

points in rebuttal»

9

May it please the Court* just a few

One* counsel referred to some of this as being hearsay

10

and I think that that is not a proper application»

11

testimony of the words which constitute an event is not hearsay.

12

I don9t think any hearsay is probably in this case at all,

Any direct

13

The—perhaps the most difficult--one of the most diffi­

14

cult judicial tasks for a court of last resort is the balancing

15

of values which necessarily go into close constitutional

16

decisions»

17

Q

is what?

.18

A

2s the balancing of values which perhaps in

19

interpreting the Constitution—in that regard* I want to point

20

out that radio communication is increasingly a part of police

2i

work.

22

And that is particularly true in these narcotics cases»
A typical narcotics case involves an undercover agent

221

who makes contact»

24

earner* is picked up in a car by sob®one he doesa®t know who

25

takes him around the city and they drive for* maybe* sometimes

To reals© a purchase he goes to a street

4

I

maybe several hours while they try to throw off a tail? they

2

then go to an apartment he didnft know about® and there he

3

meets somebody that he never saw before and negotiates his

4

purchase«

5

narcotics and bring it back®, and tbs proper working of that

©

by the police desk requires radio communication*

7

And usually they have to send out and get the

Xt takes a squad of from 4 to 7 men fco investigate

8

that situation and they have to have communication coming out

9

of the informant who is negotiating a sale,

10

Now0—

11

Q

Sometimes it might have a natter of more than a

12

passing interest to the Government agencies to know whether

13

one of its men was in danger,, too*

14

A

That is exactly right0 Your Honor* because this

IS

is a very dangerous business and—and ©specially for the man

16

who is negotiating the purchase and they need that to insure

17

his safety»

18

In addition**-help insure it—they need it for—to

19

permit the proper timing of the arrest and then they also need

2©

it for—it is very valuable in, following a car.

21

informant has a radio on him they can follow the car at a much

22

greater distance»

23

order to do the tailing®

,24.
25

You can—if an

They don-fc have to get so close to it,, in

And it. protects the potential defendant against the
informant®

In this type of police work the person who negotiates
5

!

i the sale is often an. addict himself and is maybe not the most

2 j reliable person in the world end one of the things that the
! responsible officer wants to know is exactly what is happening
3

i

And so it actually operates to help protect fche—fche
defendant himself against possible—

Q

what of the—position that

they never had an opportunity to cross-examine this ran*

io

12

Mr* Attorney-General*

Well*—»
Is there any explanation in the record as to

why he wasn’t secured?
A

Except—the explanation in the record is that

they looked for him and couldn’t find him*

15

Q

I see*

16

A

There is a disputebetween

us as to thediligence

17

and all that* but there is an explanation that they looked

18

for him and couldn’t find him at the time of the trial,;

19

We would wind up. our presentation here by urging that

20

in considering of—seeing this situation,, that we urge upon

21

the Court that you take info eonsiferation the overall demands

22

of law-enforcement in this situation and if there is to be a

23

balancing of rights lie re as between the person under surveil­

24

lance or under suspicion,, on the narcotics trail, in consider­

25

ing his rights vis-a-vis fell® Government in making that case,,

6

1

to also balance against that the effects of the narcotic tradec

z

and* X would snake a special appeal for the pmg people of

inner cities where—

Q

As part

of 'the constitutional question?
A

it does not* Your Honor* except that you get to

this problem of-*«of a very difficult decision in a close case.»

8
9

Would all that make any difference?

Q

Do -we ever get to a balancing until we find that

there is one right under the Constitution apparently on a

1C

collision course with another right?

11

some right in conflict with the claimed right of the individua 1«

12

That is the only time we have to get fco balancing# isn°t it?

13

A

How do you spell out

Well# that is possibly true* a-M I was thinking

14

in terms of the overall effect of law-enforcement in the

15

narcotics trad—field# and the terrible effect upon the victims«
Q

16

And I suppose if anyone were to suggest a listen­

17

er can511 repeat the conversation he has heard# perhaps oven a

18

First Amendment argument might ha raised about that* an inhibi­
