ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. STONE, ESQ.,
1
OH BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
j

MR. STONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, this criminal tax case which is no on reargument comes

\
]

9
10
11

to this Court on direct appeal from the United! States District
Court for the District of Utah.
The ease presents a situation in which I thin!?, it

12

can be said that both defense counsel and the government agree

13

that the trial court acted arbitrarily and perhaps mistakenly

14

in granting a mistrial.

15

That same judge some months later, apparently

16

recognizing his error in seme way, refused to permit the

17

government to retry the ease on grounds of double jeopardy,

18

and it is upon that decision that the government now appeals.

19

I would hope to devote the bulk of my argument

20

today to the merits of this case, but 1 would like to at the

21

outset address myself very briefly, before stating the facts

22

of this case, to the jurisdictional aspects of this case,

23

that is to the government's right to appeal the trial judge's

24

dismissal on grounds of double jeopardy under section 3731 of

25

title 18 of the United States Code, which is known as the
2

1

Criminal Appeals Act.
I imagine that the Members of this Court remember

2
3

that on argument last term the Court asked government counsel

4

in effect how the government could bring this appeal when

5

section 3731 allows the government to appeal from the granting

S

of a- motion in bar only "when the defendant has not been put

7

in jeopardy," and when in this case the defendant had tech­

8

nically been put in jeopardy at the first aborted trial in the

9

sense that the jury had been empaneled before the trial was

10
11

dismissed.
Q

The factual seating is true,

I suppose,

in most

12

of the mistrial cases we have encountered in the courts in

13

this country,

14

A

isn't it?
That's right, and that is precisely the point

15

I am about to make.

Of course, at the time of the original

10

argument, it was still undecided by this Court whether the

17

phrase "not been put in jeopardy," in. section 3731, meant

18

jeopardy literally or whether it meant jeopardy in the full

19

constitutional sense.

20

tional and the merit questions in a case like this would be

21

essential to the sarnie question.

In other words, whether the jurisdic­

22

And of course that question was decided by this

23

Court at the end of the term in the Sisson case, which was

24

handed down subsequent to the original argument of Jorn.

25

Nov?,

in Sisson,

this Court decided that the Criminal
3

1

Appeals Act forecloses appeal from a motion in bar granted

a

after jeopardy is literally attached.

3

fairly be said that the Court in Sisson placed considerable

4

weight on the government's very candid admission that it had

5

always assumed this restrictive interpretation of the Criminal

6

Appeals Act,

7

Appeals Act restricted the government precisely in this way,

8

and the government had never sought to appeal for motions in

9

bar granted after jeopardy has attached.

the government had always assumed that the Criminal

I think,

10

And I think: it can very

however,

that we can say with equal candor

11

that we had never hesitate to appeal from the granting of a

12

motion in bar in a situation like the present one,

13

situation in which the defendant was placed in literal jeopardy

24

at the first trial under circumstances allowing him constitu­

15

tionally to be tried a second time, but in which the defendant

16

has not been placed in jeopardy at the second trial,

17

at which the motion we are appealing from was qranted.

that is a

the trial

In other words, we have always read the phrase "not

18
19

been put in jeopardy" in section 3731 to refer to jeopardy at

20

the trial at which the motion under consideration was qranted.

21

And,

22

mean that the government could never appeal a dismissal on

23

grounds of double jeopardy subsequent to a mistrial because a

24

mistrial is usually granted after a jury has been empaneled

25

and literal jeopardy has attached.

as the Chief Justice suggested,

4

to hold otherwise would

And this would be so even

1

though the predecessor statute on which section 3731 was based,

2

which I submit was a much more restrictive statute than section

3

3731, and evidence even a greater policy against government

4

appeals in. criminal cases than did section 3731,

5

cessor statute allowed appeals only from special pleas in bar.

6

And the classical and practically the only example of a

7

special plea in bar was a plea of convict or quit, which is

8

the plea of double jeopardy.

9

that prede­

I think even the most restrictive view of the phrase

10

"motion in bar," which was evidenced by Mr. Justice Stewart's

11

opinion in the Mersky case, makes it clear that it is has al­

12

ways been assumed that this was -~ that a plea of double

13

jeopardy was a motion in bar even under the most restrictive

14

definition,

15

section 3731 grounds in this case would be simply to read

16

convict or c^uit, double jeopardy out of the definition of

17

special plea in bar and leave that phrase of the statute

18

totally meaningless.

and to refuse to allow the government to appeal on

And as we state in our supplemental brief on this

19
20

point,

21

which the government was allowed to appeal from an adverse

22

determination of double jeopardy, and I am referring to the

23

Tateo case at 377 U.S.,

24

there was a jurisdictional objection to the appeal.

25

there are at least two cases decided by this Court in

Q

and the Oppenheirner case,

in which

The double jeopardy motion in this cage was
5

1

made before the jury was empaneled in the second trial,, was

2

it?

3

A

That5s right.

4

Now,

I want to state the facts on this very brief

5

record in rather considerable detail.

I don't think it will

S

take very long, because I think it is important to understand

7

exactly what went on in the court room prior to the granting

8

of a mistrial.
We are in the District of Utah, before the Chief

9
10

Judge of that District, Judge Ritter,

and information is filed

11

against Mr. Jorn, who is charged in 25 counts with having

12

prepared false and fraudulent income tax returns for others?,

13

specifically Mr. Jorn was charged with having either invented

14

or grossly exaggerated deductions to which the taxpayers, Mr.

15

Jorn's customers, were not entitled.
The case was called for trial on August 27,

1G

1968,

17

and a jury was selected and sworn during the morning.

18

afternoon the United States Attorney indicated outside of the

19

presence of the jury that he wished to amend the 25-count

information and reduce it down to 11 counts,

hearing that the indictment -- the information was being re­

duced down to 11 counts -- and I quote now from page 34 of

25

the record:

A whole what?

6

me like, " this is the judge addressing the prosecution.

7

add the observation here that this is Judge Ritter”s first

3

remark to counsel in the record, and it illustrates what I

9

think can fairly be described as a consistently hostile atti­

10

x

tude towards this prosecution.
The first witness in the case was a revenue aqent

it
12

who was called simply to identify the returns under consider­

13

ation, and after immediate stipulation that the returns were in

14

fact authentic, the revenue official stepped down and the fi>-st

15

real witness was called, and this witness, who was one of a

16

series of the main government witnesses, was one of the tax­

17

payers for whom Mr. Jorn had allegedly made a fraudulent

18

return.

19

As soon as this witness took the stand, defense

20

counsel, Mr. Morrill, addressed the court as follows, and I

21

am now on page 40 of the record:

22

"in view of the transcript in the preliminary hear­

23

ing in this matter, it is my feeling that each of these tax­

24

payers should be warned as to his constitutional rights before

25

testifying, because 1 feel there is a possibility of a violation
7

1

of the law."

z

witnesses who are about to testify, and the judge responds to

3

that suggestion as follows:

This is defense counsel's suggestion,

as to the

"Well, we want anybody to talk himself into a

4
5

federal penitentiary here,

so what the court has to say to

G

you is this" -- and I will now read the following pages of

7

the record, in which the judge very clearly and emphatically,

8

in what I would call the strongest possible terms, advises the

9

prospective witnesses of their right not to testify for fear

10

of incriminating themselves and of their right to have a

11

lawyer,, -their right to have a lawyer appointed for them,

.

even

12

though they are not criminal defendants, before they testify

13

in this case involving another defendant.
And, incidentally,

14

in spite of the fact that the

15

prosecution had given assurances that the government did not

16

plan to go against the taxpayers.

17

The judge then addresses the witness and says ~-

Q

But you say --

A

Considering the fact that it could have really

been done by continuance of the first trial.

Q

14

But the government was prepared to go ahead

with the second trial?

15

A

16

Oh, yes, the government -- well, the government

17

was prepared to go ahead at the first trial, so it was cer­

18

tainly prepared to go ahead at the second trial.

19

basis of the facts, as I have just recited them, it seems to

20

me that there are basically two ways to interpret what Judge

21

Ritter did in declaring a mistrial.

22
23

To begin with, 1 think it is not unreasonable to
*
,
contend that the declaration of a mistrial was directly at­

24

tributable, a direct consequence of the defense's request on

25

page 40 of the record, that "each of these taxpayers should be
11
!

Now, the

0t

2

warned as to his constitutional rights before testifying."
Now,

1 admit that Judge Ritter took, the bull by the

horns before defense counsel had sufficient opportunity to
4

explain what he had in mind with that request.

5

to elaborate on it.

S

what his exact purpose was.

7

simply that Judge Ritter would warn the taxpayers of their,

8

rights in language sufficiently strong that it would inhibit

9

their testimony, which would be to the benefit of defense

10

Q

12

of the jury?

He didn’t get

Would that have been appropriate in the presence

Oh,

this could have ~~ it could have been done

outside of the presence of the jury.
Q

Well,, would it have been appropriate under any

circumstances?

17

A

I am not sure whether that would not have been

18

appropriate.

19

don't think it would have been appropriate since this would

20

not have cast any particular problem with respect to the de­

21

fendant in the case.

22

would have been prejudiced by the judge's warning of the wit­

23

nesses that they were conceivably implicated in the scheme.

24

That was clearly going to come out from the testimony that was

25

given anyway.

He did it in the presence of the jury anyway.

I

I don’t think the defendant's rights

12

I suppose it would have been better had the iudqe

3

would have been done just as easily that way, but I don't thin id

This

■
■

4

it would have been any sort of prejudicial error, Mr. Chief

5

Justice,

for the judge to have done it like that at the trial.
Now,

6

I suppose defense counsel may in fact have

7

hoped that a recess of some sort would enable the taxpayers to

8

consult with their lawyers or to think more about it, and this

9
10

would have an additional inhibiting effect on their testimony.
i
Or I suppose conceivably defense counsel might have anticipated

11

exactly what happened in this case,

12

declared.

■13

would then refuse to allow a. further trial on grounds of

14

double jeopardy, but that is,

15

either.

All he did

was make a request, and at that point Judge Ritter ran away

20

with the proceedings and no one had much of a chance to make

21

any kind of motion from then on.

22

entirely in the defense's interest that these taxpayers say as

23

little as possible,

24

had that in mind when he requested that something be done to

25

assure them of their right not to testify.

Q

14

A

I don't mean to blame him for it, Mr. Justice

15

Marshall, I mean only to assert that one way to look at this

16

case -- and I am about to go into alternative ground -- one way

17

to look at this case is to say that the request was granted,

18

that the mistrial was a direct consequence of defense counsel's

19

request that some relief be granted in the sense that the de­

20

fendants be given some warning of their right not to testify.

21
22
23

Q

Do you think Judge Ritter would not have done

this if the defendant had kept his mouth shut?
A

I think it is unclear whether he would have

24

done it or not.

I suppose Judge Ritter might have done just

25

anything in this case, but still the defense counsel had his
14

chance to get in there first and he did so.

12

Q

There was?

13

A

It was the result of the preliminary hearing,

14

Mr. Justice Marshall,

15

of its witnesses were not sufficiently -- did not have suf­

16

ficient memories of the events that took place, and it was on

17

the basis of that preliminary hearing that 14 of the 25 counts

18

were dropped, and I think there was ample time

19

Ritter felt especially solicitous of these witnesses and de­

20

fense counsel was especially worried that their testimony

might not be inhibited by any warning,

1 guess the government isn’t suggesting that

the Criminal Appeals Act, isn't now suggesting that the Criminal

unless he can’t be retried?

18

A

You can’t appeal the motion granted at the

19

trial at which the defendant was placed in jeopardy, but we

20

have always thought that you can appeal a motion granted at

21

the subsequent trial in which he has not been put in jeopardy,

22

in spite of the fact that he was in jeopardy at the prior trial.

Y as.

24

A

And that is consistent with our practice, and

25

I think nothing in the Act or this Court's decision in Sisson

dictates otherwise.

I want to go briefly into the alternative

2

ground we have in this case.

case is to assume that not that the mistrial was declared in

4

response to either side's request or motion, but simply that

5

the jury was discharged as a result of Judge Ritter's exces­

6

sively protective attitude toward witnesses, and the question

at this point is whether the prosecution must fail as a result

8

of this judicial arbitrariness even though it is all agreed

The other way to 3ook at this

10

conceivable effort on the part of either the prosecution or the

11

trial judge to harass the defendant or deny him his rights to

12

be tried before that jury.

13

even if this is the view taken of this record,

14

simply a question of whether the burden of Judge Ritter's

15

arbitrariness must fall on the prosecution in spite of lack of

1G

any harassment of the defendant.

17

And I submit to this Court that
that it is

The rationale of the double jeopardy clause in the

18

decisions of this Court do not require such a result.

What the

19

Court has always done in this mistrial situation is to apply a

20

balancing test that is not directly controlled by the dou?ole

21

jeopardy clause,

22

in which the defendant's rights are given very liberal inter­

23

pretation, but in "which in the absence of any indication of

24

harassment of the defendant or excessively unfair aid to the

25

prosecution through mistrial,

it is instead determined by a balancing test

retrial is allowed.
21

1

And I think: this Court's two most recent decisions

2

in the mistrial area illustrate exactly how this Court has

5

But this case,

I submit,

is not like Downum but is,

instead, on all fours with the Gori case, decided by this

Court at 367 U.S.

15

characterised by this Court and the court of appeals as over-

16

eager concern for possible prejudice to the defendant, declared

17

a mistrial because he feared that a line of questioning by the

prosecution was about to result in a prejudicial disclosure of

19

the defendant's prior convictions.

20

defendant in that case neither urged nor acquiesced in the

21

discharge of the jury, but the mistrial was the resu3t of the

judicial arbitrariness.

action of the judge, and I will have to agree with Mr., Stone

9

that from the beginning and one accustomed to practice in

10

this court, Judge Ritter's court, frequently has this happen.

VI

It was apparent from the outset that he did not want this

!2

prosecution to continue, and it is my position, however, that

13

the defendant was entitled to be tried before this jury and

n

any arbitrariness on the part of the judge can't be used as a

55

prejudice to the defendant, that the government must bear the
«

16

17

risk Of his arbitrariness.
Q

If you had gone on with the trial and the

18

judge had not thereafter taken the action he did, I suppose

19

there was nothing to prevent you from taking advantage of the

20

judge's remarks if you went to the court of appeals for a

21

rewiew, nothing to prevent you from claiming that his remarks

22

were prejudicial to your client?

23

A

I suppose that could have been claimed.

I

24

will have to agree candidly with Mr. Stone, I don't think they

25

would have prejudiced my client.

the government at that time, once he decided he was not going

13

witnesses rather than the defendant who actually committed the

but as a fact it was not.
Going to the jurisdictional question again,

16

I be­

17

lieve the legislative history of section 3731, which was dis­

13

cussed by this Court in Sisson, while it is ambiguous in places,

13

indicates that the legislature,

20

Appeals Act, was very concerned that it foe limited strictly to

21

its terms.

22
23
24
25

in passing this Criminal

There are remarks in the legislative history indi­
cating that the -- at least some of the Senators debating this
| bill understood the difference between the attachment of
jeopardy and constitutional double jeopardy.

I think you must

1

separate those two questions because jeopardy attaches and

2

there is nothing unconstitutional about the attachment of

3

jeopardy.

4

is one question.

It attaches every time the jury is sworn.

So that

The Constitution comes into play on a proposed re­

5
6

trial.

Then the motion is that the defendant is being put

7

twice in jeopardy.

8

jeopardy -- and this has been decided recently by four members

9

of this Court in Sisson -- that jeopardy in section 3731 must

10

mean the attachment of jeopardy, not the constitutional stand­

■a

ard, because the Constitution was there and will toe there long

12

before the statute.

It seems to me that if you argtae that

There was no reason for the legislature to incorpor-

15

and they couldn't change what the Constitution means by double

Your Honor,

I don't think Sisson is limited,

I don't think it reads that way.

that once a jury has been empaneled, it doesn't say whether a

20

there was no second jury there, and in fact there was no such

I want to first respond to Justice Brennan's sug­

gestion that perhaps this appeal might have been appropriate

not in this Court but to a court of appeals.

the defense's point -- and I think this really -- the defense

disposition that the Criminal Appeals Act makes ought to be

on our part, have never -thought that it

to that Congress — the Senate was motivated to pass the amend­
