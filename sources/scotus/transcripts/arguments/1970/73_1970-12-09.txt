ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM L. ROBINSON, ESQ.

s

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBINSON:

1

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

@

the Court:

9

to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
The case involves a question of statutory construc­

10

11

This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari

tion of Section 703(a) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The question before the Court is whether Section

12
13

703(a) permits an employer to refuse to hire women with pre­

14

school-age children, while hiring men with pre-school-age

IS

children.
The bona fide occupational, qualifications standard

16
17

or extension under Section 703(e) is not involved in this case.

m

Q

What was that?

19

A

The bona fide occupational qualifications

20

standard, which permits an employer to discriminate on the

21

grounds of status: religion or national origin, if it is a

22

bona fide occupational qualification.

23

this case —

24

Q

That is not involved in

Is this agreed to by both sides, Mr.

Robinson?

A

I don't know whether it's agreed to by both

4

sides, sir, but it. was not raised by the defense below<,

5

will concede, of course, Your Honor, that if the case is

6

reversed and goes to a trial below, they would have the oppor­

7

tunity to

8

raise that defense then .
Q

S

We

At least, am I not correct, the en basic court

made reference to it, at least the dissenters?
A

TO

Yes, the defendant said that the company

I?

should have the right to raise the defense, which we, of course

12

concede.

13

Q

All right..

Q

Could you keep yourvoice

15

A

Yes, sir? I will.

16

Q

Petitioner, Mrs. IdaPhillips,

up a little,

sir?

isthe mother

17

of seven children who range in age from 3 to 15 years, when

?8

she applied for work with Respondent, Martin Marietta Company.
In September of 1966 Petitioner applied for a job

19

20

with Respondent as an assembly trainee, in response to its

21

advertisement of 100 such positions.

22

school diploma, which was the only stated qualification for the

23

job.

24

her for the job because she was a woman with pre-school-age

25

children.

Petitioner had a high-

However, Respondent told her that it would not consider

t

Thereafter, Petitioner filed a timely charge,

z

alleging discrimination because she was a woman with preschool

3

age children with the EEOC.

4

reasonable cause to believe that the refusal to hire her

S

because she was a woman with preschool-age children, constituted

§

a violation of the Act.

The EEOC made a finding of

7

When the Commission was not able to attain volun-

8

tary compliance, the Commission authorised her to file suit,
.

9

which she did.

50
11

After Petitioner filed suit, Respondents filed a
motion to dismiss, which the District Court treated as a motion!
I

12

to strike and struck from Petitioner's claim — Petitioner's

13

complaint those allegations claiming that she was discriminated

14

against because she was — because she had preschool-aged

IS

children.
Thereafter Respondent answered the complaint,

IS
17

admitting that its receptionist told Petitioner she would not

18

be considered because she was a woman with preschool-aged

19

children, but denying that they discriminated against her solely

20

on the grounds of her sex.

.

21

Thereafter, Respondent moved for summary judgment,

22

which motion the District Court granted, based on statistics

23

that approximately 75 percent of the people hired as assembly

24

trainees were women.

23

Q

What was the allegation that they — 'was it
5

I

1

stricken?

2

A

The allegation that she was discriminated

3

against because she had preschool-aged children* leaving

4

standing then* morally the fact that she was discriminated

5

against because she was a woman.

6

The District Court —-

7

Q

What was the theory of striking that —

8

A

The theory of striking that was that as a

9

matter of law discrimination against a person because of their

10

sex-plus — she being a woman with preschool-aged children, did

11

not constitute a violation of the Act.

In ruling on that, the District Court specifically

12

13

said: "The responsibilities of men and women with small

14

children are not the same and employers are entitled to recog­

15

nize those different responsibilities in establishing hiring

16

policies."

17

Q

And you say that is not so?

18

A

1 say that is not so; yes, Your Honor.

19

Q

Does this act reach the government as the

No, Your Honor; it does not reach government

It does, however, reach state employment

I don’t — there might be some question' at some point­

er other whether or not that reaches government employment, but
I don’t think so; no.

Then if the Federal Judge, as a matter of

2

general policy, would decline to' hire law clerk who had an

(Laughter)
Yes, sir, Your Honor.

18

A

19

Petitioner appealed the District Court decision to

20

the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed and rather clearly announced

2,1

a sex=»plus exemption to the act of which we complain here.

22

The court held that a per se violationof the act can only be

23

based solely on one of the categories of the act and that

24

Petitioner had not been subjected to discrimination on the

25

grounds of sex because here there was a two-pronged
7

1

qualification-

a

That iss she was a woman with preschool-aged

children, or in other words, sex-plus.

3

Thus, the lower courts judicially engrafted on the

4

act a further exemption based on sex-plus.

5

this doctrine should be rejected, for several reasons-

6

it conflicts with the basic purpose of Title VII.

7

.

And we submit that
First,

The basic

purpose of Title VII is to ensure that women and other pro­

8

tected categories are not excluded or otherwise hindered in the: ir

9

employment opportunities on the basis of stereotypic assump-

10

tions or prejudgments abouttheir desirability as employees.

11

Rather, the act requires that an employer consider

12

each person on an individual basis or present a bona fide

13

occupational qualifications defense.

14

defense that the statute provides.

This is, of course, the

IS

In this case the lower courts permitted Respondent

16

to exclude Petitioner, based on the unsupported assumption of

17

differences between the normal relationships of working fathers

18

and working mothers to their preschool-aged children.

19

seem that these differences are that the father goes out and

20

works and the mother stays home and takes care of the children.

21

And this, we submit, is exactly the kind of stereotypic assump­

22

tion that Title VII is intended to prohibit.

23

It would

It is, of course, true that many women do indeed

24

stay home to take care of the children-

25

many don’t-

On the other hand,

The point of the statute is that they should be

8

i

treated as individuals rather than as members of the broad

z

category.

3

The second reason, we submit, that the decision

4

below should be reversed is that it conflicts with the language

5

of the act.

G

the policy of refusing to hire women with preschool-aged

7

children, while at the same time hiring men with preschool-aged

8

children.

9

employment practice to fail or refuse to hire or otherwise to

10

discriminate against any individual with respect to his terms,

11

conditions or privileges of employment because of such indi­

12

vidual 9 s sex."

13

Section 703 on its face, would, seem to prohibit

The act declares that "It shall be an unlawful

The Court of Appeals attempted to avoid this plain

14

language if the act by asserting that the act only prohibits

15

discrimination based solely on one of the categories.

However,

16

the Senate, by roll call vote, specifically rejected an amend­

17

ment which would have inserted before each of the enumerations

18

in the act, the ward,

19

ment, Senator Case, onecf the joint floor managers said that

20

such an addition would completely vitiate the acfc»

-

23

"solely."

In speaking against that amend­

And the sex-plus doctrine enunciated by the courts
below in this case, clearly illustrates why that is so.
Restricting the sex-plus doctrine just to the notion

24

of women with preschool-aged children it would exclude, based

25

on a recent study done by the Department of Labor, 4.2 million
9

1

women currently in the labor force under protection of the act,

2

and allow solely on file grounds that they are women with pre­

3

school aged children* their employers to discriminate against

4

them*

3

This would go far toward vitiating the act* but

6

of course* the sex-plus doctrine can easily be extended just as

7

to women*

S

status or sex-plus an age requirement, i.e;, refuse to hire

For example: an employer could* under this act*

10

women who are 28"years of age or overs or refuse to hire women

who are over 32«

12

Thirdly* if the act permits discrimination on the

13

basis of sex-plus it would also permit discrimination on the

14

basis of race-plus, religion-plus or nationality-plus.

example* an employer could then refuse to hire Negroes with

16

kinky hair or on the other hand* Negroes with straight hair»

It would not follow automatically /"'but it is

certainly a logical, rational application of the very doctrine—

doctrine?

25

Do you think that would -follow automatically

For

No; I donefe think so at all*

The doctrine,

| itself, that is a factor, one of the enumerated categories,

plus another factor, is exactly the doctrine announced by the

Fifth Circuit,,

The Fifth Circuit did note ~ and this might

determine whether or not there is discrimination»

6

that that is now a substantial qualification to the blanket

7

doctrine.

8

Q

I

1 suggest

The blanket doctrine of sex-plus removes the
seemingly — the case of discrimination on its face, from the

10

act and I think that for the reasons I have stated before,

11

directly contrary to the intent of the statute and the language

12

of the act, Congress engrafted the exception that it saw fit

13

to put onto the act»

14

face, discriminates against one of the enumerated categories,

15

then the initial inquiry should end right there»

16

Q

And when there is something which, on its

refusing to hire expect,ant mothers, although he «fees hire ex­

Just based on that statement. Your Honor?

But, by the —

A

Yesj that violates Title VII»

23

Q

That's — there are soma things that only

24
25

Women who are pregnant, in other words»

’women can do.
(Laughter)

11

Of course --

No»

•

5

A

That;, of coarse is correct, Your Honor.

No»

2

If he wanted to refuse to hire women who are pregnant, or on

3

the basis of any other physical disability that has to. do with

4

sex, he could present his bona fide occupational qualifications,

5

but if, indeed, women who are pregnant can adequately perform

®

his job, there is really no reason why he ought to be permitted

7

8
9

to exclude them.
Q

But he can't have that rule just because he

doesn't want to take the risk?

10

A

Noa

11

Q

What if his history showed that there were

12

17

considerable risks.
A

Would that be a justification, then?

If he raises the bona fide occupational quali­

fications defense and meets -the standards that the courts have
announced with respect to utilising that defense? yes, he could
successfully defend the case of discrimination.
use those as a prejudgment.

But, he cannot

Q

Could he have, on the occupational section of

the statute, could he have aft announced policy under this act
that he would not hire either an expectant mother or a woman
for six months after her last child was born?

Is there a

rational basis for that?
A

There might be, Your Honor? I don't know.
12

t

But* doctrinally, it is exactly this case.

It's sex-plus.

And Congress has

Do you see any possible problems “of equal

government on the one hand, where they could not, on the Fifth

17

A

No.

I hadn't thought of this problem to date,

18

Your Honor, and I don't see that it's a problem at all.

19

don't even understand the suggestion.

20

however, that the 14th and the Fifth Amendments to the constitu-■

21

tion cover government employment and it prohibit the govern­

22

ment from discriminating in its employment.

23

I

But, I would note,

Also, there are varous regulations which the govern­

24

ment has promulgated which prohibits discrimination in govern­

25

mental employment? specifically: rules administered by the

13

i

Civil Service Commission and —

2

Q

Well# the are you suggesting that perhaps

3

Federal Judges# for example# could not have such a rule as I

4

suggested?
A

3
6

Oh, I am suggesting that# but they would not

be based on the act? it would be based on the Fifth Amendment»
In addition to the statutory intent and the plain

7
8

language of the act# we also point out that the EEOC has issued

9

regulations which prohibit an employer from disqualifying

to

women with preschool-aged children on the grounds of sex-plus»

11

The court below rejected these regulations by the EEOC»

12

suggest that it would be appropriate for this Court# should it

13

see fit to reverse# to remind the Circuit Court that agencies

$4

encharged with the interpretation and implementation of statutes

15

such as Title VII# are entitled to deference? that their

16

regulations are entitled to deference and that their expertise

should be given great weight,

That would be the consequence of a

Q

If you prevail that would foe the result?

25

A

Yes.

And again? we know? of course? that all
15

!

we are thereby doing is instructing the court below that should

2

it find, after a record, has been made, that the company

3

indeed, refused to consider women with preschool-aged children

4

while at the same time hiring men with preschoo 1 - aged children.

5

And there was no defense of bona fide occupational qualifica­

Q

No what?

A

Then — there was no defense on the bona fide

Then the court below must find discrimination, con­
trary to the act.

11

On the other hand, if his distinction is on the

12

grounds that women think they cannot do the job and he can

prove that as a defense under the bona fide occupational quali­

IS

Q

Could he — would he be permitted to try to

defend for the ditch digging on the grounds that women just

18

can't dig ditches as well as men?

19

A

Yes, he would. Your Honor.

20

Q

He would?

He can make that defense; yes.

He cannot,

however, contend that he just doesn't think it's proper for

Q

Wasn't it quite late in the —

16

A

Yes, it was; it was quite late.

But, Your

17

Honor, we must remember that when Congress wrote the statute

18

they included sex in the statute just as they included race,

I think in interpreting this

time for rebuttal, I would like to say that Title VII is one of

a number of Congressional acts which seek to eliminate

Title VII seeks

to prohibit employment policies based on stereotypic assump*

The act provides a narrow exception not raised in

Mow, in our view, the court below erred in holding

16
17

that what had been alleged and assumed here was not a discrim­

18

ination on the basis of sex? it was a qualification for employ­

19

ment, applying to members of one sex and not the other and

20

therefore, on its face, which is all we have here — there is

21

no attempt to justify it — -the requirement is no less a for­

22

bidden discrimination than would be a state voting qualifies-

Q

Could an airline decide that it only wanted

have the job position of steward?

There is litigation about that in the lower

courts now as to whether they have been able to establish a
defense under the act*, under the bona fide occupational quali­
fication defense.
Q

Q

Has the Commission taken a position on that,

on the stewards and stewardesses?
A

I couldn’t say with authority.

My belief is

11

that the Commission has opposed that discrimination, but I

12

couldn’t say for sure.

13

Q

And that is in litigation, you say?

14

A

I have an affirmative nod from one of the

15

Commission lawyers that the Commission has been opposing that

16

discrimination.

17

Q

What Commission?

A

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

(Laughter)

4

Not only has the Fifth Circuit, in our view, backed

5

away from the rationale of this decision but, as we read its

6

brief in this court the Respondent does not itself contend

7

that the broad holding of the court below should b® sustained

8

on the merits and it suggests, instead, that a more fully de­

9

veloped record might show that its refusal to hire the

10

Petitioner did not violate Title VII.

f1

Well, it seems plain to us that what prevented de­

12

velopment of the record was the erroneous grant ting of the

13

summary judgment prematurely, and that a reversal and remand

14

of the case

15

comment briefly on how some of the Respondent's suggestions

16

17

are called for and on that premise I8d like to

about development of the record' seemed to us to bear on the
issues to be resolved on a remand.
One suggestion is that what the receptionist told this

18
19

Petitioner may not have accurately reflected the company's

20

policies,

21

junction should be granted or what the terms of the injunction

22

should be, but it would not, in our view., be a defense to the

23

charge of . discrimination against Petitioner herself.

24

right to relief under the act should not depend on whether

25

there had been a pattern or general practice of discrimination.

Wow, that possibility might effect whether an in­

28

Her

1

Section 703 of the act, which is set out in our

2

brief on page 2? on which she relies? specifically forbids

3

discrimination ig&inst "any individual?" on account of sex.

4

And if that prohibition is to be effective? employers must be

5

held responsible for the acts of their agents who have apparent

©

authority to reject employment applicants.

7

Petitioner's only contact was with the receptionist?

8

there was no other spokesman of company policy for her and the

9

company never undertook to rescind the receptionist's rejec­

10

tion

fi

her employment application.

"

So? *th© practical? sensible way to apply the

12

statute? in our view? if? to look at the situation realistically

13

from the standpoint of the person upon whom the statute confers

14

the right not to be discriminated against and that is precisely

15

What this Court did in applying a similar right not to be dis­

16

criminated against under the Interstate Commerce Act in

17

Boynton against Virginia? in 1362 U.S.
The Court there held that there was a statutory

18
19

right to nondiscriminatory service in a bus terminal restaurant

20

even though the record did not show whether the restaurant ’was

21

owned or controlled by a carrier.

22

terminal restaurant operated as an integral part of the carrier Ss

23

transportation service for interstate passengers and in those

24

circumstances the Court said? "An Interstate passenger need

25

:

It was enough that the

not inquire into documents of title or contractual arrangements

29

!

in order to determine whether he had a right, to be served

2

wi fchout die crimination„"
And it seems to us the same general approach should

3
4

be applied here.

i

Mow* Respondent’s other suggestion that there may,

6

in fact, be no disparity in its treatment of men and women or

7

that whatever disparity exists may be justifiable, raised

8

somewhat more comolex issues .

0

n&t

We recognize that the act does

prohibit discrimination between parents and nonparents or

10

between married and single persons, so long as -those discrim­

11

inations fall equally oh persons of both sexes and of all races,

12

religions and nationalities.

13

But, the Commission and the Government have conten­

14

ded with some success in the lower courts that when -the burden

IS

of a discrimination, based on a nonstatutory factor — one of

16

these so-called '“neutral" factors, such as seniority or educa­

17

tional background, in fact, fall substantially more heavily on

18

persons of a particular race or sex, at Cetera, the discrimina­

19

tion is prohibited unless it is justified by reasons of busi­

20

ness necessity.

21

Now, that is the issue to be explored in the case of

22

Griggs against Dulse Power Company, Number 124, which will be

23

argued in a few days in which we have also filed a brief.

24
25

The Commission has been reluctant, however, to see
that approach and that possible justification extended to
30

discriminations applied directly to the categories of persons

2

specified in the act, such as discriminations between men and

3

women»

Now, on the other

hand, the act itself in Section

5

703 C©) which is quoted in our brief , the bona fide occupational

provision, expressly authorises the restriction of certain jobs

to persons of a particular religion, sex or national origin,

8

although not, interestingly, persons of a particular race, in

9

instances where this is reasonably necessary to the normal

10

optsration ©f the business»
The legislative history indicates that this excep­

very heavily in the training of personnel for that particular

job and that the great majority or substantially all of the

reasonable attendance or.other requirements for the job.

12

the result reached by toe District Court and toe judgment of the

13

Court of Appeals which affirmed it.

14

mentary* of course* that a correct decision shouldn't be

15

reversed simply because it may have been reached through an

16

avenue of erroneous reasoning.

17

We consider if to be ele­

We would suppose that a court reviewing a correct

judgment with-*an. incorrect opinion* might have a duty to

19

enunciate the appropriate reasons for the decision while

20

affirming the judgment itself.

21

22
23
24
25

.« The facts in this case simply do not justify escala­
tion into a cause celebre.

The Petitioner and her anarchy have

invited this Court to decide far more than is necessary for an
appropriate disposition of this case.

There is but a single

issue and the resolution of this can appropriately determine

36

1

the question of affirmance or reversal of the judgment of the

2

Court below®

3

obviously whether the District CourtSs order for summary judg­

4

ment in favor of the Respondent was correct.

5

of course, to the determination of that question is a review of

6

the framework of the record upon which the District Court’s

7

summary judgment order was entered.

And essential,

The essence of this Petitioner’s complaint or efforts

8
9

That question is, of course, very simply and

to charge the Respondent with a violation of her rights under

10

Section 703(a) appears in the two sentences where she said first

11

that when she gave her application to the receptionist, she

12

was told

3

14
5

she, a woman, was told that her application —-■ that

the defendant was not considering applications from women with
preschool-age children.
She followed this by the general and rather conclus­

IS

ionary charge that the defendant refused to employ her solely

17

on account of her sex.

8

Now, we think, it appropriate to observe here it would

19

be difficult to imagine a more normal or natural term for a

20

receptionist to use in addressing herself to the 'Petitioner', who

21

was a woman, than to use the word "women," in speaking f© her,

22

diluting any innuendo which it otherwise might have had.

23
24
25

Now,the Petitioner annexed to her complaint a copy
of -the decision of the EEOC which made no finding or affirmative
assertion that the Respondents treated women with preschool-age

children differently than it treated men similarly situated»

2

In fact* it twice referred to the Respondent’s npnconsideration

Q

10

Would' you want us to decide this case on an

1!

assumption that perhaps Martin Marietta refuses to hire men

12

with preschool-aged children,
A

13

We think, Your Honor, that the record in this

14

case does not show that it did not and it does not show that it

15

treated women with preschool-aged children any differently than

16

it treated men with preschool-aged children and that there was

17

nothing in the record before the District Court to enable him tc

18

rule otherwise than the way he did,
Q

19

20

was the rule of the company?
A

21

22
23
24
25

Do you deny that what the receptionist said

We have admitted, Mr, Justice Marshall, in

our answer that the receptionist made the statement that was
alleged.

There has been, you might say apropos to the Justice's

inquiry, there was, as we would develop in the recounting of the
record, a request for an admission was filed shortly before
38

1

just a few days before the hearing on the motion for summary

2

judgment, in which the Petitioner requested that we admit that

3

we — now this was some two years later — that we — that it

4

now employs men with preschool-aged children.

5

Now, aside from the irrelevancy of the time periods

6

involved, because two — the relevant time of the application

7

was some two years prior and the request says now — aside from

8

that however, the time for responding had not expired at the

9

time of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment.

We can

10

advise the Court in all candor that the answer to it, if we

11

have answered it, would have been yes.
But, also that if they had asked whether we hired

12
13

women with preschool-aged children for the same job at the same

14

job the answer would likewise have been yes.

15

Q

16

A

The policy was exactly the same at that time.

17

Q

Well, why did the receptionist say what she

IS

said?

Is there any explanation in the record for that?

19

20

You mean you have changed the policy?

A

There is no explanation in the record for that,

Q

Well, would it be fair to assume that when the

Your Honor.

21

22

receptionist said, "We don't hire women with preschool-aged

23

children," in preference to saying, "We don't hire people with

24

preschool children," that she meant women?

25

assumption?

Is that a correct

We think, Your Honor, that it was a perfectly

So, then do I understand that you would

agree that if, regardless of all of these good faith efforts,

if and regardless of what the company’s policy was, if regard­

5

less of all of those things, if this woman, in fact, was, her

6

application was refused consideration because she was a woman

with preschool-aged

hiring men with preschool-aged children and then her individual

@

rights were violated under the act.

10

Do you concede that, or

don’t you?

It
12
13

A

Well, not, Your Honor, unless —

Q

Because I. understood you to say that you

virtually concede that the rationale of the Court of Appeals

14

was in error,

16

Right,

Not-unless if it were considered it

were a — shall we say ~ a per se violation, and unfortunately

Unless the comparison were made with men similarly

19

situated with similar custodial problems.

20

Although the record

doesn’t show what the status of Ida Phillips was, with respect

21

to custodial problems, the record shows nothing on that.

Well,

22
we don’t know whafc the term "with preschool-aged children"

Now, perhaps in common experience we might assume it

I would infer, perhaps for soma practical reason you don’t

want to publicly agree with me and I don’t expect you to, but

the inference I got from your argument is that you pretty well

aside and the case remanded for a trial on the merits.
A

We think, Your Honor, that there is more than

one way to develop — that is a way to develop a fuller record»
We think, however, that the record as it stood before the
District Court, where there were two questions before it at that
time, in the framework within which the record had been con­
structed, where the Petitioner had elected to stand on the per
se issue and not to produce any f^areterveiling affidavits or to
introduce into the record anything to show any discrimination
or to show that men similarly situated with her custodial situa­
tion were treated differently than she., since she elected to
43

I

stand on the per se issue, had left the court ~ the District

2

Court, with no alternative but to enter a summary judgment

3

the record as it stood at that time.

4

Q

on

Are you saying that we've got to view this

5

record just as though it had evidence or allegations that men

6

who have preschool-aged children with no mother home to take

7

care of them — in other words, where the man has the same

8

custodial and supervisory role as the wife — would not be

9

hired?

W

That seems to me what your position adds up to»
A

First of all, Mr, Chief Jus&ce, I wouldn't

11

pretend to tell this Court what it must, how it must view this

12

case,but I am not certain that I uh£s>rstan& ■—

13

Q

Well, you make an argument that there is no

14

showing on this record, this admittedly limited record, that

15

men were not treated the same way if they had custodial care of

IS

children at home and that, therefore, the record is sufficient

17

to 'support the District Judge's findings without more?

IS

A

We would say, Your Honor,

that the fact that

1®

it does not at first — there is no affirmative showing in the

20

record —- that there was any difference in the treatment..

21

Simply to say that we are not going to hire preschool-aged ~

22

women with preschool-aged children without being coupled with a

23

comparison of the treatment of men similarly situated, does not

24

constitute an allegation of violation under the act.

7

no reason why the husband should'*

9

Do you think you would

have any defense byshowing by statistics or by anything else,

10

that, the practice of not hiring mothers of preschool-aged

children was necessary to carry on your business in an orderly

12

fashion, or would you attempt that?

ought to have that chance?

Are you saying that you

time.

19

I may say, however, that as a sort of an aside to

20

Mr. Justice Black’s query, that there are governmentslly pub­

21

lished statistics which show that women with preschool-aged

22

children have a higher incidence of absenteeism —

23

offer that as a defense or is it an automatic tiling that without
regard to business or anything else you have just got to hire

A

If the Court please# we feel that our position

that really affords the basis of speculating on what we might

be able to do at 'that time —

I thought maybe you were putting up as a

defense# and hoped to put up as a defense that the rule is a

8

good one; from a business standpoint it can throw the business

out of shape and out of kilter and that you want the chance to

prove it# by statistics or whatever you can and that9s a

reasonable rule.

that again something that I would take judicial notice of, from

many years of contact with industry, that women are manually

MR» ROBINSON:

Thank you, sir.

I think we will only

I merely want to point out a couple of -things. First,
I agree with Mr. Senterfitt that the record is very cloudy, but

23

I suggest that we cannot simply accept, on tin® basis of this

with the material proposition of law in this case.

As a matter of law it had nothing to do

It squarely puts the legal issue and should give us

men with preschool-age children and women with preschool-age

8

children»

Q

Oh, I see»

10

A

And that*a what squarely puts

11

Honor»

12

that legal theory below»

13

Q

It means that we

the issue, Your

should have an opportunity to develop»

And you were suggesting, Mr» Robinson, that

14

it wouldn't be enough as a defense for the employer to show

15

statistical data indicating a significantly higher absentee

16

rate or accident rate for women with preschool-aged children as

17

distinguished from other men and women?

18

A

With preschool-aged children»

19

Q

Well, all right, particularly as distinguished

20
21

Unless ---

from men with preschool-aged children»
A

Yes»

Particularly, that is, unless the company

22

can also show that the normal operation of their business pro­

23

hibits them from absorbing that rate of absenteeism»

24

merely that there-was a difference, Your Honor? it's that there

25

is a difference which is necessary ~

54

It's not

1

Q

Would have a significant impact on their

business operation such as 'that of an assembly line operation

is significantly hurt by absenteeism,

4

A

Not significantly hurt? can no longer be

normally operated.

this exception to be applied,

Q

That’s the narrow way* that Congress intended

Well, that's rather collateral to the basic

issue in this case? isn't - it?

9

A

It is,

10

Q

Do I understand that all you are asking is

11

that this case be reversed because of an error in rendering

12

summary judgment in this case?

13
14

IS

A

Granting the motion to strike and summary

judgment? yes, sir,
Q

Mr, Robinson, I suppose &s a practical matter,

16

if this case goes back, would it be your guess it will be de­

17

veloped on the proviso or exception; in the statute?

IS

A

I don’t know, Your Honor,

I, frankly, would

19

rather doubt it, because I would imagine that the company’s

20

admitting here today that they already hire women with preschool-

21

age children, that they are not going to seek to demonstrate

22

that woman with, preschool-age children can’t do the job,

23

Q

Well, 1 think there have been intimations to

24

the contrary, though,

and ray guess is that if it goes back good

25

lawyers will try to zero in on that one and we will have an

55

1

entirely different case when it comes back here»
