On BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. PACHOSs

If 1 may just respond to Justice Whitens question of

Thank you, Mr* Chief Justice.

I

10

suspect some members of the Court may already know -- there is.,

11

in fact, a certain, statute in Georgia, there is indeed a con­

12

stitutional provision that ©ays that laws shall not have retro­

13

active effect.
If I might quote from a typical esse, and there are

14
15

a number of cases that make very clear that in our case Mrs.

16

Sanks and Mrs. Monan will be subjected fc© double damages.

a typical case, language in a typical case says laws prescribed

A

That is Anthony Vs. Penn,, 212 Georgia 292.

The statutory provision is the Constitutio», which is part of'

the Georgia Code and is cited as Georgia Code Annotated 2-302.

The statutory prevision that says "3aws prescribed only for the

because the substantive issues haven't been raised yet.

Then why doesn't the new statute control this

How can there be a procedure for him to collect

double rent from you when you haven't even got fc© that phase of

18

the law suit yet?

1©

A

Well, 1 suspect ~~ it seems to me that the

20

logical answer is that the ease was filed before this new

21

statute took effect, and that is the time at which he demanded,

22

the landlord sought to have his rights vindicated.

23

Q

Well,

aren’t we really swimming in s dark

Inasmuch as the landlord-tenant relationship is

itself*

the answer may sometimes be found in the contract

But what if the contract is silent?
Over 240 years ago,

3

the General Assembly of Georgia

4

hit upon one solution to the problem*

5

reasonable way of protecting the landlord's interest and still

6

allowing the tenant to remain in possession would be to require

7

the tenant to post: bond as a condition of continued possession*
Statutes dealing with the subject matter of the

3
3

It decided that one

contract,

of course, are traditionally deemed to be incor­

10

porated into and made a part of the contract.

For this reason,

11

it has been understood in the State of Georgia for over 140

12

years that if there is no stipulation to the contrary,

13

landlord is entitled to rely upon the state's statutory dis­

14

possession procedures.

the

15

I wish to emphasise at the very outset that the

16

statutory procedure which appellants attack: is a procedure

1?

which they in fact contractually agree to.

18

could well be decided on this point without even reaching the

19

constitutional i.ssues involved.

20

I think the case

Now» in their brief appellants attack Georgia's

21

dispossession procedures under both the equal protection and

22

due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

23

Padnos indicated yesterday that he was less intrigued currently

24

by equal protection and due process.

25

he has wholly abandoned equal protection and,
12

Now, Mr.

I do not understand that
therefore,

I

1

feel I must comment upon both*

2

It is true, of course, that these two provisions

S

often overlap, but they are not identical.

Because I believe

4

that the questions raised under each of the two clauses are

5

quite different in this case, I would proceed to discuss them

6

separately rather than together.

7

Looking first at equal protection, I think it is

8

rather obvious that to have Intel]igenfc, or I even dare say

9

intelligible conversation on equal protection, one must first

10

define what sort of equality one is talking about.

11

two types of equalty.

12

The first is equality of treatment.

There are

The second is

13

equality of result.

14

simple reason that the existence of one almost always negates

15

the existence of the other.

1®

I might refer to tuition charges at State University.

The distinction is quite critical for the

To illustrate the incompatibility,

Ordinarily, the fee is uniform, at least for state

17
IS

residents.

19

treated alike.

20

produce an inequality of result respecting the ability of in­

2!

digent and, affluent students to enroll in the university.

22

This is equality in treatment.

All students are

Yet this very equality of treatment could

If, on the other hand, the word "indigent" could

23

somehow be classified and students falling within the classi­

24

fication were permitted to attend the university tuition-free,

25

there would obviously be at least a movement toward equality
13

1

of result.

2

equality in treatment.

This would require, of course, a total absence of

I suppose what would follow would be suits progres­

3
4

sively by students just outside the classification of indigency

5

until ultimately maybe everyone would go free.
For reasons which ought to be obvious, it is equality

6
7

of treatment rather than equality of result which prevails in

8

the legislatures and in the courts.

9

utility charges, public transportation, and admission fees

We see this in public

10

and charges for public accommodations generally.

These fees

11

do not vary according to the pocketbook of the consumer.

12

taxes, excise taxes and automobile license plates fall upon

13

rich and poor alike.

Sales

14

Theft is not excusable because the thief is indi­

15

gent and therefore is under a greater pressure to steal than

16

the person of means.

17

the authorities to date are rather uniform in holding that the

18

great number of bonds, both in the federal system and in the

19

state system, which are required in some situations as a con­

20

dition of holding office and other situations as a condition

21

of access to courts, are not to be pushed aside or enforced

22

according to the economic means of the person required to post

23

the bond.

24
25

And as we think we show in our brief,

It is this traditional test which the Supreme Court
of Georgia applied in the case at bar.
14

Having adopted the

I

equality of treatment view of the Fourteenth Amendment* the

2

Georgia Supreme Court could hardly have concluded other than

3

that there was simply no classification based upon economic

4

means which existed.

5

was that of being a. tenant which*

0

had nothing to do with economic status.

7

The sole classification which did exist
like that of being student*

Since this test negates the existence of the indi­

8

gency classification upon which appellants chiefly rely in

9

their equal protection argument, we feel they simply have no

10

equal protection argument at all.

11

would be different if this Court were to construe the Fourteenti

n

Amendment as requiring equality of result rather than of treat­

13

ment..

14

The result* of course,

If equality result is the constitutional goal* there

15

will have to be inequality of treatment.

IS

the Constitution would presumably require a sliding scale for

17

bonds* bail* tuition and all other fees.

18

the individuals economic means would have to be very care­

19

fully scrutinized to achieve as equal a result as possible.

29

Under this approach*

In each instance*

Carried to its natural conclusion, I suppose that

21

the equality of result test would require the

22

of all differences attributable to economic circumstance.

23

not from each according to his ability, we would at least

24

have to reach according to his needs.

25

leveling

I think it is not surprising that the courts,
15

If

like

1

the legislatures, have been reluctant to so convert the equal

2

protection clause into a socialist manifesto.

3

result approaches have been very sparingly used by the legis­

4

latures.

5

various welfare programs, and some educational programs which

6

are specifically designed to alleva te the condition of the

7

poor .

One example might be progressive income tax? another

9

Equality of

An arguably judicial example would be this Court’s
line of cases, starting in Griffin vs. Illinois, which hold

10

that indigent prisoners must be given the same apparent

11

remedies sis are given to those prisoners who are not indigent.

12

I say arguablye because, quite candidly, I real ly believe

13

that the underlying rationale of these cases is not equal pro­

14

tection but is due process.

15

One of the difficulties of the equality of result

16

approach is that it would require highly subjective and per­

17

sonal evaluations, with fine spun distinctions.

18

of course, true of the equality of treatment approach.

19

is a traditional approach which is susceptible ©£ an objec­

20

would have to say also, in mat>y of these eases the two have

analysed separately.

Q

But 1 would classify it as due process.

And you would take this -*• 1 don’t mean to

5

load you down with another case -- but you would take the same

approach in the case which preceeded it?
A

7

1 would say that the only -- in my own judg­

8

ment, the only substantial constitutional issue in that case

©

is due process,
Q

10

11

And you would probably have the same -- come

out with the same result there as you argue in your case?
A

12

Not necessarily.

That is a due process ques­

13

tion.

14

requires the balancing of interests, and X don't know if the

15

Your situation is that she just hasn91 been sued

A

Well*sir* she has been sued for double damages.

You see* it is only one procedure.
29

The procedure that was

1

begun that led to this case is a procedure for possession and

2

double damages, so she is liable for double damages, and the

3

only way she can make a defensa against that in the event that

4

305 is left standing is t© go in and post the double bend.

You mean you are showing that there is?

21

A

well, we have cases in the brief fc© that effect.

22

We say very clearly, in the supplemental brief we filed,

23

the Georgia Supreme Court says very clearly that all they need

not enough -- voluntarily, is not enough to relieve him of
