ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
This case is here on writ of certiorari from the

12

United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which

13

affirmed the judgment for the United States District Court for

14

the Southern District of West Virginia without an opinion.

IS

But, I might add, theses was a dissenting opinion by Judges

1G

Sobeloff and Winter, which

17

their view, was the reasoning of the position of the majority

18

wh^ did not write an ©pinion.

»

19

at some length set forth what, in

There have been a number of changes in the law anc

20

the circumstances of petitioners sines this case was filed.

21

And the Federal Respondent suggest in their brief that while

22

"The case is technically not moot” it would be inappropriate

23

for this Court to adjudicate the complex issues originally

24

raised by this case.

25

Q

That is the position of the United States

How many do not —

A

2

Q

A. handful being what?

3

A

Half dozen.

4

Q

What was it at the time theease got here?

S

A

How many were there at the time the case

6

was filed?

There are perhaps just a handful there.

Our position is

—

Approximately 300.

7

Q

8

A

Thread-hundred.
Our position is that the changes in the

9

facts and the change.? in the law determine only the form of the

10

remedy and -that a court ©f equity has the historic flexibility >

11

that equity has demonstrated to adapt relief to the circum­

12

stances*

13

whether rights were violated and whether petitioners were en­

14

titled to any remedy at all.

15

But the changes have no bearing whatsoever on

The decision may have a practical effect on the

16

rights of the 300 former residents of the Triangle, whom I

17

just referred to in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan’s question,

18

and as the brief of amicus National Housing and Economic

19

Development Law Project states: perhaps 100,000 others through­

2©

out the nation who are similarly situated.

21

22
23
24
25

Now, 1 would like to describe the principal
changes that have taken place since the case was filed.

The

case involves an interstate highway being built through an
area known as the Triangle, a poor, mostly Black section of
Charleston, West Virginia.
3

1

In 1,968 when the case was filed there existed*

2

but since then has recently been repealed* the 1968 Relocation

3

Amendments of the Federal Aid Highway Act.

4

is set forth completely in our brief but Section 502* which is

5

one of -the key sections of the statute* says that*

6

Secretary shall not

7

placement unless he receives satisfactory assurances from the

8

State Highway Department that relocation* meaning certain

9

standards with regard to safety* sanitation and decency will
b© furnished parsons being displaced.

1!

statute relocation is provided for.
Q

"The

pprove any project which will cause dis-

10

12

And that statute

And elsewhere in the

Did you say that had been repealed?
i

13

A

That has just been repealed by the Uniform

j

14

RE location Act which is set forth at length in our supplementa],

15

brief and is discussed in that brief* Mr. Justice Brennan.

16

Also in effect in 1968 was IM 8168* XM standing

17

for Instructional Memorandum* which is set forth in the

18

appendix of our briefP which was a regulation of the Depart”

19

meat of Transportation which elaborated on the requirements

20

of the statute, particularly with regard to fact-gathering and

21

formulating a relocation plan.

22

this statute and these regulations were in effect* there were

23

approximately 300 persons in the path of the Triangle.

And at the time of suit when

24

Now* the position of the Federal Respondents at

25

that time and now is that the 1968 Relocation Amendments and

4

1

the regulation 8168 did not apply because they say that these

2

do not apply to areas where right-of-way acquisition was

3

approved prior to 1968 and right-of-way acquisition in this

4

case had bean approved prior to 1968«
And that is their position, even though other

5

6

approvals, that is approvals for clearance and construction

7

had not yet been given»
Now, the facts of exactly how- many people were

8
9

there are not entirely precise, because discovery was denied

10

before trial in the court below.

11

from th© Triangle as of the time of the adoption, of the 1968

12

statute.

13

the time of the suit,

14

But perhaps no one had moved

And only a few had moved — and we know this — by

Slow, there have been several other changes inthe

IS

law which I would like to refer to only briefly and they are

16

set forth at length in our brief and that in 1970 before a

17

decision in the Court of Appeals there was something called

18

a circular memorandum adopted on April 10th, which in Judge

19

Sobeloff's view, and as he elaborates in his decision,

20

essentially repealed the interpretation of the statute and

21

22
23
24
25

.

the interpretation of 1M 68 which limited it to authorisations
fc© require right-of-ways which were approved after the passage
of the statute.

And, as I say, that's elaborated in the brief

and perhaps I will com© to it — in the argument.
And nonethe;&s, people kept moving out and in
5

1

May 1970 when the case was in the Court of Appeals the number

2

in the Triangle was down to 262«,

3

was under rehearing the number was down to ISO®

4

1970 it was down to 65.

5

to 35 and now it9s down to approximately a half dozen.

In July 1970 when the case
In December

In January of this year it was down

had now,, as of January 2, 1971 there has been

6
7

enacted the Uniform Relocation Act? which is set forth in our

8

supplemental brief and which also repeals the 1968 Relocation

9

provisions®

The Uniform Relocation Act caused the relocation

10

from all sorts of displacements* a variety of displacements

11

not really displacements * not merely 'displacements for

12

highways.

1.3
14

Q

Well, anyway that expressly saves® all

rights under the ©Id statute®

15

A

That is right and that is where —

IQ

Q

So the new statute has no relevance here?

17

A

No relevancy as to the persons who are not

18

IS

yet moved, I mean as of the time of its adoption®

29

Q

21

A

22
23
24

25

Well ~

Oh, I see.

You mean the half dozen®

Well, it would have relevancy; they would

be protected by the 868 statute —*
Q

No, but I suppose there are some difference

between the Uniform Act and the "68 Act are there?
A

Well, I think, as a matter of fact, as we
S

3

would argue it there are not very many material differences»

2

Certainly, if you view the °68 Act along with the IM 8168 the

3

regulation of the Uniform RElocation Act -Q

4

Well, what I'm getting at, Mr» Greenbergs

S

w@ don't have to foe concerned in deciding ‘this case with the

6

provisions of the Uniform Act, do we?
A

7

No; I would say you would not, because I

8

would say this case is determined by the '68 Act and I would

9

like; to argue to the Court why I believe that's the case»
Now, insurances were applied by the 1968 statute,

10
11

and that is the opinion of the Department of Transportation

12

under the United States and

13

by IM 8168, because 'their cutoff date which rested on their

14

interpretation that' the statute was invalid, then Petitioner's

IS

rights were violated.

The violation of those rights would

16

give ris© to a resiedy.

The question then would be; what is

17

that remedy?

18

.

Any claim was required

Now, at this time obviously the remedy in the

19

statute and in the regulations do not make much sense. Assur­

20

ances that tills Court, now that almost everybody has been

21

moved out and a plan now that everybody has moved out, would

22

not be the appropriate thing to do.

23

that a Court of Equity couldn't devise what would be the

24

appropriate thing to do.

25

if the rights were violated then the Respondents would have an

But that doesn't mean

We have suggested in our brief that

7

1

obligation to go and find the people who had beendislocated?

2

find out whether they had been located in housing which met

3

the standards required by statute and if not, relocate them.

4

And the State Respondents in their brief, seem

5

to concede that this would be an appropriate form of relief

Q

if we can find that there was a substantive legal wrong done

7

at the time.

^

And therefore, the question iss were the rights

8
9

•

violated by the 1963 statute?

Since perhaps everyone was at

10

the sit®, ©n the site at the time the statute was passed, that

11

it would b© decisive ©f this case if it were applicable.

12

w© submit that there is no doubt of its applicability and that

13

if we are correct the Department of Transportation and -the

14

courts below were not.

And

15

First I would like to point out that there was no

IS

question that no assurances were given as required by the 1968

17

statute.

18

their brief and it’s their position no assurances were given

19

because no assurances were required.

20

That8 s the Government3s position as set forth in

And secondly, the recent decision in this Court

21

of the Overton Park case comes into play because the assurances

22

that should have been given if, indeed, they should have bean

23
24
25

given and we would like to argue that they should have been,
would have constituted the administrative record upon which
the court below, the trial court and the Court of Appeals

8

1

should have mad© its appraisalp not in a da novo hearing of

2

calling in witnesses who had been involved in the transactions

3

but a hearing on the administrative record.

4

also I gather the Government6s positiont because in their

5

brief, 1 believe on page 42 or 46 they say that those assur­

6

ances — page 46 ~ would have constituted the administrative

7

record but there were no such assurances because they were not

8

required»
Q

9

And.then it^is

The findings with respect to discrimination

10

right at the outset here, Mr. Greenberg, discrimination in the

11

sale ©r rental ©f the property? isn51 that an arguing point

12

from which you have got to build a case?
A

13

Well, I would say no, Mr. Chief Justice,

14

because the trial court should have had an administrative

15

record before and it should have appraised that administrative

IS

record.

17

because the assurances which wduld have constituted that

18

record were not given because it is the position of the

19

Government, under its interpretation of the statute that they

20

were not required.

21

It did not have an administrative Record before it

We submit that that interpretation of the statute
V

22
23
24
25

is incorrect and we would like to demonstrate to the Court
why, quite clearly that interpretation is incorrect.
Q

Well, am I to understand then that you do

not make the claim that this record shows a pattern of
9

i

1

discrimination in housing?
A

2

Yes? we do make such a claim and we could

3

sustain that if it war© necessary to do that upon a de novo

4

record, and indeed, there is considerable argument in our brie

5

as to how the facts —

6
7

8

D

Q

The findings are t© the contrary? are they

A

The findings of the trial judge are to th©

not?

contrary, but those findings, we think, are first of all

to

clearly Qrronsbus if this were an ordinary kind of ferial, but

11

clearly irrelevant and improper because they were not made

12

upon administrative records such as this Court has indicated

13

would b© required in the Overton Park case»

14

1 would like to demonstrate that the 1968

15

Amendments were applicable and we find this in just about all

16

the sources one can find of statutory interpretations.

17

language of the statuta, the legislative history of the

18

statute and the purpose of the 1968 Relocation Amendments.

19

20

23
24
25

The

Now, we must remember it9s the Government's
argument that the statute is not applicable because it does
not apply to rights^of-x^ay which were authorized prior to the
adoption of the statute and the first thing we must not© is
this is manufactured out of nothing.
in vain to find such a limitation.

One reads the statute
Such a limitation appear

nowhere and it is not even suggested anywhere in the statute.

10

If one looks at the language of the statute now,

1

2

Section 501 is the declaration of policy, it sayss “Congress

3

hereby"

4

"Congress hereby declares'that the prompt and equitable reloca»

5

felon and reestablishment of persons, business and so forth

G

is necessary."

7

any cutoff date as to when the rights were authorized because

8

as the briefs of all parties indicates the time between the

9

author!nation of right-of-way and construction and relocation

10

it3s on page 4 of the appendix of our brief —

Xfe speaks about relocation.

There is nowhere

sometimes is a period of very many years.
!
If we look at Sections 511 and 1(d)(3) of the

11
12

statute, which defines a displaced person — we find a dis­

13

placed person defined as; "Any person who moved from real.

14

property on or after the effective date of this chapter, as a

15

result of the acquisition or reasonable expectation of acquisi­

16

tion of such real property.w
So, again that not only makes no reference to

\1
18

projects who, where rights of way were approved or acquired

1©

after the enactment of the statute.

20

being removed after the enactment of the statute.

It refers to persons

Now, the statute also has relocation payment

21

23

It requires not only relocation assistance,<■
• ’ ’'
but relocation payments. The time factors in the statute, to

24

the extent that there are any, refer to relocation payment

25

and new location assistance, without any discrimination or

22

provisions.

11

i

1

differentiation between the two and it has been the position

2

of the Respondents in this case that relocation payments may

3
4
5
6

be made to the Petitioners here and, indeed, more money to
the Petitioners here, yet there was no reason and nothinganyone could find in the statute to differentiate between
them»
Now, let's go back to the genesis of this

7
8
9
10
11
12

13
14
13
16

17
18
19
20

statute.

This statute came out of a 1967 study which was

ordered by a 1966 statute passed by Congress, and on pages 2
and 3 of our brief the Relocation Assistance Study Statute
appears —- 2 and 3 of the appendix in the brief —- and that
calls for a full and complete study and investigation for the
purpose of determining what action can and should be taken to
provide additional assistance for the relocation and reestafolishment of persons and so forth to be placed by construction
of projects on the Federal Aid Highway System.
Again, it looks.forward to dealing with people
who are going to be relocated and then if you look back to the
1962 statute which the 1968 statute replaced, we find, and
this is Section 133which is on page 2 of the appendix to
our brief, a limitation such as is not found in the 1968
statute and Section (e) says:

"This section shall apply only

with respect to projects approved by Section 106 of this Title
after date of enactment of the section.
found in the 1968 statute.

25
12

No such provision is

And the new statute, the 1968 statute, carne out

1

2

of a crisis caused by the need to relocate large numbers of

3

persons who were being displaced because highways were being

4

built through their homes.
Now, the National Highway System, which gave rise

5

6
7

8
9

io

to this problem was to be 41,000 miles away o

1968 statutes were adopted, 32,000 miles had been built; 9,000
miles remained to be built-

13
14
15

authorized»
Now, that would mean Congress went to all the
trouble and passed this enormous apparatus and this statute
and made all these requirements with regard to only 500 miles
and it just doesn’t make any sense.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It would mean that

Congress engaged in a futile act.
We would think that the government has fairly

Of the 9,000 miles that remained

to be built 8500 miles had already had their rights-of-way

At the time the

well described the reason for the position which was taken
on page 424 of the record.

They are willing to pay relocation

payments because after all, the payment of money is a fairly
simple and uncomplicated, unmessy act.

Mr. Carpenter, the

Division Right-of-Way Officer testified from page 424 about
whatit would mean to have to actually provide the relocation.
And he says:

"Certainly it would have bean putting another

hair shirt on the state to ask them to give us a formal sub­
mission on the record of what they are already doing.

13

They

1

would have had to stop work, put several people on this to

2

formalise it, submit it to me; have my people review it and

3

give them approval back*

purpose."
But on the contrary, Congress ordered that that's

It would have served no practical

just what had to be done.

Congress didn't want anybody to

wear a hair shirt, but Congress wanted that the

State and

the Federal authorities concerned should actually attempt the
difficult and perhaps unpleasant, but necessary job of relocation.
Now, the courts below accepted the cutoff date,
that is the cutoff date as to right-of-way acquisition which
had been approved prior to the enactment of the 1968 statute
and they accepted thatas an authoritative administrative
interpretation of the statute.

Well, everyone knows that

administrative agencies make interpretations of statutes and
those interpretations are entitled to considerable and often
conclusive weight.
But that is only so when those interpretations
come out of the practicalities of the situation, some special
experience, some involvement with the operation of the statute
and the program, which would lend a special authority to that
kind of interpretation.
So far as the interpretation of the plain language
of the statute

and its legislative history and its purpose,

25

14

1

courts and lawyers do that as well as administrators.

2

submit that the language and the legislative history and the

3

purpose of the statute call to the fact that Congress has

And we

intended to protect people who were going to be relocated and
not just a miniscule small amount of people who are going to
be in the way of the national highway system.
Now, if the .1968 statute is applicable and we
submit that it is,

there is no need to go into the 1970

regulations, though we argued that in our brief and Judge
Sobeloff sets forth the reason why they protect the rights of
at least those who were on the site as of the time of the
adoption of the regulations under the doctrine of the FortC?)
case or the J71 statute which would protect the rights of those
who, that handful who remained on the site after the adoption
of the '71 statute.

Or the constitutional question that in­

deed the constitutional question provides an additional reason
why the interpretation of the statute which we have argued is,
we believe, correct, and that is the statutory interpretation
which we urge would avoid the decision of the constitutional
question and it is the ________ ________statutory construction
that that is something which courts strive to do.
And so, for the reasons given we submit that
the Petitioners who were in the way of the highway in 1968
are entitled to protection of the 1968 statute; are entitled
to the protections of the instructional memorandum.

25
15

The case

1

is not moot? it involves these petitioners as well as many

2

others situated throughout the country and the only issue in

3

the case is V7hat form of relief shall be granted and that a

4

court of equity can figure that out.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At the outset let me say that Respondents do not
contend that the 1368 Amendments to the Federal Aid Highway Act
are wholly inapplicable to highway projects already under way
on the date of enactment.

The relocation payment provisions

are clearly applicable to such projects.
The provision requiring the state to provide a
relocation program is clearly applicable to such projects.

And

the statutory requirement that all housing meet the decent,
safe and sanitary housing standard as defined by the Secretary,
is clearly applicable to such projects.
What, in our view, and in the opinion of the court
below is not applicable to projects which by August 23, 1368
had advanced as far as the two here in question, is the single
statutory provision of Section 502 requiring that states submit

25

16

1

to the Secretary certain formal assurances before they can

2

obtain his approval to proceed with that phase of the project

3

"which will cause the displacement of any person" family or

4

business.
And, insofar as. the statute is here involved, it

5
6

is the applicability of that prevision and that provision

7

alone that is at issue in this case»

like to allude just briefly to Petitioners' telephone survey
which they discuss in their briefs and which is Plaintiff's
Exhibit 25.

They contend that this survey showed that out of

50 private dwellings telephoned only eight would rent to
Black families.
That survey did not show that 42 of the dwelling
units would not rent to Black families.

Twenty-eight of the

homes within that survey were not even asked the question
because they didn't have any vacancy when they were called.
In fact, only four owners gave any indication that they would
not rent to Negroes.

One of those owners said that she would

Thank you, Mr. Preiser.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Tha;fact is: the statute was not complied with.
The assurances that are required by statute were not given; the
plan as required according to the interpretation of the statute
was not filed, and the fact that

there wasn’t even a claim

filed, it appears that this litigation is very much like the
litigation affidavits in Overton Park.

And that isn't what happened here.

The Court

made a de novo review of the basis of ad hoc, post hac ration­

statute was designed to provide.

Q

And we submit -—

Supposing you prevail in this case.

Exactly what do you visualize the relief will be?
A

The relief as to the 326 persons who

18

originally resided on the site of the Triangle, would be some­

19

thing in the general nature of what the State respondents agree

20

would be appropriate.

And they agree that if they lose the

21

case this would be appropriate, and that is that the State

22

authorities would have to find where these people have been

23
24
25

relocated to and in fact, they said they were somewhat in the
process of doing that now; and find out whether or not the
housing which they now live in meets the statutory standards.
36

If it does not meet the statutory standards then

i

2

they would have to take such steps as are necessary to relocate

3

these people in statutory housing»

4

provided for in the statute, but that was an adaptation of it

3

which is appropriate in the circumstances of this case»

Now, that5s not the relief

And, of course, there would be a rule of law

coming out of this case which would protect legally any other

8

persons who ware in the way of a highway.

That’s right; that's right. They are that

326.

Now, there is some difference between us on the
provision of the 8500 and 500 out of the 9,000 miles.

We have

cited in our brief on page 29, the Senate Committee Report and
I believe, or at least I hope we will find in that report that
37

\

approximately 8500 miles had already been authorised and

therefore if their interpretation of the statute prevails,

3

only persons in the remaining 500 miles would be covered.
