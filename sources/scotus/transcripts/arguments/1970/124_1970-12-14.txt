PROCEEDINGS

MR„ CHIEF JUSCICE BURGER:

Mr„ Greenbergs you may proceed,

3

MR, JACK GREENBERG, ESQ: Mrc Chief Justice and may it
4

pleasethe Court,, This case is here on Petition for Writ ©£
5
Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
6

Fourth Circuit which affirmed in part and reversed in part
7

the decision of the United Stated Dictrict Court for the mid­
8

dle district of North Carolina by a decision in which Judge
9

Sobeloff dissented,
10

The issue is one ©f statutory construction

of Title 7

11
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964» And the particular statutory

12

pro isions to which I would like to draw the Courts attention
13

appears on page 2 of our brief. The statute makes it an un­

14

lawful employment practice for an empolyer to fail ©r refuse
15

16

to hire or discharge any indivudual or otherwise to discriminat
against him with regard to race.

17
18

And then in section 2 which more particularly applies to

19

the issue-we have pending here„ to limits segregate,, or classify

20

his employees in any why which would depiiv/e or tend to deprive

21

any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversly

22

affect his status as an employee-, because of race and other

23

forbidden reasons.

24
25

The question presented in this case is whether intelligence
tests and a high school graduation requirement may b3 used as

3

1

a prerequisite to promotion from the job of laborer to the

a

job of coal handler* and perhaps other jobs at Respondents

3

power planto

4

When these tests* that is the intelligence tests* which

5

I might say was adopted on July 2* 1965* the effective date of

6

Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964* and these tests

7

screen out Negroes at a signif icantly higher rate than they

8

screen out whites* and there has been no demonstration that

9

the tests and the high school requirement predict ability to

10

do the job* and indeed there are some evidence to the contrary

n

that they do not predict ability to do the job.

12

Now the Court below held in tie- case of employees employed

13

after the high school requirement was instituted that the

14

statute was not violated and as l read the opinion ©f the^ourt

15

below and the position of Respondents* they rest on three sep­

16

arate grounds.

17

First of all* that there was .no demonstration of an intent

18

to discriminate. Secondly this is a statutory argument and that

19

is that such tests are priveledged as professionally developed

20

ability tests under section 703H of Title 7. And th«.n there

21

is an assertion by the Respondent which we say has no support

22

in the record* in fact the record is in some parts contrary

23

that the tests are a legitimate business need. That is* that

24

certain employees are not fully promotable throughout the plant*

25

to higher positions* and that the high school education require4

1

ment helps select employees who are»
Now before elaborating on ©or argument, we would like t©

2
3

make our position clear with regard to ability testing» No

4

employer, we submit under t&e statute, is required to employ

5

enyone who is unable

6

tests and educational requirements which predict whether an

7

employee, a perspective employee, can do the job»
But if the test that5s used, ©r the education requirement

0
9

do the job,, And any employer may use

that5s used means that members of a race, or of a group pro­

10

tected by the statute, and does not predict who can do the job,

It

in other words does not pave predictive validity as indus­

12

trial psychologists use the term, and this record uses the

13

term, then it cannot be justified merely on the basis of good

14

faitho
Good faith or intent, we submit, is an elusive concept

15
16

which regularly, frequently is advanced in Civil Rights cases,,

17

We hear good faith defenses in school segregation cases, in

IS

jury discrimination cases, in voting discrimination cases, and

19

the courts have regularly responded that they look to results

20

and not make an effort ®> read the mind ©f an employer, indeed

21

it's something much more difficult to do to read the mind of

22

a corporation as to what it intends to do by the application of

23

certain standards of testings

24
25

Indeed, whili it is not impossible on this record to chal­
lenge the good faith of the Respondent, because that's just
3
5»

1

something that one can very rarely develop evidence oaf such

2

a tsst would be an invitation to many who would seek to evade

3

the statute to hide behind the concept of good faith»

4

Now, as I said* Duke P@~wer Company adopted the test re­

5

quirement for initial employment on July 2*

6

of the act in question» Until then,, and until after the filing

7

of the charge in this case, in fact» employment at Duke Power

8

Company was rigidly racially segregated. Black persons

9

worked in the Labor Department only. White persons worked in

965* the date

10

the better and higher paying jobs* that is the Departments

11

described in the record, as Operations* Maintenances Test and

12

Laboratory and Coal Handling. And the highest paid black

3

worker made less money than the lowest paid white worker*

4

under this system.

5
IS

Q

Now, 3 uondestand, in the Labor Department, that

that was all Negro» was it?

7

A

Yes, well, it one time—

8

Q

All Negro?

9

A

-—-there was a white foreman in the Labor Departments

20

Q

Well, what my real question is as a matter of fact,

21

and

22

partment all Megro and eveyy other department in the company

23

all white, prior to

24
25

don't know that I fully understand, was the Labor De­

965?

A

Yes.

Q

Or was a.t only that the Labor Department was all

4
6

1

Negro* and that th© other departments* Coal Handling* did

2

have some Negroes in &t?

3

A

¥<hur first formulation is the correct one, there ®as

4

rigid racial segregation,, The Labor was all blae^* everything

5

else was all white0

6

Q

Up until 1985?

7

A

Well* indeed* until up until after the filing of th©

e

charge in this case„ Some time after that*

9

Q

(inaudible)

10

A

Well* I think the first black msM probably got out

11

of the ^abor Department in 1988* after the charge of the un­

12

equal employment opportunities*

13

Q

14

ments?

15

A

16

Q

17

A

18

And there were no Negroes in the other four depart­

That is correct*
Up unitl—
And there8s <n© question about that* on the record*

2 don*t think the Respondents laouXd challenge that for a moment*

19

Q

No9 l just was inquiring as a matter of facte is all*

20

A

But the intelligence test was put in at the request

21

of certain*

22

Handling Department as a substitute for a high school education*

23

and it hss been described in the record as a test which would

24

identify th© average high school graduate B so it*s perhaps

aon-high school graduate workers in the Coal

25

somewhat more stringent than the high school graduation re—
5
7

1

qoirement ia that half the high school graduates presumably

2

would b© unable to pass this test,

3

And to enable them to be promoted t© the so called inside

„

4

departments

5

departments are inside. The high school education requirement

6

was adopted considerably earlier» and the date is not certain,

7

but it appears to be, people talk in terms ©f about9 about

8

1955 as a prerequisite t© employment and promotion in all

9

departments but the Labor Department, Black people could be

10

employed in the Labor Department without a high school ed­

11

ucation, others could be employed in the other departments

12

initially only with a high school education. But many pre-1955

13

Duke Rawer employees are non-high schood graduates at all pay

14

levels throughout the planto And indeed the, our brief has an

15

analysis of the pay which is earned by various workers, the

16

pay earned by an average high school.' worker, an average non-

17

high school worker, is about the same, the calculations are ©n

18

page 38 of our brief,

19

Labor and C@ai Handling are ©utisde» all the other

And the governments

brief engages in a similiar analysis

20

of promotihility, comparable promotibility and promotion rates

21

of high school and non-high school graduates, and it finds that

22

high school and non high school graduates within the plant are

23

roughly promoted at approximately the same rate,

24

Q

Does this record show the total employment figure

25
in 1955, and the total employment figure correctly?

3

I

A

I couldn’t spell it out* To quote the Respondents

2

is this case» and I®m sure this is right*, th§sy quote a real*,

3

stable employment situation there and there have been about

4

95 workers at all times that are relevant to this ease»

5

Q

I wondered at that figure» because it certainly

6

would b© counter to the general growth of everything in the

7

last 15 years.

0
9

A

Well» S’© not familiar with the industry. It just

may be that the power industry - it's possible to expand
/

10

power production perhaps from other locations without increasing

11

the w@r& fore©» but the employment situation has remained just

12

about the same.

13
14

I think there doesn’t seem to be any real doubt about that
and they characterize it as stable» and it apparently is*

15

16
17

After the passage of the Act and the filing of the com­
plaint before the Equal Emp.ic*yraent Opportunity Commission»
jBuEe did promote a number ©f black workers wlhh a high school

18

education over a period of a couple ©f years*

19

q

20

but not the actual promotion of others employed before the

2?

high school education requirement was adopted,, This is sow

22

in further litigation by the District Court because there’s a

23

claim which Court has not yet rendered any decision and some

24

whit© people have been brought in above these b&ack workers.

25

And the Court of Appeals then ordered the promptibility

The Court has not resolved that*

This case involves four workers frozen in the Labor
Department by the test requirement of July 2S 1965s and by
the fact that they have no high school education»
Q

Have they taken and failed these tests?

A

The recortf is not clear ©a -yiio has taken and who

has not.taken this test» The record indicates that three

which two are black and which one is white9 have taken and

9

failed the test* Everyone who has taken the tsst has failed

11

an entirely overwhelming number declined to take the test» They

12

d©a®t want to take the t9St? this lss however,, class action

13

and our argument about the test it that it is patently dis­

14

criminatory as I hopd to develop in a moment or two that that

15

really doesn’t matter, it doesn’t have any—-

15

the Court of Appeals defines a class as those who may subse­

16

quently be employed and may hereafter seek employment* That’s

17

the very first sentence of Judge Boremans —
As 1 was saying, 6he case involves those workers who

m
19

want to be promoted from Labor to Coal Handling,, Now white

20

men without a high school education who have not passed the

21

testsj,and who do not have a high school education are doing

22

the coal handling jobs today» Typically, the way the workers

23

qualify for the coal handling job is by on the job training,

24

the company testifies "We would have to determine that by ac10

25
A
11

The—
13

1

Q

Does this show any—-

2

A

There is some statement by Respondents that elsewhere

3

in the utility industry tests are being used, but I would

4

like to day that, first of all, there is no demonstration

5

that to perform the job of e©al handler, you have to have a

6

high school education, in..fact if you look at the laborers

7

job - the laborers job and the coal handlers job specifications

8

appear on pages 48 and 65 of the record;, and the;?® re roughly

9

the same, The coal handler has to , just to read a few of them,

10

has to operate certain vehicle service including coal handling

11

equipment and be able to record weights„

12

On page 65, the laborer has to operate company vehicles,

13

has t© be able to operate floor sweeping machines, tractors,

14

trucks, and so forth.

15

Things are comparable. People are trying for the jobs

16

by on the job training, there is no indication that a high

17

school education in any way qualifies one to do the job.

18

Indeed if one were to look at the Wonderlie test that

19

appears here on page 102 of

20

h®w for the qualifications put down for a coal handler that

21

there®s any need to know or to have a sense of the difference

22

between the words ADOPT and ADEPT, REFLECT and REFLEX, PREj

23

TENTIONS and PRETENSIOUS, IMAGE and IMAGINARY, and LARGE and

24

AGGRANDIZE and various other ibinds of——

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

I*d like to reserve the balance of

MR0 FERGUSON: Mr» Chief Justice* and may it please the
Court*

11

We are here today to determine the rights* dusty*, and ob­

12

ligations of employers and employees inprivate employment*

13

In the mid-1950s* as has been indicated to you* Duke Power

14

Company adopted a practice of requiring a high school education

15

for pormotion or hifing into all departments other than the

16

Labor Department* at extreme stations. The heart of this case

17

is whether or not that practice is discriminatory under 'title 7

18

of the Civil Rights Act ©f 1964,

19

As to four Negress who were hired aftee the adoption of

20

that requiremento Sine© adoption of the requirements no em­

21

ployee* white or black* has been hired into departments other

22

than the Labor Department unless he had a high school education*

23

A collateral issue in this case* in our view* is whether or not

24

the tests used by the company as a substitute for the high school.

25
requirement violates that*
15

17

1

Petitioners assert that the educational requirement is

If there were no high school graduation requirements

In addition I would say to you that Mr» A„C0 Theis9

18

Vice President ©f Power Production and in charge of the steam

20

the high school requirement because its business was becoming

21

more comples» It had employees who were unable to grasp situatiofasn

22

t© read*, to write., and who didn't have an intelligence level,

23

really to progress upward in the higher skill lines ©f pro­

24

gression that we’re talking about.

that they could do the job

Hows then you say were talking about9 are you talking

about promotion within the department or are you talking about

Interdepartmental transfers?

A

5
6

Interdepartmental transfers,, At that point„ Your Honor»

I was saying this0 That we found that we were gettinggsome read\

7

blocks because we had hired people without a high school ed­

0

ucation and without mechanieal and general intelligence 1« :®1

9

that ultimately„in view of our business becoming more complex»

10

we were hiring poeple and we were suffering roa*f blocks and

11

these tests» and the Petitioners own evidence» were designed

12

t© include not to exclude anybody without a high school educa­

13

tion.,
They had three non-discriminatory alternatives by which

14
15

they could travel into the other» the higher skilled lines of

16

progression,, One» they could take the test» and make satisfactor f

17

scores and progress. Two» they could take advantage of the com­

18

pands tuition refund program which we pay 75% of the cost of

19

a high school diploma ©r a GED equivalent, @r they could do

20

it on their own. They had those three alternatives,

21

Q

Existing employees,

22

A

Yes» sir» this is for incumbents» oblyB about which

23

we're talking. The Court below cured discrimination as to the

24

six black employees who were contemporaneously hired with the

25

whites who were hired into the better departments and Mi© had

20
22

1

been progressing along and ordered that when the District Coart

2

fashinsd a decree that it woild take those sis employees,

waive the educational and test requirement as to them, and

moted after the Civil Eights Act became effective on July 2S

10

1965e they were all promoted out of Labor into the higher

11

skill lines of progression and which we would contend is the

12

precise effect Congress intended» Because both Courts below

13

found and concluded that Kt-groes were relegated to the Labor

14

15

Q

Let me see if I can translate what you9ve said not in

16

tos?ms of the actual situation on this record, but the operation

17

of it» If a man of any racial or national origin is hired in

18

the Labor Department now without a high school education or any

19

other test, and at some point thinks he can qualigy for one

20

of the other operating departments in the company, is he per­

21

mitted to, does he come within this group in which his tuition

22

is paid three-foutths by the company?

23

A

24

Q

25

Yesfsir.
And if he passes the test he can join in this up­

ward movement?

21

23

A

1

Yes, sir. If he comes in without a high school-- I

2

see your p&int, Mr. CMe£ Justice—-“.if he comes, in at the Labor

3

Department without a high school education, your question is

4

does he have to pass the test and have a high school education

3

requirement also, is that it?

6

Q

To get out of it - move on up?

7

A

Yes, sir, he could take the test and move on up0 We’re

3

speaking about new hires in t© departments other than Labor<,

9

They must have a high school education

10

and in addition thereto'

pass these two tests, that's what we're talking about»
Q

II

Now since these tests have been inaugurated, since

12

this policy is in effect, how many people have moved out of

13

the labor force by this route, into other branches?

14

A

Through the testing route?

15

Q

Yes.

A

As indicated earlier three, two blacks and one white

an unfair test» insofar as Negroes are concerned.

A

All rightj, sir» any I speak to that just a moment?

19

Q

Well, that is the - do 1 understand the claim in

20

the opposition correctly?

21

They claim the test as to Negroes are unfai,r beeuuse

they*re culturally deprived and therefore placed at a compe­

titive disadvangage.

And what they*re asking is that you tailor a new

test that will be directed at the particular job ahead.
23
25

A

Yes, sir and I would respectfully submit to you that

the legislative history of the Act clearly shows that gen­
eral intelligence, and aptitude tests, that Congress intended
tlat they should be usedo And I point specifically to Sen­
ator Towers language, this is all discussed in pages 27 - 40 of
the brief, I would direct the attention of the Court to this,
when Senator Tower called up his original amendment he stated,
"It is an effort to protect the system, whereby employers give
general ability and intelligence tests to determine the train*'
ability ©f employees/'
Q

What page were y©u on, precisely?

A

That is page 31 of our brief. Your Honor*, If you'll

go ©n Oyer to page 32 you’ll see Senator Lausehe°s question,
demanding to is now where there is language in this bill that
allows the Motorola-type test be given0 I would point out even
more particularly to you, on page 38, the Clark case interpredated memorandum, prepares by the justice Department which
states this,"There is no requirement in Title 7 that employers
abandon bona fide qualification tests where, because of dieferences in background and education, members ©f some groups
are able to perform better on these tests than members of
other gr©pps0 An employer may set Ms qualifications as high
as he likeSo He may test to determin is which applicants have tbes

11

Yes9 sir»
——but it doesn't say that they can be wholly ir­

relevant to the job that he's being employed to fill»

12

A

Well9 now, 2 would'answer that this way» The Bennet

13

and the Wonderlic are*, of course^ professionally developed tests»

14

That alonep we realize, is not enough» The courts below found

15

that we had a genuine business purpose in adopting the high

16

school education requirement and they found that the tests were

17

a reasonably satisfactory substitute for tie high school ed~

18

«cation requirement»

19

KoWp if we assume that the tests are professionally dey-

20

eloped ability tests8 and that Congress intended to allow the

21

use ©f general aptitude and ability tests, then,, and in that

22

event, the crucial inquiry becomes this» Are the tests de­

23

signed p usedp or intended to discriminate?

24
25

!foWp as to design, the two tests ia question here were
designed by professional psychologists» The record evidence

25

27

1

shows that the Wonderlic was designed to measure general in­

2

telligence p and that the Bennet mechanical AA was designed as

3

a measure of mechanical comprehension,, The use of the two tests

4

is as a substitute for the high school edacatioa requirement*

5

Purely and simply to determine of the employe© has a general

6

intelligence or overall mechanical comprehension level of the

7

average high school graduate*

0

What about the intent? Weil® once the employer establishes

9

a legitimate business purpose for an employment practicef test­

to

ing or otherwiset then that practice is nan-discriminatory

11

even if it operates to prefer whites over blacks*

12
13
14

The &nt©nt and t^e legitimate business purpose are in­
extricably bound up togeth-r® I would submit to the Court*
Q

That's very w&ll used as kind of a slippery and am­

It could be reads couldn't it#

16

and that's, I gather9 how your brother® ©n the other side rmd

17

it * that is if their us;© results in discrimination,, then th©y3*e

18

used to discriminatej, and on the other hand it could be read as

19

if they did it® they're rsot subjectively used for purposes of

20

discrimination then they're all right* I simply suggest that

21

that's not the clearest word in the world® in this context*

22

Well, sir® I would submit to you that it's factually

impossible to use it to discriminate in this case as 1 point

I appear before you today on behalf of the Chamber of

This case is one which is of vital concern to employers*

Both small and large throughout the United States* In todays

just as there are many employees ^© desire to be promoted into

25

The employer must make a choice „ and the choice confrenting

him is often a difficult one» We believe employers Must be

Mr* Cohere let me put this question to you» Assume

6

an area of the country* where„ I suppose in &he Southwest „

7

there are people whose family language is SpanishP and have

8

a rather limited comprehension of English» Suppose an employer

9

provided for farm workers that they must pass a test. something

10

like a literacy test in English* on the face of it that would

11

be a rational request generally for employers* XBm sure» It's

13

might or might not have any relationship at all to the job»

14

WouldnBt that bring it under the Acfs If the impact was

there?

16

A

I think that this is really the heart of this case»

U

Most educational tests today» unfortunately* or aptitude tests*

18

have a discriminatory impact on one or more racial groups»

19

This is the (inaudible) problem of the socio-economic

20

status of these groups has historically evolved» The position

21

that Petitioners urge says that whereever you have an educations
requirement» wherever you have an intelligence test» the employer

22

is then obligated to prooce business necessity» That he had to

ihen he ought to b© permitted to use it,

When Congress9 in the act of Title 7, it knew that ed­

3

ucational requirements and tests had a potential discrimination

6

of the type you Just, referred to,. St didn't outlaw the use

of festSo It didn't prohibit the us© of educational requirements

11

I---

12

Q

13

Well» does it go that fars that it must be sufotrefug®»

or is it on the impact?

14

A

It's whether on the basis ©f the evidence in the case»

15

did the employer use or intend that the test be discriminatory?

1©

That's the words» of» for example» 703H„
All through here» really» is that if a business necessity

They approached it on a case by case basis and on the

that the test is one of business necessity and that in turn

are required by employees in the Coal Handling.

Q

Well* they might go up t© foe President* too.

I

That8s corr©ets but the question is, should you In

a

each ease require the employer, before he uses a test, to first

3

demonstrate that that test is related Juist to that particular

4

job, or can you have a test that relates to more than one job?
Q

5

1 still think that you can hire somebody as a Coal

6

Handler and put the requirement that he have a PhD0 You have

1

that righto Any employer does® But does h© have that right under

8

this Act? That * s the question,
A

9

Mr feeling, Mr, Justice Marshall, is that this is like

10

a case of an employer who discharges a union employee during

11

a union organisational campaign,

12

H© has no right to discharge, if he’s discharging the

13

employe© because he’s engaged in union activities. But he

14

does have the right if he’s acting for a legitimate purpose,

15

business purpose,, and not because he’s trying t© get at the

16

employee because he’s a union person.
If someone sets up a standard for the Coal Handling de­

17
18

partment and does that with no business purpose and only s©

19

that he can prevent Negroes from entering that department,

20

theh 1 think he’s violated this law,

21

Q

But h© did it, knowing fully well that he had a prior-

22

policy of rigid segregation and exclusion, He’s not writing on

The company put in the policy of permitting» as an

3

alternate to the education requirement, eff permitting tests*

4

That was put in the day(inaudible)* The educational requirement

5

antedated that by some ten years* How do you let the employer

given the act became effective (inaudible) an additional avenue

7

for promotion that was ©v-er and above what he had done prior

t© the as to

9

Q

Be for© that all you needed to show was a high school

10

diploma* And after that if you dida*t have a high school di­

11

ploma yon had to give a test which he gave* Duke gave the test *

12

marked the test, right?

13

A

Yes*

I think the point that S*d like t@ make :1s that

14

I think what the Court of Appeals needed to consider was all

15

factors8 the timing of- the test» what the employers race re­

16

lations» hhat his general action was in the area of race re­

17

lations» what kind of expert opinion he relied

18

later on» in fact he®s engaged in validation studies now* And.

19

oa8

what he did

And on the basis of that entire e©cords the Court of

20

Appeals had to- make a decision off whether there was a legitimate

21

business purpose* The summary in the Court of Appeals I said

22

were to have considered whether the employer eeally had a le­

23

gitimate purpose in discharging the union employee* I think

24

the Court ©f Appeals considered all these facts» it rated the

25
timing» as yoisr'v* indicated along with all the other facts in

35

37

1

the record, and it reached what is a reasonable decision,, And

2

it8s the decision that I think that this Court ought not to

3

disturbo

4

My principal reason for appearing here as an amicus is

5

not so much to argue the facts as to whether the Courts d@sisio.ji

6

was correct9 but whether the Court of Appeals applied the correct

7

testo
That, 1 think, is the key issue in this ease,- How we

8

would urge that the Court of Appeals did apply the correct

9
10

testo That it reached the correct results applying that test

11

is a different story. But w© think the correct test should

12

b© one, as the Court ©f Appeals did, of whether the employer,

13

in all the circumstances ©£ the case, and ©a a case by case

approach adopted a - had a legitimate business purpose for

Without rqgard to job relations,

YesB I think job relationship is one aspect, and not

the only aspect of the case,

18
19

Q

That should be considered, do you agree?

Oh8 absolutely,. But it should not be determinative,

you’d regard that as sot very job related?

My feeling is that you could caver prsove that

there was a business necessity for that teste And cor that

it was job related ic the sense that the employees had to have

that shill in order to perform that job»

6

As 2 understand the Petitioners position9 if it had cot

7

been validated9 which includes job relatednesss under the EEOCs

a

guidelines8 the employer could not us© it.

9

Q

Their command of English would be relevant only t©

to

the extent that it was necessary to understand instructions„

11

isn’t that about it?

12

A

You would have to demonstrate that the employees

13

could cot d© the job if they did not understand English,, And

14

that an understanding of English was essential to the job0 If

15

The employer could not proove those two points0 he would have

Fine.

6

A.

High school education would really tell you that you

7

have the necessary abilities defined by a high school education.and if the company feels that this is required in these jobs ,

9

then that's all it would tell you.

10

That's what Respondents and the amicus are saying. That

11

the company feels that you ought to have these qualifications,

12

and the company ought to have the right to do it. but thtt's

13

not -what the statute says. The statute changes the pre-existing

14

situation.
It says it's an unlawful employment practice for am employer

15
16

to, and I'll just summarize here, classify employees in any way

17

which would tend to deprive any individual of employment oppor­

18

tunities or which would in any way adversely affect his status.

19

And the statute says you may not classify. They have classi­

20

fied them by ability to take the test, and have a high school

21

education.
And it deprives, and ccrtaibly tends to deprive them, and

22
23

adversley affects them with resprct to employment and promotion

24

and psy. And we submit that that's a violation of the statute.
how there is an exception in this statute which we refer

25
39

41

to, section 70311, which is the professionally developed ab­

1

2

ility test provision, and that comes out of the Motorola case

3

which was refered to.
The Motorola case was a case quite unlike this case. The

Motorola case and this case

was a case in which the hearing examiner held that even though

Now that's not this case, and that's not this statute.

If these Petitioners were tailing a job validated, job related

In addition to which I mean just to--

Q.

Judge Soheliff, I gather, would agree with what you

z

just said, and he said, however, that there's been no showing

3

in this case that any—--that these tests are related to any of

4

these other jobs.

S

A.

That's right. It 's not-- you can divide the job

6

validation into two parts. Job validation with respect to im­

7

mediate employment and future employment, over some peroid of

8

time. And that second category is not quite so simple because

9

I think a company might have to demonstrate that there is a

10

regular flow cf people through the plant and that they can't

11

function with people stopping off somewhere on the way up the

12

ladder, but nevertheless if they could show that, ahd they

13

could show that it would interfere with their function impro­

14

perly to have people stopping the line of progression and

15

not become foremen and supervisors, and so forth, then they

16

would have established a kind of job validation.

V_

But they haven't done that yet. Theyve just made an asser­

17
18

tion about it. And that's not adequate to divest the

19

Petitioners of their rights, we submit.
Q.

20

You dont’ think general allegations that a lot of jobs

21

on the ladder that require some kind of abstract skills or some­

22

thing like that is not enough-A

23

I would say that would not be enough when you're deal­

24

ing in an area like this where, without speaking about any

25

particular case, there's a lot of duplicity going on, in a lot
42
44

1

cases, you have to have something you can deal with objecti­

2

vely. But apart from that, we have non-high school graduates

3

across the total range of employment in this plant, so that

4

really doesn't hold water.

5

Just a final ward about 703H. We submit that the Equal

6

Employment opportunity Commission, which is charged by the stat­

7

ute with he enforcement of the statute, is in a partucularly,

8

peculiarly advantageous position to construe it. And it has

9

construed the term"professionally developed ability tests" to

10

mean a job validated test.

11

So far as the legislative history is concerned the briefs

12

are full of, we think, that the conclusion of the Equal Oppor­

13

tunity Employment Commission should be despositive, we think tha :

14

we have demonstrated quite clearly in the brief, the legislative

IS

history indicates

16

indicates his ability to do a job, not to pass a test o# the ab

17

stract which doesn't indicate anything at all. Mr. Chief Jus­

18

tice, you adked a question abbut the ability to speak Spanish,

19

there was a case quite like that, it was settled. It was against

20

one of the Southwestern power companies, which involved height.

that one ought to be able to pass a test which

4

In order to be a line man, you had to be above a certain

21

22

height, and for a variety of reasons, Mexican-Americans in that

23

part of the country were not above a certain height, generally

24

speaking, and they could not get the jobs. Yet there was no

25

•indication that height had anything at all to do with the abilit’,
43

45

?

to do the job. Proeedings were brought and the case was settled

2

and the case never came to a decision. But we would submit that

3

if one could show that this was a height test, and that only one

4

third as many black people qualified for the height test as whit

5

people, and that height had nothing whatsoever to do stiith .the

6

ability to do the job, we'd have exactly this case here, and tha

7

the result should be the same.
0.

9

Let me ask you this, Mr.

reenberg. Suppose in terras

of eligibility to intern in a hospital, the hospital standard

10

required that they be persons whose scholastic training and

11

general aptitude measured by some reasobable test, were such tha

12

they were qualified to become staff members. In standing alone

13

would you regard that as a reasonable--

14

A.

Mr. Chief Justice-- -

15

g.

--- criteria?

16

A.

This is not a subject about which I know anything at

17

all but it would seem to me that a medical education is or at

18

least ought to be directly related to the ability to practice

19

medicine, and that the excellence of ones training and what one

20

has learned as demonstrated by his record would bear some relati

21

tion. I would assume that that would be job validated.
0-

22

The implications of my questions are that some medical

23

graduates would and some would not be able to take that ultimate

24

test of being ultimately qualified to be staff members.
A.

25

Well, I would assume that relevant criteria would be

44
46

5

used, and that that would be job validated» It would make sense

2

to me. I can't imagine why it wouldn't but it’s not anything I

3

really know anything about.

5

Qt

case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 1:20 o'clock p.m. argument in the above
