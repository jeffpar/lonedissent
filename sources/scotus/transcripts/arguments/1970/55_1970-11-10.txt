ARGUMENT OF PETER I». STRAUSS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

©

MR. STRAUSS:

7
8

We will hear arguments in

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In this case a three-*judge District Court, sitting in

9
10

the Central District of California, has held Section 4006 of the

?!

Postal Code as unconstitutional on its face.

12

case, which immediately follows, another such court, sitting in

13

the Northern District of Georgia, also held Section 4006 uncon­

14

stitutional on its face, together with Section 4007 of the Code.

IS

And because of the similarity of the issues the Government filed

16

a single jurisdictional statement brief and appendix, and I

17

believe it will be helpful now to make a statement in sufficient

18

detail to eliminate the issue in both cases.

In The Book Bin

I may say parenthetically that while I will continue

19
20

to refer to the statutes as Sections 4005 and 4006, under the

2?

Postal Reform Act passed in the middle of this summer they are

22

now actually sections where they will shortly be Section 3005

23

and 3006.

24
23

But they are otherwise unchanged.
The decisions in both Courts were limited to proce­

dural questions arising under the statutes.

One of the papers

2
i

1

for appellees contended that the publications in question are

2

not obscene.

3

reached that point, and that, in fact, neither of the three-

4

judge Courts which decided these cases ever had the magazines

S

in issue before them.

6

My understanding is that the proceedings never

The decisions assumed that traffic in obscenity could

1

be barred from the mail and considered only whether these two

8

sections are constitutionally appropriate procedures for accom­

9

plishing that purpose.

10

Section 4006 provides that when the Postmaster General

11

finds a person who is using the mails to sell or advertise

12

obscene matter, he may administer an administrative order inter­

13

cepting mail addressed to that person and directing that it

14

be returned to the sender marked it is unlawful.

15

The section and its remedy are almost precisely the

16

same as that provided in Section 4005 of the Code, again now

17

renumbered Section 3005, dealing with the use of the mails to

18

promote fraudulent enterprises, the section which this Court has

19

twice sustained, most recently in an opinion by Mr. Justice Black

20

in Donaldson v. Reed Magazine, 333 D.S. 178.

21

Administrative proceedings under Section 4006, again,

22

are governed by the same regulations as those used in fraud

23

proceedings under Section 4005,

24

relief of a preliminary nature for both Sections 4005 and 4006.

25

The regulations concerned do govern the adminstrative proceedings

Section 4007 governs judicial

3

1

that are set out in extenso in our appendix to our jurisdictional,

2

statement.
Under these regulations the statute has much narrower

3
4

scope than it might at first appear from its language.

The

5

proceeding starts when the Postmaster General discovers that

6

possibly obscene matter is being sold or advertised through the

7

mail.

8

to him for clearance of any kind or for any other purpose.

There is, that is, no obligation to submit any material

After complaint and notice, a trial-type administrative>

11

is held.

12

of initiating by complaint, but also establishing the obscenities

13

in the materials or the fraudulent nature of the materials is

14

challenged.

15
16
17

In that hearing the Government not only has the burden

During the period in which the hearings are taking
place, unless there has been judicial relief under Section 4007,
the mailer receives to receive his mail completely unimpeded.

18

The hearing officer is a regular departmental hearing examiner„

19

His time typically is principally devoted to contractual issues

20

and other departmental matters.

21

an opinion on as carefully preserved a record as any Federal

22

district judge would be.

23
24
25

He is required to write as full

The regulations urge speed in conducting the hearings
and disposing of the complaint, but, again, it is only when a
final administrative determination has been made that the items

4

1

sold or advertised are indeed obscene# that any steps can be

2

taken by the Post Office on the basis of the administrative

3

proceeding to interdict the defendant's mail.

4

Like these procedures, the order entered by the Post­

5

master in the Section 4006 case is identical in form and in exe­

6

cution to that which is entered in fraud cases# which is under

7

Section 4005.

8

and return to the sender appropriately stamped all mail con­

9

nected with the items which have been found to be obscene ox-

It directs the Postmaster to remove from the mail

10

fraudulent, as the case may be.

11

to refuse to honor postal money orders drawn in payment for these

12

items or in response to the fraudulent enterprise.

13

It also directs the Postmaster

It may be clear from the form of address used or from

14

information on the envelop that some mail is unconnected with

15

the adjudicated item.

16

rest, generally speaking, the Postmaster cannot inspect on his

17

own, since the Constitution and statutes protect first-class

18

mail from such inspection.

19

That mail is immediately delivered.

The

It is, therefore, held at the post office for inspec­

20

tion by the addressee and anything not concerned with the adjudi­

21

cated items will be delivered to him when he inspects it.

22

mail which is connected with the adjudicated items or which is

23

not inspected within a reasonable time is stamped and returned

24

to the sender marked as the statutes direct.

25

Only

Once this Section 4006 order has become final in an
5

1

administrative proceeding, the order goes into effect auto­

2

matically without any need for judicial enforcement.

3

may be sought, however, in District Court, and in order to

4

describe the effect that we believe that review has on the admin­

5

istrative order, it would be helpful now to turn to Section 4Q07

6

which is principally at issue here in the second of these two

7

cases.

8
9

Review

Section 4007 provides fox' preliminary judicial relief
during the pendency of administrative proceedings under both

10

the obscenity and fraud provisions.

11

used, in fraud cases and it might be instructive to give an exam­

12

ple of that.

13

It has been prominently

An advertisement was recently placed in a California

14

newspaper offering a very low-cost Hawaiian vacation, since the

15

person responding would only send in a $25 registration fee.

16

The Post Office, suspecting fraud and able to convince the judge

17

that there was probable cause to believe that the advertisement

18

was fraudulent, obtained a Section 4007 order and under that

19

order was able to intercept $250,000 in remittances that had

20

been sent to the advertiser, who indeed did prove, as I under­

21

stand, to be conducting a fraudulent campaign.

22

Similarly, in a 4006 case that is an obscenity case,

23

use of the Section 4007 order might be proper or helpful in

24

preventing widespread dissemination of the materials concerned

25

before an administrative proceedings could be complete.

6

1

Procedures under Section 4007 are those which govern

2

injunctive relief generally in Federal courts and, in particular

3

those specified by Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce™

4

dure.

5

Q

Mr. Strauss, let me try to get the procedure in

6

this interception case that you speak of, the tourist travel

1

fraud.

The mail is impounded in that interim period, I take it?

8

A

That is right.

9

Q

And that is the situation until a final decision,

10
11

is that correct?
A

Correct.

And of course the same situation here,

12

the mail may continue — when I speak of the mail, the person

13

to whom it is directed may continue to advertise and may con­

14

tinue to solicit remittances, and if he ultimately prevails,

15

why, he will receive all of those orders and remittances.

16
17

18

Q

But the remittances are impounded and the mailings

are impounded as well?
A

Any letter to him would be dealt with in the same

m

way as under the statute, except that it wouldn't be returned.

20

That is, mail that is clearly not connected with the enterprise

21

would be delivered, and mail which might be would be held for

22

inspection and could be removed if it could be found to have

23

been connected.

24

25

The relationship of the statute to Rule 65, I think,
is significant, because of that section's limitations on the
7

1

possibility of ax parte relief, that the Government knows the

2

mail is addressed to the purpose of getting relief under Section

3

4007, it also knows it is addressed for the purpose of serving

4

notice of the proceedings.

5

can never be ex parte.

And for this reason such proceedings

In order to justify interim relief, the Government

6

7

raust produce the material thought to be obscene and must satisfy

8

the judge that there is probable cause to believe that it is

9

obscene.

The interim relief granted, as I just explained, is

10

the impounding of the incoming mail, with delivery of mail which

11

seems not to be concerned with the enterprise in question, and

12

possible delivery of other mail if upon inspection it is found

13

jnot to have to do with it.

14

interim relief in this nature, there is always available through

15

judicial processes the possibility of modification of the order

16

when either delay or other circumstances would tend to warrant

17

that relief.

18

In addition, as in the case of all

Because Section 4007, if I may return now to Section

19

4006, provides only for impounding the mail during the review

20

of an administrative order, and Section 4007 specifically states

21

that it is preliminary relief both during the administrative

22

proceedings and during any appeal therefrom.

23

24
25

The co-section,

4007, provides only for impounding of the mail during a review
of the order.
We have interpreted Section 4006 as subject to the
8

That is, if review of the Section 4006 order

same limitation.

2

is sought, the Post Office can only impound incoming mail until

3

its order has been judicially approved»

4

face is subject to the contrary interpretation and, indeed, if

5

no review were sought, the Post Office believes that the Section

6

4806 order is immediately effective.

7

necessary consequences of Section 4007 is at least that where

8

review of the Section 4006 order is sought, that has the effect

9

of transmuting the relief to the simple impoundment.

The statute on its

But we think that the

Only when

10

judicial approval has been obtained where review is sought will

11

the Post Office begin to return mail to the sender stamped as

12

the statutes direct.

13

And, indeed, as we point out in our brief, one of the

14

possibilities open in this case — we don't urge it, but we

15

don!t believe it will wrench the statute if it were necessary —

18

would be to give an even more strict interpretation to Section

17

4006 and hold that where review is sought, no effect could be

18

given to a Section 4006 order so that interim relief would depend

19

entirely on the availability and the obtaining of judicial under

20

Section 4007.

21

Turning very briefly to the facts of this particular

22

case, appellee publishes, advertises and sells through the mails

23

a variety of magazines of the character described in our brief.

24

In the fall of 1968 the Postmaster General became aware of seven

25

of these in particular and directed Section 4006 proceedings be

1

brought,

2

was set for December 3, 1968% on the same day as the hearing,

3

December 3rd, the Post Office secured a temporary restraining

4

order under Section 4007, specifically limited to the seven maga­

5

zines charged on the basis of probable cause finding, believing

6

them to be obscene.

7

A complaint was filed and an administrative hearing

On December 31st the judicial officer filed the lengthy

8

opinion set out in our brief and in our jurisdictional state­

9

ment, finding that each of the magazines was obscene.

Appellee

10

then brought this injunctive action to bar enforcement of the

11

resulting administrative order.

12

A three-judge court was convened and held that Section

13

4006 was unconstitutional on its face.

14

of decision was that the statutes failed to meet the standards

15

set by this Court in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51.

16
17

18

The sole stated ground

On the Government's appeal the Court noted probable
jurisdiction on March 2 of this year.
Now I think there are three principal points on -which

19

i have to address myself.

20

one of the Courts below, but suggested, I think, almost inevi­

21

tably by intervening decision which, as this Court knows, we have

22

appealed here, and that is the question ostensibly settled in

23

Roth v„ United States, whether indeed the Congress can regulate

24

the use of' mail for the sending of obscene matter.

25

One of them is not decided by either

The second question is whether the particular procedure s/

administrative procedures in this case -- as I mentioned, this

2

case, The Mail Box case, deals only with Section 4006, and while

3

they refer to Section 4007, any discussion of it, 1 think, would

4

be appropriately referred to the Book Bin case;

5

administrative procedures for determining obscenity are appro­

6

priate under this Court's decision in Freedman v. Maryland, and

7

that was the sold ground of decision below.

8
9

Whether the

The third point, \tfhich was the ground of decision in
The Book Bin case, is the issue of whether the orders which

10

may be obtained as relief are a proper form of relief in light

11

of this Court's decisions and, in particular, the decision in

12

Lamont v. Postmaster General.

13

On the question of authority to close the mails to

14

this kind of matter, the general authority of Congress over the

15

mails is firmly established in, as I mentioned before, precisely

similar circumstances, except that the occasion was fraud and

the other was obscenity.

19

case, which we discussed at some length in our brief, but it

20

might be helpful, I think, to simply read one short passage from

21

22

to us is equally applicable here.

7

the obscenity statutes, which were upheld about six years later

8

not this particular statuta, but other statutes -- dealing with

9

the Government’s authority over the mail in the Roth case.

10

Q

When was that particular statute first granted?

11

A

This statute was enacted in 1950, two years after

12

17
18

10

20
21

22

the decision in Donaldson, and on the model
Q

I take it that if you feel that if an affirmand

comes along here, then Section 4005 and the integrity of the
Donaldson holding are both placed in jeopardy?
A

Well, obviously, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it would

depend somewhat on the character of the affirmand.

I think

there is a particular risk in that direction under 4007, which
treats both statutes, and the objections to which seem to me
run equally to the fraud statute as to here.

The Court may be

able to discern some differences between fraud and obscenity.
The Government does not.
.

23
24
25

Other than that, the answer to your question is cer­
tainly "yes.''
The interest of the Government in regulation of the
12

1

mail has sometimes bean questioned*

2

position which now has a substantial adherence in the courts that

3

the Federal Government has somewhat less interest in the regula­

4

tion of these matters than perhaps the states have, but I think

5

it fair to observe that position has always been articulated in

6

terms of a level of obscenity rather than the question whether

7

the relation is or is not possible.
The materials in question must be hard-core or not,

8
3

I realize that there is a

which might be insis ted upon by the Federal

Government and not

10

by the states, and not whether a particular form of regulation

11

would or would not be possible.

12

me to point out that the consequences for the Government and

13

for the Government's posture here are not at all abstract.

And I think it incumbent upon

As the Court knows, use of the postal services, which

14
15

is a Government enterprise, is a very valuable tool for distribu

16

tors through the mail and I think any time that the Government

17

becomes involved in this enterprise by lending this aid, there

18

must be some appearance to the people of the country that this

19

legitimises in some sense the enterprise which is taking place.

20

And if, indeed, it is an illegal and illegitimate enterprise,

21

one which the Government has a right to interfere with, why then

22

the Government cannot tolerate and indeed will not tolerate that

23

situation.

24

mailers have a claim not simply to pay their own way, but to

25

It is not irrelevant, in these circumstances that these

have the Government pay part of the way for them through the use
13

You say the Government pays that.

Of course.

1

In referring to that, 1 would simply try to

2

lay some groundwork on the proposition established by Roth which

3

is thought to be called in question by Stanley, that indeed

4

there is some interest in regulating in this area, that the

5

Sovernment has some very substantial intere;st in dealing with

6

this field.

7

Q

8

Well, your argument earlier was that the Govern-

nenfc is much broader on obscenity and pornographic materials.

9

A

That is also true.

10

Q

Well, what is the whole range besides fraud?

n

Is

there stock fraud?

A

Any sort of fraud that is dealt with through the

13

nail.

14

thought to deal with obscenity, since that is the way the pur­

15

veyors originally conducted their business having to do with

16

the use of false names and addresses.

17

There is also a section which was initially the section

I might point out again that it is the special char­

18

acter of the mail, and that even if one gave Stanley the broad-

10

ast reading, it ifould be difficult to say that it necessarily

20

forclosed the type of relief which this type of statute embodied

21

Ln that one cannot know, as one can where material is sold all

22

Dver the counter, one cannot know whether the sale involved is

23

indeed to an adult or to a consentual, the two parameters of the

24

Stanley opinion on which a considerable weight has been placed.

25

But going beyond that, I think it is sufficient to
15

1

observe at this point that the Stanley opinion carefully pre­

2

serves the right of state and Federal governments to proceed

3

against commercial enterprises in this field, and it is not

4

hard to discern in that opinion, which cites the First Amendment

5

nonetheless a considerable degree of emphasis on the Fourth Amend­

6

ment and on considered notions of privacy which are especially

1

appropriate there.

8
9

Indeed, as we suggested, it seems more appropriate to
deal with Stanley as a case in imposing a disability on the

10

Government because of the particular dangers of the situation

11

with which the Georgia statute in that case attempted to deal,

12

than in a case which recognises a kind of right to receive on

13

the part of the individual involved and which therefore might be

14

used as a tool, as indeeid the purveyors of this material are

15

seeking to use it for a stand in the area for which they operate

18

free of Government interference or supervision.
Turning to the Freedman question, it seems to us, as

17
18

we set out in our brief, that this case is entirely different

19

from the situation which confronted this Court in Freedman v.

20

Maryland.

21

with movies and the law before the Court required that anyone who

22

wished to show a movie in Maryland, before he could show it, must

23

submit it to a board of censors, and that board would then decide:

24

whether or not he would be permitted to show it in the state.

25

If I may recount that briefly, that case was concerned

them, and to that extent it can be said that the statutory scharru:

consider mandatory, they will have preserved their mail to the

ARGUMENT OF STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. FLEISHMAN;

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Strauss.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

8

If the Court please, this case started when a postal

9

inspector, representing himself as being over 21 years of age,

10

ordered seven magazines which he said he wanted.

J1

Post Office started the administrative proceedings that were

12

discussed by Mr. Strauss and had the order, the effect of which

13

was to keep every adult person who may similarly have wanted to

14

order these magazines from getting them.
It

had the effect of invading the privacy of the

16

mail because persons who sent first-class mail to appellee had

17

their mail poked over by post office persons in the office to

18

13

to appellee.

20

obtain these magazines for his own entertainment, for his own

21

amusement or for his own information, would have this fact known

22

to the postal authorities, whether he wanted them to know/ about

23

xt or not.

So that a person who may privately have wanted to

I

.

24
25

We have here, in short, the kind of Federal censorship j
which this Court has repeatedly stated was not tolerable under
20

1

2

the First Amendment.

Very interesting to me is the fact that counsel have

3

not mentioned at all the most recent case decided by this

4

Court, Rowan, which seems to me to be dispositive of the issue.

5

Because, after all, in Rowan this Court said that the house­

6

holder, the free American citizen, was to decide what came into

7

his home or what did not come into his home, so that in Rowan

3

the focus was on the right of the free citizen to say, “I do not

9

want this."

10

This case deals with the question of the right of the

11

free citizen to say, "I do, yes, v/ant this," and the right of

12

the Government to say, "In spite of that, you cannot have it."

13

The question is not, as the Government has put it,

14

whether the First Amendment confers complete freedom on control

15

by Congress to use the mails for commercial purposes.

16

course, do recognize the binding effect of Rowan, which puts a

17

limitation on the use of the mails and not yet in effect, Con­

18

gress has already implemented -- perhaps without knowing it --

19

important portions of the Lockhart Commission Report on Obscenity

And it is as to that that I want to address myself.

11

The Government takes interesting positions.

12

the Government said, perhaps a most private kind of communica­

14

given full bloom, it is when you have distribution by first-

13

class mail to consenting adults..

Perhaps if .ever Stanley can be appropriately

In its brief the Government does say, "If Stanley

17

does protect such activity, then it might appear that use of

13

the mails, inherent private, and the case of a mailed order blank

19

ordinarily consentual is, indeed, protected fjrcrn Government

20

regulation."

21

On that reasoning only the uninvited advertisement or

22

mailing obscene matter to a minor could be made an offense and

23

Roth would not only have been limited, but the Government says

24

And as I

read the statement by Mr. Justice Stewart, and he is here to
correct me, he said he \*as not anxious to hurry on to new con­
stitutional frontiers.
Now I read Stanley as going on to new constitutional
frontiers and rightly so, becai^se Roth was a debacle in its
application.
Q

After 13 years of using Roth, —As I read Stanley, Stanley said that every man's

home was his castle.

Your Honor, 1

2

Q

It's a damned nuisance.

3

A

Your, Honor, you wrote the opinion and all I can

4

do is read the opinion.

But in Stanley you went back to Winters.

5

The key to Roth, the whole key to Roth, was that obscenity was

6

without redeeming social value, and because it was utterly with­

7

out redeeming social value, then it was outside of the protection

8

of the First Amendment.
Now Your Honor twice in Stanley said that a person

3
10

has a right to obtain a free material, so-called explicit material,

11

whether or not it had any redeeming social value.

12

cited Winters.

Twice you

Winters says that material is protected whether or

13
14

not it has any social value.

That is the underpinning of Roth.

15

Nov/ it may be that because Roth had as its premises two things,

16

both of which are now gone.
The first was to rely on Beauharnais.

17

In Roth Justice

18

Brennan said that Beauharnais had recognised that there was a

19

kind of speech in obscenity which was outside of the protection

20

of the First Amendment.

21

cantly changed, as we see it, by the New York Times case and

22

24
25

Since then Beauharnais has been signifi­

cases which have followed it.
The other underpinning for Roth was this social value

23

test.

j

And Stanley rejected the social value test.

I don't know

what else was in your mind, Mr. Justice Marshall, but that was

24

the underpinning and that was

No, 1 hesitate to quarrel with the author of an

6

Q

Well, maybe we might have to make that clearer.

7

A

Well, perhaps, Your Honor, I would hope that it

.

5

There was an opinion v?hich said that Roth stood

opinion.

8

would be clearer to bring about the kind of rationality that we

3

need in this area, because if we are going to follow the confusion

JO

that has been brought about by saying that obscenity is outside

1?

of the protection of the First Amendment, I very much fear, Mr.

12

Justice Marshall, that v/e will have really the kind of witch

13

hunt that we have not had for a very long period of time in this

14

country.
So I would hope that when this is clarified, the clari­

15
16
17
13
19

fication would be in the direction of sanity, which is basically
that consenting adults should have the right to choose their

would because this Court has dealt with the problem for 13 years,

2

It was a difficult problem and I don’t think that anybody sitting

3

on the Bench who has considered the problem at all could be

4

satisfied with what has happened in the area of obscenity and the

5

First Amendment.

I

No one knows to this day what obscenity.

6

Mr. Justice

7

Harlan had occasion to comment on this in the 3am Ginzburg case.

8

Anyone looking at the opinions in the 13 years would find them­

9

selves in total and complete bewilderment; and the reason is

10

that it seems to me after 13 years that the rule isn't working,

n

then there is something wrong with the rule.
Now what was wrong with the rule, I submit, is that

tz
13

the notion that such speech was not speech and therefore it was

14

outside of the protection of the First Amendment, was a false

15
16
17

premise.

Obscenity, after all, is nothing but. sex speech, which

a lot of people don’t like.

That is all it is.

It is like saying that religious speech that we don’t

18

like is somehow outside the protection of the First Amendment.

19

Now there is a great deal of additional knowledge that we have

20

obtained since Roth came, down, which ties into the correctness,

21

Mr. Justice Marshall, of your statement that a social value is

22

not a correct test.

23
24
25

.

.

And it is very interesting in the Lockhart Commission
Report, where they spent something like $2 million and two years,
the Commission came to the conclusions that this material we have
26

I

all been calling obscene, in fact does have social value.

2

is to say, that the people who have been buying the material

3

and reading it had benefitted by it.

4

sex in a way that was helpful to them.

5

entertainments satisfied, they have had their curiosity satis­

6

fied, so that the whole assumption, of Roth that explicitly

7

sexual material was totally without any value, 1 submit, is

8

factually untrue, Mr. Justice Brennan, and that is what the Lock­

9

hart Commission has concluded.

10

That

And, as I sav, Rowan is one recognition of this aspect.

21

The other recognition is in the recently passed laws which have

22

not yet gone into effect.

23

Q

Did the Lockhart Commission undertake to address

24

itself to keeping materials of this kind out of the hands of

25

minors and the unsolicited?
27

!

1

A

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it does, and as a matter

2

of fact the two Federal statutes, which have been passed, are

modeled -— although they are parallel, I don’t think theyCongress;

4

modeled it upon the Lockhard Report.

But they come out about

Q

The Lockhart Report Says they think there were two

alternatives, and that the Commission believes that the path

that Congress took in terms of making it a criminal offense,

9

in addition to what Rowan did, let's say, to keep it out —

10

but I will say criminal offense to mail to unconsenting adults

11

or to minors, and the Lockhart Commission has stated that that

12

was the preference to them so far as Federal is concerned.

13

Q

Is the mailer protected by simply having the

14

recipient who sends in an order fill in a blank that I am over

15

21 years of age?

16

A

That is part of it, but the new legislation, Your

17

Honor, goes further than that, because the new legislation per­

18

mits the Post Office Department to prepare a list of persons who

19

either do not want any material that is expressly sexual or do

20

not want it for their minors.

21

can get themselves on the list, and then that material is sent

22

to that house under penalty of being a criminal offense, because

then the mailer is told not to send it there.

And instinct with that v/hole opinion was the other side
of the coin of being told that if he didn't want anything, he
could keep it out; and if he did it, lie had every right to have
it come into his hone.
In' the Rowan brief -- and I understand really why the
29

Government did not cite Rowan, because in Rowan the Government

2

made an awful lot of concessions that are totally inconsistent

3

with the position that the Government is talcing here.

in its brief on Rowan, on page 6, at footnote 1 the Government

5

said that adults who want to receive obscene material can

receive it under this bill.

Again in their brief in Rowan, this is what the Govern­

was no right to receive.

In Rowan they say in making the assess­

ment, that is with regard to Section 4009, Congress was of course
aware that the freedoms of speech and press embrace the rights

24

necessary to effectuate those freedoms, including the right to

25

circulate and receive publications, the right to listen and the
30

right to read, citing Stanley, .-lartin and Lamont.

And then they went on to say,

"As this Court suggested

there is no other way to handle the problem other than by per­

17

mitting consenting adults to satisfy their curiosity and inter­

18

est in matters pertaining to sex.

19

Q

That in a free society

I suppose that was the satisfaction that the

20

Lockhart Commission was dealing with questions of policy, not

21

with constitutional law.

22

A

I haven't read their report, but --

That's right.

That is only partially true, Mr.

23

Justice Stewart, because underlying the questions of law certain

24

assumed facts -- for example, once vze learn that there is social

25

value in what we have always been calling "obscenity," then we
34

1

have a whole different legal question, the assumption upon which

2

the law proceeded„ which we now know is false if we accept the

3

conclusion of the Lockhart Commission.

4

Q

But did the Commission itself purport to determine

5

reaching constitutional decisions, decisions of constitutional

6

law?

7

A

No, of course not.

8

Q

It was just recommending policy?

0

A

It was recommending policy based on facts instead

10

of prejudice and fear, which I think makes a basic difference.

11

It should also be observed, it seems to me, that most of the

12

free world appears to be traveling in the same direction.

13

not only Denmark has abolished its obscenity laws, Sweden -- the

14

last I heard — was about to do so.

15

In VJest Germany the highest court has concluded, insofar as con­

18

senting adults are concerned, that they should have the oppor­

17

tunity to receive and there should be the opportunity of selling,
(
too, to consenting adults.

18

IS
20
21

22

And

I think they have by now.

There have been studies in both Israel and Great Britain
which were comparable to the Lockhart Report, reaching basically
the same conclusions, and indeed the whole area of saying that
people should be able to read what they want in this area, touches

23

upon in other areas of law that have a relevance, and that is

24

that consenting adults ought to be able to do what they want to

25

do — at least in the area of sex.
35

You know about the modern penal code, tentative draft

\

2

No. 4, which came out in 1954, which basically said that what

3

adults do privately is no legitimate concern of Government.

4

ever approach we take in that regard sure by 1970 we have to

5

agree, it would seem to me, that we should be allowed to think

6

about and dream about all of these sexual that are running through

7

our heads anyhow.
There is one very interesting study in the Lockhart

8

9

Wha

Report that perhaps bears repeating here.

A group of persons

10

were shown the most pornographic pictures that the researchers

11

could get and then they were measured for the impact on the

12

individuals, both in terms of heart beat, blood pressure, dilation

13

of eyes and things like that.
Then the same people were told to just imagine, to

14
15

draw their own pictures in their own heads, and the effect was

16

twice as much.

17
18
19

own much better than any of the mailers could create it.

The

short of the matter is that you are going to dream anyhow, so we
may as well accept it in terms of having a little -Q

20
21

In short, the individual was able to create his

Do you think you have to paint with such a broad

brush to prevail in this case?

22

A

Ho, and I will --

23

Q

You haven't really addressed yourself at all yet

24

to this point, which in the lower court at least, was dispose

25

of.
36

1

2

A

I will save the remaining five minutes for that

and 1 will now address myself to that»

3

First of all, the statute plainly does violate the

4

Freedman principle»

S

Office Department can execute its own order, so once the Post

6

Office Department decides that the material is obscene, then the

7

mail is interfered with»

8

if we want to do something and even if we were to file a lawsuit,

9

there is no assurance that the mail will not be sent back»

Under this Federal censorship law the Post

The burden is upon us to file a lawsuit,

When we file the lawsuit, there are no time requirement s

10

11

within which the Court would have to decide whether or not we

12

are right and the burden of proof is placed upon us when we file

13

the lawsuito
The statute is also bad because it permits an adminis­

14

15

trative official, a Post; Office judicial officer, who really is

16

a censor in spite of

17

censorship.

18

censor.

19

far back as the Kingsley Book case Mr. Justice Brennan suggested

20

that obscenity could only properly be decided by a jury because

21

it was so linked with the question of the average persons.

22

what Government counsel said.

It is a

When this judicial officer acts, he is acting as a

He makes the determination rather than a jury, and as

But here we have dispensation of the jury in favor of

23

a postal censor.

There is no requirements of scienter at all,

24

and this Court has said although the obscenity is an especially

25

vague law, that the scienter requirement compensates in some
37

1

regard.

2

scienter is irrelevant to it, so that we — and we have also

3

what is basically a Lament point, because here what happens is

4

if we think in terms of the householder who mails a letter to

5

the appellee, then his mail is interfered with.

6

fact, what happens is a man will send in his money and he will

7

never get a response because the Post Office Department has

8

impounded really the mail.

Here we do not have the compensation of scienter because

Now

0

As a matter of

it is true that under the unlawful order it can

HO

be sent back, but the way the Government handles it, while

11

litigation is pending, it is neither sent nor is it delivered,

12

so it is held.

13

a half people have been sending in money to appellee and the

14

Government has that money, so we have the kind of heavy hand

IS

that is an intrusion upon the mails that has been repeatedly,

16

as I said, found upon by this Court.

Now you take this case.

For about a year and

17

Q

What is the Government doing with the money?

18

A

Well, the Government is just holding the money,

19

Mr. Justice Black.

20

to us.

21

they will either return it to the person who sent in their money

22

or give it to us.

23

They don’t return it and they don't give it

They say that when this case is finally decided, then

In the meantime though, something like a year and a

24

half has expired while we have been proceeding this way and again

25

I want to emphasise that we are talking about magazines which are
38

1

identical, to magazines found not to have been obscene by this

2

Court where the state proceeding was involved, not a Federal

3

proceeding.

4

concerned, it seems plain tq us that there is no question but

5

that the material is not hard-core pornography and,in fact, it

6

is constitutionally protected material under this Court's

7

stcindards, vague as they are, and as unsatisfactory as those

8

standards are.

And at least, so far as the Federal Government is

Do you know how much money has been impounded up

to date?
A

No -

Q

The alternative construction of the statute that

the Government suggests on pages 26 and 27 of the Government's
brief would serve to eliminate that, at least the Freedman

objections to this, in your submission, wouldn't it?
A

No, no, Mr. Justice Stewart.

It would go to some

of it, but not really cure it, because what the Government says
is that you can interpret the statute and say that, first of it,
if we file a lawsuit — first of all, the burden is still upon
us to file a lawsuit, while in Freedman the burden was upon the
censor to file the lawsuit to indicate a censorship»
So the first thing iss. it becomes our burden to go into
Federal court and bring an action, which distinguishes it in the
first instance.
Q

Secondly, --I thought the Government position was that they
39

would do it.

A

Ho, sir.

Q

Maybe issue a temporary restraining order against

Ho.

5

Q

Unless they did, there would be no impoundment.

6

A

That is not the Government's position at all.

7

What the Government did say is that there is another section of

8

the law, Section 4007, and that 4007 takes care of some of the

0

problems.

But if you are thinking in terms of Section 4006 alone e

10

it is not the Government’s contention that they have to go into

?!

Court to have that order enforced.

12

an FCC order, an NLRB order at all.

13

They do not treat this as

They still say that we would have to go into court.

14

They don't say with what period of time.

13

really happens to the mail at all, but their proposal is that

16

we could go into court, and then when we go to court, then the

mail would be impounded and it would not be sent back to the

person who sent it to us.

But that does not meet Freedman really

in any of the respects.
We have to court.

It is our burden to prove, to

satisfy the court that the administrative agency was wrong, and
there would still be no time requirements of the kind required
by Freedman.
Q

Mr. Fleishman, your time is up, but I just wanted

to question you, if I may.
40

1

A

2

Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Could Congress constitutionally prohibit the kinds

3

of mail that you send out for your advertising,, your scouting,

4

to people who did not request it in certain instances?

5

talking about consenting adults.

You are

Lay that aside.

You only get the indication of the consenting adults

S
7

Dy sending them some samples of your materials, in effect, as I

8

read this.

9

Q

10

A

What's that?

Q

Yes.

1?
12

13
14
?5

Or at least Congress constitutionally
There is another statute, Section

1009.

The householder gets mail and he is dis­

satisfied with it.
Q

Are you talking now about the Rowan situation?

A

Yes, that is Rowan.

But under Section 3010,

16

:hough, and Section 301]., which are new statutes which have just

17

jeen passed under the reorganisation law, there the Congress has

18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

said that there is a way of preventing the householder from
jetting even the first mailing, and that is when the householder
:an put himself on this list» saying "I do not want to receive
my material dealing with sex."
If he put himself on that list, it becomes a crime to
:o send it to him.
Q

lie doesn't get the first mailing.

But the householder takes the first step there,

ly question was, can Congress constitutionally prohibit you from

41

1

sending out any advertising material which discloses the kind of

2

material that you are going to sell?
A

3
4

not want it?

Without knowing that the person receiving it does
Is that the question?

3

Q

No, without knowing anything about it.

6

A

I don't think Congress can do that, because I

7

believe just as people who do not want it have a right to say,

8

"No, I don’t want it," the avenues of communication must be left

9

free for those, in fact, who do want it.

10
11
12

13

As a matter of fact,

the legislative history behind Section 4009 specifically stated
that that is what they vranted to keep open,

So those people

who wanted to receive such material, Congress said, they should
be permitted to.
The other side, of the coin is that every way that is

14

15

fair in terms of saying a person does not want it, then I think

16

Congress can have a lot of free way there and free expression

17
18
19

20

in preventing that where there is an unwilling audience.

I think that just blanketly to say that you cannot send out any
advertisements dealing with sex, I do not think that Congress
could constitutionally do that.
That is going too far.

21

22
23
24
25

But

Q

That would be governed by Lamont, I should thinx.

A

Yes, I believe that is exactly right.

Q

Mr. Fleishman, let me ask you what I asked Mr.

Strauss.
42

i
2

If you prevail here, is the integrity of the Donaldson
decision in any way affected, in your view?

3

A

Not necessarily.

4

Q

So that you can -- there is a distinction between

5

fraud, on the one hand, and obscenity, on the other, if I over­

6

simplify?
A

1

Those are very distinct ones.

I must comment on

8

it because we have a First Amendment, which protects the right

9

to distribute books and magazines at least to willing persons.

10

There is no comparable constitutional right to perpetrate a

11

fraud.

12

Additionally, whatever else we may say about the vague­

13

ness in the term of "obscenity," we know that a Post Office

14

hearing examiner, who is merely a censor, is the least qualified

15

person to draw that fine line which separates unconditionally

16

protected speech from criminal speech.

17

\

That is a different situation than you have with fraud,

18

so that it is perfectly possible, in my judgment, to say that

19

this docket is bad as it applies to obscenity, because we are

20

either in the First Amendment basically if I read Stanley cor­

21

rectly, or we are faced with different principles which apply

22

than would apply in a fraud area,

23

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
