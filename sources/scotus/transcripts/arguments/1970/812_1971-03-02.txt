Under the Colorado Water Right

and Administration Act

II

replaced with 7 water divisions, Water division 5 included

12

the area drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries

13

excluding the Gunnison River, and this includes the former

14

water district 37, in the Eagle River Watershed,

IB

of 1969, the 70 Hater districts were

In February of last year the Attorney General re­

16

lieved by mail a paper signed by the Water Clerk of Water Div­

17

ision 5, directed, to all persons interested in water applicap­

18

tions in that division and supplying a list of water right

10

applications filed in that office.

20

The paper concluded with the statement that the

21

recipient had until the last day of March, 1970, that was

22

the month thereafter that he recieved the notice, to file

23

with the Water Clerk a verified statement of opposition ,to

24

any such application.

25

Similar notices have been . .

recieved by the Afc-

As in the Eagle County

case affected by the proceed­

types, appropriative rights acquired under state law, and

it

12

Because of its size, Water Division 5 contains a

13

multitude of federal rights to demonstrate their magnitude and

nature we have prepared a map on which has been delineated the

15

thought to, then suggest any reason why the Colorado Courts

1

will not follow federal law, if that's part of the —— of

2

your position.

3

A

Yes» Your Honor, we are concerned about

4

the opinion of the Colorado Supreme Court to that extent. In

5

that respect. To the extent that the Colorado Supreme Court

6

discussed the question they said that the decisions of this

7

Court reviewing Winters v. United,States, in 1908 which an­

&

nounced the reserved right doctrine, Federal Power Commission

9

v. Oregon, 349 and Arizona v. California in 1963, 373, were

to'

not determinative of the question.

11

Q

Would that determination of the Colorado

12

Supreme Court be reviewable here at the instance of the United

13

States?

14

A

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is.

15

&

So you do get a review in a federal Court,

A

Yes, our position is that this is reviewable

16

17

here.

18

and the Supreme Court which held that the decision, in effect

19

the Supreme Court of eolorado said that when this matter was

0
21

22

presented to them that they would decide it on the basis of
Colorado law.
And they referred to the Stockman v. Leddy case

23

which Justice White referred to, in their opinion and said

24

that they would have to overrule that decision if they found

25

that there were reserved rights

6

of the United States in the

‘I

state of Colorado«,

z
3

Q

Well

you think Leddy purported to

say what federal law was?

If the United States didn't reserve any?»

They said that

byadmitting

Colorado into

the Union with a constitutional provision9 a state consti­
tutional provision that said that all water rights of the
state of Colorado were the property of the people and subject
to appropriation under state law , that the United States is
precluded from asserting a claim of reserved rights, within
Colorado.
Qur response to that, if Your Honor please, is that

20
21

Leddy relies upon the enabling of the

thing-—-

13
14

Colorado law there

the enabling statute, requires in Section 4 that the people
of the territory of

Colorado recognize and disclaim any

right to the public lands within that territory and recognize
that

that is a matter for the sole and exclusive dis-

p osition of the United States.

7

1

This was a specific provision of the Enabling Act,

2

and that act was, and that provision was referred to once again

3

whan the President proclaimed in his Presidential Proclamation

4

after the Colorado Constitution

S

was a state.

6

was adopted that Colorado

So that we say that by this provision of the enabling

7

act, Congress reserved to itself the right to the dispose of

8

public lands, except for the school lands which were granted to

9

the territory and

SO

ounts for

II

certain other lands in specified am­

public buildings.
And we say there, in furtherance of that,

12

that

13

public domain for a specified purpose, land it reserved as

14

well it reserved the appurtant water rights, to fulfill the

15

purposes of that reservation, and that carried with it the

16

priority of the date of the creation of the reservation subject,

17

and I wish to point out, subject to

18

time of its creation.

19

thereafter, when the United States

reserved from the

rights vested at the

The matter of the legislative history I would discuss,

'20

Mr Justice Harlan asked if there were some specific episode

21

which triggered off the enactment of that statute. And I

22

think Mr, Balcomb has referred to a specific episode which did.

23

It was a proceeding in the home state of Senator

24

McCarran, the sponsor of the act, in Nevada on the Quinn River,

25

And it involved a suit for administration of water rights, al8

1

ready having been adjudicated

2
3

under state courts,

And there the United States had purchased, had
applied by purchase certain

water rights on the Quinn
r*

4

River. And this is the primary concern of Senator McCarran.

5

This is demonstrated by his statements on the floor

6

of the Senate, the fact that he says itrs to allow the United

7

States its

8

for Indian purposes, to have a better right than the former

9

owner, is not fair and just as to the other water users on

10

own right,

or as a trustee, those were acquired,

the stream.
And of course the terms of the statute, I might

It

12

point out

13

appropriative right state, such as Nevada or Colorado, the

14

state here involved, the only way a private citizen can ac­

15

quire water right is by the application of the water to a

16

beneficial use.
And that water right becomes fixed in amount and

17
IS

refers to appropriation under state law, and in an

quantity by that act.
Another characteristic of an appropriative right is

19

20

that it is subject to

21

use. How considering the legal characteristics of an appropria­

22

te Ve right, the second things of the McCarran Act, which I

23

would refer the Courts attention to, is consistent Uiith the

24

first.

25

loss through abandonment or of non­

Only if the consent to sue is restricted
9

to rights

1

acquired under state law. The second sentence of the McCarran

2

Amendment says,. "The United States, when a

3

such suit, one shall be deemed to a waive any right to plead

4

state law inapplicable, or that the United States is not. amen­

5

able, thereto by reason of its sovereighty, and thereto shall

0

be subject to the judgements, orders, and decrees of the court

7

having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof, in the

3

same manner and to the same extent as a private individual

.9

under like circumstances."

There is no provision in the statute, ob­

If

viously, that relates reserve rights, makes an exception, or

12

to use a different phsase, to appropriafceve rights stem from

federal laws., Nothing in the statute of that kind,

Aq

That is correct, Your Honor,

Q

Was there any effort made to put in such

There was not. The express terms of the

under state lav/,

20
21

22

Q

Then it has that cahchacatch-ajl phrase,

■or otherwise" ,
A

That's correct, Your Honor, but what I’m

23

saying is that the terms of the statute by appropriation under

24

state law, by purchase, exchange, or otherwise is the means

25

by which a private individual can acquire the water right.
10

i

And it was that type of. tight which the United

2

States had acquired in the Quinn River situation that Senator

3

ilcCarann was concerned

4

or in that case, administration„ by the state court of Nev­

3

ada»
Q

6

about being subject to adjudication

Of course, as was suggested earlier, how

7

in argument at the time of the enactment of the McCarran Am­

3

endment the concept of the reserved rights hadn't matured, or

9

become quite so clarified as it is now, perhaps»
.There

10

had been the one case involving an Indian

t!

reservation, but the passage of that legislation long ante­

12

dated the. decision of this Court in Arizona v. California»

13

Did it not»?

14

A

That is correct, Your Honor»

15

Q

Primarily in that case--

te

A

17

But the Winters v. United States was a

landmark decision that this Court-—-

13

Q

Having to do with Indian reservations»

19

A

Yes indeed, and it was not until Arizona

20

v» California that it was extended to other federal reser­

21

vations .

22

But the concept of a right other than an appropria-

23

tive right,

a right rising by

24

reservation was well known in the water law of the West at the

2S

time of the enactment of the McCarran Amendment
11

creation of a federal

1

Now keeping in midd the intent of the sponsor, that

2

is, Senator McCarran, to subject equally the federal government

3

and private citizens to adjudication of water rights acquired

4

under state law, and the express terms of the statute designed

5

to carry out that intent, in sharp distinction

€

are reserve rightso

and contrast,

i

7

Reserved rights, as I have said arise by creation of

8

reservations automatically. They don*t require the application

8

of water to use, the priority dates from the date of with­

10

drawal, and applies to future as well as existing use.

I!

And the, in summary with respect to the legislative

12

intent, I would say that would be no -—• provision in terms

13

of the statute, in putting reserve rights, nor any specific

14

intent by the sponsor of the amendment.
If follows that it was not within the contemplation

15

16

of Congress that they be included within state court adjudi­

17

cation»
Q

18

for thejoinder

of the United

Staafces in either or both of those.
Q

It distinguishes

between the two.

1

A

Yes, Your Honor.

2

Q

And on the adjudication part it says for

3

the adjudication, that the United States may be enjoined in any

4

suit-- rights of the use of the water or river system--—

5

Wow would you think that that would be consent for someone

6

to sue the United States in a federal District Court for a

7

declaratory judgement as to whether or not the United

8

has any reserved rights in the Colorado River system?

No, Your Honor, it's a too party suit,

I don't know, but how about consent to the

z

A

With respect to a single Plaintiff-, single

person asking that the rights of the United States be declared—

3

q

---serve as a defendant anybody that they

4

think ought to be served. Including the United States. My

5

question is does this statute give consent for such a suit?

6

It seems like it would,

7

A

right in paragraph one, here.

If itas a general adjudication,

if it

8

does have the geographic and other characteristics of a

9

general adjudication—

10

Q

You don't say that this at least determined

11

the adjudication of rights part. You would n't say thatthe

12

United States has not given consent to adjudicative reserve

13

rights.

14

A

Oh, yes, I do. I think that the language

IS

of appropriation under state law applies to both the admin­

16

istration and the adjudication parts of the statute.

17
18

19

20
21

Q

So you don't think that there would be

jurisdiction in a federal court — .
A

I

believe that the reserve rights were

witheid by Congress, yes, Your Honor,
Q

Let me see if I get. that. Then you take

22

the language where it appears that the United States is the

23

owner of or is about to — more rights by appropriation under

24

state law as modifying both the adjudications, right and the

25

administrative right.
1:4

!

2

Q
supports that?

3

A

4

Q

5

You say what? That the legislative history

Yes,

Your Honor.

Well that's a crude way to construct a

statute, isn't it?

6

A

No,---

1

Q

It's

talking about in paragraph 2, it

8

says for the administration of rights where it appears the

9

United States is the owner of or is in the process of acquiring

10

rights by appropriation. Add that on to paragraph 1 and see

11

where you get. For the adjudicaiton of rights to the use of

12

the water of a river system. Where it appears that the United

13

States is the owner of or is in the process of getting water

14

rights„

15
16
17

That doesn-t make very
I won"t take

good sense, does it? Well,

up your time.

A

Yes, I think it does make sense. The adjud­

18

ication of fights acquired under state law, or in the process

19

of being acquired. My difficulty with your earlier question, Mr.

20

Justice White, is that you characterise it as a declaratory

21

judgement and I thank that would not

22

because it would not permit the assertion of contesting of the

23

water right.

Well? the proceedure

.involved is not such

7

that we think it permits a general adjudication» There

8

isn't, it just isn't within the terms of the type of proceeding

9

to which Congress consented»

10

And we are also very concenned about the Supreme

11

•Court of Colorado and its opinion with respect to the

just

12

existence of reserve rights„ which as I pointed to on the

13

map are a matter of great magnitude in both of these cases in

14

Water" Division 5, which certainly includes a great part of the

15

area of that area of Colorado,
Q

16

If it didn't recognize the United States8

17

rights, then the United States could bring the case up here

18

to us,

The

Green River decision Mr. Balcomb refers to was a ..remand decision

3

that the answer to your quesition is yes, it can be, Dugan v.

Under the

Wasnington State proceedure,

eastern part of the state, as I

remember.

Yes„ the United States could initiate a

suit as party Plaintiff.
Q

So if they were a party, and they lost

in a state case, they could appeal to the Washington Supreme
Court, then on here by Cerfciorarr, couldn’t they?
A

Yes, Your Honor, as to that case, and in

that case, that is correct, I agree.
The proceedure in Colorado underthe Water' Division

17

1

system now is quite different. It has a monthly determination.

2

Monthly , these lists are rendered to the various

3

interested persons, a person under the Colorado statute being

4

defined to include the United States.

5

Now although the continued inability of the Colorado

8

law to consider in a court rightful priorities is perhaps its

7

most basic deficiency, it*s by no means the . only one.

8
9

When the matter of adjudicating federal water rights
is considered, these deficiencies

and the burdensome nature

10

of the proceedure can best be demonstrated by a consideration

11

of the steps which Isd like to run over very quickly.
Fists t, the Water Clerk, no later than the 5th of each

12

13

month sends out this resume, and then he publishes it by the

14

10th of that month. If anyone wishes to oppose a particular

IS

application within the resume, must file with the Water Clerk

16

a verified statement of opposition,, setting forth facts why

17

it should not be granted, or it should be granted only condit­

18

ionally.

19

By the last day of the second month following the

20

month in which the application was filed, the Water Referee is

21

Water Division 5, or a Water Division, then would start con­

22

ducting a formal hearing investigates the truth of the

23

application and the opposition, and within the month following

24

the month in which the opposition was filed rules on the

25

application.
18

1

This is mailed by the Water Clerk to all persons

2

who filed either a statement or an opposition, and it becomes

3

effective upon entry subject only to judicial review.

4

So that the statute notices only those parties who

5

are interested in the applicaitons filed in a particular month,

6

the only water rights that are before the Water Referee are

7

those to which an application has been filed, and the only

3

parties are those who must take an affirmative action to be

S

heard, and so that even though the Referees proceedures are

10

extremely limited, and involove only a part of the water rights

1!

in the

12

submit is tremendous.

13

Q

14

Water Division, the burden on the United States, 1

Is it in any different position, than any­

body else that has water rights?

15

A

Except it's bigger.

IS

Within the two month period

allowed, by the statute

17

the United States must investigate all of these water rights,

18

within Water Division 5, and evaluate the impact of these

19

applications

20

and that monthly resume upon those water rights.

And that is a rather considerable task. And I submit

21

that perhaps the United States, because of the shortage of

22

time may be result to protective opposition, for lack of

23

knowledge or time, and certainly this would not contribute to

24

the orderly proceedute.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BALCOMB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
I think one of the most interesting and novel things

16

about the second case is that we say that they are identical,

17

and I think I can establish that the proceedures involved

In Colorado? Yes, sir„ They, about the

time that the United States decided that they did not want to

subject themselves to state adjudicating proceedures, there was

18

pending in the District Court for Summit County, located at

19

Breckenridge, two parallel adjudication proceedures, one to

20

adjudicate rights for irrigation, and another one to adjudicate

21

rights other than irrigation under the statute which proceeded

22

the 1943 Act which brought those two kinds of things all into

23

one action»

24

25

And then the Colorado Supreme Court ultimately held
that the government had made a voluntary appearance in those

22

proceedings and could therby be bound„
The United STates elected to bring an action which

You mean something open, -- , something

of that nature, Your Honor? I judge not

I don't wish to quarrel

\

1

with Your Honor,about not liking the word reserved, I just

2

say that it's another way of saying the initiation of a water

right.

4

And in this case If I am interpreting it correctly,

3

the Congress initiates the reserved right for an Indian reser-

the withdrawal of the land and the water.
Q

9

Yes, but they aren’t using the water for

any tiling at the moment.
A

10

Neither is the city and county of Denver,

11

Your Honor. And they claim water rights that they don’t expect

12

to put into operation until the year 200—

I've never heard that they — that took

As far as the Western —- were concerned.

17

A

Well, yes, in some respects. But there’s

They got it done.

18

nothing in the law which prohibits the acquisition of the right

'19

20

the need.

21

The eventual c\eed; as the

Colorado Supreme

22

Court held, the Court could not question Denvers projection

23

about population. Nor do I think that the trial Court really

24

questioned the allegations and proof by the United States that

25

of the eventual need for water on their reservation.

25

I

2

Q

That would just be a matter, I suppose,

to be properly governed by federal lav/?

3

A

Yes, and in reality, I think they'd, have

4

little problem with most of them, because in almost every cir­

S

cumstance , the water and the water right involved are totally

6

within the federal reservation„

7

You would have to have their permission to do any­

8

thing anybody else did, here with it, and they have complete

9

control.
As I say, the objection in 87, relating to size of

the water course, and yet in every situation, for practical

purposes except Arizona v. California, where the United

In the instant case it seems to relate to how much

I would observe that-—*

Q

Mr. Baleomb, could I ask you another

question, please? If the United States wanted to remove, let's

24

assume that you're right about this.

25

A

Yes, sir.

26

1

2

Q

The United States then wanted to fcemove

the case to the federal Court.

3

A

There are several decisions in whichin

4

some cases they held that the right of removal

sent, in some they said the right of removal was exercised as

6

a premature exercise, but might come back after a clear

There was a removable provision inthe bill,

Q

Mr. Balcomb, what’s your answer to the

10

governments submission that both the adjudication and the admin­

11

istration forces are qualified by the provision as to appro-

12

priative rights?

13

A

It speaks of the United States in two

14

categories, I believe, one is the owner of the water rights,

15

and the second category is the acquisition of these other

IS

methods

And when the United States is owner, they can be

17
18
10

in acquiring ownership of water rights.

joined.
Q

Well, what I had Reference to, though,

20

is that, as I understand the argument, reserved rights are

21

not embraced by the consent statute. And because I thought that

22

your collegue argued that both cause one, the adjudication

23

rights, and. cause two the administration of such rights, are

24

qualified by the provision where it appears that the United

25

States is the owner of and is in the process of acquiring water

28

rights by appropriation?, under state law.

2

Jt

1 think this does have a possible-—

3

Q

Do you agree with that?

A

1 agree with the governments position?

5

Q

Yes*

6

A

I think that it covers everything, is my

7

position, Your Honor*

8

Q

That it covers reserved rights, too?

9

A

That's csrrect.

10

Q

Whatever-- -

11

12

Q

You say it covers everything* You mean

both clauses one and two cover everything, or only clause one

Both of them*

24
25

Q

Yes, but I thought the governments argument

was that the adjudication of rights does not include the adjud-

29

1

icafcion of reserved rights»

2

A

I know——

3

Q

This, because the clause dealing with

4

the administration of therights, the government argues, is

5

limited to water rights by appropriation under state law.

6

A

Well the first one is meaningless» I think

7

I read two circumstances: either the United States is the

a

owner and there is an adjudication in progress or the United

9

States is the owner and like in the -—* situation, there is

10

an administrative process.

right is--

And I might further say that if Congress had really

to say so.

cedures in Colorado and the United States, that keeps it from

15

being a general adjudication.
And it keeps the certainty of water rights out of

16
17

the law entirely, because, as they indicate, we have large

13

areas which are shown on the map, and we’re entitled to use

19

the water certain ways, and we want to keep it a secret until

20

such time as we decide to put it to work, and in the meantime

21

no one else can do anything with the w7ater at all with any

22

certainty,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER KIECHEL, JR.., ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

3
4

MR. KIECHELs Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

6

Q

What about this removal thing? Do you

agree that it might be——

7

A

There—

8

Q

-- removed as quickly as Mr. Balcomb says ?

9

A

I wish I could be as confident is saying—

10

Q

11

A

Have you ever tried it?
Yes, we have, Your Honor, it was tried

12

in the in re Green River case, and there, in a lengthy opinion,

13

Judge Christensen, in that court held it not to be removable.
There was, in the legislative history, as has been

14
15

pointed out, a specific right of removal, which was stricken.
Q

16

17

What were the rights claimed by the United

States in that litigation?
A

Those ware rights, includingreserved

20

Q

Including reserved rights.

21

A

—on federal forests, national

22

And there has been, I can't, there .have been certain

18
19

rights——

forests.

23

cases removed,

under this statate, but most of those have

24

been where the government officers have been joined. Of course

25

under the Federal Removal Statute, there is a fair right to

40

1

remove one in which a government officer is a party defendant»

2

With respect to the proceedure in Colorado, the

3

monthly proceedure under the" 1969 Act, Mr. Balcomb makes a

4

point that it is subject to judicial review, and I would point

5

out, however, that this requirement which is continufced, or this

6

prohibition, which is continued in Colorado law, where by

7

no

8

adjudication applies to the judge, as well as it does to the

9

Referee.

JO

prior right, can be awarded in a supplemental, ongoing

And it’s not just the burdensome nature of that month™

SI

ly proceedute that i.3 of concern with respect to the

12

legislative intent on 666,

it is relevant to that.

13

But it is the fact that it is more administrative

14

than judicial. Now I think its quite clear that Congress in

15

enacting the statute, saying that the United States could be

16

joined had that in mind, a judicial proceeding.

17

And so I would say, with respect to that question

18

about the conduct of the United States as Plaintiff, that

19

what the United States does as Plaintiff is not despositive of

20

the issue before the Court, that is, what kind of a proceeding

21

Congress consented to the joinder

22

party defendant.

23

of the united States as

I will say, however, that in.addition to that, that

24

the United States found out the hard way about a general

25

adjudication. That it did^_ in the Fallbrook litigation I referred
\\

41

I

to earlier on the Santa Marguerita River9 undertake t© bring

2

the kind of an action Mr® Justice White-embodied in a ques­

3

tion earlier®
That is an action against only the principal user»

4
5

and it was there determined9

6

this is a case brought by the United States as. a Plaintiff9 but

7

the Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit told us very loudly

8

and cSearly, that they way in which adjudication could be done

9

was to join all water users on that water system and have a*

10

this is cot a 66S ease,

contest a determination among all users®
Q

11

Are you suggesting that we have t© decide

12

in this case whether the Colorado proeeedute is a judicial

13

or an administrative preceedure?

14

A

I'm saying—

15

Q

In order to decide the ------ consent statute,

16

A

I'm saying? Hr® Justice Brennan*, that

17

Congress intended to consent to the joinderiof the United

18

States only in judicial proceedings®
Q

19

We11, now* accepting that

premisee are

20

you suggesting that we have to decide whether this Colorado

21

proceedsre? in this case was or was not a judicial proceedure?
A

22

Yes„ 1 think that you can decide by

23

reference to the Colorado Act, it is an administrative pro-

24

ceedore®

25

Q

But. you're suggesting that we have to
42

i

decide whether it is or it isn't. A judicial proceeding*

2

A

Yes

3

Q

If

3

in—

we accept yporpremise thatCongress

4

meant the consent statute to apply only in judicial pro­

5

ceedings.

6

A

Yes

7

Q

By What means would

3

Yfiur Honor.
youthink that

you

8

might prevail in one case* and qot in the other? You might

9

prevail in the case you’re now arguing., and lose the other

1.0
11

one.,
A

No

9

I thick there are good and sufficient

12

reasons, different reasons for prevailing in both casesr

13

if Your Honor please„ the first case as was discussed invol­

14

ved the matter of the

IS

in the second case—

16

Q

river system,, that is not involved

I realise that* but as far as the admin­

17

istrative part of your argument is concerned,, we regard

18

this case as different from the other ease.

19

A

Well, I thick that the common deasomin-

20

Sor with respect to Colorado law* that is, that the Colorado

21

Sater Courts whether it be Water Division 5^ or Water Dis­

22

trict-. #379 cannot accord the United States its true prioritys

23

its rightful priority for its water rightsp is a food and

24

sufficient hasis for concluding that Congress ecuId mt

25

have intended to subject the United States t© either such
43

1

proceedure.

2

Q

So indother words, putting lay brother

3

Harlans question a little different way, if you prevailin the

4

first case on the basic arguments, then you also prevail in

5

the second case, and we need not reach any question of whether

S

it's judicial

7

A

8

Q

S

or administrative., Right?
Yes, Your Honor.
May I ask you to state exactly what the

government has at stake if it looses this case?

10

A

If the government looses--™

ri

Q

If the government looses——

12

A

This case——

13

Q

What does it lose?

14

©

It looses the, under our view, the Colorado

15

Supreme Court opinion, possibly its right to present, submit,

16

and proove up on reserved rights of the United States.

17

Q

You

18

A

That's quite strongly suggested by the

19

mean they could cut off your rights?

Colorado Supreme Court.
That depends on what we hold as an opinion.

20
21

A

Yes, Your Honor.

22

U

Mr. Balcomb didn't seem to think you would

23

lose that right. He and you do not quite agree on the reading

24

of the Colorado Supreme Court opinion of that-—-

25

A

I'm quite concerned, if it please Mr. Chief
44

1

Justice that the Supreme Court of Colorado has referred to the

2

reserved rights of the United States as mysterious and causing

3

chaos and in other words which indicates certainly hostility

4

toward those rights.

3

Q

6

A

No, Your Honor, they are not»

7

Q

Well they were until you sat down and quan­

8

9
10
11

Well, they are rather mysterious»

tified them»
A

Well, they were quantified in Arizona v«

California, and™
Q

Well, I know, but could you find up until

12

this time any quantification of your rights, what you say

13

your reserved rights are in the Eagle Biver system?

14

A

Well, sir,™ until there is a determination

15

or science permits a determination of how oil shale can be

16

recovered or how oil can be recovered b=ffrom shale in con-

17

mercial quantities it’s not known how much wafcar will be

18

required for that reserve»

19

Q

Maybe mysterious isn't the word, btit—

20

A

Undetermined»

21

a

22

That's a very good example but it is a very,

an unknown.

23

A

Undetermined in certain instances»

24

Q

That's right»

25

Q

If they had used terms like "uncertain'5 and

45

1

"undetermined" in court, you wouldn't he quite as disturbed as

2

by the invidious implications that you get out of mysterious,

3

would you?

4

A

I agree =

5

Q

Very well, thank you, Mr. Kiechel, thank
