MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We'll hear

5

against Lincoln Sayings and Loan Association.

Mr. Zinn, you may proceed whenever you're ready,
ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J„ ZINN, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

11

MR, ZINN: Mr. Chief Justice and may
it please the Court.
This federal income tax case is here on a Writ of

12

Certiorari to the Cocrfc of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It

13

raises a question that affects the tax liability of every

14

savings and loan association that insures its depositors ac­

15

counts with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Aorporation.

16

Respondent is such an association.

17

During 1963, the only taxable year at issue, it paid

18

a regular annual insurance premium for depositors insurance to

19

the insurance corporation, amounting to approximately $135,000,

20

This payment was required by Seciton 404 (b) of the

21

National Housing Act, and the Commissioner allowed it as an

22

ordinary and necessary business expense deduction under Section

23

162 (a) of the Internal Revsnue Code. The treatment of this

24

payment is not in dispute.

25

Also during 1963^ Respondent contributed an additional

4

1

$882*000 to the insurance corporation. This contribution was

a

required by Section 404 (d) of the National Housing Act* and

3

it is described in the statute as being in the nature of a

4

prepayment with respect to future premiums.

5

The question presented here is whether the $882*000

6

is an ordinary and necessary business expense

or 1963 on the

7

ground that it is simply an additional cost fof current in­

8

surance as Respondent claims or whether as the Commissioner

9

urges the $882,000 is a capital expenditure* which is deduc-

10

tible in future years if actually used to pay Respondents

11

regular annual insurance premiums or to meet insurance losses

12

of the insurance corporation.
In other words * the basis question here is not whether

13
14

a deduction should be allowed* but when a deduction should be

15

allowed.

16

Q

Does it have to be one ot the other?

17

A

Ho* Mr. Justice.

18

Q

Is it an ordinary business expense or a

19

capital expenditure? Frankly I have trouble seeing how it fit

20

into the statutory definition of either.

21

A

Mr. Justice

22

capital expenditure-—

23

Q

24
25

let me deal first with the

--don't have to decide this case * but I

wondered if those are the only two possible-—■
A

Oh. Let me statt with capital expenditure.
5

1

2

The term capital expenditure appears and is defined
in section 263 of the Code—-

3

Q

And it doesn't fit that definitione

4

A

Riijht. That issue has been dealt with ex­

5

plicitly by Hr. Justice Blackmun when he sat on the Eighth Cir­

6

cuit, in a case called General Bank Shares Corporation, which

7

is not cited in either of the briefs but was cited below and it

8

was reported at 326 Fed. 2nd.

9

Thera Mr. Justice Blackmun, speaking for a unanimous

10

eighth Circuit in a case in which this Court subsequently

?i

denied Certiorari, said this about Section 263:

12

263, with its denial of deductibility, for specified capital

13

expenditures, and Section 162

14

for ordinary and necessary business expenses are not, of course,

15

mutually exclusive. Neither are they together all inclusive.

16

Section 263 obviously is not in itself an exclusive list of

17

non-deductible capital expenditures,"

18

"Section

(a), with its grant of deductibilit

Apart from Mr. Justice Blackmans comments in that

19

case, this Court only last term, in two unanimous decisions, in

20

the Woodward and (Hilton) cases, held that appraisal expenses

21

incurred in connection with evaluation of dissenting share hold­

22

ers stock, were non-deductible capital expenditures, but they,

23
24
25

too, are not new buildings or permaneat improvements or better­
ments. And the Court did this, of course, without mention
of the fact that Seciton 263 has only a limited definition.

6

So I think it's fair to say, Mr. Justice, that this

1

a

Court has on innumerable occasions donfe that.

s

Q

4

A

At least once.
No, on innumerable occasions, as early as

5

1938, in Helvering v. Winmill, it held that brokerage expenses

6

in the acquisition of capital stock, are capital expenditures,

7

to be added to the cost of the stock.

8

Q

9

A

And that increases the basis.
Yes, sir. And capital stock itself, Mr.

10

Justice, is not described in Section 263, but we nevertheless

11

don’t allow a deduction for it.

IE

And so—

13

Q

For what?

14

A

Capital stock. If I go out and buy some——■

15

Q

For the purchase of-—

16

A

That’s right,.For the purchase

ofcapital

'

1J
18

stfcck. It is a capital expenditure, which at least temporatily
cannot be deducted.
Q

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

263

But a capital expenditure, as defined in

(a) at least those definitions and under ejusdem generis

other similar ones would not be the kind dealt with last term
in Woodward, not would they be the kind coming under in the
general category of brokerage fees.
A.

No, the—

Q

But would be expenditures

7

that could be

1

depreciated annually. Depreciated. That's what 263 (a) says

2

to me.

3

A

I'm not prepared to say whether 263 could

4

also include a non-depreciable asset, but I don't think it

5

really matters.

s

The point is that I think it's clear that capital

7

expenditures are more broadly defined than in Section 263 that

8

this Court, and so far as I know, all courts, have consistently

9

subscribed to that, we don't think it's any real bar to our

10

position here that the cost that we're talking about here are

11

not described in Section 263.

12

Q

Well really perhaps what I'm asking is

13

very consistent with the language that you read to us from

14

Justice Blacfcmuns opinion in the Eighth Circuit. Is it nec­

15

essary to your argument when you say that these expenditures

IS

do not come under 162 (a), is it necessary for you to say that

17

they do come under 263 (a)?

18

A

I don’t think it is, Your Honor.

19

Q

You just have to stop with the first one,

A

Right, Mr. Justice, and that's what the

20
21

22

don11 you?

Court did in the Woodward and (Hilton) case--”

23

Q

You don't need to say that they're capital

24

expenditures, do you?

25

A

We did not cite Section 263 in our brief.
8

1

Q

I know you didn't.

a

A

But——

3

Q

Then you don't need

4

capital expenditures.

5

A

tosay that

they're

Ho. We call them capital outlays, I don’t

6

think that the verbage is important. The question is what they

7

really are. And we don't--Q

3
■9

Well, what they really are,

ofcourse,

depends on the verbage of the Internal Hevenue Bill.
A

10

Well, we rely on verbage of the Treasury

M

regulations, Section 1.461 which appears on pages 41 and 42 of

12

our brief, and reads, in pertinent part, that if an expenditure

13

results in the creation of an asset, having a useful life,

14

which extends substantially beyond the close of the taxable

15

year, such an expenditure

18

H

tible, or may be deductible only in part for the taxable year
in which made.
Perhaps it would be helpful if I point out why it

13

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

may not be deduc­

is that we capitalize anything. Why do we capitalize buildings?
Now——
Q

Would you mind giving me the name of Justice

Blackmuns case?
A

Yes, sir. It!s General Bank Shares Cor­

poration against The Commissioner, 326, Fed.2nd, 712, and the
material that I quoted was at 716.

S

1

The reason why we require the capitalization of

2

anything,, as I was saying, in our judgement, is that if you

3

didn't capitalize, you would be charging against the income of

4

a single year cost of an asset that was going to benefit a num­

5

ber of future years. In the case of a building, for example--

6

Q

And a building will depreciate over its-—

7

A

As you recover--

8

Q

-- useful life.

9

A

10

Q

11

As you recover its costs.
Land you don't depreciate and shares of

stock you don't depreciate.

12

A

But I was---

13

Q

—a matter of your basis.

14

A

Right. But the point is that, we require

15

capitalization in the first instance because to charge the

16

whole thing off would destroy the income.
And I would suggest to this Court, Mr. Justice, that

17
18

we'd have precisely the same rules if there were no

Section

19

263 in the Internal Revenue Code, because Section

20

Internal Revenue Code requires that income be reported clearly,

2!

and It seems to us that a clear reflection of income in the

22
23
24
.25

446 of the

case of a cost that’s going to benefit future years and can
properly be described as an asset within the meaning of the
regulation that I have quoted, is one that should not be deduc­
ted

currently.
10

t

Q

I think perhaps all of my problems are

z

caused by your characterizing this as a capital expenditure.

•c*

You don't need to , you simply need to argue that it§s not

4

deductible under 162 (a)»

S

A

Right, but we didn't refer to capital ex­

6

penditure in the sense of the statute, but in the sense use

7

by *4r. Justice Blackmun.
At all relevant times, Respondent has been a member

8
9
10

of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and has insured
its depositors accounts with the Insurance Corporation.
Prior to 1962, Respondent was required to own stock

11
12

in its Federal Home Loan Bank in an amount at least equal to

13

2% of its mortgage loans, and to maintain this percentage of

14

ownership.

15

Respondent has always capitalized its purchases of

16

such stodk. Also prior to 1962, it was required to pay an

1?

annual insurance premium to the Insurance Corporation of1/12

13

of 1% of all insured accounts and creditor obligation

19

This expanse, corresponding to the$135,000 premium of

20

1963, has always been allowed as an ordinary and necessary busi­

21

ness expense by the commissioner.

22

In 1961, Congress changed these requirements, effective

23

January 1, 1962, This change resulted in the present litigation.

24

First, Congress reduced the stock ownership requirement in the

25

Federal Home Loan Bank from 2% to 1% of mortgage loans.
11

1

Second, it continued the regular annual premium re­

a

quirement of 1/12 of 1% of savings accounts and creditor ob­

3

ligations.

4

And third, it imposed a nev; requirement in Section

5

404

(d) that in certain years, each insured institution con­

0

tribute 2% of any increase ift its savings accounts and creditor

7

obligations during the preceding year to the Insurance Corpor­

8

ation,
Congress

9

thought that the additional contributions

10

required under Section 404

11

larger stock purchases that would have been made under the

12

prior act.

13

(d) would be about the same as the

Indeed, if a savings and loan association has to

14

purchase any stock to meet the

IS

ligation under Section 404

16
17
18

lower 1% requirement, its ob­

(d) is reduced by that amount.

Regular insurance premiums recieved by the Insurance
Corporation are part of its gross income to the extent that
the Corporation does not use them to meet its current expenses

19

and losses, they are transferred to the Insurance Corporations

20

primary reserve, which the Corporation is directed to establish

21

in the National Housing Act,

22
23

24
25

That reserve contains its cumulative net income and
is available to meet losses if income of any year is xnsuffic lent. Section 404

(d) contributions, on the other hand, ones thai

are here in dispute, are not considered part of the insurance

12

1

companies’ gross income and are not added to its primary reserve.
They are transferred

2

directly to the Insurance Cor­

3

porations’ secondary reserve, which the Insurance Corporation

4

also is directed to establish in the National Housing Act.

5

Unlike the primary reserve, this secondary reserva is not freely

6

available to meet expenses and losses of the current year. It

7

may be used only to meet losses and only if all of the Corpor­

8

ations other accounts are first exhausted.
Once Respondent makes a regular annual premium payment

9
10

that payment is lest to it. The premium obligates the Corporatior

11

only to provide insurance coverage for the current year.

12

On the other hand, the contributions to the Corpor­

13

ations secondary reserve create a beneficial interest in that

U

reserve. This interest is evidenced by annual statements which

15

the Insurance Corporation sends to each insured institution,

16

each year, advising it of its then current share of the secon­

17

dary reserve.
Respondents share of the reserve amounted to nearly

IS

19

$5 million, as of the end of 1967. This share consists not

20

only of the contribution made by the insured institution but.

21

also includes an annual return on investment at a rate equal

22

to the teturn earned by the Corporation on its investments.

23
24
25

Q

Now that is credited to the individuals

A

That’s right, Mr. Justice. The rate is av-

account„

13

1
2
3

4
5

eraged 3 to 4k%
Q

annualy, roughly»
Now are the 4 (d) payments annual or are

they terminated when the reserve gets to be a certain amount?
A

If you could hold off, I'm just coming to

that» This is a rather complicated background, as you know—■-

6

Q

Yes.

7

A

-““and I’m trying to give the picture—

8

Q

All right.

9

A

1©

---in the way I think will make it simplest

to the Court.

3?

Q

I’m sorry.

12

A

Although an insured institutions interest

13

in the secondary reserve is not generally transferable, an

14

association may transfer its share in a merger, consolidation,,

15

or other similar transaction. Moreover, an association is en­

16

titled to a cash refund of its share, if it withdraws from the

17

Federal Insurance system, or if it goes into voluntary or in­

18

voluntary liquidation.

19

I come now to consider haw an associations share in

2©

a secondary reserve is built up and. how it is used to pay re­

21

gular annual insurance premiums.

22

Contributions to the secondary reserve, the ones that

23

are here in dispute, must be made until the primary and se­

24

condary reserves together equal 2% of all savings accounts and

25

creditor obligations of all insured institutions. When that point
14

■

J

1

is reached,, the obligation to make secondary reserve contri­

z

butions is temporarily suspended.
While it remains suspended, an associations share in

3
4

a secondary reserve is used to pay its regular annual insurance

5

premium. This reduces its share in the secondary reserve.
Now if a particular savings and loan association

6
7

has no remaining share in the secondary reserve, while the on-

8

ligation to make contributions to the secondary reserve is

9

generally suspended, it pays its annual insurance premium in

10

11

cash.
The use of shares in the secondary reserve to discharge

IE

the regular annual insurance premiums continues until the total

13

of the primary and secondary reserves falls below 1 3/4 % of

14

all insured accounts and creditor obligations.

15

Q

Hr. Zinn, when the secondary reserve is so

IS

used to pay insurance premiums, does the S

17

deduction, at that point?

18

A

19

q

20

A

&

L then get a

Yes, Mr.—for the amount used?
For the amount that is taken out of the

21

secondary reserve and transferred to the primary reserve to pay

22

the regular annual preraium for that year.

23

24
25

Q
Q

That's my question.
' (immediately following) Just like af they

paid the premium in cash.
15

1

A

Exactlyt because they don't have to pay

2

it in cash when they pay it out of their share of the secondary

3

reserve.

4

That's why 1 stress the point. If a particular as­

5

sociation doasn91 have any share in the secondary reserve, it9 s

6

going to have to come up with the money in cash instead of that

7

share.

8

Q

But the termination of the use of the

9

secondary reserve to pay premiums isn't keyed to individual

10

companies, it’s keyed to the total of primary and secondary

11

reserves.

12

A

That's for the gereral obligation, but each

13

individual company is stuck with it's own secondary reserve.

14

For example, if you have-—-

IS

Q

I understand5 if the primary and secondary

16

reserva remain above 1 3/4% and some companies secomdary re­

17

serve is sero8 then it has to pay.

18

A

It has to come up with the money, right.

19

Contributions to the secondary reserve are renewed

20

as I have said, when the total of the two reserves falls below

21

1 3/4%. At that time, and until the total again reaches 2%,

22

contributions to the secondary reserve must be made.

23

Contributions to the Secondary reserve are permanently

24

terminated when the primary reserve alone reaches the 2% level.

25

Regular insurance premiums must be paid annually, either in cash,
16

i

or through use of an associations share in the secondary re­

2 serve until the primary reserve alone reaches 2% of -all insured
3 accounts and creditor obligations„ of all insured institutions.
When it does, any association whose full share in the

4
3

secondary reserve has not been used to pay regular premiums,

6

is entitled to a cash refund of its remaining share, Thereafter,

7 regular premiums must be paid whenever the primary reserve
S

falls below the 2% level.
All that this Court needs to understand about this

9
10

complicated arrangement is, that in some years, like 1963, an

11

association will be making regular premium payments in cash,

12

and also contributing to the secondary reserve in cash. In

13

other years, for example this year, it will make no cash pay­

14 ments, and its regular annual premium will be paid out of its
15

share of the secondary reserve,
I think the matter can be further clarified if we look

16

17

at what has actually happened since 1962 when this scheme went

18

into effect. From 1962 through 1969, Respondent paid regular

1©

premiums in cash and also made contributions to the secondary

20

reserve,

21

In its view it is entitled to two deductions in each

22

of those years. We say that only the regular annual premium is

23

deductible, By the end of 1969, the total of the primary and

24

secondary reserves reached thd 2% level. Consequently, the ob­

25

ligation to make payments to the secondary reserve was suspended,
17

i

and Respondents regular annual premium was paid out of its

2

share of the secondary reserve in 1970.
It will continue to be paid out of the secondary

4

reserve this year, and for the next several years. Respondents

5

position is that no deduction should be allowed during these

6

years. We say that a deduction should be allowed for the regular

7

annual premium.

8

In short, under Respondents method, deductions for

9

insurance coverage would be hunched in the years in which it

10

makes contributions to the secondary reserve. Under our method

11

the cost of the insurance would be spread over the entire

12

period by allowing a deduction each year for the regular an­

13

nual premium, irrespective of whether it is paid in cash, or

14

out of an associations share of the secondary reserve.
The tax court upheld the governments position in a

15

16

unanimous review decision, that these payments into the secon­

17

dary reserve constituted capital outlays, if I may use that

18

word.

19

The Ninth Circuit reversed in a two to one decision.

20

As I have said before our position here is based on the Trea­

21

sury Regulations that I quoted, and these regulations are nbt

22

challenged by the Respondent, they are not cited by the Res­

23

pondent in their brief, and they require that the government

24

show two requirements.

25

First, that an asset has been created, and second,
18

1

that that asset has a useful life extending beyond the close

2

of the taxable year»

S
4
5
6
7

Now we think this is shown by the undisputed facts
in this case»
Q

Where do I find that regulation that you

were reading?
A

On page 41 of our brief

Mr, Justice,, roughly

8

half way down. We say that Respondent acquired an asset because

9

it had an identifiable interest in the secondary reserve, evi­

ID

denced by the annual atatements furnished by the Insurance

11

Corporation. It is something that Respondent owns. It is

12

transferable„ in limited circumstances, to another. It earns

13

interest each year, based on the interest earned by the In­

14

surance Corporation.

15

And it has real value, which would be recognized, for

16

example, if Respondents parent corporation were to sell its

17

stock in Respondent to another.

18

We think it is clear that the_ buyer would pay more

19

for Respondents stock than it would for the stock of another

20

savings and loan association that was in all other respects,

2!

similarly situated to Respondent, except that it had no interest

22

in the secondary reserve.

23

We also believe it is clear that Respondents secondary

24

reserve interest will provide a future benefit to Respondent,

25

and thus that it has a useful life extending beyond the close

ARGUMENT OF ADAM Y. BESKIN ION, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BENNION: Mr. Chief Justice, and raay

9
10

it please the Court.
We are certaibly in agreement with the governraebt

11
12

here that this question not to turn upon what the payments

13

in question really are or were. It is the taxpayers position

14

that in essence the payments were primarily insurance pre­

15

miums , and constitufc ad ordinary and necessary business ex­

16

penses .
To go back to 1961 when the legislation in questipn

17
18

was introduced, each association was required to pay an in­

19

surance premium of 1/12 of 1% of the savings accounts and cre­

20

ditors obligations. I will not keep repeating creditors obli­

21

gations, but I refer to them by including them in savings ac­

22

counts .

23

Had the savings and loan industry remained static,

24

those insurance premiums of 1/12 of 1% would have produced

25

a 2% reserve in approximately 24 years, but of course, with

21

1

the tremendous growth of the savings and loan associations , to

2

continue to collect only 1/12 of 1% did not keep pace with the

3

ultimate insurance risk which the statute has imposed on the

4

F„S.LJ,C.

5

And therefore, Congress, when it introduced the Act

6

in question, stated in both of the committee reports that there

7

was general agreement that the some action should be taken to

8

build up the Corporations reserves at a faster rate after

9

pointing out the extent to which they had declined.

'30

And therefore the legislation took the form of con­

11

tinuing the premium of 1/12 of 1% but the additional element

12

that was then introduced was that if any association had an

13

increase in its savings deposits it would have to pay this ad­

14

ditional premium of 2% of the amount of the increase.

15
16
17
18
19
20

And to us it is sigmificant that this is right in
line with the element of a premium for insurance. It's an
attemp to measure the cost of protection by the increased risk
that the insurance company is put to.
For example, in our particular case, Lincolns savings
accounts at the beginning of 1962 amounted to approximately

21

$90 million, and they increased during 1962 to over $135 million

22

with the result that the potential insurance risk of the F.S.L.

23
24
25

I.C. which it was obliged by law to insure, was increased by
$44 million.
And to us the essence of what Congress required was

22

1

that because of the additional insurance risk thus imposed upon

2

the F.S.Ld-C., there should be paid a 2% of that increase

3

as a premium.

4

Not a premium to take effect 10 years later when there

5

might be a bookkeeping entry transferring an amount from a

6

secondary reserve to a primary reserve, but an insurance risk

7

that was assumed immediately in 1962 because of the increased

8

savings accounts of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.

9

So therefore, it seems to us that basically the

10

nature and the substance of what we paid was a premium measured

n

directly to the increased insurance risk assumed by the F.S.L.L

t2

C. and therefore it meets basically the criteria

13

ary expense.

of an ordin­

14

On the other hand there undoubtedly may have been

15

associations which experienced no increase in their savings

16

deposits.As to such an association there would have been no

17

increased insurance risk assumed by the F.S.L.I.C.

18

There would have been no increased premium paid by

19

such an association. Which to us gives further illustration of

20

the fact that this really was in essence the payment for in­

2!

surance risks.

22
23
24
25

Q

Mr. Bennion, are you then making an ad hoc

approach to the taxpayers concern? You seem to draw a distinc­
tion between one whose deposits had increased substantially and
one whose deposits had not increased substantially. Do I under23

1

tand you to imply, 1 don't think you said it flatly, that for

2

the latter one there would be no deduction?

3

A

That is true, Your Honor, because there

4

woulfi be no payment due» In other words, if an association did

5

ntt increase its deposits it would pay nothing more than the

6

original 1/12 of 1%. It would not pay this 2% and therefore,

?

having paid nothing, if of course, could be entitled to no

8

deduction.

9

10

The government has argued that by this approach—
Q

Let me carry on one more issue. What, then,

11

is the statutory approach in setting out both 404 (b) and 404

12

why do you think they're separated?

13

A

(d) ,

-This would have to be my own personal op­

14

inion because I cannot climb into the minds of Congress, but I

15

think it was primarily a device to bring about fairness. The

16

plan of the insurance statute from the very beginning has been

17

that there will come a time when the reserves reach a certain

18

point when all payment of insurance premiums will be suspended.

19

Under the original Act it was

5% and then it was

20

reduced to 2%. So there had been inherent in every payment, in

21

every premium the possibility of a future benefit, when that,

22

reserve reached that point.

23

Now I personally think that the reason they adopted

24

this complicated formula' and said we'll charge the growing as­

25

sociations an additional 2%, was that whan the combined primary

o

a

t

and secondary reserves should reach 2% and therefore there should

2

be a suspension of pciyments, under the Congressional determina-

3

tion that 2% was high enough to cover the risk.
That early suspension would be available only to the

4
5

growing associations which had paid this additional premium,

6

whereas, if you had an association which had paid no secondary

7

premiums and there fore had no secondary account, there would

8

be nothing to transfer on their account and therefore they „

9

would have to continue to pay the 1/12 of 1% premium until the

10

primary premium by itself got to be 2%.
And I believe that that is the only reason for this

f1
12

exceedingly- technical anc complicated formula which was set

13

up just as a matter of fairness and I think it is fair. I think

14

that the associations that have been growing and have been

15

building up this fund and paying insurance, when the 2% was

IS

arrived at which Congress thought was sufficient, that's fine.

17

Let’s give these associations a little bit of surcease while

18
19

20

I the

others who have not been contributing will continue until

all of the funds are transferred over to the primary reserve.
Q

As I understood you to say, and as I under­

2!

stand the law, the Section 404 (d) payments are to be made

22

only by institutions whose depository increases.

23
24
25

A

That is correct.

Q

If they’re not increasing there are no 404

(d) payments to be made.
25

1

A

2

Wow from a practical standpoint, , the government has

That's correct.

3

referred to this transfer of a part of the Lincolns account from

4

the secondary reserve to the primary reserve as an event which

5

should give rise to ei deduction at that time and also which

6

prevents a distortion of income.

7

I'd like to just call your attention to what seems to

8

me to be a true distortion of income,, Under the governments

9

theory, and as the government says this transfer statted as far

10

as Lincoln is concerned, in 1970. Under the governments theory

11

the original payment of this $800,000 although it was completely

12

beyond the control of the taxpayer, and in our view had gone

13

for insurance, is set up on the taxpayers books as an asset.
Now in 1970, when the whole industry reserve gets up

14
15

to 2% and instead of having to pay.the original 1/12 of

te

the taKpayer has the benefit of having transferred, let's say

i?

$500,000 from the secondary reserve to the primary reserve.

18

This has the effect on the financial status of the taxpayer,

19

of telling the public that its net worth has now decreased to

20

$500,000.

1%,

2!

And yet from a practical standpoint the day before

22

that transfer was made and the day after it was made, we had

23

exactly the same net worth as far as anybody could fell from th

24

the outside it’s worth exactly what it was, and yet under the

25

governments treatment you show a decrease in net worth of a half
26

1

a million dollars.

2

Q

Yes but there will be a half a million dol­

3

lars less expense that would normally be recorded as an ex­

4

penditure,

5

A

No, Your Honor, because under the govern­

5

ments theory the expense is allowable in that year even though

7

no payment is due,

8

Q

Why—

9

A

If I understood Your Honors point. But it—

10

Q

Well, I know, but you actually haven51 put

li

put any money for it,

i2

A

that is correct.

13

Q

Well, in another year you would have had

14

to actually deplete the resources of the company by a half a

13

million dollars.

18

A

n

Q

18

value, I would think.

19

A

20

Q

21

22

It seems to--So you just end up with the same asset

No, I think,—
In a different account, but I think it would

end up the same way.
A

The way it has worked out as the accountants

23

have worked it out for us is that if by deducting, in other words

24

by writing off this asset out of the secondary reserve which

23

appears as an asset on the balance sheet—

27
J

1

Q

That is reducing the 886 by 500,000?

2

A

Yes =

3
4

This is the way your accountants would
handle it?

5

A

Yes, this is the way the government would

6

handle it, and this is the way we are required to do it by our

7

regulatory agency.
Q

8
9

In other words the asset which had appeared

at 886 would now appear at 386?

10

A

That's right.

11

Q

Well what about the half million that is

12

iow a deductible expenxe? By reason of the transfer—what happens

13

bo that?

14

A

It's just allowed as a deduction.

15

Q

But tarrifs would have been paid up for

16

chose premiums, otherwise, or still is in your cash register.

M

A

Well, that’s true, Your Honor.

18

Q

Well, so it's a washout, isn't it?

1©

A

I wish I were a better accountcint, but the

20
21

*/ay our accountants have explained it—
Q

Well -wouldn’t it work out that way because

22

If your cash balance had shown 2% million dollars but you had

23

lad to pay out a half million, your cash balance would be 2

24
25

nillion. Plus 886. So now it's 2 million 5 hundred plus 386, isn9
it? So it’s exactly the same thing. Isn't it?

28

1

A

2

Q

It sounds reasonable anyway* doesn't it?

3

A

Yes* sir. Now the government has placed

I must say that sounds right* Your Honor,

4

stress upon this question on the fact that the secondary return

5

earns a rate of return which the statute requires the F. .L.I.C,

6

to credit to the secondary accounts.

7

And it is true that the law does require such a ere™

8

dit, we have gone through in our brief the presentation in the
committee hearings by one of the savings and loan people who

10

was unhappy that this return was not going to be paid in cash

11

but nothing happened with that.

12

And from the standpoint of the taxpayer, it is seen

13

to us that this so-called return is really an illusory thing.

14

It is credited to—

15

Q

What’s it supposed to realised from?

18

A

The F. .L.I.C., Your Honor, has invested

17

most of its asset money in government bonds and by and large its

18

income consists of the returns.
Q

19

o that this means that if your contribu­

20

tions were a half a million dollars to the secondary reserve*

21

and the secondary reserve had earned enough so that that half

22

million now becomes$525,000, is that it?

23

A

24

Q

25

Yes,
Now do you have to return the $25,000 as

income?
29

1

A

Hot in the year —, Your HOnor, actually

2

what happens is the F.S.L.X.C. does not earmark its bonds as

3

between primary and secondary, it reports all of its investment

4

income as income and theft it deducts from that whatever return

5

is credited to the secondary—

6
7
8
9

to

Q

Does that $886,000 on your balance sheet in-

elude any increment in the secondary reserve by reason of—
A

No. The 886 is just dolely the amount we

paid in the year 1963. The account has subsequently been cre­
dited with this increment.

1?

Q

I see.

12

A

But the, and so the amount as credited to

13

the secondary is then split up into the various savings and

14

loans in accordance with their respective accounts.

15

Now the revenue ruling which was passed upon by the

16

Internal Revenue Service on this whole question, held that the

\7

secondary premium payments were dnot deductible because of all

18

of these limitations and possibilities of refund and what not.

18

Then they ruled on the question of whether these credits of

20

income would be taxable as income and the revenue ruling holds

21

that no, that the income is not subject to taxpayers demands

22

and is so fettered with conditions that it is not relieved

23

either actually or constructively.

24
25

So the ruling is that the return is not taxable at
the time it's credited but it will be taxable, become taxable,

30

1

whan and if there are transfers made from the secondary reserve

2

to the primary reserve.

3

Now--

4

Q

Well, let's see. If you have $509«0.60 and

5

it earns

6

premium is $100,000, and they're suspended, because it's;paid

7

out

8

that's your investment. Then the sixth year the increment is

9

used to pay your premium, in that year do you get the increment

10

as a deduction and also have to return the increment as income?

$100,000 so that now it’s $600,000 and your annual

of the secondary account, after you've got the $500,000

11

Q

(immediately following)

It's awashout.

12

A

It's a washout.

13

Q

You know, this isn't complicated, is it?

14

A

It's really nothing, the Ninth. Circuit when

15

we finished our argument there asked us if next time we wouldn't

16

bring a complicated case.

17

Q

Yes.

18

A

I'll tell you, thecomplication

arising out

19

of what has just been mentioned here is tremendous. Actually,

20

the industry is facing thi3 exact situation right now where, in

21

1970, there were transfers made out

22

associations don't know what was transferred, whether they're

23

contributions,

24

lection is that the only instructions that they have so far

25

is that the F.S.L.I.C. is to treat it the way you want it,'

of the secondary, and the

whether the income, and therefore, ny recol-

31

1

But it is true that as far as the income is concerned,

z

it seems to me that it would be a wash transaction» The income

3

would become taxable,, and it would be deductible becuase ap­

4

plied on this obligation. But the whole business of crediting

5

this return, forgetting for a moment the possibility of refunds

6

on termination or liquidation, really is of no great moment.

7

The amount that's credited from the primary reserve

8

to the secondary reserve simply increases the secondary and de­

9

creases the primary, and yet any benefit to be derived by any

10

taxpayer depends upo^nwhen the combined primary and secondary

11

reserves reach 2%, so that the mere fact that one has increased

12

and the other decreased really is not that significant.

13
14
15

16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

One of the final arguments of the government and in
this respect reliance was placed primarily on an argument which
the tax court of the United States developed, and that is that
the legislative history of this statute prooves that the pay­
ment is not an insurance premium, it was intended as a capital
investment, in the F0S.L„I.C.
We have searched the legislative history and can find
nothing in support of this argument. The tax code even said that
the secondary reserve and the stock of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board were fungible, which to us indicated a failure to
grasp the completely different functions of the two agencies.
The Federal Horae Loan Bank Board is a credit organ­
ization and an association buys stock in that Board and thereby

32

I

becomes entitled to borrow funds. On the other hand, the FSLXC

2

is solely an insurance company and is concerned solely with

3

insuring the accounts of the savings depositors of the ESLIC.

4

The only reference between the two in Congress was

5

that in order to lighten the financial burden on taxpayers that

6

had to pay the additional 2% insurance premium, the amount re­

7

quired to be paid in for the bank acock was reduced from 2 to 1%

8

because as Congress said, there was general agreement that the

0 :bank was overcapitalized, whereas the insurance company greatly
10

11

needed to expand its insurance reserves.
There is no connection whatsoever in function or

12

purpose of the two payments and we think that the fundamental

13

fallacy of the tax court here was this point that this was in

14

the nature of capital because it was fungible with the bank

15

stock. You see, there's absolutely no basis for that.

16
17

If it please the Court, I think that that covers most
of our arguments, other than those that we have set forth in

18 jour briefs and this is a complicated thing. We certainly agree
19

with the government that the essence of these payments should

20

govern whether they are deductible or not. We think that the

21

government conceeds that they were necessary expenses, we think

22

the facts show that they are ordinary in that all those faced

23

in a similar situation paid them, and we do not believe that

24

there was any element of a capital expenditure or a capital

25

investment involved here. I think that the Ninth Circuit Court

33

1

of Appeals should be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. SINN, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. ZINN: Thank you , Mr. Chief Justice.

7

A few brief points. I think one of the difficulties

8

in addition to the mathematical difficulties in this case is

9

the fact

that Respondent was required to both pay the regular

to

annual premium in 1963 and also to come up with the additional

II

money that would go into the secondary reserve, and this aspect

12

of compulsion is one that goes through a lot of tax eases and

13

a statement from this Court regarding its significance would

14

be most welcome,,
I should like to put a hypothetical to the Court,

15

16

which raises--Q

position as to the 1/12 —

19

3

A

Just almost. The

4

in great detail why it could not beconsidered
Q

5
6

A

Well, no cash payments, but they still are

obligated to pay the regular premium,,
Q

9
10

And in the year when the secondary reserve

is resorted to for premium payments there are no payments in --

7

8

tax court has elaborated

Well, I know, but there are no payments

into the secondary reserve.

1!

A

That8s right. They're suspended.

12

Q

So that any payments into the secondary

13

reserve are never used to pay any kind of a current expense?
A

14
15

That’s correct. It's used to pay the future

premium.

16

Now this question of compulsion as wa said I think is

1-7

very important and I’d like to put a simple hypothetical to the

18

Court to demonstrate what our position is.

19

Let us suppose there have been a lot of fires in a

20

particular area and a local ordinance is passed requiring each

21

business in that locality to obtain each year from the local

22

fire department a certificate of fire safety. Let's suppose in

23

order to obtain that certificate of fire safety, guards have to

24

be postedon the business premises each night and also a modern,

25

up to date sprinkler system has to be installed on the premesis.
35

'1

1 would suggest that although the salaries of the

2

guards are ordinary and necessary business expenses, that this

3

Court would held unanimously that the cost of the sprinkler

4

system is a capital expenditure, this time within the meaning

5

of Section 263. Even though, if I may quote from the Respondents

S

brief, the purpose of making both expenditures is the same, the

7

compulsion of making both expenditures is the same, and the

8

consequence of not making both expenditures is the same.

©

Q

Your point is, I gather, your suggestion is

10

that whether or not these expenditures are compelled has nothing

11

to do with the issue—

12

A

Precisely, and the expression of this Court

13

on that issue I think would do a great deal to resolve a whole

14

lot of tax cases that are now pending.

15

Q

Does anyone seriously raise any question

16

that the cost of the sprinkler system would be araertized over it

17

its useful life? It

IS

A

It seems to us, Mr. Chief Justice, that

19

Respondents argument here, principle argument in its brief,

20

which they did not elaborate this afternoon is that it had to

2?

pay the Section 404

22

It had to pay them, that’s what the Ninth Circuit said, that's

23

why they held adversly to the government. And we say that the

24

fact that you had to pay them isn't any more significant in the

23

(d) payments under the National Housing Act.

resolution of this case than the fact that you're required to

36

1

put in the sprinkler system.

2

The question is, whether you have an asset within

3

the meaning of those regulations, with a useful life extending

4

substantially beyond the close of the taxable year. And that

3

question is the same whether it be a sprinkler system or the

6

contributions to the secondary reserve that are involved here.

7

Q

Since you put a hypothetical to us, let

8

me put one to you, if I can, Mr. Zinn„ Suppose that in this

9

insurance scheme you had a formula that fixed the amount to

10

be paid--—

11

A

12

Q

Each year?
Each year, and then, based on actual ex­

13

perience, each year there was a refund. Mow I realise that

14

mathematically it would be a little difficult to do that

15

each year, but soppose it could come. You would say, them,

16

that the dividend would reduce the total expenditure?

17

A

Right. The hypothetical you put is very

18

similar to a ruling relating to the Federal Deposit Insurance

19

Corporation which is cited in both briefs and which we think

20
