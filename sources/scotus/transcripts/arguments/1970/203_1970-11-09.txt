ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. SELVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, this case is on writ of. certiorari to the Supreme Court

of California to review a judgment of death imposed by a jury

n

upon the Petitioner after his conviction of murder in the

n

first degree.

is

The question that is raised and to which the grant­

14

ing of certiorari was limited is whether California's procedure

15

of imposing the death penalty by leaving the choice of penalty

16

to the jury in its absolute discretion,

17

trolled by any standard fixed by law is a denial of due pro­

18

cess.

19

unguided and

uncon­

That there are no standards governing the process in

20

this lav/ of California is a fact that has been noted many

21

times by the highest court of that State and the jury in this

case was told that in so many words,

23

absolute discretion was confided the choice^ of penalty for

24

which choice the law fixed no standards.

that to them and in their

If California, as many other states, had a

Not necessarily.

My submission then would be

the first answer I would make is that if

2

might well distinguish between the two.

3

of the judge's special training and experience and expertise*

4

there is his greater knowledge of the purposes and objectives

5

of the criminal law, a knowledge that goes beyond that which

6

an ordinary person could be supposed or deemed to have* and

7

there is the coordination of his own action* his own exercise

8

of discretion to what he determines from his experience and

9

from his knowledge of the lav/ are the objectives and the aims

10

and the legislature

There is the matter

of punishment.

11

That being so,

the likelihood that he would arrive

12

at a result intended or dictated by the law,

as distinguished

13

from personal preference or personal reaction of the situation,

14

is so much greater that a legislature could very well classify

15

between the two and insulate that classification in my sub­

16

mission from any contention under either equal protection or

17

due process.

18

Q

One last question, while I have you interrupted.

19

As I understand Mr. McGautha's co-defendant received a life

20

sentence from the jury, and I take it it is your position

2?

that this difference in the imposition of penalty is indicative

22

of caprice on the part of the jury?

23

A

Well, it is illustrative, it is not necessarily

24

so.

25

were factors in the evidence upon which a jury might

3

lar vice is they weren't told that the law makes whatever it

is they may have decided in that connection a distinguishable

6

the two men.

sharp conflict, and under a statute imposing standards of a

3■

^

The evidence on that score was in

sort, for instance, that we find in the model penal code, not­

u

withstanding that the jury exhypofchisae

15

McGautha pulled the trigger, there might have been because of

16

the sharp conflict enough doubt in their minds so that under

17

an appropriate instruction they could have treated that doubt

18

as a mitigating circumstance.

19

Constitution requires that that be treated as a mitigating

20

circumstance; what I am saying is that that is an indication

21

of the Kind of standards that could be framed* that could be

22

imposed* and that might lead to the very result understandably

23

and inferably* at which here California only guesses.

fact, it was in conflict within fcheprosecution15s own case,

21

the judge without standards.

How does that square with the idea that is

1

widely held, ividely expressed„ that the jury and the whole

process is to express t?oe community conscience, to distinguish

between the judge as an expert and the jurors as non-expert

science of the community is concerned,
Q

But when the judge fixes the sentence, is he

making a legal decision, in your view?

Is that a question of

law?
A

That when he considers the aims and objects of

12

punishment,, when he considers the material, the information

13

that in normal practice every judge gets by way of presentencinq

14

reports, probation reports and the like, I think that there is

15

a considered and designed effort to impose the particular

16

penalty in theeircumstances of this particular case, in the

17

judge's opinion as an expert of the law, is what the law had

18

in mind as a general policy.

19

Q

If you are right in the proposition that it is

20

a question of law, then how can the jury be deciding it at all,

2!

with or without guidance?

22

h

Well, simply, as a question of law, simply be­

23

cause the statute does nothing, nothing necessarily, imposes

24

upon a state a sharply defined division between the functions

25

of judge and jury in a case.

Common law for many years, wasn’t
9

1

it, until Fox’s act and others, the jury decided the law in

2

libel cases, among other things.

3

It is not unknown to the lav/ that questions of law may be sub­

4

mitted to the jury, but when they are, when they are I suggest

5

that, generally admitted under a charge that attempts at least

6

to put before the jury the considerations that the law con­

7

siders to be the determinants of decision, and that is what

8

the California procedure does not do.

That was submitted to them.

Now, if I may say just a word, if Your Honor please,

15

and cautions must be exercised

12
13

what is left of my time to reply to mention briefly what seems

14

to be the argument in opposition to the position we have taken

15

in this case.
So far as California is concerned, about what it

16

17

comes down to is that the penalty phase of a murder trial in

18

California is a pretty fair thing.

19

admitted, procedural niceties are observed, and review of

Q

Thank you, Mr. Selvin.

I have one more question.

If California

death penalty were mandatory, would that in your view be

Let me say first that it's not necessary to

1 am inclined to

arise under the due process clause.

9

10

mind and my own reflection on it is that there were 160-some

1!

odd crimes for which the death penalty was standard procedure

12

at the time that

13

So far as due process is concerned, 1 suppose it gets down

14

ultimately to the question whether there is such a compelling

15

interest on tbep&rfc of the government to make retribution a

16

factor in criminal law as to justify taking one’s life, because

17

I submit that only a compelling interest can justify the taking

18

of one’s life even for the commission of a heinous crime.

19

if retribution is not such a compelling interest, then rehabili­

2©

tation, protection of society and all the rest of the purposes

21

of the punishment that can be encompassed and can be furthered

22

by life imprisonment would then leave the answer to the question!

Wow, the question might

Under the cruel and un-

f

amendment to the Constitution was adopted.

But

let: me say at least in doubt.
But primarily, from the standpoint of far more or
less limited attack on the California procedure, there is nothing

1

that needs to be decided in that connection that in any way

2

indicates the death penalty per se.
Q

3

Well, if the death penalty were mandatory and

4

were not unconstitutional, then you are here because California

5

israore lenient that it might have to be*
A

6

Well, it is capriciously more lenient.

It does

not — you see, California hasn't expressed any preference for

8

one penalty rather than the other.

9

so time and time again, and in fact, a jury is told that in

Our supreme court has said

just about those words.

situation is that the penalty for murder has not been fixed

What your argument comes clown to, Mr. Selvin,

22

in a sense is that the legislature of California eou'Jd vest

Constitution in either case.

So far as the legislature is concerned, when it

penalty for that crime is one thing cr the other, it has im­

plicitly set the standard.

the confines of the Constitution to set the standard.

7

It has the legislative power within

So far as the judge is concerned — I have answered

8

thatquestion somewhat ramblingly -- I think it is a classifiable

9

different situation the legislature might do it, and that justi­

19

fication for doing itwould be found in the small likelihood

11

that the judge's knowledge and sense of obligation, and more

12

particularly, Ms knowledge of the objectives of the criminal

13

law would in effect see that the sentence, -would see to it that

14

the sentence was opposed in accordance with the law's purposes

15

and intentions in the matter.

16

That is, in substance, what the California courts

17

have said with respect to its indeterminate sentence law, ex­

16

cept that they find problem with the language of the statute,

19

some rather more: specific standards than that- , but it does come \

20

down to the same thing, that having set the generalised

21

standards, the objective ©f the statute, it is then permissible

22

for the legislature to impose on . one having the necessary

23

qualifications and expertise the job of seeing whether those

24

standards are met in a particular ease.

ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GEORGE, ESQ.,
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA

1

MR* GEORGE:

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

3

the Court, this case on direct review from the California

4

Supreme Court involves a single issue, whether petitioner was

5

deprived of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment

S

by the procedure under which the jury was entrusted with the

1

decision whetherhe should be punished alternatively with death

8

or life imprisonment, and the resolution of this issue will

9

affect the sentences of each of the over 550 prisoners in the

10

Nation under sentence of death.
The procedure which is involved in petitionerTs case

11

12

under California law provided that after the jury found the

13

petitioner guilty of first degree/inurder, additional evidence

14

and argument on the issue of puni.shir.enfc was received and the

15

jury returned a penalty verdict after being instructed as

16

follows:

«*

First of all, that the proper factors to consider

17
18

in guiding its discretion in fixing the punishment were so-and-

19

so —> lcll get into those in more detail

20

structed as to certain factors.

21

these factors included all the evidence of the circumstances

22

Does the record show how long the jury was out

on the sentencing?
A

The jury was out a bit longer than they were on

the guilt phase, and I believe it was the better part of a day,
but I'm not clear to theexact amount of time.

But something

in the neighborhood of that.
Fourthly, and this, in this respect the California
Supreme Court has gone way beyond what this court held in the
Williams case, no hearsay or incompetent evidence is permitted
on theissue of penalty.

The prosecution can't come in and say

Joe slov heard that the defendant did this, and all that.

Wo,

everything must be established by the same strict rules which
govern the admission of evidence on the issue of guilt.
Mow, the argument, that too is strictly curtailed.
The prosecution is precluded from mentioning such things as
the fact that the defendant might be out on parole in seven
years if he gets a life sentence.

He is not allowed to argue

all sorts of things about the fact that the death penalty is
considered by some to foe a deterrent.

He is not allowed to

argue that the trial court might reduce the punishment in its
complete discretion, nor that the state supreme court or the
governor might do that.
23

This is thought to dilute the jury's sense of re­

!
2

sponsibility, so none of that can be done.

There is a special

3

rule of prejudicial error.

4

requires reversal, even where the California Supreme Court,

5

would affirm, had that same error occurred at the guilt trial

6

of a defendant.

7

by the trial judge who has complete

8

exercises to reduce the death sentence to life imprisonment,

9

and he need not find any reason, he need not find any error

Any substantial error whatsoever

And finally we have very meaningful review
discretion which he often

10

of law, he need not do anything, he can re-weigh the evidence

11

de novo and for his own reasons, which need never be disclosed,

12

reduce that death sentence to life, and that is done.

13

Q

Is that done sui sponte or only on application?

14

A

It can be done either way, but I think it is a

15

fairly routine motion which is made.

10

always a two- or three-week gap between the return of the

17

verdict and the imposition of sentence, at which time routinely

18

a motion for a new ferial and/or reduction of punishment is

made.

Q

that is the end of it.
If is just we find that the evidence on the

guilt phase was not sufficient to show any, whatever it is,

be guilty of is second degree murder?

Yes.

That is correct.

That's right.

And aside of

21

re-weighing evidence of premeditation in the case of People

22

vs. Anderson, which we have cited, there the Supreme Court

23

said this was a murder of first degree by virtue of the felony

24

committed and we find that there is insufficient evidence to

25

indicate that the defendant was engaged in deviate sexual
26

1

conduct and therefore the first degree murder conviction can't

2

stand so we reduce it to second, so that is clone, too.

3

Finally, I would like to indicate in this respect

4

that —

5

Q

The defendant doesn't get another shot under

6

those circumstances for a new trial when the most he could foe

1

convicted of would foe second degree murder?

8

A

9

Q

Yes, when the Supreme Court said the evidence

iO

in this case, viewing it most strongly in favor of the prose­

11

cution, simply does not shew a case of first degree of murder.

12

We therefore reduce it, to the conviction of second degree

13

murder and affirm the conviction, is that what they do?
A

14

That is true.

As modified, it is affirmed,

15

but an important qualification is that there must affirmatively

16

appear in the record sufficient evidence to uphold it on that

17

second degree theory.

thing is reversed completely and sent back for a new trial.

19

So that is only done when,

20

clearly indicates malice of forethought, that there is some

21

doubt as to whether it rises to the level of premeditation.
Q

22

When there is any doubt as to that, the

let's say, the mental element

When you say for a new trial, do you mean on

This is reversal, yon mean?

6

Q

It goes bacK for a new trial on penalty only,

a new jurey is empaneled, than?

7

A

That's correct, and that usually means that

8

the prosecution has to present much of its, if not all of its

9

evidence on the question of guilt, because the jury has, of

10

course, to be informed of that as the main basis really for

11

its determination whether the defendant is fit to live.

12

Wow, the death penalty is a very selective thing in

13

California.

14

it is a small proportion of murders which become murders in

the first degree.

16

degree murders which receive the death penalty.

17

statistics I fchinK clearly wipe out any semblance of basis for

18

the argument that there is a racial overtone to the death

19

penalty as far as California is concerned.

20

statistics affirmatively show that, if anything, it is the

21

Caucasians who have received snore death sentences than racial

22

minorities in proportion to their convictions of first degree

murder.

As far as the jury being permitted to impose the

death penalty for arbitrary reasons, it is essential to note

9

that the jury is free to do this under any system, a system

of fixed standards, they can still do it.

They can be told

12

face, and they can still come back and do that and there is

13

no system divisible by man that can preclude that possibility.
In fact, the Royal Commission in Great Britain

found that jurists were exercising their discretion in manda­

California Supreme Court in the last five years* I could not

6

How are they going to

This is 1 think an impossible task

And, of course, despite petitioner's denials, it is

1

very obvious that his arguments implicate judge sentencing,

8

not only in capital cases but judge sentencing in other

9

criminal cases.

It implicates the granting and denial of pro­

10

bation, it implicates the fixing of indeterminate terms by

11

an administrative agency, and it implicates parole proceedings,

12

and possibly even clemency, although that may be an extra

13

legal function.

14

How, this is basically what the fixed standard pro­

15

posal means, that the jury needs a list defining all the

16

aggravating and mitigating factors and a formula for weighing

17

them, something like A plus B plus C minus X and Y.

18

would like to inquire, how does this aid the jury's function

19

in determining, as this Court said in Witherspoon, whether a

20

defendant is fit to live.

21

this is a matter of expressing the conscience of the community.

22

This, I

This is not a matter for expertise,

The proposals that petitioner has advanced would

23

turn the fact-finding process -- it would rather turn the fix­

24

ing of punishment into a fact-finding process, and this is

25

totally foreign to the concept of punishment fixing, even with
31

And 1

?

special verdicts this couldn't properly be evaluated.

2

think this is important, that to be effective fixed standards

3

would have to impel a death verdict in some factual context.

They would have to say, if you find these aggravating circum­

5

stances, then return a verdict of death.

a loophole.

7

if there are no mitigating circumstances, you can sfci33 return

8

a verdict of life.

9

it shows that what these proposals for fixed standards really

However, they leave

They say despite aggravating circumstances, even

Mow this is probably just and proper, but

10

amount to in the last instance is a contention that there is

11

a constitutionally impelled preference for life, and this by

12

the backdoor, and this is a different thing from saying that

S3

there is a permissible legislative preference for life.

14

Where does the Constitution express a preference

15

for life?

16

On the contrary, the Constitution, in the Fifth Amendment,

17

speaks of capital offenses and recognise them.

18

don't have this loophole, which the proponents of fixed

19

standards have made, then you have unavoidable and desirable

20

jury discretion and —

2!

It doesn't, and yet this would be the end result.

Q

And if you

Is there in the brief of the other side a short

22

compact statement of what standards they say are constitution-

23

ally required?

24

25

A

Ho, there is not a specific one, but I would

like to read to you what petitioner advances as his suggestion
32

1

for standards and inquire whether this would meet constitu­

2

tional requirements, objections of vagueness, and I quote from

3

petitioner’s brief,, and that is stated on page 27 of his

4

brief, footnote 19:

S

"Consideration of the choice of penalty could be

6

centered around these objectives"

7

"with a view of choosing that one which, having regard to the

8

circumstances of the case and the character and temperament

9

of the defendant, would most nearly further rather than frus­

10
1!

that is, of penalty —

trate them."
Sow, I inquire if this is any tend of standard?

12

don’t know what a jury would do in trying to follow this or

13

of an appellate court trying to review this.

14

Q

15

that has been proposed?

16

ft

17
18

I

Is that the nearest to a set of standards

That is the nearest except cross-reference to

the model penal code set of factors, which I have discussed.
How, in the very short time remaining, I would like

IS

to note this, as Mr. Justice BlacKmun stated;

20

could abolish the degrees of murder and fix the penalty of

21

death where there was a certain standard of aggravation con­

22

sisting of premeditation or felony murder in the absence of

23

mitigating circumstances which they could define, as the
•'

•

California

■} f*

24

statute does, the defendant being under ]8 years of age, or

25

else there could he a-first degree mandatory death sentence,
33

1

as Delaware has, with the judge's power to reduce it to life,

2

a discretionary power when the jury recommends that.
But the logical end result of petitioner’s argu­

3
4

ment is this, either no death penalty or a mandatory death

5

penalty, and we submit that either one is undesirable.
And in conclusion I would like to state this:

6

First

1

of all, petitioner is in no position to raise these contentions

8

which are not really applicable to his situation or himself,

9

these vague claims of arbitrariness, racial bias, and all

10

the rest.

11

basis for this,and as this Court said in Harris, we shouldn't

12

permit the possibility that abuses occur to give sinister

13

coloration to procedures that are basically reasonable.

14

The record affirmatively discloses a constitutional

Now, finally, we submit that jury discretion is an

15

unavoidable feature of capital punishment, as the Royal

16

Commission indicated, even where there is a mandatory death

17

sentence.

IS

the standpoint of fairness as it enables the jury to best

19

carry out its functions of expressing the conscience of the

20

community, as Witherspoon sets out.

21

sirable, it is to the defendant's advantage, as we have in­

22

dicated, it would result in more death verdicts to have fixed

23

standards.

Aside from being unavoidable, it is desirable from

And not only is it de­

And if some o£ petitioner’s argument is ready to
admit that theoretical and unrealistic campaign for fixed
34

1

standards,, artificial and arbitarily fixed standards, is only

2

a device to abolish the death penalty, at least with respect

3

That question, too, is involved in the Crampton
case, and my argument here will be applicable to that case too.

whether the Constitution requires a split or bifurcated trial

separating the question of guilt from the question of penalty,

In either aspect, the questions are, of course,

appropriate for decision fey this Court as the ultimate arbiter

24

With respect to standards, there are certain things

25

that are clear.

.In the first place,

38
i

there is nothing specific

1

in the Constitution relating to this matter.

2

the general provision of the Fifth Amendment, adopted in 1790,

3

that Congress shall not deprive any person of life, liberty

4

or property without due process of law, a provision made ap­

5

plicable to the states by the 14th Amendment in 1868.

6

We have only

Perhaps it may be said that the concept of due pro­

7

cess of lav; does not provide standards for the guidance of

8

the courts on this question and is none the worse for that.

9

However* it is clearly a very general concept and it would be

10

at least surprising if it was found to have a meaning today

11

which no one had ever conceived it had during the first 175

12

years or so of its existence.

13

Of course* I am familiar with Holmes' statement

14

that it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of

15

law than so it was in the time of Henry II, but it is also

16

equally true,. I think, that it is at least surprising to find

17

things in'the Constitution today which no one dreamed were

18

there as recently as five years ago, and with which we lived

19

for 175 years without even raising the question.

20

Theoretically I suppose a requirement that there

21

must be legislative standards for jury sentencing in murder

22

cases would toe equally applicable to jury sentencing in

23

capital cases, and a fourth of our states have extensive jury

It is clear, though, that jury sentencing in noncapital eases predated the Constitution,,

There was no jury

As a matter of fact, the problem we have here ha,s

tory there were efforts to mitigate the harshness of the

15

unvarying death penalty for serious crime.

IS

that Pennsylvania adopted the device of dividing murder into

17

two degrees, one with the death penalty and the other covering

18

murders where the extreme penalty was thought unwarranted.-

19

Over the years this solution was adopted in nearly every state,

20

but it was soon found that the degree system, though helpful,

21

was too rigid and mechanical and that indeed is a part of the

22

problem with so-called standards.

How, having spent perhaps too much time on what

©

my personal ideas are about what the jury should be told in

7

respect to standards, I would like to read very briefly what

8

McGautha's jury was told and what every California jury in

9

this kind of a case is told, particularly because it disposes,

10

1 submit, of California's argument that the penalty phase of

11

the trial is so fair and so scrupulously guarded that any­

12

thing that the defendant wants to put before the jury can go

13

in and the jury will know what it is they can d© with that

14

evidence»

15

And this is what the jury is told — I am not

16

going to read the whole -- all of the instruction, but the

17

parts that go really to the question of standards.

18

the law of this state — page 222 of the Appendix, Your Honor

19

— it is the law of this state that every person guilty of

20

murder in the first degree shall suffer death or Confinement

21

in the state prison for life at the discretion of '^ha jury.

22

And it says if you choose one or the other, you musfc say so,

22

and then it goes on — notwithstanding facts, if any, proved

24

in mitigation or aggravation, in determining 'which punishment

25

shall be inflicted, you are entirely free to act according to
53

It is

1

your own judgment, conscience and absolute discretion.

2

verdict must express the

3

They don't even have to agree on the reason why they are

4

going to give death or life, as the case rosy be.

That

individual opinion of each juror.

5

Q

Do you think it should fee required?

6

A

E3gc but it is an indication of the extent to

7

which the procedure is completel uncontrolled and not confined

8

by law, by standards, by criteria as to what the law says are

9

the determinants that go into making a decision, a judicial

10

decision.

11

reasons,

12

Sfo, I don't say that they ought to agree on all the

Q

The jury might disagree on the reasons for

13

finding a verdict of not guilty or a lessor charge, isn't that

14

true?
h

15

They could, yes, except that if they disagreed

16

on whether there was or wasn't premeditation,, for instance,

17

having regarded the definition of murder in California, that

18

might not fee --there might not foe a valid verdict.

IS

they all have to agree that there was premeditation, and they

2©

all have to agree that there was malice and they all have to

21

agree that it was the defendant who did it.

22

There

Then the charge goes on -- and this is the1 important

23

thing

24

thing that goes in, this is what they are told about the extent

2S

to which they can deal with the situation on their own.

because, despite all of this evidence, despite every­

54

Blow,

1

beyond prescribing the two alternative penalties,

2

self provides no standard for the guidance of the jury in

3

selection of the penalty but» rather,, commits the whole matter

4

of determining which of the two penalties shall be fixed to

S

the judgment^ conscience and absolute discretion of the jury.

the law it­

In the determination of that matter, if the jury

does agree^it must be unanimous.

told, despite everything that may have been put before them,

9

it Is a matter entirely of their judgment, conscience, and

10

Now, that is what they are

absolute discretion.

If

Q

But they are affirmatively told, are they not,

12

that they make this decision on all the evidence that they

13

have heard?

14

15
16
17
18

A
yes,

They are told to consider all of the evidence,

Your Honor.
Q

And the defendant, would you say that the de­

fendant has any real limit on what he can put before the jury?
A

Well, there are some,

they are not as broad

19

~~ I mean they are not as narrow as perhaps might be the case.

20

I think the general rule in California is that anything may be

21

put before the jury if it would be put before the judge if

22

he were talcing evidence for the purpose of determining what

23

the sentence should be.

M

limits, and one of the most Important limits,

25

Is the limit imposed by the Morse rule.

That Is very broad, but there are

55

for instance,

I should think that

1

a very relevant circumstance in determining whether one should

2

have life or death is to consider the possibilities that a

3

life team might not be a life team, that the man even though

4

not rehabilitated might be out on the streets sometime within

5

a comparatively short period of years, and yet that is one of

6

the important things that they can't be told, that can't be

7

evidence about it, and it can't be argued.

Q

You don't suggest that that would be helpful

to a defendant in this situation, do you?

10

A

Well —

II

Q

To be told that ha might — to have the jury

12
13

told that he might be out on the street very soon?
A

Well, no, but, on the other hand, if they

14

could be told what the parole system is like and how difficult

15

it is to get out on the street, under an adult authority per­

16

forming his function, that might be helpful, if the jury were

17

worried, as California suggests was the case here, if the

m

jury were worried about turning a murderer loose on the

19

streets, they might very well want to know how effective or

20

ineffective, as the ease may be, the parole system was.

Now, it could be helpful to the defendant, it could

be harmful to him»

of any set of standards beyond the fact that we should set

some kind of a basis, some kind of a proposition or rule that

would govern the deliberations.

Q

Well, Mr. Selvin, am I correct, Mr. George

said the state cannot show that, that this man can get out on

That is how the problem arose.

18

Q

In this case they couldn’t do it?

19

A

Ho-

The jury inquired about the possibility

20

of parole and the judge then gave them the so-called Morse

21

instruction, which was prepared by the Supreme Court in the

22

Morse opinion, to be given in that situation.

to have standards, leaving it fco the legislature to determine

5

what those standards should he.

Q

I am only worried about this one standard you

7

suggest, which I don't understand how it would benefit the

petitioner.

A

It may not benefit the petitioner.

5

comes from the defense, our Supreme Court has consistently

ruled that it is proper, that it was not error to refuse

7

those instructions because, as they said in the Howie case,

8

the instruction that I read to you was given and that is

9

enough, and that is all that they are entitled to.

10

Q

Well, except that it really beings on the

11

bottom of page 221 and covers all of 222 and most of page

12

223, and does reflect, does ifc not, particularly on the top

13

of page 222, the cases decided by your Supreme Court, which

14

on the state submission at least do constitute standards.

15

In this part of the trial the law does not forbid you from

16

being influence by pity for the defendants, and you may be

17

governed' by mere sentiment and sympathy for the defendants

18

in arriving at a proper penalty in this case.

19

law does forbid you from being governed by mere conjecture,

prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling, and so on, and

each one of those expressions in the court's instructions
