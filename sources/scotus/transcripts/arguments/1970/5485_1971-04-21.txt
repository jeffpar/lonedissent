On

January 27, 1969 Petitioner was summarily convicted by a
Grenada County, Mississippi Circuit Court Judge, Marshall
Perry for a remark he allegedly made in Judge Perry’s courtroom —
Judge Perry sentenced Petitioner to four months in

i<

?

jail, although the maximum sentence is one month, to which the

2

Supreme Court of Mississippi later reduced the sentence.

conviction resulted from the incidents which occurred on

Sheriff, who ordered him to walk around to the rear.

thereupon said in a loud and offensive voices "What the hell

That is th'e sum total of any allegation of contu­
macious behavior on Petitioner3s part.

What would be your view if the Judge had

imposed a sentence of 30 days for contempt of court?
A

16
17

At:’this

point, according to the State8s show-cause petition, Johnson

11

12

Yes, Yeur Honor.

Your Honor, first of all, I think that that

would be a far different matter than what he did do.

And I

think ©van then the behavior of Petitioner Johnson that was
alleged is far lass than the outrageous behavior which is
present in many of the decided cases in this court on this
subject.
Furthermore, I think there is another issue which
ought t© be raised and faced and determined, and that is the
question of whether the Judge ought to invoke a summary con­
tempt power against a person who is not then involved in a

4

1

proceeding before the court* or whether or not the ordinary

2

fuller hearing ought to be required,

3

Q

What difference does it make whether it8s a

spectator,? a tourist? a defendant or a m©asb@jr of the bar of the

court?

Q

Except that it sight be a higher degree of

culpability on the part of the lawyer,

9

A

Leaving aside the question of a lawyer for

to

a moment? I think the difference is this % that in the case of

11

a defendant before the court it is possible — it is much more

12

difficult t© invoke summary punishment? because it involves the

13

possibility ©f prejudicing the case? possibly prejudicing the

14

jury and possibly interrupting the proceedings.

15

The view of the court’s

Bo you question the court’s power t© deal with that

A

I don’t question that — the power of the

16

court to deal with an utterance of that kind in the courtroom*

17

although I think traditionally it would have to have been the

18

kind of behavior which would have disrupted the proceedings.

19

The State’s show-cause petition alleges that the sheriff and

20

his deputy brought Petitioner before the judge and related to

21

the judge what had happened, indicating that -the judge had

22

never heard the disruption which had taken place.

23

And again-, 2 think that although idle court has the

24

power to dispose of a disruption in the court, the question of

25

whether ©r not it should deal with it in a summary proceeding

10

A

Well, there are several things he could to,

1!

12

15

and it depends, I think ■—*
Q

He could put him in jail for 30 days right

I think h® could probably put him in jail

indirect contempts.

If the sheriff heard it and told the judge

that, that's different?

Even though it's in the courtroom?

I think that is correct?

a hearing? that is correct.

1

The judge ordered the show cause, ordering that the

2
3

show cause petition be filed and within two days of the order,

4

petitioner filed a motion that Judge Perry disqualify himself

5

in the pending shox-tf cause hearing, alleging personal prejudice

s

and further alleging that since the judge had ordered his

7

arrest he could not fairly decide the action.
On February 1, 1967, approximately a week after the

8

event, Petitioner filed a petition for removal to the United

9
10

States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.

11

It was not until some 21 and a half months had elapsed that

12

the United States District Court remanded the prosecution to

13

the Grenada County Circuit Court, holding that Petitioner's

14

remedy in the Federal system could rely only after he demon­
strated he had been deprived of his constitutional rights by

15

the state courts.

16

On January 22, 1969, prior to any action in Grenada

17

County on the contempt charge and two months after the Federal

18

Court had returned the prosecution to the state system,

19

Petitioner and others filed an action in 'the United States

20

District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, a

21

whole separate action to restrain trials of Negroes and women

22

until such time as those persons were not systematically ex­

23
24

cluded frcfci juries in violation of the U. S. Constitution.

'

25

Judge Perry was named as one of the defendants in that
9

1

action and served with process on January 23, 1969.

2

January 24, 1969 a summons was issued directing Johnson to

3

appear in Judge Perry's courtroom on January 27th to show cause

4

why he should not be punished on the old contempt charge.

5

On

On January 27th Petitioner and his attorney did appear

6

in front of Judge Perry for the show cause hearing, at which

7

time th© Judge cancelled the hearing, instead giving a contempt

8

conviction sentencing Petitioner- to four months in jail.

9

was set at $2,000 and subsequently reduced to the statutory

10

Bail

maximum of $300 by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.

11

Later that same morning in a second appearance before

12

Judge Perry in an effort to obtain the Judge's signature on a

13

bill of exceptions, the Judge refused and when Petitioner9s

14

attorney prepared a bill of exceptions the Judge summarily

15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

adjudged her in contempt, a conviction which was later reversed
by the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi.
Q

Why was it that the Judge, when this episode

happened., didn't punish him summarily?
A

l9m sorry, Your Honor; you mean why he. didn't

punish him in 1967?
Q

Yes.

Immediately when the episode happened.

A

The record does not show why he didn't.

The

record only shows that he just elected to travel the show
cause route rather to invoke such summary powers as he might
have had under the Mississippi statutes.
10

When was the order to show cause return-

1

2

able?
The order to show causa was returnable on

3
4

February 1st, I think, nine days affcesr the alleged contumacious

5

behavior„
Well, then I take it it was issued almost

6
7

immediately?
A

8
9

10

Yes, Your HoEior? it was issued almost

immediately, following the judge's order that a, show cause ©rdejr
be issued»

11

Q

Then why wasn't it heard then?.

12

A

Why was it not heard immediately?
The judge ordered that the show cause

13
14

15

petition be issued in 48 hours and why he didn't set it down
for an earlier hearing is not in the record. Your Honor»

that motion was never heard and never determined by the judge»

And was that ~ there was then a suit

filed against him?
A

There was then a suit filed against Judge

Perry»

That was after 21 and a half months had elapsed and

8

after -the Federal system had returned the case to -the Grenada

9

County Circuit Court»

About two months after -the case had

20

been returned * and still without any action taken on it in

It

The only thing that is in the record

which we have in the footnote in cur brief is that there was
never any prosecution on the matter.

The proseuction on the

substantive charge against Petitioner was dropped.

it was a trespass arising out of a civil rights demonstration.

A

In a restaurant or something like that;

I have no idea, Your Honor; it9s not in

the record.
From its earliest decisions this Court has

5
6

recognised the use of summary procedures, to convict must be

7

carefully controlled since they do not encompass the ordinary

8

procedural safeguards incorporated in our system of justices

9

the right of the accused to be apprised fully ©f the nature of

10

the charges against him; the right to put on a .defense; the

11

right to counsel.

12

Generally the narrow area within which summary

13

contempt proceedings have been permitted is where the trial

14

judge has observed the contumacious conduct and then acts

15

swiftly by conviction of the contemner rather than by an al­

16

ternative remedy in order to quell the disturbance threatening

17

to upset the sanctity of the courtroom.

18

been held constitutionally permissible in dealing with an

19

obstreperous defendant.
‘This Court recently, in Illinois versus Allen

21

Other remedies have

mentioned at least two others? restraint and removal from the

courtroom.

24

a civil contempt, a postponement of the proceedings in a

Other summary procedures suggest themselves, con­

■proper case or by the judge informing the defendant that the

14

charges would be preferred against him for contempt at the con»

3

In light of these other possible remedies and

4

in light of this Court3® recent holding in Mayberry versus

5

Pennsylvania, which restricted the use of a summary conviction

6

after a trial's conclusion, since at that time immediate

7

res toratiOnof order is made or vindication of the authority

8

of the court.

Petitioner's conviction and its affirmance by the

9
10

Supreme Court of Mississippi must be reversed.
Q

11

there might have been some question about his fairness?

I think, Your Honor, that is ~

Q

Does he rely on this case to suggest that

the judge trying this contempt later might have had a personal
aniraus and would be biased?
A

19
20

Wasn't there a major part of Mayberry,

though, that the judge who was going to later hear the case,

15

17

It is no longer the primary requisite.

Your Honor.

Several possibles suggest themselves,

There are several affidavits in the record sugges­

ting Judge's personal bias against the defendant —■
Q

.Based on what, though?

Based on what?

I mean, just generalised allegations wouldn't suffice, though.

Yes, and also allegations of prejudice or

A

The first attorney who represented him on j

contempt, for protesting in Judge Perry8s court that -idle show

posture of Johnson may disqualify a judge by bringing a

12

suit against him?

13

A

law­

Mo, Your Honor? I don't suggest that and

14

I don't think that there is any suggestion here that this law­

15

suit was brought to divest the judge of his power to hear a

16

contempt charge.

17

Q

In your earlier arguments you suggested

18

thatthis was on® of the large factors, I -think is the way you

19

put it, in probable bias, since he was a defendant in a lawsuit,

20

the judge was a defendant in a lawsuit.

21

A

Yes, Your Honor? I think it is a major

22

factor, but I think that if, in a lapse of two years' time you

23

have your ^ ’titloner, who is a civil rights worker who was

24

working actively in that field

25

he brings a lawsuit —

What difference does it make whether he

18

1

was a civil rights worker or a plumber If he is guilty of

2

contumacious conduct in the courtroom?
A

.3

Well, 1 think if you have an. intervening

4

legitimate lawsuit with merits which was not brought simply to

5

divest on some charge in order to divest the judge ©f his

8

jurisdiction to hear the contempt charge I think you have an

7

intervening factor which simply requires the judge to excuse

S

himself.

9

Q

Has that lawsuit been tried?

A

That lawsuit, for the record, was won by

11

Petitioner.

The Federal Diarist Court issued an order enjoin

As a matter of fact, that order, Your Honor, was

issued and Judge Perry and others were enjoined prior to the
time that the judge cancelled the show cause hearing.
In other words the suit was filed within a matter

of 48 to 72 hours the United States Edstrlet Court issued its-'

Appendix C to your brief?

18

A

This is the same Judge Perry?

Same judge.

And, according to my reason

10

for making an appendix to the brief

— was that the — hadn8t

20

been published at the time this brief went to the printer.

21

Without all of the clouds of bias and prejudice

22

that may have existed, assuming for argument, on the part of

Judge Perry, towards this so-called s>civil rights worker,” or

whoever he might fee, I don*t see* that he is in any position to

But you

will find in the record that Judge Perry himself stated 'that he

12

I think that’s where the prosecuting attorney

It could hcive been both.

But# I might add

this: even though punishment was not summarily imposed#w hieh
he had a right to do for a violation of contempt in his

He could get

And I think this thing — Mr. Justice Harlan# I
forgot the words ha used to describe the last show cause order
or hearing# every opportunity was given this man and his counsel
to provide soma sort of response to show something in litigate#
something to purge himself.

Nothing was ever done.

Now# it's

true that9s a long time to wait to impose a penalty for

Q
said?

There never was a denial of what was

Never, up until this: moment.
A

5

No, sir.

And to me it gets back — X

6

don81 know whether our statute on appeals for contempt in

7

Mississippi is unique ©r not.

I didn't have time to research
\

8

some other states? it would have been atremendous task, but

9

I agree thoroughly

with ’the rational® of Mayberry and other

10

similar cases that if summary punishment is not immediately

11

imposed that that judge ought to get some other judge to hear

12

the thing.

13

there was a contempt and: what the penalty ought to be.

14

Hear the evidence and determine whether or not

Some judge unstung by the contemner's conduct,

15

unbiased, unprejudiced and unattached

16

I felt I was sort of like on thin ice in this case for a while

17

and after i tried to get counsel to agree in spite of the fact

IS

that I think in Rule 37 you file a submission without argument,

19

X tried to get them to agree to submit it.

20

— but I suggest this:

But, in studying the thing X studied on appeals

21

from contempt convictions and X found a right interesting tiling

22

which X point out in ray original brief, that that statute

23

accomplishes, I think, a greater degree, by a greater degree

24

what would be accomplished by having one single judge hear this

25

thing at a later date when summary punishment was not imposed.

25

1

That, statute , on appeal from a contempt convic­

2

tion provides that the Supreme Court of Mississippi, nine

3

judges, will review the thing on the record and decide (1)s

4

was there contempt?

5

contempt from -that cold printed record, uninfluenced by a

6

courtroom atmosphere and what not, they can do on© of four

7

things»

Then if they determine that there was a

They determina, the statuta says, whether the
appellant was guilty of contempt, and the sentence or decree

10

©r order of the court below may be affirmed, reversed, annulled

11

©r modified, according to the judgment of the Appellate Court»

12

That, of course, was the reason I attached that Boston opinion

13

as an appendix to the brief to show just how the Stats Supreme

14

Court has handled these things»

15

Now, there was a case where the same Judge Perry

IS

found a man named Boston, who is a lawyer in Winston County,

17

Mississippi, that ran against Judge Perry'for Circuit Judge,

18

in contempt and he appealed to our Supreme Court and they com­

19

pletely annulled the conviction»

©r modifyi they completely annulled it, as* you can see from

that appendiss»

22

Q

They didnet reverse, remand

X have some problems with your argument

23

and perhaps you can straighten it out,

Mr. Lyell, about your

24

argument about the Mississippi statute that gives the Supreme

25

Court reviewing power»

In this particular case in its ©pinion
26

1

the Supreme Court of your State saids "Upon appeal to this

2

Court from a conviction of direct complaint the statement of

the substantive facts set out in the judgment of 'the trial

5

far away from any sort of factual review that 1 had understood

you to suggest.

Stewart* is this? that they have to accept m a fact* from the
finding ©£ the trial court what this contemner did.

As Justice

Marshall asked* there has nevejp been any denial of the fact
that he did what he did.

Then* under this appeal statute they

would determine if that is a contempt* and go ahead and vacate*

Q

Well* there has never been a denial.

was there ever any opportunity for a denial?

He»

As I read the

statement of facts in the Petitioner's brief it boils down to
the fact that at 9s00 o'clock ia the mo«??aing on January 27*
1969 Johnson* with his lawyer* appeared before Judge Perry* and
denying Johnson's reguest for a hearing* Judge Perry read the

Under your statute if -there are two lawyers

exceptions in the event that the judge does not or will not,
and then they sign it and that5s the bill of exceptions.
Q

What happened here apparently is — the

paragraph under conclusion it says that Judge Perry refused to
sign it and therefore the alternative of having two lawyers who
were present sign it, was —
A

Well, it still would ~ 1 would still

defend the proposition, if the Court please, that since this
was a direct contempt in the presence of the Court, which X

35

i

must accept fche fact, because there has never been any denial

2

of it, or attempt to deny it and in any document which was

3

filed or in any argument that has been made, I think in that

4

respect the Supreme Court ©f Mississippi could accept the

5

trial judge9s statement as to what transpired.

.

To ms it simply gets back to this s how could this

6
7

man complain, when Judge Perry could have summarily put this

8

30 days on him right then and there, but he gets it two years

9

later and it9s fully reviewed by the Supreme C©u3:t.

10

How could

he complain?
Q

11

Well, 1 suppose he could complain that

12

he never had © chance to deny it and lie says he never said it.

13

He never had a chance to say that.

14

the judge, in fact heard it and then he didn't say it.
A

15

The whole premise is that

My premise is this,Mr. JusticeBrennan,

16

that whether or not he heard it, and he said he heard it, but

17

if he heard it it was direct? if he did not hear it it was

18

constructive.

direct, there was no contempt unless h@ said it.

I can only get bask to thiss they have

never even intimated that this contempt, did not transpire.
Q

4

Counsel, in the appendix or anywhere else,

5

do we have any record, any account of what took place when

S

Johnson failed to appear in response to the first order to show

7

cause as you say he failed to appear?

8

A

In fast 1 think you --

9

Q

Would the failure to appear in response to

10

an order t© show cause at a fixed time and place be, in itself»

11

a contempt under Mississippi law?

Would it be what, sir?

Would that, in itself, be a contempt,

That, ©s 1 understood it —

That’s what happened.

And that could

hardly be contemptuous?
A

Ho, sir.

Q

Mo? there was a petition for removal of

the ease to the United States District Court and the Court held
37

1

that petition for & matter of several months, as I understand

2

it, and then remanded it to the State Judge.

3

followed the second order to show cause? wasn^t that it?

4

then they came into court in response to that and, according

5

to what this record shows -they asked for a hearing and they were

6

denied a hearing.

And then there
And

Aren't those the facts?

If not, what are they?

Well, it is true that the Court said that

they could not consider disqualification of a trial judge when
it's done in his presence.
Court said.

That's what the Mississippi Supreme

Whereas, if it had been tried before another judge

you could have ~ Petitioner could have sought to disqualify.
A

Well, that's what they said.

Q

Well, isn't that an additional reason

:

he should have gone to another judge?
A

Well, as I say, Mr. Justice Marshall, we

all have our different ways of doing things —

38

and this Judge could have- said, “Mr. Sheriff, take this man

outside and give him 30 days — take him up to the jail»”

3

Eitiier way it gave him a show cause hearing, or an opportunity,

but he didn't —
