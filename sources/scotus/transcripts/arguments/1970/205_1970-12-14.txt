MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs We’ll hear arguments next in

No. 205, Bruno against the state of Pennsylvania. Mr. Quinlan?

s

ARGUMENT OF MR. DANIEL L. QUINLAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4

m-.f '

MR. QUINLANs Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

S
$

please. John Harry Bruno was iaorn and raised in the bourough of

7

Norristown which is about 20 miles west of Philadelphia® Now the

8

records in this case show that he attended public school, it

9

was elicited through the various hearings, habeas coupus hear-,

10

ings, supression hearings, sanity hearings that he had c?ever

11

been in trouble.
Low and behold he was drafted by the United States Army,

1E
13

in November of 1961, and at some point during his basic trainings

14

abbreviated though it was, it was determined that John was un­

15

like the other draftees. That he was sick and he was trans­

16

ferred to Fitzsimmons General Hospital in Denver, Colorado,

17

where he was in a psychiatric ward.
He was discharged by the United States Army in May of 1961

18
19

and sent home by himself.
Now prior to that, a murder had taken place in October

20
SI

of 1961, in Norristwon, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Husband

22

and wife were killed. Subsequent to Johns discharge from the

23

army, he held jobs in Norristown, and was not in any trouble tha:

24

anybody knows of, although fee reocod does show that subsequent

25

to December of 1963, when two other people were murdered, John
1

4

1

was interrogated by the County detectives and/or the District

2

Attorney8s Office, and now its 1964, and given a lie detector

3

test.

4
5

Q.

Mr. Quinlan, how is this background relevant to the

question of whether he can be held in custody pending trial-—-

S

A.

Well, Mr. Chief Justice—

7

0.

—while he is under a finding that he is incompetent

8

to be tried. That’s the real issue in the case, isn’t it?

9

A.

Yes, sir. From the very beginning, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

I entered my appearance within a week or ten days the . District

n

Attorney petetioned for a sanity commission, alleging that John

12

was insane.

13

And not competent to stand trial—

14

0.

Against his background wasn’t that almost imperative?

15

A.

No, sir. All they had to base their petition on was

16

the confession that they elicited from John Bruno when they

17

held him for 26 hours—

18

0.

Didn51 they—

19

A

--without a lawyer.

£0

0.

Didn’t they know his medical history?

21

A.

No sir, they did not. They subpoened his medical—

£2

0.

Does the record show that they didn’t know it?

23

A.

At that point they didn’t know it.

£4

0.

£5

A.

2

Does the record show it?
I believe it does, Mr. Chief Justice, yes. The records

1

of his medical records were not brought into the picture -until

2

the sanity commission actually sat in 1967. And they subpoened

3

them. The record will also show that one judge practically signed

4

all the orders in thic case.

S

Now I resisted the appointment of Idle sanity commission,

6

at the same time 1 filed a petition for a habeas corpus hearing

7

to find out what they did have against John Bruno. As Mr. Jus™

a

tics Roberts said, at the first appeal in the State Supreme

9

Court, how in the world can they take an illegal confession and

10

hold it here and say if John Bruno did these terrible things,

11

for the reasons that he gave for doing them, then he must be

12

crazy.
Now if the confession is inadmissable ira a courtroom, it

13
14

should not have been used for them to determine that they should

15

proceed for a samity commission.

Q.

16

In order to maintain that position you would in fact

17

be saying that a paychiartist confronted with the statement that

18

he did, or may have committed these crimes and that this was his

19

explanation, that the paychiartist walld not say that this man

20

should not be subject to further psychiatric examination?

21

A.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that'fc just what they did.

22

Q.

Shouldn't they have done so?

23

A.

Not in my opinion. This man was arrested, indicted, and

24

held on open charges for having killed five people. I think that

25

the plea of insanity is up to him, we never entered a plea of
3
6

■I
2

insanity in this case, and all the psychiatrist, had at the hearjing was John"s confession and the army medical records, tod the

3

army medical records were November and December of I960, and

4

January., February, April, and March of 1961, The sanity commis­

5

sion hearings were not held iintil 1967, and 1 was there and

6

the record will show that the sanity commission hearing consisted

7

of all the police, the county police, detectives, state police,

8

two police departments, municipalities, saying we were in there,

9

there was a total of 12 - 15 policemen interrogating John, and

10

he admitted doing these things and he gave as his reason for

n

doing it that his father told him that there people had put

12

the evil eye on him,

13

Q,'

Mr, Quinlan, standing alone, wouldn't that alert any

14

doctor, even if he were not a psychiatrist, to at least a strong

15

suspicion that there was something mentally wrong with this man?

16

A

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, except the test for the man’s

17

competency to stand trial in Pennsylvania is whether or not he

13

-understands the nature of the proceedings against him, and

19

does he have the ability to confer with counsel,

20
21
r. a

23

Q.

that further inquiry?about his capacity to cooperate in his own
defense? If it doesn’t then the laws of all the other 49 states
are wrong, Mr, Quinlan,

24
25

Doesn’t that put them on notice that they should make

A

Well, I don't think that it can be used to commit him

to an institution for -the criminal insane,

4
7

1

Q.

Mr. Quinlan, how

long have you had this sanity com­

£

mission procedure in Pennsylvania? Is this a long established

3

routine in criminal cases?

4

A,

The act, I believe, is 1951. The act, since then, has

5

been repealed. I initially contended that the District Attorney

6

was not a person under that act entitled to initiate the proce­

7

edings. The trial court overruled me, the State Supreme Court

0

said the issue was interlocutory, ans on appeal, if Your Honors

9

please, this case was argued in -the Pennsylvania State Srpreme

10

ii

Court in January of 1968.
Before an opinion came down, Justice Musminel died. The

!2

Chief Justice, Chief Justice Bell ordered it back on the argu­

13

ment list, and Justrice Primary, who had been appointed in Jus­

14

tice Musminels place sat with the court—

15

Q.

Let me follow through on my inquiry. You say you've

16

had it since 1951. To what extent--- well, let me ask this. Do

17

you have a procedure for civil commitment--.^-

18

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q.

—in Pennsylvania?

20

A,

Yes, Your Honor.

21

0.

How do the two procedures differ?

22

A.

I won't profess to be an expert on it, but basically

23

in a civil preceding all you——up until recently all you needed

24

was a certification by two doctors. Now in Pennsylvania, there

25

must be a hearing in front of Commonplace Judge, for a civil

8

1

commitment» This was a civil procedure, the Mental Health Act»

2

And they had sections in it basically which said that if a man

3

whofs in custody, or in prison, or serving time was found to

4

be imcompefcent he could be transferred to an institution for the
r

5

criminal insane»

6
7

There were no cases, Mr» Justice Blackmun, in Pennsylmraia,
where this had ever been done before.

Q,
9

Well, do 1 understand chat the sanity hearing and the

civil commitment procedure are or are not different in Pennsyl­

10

vania?

11

A

Well, basically now they'd be the same»

12

Q.

At the time. Were they the same at the time?

13

A

No, they were different.

14

Q.

One further question. Would he be likely to end up

15

-in a different institution under the sanity hearing then he

16

would if he were civilly committed?
A

17

The net result would probably be the same, and that's

13

why I presented the arguments of the District Attorneys and I

19

think Mr. Chief Justice Bell, and X know the trial judge, Jedge

2

Honeyman has said that X am taking advantage of this fellow,

21

whereas I'm not, because the realities of the situation is that

22

all they have is the confession they have a gun that they can't

23

use and if we went to trial based on over twenty years of ex­

24

perience X don't think they would get beyond a denturr, but if

25

they did get beyond a demurr, and John was convicted, what would

6
9

1

he get? He would not get the electric chair because the reality

2

of the situation is

3

him on the stand, and nobody would sentence him to the electric

4

chair so. the most he would get would be life»

that once the man was convicted I'd put

5

Now he's already been condemned to life in an institution

6

for the criminal insane which is far worse» They can call it a

7

hospital, but it's an institution for the criminal insane»
Q.

' 8
9

Wwll was he likely to end there held he been civilly

committed, in the same institution?
A.

10

Under present law, yes, sir» The institution could

11

transfer him and there would n8t be a tiling I could do about it

12

but at least he would have had Ms trial»
Q.

13
14

Now one 'further question and then I'll stop» Are you

familiar with the federal procedure' under 18USC 4244?

15

A.

No, I'm not, sir»

16

Q.

Well, my question is, and i'd be interested in your

17
18

reaction ulitmately, whereer if you prevail here, the federal
system is placed in jeopardy, constitutionally,
A

19

20

familiar with—
0.

21

22

But I can31-answer that question because I'm not

Could I just ask you I take it that when your client

was committed here that th& commisstion that was conceded found

23

that not only was he unfit to stand trial but that he had crim­

24

inal tendencies, is that right?
A,

25

7

Yes, sir,

.

10

1

Q

Let's assume that the state dropped the criminal

2

charges against your client right now. Would they have to re­

3

lease him?

4
S

A

Yes, sir. There's a procedure and he'd be commited

to Norristown State Hospital.
Q

S

Well, you mean the commission—--enough has already

7

happend in terms of procedings and findings to warrant this

G

confinement even if there were no criminal charges against him?

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

y

And so your claim really is narrowed down to wher'

11

ther or not you can prevent a person from having a trial.
A

12

13

right from

the very begining and I suppose-Q

14

15

Yes, sir. You see, that's been my issue

Well, if he were tried and £o.und innocent lie stays

exactly where he is.
A

16

No. No sie. If he were tried and found innocent they

17

would have to commit him to an ordinary state hospital. Here

18

he's in an institution for the criminal insane. That's the only

19

people who go there. Men who are-—
y

20

Well I just asked you a minute ago that if the state

21

dropped its charges against him whether he would stay exactly

22

where he is, and you said yes.

23

A

I interpreted your-—

24

Q

He gave the same answer to the question I asked.

25

A

I misunderstood~--by stay in the same place, I mean

8
11

1

he would be confined.

2

Now if he was tried--

3

Q

4

his confinement somewhere—

5

6

A

That's right. But one's a criminal institution and

the other's just a state hospital. Now—

7

C

There are enough findings already made to justify

Q

Can no one who is commited by civil procedings end

up in the institution that he is now in?

9

A

1 suppose it's possible if the—

10

Q

If they find he has criminal tendencies.

11

A

Yes , sir.

12

Q

But the commission here found he had criminal ten­

13

dencies »
A

14
15

basis of an illegal confession where he says that—Q

16

17

I know, Mr. Justice White, but they did it on the

Well, they didn’t just rest, as I understand it on

the fact that he was charged with this crime.
A

10

And hi sr army inmedical record, he didn't answer any

19

question?,

20

asked him to draw some squares and blocks. I dont know what—
Q

21

22

What's the basis for the commissions finding that he

had criminal tendencies?
A

23
24

because I didn't let him. He drew some figures, they

The confession where he said he killed five propie

because they had put the evil eye on his parents. And the army

schizophrenic.

I

Were

you permitted to put in evidence before the

connission?

3

A

No, sir, but—

4

Q

But you could have.

5

A

I could have, but. my evidence would have necessitated

S

putting John Bruno on the stand.

7

Now subsequent to the adoption of the sanity commissions

8

report, Judge Honeyman, who was the judge who appointed the

9

commission said that under the act I had a right to a hearing.

10

And I didn't ask for a hearing because 1 would have had the

1?

hearing in front of a judge and I would have had. to put John

12

on the stand.

13

So I simply filed exceptions to the sanity commission

14

recommendation.

'15

and a lawyer, a very distinguished senior member of our bar, but

16

he doesn't practice criminal law and he hasn't for at least

17

fifteen years, and that lawyer recieved an order, this is on the

18

recozcd from the judge, you admit John's army medical record.

19

By order of the court. Thay's all they had to decide - the army

20

said he's schisophrenic, and Jphn days he killed five prople -

21

he must have criminal tendencies.

Now he had two psychiatrists, the judge did,

22

And the record will also show that I said, and that I

23

offered to swear to it, that in my opinion as a lawyer, John, did

2.4

understand the nature of the proeadings against him, he knows

25

very well that he's been charged v/ith killing five people:# and
10
13

I

2

that he could confer with counsel. And they said, well we're
not interested—

3

Q

Did you undertake to have him examined by an indep­

4

endent psychiatrist, and have the psychiatrist testify to those

3

same facts?

S

A

I had him examined, Mr. Chief justice, but I didn't

7

have the psychiatrist testify. 1 had him examined to find out

S

primarily if .John is telling the truth and I'm still not sure

9

tisay if John killed these five people or his father did.

10

His father is---

1?

Q

Wouldn’t this have been the occasion for you to have

12

the psychiatrist at least to indicate the objective factors to

13

would shov; capacity to understand the nature of the charges and

14

cooperate with coulsel in defense?

15
16

A

think 1 had to do it—

17
13

Q

A

I know, but there were no statutes in Pennsylvania

that required that I do it that way and I felt that if John

21

22

Well, it's done every day in the week in a great

many places.

19

20

Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't want to do it. I did not

had been arrested and indicted and charged with five murder
that he had a right to stand trial.
I realise the state Supreme Court had narrowdd the issues.

23
24

The late Judtice Collins said this case raises the question of

25

the rights of an incompetent. Who decides whether he stands

11
1.4

1

trial? Two psychiatrists? Or his lawyer?

2
S

Q

Where is the sanity commissions report? is that in

the record?

4

A

5

Q

In the record?

S

A

Sir? Well, they didn’t print the record» They sent

7

down all the—--this is formal corpus»

0
9

Yes„ sir»

Q

Then it's your position then, I take it, that in

examinations such as went on here, connected with a criminal

10

charge, to see if he's competent to stand trial, that you were

11

privelidged not to have him testify»

12

A

Yes, sir»

13

Q

I mean before

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

Whereas youwouldn't

16

thecommission.

have had in the civil commit-

menfc (inaudible).
A

17

Yes, sir.

Now the Pennsylvania cases do say that

10

sanity commission procedings are not criminal nature. I say

19

they are in this case, because they committed him to an insti­

20

tution for the criminal insane. They’ve sentenced him.
Q

21

You mean your position is thay you can stop the

22

psychiatrist from talking to your client in order to decide

23

whether he’s competent to stand trial?
A

24
25

Yes, Mr. Justice White. Now the fact of the matter

is when they asked him to draw pictures and squares and blocks
12
1-5

-

1

I let him clo it and they showed him pictures and asked him what

2

this means to you and I let him do that , but I would not let

3

them ask him any questions .about the alleged five murders„

4

which obviously they wanted to do.

3
6

Q

Are there procedures in Pennsylvania whereyou can

test his present condition if yon wish?

7

A

0

Q

9

A

No, sir.

10

Q

“—or attempted

SI

A

12

sir„

Have you dont that since he was committed-—»

to?

No, sir. It would be done by the psychiatrist at

the institution.

^3
14

Right Mow? Yes,

Q

You haven9! requested that or made any proceedings

for it, have you ?

15

A

And I might add that I have never denied in any of

16

the hearings, to any of the judges or justices, that John's

17

menatlly sick, l°ve never denied that.

13

Q

Well, if you went to trial, as you requested, would

19

it not be the absolute duty of the court against all of this

20

background to see to it that he had a psychiatric examination

21

before he went to trial?

22
23

A

the way they ruled and I disagree with them,

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, that's what they say, and that's

Q

Well, do you take the position that the court would

hay© no obligations?
13
16

1

A

I think his competency, whether or not he is going

2

to plead insanity is personal to him» I don't see how on the one

3

hand as Mr» Justice Roberts said in his dissenting opinion, his

4

most recent one, how can the Commonwealth arrest someone, im­

5

prison him* this man has been confined now since April of 1966,

6

say that he signed this confession, and they're the prosecutor»

i

7

And on the next hand as soon as they realize, well we

Q

have a confession that we can't use, we have a gun'that we can’t

9

use, now they’re his benefactor. I don’t see how thay can be

10

both. And that’s what they’ve done,

11

And as I said in my brief, I think it’s frightening that

12

they can arrest a person and hold him for 25 - 26 hours, and

13

then say he signed this confession, he said he killed five peo­

14

ple, and to do it for the reason he said he did it, he must be

15

crazy, and especially since we can’t proove it, because we canst

16

use this confession we’re going to ship him off to (inaudible).

17

And that’s just what they did. And the record will show

18

that 1 fought every inch of the way simply to protect the re­

10

cord and about the only round I won I guess so far is when this

2Q-

honorable Court granted the Writ of Certiorari.
Q

21

Your claim, basically, and as I understand it your

22

sole claim, Mr. Quinlan, is this, and you tel ]

23

That until or unless you bring to the attention, you or the

24

defendant, as his coulsel, bring to the attemtion of the trial

25

court, that your client is or may be mentally incompetent, then

14
17

me if I’m wrong.

•I

the trial court,, under the constitution, has an absolute duty to

2

give your client a speedy public trial.

3

A

Yes, si®, that's ray position.

4

Q

And can do nothing else.

3

A

Yes, sir.

6

Q

That’s it.

7

A

That’s it.

ARGUMENT OF MILTON O. MOSS, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10

n

MR. MOSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

12

Court. I think there are certain factors that have been present­

13

ed to the Court by ray opponent that should be clarified.
I think that Your Honors will accurately find within the

14
15

record a complete safeguard of every constitutional right of

16

this defendant in the procedures that were taken against him by

17
18

the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the District Attorneys
office of Montgomery Coussfcy.
We have heard from Mr. Quinlan that the only piece of

IS

20

murder cases was in fact an alleged illegally obtained confes­

Zi

22

evidence that the Commonwealth . had in the prosecution for five

sion. It should be noted. Your Honors, that this defendant was
.

23
24
25

The District Attorney, yes, sir, petitioned

the

:ourt on his own motion as I felt he was required to do, to

Impanel a sanity commission under the Mental Health Act at that

time. And this was opposed by Defense Coulsel.
Previous to that issue, Your Honors will find in the doc­

ket entries of this case, that a suppression hearing was in fact

tie Id, evidence presented to the Court, and a rule given as to

21

the admisibility of evidence other than the confession. Namely

22

the admisibility of the gun that was located and found pursuant

23

to a valid search warrant issued by the Court, at the room oc­

Mr- Justice Stewart 1 think that that is the pin­

head of this case- It's the essence of the legal issue, that

brings us before this honorable Court- And I think that this,

as the Sourt has held in previous cases, is not afo absolute

19

rightVfe cannot subject an incompetent individual to a speedy

trial when he is incapable and unable to confer meaningfully

with hi® counsel, to exercise all of the constitutional rights

23

that he must do personally in the course of the trial, when he

24

is ubable to do so,
Q

25

Well, his point is that our procedure in this country

18
21

1

and in Pennsylvania and in each of the other 49 states under

2

the federal system that our procedure,, for better or for worse,

3

is an adversary procedure, and an adversary system, so that

4

until or unless he as the defendart raises the issue of incom­

5

petence or insanity, you have a single constitutional duty.
Having indicted him, having chosen to proceed criminally

6

7

against this man, having charged whm with murder and indicted

8

him for it, and required him to plead, that you have an absolute

9

constitutional duty to bring him to trial,

19

A

l think that is-*—

Q

You’re on one side of the case, and he's on the

12

other. And it's an adversary preceding,

13

A

1 think there are certain—

14

q

That it's-net your duty to look out for his.rights,

15

it's his duty to assert them if he wants to.
A

16

We are aware of his position, Mr. Justice Stewart,

n

and we have opposed that for numerous reasons. 1 think that the

13

Court can readily agree that there are numerous issues that

19

would violate the individuals rights himself. Not necessarily,

20

sir. He would be subjected to the same type of disposition if

z%

he :wex"e convicted, acquitted, acquitted on the grounds of insan­

22

ity, or commited pursuant to a civil commitment procedure pro­

23

vided for in the very same act of the preceding one.
Q

24
23

Let me ask you, let's assume you tried him and he

was acquitted, now what constitutional rights of his would have

19
22

1

been violated during the trial?

2

A

During the ferial?

3

By the trial.

I think this Court* Your Honor* has stated frequently

that the right

Not necessarily. We have a valid* bona fide criminal

it

the Court* we have sufficient evidence to proceed and convict

12

this man.
Q

13
14

He wants to say* well if you can convict me* maybe

your conviction will be no good* but I may be innocent.
A

15

Well* I think the law over the years has generally

16

encouraged useful acts. If we are going to permit this defendant

17

to order society to subject him to trial* when he is unable to

18

comprehend the nature of the charges * the defense itself or

19

cooperate with his counsel in any type of intelligent or mean-

20

ingful fashion* we will override the protection that society has

21

afforded in the past* and that is that he just cannot meaning­

22

fully participate. And why subject him to a trial on the merits

23

and thereafter allow him to raise the incompefcency issue?
Q

24
25

Mr. Moss* how does Pennsylvania define competency

to stand trial* by statute?
20
23

1

A

By statute,. Your Honor» It's under the (inaudible)

2

Q

What arefche standards?

3

A

The standard is this» It uses the terra "mental dis­

4

ability". It says"mental disability means any mental illness,

5

mental impairment, mental retardation, or mental defficieney

6

which so lessens the capacity of a person to use his customary

7

self control, judgement, and descration in the conduct of his

8

affairs and social relations as to make it necessary or adari's-

9

ible for him to be under care as provided in this Act".

But I'm getting just at the standard. Does Pennsyl­

A
Q

22

It has—
describing what the man's condition must be in order

to permit him to go to trial?
A

That is the standard for commitment. It is bolstered

Is that tine standard for judging competency to stand

The standard that is used, Your Honor, is the com­

The competency standard could not be sufficient in

the civil proceedings to confine a man?

9

A

1 would not think sof Mr. Justice Black.

10

Q

But you are confining him--- what nore than just that

11

competency standard was found here?
A

12
13

His criminal tendencies, his lack of self control,

his assertions—

14

Q

Why did they go on and make those findings?

15

A

I ” m sorry—

IS

Q

Why did they go on and make those findings about

17

criminal tendencies here?
A

13

Because they were part of the testimony and evidence

19

that was introduced and actually was in fact the criminal charge

£0

triggered the attention of the public to this mans conduct, and

2!

in competency.

Q

2.3

the meantime?

24

A

25

Mr. Moss, why has he not been civilly commited in

I think there’s been no definite determination on

that issue, Mr. Justice Blackmun, because of the tendency of

22
25

1

these various proceedings.

z

Q

Let me then ask you the same Question I asked Mr.

3

Quinlan. Is the ultimate result the same, to wit, incarceration,

4

if we can call if that, anyway, placement in the same type of

5

institution, whether the route followed is that of civil commit­

6

ment or that of a sanity hearing?
A

7

The eventual place of commitment, Your Honor, will

8

be the very same. His course of treatment will be the very same.

9

This is not, as it has been referred a confinement facility.

jo

This-is a hospital. Part of the hospital system of the

I!

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And he will be there primarily

12

because of the maximam security type of protection for society

13

that is necessary- from this individual.

«4

Q

Then your answer- to my first question would not

IS

be to wit, there is no civil commitment procedure because it

16

would be useless - he's already where he would end up.
A

17

He would end up here, Mr. Justice Blackmun, under

18

any circumstances imaginable. Either as a result of criminal

19

trials and the verdicts that would be rendered by that jury, or

20

through civil commitment.
Q

21

One last question.

Is the release standard the same

22

under confinement because of the sanity commission and the

23

Courts determination, as it would be after civil commitment?
A

24
25

Ho. Under a sanity commissiton, this defendant has

a right to pursue a writ of hafosas corpus at any stage of the
23
26

1
2

procedings when he is„ or at least represents, that he is com”
petent to be released, remanded back to the trial level, to stand

3

trial on the charges» This has not been pursued, and as a matter

4

of fact there is a level of the defendants (inaudible) status.

5

He is evaluated periodically to determine his competency to

6

stand trial and answer the criminal charges.

7

8

This has not been pursued in the last three and a half
years, since his commitment by order,

9

Q

But if he went to the Common Pleas Court with a writ

10

of habeas corpus he would have to sustain some of the burden

II

of showing what you contend he cannot show, and therefore the

12

Common Pleas Court would likely be somewhat influenced by the

13

Pennsylvania Supreme Court's holding, would they not?

14

A

I don't think so, Mr, Chief Justice, This defendant

15

has a right not only to pursue the matter on a writ of hah;eab

10

corpus, but can be examined by his own physician, unrelated to

17

the institution where he is committed, and present evidence on

IS

his own behalf as to his competency,

19

Q

But counsel has indicated that ha did not elect to

20

follow that course, originally. Is there any reason to believe

21

that on a habeas corpus preceding that he would be any more

22

inclined to put in the testimony of a psychiatrist?

23

A

If the contentsoof this defendants psychiatric re­

24

ports , periodic reports and evaluations by Farview state Hos­

25

pital are as they are as of September 28, 1970, he would not

24

27

1

have any success? in any release. This man is convinced of his

2

dedication in life to annihilate the seven on his list and in

3

the event this brings no relief to his psychotic mother he will

4

find and 'Search out other people in the community whom he feels

5

is responsible for his mothers condition. And this is so stated

6

in the record.

7

Q

8

Perhaps you've already said it, did the findings that

the commission made satisfy civil commitment standards?

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

What does a civil commitment have to conclude to

11

confine a person?
A

12

Whenever a person is believed to be mentally dis­

13

abled and in need of care or treatment by reason of such mental

14

disability andexamination of such person has teen made by a pay-

15

sician or physicians or for any reason the examination of such

16

person cannot be made, a petition may be presented to the Court

17

of Common Pleas of the county in which the person resides dr is

18

for his immediate examination or commitment, to an appropriate

19

facility for examination, observation, and diagnosis. And they

20

thereafter adopt the same type of mental disability standard

21

by which the individual would be committed.
Q

22
23

So under the civil procedings he wouldn'teven have

to be found to have criminal tendencies?

24

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

25

We have an exaggerated case here of an individual who is
25

28

1

terribly psychotic, has in fact murdered five people, and is des­

E

tined to murder others if released upon society,

«T*

4

Q

Of course if he's psychotic he didn't murder them.

Killedthem, maybe, but he's not guilty of murder,

5

A

That is true, Your Honor, I think the Commonwealth

6

in any preceding would acknowledge the defendants incompetency

7

and insanity.

8

The records—

9

Q

10

So then it's not really murder, if the facts you

state are correct,
A

11

And if we were to do this, sir, and a court would

12

proceed the trial regardless of the verdict that would be entered.

13

And this defendant would be commited to Farview State Hospital

14

for treatment and rehabilitation and/or release,
Q

15

If this man were brought to trial, as he urges, in

16

your view would it be the obligation of the prosecutor to bring

17

his medical history to the attention of the Court if he failed

18

to do so on his own behalf?
A

18

Mr, Chief Justice I8ve weighed that very problem and

20

I have kicked it around in my own mind as to whether or not it

21

is my“obligation, 1 suggest to four Honor that this would be

22

my obligation in the event that the defense counsel gabe no in­

23

dication of raising an insanity defense,
Q

24
25

I think the American Bar Association standards for

the prosecution, the conduct of the prosecution would say that
26
29

1

you. have an absolute duty to do so»

z

A

I’m glad that T. think-my inclination was consistent

3

with the standard of ethics» but I feel that it is the obligation

4

of the prosecution to interpose any favorable type of evidence

5

that is in our possession»
As a matter of fact, as in the possession of the defen­

6
7

dant as well» And at no time, other than today, have I been

8

aware of Mr, Quinlan's assertion of his knowledge of an insanity

9

defense» I think wa have a counsel for the defendant in .this

10

case who may not be counsel throughout the entire procedings on

n

this case, and we are not assured of the defendants full pro­

12

tection by his being speeded to trial when he is unable to

'13

really comprehend the charges»

14

And it would only take a monent to—

15

9

Would you still be making the same argument if all

m

the commission had found was that he's incapable of understanding

n

the situation with which he's faced and is incapable of cooper-

18

ating with counsel, and if the commission had not gone on and

19

found that he had criminal tendencies?

20

2!
22

And that was the only finding that was made?

Q

Yes, but it was suffieient to satisfy 'the incompeten::

to stand trial standard in Pennsylvania»
A

23
24

A

It would depend on what other information we would

have Available to us. in evaluating whether we should proceed»
Q

25

21

Because -that seems to be a more interesting question

'

30

t

which is perhaps unreachable because 'die commission also found

2

the criminal tendencies. But would you say Pennsylvania could

3

continue to hold a person for the rest of his life without a

4

trial just because you found he was incompetent to stand trial,

5

and that he would never get any better?

6

A

1 don't think so, Mr. Justice White-—-

7

Q

What would you do—

8

A

I think there8d have to be a lot more—--

9

Q

What would you do if Pennsylvania—you' d have to

10

civilly commit him if you wanted to hold him.

11

A

If we wanted to do that or if we were not satis­

12

fied with the validity of thcs’.e findings, we would proceed to

IS

trial'——
Q

14

Let's say that everybody conceeds that the findings

15

are valid, both defense and prosecution, that he's- incompetent

16

to stand trial. That it's not found that he's a danger to him­

17

self or abybody else. Would you say you could continue to hold

18

him just because you had a charge against him?

19

A

20

Q

But you couldn't. He's incompetent to stand trial.

21

A

If those were the only .findings, we would not.

22

Q

Then what would you do?

23

A

He would just proceed

time of criminal charges by hoi» pressing the charges against

And then that would bring up whether or not there

That normally is in conjunction with the findings,

recommendations, and reports that are submitted to us periodical­
ly by the institution itself»

11

Q

How did you get (inaudible) —

12

A

Unfortunatley, Mr, Justice Black, he was not ap­

13

prehended by the police until 196S after his fifth murder»

14

Q

Oh, he was not caught.

15

A

That's correct. And it was at that time that we pre­

m

cede! with our action.
Q

17
18

In Pennsylvania practice is the prosecutor in a po-

siton to institute a civil commitment preceding?
A

19

Yes, sir. We suggest to the Court that we do have a

20

conflict between the right of his fair trial and the right of a

21

speedy trial. There are numerous reasons why we would not want

22

to subject the defendant to the speedy trial. The court has

23

definitely held that to proceed and prosecute a defendant who

24

is incompetent violates due process, and we are not violating

25

the right to a speedy trial. We are merely defering it until such
29
32

„

i

time that the defendant casi exercise

z

counsel, the personal

3

cide upon during the course of the trial. We feel that the

4

standards by which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania proceeds

in matters of this type

6

therefore suggest to this Court that this defendant is not

competent and not able to proceed to trial in spite of the re­

rebuttal.

13

I'm afraid X8m not making my point here. I say by.what

14

right does the Commonwealth arrest a man, indict him, and then

IS

say no, we1 re not going to put him to trial because the sanity

■16

commission says he has criminal tendencies, and the only thing

M

in the record before the sanity commission for them to conclude

18

that he had criminal tendencies, was the illegal confession.
Q

19

But Mr. Quinlan, the basic finding that they made

20

was that ha was not competent to stand trial. That he cannot

21

understand and cooperate, doesn't understand the nature of the

22

charges. That's why he is being held, not because of his con­

23

fession.
A

24
25

Well, the only criminal tendencies-—--the only thing

they had in front of then was that he said he killed five people
30

33

\

for these erassy reasons and they had no right to conclude that

2

he could not confer with counsel and did not understand the na­

3

ture of the proceedings because I was there and as his lawyer I

4

said he does understand them, and he has conferred with me, and

5

I'll swear to it.

6

NOW—

7

Q

8

Mr. Quinlan, why didn't somebody have a right to

conclude that five killings was enough?
A

9.

Mr. Justice Black, this man, and the record shows

10

this, was taken into custody with his father, held for 24 hours,

n

before the Justice of the Peace said his rights having been ess-

12

plained to him, Thr€-:e times, and this is in the record, the

13

then District Attorney swore under oath, and all this is in the

14

Appendix, that John Brunos rights were explained to him, and

15

he undersotod what he was being held for.

16

He swore to all this whan he filed answers to ray motions

17

to suppress answers to ray petitions to dismiss the sanity con-

18

mission, he said John Brunos constitutional rights had not been

19

offended because we explained everything to him, and he under­

20

stood it.

21

Now they can't have it both ways—

22

Q

23

ways—

24

A

Yes, sir, and—

to take the stand and—

7

I offered to do that. That's in the record. I offered

Q

Did you have an associate counsel there who could

have conducted the examination?

9

A

No, siras I say, I'm sort of a volunteer in this

10

case, but the case, and I think the transcript of the docket

11

entries will show, it sort of deteriorated into whether or not

12

Hr. Quinlan was going to force a trial in this case, or whether

13

the District Attorney was going to be able to sweep under the

14

rug, the fact that he had announced publically that five mur­

15

ders had been solved, he solved them, with his staff, but now

16

I'm not going to put them on trial.

17

Now three times under oath, the District Attorney says I

IS

explained all his rights to him. Now how could he do that? This

19

confession was illegal under Escobito. We didn't need Miranda

20

for this.

21
22

Q

Mr. Quinlan, how do you account for the fact that

he's still there,

they haven't released him—

>

23
24
25

t

A

Mr. Justice Marshall, they'll never release him.

Q

If he is insane and if he sever gets sane, they

will not release him..
35

1

A

Mo j, they won81.

2

Q

That's righto But the independent body which is the

3

ital, I assume, has found that he's insane. The reason I

4

that is because he’s still, there» And is it not true that if

5

find him sane they will release him?

S

A

They're supposed to certify him for trial.

Well? that's what I mean. But they haven't done that.

8

A

I don't get any information from them. This is a

institution» Under the auspices

Q

But state institutions aren't illegal—

It

A

No, 1 don't mean that——

»2

Q

Just because they're state institutions.

13

A

But they don"t send me reports. Ive never seen a re-

And I also understand you haven't tried to get one»

37

A

No, I didn't.

18

Q

Didn't somebody on this Court ask you if you tried fcc

20

A

No, I said I did not try to get one.

21

Q

You did not?

22

A

No, this case has been in litigation up through 1969»

23

Q

Well, assume noti? that this Court grants you the re-

19

24

lief you want» And he's brought back in. Where's he going to

25

be brought? To the criminal court?

33
36

?

z

A

have to put him on ferial. And I'll defend him»

3
4

Q

And suppose he5 s obviously insane in the courtroom„

Then what happens?

5

A

6

Q

7

A

8

If I get the relief that I've asked for, yes, they8d

If it's obvious

that he's insane?

Yes. Six psychiatrists testify

that—

Well, it wouldn't happen that way. If they bring

his* to trial—

9

Q

How do you know?

10

A

Well, I'd—

11

Q

You're not a psychiatrist, are you?

12

A

No, Mr. Justice Marshall.

13

Q

Well there, do you see? How

14

do you know whether he's

sane or not?

15

A

Because I—

IS

Q

(inaudible)—-a

17

A

I have never pleaded a defense of insanity.

IS

Q

And until or unless you do, there'll be no psy­

19

defense of insanity, isn't that it?

chiatrist abound.

20

A

Exactly.

21

Q

Prosecution may put the psychiatric testimony on—

22

A

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

is a ©ery easy sol­

23

ution to this whole case, which I propose under our rules. That

24

a jury could have been impaneled and the Commonwealth could have

25

put a psychiatrist on the stand, and without any other testimony
34
37

1

the trial judge could have said I declare this man not guilty

z

by reason of insanity and this fellow would have been committed

3

to an Army hospital in Coatsville, Pennsylvania with maximos se-

4

eurifcy.

S

New before I sit down I'd like to suggest by analogy one

6

frightening thing that could happen because of this type of pro­

7

cedure, There's a youngster who lives in my community who's now

8

20 or 21. He's mentally unbalanced. He's constantly talking about

9

girls, and I would like a girl, and this and that. The neigh-

10

bors complain. He's never been in trouble. When and if there's

11

a sex crime in this community ha's going to be the first boy

12

the police pick up, he's going to sign anything they want him to

13

sign, which is just what happened to John Bruno, because the

!4

record shows, if you sign this John, we'il take care of you, and

15

taking care of him meant sending him to a hospital.

\

They-can take this fellow to the Court House, say he signed

16

1?

a confession, that he committed all these terrible crimes, and

18

if he did it he's obviously mentali^ incompetent, and ship.,him

19

off to Farwiew. And if they can do this to John Bruno, I res­

20

pectfully submit that they can do it to anybody.
Q

21

22

Mr, Quinlan, as 1 understand it the relief you're

requesting is an order requiring that he be put to trial.

23

A

Yes, sir,

24

Q

Suppose that this relief were granted and the state

25

moved as Mr, Moss said he had the power to move, for a civil
35

38

!

committment* Would you oppose this?

2

.

A

Wot if they first directed a verdict of not guilty

3

bf reason of insanity. I donst want this hanging over his head

4

for the rest of his life.

5

Q

Well, do they have to do this?

6

A

Either that or put him on trial.

?

Q

Back to my question. Suppose they started the nach-

8

inery moving for a civil commitment. What would be your response

9

as his counsel?

m

A

I would object to it,

because they would have him

13

civilly commifced to an ordinary mental hospital, and then

32

through their inter-hospital procedures they would transfer him

33

back to Farview.

14

Q

So that he would end

up exactly where he is now.

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

How can you prevent that?

17

A

Well, I guess just file more petitions for writs of

/■

18

habeas corpus, that's the way I've been doing it so far, although.

19

I haven't been too sucessful. I just think it8s terrible—

20

Q

Mr. Quinlan, suppose—

21

A

That they can do—

22

Q

Instead—

23

A

——-such a thing.

24

Q

25

Instead of that route, as Mr. Justice Blackmon sug­

gested, suppose the state now decides to give up, and they bring
36
39

I

your man into the Common Pleas Court for trial, against this

z

background have you any doubt that the Common Pleas Judge is

3

going to first conduct a hearing to determine for himself whether

4

your client is. competent to stand trial by the standards of com­

5

mon law? Isn't that what he's going to do?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

Well, then if he decides that he's not competent

8

to stand trial, he's right bask where he is now residing, isn't

9

he?

10

A

Yes, sir. Except for this, though. The Common Law

11

as outlined in the (inaudible), and this is in all the dissenting

12

opinions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, that's why I didn't
. ir
cite any cases in my brief.

13

I rely on the Constitution , and the Supreme Court of Penn­

14

IS

sylvania reviewed all the cases on this subject—

16

Q

Yes, but you just have -the dissenters on your side.

17

A

Well, that's been my role in this whole case. We've

18

lest all time—-as I say, if -they can do this to John Bruno,

19

they can do it to me on my way home, when 1 cross the county

20

line they can pick me up, hold me for 24 hours, coma on televi?»

21

sion the next day. They can announce to the press "Quinlan

22

committed sex crimes, and he did it because he hates his mo-

23

fcher", and anybody who'll do that because he hates his mother

24

is crazy. And knowing that they can't proove it, they ship me

25

off to Farview.
37

40

I

Now maybe this has happened a lot of times? I don't know.

2

I just sort of stumbled into this case.

3
4

Q

The record seems to show that he's stated a number

of times that an evil eye is on him. Do you know that or not?

5

A

They say that in the confession he—

S

Q

Do you know—

7

A

Do I >>now it?

8

Q

Do you know whether or not he thinks an evil eye

'

9

is on him?

10

A

Yes? sir? I do know it.

II

Q

Well? do you not think it3s your duty instead of

12

trying to get him tried by the Court to tell the Court that you

1.3

think he's insame?
A

14

Well? I don't think he ought to have five'indictments

15

becuase 1 know Bruno? and I know his father? and his father be­

16

lieves the same thing? 1 don't know who killed these five people,

17

I don't think the District Attorneys office does.
Q

18

I dont mean who killed them., Do you not believe that

19

a man who thinks there's an evil eye chasing him around over the

20

area.is .insane?
A

21

Should be committed?

Yes? and I made arrangements through the Department

22

of the r^rmy to have him committed to CoatsviXle maximum security

23

building.

24

Q

Well? why do you want him tried?

25

A

Because the Army will not so commit him as long as

38
41

!

there*-s a pending criminal charge against him»

2

Q

You want to get

3

A

Yes, sir,

4

Q

And that5s all itas about?

5

A

him committed to another place„

If you put him out on the street, no, its not all

8

that it’s about,All that it's about is that can they deny my

1

man a right to a trial?
©

8
9
10

You want to get these criminal charges disposed of,

because until they are, the Army will not takehim, isn°t that
right?

11

A

That's correct,

iZ

Q

That's the reason you“re making this claim in this

A

One of them, yes,

Q

You would be satisfied if they didn't try him, they

13

case.

14
13
16

just nolo pressed the charges.
A

Yes, sir,

13

Q

He'd still stay where he is.

19

A

17

20
21

22

transferred to the Army. I have a letter'saying so. They'd put
him in a Veterans Hospital, with maximum security. And some
psychiatric help which he's not going to get in Farview.
Q

23
24
23

Well, I don't think so, I think I could have him

You don't think Pennsylvania has gone through en­

ough procedings already to hold him except during the pendancy
of the criminal dharge?
39
42

I

A

Well* of course* they've held him for going on five

z

years* now. I think that if they nolo pros, the indictments

3

through a petition for writ of habeas corpus I would prevail*

4

and have him confined to a veterans hospital.
Q

S

6

You think he0 s not guilty on the grounds of insanity

I guess.

7

A

0

Q

They just can't proove the charge?

9

A

They just ean9t proove it. And icm not sure in my

10

own mind

11

did.

12

Q

13

A

14

No* Mr.-Justice Black* X—

whetherJohn killed these five people or his father

They can't proove he's insane?
How are they going to proove h@ss insane? X'n not

going to put him on the-”

15

Q

I understood you to—

16

A

The realities of it is what—

Q

I understood you to say that an evil eye was -chasing

17
18
19

20

2!
22
23
24

25

him all around—
A

Well* really the problem here is that John Bruno and

his lawyer Quinlan win no matter what happens* because if. they
convict him in front of a jury* I then put him on the stand* or
put on a psychiatrist

and no one will send him to the electric

chair. He's going to get life. Which is what he's got now* with­
out a trial.
Q

Hav

you tried to arrange with

43

the prosecuting at-

t1

torney or the judge to do something with the case that would

z

permit the Army to put him in as an insane man? I understood

3

you to say that's what you want.

4
5

A

I did that, Mr. Justice Black. 1 Tried, through the

former District Attorney and the judge, to bring him to trial,
t

6

empanel a jury——

7

Q

But you don't, have to bring him to trial, do you?

8

A

Well, either that or nol. pros, the indictments.

9

Q

Suppose the government would agree to take him?

10

A

They won't, Your Honor.

?!

Q

Have you tried it?

12

A

Yes p sir.

13

14

I have correspondence saying we wonBt take him while
there are open criminal charges against him.

15

Q

16

that, or not?

M

A

?8

Q

1 think your time is up, Mr. Quinlan, thank you.

Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted.

2?

22

Ho. they flatly said no. Wot this District Attorney,

his predecessor.

19
20

Has the District Attorney agreed to help you on
