MR. CHIEF JU TICE BURGER:

_s

Moore vs. Charlotte-

Mecklenburg,, No. 498.

4
5

n g

Mr. Blakeney, you may proceed whenever you are

6

ready.
WHITEFORD . BLAKENEY, E Q., ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. BLAKENEY: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

7

Court, I believe that this Moore case will furnish to- the
Court more truly than, is to be found elsewhere in the

9

Charlotte-Meckleriburg litigation clarity and certainty and,

10

indeed, their solution for the problem with which the Court is

11

now wrestling.
These qualities emerge, if the Court please, first,

12

13

I think, because in this case and only in this case are there

14

individuals before the Court pleading their constitutional

15

right against the compulsions which have been imposed below.
This Court has often recognized, of course, that

16

17

that puts constitutional questions in its clearest liqbt.
Furthermore,, if the Court please, the compulsions

18
19

which have been imposed are all opposed by these Moore plain­

20

tiffs for whom I appear.

21

the rest.

22

which have been fastened upon them below.

23

They do not accept some and reject

They oppose all the compulsions of racial nature

By contrast, as Your Honors will have noted, the

24

plaintiffs in

wann, of course, in the District Court below,

25

to be sure, support all the compulsions which have been imposed.
2

1

On the other hand» the Char lot te-Meekleriburg Board

2

of Education, defendant in this case, acquiesces in some of

3

the compulsions and oppose some of them.

4

The Solicitor General acquiesces in such as may be

5

regarded as reasonable — pardon me, the Solicitor General

6

more specifically in such as may be regarded as feasible.

i

■

1

And the Circuit Court below* in such as may toe regarded as

8

reasonable.

&

Q

to

between those two words?

11

A

Are you able to draw any dictionary distinctions

I myself am not able to draw any distinction

satisfactory to myself* Your Honor.

12

In any event* we stand against all the racial com-

13

14

'

15

10

pulsions* and that is our posture in this case.,

And frcm be­

ginning fco end* our position may be summarised thus briefly:
We obtained an injunction below which expresses it.

17

This injunction said to the Charlotte-MecKlenburg Board Of

IS

Education and to any agency imposing these compulsions, it

1®

said do not bar any child from any school in Charlotte-

20

Mecklenburg because of his race* and do not assign children to

21

any Charlotfce-Meeklenburg school on the basis of race.

22

This is our theme, as I say, at all stages.

23

Q

Your clients are who, Mrs. Moore —

24

A

And others.

25

i

I am not interested in that.

I don't need fco know their names.
But they are the parents of white
O

J

i

i

1

public school children as well as Negro public school children.

2

4
S

Both?

A

Both, Your Honor.
What do you do about the problem of disestab­

Q

lishing the de jure segregated school system?

6

7

Q

A

Your Honor* that is* of course, a central sub­

ject that I will come to, but

8

Q

a

A

In your own time.
I will answer it now.

I will,

*0

cause it is indeed, of course, the heart,

11

of the problem.
Q

12
13

if I may, be­

the ultimate heart

Because taking what you said literally, then,

there is no power.

14

A

15

Q

16

.ft

There is no power* we say* Your Honor
To disestablish it.

There is no power to trample the constitutional

17

right of any citizen in the disestablishing process, and the

18

constitutional right of these citizens* these plaintiffs* is

19

that they shall not be barred on racial grounds and they shall

20

not be assigned on racial grounds, and that is what is being

21

done to them.

22

Q

But a person, we assume, is caught in a ghetto

23

as established by the state, and he doesn't have the resources

24

to get out.

-

25

What is your solution then?
A

The Constitution says ---4

1

Q

That he should take his course?

2

A

The Constitution says to him, the Constitution. I

!

3

is expounded in Brown, we say that the Constitution, seeing

4

his situation, says to him, every effort is going to be ex­

5

erted and all zeal and all absolute good faith must be put into

6

effect to see' to it that you are given freedom, that you shall

7

not be barred anywhere on account of your race, and that you

S

shall not be assigned anywhere on account of your race.

And I
i

9

think that is what this Court was referring ’to in the cases it

10

has recently decided»

11

impatience with the fact that freedom was not truly accorded

12

as this Court considered in many of these cases, such as Hew

13

Kent and Carter and Alexander vs. Holmes,

14

This Court was expressing its stern

And we go one-hundred percent with all and any who

15

will see to it that the freedom is truly there.

16

freedom is truly accorded, that freedom from governmental

17

action based on race, once that freedom is truly accorded, then

18

we say it is not to be said that the Constitution then requires

19

that the freedom of any person be taken from him in the process

29

of the dismantling.

21

But once that

To express it otherwise, Your Honor, the dismantling

22

process shall not itself reconstruct the very thing that is

23

being dismantled.

24

Constitution, so Brown commanded us, says you shan't travel

25

the racial road in/ the matter of public schools.

Or, to use still another analogy, the

5

i

Now,. Your Honor, our basic theme is you can't

?
2

travel that same racial road in, so to speak:, remedying the

S

constitutional wrong of the past.

4

stitutional wrong of a racial nature by imposing present con­

S

stitutional wrong of racial nature.
Q

6

You do not remedy past con­

Would you consider that it is under the

7

Constitution if the school board, not the Court, the school

8

board closed all of the entirely Negro schools and provided

9

public transportation of the students of those schools into

'10

other schools to accomplish the dismantling as they saw it?
A

1!

We think that the Constitution, Your Honor,

12

cannot be said to require that any action be taken which has

13

as its sole objective racial assignments.

14

Q

Does it prohibit it?

15

A

It prohibits it.

16

Q

In other words --

17

A

That is what Brown says.

18

Q

--- your answer to my question would be, then,

19

that the school board could not close these schools and trans­

20

port the students out to other schools in the outlying dis­

21

tricts?

22

A

If, Your Honor, in the operation of the schools

23

on a natural geographic or other non-racial basis, such

24

action can naturally, can normally educationally, very well.
But if the school board's action and purpose
6

to accomplish

•i

assignments on racial basis, which otherwise would not be done,

2

but if indeed done, the child is pushed, the child is taken,

3

the child is compelled solely because of his color, then that

4

runs afoul of the Constitution right there, just as truly as

5

what existed in Brown, and

6

right here that the plaintiffs pled in Brown.

7

vxb

plead the same constitutional

Now, quickly. Your Honor, since jurisdiction in

8

this case was deferred, I should spend a moment on how we come

9

here, I think.

1 will try not to take too much time on that

19

because it is developed in our brief, our jurisdictional

11

statement, and also a typewritten response which we filed only !

12

a few days ago in answer to a suggestion filed by the Swann

13

plaintiffs, only a few days.

14

those documents.

We beg the Court's attention to

But fco outline briefly, these plaintiffs, upon

15
16

learning in February of this year that certain compulsions

17

were being imposed -- were about fco be imposed upon them, went

18

into the State Court of North Carolina.

19

an injunction, an injunction which we say is in the terms of

20

the essential meaning of Brown, and an injunction which is in

21

the terms of a North Carolina statute also, and those terms

22

simply were what I have already repeated -- do not assign a

23

child on the basis of his race, any other basis but not his

24

race, do not exclude him from a school because of his race.

25

There they obtained

Nov/, that injunction was -- our case was moved into
;

1

7

1

the federal court at that point, upon valid federal grounds,

2

as we understand, and the defendant Board of Education asked

3

for a three-judge court to determine the constitutionality of

4

the pronouncement of the statute which, as I say, was the

3

very words of the injunction that we had.

S

Before the three-judge convened and heard the case,

7

the district court below set aside our injunction, the single

8

judge set it aside, saying, in the express terms that he did

a

so, pending the rulings of the three-judge court and of this

10

Court,
Now, the three-judge court heard the case and ruled

ii
12

that the words I have already expressed. Your Honor, are un­

13

constitutional, and here came a remarkable inconsistency, an

14

inconsistency that is deep and inherent and afflicts all who

15

seek, 1 respectfully say, rises again and again to plague all

16

ttfho seek to say we will obey Brown, which commands operating

17

schools on a noil-racial basis, we will obey Brown by the

IS

very act of operating them on a non-racial basis.

19

Here is the ineonsistency that the court itself

20

expressed:

21

indeed it is the essence of Brown, that you shall not exclude

22

a child from a public school on the ground of his race, but it

23

is unconstitutional to say that he may not be assigned to a

24

school on the basis of his race.

25

It says it is constitutional, quite constitutional,

Those two things,• Your Honor, are absolutely in
8

\

conflict.

z

there can be no prohibition against assigning the child on the

3

basis of his race., and if you do therefore assign him on the

4

basis of his race, you are excluding him on the basis of race

5

from another school,, the school to which he wishes to go or

6

which he may have been attending, and to which it is natural

7

geographically or otherwise that he should attend.

8
9
10

They are inherently so.

Q

Your, argument is based entirely on the 14th

Amendment of the United States Constitution and not at all on
any federal statute, is it?
Entirely.

11

A

12

Q

Entirely on this?

A

Yes.

Is it not obvious that if

We stand or fall, of course, on the

A

Parents and children.

The children themselves

Q

And therefore you are making no claim with

respect to the constitutionality of the integration of faculty?

22

A

Mo.

23

Mow, we present this question. Your Honors, not in

24

the abstract.

We show the factual background in Charlotfce-

25

Meeklenburg, where these children go to school.
9

We show in

1

this record,, and it is concise, these things, quickly:

2

as far back as 1965 this school system was adjudged by the

8

district court, the Southern District Court, the same district

4

court, albeit a different judge, was adjudged to be operating

S

on a non-racial basis,, a basis in which there was no gerry­

6

mandering of school attendance zones and there was complete

7

freedom of transfer,, and so it was adjudged non-racial, and

8

the Circuit Court upheld that.

That

9

And now it was adjudged within the past year, the

1©

same district court, with now the new judge, reaffirmed many

1!

of those factual findings, adjudged, for example, that in no

12

other public school system had the board of education achieved

13

as much in the' way of racial mixing -- no other case that had

14

come before the appellate court had so much been achieved of

15

that, nature, that there was and is now no racial purpose,

16

motive or element in the spending of money, in the providing

17

of facilities, faculties, schools, buildings, books, and

18

enumerated numerous others.

19

nevertheless, Your Honors, upon that picture there

2©

came order sofu nusual severity, these orders said, despite

21

the factors just found, it is also true that in some schools

22

there is not the mixture of the community, therefore this

23

court will order that the mixture of the community shall

24

take place in every school.

25

And the court went on to say, this shall be main10

1

tained henceforth, and note these words, almost revealing in

2

its paradox,, these words — just as was done for decades

3

before Brown.

4

racial until now ordered to be racial.

And there is the situation, Your Honors, non-

5

Now, furthermore, I have already mentioned that

6

these plaintiffs occupy a posture different from any other

7

parties in the Char lotte-Mecklehburg litigation in that they

8

plead their own constitutional right? none others do.

They

also raise opposition on an issue which the Chief Justice,
10

concurring in Northcross, said was one of the questions that

11

needed attention.

Only these plaintiffs raise that issue.

12

other parties do.

That issue is uncontested before this Court,

13

except and unless than we raise it.

14

That issue is this:

they are.of two essential natures, all the compulsions can be

16

categorised under two headings.

proposed, and which of course all parties other than ourselves

are now accepting.

Number one, the gerrymandering

We oppose that gerrymandering.

And now all other compulsions here come under the

heading of requirement that the child go long distances to

compulsion, the requirement that we go away from the natural

geographic school and near the child's home that he be forced

10

to go away from that, whether in a gerrymandered new zone or

11

whether crossing the boundaries of the gerrymandered zone into

12

another zone.

Now, the distances, however, are not our point, nor

13

That is a colloquialism.

You don’t mean to say it is a matter of —

14

that absolutely a school board could never send a child away

from neighborhood for any reason?

!6

A

No, I do not say that.

17

Q

There can certainly be a lot of good reasons

to send children away from — you say they should not --

where were they sending them that they couldn’t do so on ac­

20

count of race?

Brown forbids their doing so on account of

And you say that gerrymandering, racial gerry­

basis is invalid.

Invalid.

And I suppose you would say the majority, the

Indeed* this Court so held in Co3s, Goss vs.

I

A

9

No.

There was an interaction, compulsory upon

10

the child and shaped and based on no grounds* it is solely

1!

that.

12

that determines where he will go to school.

13

The child is looked that* his color is observed* and

Q

So there are two rules that apply under the

14

transfer from the majority to minority transfer rule* and ovse

15

of them is white and one of them is black, and the transfer

IS

is to a school with a white majority and a black minority,

17

the two children transferring will not both be transferred,

18

only one will be.

19

A

That is true, but ~~

20

Q

The black one will get the transfer and the

21

white one won't.

22

A

Yes, and that is —

Q

Or the reverse* if a transfer from a white

school is requested.

And that is selectivity on the basis of race.

I see that you told Justice Stewart that you

didn't rely on any federal statute.

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

I see you cite the federal statute that is in

10
11

the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
A

That is true. Your Honor, but only for this

12

purpose, of showing that when it comes to the action of the

13

elected representatives of the people,, this is not a consti­

14

tutional point, but it is significant to note that no elected

15

representative of the people have ever enacted any legislation

16

in the direction which we here oppose and which we say the

17

C on sfcitufcion pr ohibits.

13

The Congress, in the Civil Rights Act specifically,

13

twice expressed itself to this effect — let it not be thought

20

— this is the meaning of it, I take it — let it not be thought

21

that in this Civil Rights Act we mean to condone or to provide

22

for or in any way authorise racial balance, racial ratios

23

compelling anybody to go anywhere just because of Ms race.

24

This Act does not mean that.

the Court.

I will speak very briefly to the statute.

The

8

position the board has taken with reference to the statute,

9

that it is a reexpression of the statements of Brown, non-

racial assignment of students; but,

11

the statute also carries with it a permission to disestablish

12

a dual system.

At one time we had hoped that

we would be able to stretch Brown, being intellectually

7

I don't feel that the board plan would be truly constitution­

8

al because it does take race too much into account and goes

9

outside the compactness that Brown spoke of.

10

I don't think that the statute would prohibit a de­

11

segregation technique such as the location of a new school.

12

This would accomplish the assignment of students, by locating

13

a school in a border zone, where again they would be assigned

It seems that, in listening to the arguments that
were made yesterday, if this Court is to adopt an approach

10

other than the neighborhood school system of student assign­

11

ment, if this Court is to adopt a reasonableness approach or

12

a feasibility approach, we are going to have the same amount

13

of litigation if not more litigation than we have experienced

14

since Brown, since the Court said that you must use all de­

15

liberate speed.

16

At the time the Worth Carolina General Assembly en­

17

acted this legislation, which was in July of 1969, there were

18

two cases that had been decided by the Supreme Court that it

19
20

had to go by, that is Brown and Green. And also the General
✓
Assembly was guided by sections 401 and 407 of the Civil

21

Rights Act of 1964, which we think this statute embraces, as

22

it dees embrace Brown and Green.

23

Now, in Green, as this Court suggested, of course,

24

that was a rather simplistic fact situation there where you

25

had only two schools involved, and the Court suggested, as I
29

1

recall, in footnote 6, that the easiest way to eliminate the

2

dual school system there was to draw a. line down the middle

3

of the county and all of the children in the eastern end of

4

the county would attend the New Kent School, and all of the

5

children in the western end of the county would attend the

6

WafcRins School.
Now, this, we say, was a -- not necessarily a pro­

7

3

nouncement, but certainly a suggestion by this Court that a

9

child be assigned or be allowed to attend, not on the basis of ,

10

race but be allowed to attend a school nearest his home.

ii

we say that this is exactly what the statute does.

12

statute does not allow any assignments, as this Court pro­

13

hibited, on the basis of race.

14

lowed to go to the school nearest their home, and we think

this is the only reasonable way that this Court can approach

the facts now before it.

Well, Judge McMillan -- no, it does not --

Judge McMillan's finding -was that they could establish the

needs on the basis of actual practice with the buses that

19

were available free of charge from the State Board of Educa­

tion,

But they would have to buy them next year.

21

What one roust understand, in relation to that, is

22

that the school board -- Judge McMillan's findings are based

23

on what they need to do, but It has always been - in the school

24

board's interest to exaggerate this and to devise routes

25

12

Q

Mr. Nafcrit, let me try this question out on

you. • This .statute that you challenge here today has been

14

adopted by the state on its admission to the Union and en­

15

force strictly from the beginning right down to the present

56

time.

17

Would you have a quarrel with it?
A

If I leave out the whole history of state

18

racial discrimination against the blacks in the country or in

19

the state —

20

Q

1 said "and enforced it."

If the state had

21

adopted it and enforced it* there wouldn't have been any

22

segregation* would there?

23

A

If the states had been colorblind from the be­

24

ginning and we never had slavery and we never had -racial

25

segregation* then I -wouldn't be here.

Then this statute would be all right, wouldn' t

If a statute 200 years old was strictly en­

2

forced right from the beginning.
A

6

That's right*

But the essence of ray submission

7

is to look at this statute as it exists in the world we know,

8

the world where the states have done everything they can, in­

9

cluding the sdhool boards and they have resisted Judge

10

McMillan4s orders in every way they know howt to keep racial

it

Mr. Justice -»

I don't describe my position that way, no,

of what Judge McMillan was faced with.

something that

Let's look at an example
He is faced with

you yesterday* we have just simply made tracings of a proposal

about how you treat the pupils in a particular area* and the

area* and the black outline is the one Judge McMillan ordered*

and let me take it very specifically* in an effort to show

you* not that there is something particularly wrong with ~~
60

1

not that somebody made a mistake about this particular thing,

2

but an effort to illustrate the principle that there really is

3

no difference between this racial balance idea that we are

4

chartered with and the neighborhood school idea that the

5

others say they assert.

6

G

7

You wonIdn41 show the neighborhood school

outline that some parties would be urging, would you?

8

A

This is the HEW neighborhood school --

9

Q

1 Know, but there are parties in the case who

10

say that that is a gerrymandered district -=•

11

A

Oh, yes.

12

Q

--a racially gerrymandered district,

13

and

they object to it on that basis.

14

A

1 am saying --

15

Q

So 2 arn not sure you

should suggestthat that

16

is the neighborhood school system that some people are talk*»

17

ing about.

IS

A

I agree with that, Mr. Justice White.

19

Q

All right, go ahead,

20

A

I will call it the HEW neighborhood plan.

21

Here is whsfc it does, the one that the Solicitor General sup­

22

ports.

23

pointing to that is called Lincoln High School.

24

a white school here called Deryder, and there is a white school

25

here called Statesville Road, cind all three of them have

There is a black school here down at this part 1 am

61

And there is

1

grades one through six, last year.

2

The school board constructed some zone lines to

3

-*» in their proposed integration plan* and it left Lincoln

4

High 100 percent black.

So HEW proposes to cure that by comI

5

billing all three into one big school sons,, combining all three ;

6

into one big school zone, and saying that the children in the

7

first two grades will go to Deryder over here* children in

8

grades three and four will go to Statesville Road, and the

0

children in grades five and six* even those white children

10

who live way out here, will go to the black school in the

11

ghetto in grades five and six.
Now, that is defended as neighborhood schools, and

this is a particularly large -- not a compact example of this,

Let me be clear, this is very much representa­

But it

if we had ever seen in any

16

of these cases the real neighborhood system, based on every

school,, then we might say that the judgment of the court is

^hey have never had that in Mobile.
You don'-’t. have any schools, any people that

It certainly happens that sometimes pupils

attend the closest school» but these city school systems are

25

not operated on any kind of basis of strict proximity.
65

Where

1

1 would like to ask you this question now,

There were no findings

made whatever as to

the history of racial segregation in schools up to 1954«,

practices have been racial ever since Brown.

23

Q

.school assignment

Well, 1 am just wondering if you are not talcing

on a little more baggage than you have to,
A

Your observation is entirely correct that

24

that is not essential, to Judge McMillan's decision, and we

25

don't believe it is so, because the school assignment practices,
66

1

the. dual zones of using buses to Keep the schools segregated^

2

busing

3

segregated„ all of those practices -« Mr. Justice Black,

4

there is an exhibit in the opinion by Judge McMillan, at

5

page 1206a of this third volume of 281, which lists the nine

6

schools that the school board would leave all black, and all

1

of them but one were either built since Brown or had additions

8

put on them since Brown, enlarged or improved.

9

children past their nearest school to keep them

So what we are looking at is institutions con­

10

structed on, an all-black segregated basis since Brown, and

11

Judge McMillan is dealing with the reality of life in a com­

!£

munity where the school board has been engaging in all of

13

the chicanery to keep the schools segregated, and it is his

14

job to find a remedy for that,, and we suggest that the only

15

adminisfcrable principle ie not some -- you will never get

16

these schools integrated if you tell the district judges to

\1

go develop reasonable plans or operate on one of these

18

verbal formulations that is based on something other than

19

doing the job.

20

Q

Well, if you can show us from any of these

21

particular things where the order has been approved which

22

shows in the record that it is discrimination against a race,

23

then I will be interested in it.

24

wholesale method of trying to condemn a whole practice and

25

society* at least it is traditional, of the neighborhood school

2

idea*
A

3

Wfell, Judge McMillan proceeded in precisely
‘

4

that Kind of common lav/ tradition.

He said he was deciding

5

this case on its facts and on Charlotte* and he wasn't trying
.

6

to make law for the whole country* he was trying the case on

7

the record before him.

It is a detailed record.

It is the*
I]

8

I am sure, most detailed record on the subject of busing in

9

relation to school desegregation that has ever been made.

10

And the suggestion that we ought to have a remand for some

11

further /proceedings, it seems to me,, is a suggestion that not

12

that the court clarify the law for the guidance of the school

13

board but a suggestion that we have E?ore confusion and more

14

lack of clarity.

i

16

Do you consider that Judge McMillan's findings

with reference to de jure segregation arising out. of racial

17

prevalence, zoning -- I am not speaking now of school zoning --

18

zoning ordinances and regulations is essential to his conclu­

10

sions ?

Ho* t thought I answered --

Why did you -~

22

A

It is not —

23

G

I should think your answer could be consistent.

24

Why did you offer evidence on the subject and why did he make

25

findings on it if it is irrelevant-?
68

1

A

Well, It is because the court's traditional

2

approach to these problems in state actions is to look at the

3

whole factual pattern and all the background pattern, and we

4

don't rely on any one factor and we certainly don't rely on

5

any one novel state action approach, so you have got all this

6

conventional state action., namely schools run on a compulsory

7

segregated, basis right up until July 1969e this school system

8

ran with 25 black schools, two-thirds of the children on a

9

freedom to transfer plan, just like that in the Monroe caseB

10
11
12
13

from Jackson, Tennessee, that was a companion of Green.
So there is so much conventional state action we
don’t have to deal with ~~Q

You are still ©n the Chief Justice°s question.

14

I understood that this post-1954 state action evidence was

15

introduced and considered by Judge McMillan as bearim upon

16

the question of whether these schools was in the context of

\

17

original, an original dual system, could still be regarded as

racially identifiable.

Certainly he thought it had some bearing'on

the matter, and X think that is correct.

2?

it is correct to say that the decision hinges on it or that

22

it depends on it.

But I do not believe

23

G

Well, that was the question X put to you first.

24

If I may take an example of the relevance ©f

25

this kind of evidence in a concrete way, the two schools that

AFTERNOON SESSION

2

2 i 00 p.m.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*.

4

Mr. NabrIt, you may

proceed.
MR* NABRIT:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6

the Court, I would like to use an additional ten minutes, If

7

the Court would allow.

8

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

9

MR. NABRIT:

Vary well.

Merely to state two additional argu­

10

ments which are made in our 'brief and in the process, 1 think,

11

add to my answer to the Chief Justice’s question which suppose

12

that this statute was adopted in an entirely neutral atmos­

13

phere, perhaps hundreds of years ago outside any content of

14

a history of segregation and s© forth.

15

The first of the two arguments is the one we set

16

out in our brief arid which the court below relied on, based

17

on the supremacy clause.

18

not apply to this hypothetical statute adopted in another en­

19

vironment.

Now, that argument, of course, would

The second argument 1 will make is based on the

20

21

principle decided in Hunter vs. Erickson and the lucid opinion

22

by Judge Paul Hays last week involving the New York statute»

23

might apply in that other situation, and then I will talk

24

about that.

25

And 2 would like to conclude by returning to what
71

i
i

3

we mean hy the racially identifiable school,
Now® the supremacy clause issue is, I think, quite

2
3

simple and quite fundamental.

4

stitutes a practical interference with the remedial powers of

5

the district judge.

6

It is that the statute con­

EVen if we accept Mr. Waggoner’s interpretation of

j

7

what the statute means, that is true.

8

the statute only applies after you have a unitary system, and

j

9

then when you do you can no longer use race and that the

Mr, Waggoner says that

30

statute forbids or prohibits the school board from using race

13

.to go beyond the requirements of Brown.

12

requirements of Brown but not beyond.

You can qo up to the

Mow, practically what does that do?

13

What did it

14

do in this case?

15

having a federal judge who would enjoin them, to come up to

16

the requirements of Brown, to do at least the minimum neces­

17

sary to comply with Brown, and a state judge who would enjoin

18

them, that you can’t take one step beyond it, that you can g®

19

one inch beyond the minimum federal constitutional require­

20

ments.

21

it put the school board in the position of

Mow, the statute is ©ver~br©ad in general and

22

vague, as this one. is, which sets up that kind of c©11is3ion

23

between the federal power and the state judge's power is a

24

practical interference with the remedial powers of the federal

25

court, the courts below, and the same thing is found in an
72

1

Alabama case, which we have reprinted in the rear, on 29a, of

2

the; brief for Appellees, a 1970 Alabama statute which the

3

three-judge court in Alabama, Judges Gewin, Thomas and

4

Pittman, held unconstitutional on the same grounds that the

5

legislature was trying to overturn the decisions of the

6

federal court and under the supremacy — on a constitutional

7

matter, they were trying to review the federal court8s de­

3

cisions about constitutional rights in this case called

8

Alabama vs. the United States, and that the law was unconsti­

!

I

I.
i

10

tutional under the supremacy clause as well as under the

n

Green casep and the Brown case.

12

Now, by making that argument on Mr. Waggoner's

13

assumption that the statute is neutral, I don^t mean to

14

gest for a moment that we accept that interpretation of the

15

statute.

IS

North Carolina urged in the court below and the three-judge

17

court accepted, in that the statute was intended to prohibit

18

school boards from using these ordinary techniques of school

IS

administration, such as busing, pairing, clustering and re­

20

scuing, any of them, if the purpose was to affect any racial

21

ratio cn the basis of race, any kind of racial balance.

suq-

The real meaning is the one the Attorney General ©f

22

Q

It says what?

23

A

Well, the words of the statute, the second

24

clause of that first sentence we were talking about in this

25

E^orth Carolina statute, is what 1 refer to, Mr. Justice Black.
73

!

1

It ia page 21 of our brief arid ifc is that nSto student shall be

2

assigned or compelled to attend any school on account of race,

3

creed„ color or national origin*"

4

talked about,, and it says "or for the purpose of creating a

5

balance or ratio of race* religion or national origins."

6

was understood ~~ this is what the Attorney General and the

7

court below accepted as embodying this limitation on the power

8

of the court to reorganise the system, and this is what is in­

9

volved.

That was the clause we

r

Ifc

'

How, the Hunter vs. Erickson point 1 do not intend

10
11

to argue at any length but merely to state.

The point is

12

simply this, that the statute does make an expressly racial

13

classification.

14

example, bus children in order to racially balance schools,,

15

but you can bus them for any other purpose.

16

children to segregate them by sex, you can bus them any dis­

17

tance, any age, for any other reason the school beard might

18

want to use, to save money, to build the schools out -- and

19

this is realistic -- to build the schools out where the land

20

is cheap* or any 6£ these kinds of reasons you can bus.

The

21

only reason you can’t use is busing for racial balance.

And

22

Hays* opinion doesn't presuppose any duty to integrate, even

23

if as he assumed there was no duty to racially balance aa a

24

constitutional matter,

25

the school board from doing something that the black community

It says to a. school board,, you cannot, for

You can bus

i

nevertheless, the statute disables

74

1

is interested in getting, namely advancing the cause of racial

2

integration in the schools.
Now, finally, our definition of the school board's

3
4

duty under the Constitution does not rest on a notion that

5

racial balance is required.

S

that the court ought to adopt very precisely in our brief in

7

the Mobile case.

e

adopted it in the Swarm case.

tffe state our view of the rule

As the Solicitor -General pointed out, we have

9

It is that every black child is to be free from as­

10

signment to a black school and an identifiable racial minority

11

school at every grade of his education» and we define identi.

12

fiable racial minority school not in terms of- mathematical

13

percentages or any .precise notion of a balance, tout in these

14

ttitemss
The racially identifiable black schools are those

15
IS

which by reason of a very considerable disproportion or a

17

very considerable racial concentration are conceived as de­

18

signed to receive black children.

19

aside for the black children is what we are talking about.

20

And the definition doesn't rest on anything like your mathe­

21

matical position.

22

ratios would satisfy the definition of a school not identified

23

racially.

The schools that are Set

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
minutes. Counsel.

21

MR. BLAKENEY:

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

23

I think you have 13

Thank you, sir.
If you find you need a

little more, we can give you some more.

24

MR, BLAKENEY:

I don't believe I will.

25

I would like to address my observations at this

0

1

time* if I may. Your Honors, to what seems to me to have

2

emerged as the main focus of contention, and that is this
matter of remedy, remedial action to cure or correct undue or

4

dismantle a situation caused by, let us assume for the moment,

S

caused by wrongful governmental action in the past, or indeed

6

wrongful governmental action presently existing.

7

And may I take as my point of departure the ques­

8

tion that the Chief Justice asked Mr. Naforit earlier to this

9

effect, whether he was arguing under Mr. Justice Black's

10

questioning about the constitutionality of the statute on

11

its terms.

12

are you contending that that wording is unconstitutional in

13

itself or are you contending that it won't due, it is invalid,

14

it is unconstitutional in its application to this factual

15

situation?
And 1 understood Mr. Habrit to reply it is the

16

17
18

The Chief Justice put the question to Mr. Habrifc,

latter.
How, I make bold to take the position, this

19

position. Your Honors, X cannot conceive of any situation, no

20

matter what the presence of governmental action in the past

21

or in the present may be, in which any remedy can be utilized

22

to redress a past constitutional wrong by imposing a new con­

23

stitutional wrong upon anybody who objects.

24

How, I stand upon that and 1 think that is con­
stitutional gospel,

but'let me develop that just a little
77

1

more, if I may.

2

2 say that on the question of determining whether

3

or not there is or has been governmental action that is caus­

4

ing, producing a situation of compelled segregation, that is

S

the-: true issue to be litigated in this respect:

6

found *•«• and this is essentially what I argued earlier — if

7

it can be found through careful litigation in any ease that

8

freedom is not being truly accorded now to the child, then

9

whatever it takes to remove that governmental action that is

\

If it can be

10

denying that child that true freedom today -** by true freedom,

11

1 mean freedom to go t© school on non-racial basis, without

12

regard to his color, without consideration of his race ~~ if

13

that freedom is not being truly accorded to biro, then that is

14

what the litigation should be about in each and every ease as

'35

it arises, and they will of course arise still, no matter what

18

the decision here is.

17

But that should be the inquiry and the result

18

should be to root that out, as has been said by this Court.

19

That freedom genuinely must be accorded*

20

it is not the course to fake to say to him, we will now put you

21

back on the road of racial compulsion, rather see that he gets

22

freedom, individual freedom.

23

But, Your Honors,

How, let me give an illustration to indicate further

24

what 1 am speaking of.

Shall it be said t© a Negro child, for

25

example, today at a given school, the Negro child,
73

i

let us say,

1

Is attending a school that is convenient to his. heme and that

z

he prefers fc© go there, his parents prefer him t© g© there,

3

they say so, they say so-in the Moore case, this is where.he

4

wants to attend»

5

to that child and say, beeuase your parents were by law ar

6

governmental action forced to go here, now therefore you are

7

going to be forced to leave here for that

8

racial compulsion that was imposed upon them, we now will im­

9

pose a racial compulsion upon you to go somewhere else, though

Shall school authorities toe allowed to go

because of that

'A*.- -•

10

you do not wish to go.

11

that: we now take you and move you,.

12

And it is only because of your race

Or to the white child, shall governmental authori­

13

ties say to him today, because your parents attended this

14

school, let us say,, in the past, in the neighborhood of your

15

home, and at that time negro children were not allowed to come

16

here, by law they weren^t, therefore, you the white child

17

must now leave here and go to another school you d© not wish

18

to at tend *

19

white.

And we send you away from here because you are

There must be retribution effected -here for what

20

*

21

was.

Or let us bring it t© the present.

22

matter of retribution for the past but here is a condition of

23

separateness existing today, we must correct this separateness

24

and therefore we must force you against your will and we will

25

.
^
pxck you by your color and send you.

is government compelling people,, driving people on the basis

of race.

Q

It

Take a ease where there has been no dual

5

system, no discrimination, but it just so happens that there

6

are some white schools and seme black schools in the city, by

7

whatever circumstances causes it, there are black schools and

8

white schools, and some black and white schools, and the

9

school board says to itself, we think we will have a better

10

educational result right across the board, people will come

11

out better citizens if they are educated better, so we are

12

going to pair some schools and we are going to make sure that

13

all through all the grades education is furnished to blacks

14

and whites together rather than separately, not because we are

required to, not because there is any — not because we have

to give a remedy for anything.
