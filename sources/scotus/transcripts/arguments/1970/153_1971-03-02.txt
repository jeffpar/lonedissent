ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF

8
3

MR. PREEFER; Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court.

10

Xhis is a tax*—*

11

Q

I should comment to you as we indicated before

12

we ppsned this morning, that Mr. Justice Marshall is unavoidably

13

absent due to illness, and he will make whis own decision as

14

to the participation and if he does then participate, it will

15

be on the basis of all of the usual papers and on the tape recor­

m

ding of the argument, of course.

17

A

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, Counsel will-—-

13

Q

I understand that's entirely agreeable.

19

A

Yes«,

20

This is a taxpayers suit challenging both the inter­

21

pretation and secondarily, the constitutionality of Title I

22

of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963.

23

The statute provides for grants of federal funds to

24

construct what are called "academic facilities" that are under­

25

graduate educational institutions. They're post-secondary level.

And as far as is relevant to this case idddefined

1

2

academic facilities amont others to exclude those used for

3

sectarian instruction or religious worship, or any

4

school which is part of a school or department of divinity.
Other than that it does not contain any express

5
6

exclusion predicated upon the nature of the beneficiary insti­

7

tution. The question

8

it, first, is not, although that appears to be how all appellees

9

seek to frame it, is not whether church related colleges are

TO

as presented by this appeal, as we see

disqualified from participating in the benefit of the statute.
If it were, that was the question, we would not be

11
'12

here, we conceed, and have never contended to the contrary,

13

that the mare fact that a college is church related does not

14
'15

either statutorily or constitutionally disqualify it from
.relieving federal funds.
The question as we see it, 'is whether a sectarian

IS
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

institution is disqualified both statutorily and constitution­
ally.
Now we have defined in our complaint, in our brief,
what we mean by sectarian. And specifically we call it one
in which the provocation teaching, or practice of religion

is

a meaningful and major part of its existence.
Q

Where is that written down in your brief?

A

Well the latest is in reply brief. I'm reading

from reply brief, page 3.

5

1

Q

All right»

2

A

This? well, it's in our original brief, as

3

wall. But I’m reading now from the reply brief, it's in the

4

original brief as well.
The provocation, or practice of religion is a mean­

5

6

ingful and major part of its existence.

7

This case was brought; before this Court decided

8

Walz against Tax Commissioners of New York. Had this case

9

been brought after that decision perhaps we would have defined

10

sectarianin terms of the Courts decision in Wals as one whose

II

dominant policy is to assure future adherence to a particular

12

faith by having control of their total education at an early

13

age. That’s in the Walz case.
Now—

14

15
16
17
18

20
21

22
23

25

What do you mean by the word ---?

A

Well—

Q

Are you suggesting that the two definitions

are synonomous?

19

24

Q

wiser

A

Basically, 1 guess—

Q

Or that one is preferable to the other—

A

No—

Q

Or that—

A

Well, they?re preferable in the sense that it’s

to use -the language of a. recent decision of the Court

than to use your own language. But basically I don’t consider
6

1

ny substantial difference between-j.

2

Q

So that they are basically synonoraous.

3

A

They're basically synonomous, yes»

4

Now——

5

Q

Welly Mr. Pfeffer, isn't a meaningful and major

6

aft of its existence a little different from control of

1

otal education at an early age?

3
9

A

Well, total education, as

I understand it, total

ducation in Wals in the context and I think what it raeanE

30

as that instead of assuring adherence to a faith by teaching

11

hem only religion, and a lot of them go to a secular institution

i2

for a secular education, it's a total education so that it

13

aas, as it were, total control of both the secular and the

14

religious aspects, that's how I interpret total education, and

'15

I believe that's what the was the intent of——

16

Q

We're not talking about — how many church re­

n

lated are Roman, Catholic parochial schools? There are Lutheran,

18

there are Jewish, % suppose both Reformed and -- Orthodox,

19

arent' there?

20

A

How many are there?

21

Q

Church related parochial schools. How many dif­

22
23

ferent faiths?
A

How many different faiths have parochial schools,

24

:>r how many faiths have church .related institutions? Which are

25

completely different.

7

1

Q

Nothat have paxoehial schools.

2

A

Well, the major ones, as I know, the major

3

ones are the Jewish, the Lutheran, the Seventh Day Adventist,

4

and of course, the Roman Catholics.' Those are the majors, there

5

are some Episcopalians---

8

7

Q

Now under your definition all 4 of them would

be sectarian?

8

A

9

erises an institution,

10

I have no definition which necessarily charact­
as sectarian or merely church related,

simply on the basis of a faith to which it has a relationship,,

11

There are many , many institutions which-—

12.

Q

Well, let me put it this way. Has any one of

13

those 4, can it be said that the propagation, practice, or

14

teaching of a religion is not a meaningful and major part

15

of the existence of a parochial school?
A

18
17

If we use the term sectatian, no.

18
19
20
21

I think so. If we use the term church related.

Q

I'm frying to get at this through your defin­

A

Oh,. If it's not a meaningful or major, then

ti tion.

it's not sectarian.

22

Q

Well does any of the 4 that you named-—

23

A

Well there are-—

24

Q

Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Jewish, and what vias

25

the 4th, Seventh Day Adventist?

Yes, sir» But there are some of those in which

A

1
2

the relationship to the church is so tenuous, it33 a vestige

3

of a. nations history.

4

Q

You mean by that that some particular, l®t0s say

5

a college identified perhaps with a Roman Catholic order,

6

may, in its particular circumstantes not be. sectarian-—" „

7

A

Yes, indeed. Yes; indeed, the mere fact that

8

it is Catholic does not mean it must be sectarian. And there

9

are Catholic institutions—-

10

11

Q

Can you think of any Roman Catholic elementary

schools that would not be sectarian?

12

A

Well, I---

1.3

Q

in—-

14

A

Well, I, offhand

15

Q

Can youthink

16

A

I can't. 1 can think of Episcopalians, I can

think of Unitarians.

19

20

of anyLutheranelementary

schools that-—

17

!8

I can't think of any,but——

Q

Let's hold it to your 4 for a moment. Can you

think of any Jewish elementary schools as to which--A

21

yes, I think it's quite possible. For example,

22

let me give you an example what are known as Sholem Alechem

23

schools which are secular schools. They do not have a religious

24

context.

25

Q

There are no islercentary schools —- .
9

\

2

A

As in response to Mr. Justice Brenaans inquiry.

3

4

No. At this poiftfc we're talkingabout colleges.

Q

Well let me finish. How about any elementary

schools in the Seventh Day Adventist?

5

A

My knowledge is that they would all be deemed

6

sectarian. I think there are Episcopalians that would not.

7

\nd certainly ethical culture which would---

8

Q

Are there some Baptist-—

0

A

Pardon?

IQ

Q

Baptist?

1!

8

Baptists prefer to have very little purpose,

12

because they don't use—~

13

Q

How about Methodists?

14

A

I don’t think they

have parochial schools. Now

15

the reason we have used the term sectarian in this brief and

16

In our proceedure because that9 a a term which has a long history

17

Dehind it.
Thirty three of the fifty states of the Union use

18
19

the term sectarian and none of them uses the term church rel­

20

ated .

21

And indeed the statuta which is at issue here uses

22

:he term sectarian. It does not use the word church, related.

23

:fow the posture of this controversy, by reason of the fact

24

that

25

re present.

the Court below did not pass upon the basic issue which
We had a trial in which we sought to present evidence

10

!

in respect to 4 institutions in Connecticut * all Catholic#

2

to show primarily to present# to create a record as to what

3

might be deemed sectarian and what might wot be.

4

We had precedent for that in state Court in Maryland

5

just 2 or 3 years agoc There ware 4 institutions which were

6

challenged under similar statute. Court haId 3 of them sec­

7

tarian# one of them said the relationship of that fourth

8

institution to a faith or a religion was sc tangential that

g

it could not be deemed sectarian.

'10

But the Court took the position—

11

Q

12

Tell me# did the Maryland Court ofAppeals

adopt your definition of a sectarian in that case?
A

13

Basically. The Court below took the posi­

14

tion that under the statute# and this was a decision urged

15

by the government# arid this is the ©position# this is the

16

interpretation thatthe Commissloner has applied throughout the

17

nation.

18

That it is completely irrelevant as to what the bene­

19

ficiary institution --

20

purpose is# what its practice is. The sole test# both as to

21

meaning and as to constitutionality is whether the particular

22

facility to which the federal funds are earmarked whether that

23
24
25

. What it was created for# what it’s

particular facility is not used either for sectarian instruction#
or religious worship.
If that facility# an island of sscularity# so to speak#

11

t

surrounded by a sea of sectarianism, is clear of religion , fcher,

2

it matters not what the sea is,

3

found in finding the facts, the only finding of the facts it

4

made was fchfefc we presented no evidence, in fact we do not contend

3

we did not contest the fact that in these 4 institutions, the

6

"facilities which were financed, in part, with federal funds

7

were not used for religious instruction or worship, indeed, the

3

evidence showed there were no crmsifices there, no religous

9

images, that they were completely secular.

'and there fore the Court

And the Court below adopted the goverments position

10

n

and simply

12

the evidence presented as to the nature of these institutions.

^3

disregarded and felt it, deemed irrelevant all

NOw, on the basis of that, the Court in effect held

u

this: that this is a fair conclusion, I believe,

15

Court has held and what the government contends that it is

IS

perfectly constitutional for the government to appropriate

17

funds for building facilities, and I want to interrupt for

13

one moment.

19

of what the

The term facilities has beers interpreted by the

20

Commissioner quite broadly. It does not mean necessarily a

2!

building, a library or a chemistry laboratory in a building,

22

the rest of the building which is committed to the devotion of

23

religious teaching so long as that library is not used for that

24

purpose, that library can be financed.

25

Now, an institution which admits only students of a
12

1

particular religion requires them to participate in religious

2

activities , compel Is them to comply with the doctrines of the

3

religion, forces them to attend church, requires them under

4

penalty of dismissal to take instruction in the theology and

S

doctrines of that religion, and does everything to proprogate

6

and advance a particular religion, other than confer degrees in

7

divinity, that such an institution can constitutionally re™

8

cieve governmental funds, so long as in its bookkeeping, it

9

allocates those funds to the construction of a chemistry’ lab-

10

oratoy, or a biology classroom*
This is the crux of the Courts decision., I cannot

II
12

see how the Constitution of the United States, which forbids

13

a religious test for public office, nevertheless permits the

14

financing of public facilities which apply to anybody b^t mem­

15

bers

of a particular religion.

16

This, yet, is what the governments position—

17

Q

18
19

Does the record show, in this case, whether

the Catholic schools in Connecticut admit only Catholics?
A

Well, we believe that such a finding could

20

have been made by the Court. Among them, the institutions, more

21

than 95% of these students are Catholic.

22

We do not contend, necessarily, that any one of these

23

institutions

24

that they cb not.

25

fs this description, but we do noot conceed

We are unable to deaw conclusions because the Court
13

1

below made no relevant findings; of the fact. It says its all

2

irrelevant,, We don't care how riany students there are. We don't

3

care if the .students are required to take theology. We don't

4

care if they're all Catholic. So long as the money is allocated

5

to that part of the institution from which religion is excluded

6

this is within the purpose of the statute and the Constitution.

7
8

Q

Does the record itself in this case

answer the question I asked?

9

A

I think

'50

Q

What does it show?

11

A

so.

It shows at least one of the institutions

12

has

over 95% Catholic. It shows that it advertises in

13

primarily Catholic periodicals,.

14

It 5isks—“

15

Q

But your general statement was at the be­

16

ginning,, that these institutions at least, would not admit

17

anybody

except from this denomination.

18

A

I'm sorry, I don't

think I said that.

19

Q

Well, then I misunderstood

20

A

you.

I said the Court eauld have so found that

21

at least one of them, it could have so found. It made no

22

findings. It could have so found. Had it so found, I believe

23

such a fsindin

24

the record.

25

'--ould have been supported by the evidence

in

But we don't know whet the Court found. 'She Court said

14

?

it doesn't make any difference.

2

And the lower Court, these 4 institutions are really

3

not the important things in this case. We brought them in only

4

to create a record. To provide specificity to use the language;

5

in Flast against Cohen of this Court.
But the Commission who is the real defendant in

6
7

•this case is applying this law nationwide. We'd be perfectly

3

willing to drop the suit against these 4 defendants, we have

9

no desire to recoup any of the money they have gotten.
We are seeking an adjudication which will

10

be a

15

party t o the Commissioner of Education, in carrying out the

12

functions and duties and obligations under this Act.
Now we claim that first our argument is that it is

13
14

not necessary for this Court to reach the constitutional

13

issue. We believe that the statute can be reasonably read

16

to limit it to such institutions which are not sectarian in

17

the sense which we have indicated. And in the sense which has

18

been used in the State Courts i.n interpreting their own '

19

statutes.
I Scty that there are 150 years of interpretation of

20
21

the word sectarian. We do not contend, we've never contended

22

that merely because an institution is church related is dis­

23

qualified or that Congress intended that is should be disqual­

24

25

ified.
Now, we think it is reasonable and under the well

15

}

f

established rules , the Court should seek, if it really would

2

do so, it could seek to interpret the statute in the context

3

which I suggest»

4

Certain far more acceptible, far more defensible,

5

or far more acceptible in interpretation, than, for example,

6

the interpretation of the Supreme Being in the (Saeger) ease.

7

Q

8

other premise, though?

9

10

A

The statute had been administered on the

Yes, indeed, it had been administered —.

Or else we would n't be in Court»

11

But leaving aside any. further discussion of consti­

12

tutionality which is inextricably wound up with constitutional­

13

ity, we claim that it is part of the Constitution of the United

14

States and of all the states of the Union that public funds

15

may not be used to

n

of a sectarian institution of the fcyp© which we describe»

19

System.

20

finance the: operation and construction

It was given its most perhaps broadest pronouncement

21

in the Everson case in 1947, in upholding bus transportation.

22

The Everson case which was a 5 - 4 split was meant nothing if

23

there were not agreement that you could not finance the oper­

24

ations of the institution itself. The Everson principle has

25 been criticized because it

the term no aid is too broad. This
16

1
2

Court in Weil3 also suggested it may have been too broad.
The Everson principle is not a no-aid principle. The

3

Everson principle is no-subsidy principle and the Court dis­

4

tinguished in Walz, it distinguished in (Allan) the textbook

S

case, between aiding an institution which the government does

0

many times, and subsidising it* financing it, that is what

7

we contend is -unconstitutional.

Mow, we have said, in our brief, and the government
takes exception to it, that v?e have been unable to find in

SO

the history of the United States, a precedence to

n

Education Facilities Act of 1963 for governmental financing of

12

the construction of a sectarian institution.

13

this Higher

The government says ever since their brief, ever

14

since the moral act, the

IS

ernment has financed church related institutions, we've said

16

sectarian, and gives as evidence for that, support for that

17

assertion, a study made by I presume the library of Congress,

18

which is called in the Congressional Record,

a little — to show how it's church related. I will read only

13

one; Kansas State University. To the naked eye I would assume

U

one would not suspect Kansas Stare University of being church

15

related.

16

}
But this government says it is. It reads as follows;

n

Kansas State University, Methodist Churgh gave

18

tral College to State as site for new agricultural college,

19

which was to reciever (Landgrandj

20

ricultural College becaipe the State University.

21
2,2

23

(Bluemcnt) Cen­

funds. The Kansas State Ag-

This is the whole part, ergo it follows that the
government has given money to a church related college.
I submit, Your Honors, if this prooves anything, it

24

preoved the opposite of what the government decided for. It

25

prcoved a recognition that (Bluemonfc) Collage so long a part of

18

the Methodist church could not reeleve government funds. So
what was done? A gift was made to a state university,, the
state of Kansas, the state of Kansas made it a public insti­
tution, and recieved funds.
This is, I submit, an argument which does not stand
strongly in this case. Now I recognise that the Everson
decision is a decision of discord. .And whcit this Court gives,
this Court can take away.
And if the Everson principle is dead, perhaps this
Court should say so. My argument is that the Court did not
say so. That notwithstanding the criticisms and it is legion.
There’s not a Law Review in the country which from
time to time does not have an article

showing how broad; the

Everson faictum is and criticising for overbreadth.
But the supreme judiciary body of the United States
is not the Law Reviews. It is not the briefs of

. It is

this Court, and I submit that this Court did not in any way
impair the integrity of the basic principle of Everson of no
financing of sectarian institutions.
Q

What do you say about the conclusion in

Everson, apart from the language'?
A

The conclusion is certainly cot a-—

Q

I mean the judgement.

A

The judgement said and indeed this is how

Everson is interpreted in every one of the cases, this statute

19

1

is constitutional because it does not subsidize the operations

2

of parochial schools.

3

constitutional —— it provides welfare with safety benefits.

4

The Court said it just deals with — . It's to protect the

E

children from the hazards of the road.

6

It does not, and the

It does not finance. This statute is

!

(Allan) textbook case, theCourf

7

said the same thing. This statute does not subsidize, does

8

not fincance the operations of the parochial schools.

9
50

Q

A

I guess the Court could say the same

It could say, I wonder how if could say

it, but of course--—

m
54

i

thing in these cases.

n

52

I

Q

If it could say so in (Allan) and if it

could say so in Everson, then it could say so in this---

13

A

It could say

but respectfully and with

16

a

17

say that financing a building which is part of an institution,

58

not financing an institution—

good deal less validity., I don’t know how the Court could

19

Q

i

How do youdistinguish a building, really,
I

20

from transportation facilities, as a tool of education?
i

25

A

Well, the answer is, Mr. Chief Justice, that
!

22

Everson was based on the fact that transportation was not

23

a tool, but the — claims that it was. The 4 Justices, Mr.

24

Justice

C lhitherh Mr. Justice Jackson asserted that it was.
But the — CoEirt said it is not, said it is a tool

3

ThatJs the premise of the Everson case, jit is how

it is interpreted. Now if theCourt, if the Court is prepared

5

to overrule Everson, I think it should do so in clear unam­

biguous language.

7

I should like to quote to the Court a short state­

8

ment from the treatise of Chief Justices. He saidf"in the Un­

9

ited Statea against {.garth) and opinion which is to overrule

10

all former precedents and to establish a principle never

11

before recognized should be expressed in plain and explicit

12

terms, A mere implication ought not to cause prospersfcrate

13

a principle which seems to havs been so wall established.

14

General expressions ought not to be considered as overruling

15

settled principles without direct declaration to that effect.'

IS

If this Court is prepared to correct a century and

17

a half of error, I s^tbrnit it should do so clearly and unam­

13

biguously. I submit further it has

19

case has this Court in any way impaired the integrity of the

20

basic principle of Everson, no financing or subsidy of the

21

operations or construction of a sectarian institution in this

22

sense that we are using that term.

not done so. In no

23

Q

Mr. Pfeffer-—

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

—some time, would you comment on the

21

1

Bradfield case--'

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

-“-particularly in the light of the fact

4

5

that it is not cited in the governments brief?
A

At this particular point. There is no

6

need to --- .

7

in which the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a contract be­

8

tween the city of Washington and a asorporatior formed by an

9

order of nuns to operate the Providence Hospital in the city

10

Brad-field against Roberts was ;Sn 1899 decision

of Washington.

II

The Court held the statute constitutional on two

12

basic concepts. Firsts that there is nothigg sectarian in

13

thfe operation of the hospital. This hospital, the Court said

14

is operating according to its charter, and it is a : hospital

15

which treats ill people. It does not teach, i&. does not

IS

propogate religion.

17

Within the term sectarian as 2've used it, they are

18

not a sectarian institution. The Court indicated that it's

19

a separate corporation, but 1 don't think that's a critical

20

factor, I think the

21

fraud, and I think the law would pierce the corporate veil

22

to prevent violation of the first amendment.

23

pierced the corporate veil ho present

But the critical factor is not whether this is a

24

legal fiction, e separate corporation, but when this is in

25

truth, and fact an institution which propogates and practices

22

1

religion» It does not» It propogates nothing and teaches med­

2

icina .

3

Secondly^ here’s another critical distinction» The

4

Court pointed out that no person is denied admission, and

5

treatment to that hospital because of the religion or faith»

6

It is not limited to members of that faith. It said, indeed,

7

it had to be, because as part of its contract with the city

8

of Washington, it had to take indigent patients»

9

Mow I submit to you, that a state cannot make a con­

10

tract, 'the federal government cannot make a contract with a

11

sectarian educational institution of the type I've described

12

whereby the state will pay that institution money and send

13

its students there».

14

It can do it with a hospital. But an institution has

15

the right to say indeed has a constitutional right to say

16

under the religions liberty clause, we will not admit anybody

17

here unless he's part of our faith and indeed if he is part

18

of our faith as hha record shews he must take Catholic fcheo-

19

logy, or Lutheran theology, must go to mass or to communion,

20

this is a condition which a sectarian institution has under

21

the free exercise clause an absolute right to make»

21

.

23
24
25

That was not involved in Bradfieid against Roberts.
Now if I am correct, that up to the present this Court
has not. impaired the integrity of the basis of Everson, I
submit that the fact that, the funds which are allocated are

23

t

earmarked for a particular facility which of itself is not

2

religion—

3

Q

1 take it from your discussion of Bradfield,

4

though, that the, since you say the separate corporation is

5

not vary important in the case, that the government may give

6

money to a church, a religious organization to carry on a non­

7

religious activity»

8

A

A welfare activity.

2

Q

A non-religious activity.

10

A

Well-

11

Q

Well that's what they did in Bradfield.

12

They gave money to the church to carry on a hospital. In which

1.3

hospital there were no religious activities.

14
15

A

That's not all. In which activity was avail

able to everybody.

16

Q

Well, I agree with that—

17

A

But that's part of the picture.

18

Q

I know, but nevertheless the government may

19

give money to a church to carry on non-religious activities.

20

A

Subject to certain other qualifications.

21

Q

So the answer is yes.

A

Yes, subject, to qualifications. Yes, to a

22
23
24
25

non-religious activity, but not one which is limited to the
members of that faith, or which has a religious bar or deter­
mination. And to who can get the benefit of those facilities.

24

Q

But would it have made any difference in

Bradfield if there had been a place for prayer and worship in
the hospital?
A

It would have? if every patient were re­

quired to go to prayer as they are in religious institutions»
It- would have made all the difference in the world» The re­
cord shows that Catholic participation in Catholic theology
courses is required»
Q

Would it have made any difference! in Brad-

field if as I think is the custom in Catholic hospitals, there
were a crucifix on the wall of each hospital room?
A

I don't think that would have been enough

to make a difference» I don•t think that would have been enough
to make a difference. I don't thank, if that’s all there
was, I don’t think that would have brought it into the frame­
work of a sectarian educational institution of the type
which I've discussed.
Q

Nor, that each nurse was a nun?

A

No, I think not.

Q

And that she was wearing—

A

No, I think not.

Q

Nor that the director of the hospital—

A

I don't think that would have made--

Q

Well, then, Mi1. Pfeffer, I suppose the

I thinly—

government had given the money to the church to carry on the
25

1

non religious

2

carried

3

4

activity e-yen though the church might have

it oa, anyway.
A

Welly I don’t see what the relevance of

whether the church would carry it on or not.

5

Q

Well,—

6

A

I would say yss.

7

Offhand I can't see how
!

I

that makes it constitutional—

S

Q

9

A
Q

10

Well if just saves the church money.
Oh, that I dcp't--But the bookkeeping really isn’t very

.

11

important.
!

12

A

It’s not the bookkeeping that’s, notvery

13

important, it’s the point that the bookkeeping

14

tant for -this reason. The bookkeeping is important that it's

15

not because it saves the church’s money, but because,

16

it's not important, I think it’s absolutely not important,

17

but not for the reason which you might be suggesting. It's

18

not important because the money is used, not to save the

19

church money, not the church might be a case of the church

20

has to go, indeed that they claim that they have to go out

21

of business unless they get the federal funds.

22

Qq

is impor­

indeed

Well Mr. Pfeffer, you certainly hav© to

23

eoncead that what happened in that case teas the subsidy of

24

a religious order operating a hospital, wasn’t it? It was

25

government subsidy with government money to operate an activity

26

i

of a religious order, to the hospital—

2

A

3

Justice—

4

Q

but wasn’t it that?

5

A

It was that, it was inore than that.

S

Q

It was a religious subsidy, wasn’t it?

7

A

It was a subsidy to operate a public service

It was not, again l9m I must go back, Mr»

8

available to all of the public without any requirements of

9

religion, without being—

10

Q

No matter how you parcel it, it was still

ii

a subsidy of a religious institution, wasn't It? To that

tz

extent?
A

13

It was not, I've never said that the

14

constitution forbids the subsidy of religious institutions.

15

I said, of an institution which is engaged in the propogation

16

and teaching of religion.

17

Q

well—-

18

A

This hospital is not engaged.

19

Q

Well isn't

20

A

But that the hospital.

21

Q

22

25

So you-re saying that yon may not subsidies

an activity which is a religious activity.

23
24

• the Catholic church?

A

Exactly. Ar. activity which is a religious

Q

Then the only question in this case is

27

!

whether the teaching of mathematics in a building is a rel­

2

igious activity or not»
A

3
4

The teaching of mathematics in a building

may be a. religious activity—
Q

S

Welly we haven*t reached that point, have

6

we? We've only reached the point whether the government, can

7

subsidise the construction of a building. We don't know

3

what it’s going to be for.
A

9

I say the government cannot subsidise the

10

construction of a building whether you call it religious or

n

not religiouso
Q

12
13

Then why can it subsidise the operation of

a hospital?
A

14

Because nobody was barred from entering

15

that hospital becuase of religion, I cannot get away from

16

that. This is the critical difference.
Q

17
18

21

22

A

25

It could, but it could not bar a non-mem-

ber of any particular religion because of religious-—And
I cannot see how the government can itself subsidize somebody
else to do what it cannot do.
Q

23
24

suppose the government could have

gone into the business of building hospitals on Its own—

19

20

Well I

Well suppose that the government would be

barred by the First Amendment from building a sectarian
school28

1
2

A

it would. Now if you take, Mr.

Justice Brennan, youtake your argument and carry it out—
Q

3
4

Indeed

I'm not making an argument, 13m amking

a statement.
A

5

I'm sorry, your suggestion. Seeking to meet

6

your question, suppose you have a church that does nothing

7

but prayer and worship and the government gives it money

8

to be used only for the construction of a new furnace? Because

9

the furnace is out of order and the church has no money.
So the government gives it money €o construct a

4

11

furnace room at that church. Is that constitutional?

12

Q

But that's not the case we have her®.

13

A

It is, indeed. The argument which we make

14

and the case which we make and the Court said- that even by

15

its decision even so, if the chemistry laboratory, if the

16

biology laboratory, if they're in order to make it possible

17

for a student oto get all of their education under religious

18

auspices, which is what the Court said in Walx, then this

19

chemistry lab is just as much part of the whole religious unit

2

as, ife the room used for teaching religion or prayer, Now

21

I must, inviview of the time, I mustgo, if you'll permit me,

22

to the Wal2 test, which is the latest voice of this Court, the

23

latest statement of this Court on what the establishment

24

casss-- .

25

The Walz-—
29

1
2

Q

This Connecticut case, was that decided

before we decided Walz?

3

A

Yes* indeed. Yes, indexed. I’m—

4

Q

I gather from your brief you!re suggesting

5

that we may have a different test in Wals than the purpose-

S

effect test we have in—

7

A

No, I’m 'not contending that at all. I’m

8

contending all tests, Everson, (Shimp)(Allan) and Wals are

9

basically—

10

Q

II

A

All the same?
-- all the same. Are basically all the same.

n

They are different formulations of what I’ve said to be a

is

hundred and fifty years of constitutional law of the United

u

States.
If there are going to be changes;, this Court will

15

16

have to make them. I am not challenging constitutional law.
Q

17
18
19

to draw a

I think — judicial opinions attempting
distinction between an exemption and — .

A

Yes, indeed. Waiz does this. And the

20

difference is that the exemption applies no surveyance, no en­

21

tanglement, subsidy does. And entanglement and surveyanee

22

here there is galore.

23

The Act provides that for 20 years a facility is used,

24

if at assy time in 20 years a. facility financed with federal

25

funds is used for sectarian worship or prayer, the institution

Anything.

S

Q

Even though the government paid for it.

7

A

Presumably. 18 m not saying that's consti­

this statute? The government

stitution for 20 lest religious teaching

18

ba —- itito a

This is survelance for 20 years. Moreover, in Everson,

16
17

must keep an eye on that in­

this Court ruled not only that it’s unconstitutional for a
public financed institution to teach the Genesis version

19

of the Creation, but it's unconstitutional not to teach the

20

Darwinian version, of the Creation, of evolution.
So that this Court, the United States will have

21

22
23
24
25

to police these colleges, make sure not only do they not
teach Genesis, or evolution or the Creation with point fco
Genesis, that they not teach the Creation with point to Dar­
win.

31

This is survalance of the most extreme kind. This
is the entanglement

of the state and religion of a type

which every decision of thes Court, going back to Watson
against Jones, .

1870, in every decision the Court said that

the government must keep oht of censuring, looking into
what's happening in the religious institution.
It’s done that in Russian Orthodox cases. It's done
it in the (Cattle) against Connecticut. It says, this we are
not to go into. The eclesi&stical or theological religious
institution and spy upon them or oversee them or entangle
ourselves in their activities.
1 cannot see

how ,under this statute, the government

to be faithful to its constitutional obligation because I'm
sure can see that the government may not finance a facility
which is used for religion—
Q

What is that form of survelance?

A

Well,---

Q

It lasts for 20 years.

A

Yes,--What form does it take?

A

Well according to what appeared from the

government, the government will probably be in a better positior
to answer this than I am, if they have any reason to believe
that there may be use of the premises for religion they in-'
specfc

it. And they can and do exercise control to make sure

32

1

that either that's discontinued or that appropriate counter­

2

measures are taken.
Now, I9m not privy tc how they administer it, IBm

S
4

saying that there is no way of avoiding it. There is no

5

avoiding the constitutional barrier or the statutory barrier,.
Q

6
7

which says you shall keep this survelance over 20 years?
A

8
9

Well is it an express statutory provision

Mo, the statute says if this facility is

used in violation

of this prevision as well as other pro­

10

visions , but I'm talking only about this provision, within

11

a 20 year period, that the institution Bust reimburse the gov­

12

ernment.

13
14

15

Q
is that set
A

Well, now the proceedure for survelance,
up by regulation, is that it?
I think the government would have to answer

16

that. But whether there cire or there aren't I think it's not

17

constitutional. If there arenfct it means only that the gov­

18

ernment is neglecting its constitutional statutory obligations.

19
20
25

22
23
24
25

The test is not whether it's doing it, the test is
whether it's required by
Q

’.the law of the constitution.

That's why I was asking you whether it was

required by the law™
A

Yes, indeed, they are required by law and

the constitution to uphold the statute and the constitution.
And this requires no other way. unless they take- the institutions.

33

i

2
3
4
5

Where if they don't at least they don't there is some
evidence to the contrary.
Q

And you say that the survelance adds to

the unconstitutionality——
A

Under the Walz test.

The title

. It

6

is not the only thing. There is far more than that* but this

7

is, it is our contention that no matter how you look at this

8

, it's unconstitutional.
'

9

The basic premise is a premise which is long establish©’

10

in constitutional law. The struggles which have bean had,

11

both this Court and the Law Review and the — of how to
.

12
13

formulate that.
But the heart and blood of it is that you cannot tax

14

the whole community to support a religious enterprise whose

15

purpose is to propogate and teach religion,. And who bars from

16

its facilities those who are not of the faith.

17

This to me is basic constitutional law, and I don't

18

think any test how ever formulate! can get away from a face

19

to face encounter with that basic proposition.

20

low, one word™—

21

Q

So fundamentally, I take it you just take

22

issue with the notion from the ground up that there if there

23

ismore than one activity going on in a sectarian school, that

24

everything that goes on in it is sectarian—

25

A

That's not the-- 1 didn’t say that.

34

Q

1

2

Well is there any secular education going

on?

3

A

In, surely»

4

Q

You think it’s inextricably intermingled

A

Absolutely» I'm saying that that, secular'—

5

with—-

6
7

under the --- test it doesn’t make any difference. Under the

8

entitlement case it makes no difference because it still re-

9

quires survelance to keep it that. Unless you wanfctfco overrule.
Q

10

Then you think it's irrelevant to some

n

schools that you would clasify as sectarian under your def­

12

inition, some school undertakes to live up to the conditions

13

to grant that you must nevertheless disregard the conditions

14

or to say it's unconstitutional for them to agree with those

15

conditions.
A

16

Yes, unless the Court wants to overrule

17

Ex?erson, wants to overrule WaXz, and I believe overrule Allan,

18

too.
Q

19

So I take it that you would agree that you

20

can subsidise a church, give money to a church to carry on

21

an activity, which activity itself is not aimed at propagating

22

a faith.

23
24
25

A

Yes, subject to a condition which I6ve re-

paated many times.
Q

Well, yes, well—

35

1

A

I can't get away from it because the mere

3

Q

We,f remember that.

4

A

The mere fact, it's more than that, it's

2

fact—

5

more than that. The mere fact that the institution is limited

6

to members of a faith, and the members of the faith are re­

7

quired to accept instirction which they are, in that faith,

8

as a condition to using that facility which is the key sweep,

9

indicates to me, sir, that that facility is a means not an

10

end.
It's there in order to make sure that

1!
12

who will take religion.
Q

13
14

we get kids

By the facility you mesa the institution,

not—

!

15

A

No,—

16

Q

Not the particular laboratory, though,
I

17

18
19
20

is it?
A

That's what 1 mean. Why does an institution

which is—
Q

I thought what we were dealing with here

21

was the construction of a building which was to be used as

22

a laboratory, for something, chemistry, has nothing whatever

23
24
25

to do with religious teaching. And you say that that's—
Q

It has nothing to do with religion, Mr.

Justice Brennan, if it's, anybody can go in there,,it's not

36

i

parto of the institution, it5 s not a means to achieve the end
of the institution. We cannot—
Q

Recently you may have noticed that opened

on the campus of Catholic University, is a theatre.
A

Yes.

Q.

The Harkness. He's its director, that's

open to the public. But if the government had built the
Harkness Theatre, since it's on the campus of Catholic Univar
sity, he's on thefaculty of Catholic University—
A

That's not enough—

Q

Would you—

A

Tnat is not enough for me to express an

opinion. In fact I don't have that here* and Xem not required
to express an opinion, that's net in any of these cases.
Q

Wouldn^t necessarily be invalid.

A

What?

Q

It wouldn't necessarily—

A

It would not necessarily but in order to

get into that theatre, you had to go first to a chapel, where
you got a sermon on religion,, and then we went to the theatre,
I would s,ay we have an. analogous case here.
That's what I would say, because that's exactly what
the government, and I say that is perfectly permisabhle.
Q

Mr. Pfeffer, suppose, against the back™

ground that we have in this country of a shortage of doctors.

37

1

probably a shortage of lawyers, the government embarked on a

2

grant program to grant to any school, any university, including

3

Georgetown, and Catholic University, grants for law schools,

4

and basis science, and medical schools, to be built on the

5

land owned by the University, and to revert to them as it

6

does here, in fee after 20 years. Would you, I'm not clear

7

from what you said now whether that would nor would not be

8

parmissahle, constitutional.
A

8

I will not say whether it would be per-

10

missable. I'll say under what conditions it would not be

n

permissable.

12

I think, because that, I think, is what is relevant,

13

hare. I am not required to spell out for the government what

u

it

15

the government may not do. It may not say you cannot go to

16

the law school unless you take theology, unless you participato

17

in mass, unless you are of the

18

eran religion—

19

isay do. We are here to try to convince the Court what

Q

Catholic religion, the Luth­

I should have included in ®y hypothesis

20

what I believe to be the fact that at Georgetown University

2!

you can go to the law school without going to any other school

22
23

or the chapel.
A

JEhen I say a very good case could be made

24

our for saying that as in the Maryland case that the relation­

25

ship of that institution to the church has reached a point

38

1
2

where it is no longer sectarian»
And indeed this is what is happening with many of

3

them; it's what happened with Yale, with Harvard, with Col"

4

umbia, with Princeton» They started out as sectarian insti­

5

tution. This is what happened with some •--- institutions»

6

They are going through the same proceedares, Fordham, Notre

7

Dame» I wouldn't be surprised that in 10 or 15 years, the

8

relationship

9

be somewhat analogous to the relationship with Columbia Univ­

10

between Notre Dame and the Catholic church will

ersity and the Episcopal, Church»
t

11

Or Princeton to the Presbyterian Church» All the

12

institutions, now many of the institutions are going through

13

the same development» And they reach a time, as with the

14

Court ofAppeals in Maryland, held when yea can say that this

15

is nolonger a sectarian institution.

i
16

The public school system of the United States went

17

through the same metamorphosis. It started out as Protestant

schools, as

19

that the state constitutions were written, provided that

20

they cannot be supported because of their Protestant, net their

Catholic church relationship, church sectarianism.

Q

Wellff Mr. Pfeffier, let's take these specific

2

institutions here, could the government include students who

3

want to go to these schools in a generally applicable scholar­

4

ship program?

7

I
!

A

In scholarship to students who could choose

any college that they want——
Q

I

That's a scholarship program based on finan­

8

cial need, but he can take his scholarship and go anywhere

9

he wants to.

10
11

A

If Your Honor please,

I would

like to exer­

cise my priveledge of not replying to a question which I
i

12

believe is not relevant to this case.
!

13

Q

14

A

Yes.

!

Because the issue is a difficult one and I

15

don't want to foreclose any possilie position which I can take

IS

sufficient time.

17

Q

Of course in that situation the government

13

would be furnishing the most critical element of religious

19

activity, namely, the people.

20
21

22

A

Well, then perhaps if that's so, theh I

would say assuming you'd say that, I'd say it's oonstitutional
-- but I'm not prepared at this point either to make any

23

claim or to defend it, I'm not required in the light of this

24

case, nothing in the Courts opinion below, nothing in the

25

position taken by the government.

40

1

Q

Weil I thought you read Allan as a part of

2

going on the ground that it wenttto the student instead of

3

the institution.,

4

A

I—

5

Q

don't I find that

in your briefs

8

A

I said that Allan

pressed that there was

7

no subsidy for the institution.
Q

8
9

Well, isn't that the same as saying it

went to the student instead of the
A

10

school?

No, there was no subsidy there involved.

11

The use of books was involved. Allan, as 1 interpret Allan,

12

is-—

13

Q

Do you think it might have been different

U

if the student had got the money to go to a bookstore and buy

15

the books? Do you think Allan would have come out then?

16

A

I'd rather not speculate.on what Allan was

17

decided. I would say it didn't decide that. What I think

18

Allan decided was this: that just as a Catholic child, or a

19

Lutheran child can go to a public library to borrow a book

20

which he needs to help him in his studies, he can, under this

21

statute get in from the state directly without going to the

22

public library.

23
24
25

But I do not interpret Allan to say that the fact
that this book is limited only to persons of a particular
religion will nevertheless make it constitutional.

ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. FRIEDMANs Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court.
The Higher Educational Facilities Act of 1963 rests
on findings by Congress that at that time there was an urgent
need for a tremendous expansion of the higher” educational fac-

42

I

Alities in the United States. .And in order to enable the

2

!

3

young people of this country to obtain an education which they
\
needed and which held out great promise, for the future, the

4

provision in Title I, for grants to educational institutions

i
i

5

only permits grants upon a determination that the grant will

i
i

6

result in the creation of urgently needed expansion of fac­

i

7

ilities which will increase the enrollment of the colleges.

i

go that the critical fact of this statute is that

8

it was designed in order to enable this country to expand its

9

i

10

higher educational facilities at a time when existing fac­

1!

ilities were inadequate.
Mow, the statute as Mr. Pfeffer has indicated is

12

13

very explicit that no federal grants may be made for any fac­

14

ility which is used for sectarian instruction, or sectarian

IS

worship. And in addition, no grant may be made for any facility

16

which is all or part of a school of divinity, and school of

17

divinity, in turn, is defined very broadly.

j

It's defined as a school for the education of students j

18
19

to prepare them to become ministers of religion, or to enter

20

upon some other religious vocation, or to prepare them to

21

teach theological subjects.
i

Q

22
28
24

Mow once a grant is made, fchoiigh, Mr. Fried­

man—-

A

Pardon?

Q

Mr. Pfeffer suggests that once a grant is

.

25

43

i

made, once you. gat over these hurdles,, if the institution

2

qualifies for a particular facility, then is the

3

arrangement?
A

Q

Well what is the statutory policing -- deals

A

There's no statutory provision for that. The

Let me say specifically what the — there

isno policing as we use the

6

policing

only statutory provision is that academic facilities cannot

10

be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious

11

worship.

i

Now, what the Office Of Education has done in this

12
13

area,

14

by the institutions, when they seek a grant. They are required

15

to certify that none of these facilities will be used for re­

16

ligious purposes. They are specifically instructed in several

17
18

i

purpose.

I

places on the application forms, that this is the limited

They do have some on site inspections. The on site'—-

22

i

is it relies primarily upon the representations made

19

21

II

Is this under some standard proceedure ,

regulations, or—
A

No, this is just iinder what I might call

informal prcceedures. They are informal proceedures. From time
to time,-—
Q

—regional setups throughout the country?

Ad

i

A

They have regional offices but they do

2

not have regional inspection proceedures„ The information

8

they have given me is that since the funds were, recieved

4

in 1965

5

3200 grants approximately half

that have now been completed.

7

3

there have been approximately 3200 grants. Of the
of 1600 resulted in facilities

And of 'the 1600 completed, there have been approxima­
tely 400 on site inspections.
But the nature of these facilities since these are

10

buildings, the nature of these facilities means that the

11

inspection, the kind of inspection is relativaly simple.

12

13
14

In other words, a look-see, look at the catalogue,
to see what courses if--Q

Wall, where did !-~did X read in one of

15

the briefs, there are so many briefs here I can't be sure,

16

that there had been an indident about some institution in

17

Mississippi—

18

A

There are shown in the record in a stipula­

19

tion, the page is 82 - 84, three instances where information

20

came to the attention of the Office of Education that 3 insti­

21

tutions apparently had been using some of their facilities for

22

religious purposes.

23

In 2 instances, the institution agreed to stop it,

24

in the third instance, Where they were using an assembly hall

25

for a chapel, the institution decided to return to the federal

4S

1

2

government the money it had recieved for the grant.
The federal government in these grants , £ think it

3

is self evident, does not pay the full, amount for the facility

4

It's only a porpprtionate amount.

5

6

Q

Now is it. so that at the; end of the per­

iod, 20 years, I think Mr. Pfeffer suggestssd, then the fee—

7

A

That is—

8

q

9

A

That's—

10

Q

It cauld beconverted

n

A

That's right.

---and I gather at that time, the assembly-

intoa—

Twentyyears,

I think, is

12

the regognifcion by Congress as that point at which the con­

13

nection is — „

14

One thing' I should say, however, that if during the

15

20 year period it is discovered that an impermissable use

16

is being made of one of these facilities, it does not necess­

17

arily automatically revert back to the government and they

18

do not necessarily have to refund the amount.

19

They have the priveledge of terminating the imper-

20

mi sable use, which is vzhafc happened in 2 Or 3 of these hypo­

21

thetical cases.

22

23
24
25

Q

What happens if they do not terminate?

A

If they do not terminate the use? Then they

are required under the statute to refund what they

have re­

cieved from the government, but it1s on a formula under which

46

they refund the relative value of what they got from the
government to the total cost of the facility on the basis of
the than value of the facility.
Q

Is that a statutory formula, or—

A

Yes, that is the statutory formula.

Q

Suppose they don't return it?

A

Well if they, I presume the government could

either- then bring a suit to—
Q

What happens to the building?

A

I suppose this would depend on what relief

the government seeks. The building might revert to the gov­
ernment.
Q

Does the statute provide that it does?

A

The statute is not explicit on that, the

statute merely states that if—
Q

You mean that it's not. clear on it.

A

It’s not clear on it. That's right. And

we're hopeful that no such cases will arise, this, at least
as of this time, there have been no instances where the gov­
ernment has had to resort to that, except for these 3 instan­
ces .
Now let me, since Mr. Pfeffer has been talking largely
about what I might call theoretical institutions, let me say
that as far as these 4 colleges

are concerned, the record in

this case is unequivocal^ that there has been no prohibited

4?

1

religious use of any of the facilities here, which was testi­

2

fied to without any question,, in the Appellants here introdu­

3

ced no evidence that there was no religious use made of any

4

of

5

no religious symbols in any of these buildings»

these buildings that there were: no religious plaques,

Q

6

Mr. Friedman, in these, what does the

7

evidence show about whether these institutions limit their

8

student

9

to one freligious faith?
A

The evidence is very explicit on that,

10

that they do not. There was again, uncontradicted testimony

11

by the heads of all of these institutions—

12

Q

But the Gout made no findings, on that?

13

A

Court made no findings.

14

Q

And it's implication was that it would n’t

15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

have made any
A
Q

difference.
Presumably
So we must consider this case as hough it

were a case involving an institution that did limit it's
enrollment?
A

I don't think, Mr.'

Justice, it would

necessarily raake any difference, but I don't think the Court
should consider it on that basis, but even though the Court,
theDistrict Court did not

raake any findings, we have this

record, and this record is uncontradicted, 1) that they did
not discriminate, that they do permit members of any faith

48

to attend the schools.

Q

So that what does the record show about

whether or not people who attend these institutions must
attend chapel?
A

The evidence is again uncontradicted that,

no non-Catholic is required to attend any religious service.
Q

A

what about Catholics?
Catholics it varies , I believe, in some,

the testimony was that in some of the institutions they are
not required to, and in soma they. ware.
Soma of the institutions™—
Q

at about the ones * where they require

some of the students, mainly Catholics to, as a condition
for participating in the secular education program, to attend
/

chapel and to take a course in ——
A

Well, Mr. Justice, I’d like to correct my

answer, on thinking back—Q

A

Yes.
—the testimony is, by the presidents

of these colleges that the

Catholic students are not

-required

to attend any religious services.
They say that Catholic doctrine may require them in
some circumstances to do so, but that that is a matter for
their own consciences.
Q

In other words, that’s independent of any

49

1

without

the compulsion of any school regulations—

2

A

3

Q

4

A

That's right,

5

Q

Wall how about a schoolthat

6

That's correcto
—“it's just a matter of faith involved»

does require,

Mr, Friedman, and some schools do, West Point, for example.

7

A*

Well

again, Mr.,

Justice, Iwouldn't

8

thinly that that would make any difference, because as I will

9

come to in a minute

„

under what we think is the appropriate

10

test, the question is you look to see the facilities being

11

subsidized.

12

Are they secular? Now as Mr. Justice Brennan has
i

13

|

suggested, West Point, they

14

!

Litigation now pending in the District of Columbia over the

15
16

validity at the Naval Academy.
But if I may say one ofchet thing

Mr. Justice White,

17

with respect to the way that these schools operate, the

18

evidence is also uncontradicted, that there are a large number

19

of lay people onths faculty.

20

Indeed, the head of the Psychology Department in
i

21

one of these collegas thestified that of the 7 full professors
i

22
23

on his staff, 4 of them were Jewish.
Q

How about the curriculum. Qo they include

24

courses in religious instruction , which it's mandatory for

25

the student to take?

&

ft

ii

1

A

1 believe that: those courses are not

2

mandatory for aan-Catholic students» I think that Catholic

3

students are required in some instances to take certain courses»

4

Again,’ however, these courses are not taught exclu­

5

sively by Catholic teachers. Almost every one of the schools,

6

for example, ahas a Rabbi on the staff. And interestingly en­

7

ough, the Rabbi is not restricted to teaching Jewish theology,

8

ha, one of the Rabbis teaches a basic course in introductory

9

Survey of Religion,

10

Now, I would like, if I may, just briefly, to refer

11

to the contention of Appellants that the statute doesn’t apply

12

to these, does not permit these grants.

13

That is, that the statute is silent on the type of

14

institutions that may recieva

15

about tis that it permits grants to institutions of higher

IQ

education. And that seems to be a neutral thing. But the

grants. All that it speaks

1

17

qualifications that the statute creates for the reciept of

18

these grants is based on the academic situation of the school,

19

not upon its religious affiliatin,

20

Howevdr, the

language of the statute strongly suggests

21

that Congress recognized that grants would be made to church

22

affiliated, religiously affiliated institutions because of

23

the specific exception for grants to divinity schools.

24
25

Now it’s common knowledge that most divinity schools
are operated by religiously affiliated institutions, and Congres 3

51

!

when Congress excepts from the permissible category of insti­

2

tutions that may recieve these construction grants» divinity

S

schools, it seems to me a very clear implication that grants

4

are permitted for non-divinity school aspects of these church

5

related institutions»

6

But if there is any question about this, I think

7

they're completely dispelled by the legislative history in

8

this case.

9

Q

Did you say that --- make grants to divinity

A

Mo, they can not make,, they specifically

10

schools?

11
12

cannot make grants to divinity schools under

13

and what I suggested is that the existence of that exception

14

is rather strong evidence, we think, that Congress recognized

15

that grants could he made to non-divinity school

16

that were

17

this statute,

institutions

connected with religious organizations.
But the legislative history, it seems to me, is really

18

clear beyond any doubt. First of all, there are a number of

19

people who testified during the course of the debates in

20

Congress that in order to accomplish the necessary expansion

2?

of the educations! facility, the private, non-religiously

22

affiliated and the public higher education institutions in

23

this country would not be enough.

24
25

Ehey need to pull upon the existing facilities of
the religious institutions. And while there was considerable

E;?

1

debate during the course of this legislation over the wisdom

2

and constitutionality of these grants, there was nobody who

3

suggested that the statute did not cover grants to these

4

institutions indeed, it's exactly to the opposite, because

S

several of the sponsors of the legislatio® explicitly

6

stated during the course of the debate that this statute doss

7

cover religiously affiliated institutions and indeed, in both

8

the House and the Senate, an amendment was proposed that

9

would have excluded grants to religiously affiliated insti­

10

tutions and that amendment was defeated by a voice vote, -—- ,

11

in both instances.

12

Q

Hr. Friedman, somewhere along the line

13

tell me whether there’s any implication in the fact that your

14

brief did not cite Bradfield.

15

A

No, Mr. Justice, there is no implication

16

and I have to confess that perhaps it is an oversight because

17

I think that is a persuasive authority, and if I may, may 1

18

cite another case that we have not cited in our brief, which

19

refers to Bnadfield, and that is a case called Quick Bear v.

20

(Lupe) in 210 US 50, and that was a case which involved the

21

validity of grants by the SEcretary of the Interior of Indian

22

Trust Funds, to be used to sponsor and send Indian children

23

to a parochial mission school on an Indian Reservation.

24
25

This was attacked on a number of grounds, including
the constitutional ground, and the Gourt disposed of the con-

si

i

stitutional question in one sentence * citing the Bradfieid

case» the Court said» "It is not contended that it is uncon­

affiliated school, have they exceeded an amount of grants

15

to religiously affiliated schools?

16
17
18

A

Yes. Let me just give

you some rough fig­

ures on that.
The record shows that the total grants since they've

19

started making grants in 1965 have been about a billion and

20

a half dollars. The best estimate they give is roughly 15% of

21

those grants have been to religiously affiliated schools»

22

another 15% have been to non religiously affiliated private

23

schools, and the remaining 70% roughly» have been to public

24

schools which may include state universities, community colleges,

25

technical—
54

Q
earlier,

1 take it the commitment which you mentioned
not to use to teach religion and so forth, is that

limited to a commitment by the religiously affiliated schools?
A

Oh

no. That is across the board and indeed,

the specific forms which they have to fill out in order to
qualify for the grant, these documents repeatedly point this
out to them and they are required to make these representations
along with many others with respect to the way -the facility
will be constructed.
Q

Does the legislative history show whether

there are any statements to the effect that the church schools
do not continue to run without government supposfcf?
A
Mr. Justice, was

there were not in connection, no, this bill,
not directed to that issue, this was just

directed, of course, to institutions of higher education,—Q

Well, did it show anything about that?

A

Mo. What it shows, Mr. Justice, is that

the belief of the Congress that the necessary expansion of
higher education facilities could not
the participation
Q
A

be accomplished without

of the religiously affiliated institution.
Why?
Because there just wasn't enough capacity

available with the existing——
Q

Wait a moment, they've been building, haven't

they?

55

1

A

Wall it was cne thing, 1 suggest, Mr.

2

Justice, to try to create a new institution, it’s another to

3

increase the capacity of existing institutions. And Congress

4

decided that the best way to deal with this problem facing

I
5
S

American higher education was to increase the Ccipacity of
existing institutions that already had the experience.in this

i

i

j
7

area.

I

8

Now if I may turn to the-—■

9

Q

Before you turn, let me just ask you one

10

thing about the survelance question, Suppose, 3 years after

11

a grant were made, and the building built, for chemistry and

12

mathematics, and biology, it suddenly

13

those subjects had been abandoned and it was being

14

a divinity school. I suppose the: government would move in and

15

do something about it, wouldn't they?

1
I

16

A

developed that all
used for

Yes. We would, do one of two things. As soon

17

as we found about it, the first thing we'd do is to tell them

18

to stop it. And if they were reluctant to stop it, refused
i

19

to stop it, we would then tell them that they had to

refund,

20

give us back some money, and I suppose that if they in effect

21

said that we won't do either, we would then taka whatever steps

22

had to be done.

23

Q

I suppose maybe an eviction proceeding.

24

A

Coneievably an eviction proceeding, concie-

25

vably a suggestion of some sort of forfeiture, w&ll I don't

56

1

know if we could forfeit the land , but certainly we could go

2

against them and I suppose sue iihem in effect for breach of

3

contract and get as a measure of damages whatever the amount

4

was we contributed.

5

Q

Then, if Imay pursue that by carrying

.it

6

over to the Everson case,,

7

busses

8

it was learned that a religious teacher was put on the bus

9

every morning so that they wouldn’t lose this time and they

20

were reciting the Lords Prayer and singing religious hymns,,

II

and listening to religious instruction.

suppose it developed after school

were provided to take elementary children to school

12

I suppose that would be stppped too, wouldn’t it?

13

A

I would suppose they presumably would

14

say that

25

long as the bus was being used for that purpose.

26

they would not extend any subsidy to parents as

Q

Does the one in your mind under the Ever­

17

son situation call for any more survelance, government ser­

28

ve lance of the religious institution than the other?

29

A

1 don't think so, f<1r. Chief Justice.

20

Q

I suppose as soon as this deviation occurred

22
22

there would be a graat many people calling attention to
.

A

it.

Well, that’s right. For example the way

23

the record shox»7s the way they found about one of these 3 cases

24

that I have

25

paper clipping to the Office of Education

referred to is someone sent

57

in a news -

containing a story

1

on the use of one of these facilities as apparently as a chapel

2

for holding religious exercises.

3

Q

Mr. Friedman, is there anything in the

4

legislative history indicating that there was consideration

5

whether building more colleges, more universities was or was

6

not a more acceptifoie alternative than using religiously af-

7

filiated schools?

8
9

A

I don't think it was focused that specif-

ically. I cannot be sure of that, Mr. Justice, because I

10

haven't read, frankly all of the debates are very lengthy, but

11

the debates I have read indicate

12

of the fact that the capacity was needed and that the relig­

13

iously affiliated schools for a long time had been an essen­

14

tial portion of American higher education—

that there was a recognition

15

Q

And it was better to expand that——

case?
A

Yes, I would be bappy fee say right now that

I think it fits into the-Q

it was cited only once, I guess, cited

as a compare case.
A

Yes, the Appellants rely very heavily on

7

the Horace Mann standard. We think that the standard applied

8

by the Maryland Court of Appeals in the Horace Mann case,

9

which is a determination whether the institution as an entity

10

was primarily sectarian or primarily secular, we do not think

1?

that that is the test that this Court has considtently applied

12

in dealing with establishment clause.

13

Q

What did we do, dismiss that?

14

A

Well, there were two things. You denied

15

the Petition for Certiorari ir, one of them and you dismissed

16

the Appeal in the other one. There were

Q

two---

When you say we haven’t consistently done

anything, you’re only talking about 2 cases.
A

Well, Mr. Justice, I suggest I’m talking

about 4. Because I’d like to—-

21

Q

Everson and Waiz and what else?

22

A

Everson, Walls, we start, with the test, which

23

is the purpose and primaryeffeet test. That test was formulated

24

in 1963 in (Shemp). That test was used 3 times more in 1963 j

25

the Court applied the purpose and primary effect test in the

EQ

1

Allen case. And the same year

2

the Everson case involving the validity of the Arkansas anti-

3

evolution statute and then last year in the Walz case, al­

4

though it didn’t quote the language of that purpose and

5

effect test, it did use that language and cited the case at

6

that point.

7
8

Q

it applied the same test in

Yourre saying, really, that there is only

one test that——

10

Q

“—-define, and that’s the purpose—

n

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice, and let

That is——
/

12

me say with respect to Mr.Pfeffers contention that somehow

13

Everson is the test and if this Court is going to drop

14

Everson now it should do so explicitly.

15

In the (Shexnp) case, when the Court first ennunciated

16

the purpose and primary effect test, immediately after quoting

17

the language which we rely on, it cited the Everson case.

18

So obviously the Court must have believed that the

19

purpose and effect test, it was there announcing represented

20

an application

2?

that the Court announced in Everson.

22

of the somewhat broader generalized principles

Now, the Appellants argument, the Appellants attack

23

on the purpose and effect test, rests almost exclusively

24

on the notion that somehow the secular and the sectarian are

25

so intertwined that any meaningful separation is impossible.

60

1

I think the Court crossed that bridge in the Allan

2

case, where it rejected the notion that somehow you couldn’t

3

separate secular and the sectarian. It recognized there that

4

the religiously affiliated schools

5

functions.

6

performed two distinct

And if it was felt there that there was no such per­

7

meation of the two, such intermingling of the two, when you!re

8

dealing with children in

9

where they’re far more impressionable than mature college

the primary and elementary schools,

10

students, certainly you cannot make that claim in this con­

II

tent, where we're dealing with students in college and indeed,

12

some of these universities have graduate schools.
The purpose here is plainly secular, there can be

33
14

no question of that. It was designed to accomplish an expansion,

15

a desperately needed expansion of the facilities available,

16

for higher education.
•Q

17

Facilities as defined in the legislation,

includes only buildings, does it not?

18
19

A

Buildings or certain equipment.

20

C

for—-

2!

A

Yes. For example, one of the grants here

22

involved a foreign language laboratory. And it also excludes

23

certain types of buildings. For example they ordinarily couldn't

24

give a grant for atheistic facilities unless this was part of

25

a course in Physical Education.

Libraries has two meanings, it means a

A

No, this means the building in which the

books are housed. That's all they give. These are grants for
facilities, for physical facilities to be used—
Q

Structures, building structures plus cer­

tain equipment.
A

Yes. And I would . just like to say one last

14

thing in conclusion becuase I have to turn the argument over

15

to my Co-Counsel, that the statute, the

effect. Now of course, this statute, these grants obviously

17

do help the church affiliated institutions.They help them in

18

much the same way that the parochial schools were aided by

subsidizing ther parents for the bus fares in Everson,

20

they are aided by paying for the books in Allen.

The government here does maintain its neutral position

2

toward religion andwe think that the way this statute is

structured does permit room for that benevolent play at the

joints which this Court indicated last year in Walz is one

5

of the essential elements under the establishment clause.

MR. AHERN; I think I can finish in that

but we'll run a few minutes over if

time, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court.
Since the interest in the State of Connecticut in
this case is identical to the interests &f the United States

6

government, we subscribe to the arguments advanced by the

7

government in it's briefs and in oral argument here this morning.

8

21

In addition I should like to point up one or two as­
pects of the case very briefly which we think the Court
should consider very carefully.
Now while the Appellants in this case have stated

22

that they brought this action, they could have brought this

23

action in any state of the United States, the fact remains

24

that they brought the action against 4 colleges in the state

25

of Connecticut, and named the state of Connecticut as a defendant
63

1

in the ease.
While we have not officially sought to represent all

2
3

of the states in this matter,, we feel that by being named a

4

defendant in the

5

resentative without portfolio for all of the states , in this

6

area.

case we have been cast in the role of rep­

7

Incidentally, this role seems quite appropriate in

8

this case, because Connecticut is known as the Constitution

9

state.

m

I want to emphasise to the Court that each of the

ii

states in the United States are participating

12

program and are vitally interested in seeing that federal

13

funds continue to flow under this Act to the states to enlarge

14

and expand educational facilities in order to accomodate the

15

rapidly growing numbers of young people aspiring to higher

16

education.

17

in this grant

I should also like to direct the Courts attention
to the fact that in view of the

state of the Congressional

Record, when this Act was being considered, I don’t think it
can be seriously contended by Appellants that Congress intended
to violate the establishment clause of the Constitution by pro­
viding federal funds to religion.
The Congressional purpose, clearly stated in debate
and in Section 701 of the Act, was to meet an educational
crisis by providing funds for academic facilities to further the

64

1

2
3

educational development of its citizenry which would be bene­
ficial to the whole nation.
We submit it was to implement that national purpose

4

that the Act was adopted. And

5

that the states have participated in the grant program.

6

it was to advance that purpose

I would also like to point

out that Congress

7

evidently anticipated the recent holding of this Casa in

8

Courts Walz decision to the effect that excessive entanglement

9

by the government in administration of religion might

10

11

make thelegislation be declared unconstitutional.
Under the Act under consideration here, each state

12

was required to establish an agency for the purpose of screening

13

grant applications and establishing priorities among projects

14

within the state.

15

However, the states were given no authority to adopt

16

supplemental guidelines with respect to hiring practices,

17

or for inspection proceedures subsequent to construction.

18

The states' responsibility and authority terminated

19

when the application was approved and submitted to the U.S.

20

Commissioner of Education.

21

In like manner, the Congress provided in Section 757

22

q£ the Act, that the United States Government could not

23

become involved in, and I quote, "the personnel, curriculum,

24

methods of instruction, or administration of the colleges

25

which recieve grants".
65

I

The sole responsibility and authority of the gov­

2

ernment after completion of construction was to determine

3

for a period of 20 years, by on site inspection,

4

the facility was being used for the purpose for which it

5

was constructed.

religious purposes.
Accordingly, I submit that Congress could not have
done more to avoid entanglement with religion by the Federal
Government of the states.
Q

What’s the total amount of these religious

institutions in Connecticut have recieved since the Act-A

I don’t recall how much

was recieved

14

by all of the religious, the church related institutions in

'15

Connecticut, but it’s only a portion of the building costs

16

for each project.

17

Q

You don't know the dollar figure?

18

A

I don't know the dollar figure, I believe

19
20

Mr. Williams will have that for the Court tomorrow.
In conclusion I would just like to state that Counsel

21

for the Appellants here this afternoon

22

and quite a significant issue, of the fact that he has labeled

23

the 4 colleges intthis case sectarian whereas the Appellees

24

refer to them as church related.

25

has made an issue

And he indicated that he was consistent throughout the

£6

1

casa in labeling and calling them sectarian.

2

I would refer the Court to page

9S of the Appendix

3

in which the stipulation entered into between Counsel for

4

the Appellants and the State of Connecticut as set forth, and

S

further direct the Courts attention to paragraph 16 in which

6

we considered and used and agreed upon the following lang­

7

uage.

8

to consider questions raised concerniing the constitutionality

9

of grants to church related institutions on at least several

10

"The Commission and members thereof have had occasion

occasions."
So I submit that Counsel for the Appellants on

II
12

occassion has used ther term church related in referring

13

to these institutions. Thasik you.
Q

14

Thank you, Mr. Ahern.
