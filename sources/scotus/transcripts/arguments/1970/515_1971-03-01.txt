ORAL ARGUMENT BY LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you# Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:

11

The United States asked the Court to review this

12

case because it seamed to us that the decision of the Court of

13

Claims was inconsistent with and threatened to undermine clearly

14

and repeatedly expressed Congressional ' policies regarding the

15

jurisdiction and the business of the Indian Claims Commission.

16

25

From the outset Congress has imposed explicit
limitations on the Commissioni jurisdiction and has specified
that it is a temporary tribunal whose business is to be com­
pleted within a fixed period of years.
It was originally established with a life span of
ten years in legislation enacted in 1946 and in the course of
three-five-year extensions of the life of the Commission#
Congress has shown increasing impatience to see the Commission's
business concluded.
We express this legislative history in our brief
2

1

and the- current state of the Commission5s business indicates

2

that it is unlikely that that business will be concluded when

3

the present life of the Commission expires in 1312 a but we feel

4

that in light of the Congressional policies expressed we axe
.

S

obliged to try to see that that business is expedited»

s

We reproduce on page 12 of our petition for

7

certiorari in this case, some statistics about the present

0

state of the Commission^ business.

petition in August of 1970 158 Commission cases have proceeded

At the time we filed the

11

been settled by compromise and 159 cases remain to be disposed

of.

the status of

14

now 160 of the cases have proceeded to judgment and 157 remain

15

to be disposed of.

17
18

There has, to the bast of our knowledge, been a chance in
only two cases in the intervening months so that

Q

How does this Court get into this?

Are we

supposed to speed them up?
A

Well, we are attempting in this case, to

19

enable the Commissiones business to be concluded in accordance

20

with this Congressional policy, by asking this Court to review,

21

and the Court agreed to review the Court of Claims decision,

22

which seemed to us to undermine, to jeopardise this Congression­

23

al policy in two ways, Mr. Justice.

24
23

One is that it seemed to us to impair the finality
of the judgments which have been arrived at in these cases,
3

1

particularly the judgments arrived at through the process of

2

settlement and compromise.

3

failed to properly respect the principles 3f res

.4

this case.

We believe the Court: of Claims
■ .judicata in

5

And the second way in which this decision seemed

6

to us to jeopardise these Congressional policies,, is by imper-

7

missbly expanding the Commission’s jurisdiction beyond the

3

statutory cutoff dates that Congress imposed on the Commission’s

9

jurisdiction.

io

n
12

13

And if I may, I’ll proceed first to the res
.judicata issue in the case because, under our view of the
case, that issue should b© dispositive of the case inthis Court.
Now, there is a lengthy background, historical

14

background, which I think need not be reviewed in detail.

I

15

have asked the Clerk to distribute a map to each of the Justices

16

which may illuminate a little bit just what wa are talking about

17

here relative to the res judicata issue before us.

18

Much of the history that’s reviewed by this Court

19

in a decision involving 330' U.S., written by Mr. Justice Black,

20

called “The Confederated Bands of Ute Indians against the

21

United Statesthat’s 330 U.S. 169.

22

in 1868 a reservation was established by a treaty arrangement

23

by the Confederated Band of Utes which included all of the Ute

24

Indians, and that reservation was the entire large rectangular

25

area on this map bordered in red, and also in orange at one

4

It was there noted that

1

point.
And the treaty specified that any change in the

2

3

reservation mutt be approved by three-quarters of the males of

4

the entire Federated Band of Ufces.
The first change that took place was in 1874, the

5
6

so-called "Bruno Cession," which is no

7

present case, and ‘that ceded-'to the United

8

the rectangular area marked off in yellow-orange crayon in our

9

map.

in dispute in the
States that area

And, remaining after the Bruno Cession, which was

10

approved'by three-quarters of the males in the entire Confed­

u

erated Band, was -the rest of the reservation, which was all one

12

undifferentiated Ute reservation at the time, as it had. been

13

under the 1868 legislation.
The map that we have used includes numbers on it,

14

15

so-called Royce numbers which were later applied by Charles

IS

Royce, who drew up this map.

This is a copy of Charles Royce8s

At the time there was no such thing as

Royce Areas; there was only the one undifferentiated Ute
reservation.
Then, by an agreement reached in 1880 as a result
■V .
of the massacre which occurred at the Meeker agency in the
northern portion of the reservation, and this too was reviewed
in this Court’s previous ease, there was, in effect, a forced
sale of this entire reservation to the United States, and Idle
language of the 1830 Agreement ceded the reservation to the

United States»

We have it reproduced in our brief? in the

appendix to our brief? the legislation which is found in Volume

G

and the United States, And on page 44 of our brief you will

7

find the relevant that the Chiefs and Headmen — I am reading

3

the last full paragraph now — of the Confederated Bands agreed

3

to use their best efforts to procure the consent

This is an agreement between the Confeder­

~ it had to

10

be the consent of three-quarters of the males —- to cede to the

11

United States? all the territory of the present Ute reservation

12

in Colorado? with the exception of provision for settlement by

13

individual Indians in severalty.
In the case of the Utes in the southern portion

14
15

that settlement was to be made along the La Plata River in

IS

Colorado? which is the area shaded in in green on our map? and

17

if there was insufficient land there for the allotments and

18

severalties to the individual Indians? then they were to be

19

settled on the La Plata River and its vicinity in New Mexico,

20

That language is read at the bottom of page 44 of the statute.
And? repeatedly -the statute refers to this proviso

to discussion on all of the lands as a proviso for allotments

And again at

Accordingly; in this Court’s previous decision

"This act authorised

‘She Court referred to these as the lands ceded? all

of the lands on the present reservation.
The dominant intent of -those who sponsored this

12

legislation and this treaty, was to extinguish reservation life

13

for the Ute Indians, which is clear from the reports and from

14

the legislative history which we cite extensively in our brief,

15

which was partly for retaliatory reasons because of the mas­

IS

sacres and partly it represented prevalence of the view that

17

many held at the time that it was wasteful of land to try to

IS

maintain the Indians in their aboriginal state? that they should

19

be settled on homesfeead-sised farms to be farmers.

20

The views were expressed by some who opposed the

21

legislation, that the Indians- 'weren’t ready for this kind of

22

settlement but those views did not prevail.

23
24
25

The act was enacted

and the agreement was duly ratified by the Ute Indians-, by the
Confederated Band, including the Respondent.
There was subsequent legislation which was not

referred to in the course of the settlement agreement of 1950

on which we rely and on which I will refer to just briefly»

the historical part of our brief we refer' to the subsequent

4

legislation at some length.

6

provided for the first time for the line to be surveyed which

16

so that the northern portion could be opened to nonlndian

18

19

that those southern Indians were to be settled along the La

That is correct.

That was why Congress said that this

Until 1895, and as we think this Court read

the statutes in the case that I have cited to you.

significance* because of the

13

The Confederated Bands of Ut@s, including the

14

Southern Utes, were awarded almost $32 million in settlement.

15

Judge Skelton estimates that this amounted to $15,600 per

The

settlement provided, pursuant to a stipulation of the tribes
that 40 percent of the awards would go

to the Southern Utes,

including the Respondents.
And this is recited in Section 672 of Title XXV
of the United Code.

It seems significant to us that, although

the Respondents now claim that no Southern Ute lands were in­
volved in that settlement, their percentage of the award,the
40 percent, was larger than the one-third which was specified
in the 1880 Agreement and legislation as the share that the

11

t

Southern Utas were to take » in proceeds under that agreement

2
3

Q

Were there any reservations or claims of

the Southern Ufces in settlement agreement?

4

A

There were not* sir.

As a matter of fact»

5

the settlement agreement recited very specifically, and this is

6

at page 438 of Volume 117 in the Court of Claims? "Such judg­

7

ment shall be final adjudication of all issues between the

0

plaintiffs and the defendants in the case.”

9

to each of the settlements and I quoted the one that's directly

10

11

relevant here.

It recited this as

It was on page 438 of Volume 117.
Also, of great significance, in our view, is the

12

content in which this settlement and judgment were reached?

13

the context of contemporaneous litigation in this Court between

14

the same parties represented by the

15

11 and 12 of our brief we cite counsel for the Utes* repeated

16

emphatic representation in that case in the complaint and in the

17

briefs, in the cases in Volume 330 U. S. that the 1880 Agreement

18

had ceded to the Government all of the Consolidated Band's

19

Colorado lands except for the individual allotments and severalty

20

which were provided for.

21

same counsel.

At pages

And it is noted in our brief this was also the

22

view taken in previous Court of Claims cases and the Government

23

in its brief in that case in this Court, acknowledged the cor­

24

rectness of these representations.

25

Moreover, this Court, in language which we quote
12

1

in our brief on page 25 of our brief, and I think this is very

2

significant.

3

pending Court of Claims litigation which reached settlement

4

three years later in 1950, and said, in the language that we

3

quote there in the middle of page 25 ©f our briefs except for

6

certain treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning

7

which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in

0

Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid, are those to

9

the north of and outside the 1868 Treaty Reservation and the

This Court specifically referred to the then

10

Court in that case, this Court, rejected their claim for pay­

11

ment for those lands that were north of the Treaty Reservation,

12

the original treaty.

13
14
15
16
17

X8
19

20
21

22
23

And the Court went on to says "It is conceded
that Petitioners, the Consolidated Utes, including -the Respon­
dents, have either been or are currently pressing litigation in
the Court of Claims by which they seek to be compensated for the]
White River Valley land? in fact, all of the land which was
contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation

and

that is the entire large rectangle on the map, which of course
includes the lands in the southern strip for which the Court of
Claims upheld an additional award in this case.
Now-’, we emphasise this language? we believe it is
correct, but we emphasise this language, not because there is no
possibility that this Court could have been in error in saying
this, but because this language was based on representations of

13

?

•die same counsel who then negotiated the settlement agreement.

2

They were aware of what this Court had held and had said in the

3

casein 1947 and if seems inconceivable to us, at least, that

4

Counsel, aware that the Court had said this about thelitigation

5

then pending, would enter into a settlement agreement using this

6

broad language referring to all of the lands ceded in the 1880

7

Act without reservation of any other claims; a settlement which

8

recites as the final adjuciation of. everything that was at issue:

9

in those cases, it seems inconceivable to us that counsel would

10

enter into such a settlement agreement, using that language in■

11

the context ©f this Court's recent opinion if they had meant to

12.

reserve further claims to these southern lands.
Q

13

Well, you are going to, Mr. Wallace, you

14

are going to address yourself to what the doors, what doors the

15

other side claim were left open by the settlement?
A

16
17

Well, they of course point to statements

that were previously made by the Secretary of the Interior arid

18

by other officials in the Interior Department, the latest of

19

which were in 1938 in which, in our view there was some con­

20

fusion as to what was established by the 1880 Act —Q

21

22

Well, how d© you -— yes, but how does the

other side get into this, take this settlement agreement apart
and say;

about it, but frankly I don’t sea that

That is what — that embraced all of the

land in their reservation.

5
6

Well, they only covered — for one thing

Well, the majority of the Court of Galisns

thought something' was left over —
A

II

Well, the majority of the Court of Claims

12

entered parole evidence on the question of the parties * intent

13

and took the Government 'severely to task because we raised the

14

claim of executive privilege with respect to the attorney’s

15

work product, of the attornies who negotiated the settlement

16

with the Respondents, who wanted to refer to his notes and work

17

product.

13

He was no longer in the Government.
But, really, declaring executive privilege, in our

19

view, essentially is superfluous.

Our basic position was that

20

this was not a situation that admitted of parole evidence.

Well, what if it were, Mr. Wallace?

22

A

Well, then there would be an issue --

As to whether the claim of executive

privilege was a proper one

it wasn't and parole evidence is quite proper —

would have been suggested that was left open?

In terms of

We didn't mean to do what?

Well, their claim is that we had treated

tiie 1880 Act right along as reserving a reservation for the

10

Southern Utes, even though it did not, in terras, reserve any­

n

thing but individual allotments and it was not until the 1895

12

Act that anything can be found in the statute books which in­

13

dicates the —

14

Q

Well, what's your answer to that?

10

A

Well, my answer is;

these "even though"

16

clauses.

There had been some misunderstanding by some Interior

17

Department officials as to the effect of the 1880 Act, the

78

effect of the 1895 Act, but always in the context in which it

19

was immaterial whether the reservation was established by the

20

one or the other, and these matters, these expressions of con­

21

fusion which ara cited and we refer to them in our reply brief,

22

were remote

23

being conducted in 1947 through 1950 in the context of what

24

counsel, the very same counsel, had said to this Court and what

25

this Court had said which indicates completely, in our view,

in time from the settlement negotiations that were

Well, it seems to us clear from the con­

text that the attornies who had just litigated this case in this

10

Court and were aware of the language that this Court has used,

11

if they entered into a sweeping settlement agreement as they

12

did, it seems to us the way any other judgment is treated they

13

obviously meant to settle all the claims that were issued»

14

would certainly be the view of an anti-trust consent decree or

15

any other settlement judgments.
We don't think that this judgment, which is the

16

result of a compromise negotiated by very able counsel over a
period of several years, should be treated any differently.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GLEN A. WILKINSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WILKINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it
18

1

please the Court:

2

I'm having a chart brought in, if I may, so that,

3

as Mr. Wallace says, the history of the treatment by the United

4

States of the Confederated Bands of the Ute Indians — Con­

5

federated Bands of Ute Indians by the United States is somewhat

6

complicated.

7

we see it and es it relates to the case before the Court today.
Like the Government's sketch, this is adopted

8
9
10

from Royce; 1896 Bureau of Ethnology Report Interpretation ox
Indian Land Cessions in the United States.
Prior to 1868 the Confederated Bands of Ute

11
12.

I would like to use this to give the picture as

Indians, who were composed of the White River Band, the

3

Uncoxnpahgre Band and the Southern Ute Band, occupied in the

4

usual Indian fashion, a tremendous area in Colorado, New Mexico

15

and Utah.

16

In 1868 the Confederated Bands, the three units

7

comprising the Confederated Bands agreed to limit its area of

18

occupation to the outside perimeters shown on this sketch;

13

approximately or just slightly lower than 16 million acres.

20
21

Q

Mr. Wilkinson, in 1868 approximately how

many people are involved in these tribes and bands?

22

A

Somewhere between three and 4,000 people.

23

In 1873, as counsel has explained, there was a

24

highly mineralized area found in the location of Colorado v/hich

25

is identified here as Royce Area 566.

The United States obtained

19
i

1

from the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians an agreement to cede

2

that and it was ceded in 1873, ratified by an Act of Congress

3

of 1874.
The next Act, of course, was -the agreement between

4

5

the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians and the United States an

6

agreement which was worked at by nine representatives of the

7

three bands constituting the Confederated Bands of Ute Indians

8

over a period of several weeks in Washington.
As indicated, it was desired by the people of

9
10

Colorado and probably people in Congress that the Confederated

u

Bands be removed from Colorado because of many things, but be­

12

cause eventually the Meeker Massacre, which occurred in 1879.
That agreement provided that the chiefs and head­

13
14

men of the Confederated Bands would exercise their most per­

15

suasive powers to get their people to agree to a cession of

16

land indicated in what I call the 1868 Reservation.

17

meat had to be ratified and accepted by three-quarters of the

18

male adult Utes.

19

ratification.

20

That agree'

It was to be brought back to Congress for

It provided for a cessionof the 1868 reservation

21

with two extremely important exceptions: one was that it pro­

22

vided that the Uncompahgre Band which occupied generally the

23

middle area of the 1868 Reservation was to be provided with land
on the Grand River near the mouth of the Gunnison River in the
western portion of the middle section of this area.
20

The other important exception and the one which

2
2

determines this case is the fact that it reserved for the

3

Southern Ufce area the area in the south which the Southern Utes

4

had used from time immemorial.

5

the agreement, agreed to remove to and remain on the La Plata

6

River and the area adjacent to it in the State of Colorado, and

7

if that was insufficient then on the La Plata River and area

8

adjacent in the territory of New Mexico.

The Southern Utes, as a part of

This was a way of expressing where the Southern

9

2

Utfes were living and continued to live and the first definite

i?

expression of this comes from the fact that Mr. Manypenny, who

12

was Chairman of the Commission appointed pursuant to the Act sf

13

138 , when he visited the Southern Utes, recommended to the

14

Department of Interior and the Congress that the area hereto­

15

fore and presently occupied by the Southern Utes should be pre­

16

served for the home of the Southern Utes.

17

There was a reaction of Congress —

13

Q

One of the questions in the case is

whether that was a reservation or whether it was simply a

2

designation of the area to be occupied by the southern members

Q

And whether or not that was a reservation

at that time was a key issue in this case; isn't it?
A

Whether it was reserved for the Southern

Utes; that's right.
The 1882 Act came along; there was concern and
the Attorney General had told Congress that it could not dis­

to

pose under the public land laws, the area indicated as S16 with­

n

out additional legislation.

12

Congress responded with two thoughts inthe 1882

13

legislation; first, it opened area 616 to disposal under the

14

public land laws and it provided for a line to be drawn between

15

the area to be disposed of under that act and the area occupied

16

by the Southern Ute Tribes.

17

indicated, from the southwest corner of the Royce Area 566 to

18

the boundary of the Territory of Utah,

19

That line was drawn, as I have

Now, from that period on, from 1882 until 1895

20

in every session of Congress, save one — in those days most of

21

the Congresses had three sessions — there was legislation

22

pending concerning the treatment and disposition of the Southern

23

Utes and their lands.

24
25

When it came along to 1888 Congress passed a law
which established a commission to negotiate with the Southern
22

?

Utes for preservation or settling of.their treaty and other

2

rights, including the possibility of exchange of their reserva­

3

tion — the word is in quotations: "their reservation".

4

"reservation" meant only Royce Area 617.

5

with the Otes.

And

They reached agreement

The Utes agreed —■ the Southern Utes, to trade

6
7

that area for an area in Utah territory three times as large as

8

this.

9

were sort of unwanted people at this time, even the Territory

There was objection from the citizens in Utah. The Utes

10

of New Mexico didn't want them to move there.

But this agree­

n

ment in 1888 which provided for exchange of their reservation

12

for the exchange for the land in Utah was reached by the Com­

13

mission and it passed the Senate.

14

there was continuation of legislative effort throughout.

It died in the House.

Still,

And about 1893 or 1894 Congress started — changed

15
16

its direction toward the handling of the Southern Ute Reserva­

17

tion.

18

adequate and ample administrative recognition of the ownership

10

of the area, Royce 617 involved on the part of the administrative,

20

officers of the United States.

21

And I might say that during all of this time there was

But, when 1895 came along, Congress paid some

22

slight heed or attention to the Act of 1880 as saying that the

23

property involved in Royce Area 617 should be handled as pro­

24

vided by the 1880 Treaty as herein provided.
N

25

It then changed directions considerably from what

23

1

it had done in the 1830 act.

The 1880 Act had provided, for

2

instance, the proceeds from the lands to be sold, in Royce Area

3

6,16 should be divided three ways: between the White River, the

4

Uncompahgres and the Southern Utes.

5

In 1895 and even though the Treaty of 1868 had

6

required that any cession of Ute land obtain permission from

7

three-quarters of the male adults of the bands involved, it
provided vastly different factors»

First it created a division I

between Royce Area 617»- ' It said:

those members of the

8
9
10

Southern Ute Tribe tfho elect and are qualified to receive

11

al atraents, shall be alloted in the area at the east end of this

12

tract; as to those who did not elect or were not qualified, the

13

Government would create a reserve for them, a reservation in a

14

40-mile tract in the western end of the Royce Area 617»
Congress didn't require that three-quarters of the

15
16

male adult Utes vote for this; it required only a majority

17

vote.

18

It also provided that within six months following the

passage of that act the President should arrange for the allot­

19

ments for those to be allotted in the eastern end and the

20

balance should be sold under the public land laws at not less

21

than $1.25 per acre.

22
23
24
25

Q

And that was in what year; 1895?

A

The proclamation was actually issued four years
later, in 1899.

mately 1,070,000 acres.

Q

And there were how many at that time?

A

There were about 1100,

This is one of the

factors which caused Congress to give this problem so much con­
sideration and also caused the administrative officers to be so
concerned.
The Southern Utes were sitting on a strip of land
just 15 miles wide and advancing settlement was encroaching on
all sides, especially with the north and south.

The City of

Durango(?) which was in the cession of 1873, around 1895
25

i

had reached a population of 4,000 people.

z

were concerned that friction would develop between the non-

3

Indians and the Indians and this is one of the reasons they

4

were anxious to remove the Southern Utes from what 'the admini-

5

strative officers considered a small slender portion of land

6

on which they had li-ved.

The administrators

Nowi the area on the east which was not allotted,

7

8

was put up for sale and in 1902 Congress passed another Act

3

which was called the "Free Homesteads Act."

Now, the 1895 Act

10

which provided for the allotting in the east, provided that

11

after the deduction of the expenses of the sale the remainder oi

12

the proceeds should be saved and put in -trust for the benefit

13

of the Southern Utes and the Southern Utes onlyj another clear

14

indication of the Congressional recognition that Roycs Area 617

15

was Southern Ute Territory.
Now, two administrative decisions came along in

17

1903 and 1920.

18

He used as his theory the fact that this held been ceded by the

19

Act of 1880.

20

by the Secretary of Interior.

21

application was made unde: the Minerals Act of 1920 and again

22

was denied by the Secretary of the Interior.

23

In 1903 one man sought a homestead in that area.

His application was denied and reviewed and denied
The same application, type of

And the final main act which shows beyond any

24

doubt that this area, Royce Area 61? was preserved for the

25

Southern Utes and was not ceded by the Act of 1880, is che fact
26

1

that in that year the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to

2

provisions of the Indian Reorganization/Act of 1934, restored

3

to the Southern Ute Tribe in excess of 300,000 acres of land

4

in the eastern section of Royee Area 617 which had not been

5

disposed of under the public land laws.

6

In the meantime, between 1900 and 1938 the United

7

States Government had given awaj, free to homesteaders, in

0

excess of 225,000 acres of land.

9

of the Act of 1895 which provided for sale of that land to

It did this in clear violation

to

settlers at not less than $1.25 per acre, the balance to be

11

saved and held in trust for the Southern Utes.

12

Now, the Government says: "We ignore all of this

13

history; we ignore the recognition by Congress over a continued

14

long period of time and we do this because, in the settlement

15

of other cases unrelated to this area, involving other parties,

16

involving other issues, there is a stipulation which provided

17

in a catch-all phrase that the settlement of four cases which

18

were involved there, and only one is really important here, and

19

that is Case Number 46640, the judgment to be entered is res

20

jiidicata, not only as to the land described in schedule 1, but

21

whether included therein or not, also as to any lands formerly

22

owned or claimed, by the plaintiffs in Western Colorado, ceded

to defendant by the Act of June 15, 1830.

Let's suppose that the Government wins and leaves

the Utes only with the land which there is no controversy about

now.

12

According to the population.

How much land would that be for each Indian? per Indian?

A

I don't know, Your Honor.

I would judge

there are 450,000 acres in the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation,

Mr, Wilkinson, on your theory of the case,•

20

what is the explanation for the 40 percent part of the settle­

22

A

The settlement was for lands involved in

Royce Area 616,

24

Bands of Ute Indians and those judgments were all for the

25

Confederated Bands of Ute Indians,

There were three components of the Confederated

36

The Southern Utes received

1

40 percent; the Uncompahgre Utes received* I think, 20 percent

2

and the White River Utes* 40 percent; something on that order*

because all* pursuant to the Treaty of 1868* owned the land

S

Utes on the premises you described as the 1950 settlement, got

7

the lion's share of it?-

8

A

They didn't, Your Honor,

9

Q

Well, they got 40 percent,

10

A

Bv that time there were two tribes and each

11

of them got 20 percent.

Combined, taking the old Southern Ute

Tribe they got 40 percent.

approximately the same and the Whita River Band got about 20

percent,

Likewise, the Uncompahgre Band got
.

Now, the treaty or the agreement of 1880 provided j

15
16

for a three-way split between these bands, but

the population

17

shifts that occurred up tcT the time of the stipulation in 1950

18

have been such that the tribes agreed among themselves upon

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
ON BEIIA1F OF PETITIONERS

1?.

13

And we ask

MR. WALLACE:

Well, just very briefly, Mr. Chief

14

Justice, I do want, to call specific attention to page 8 ©£ our

15

reply brief that we filed in this Court, in which we quote from

IQ

the brief that was filed on behalf of the Confederated Utes in

17

this Court in 1947, including the response —*

18

Q

When was the reply brief filed?

19

A

Our reply brief was filed in February, 1973

20
21

On the front cover it says: Petitioner's Reply Brief.
On page 8 of that reply brief we quote from the

22

brief that was filed by Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Ernest Wilkinson,

23

Mr. Glen Wilkinson's law partner, in this Court in 1946 term in

24

the case that I have referred to previously, and that brief

25

said that "the central purpose of the 1880 Act”was "to acquire
39

all of the land of the then 6present Ute Reservation, '" and
the sole "exceptions51

-

Q

Sale, sale.

^

A

Well,, that is a misprint? 19m sorry.

The

word should be "sole," and the "sole exceptions were un­
occupied agricultural lands on the La Plata River, agricultural
lends on Grand River, et cetera, for indMdual allotments."
That is the representation that the Ute Band made at this time.
They now claim that that reservation in the 1830 act was for a
reservation for the Southern Ute Tribe.
It seems to me that in light of what they said
in the 1947 litigation and what this Court has said, that the
stipulation in 1950 would have run quite differently if they
had meant to reserve some Ute lands from that settlement.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wallace?

thank you, Mr. Wilkinson.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:14 o'clock a.m., the argument in.
the above-entitled matter was concluded)
