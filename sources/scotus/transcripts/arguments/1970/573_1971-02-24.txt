ORAL ARGUMENT BY HERSZIEL SHANKS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

8

9

We will resume

MR. SHANKS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I:d like to begin this morning by noting that

10
11

there are many aspects of the Florida educational financing

12

system which are very fine, indeed, and to the extent that they

13

are good, we applaud them.

14

system which discriminates on the basis of wealth and to that

15

extent, we attack it as unconstitutional.

But there is one element in this

Basically, the Florida system is this: the state

16

17

distributes to each of the counties on a very fair and well-

18

considered basis a major portion of the funds for financing

19

the school system.

20

present fact that this is sufficient to fund an adequate educa­

21

tional system.

I am willing to assume here, contrary to

Added

Added to this basic grant and on top of this is

22
23

the amount that the local counties add through their local tax

24

effort.

25

amount, this educational frosting —-

Now, I'm even willing to assume here that this added

2

1

Q

Is an educational what?

2

A

Frosting on the cake, Your Honor.

3
JS

other words its something additional which the — I don't
think in fact is, but I8m willing to assume it here.
But, we insist that even the frosting be dis­

5
8
7

tributed on an equal basis; that is: without discrimination
based on wealth.
The Millage Rollback Act, together with the

8

9
iiO

11
12

13
14

statutes which authorize Florida counties to tax, create a
system where they give to each county a certain authority to
add this educational frosting, to raise these dollars.

17
18
19
20
21

22
23

In

some counties it8s $700’a pupil? in other counties it's six,
five, four, and down to $50 a pupil.

Each is treated less

well, depending — as it goes down the wealth scale.
So that it9s not a question of only two categoriesj

15
16

In

it’s a sliding scale and everybody but the top county is dis­
advantaged .
Now, we are not opposed to limitations as such on
local efforts.

We don’t even insist on a particular formula

that the limitation should take.

There are a variety of con­

stitutional formulas? for example: Florida, a Florida court, in
its wisdom, says that each county will be limited to $100 a
pupil, or it could say each county would be limited to a
thousand dollars in instruction units and 'the instruction unit,

24
as was discussed yesterday, is a very complicated formula which
25
3

1

2

takes into account a myriad of factors.

It could take an

infinite number of reasonable formulas for determining in­

,

3

struction units

4

in educational needs; transportation, exceptional children,

5

guidance programs;, anything„

6

limitation which applied without regard to wealth, which was

7

reasonably related to the responsibility which each of the

8

local communities has , and if they have the same responsibility

9

it is our position that the state must give them the same tools

to take account of any reasonable difference

10

to meet that responsibility»

11

Q

12

Wall, can Florida pass a law that says no

county can tax for purposes more than 15 mills?

13
14

So that we wouldn't object to any

A

That, Your Honor, would depend on a number

of considerations

15

Q

Well, wouldn't it violate the —

16

A

I would violate —

— the United States Constitution?

18

A

It probably would, but I can't —

19

Q

Well, what article?

20

A

The considerations would be these, Your

22

Q

What would it violate, the 14th Amendment?

23

A

It -- yes, the —-

It says that all counties are on the same

basis, that violates the Equal Protection Clause?

A single tax rate —

It would violate the Equal Protection

It probably would, but there would be a

7

sibility of the community.,

8
9
10
11
12

Q

Let's put it this way: it wouldn’t be

unconstitutional on its face; would it?
A

It would be unconstitutional, given — if

it could be demonstrated it probably could —
Q

But on its face it says that each county

13

shall be treated equally.

Equal Protection Clause?

A

That, on its face, violates the

Your Honor, I respectfully disagree that

it’s equal on its face.

It's equal in that it says that same

number, flat tax rate is applicable, but I think the Court
must ask the question: how does this operate?

Does it operate

equally or unequally?
Let me, if I may, put a hypothetical.

Instead of

this case where we have the state giving to the local

.

.
f

communities tax authorisation, let’s consider the case where
the case was giving money for educational purposes and suppose
that the formula under which they distributed money was the
same as they distribute tax authority in this case, and suppose
5

1

that the State of Florida said that: we will give to each

2

county ten mills, a percentage of its tax base for educational

3

purposes»

4

would strike that down 9 to nothing»

5

ship to the educational tasks that the counties are required

6

to undertake»

Mow, there is no doubt in my mind that this Court
That has no relation­

Mow, the State of Florida, in its presentation

7
8

nor in its briefs, has suggested a single reason why an equal

9

limitation, if they want a limitation, why an equal limitation

!0

would not serve all of

its purposes.

The State suggested

11

yesterday that the Millage Rollback Act narrows the gap between

12

the poor counties and the rich counties.

I think it is

13

obviously true that it narrow's the potential gap.

14

say that if there is a limit of ten mills on each county the

15

16
17

potential gap is less than if there is a limitation of 15
mills and a limitation of 15 mills creates less of a potential
gap than no limitation at ail.
But, the question that we urge on the Court is

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

That is to

not the validity of the limitation; it's the validity of an
unequal wealth-related limitation expressed as a flat rate tax
limitation.
Q

I think we were told yesterday that there

was a pending action in the state court on this subject, with
other plaintiffs?
A

Are you familiar with that litigation?
I am familiar with it to the extent that I
6

?
2
3

4

have seen the pleadings and I have talked to counsel.
Q

What are the issues that are raised under

the State Constitution in that case?
A

The questions that are raised under the

5

State Constitution, Mr. Justice Brennan, are that the Millage

6

Rollback Act violates a provision of Florida law which says

7

that adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform

8

system of free public schools; another provision which says

9

that all natural persons are equal before the law and have in­

alienable rights and another provision which I think is even
weaker; it’s rather complicated.
But, ous? position —
Q

But I gather if those contentions were to

prevail under the State Constitution it wouldn't be necessary
for us, or any court to reach the Federal claims; would it?

That is correct, Your Honor.

Our position

here is that we are clearly under 1983 and we have a right to
come to a Federal forum with our Federal claim.
pressed only Federal claims.
Q
A
Q

We have

I believe the position that —

The fact that it's a 1983 action —
Pardon me?
The fact that, it's a 1983 suit would not

preclude, would it, in an appropriate case, abstention until
the State law questions were decided; would it?
A

Well, I believe that is the teaching in

7

1

Monroe v. Pape» as I read it, and the suggestion that a state

2

lav? issue or State Constitutional issue may be a ground for

3

abstention is rejected by this Court just last month in

4

Wisconsin against Constantineau, where Mr, Chief Justice Burger

5

dissenting, urged that —
Q

6

Well, I know, but whether or not — I'm

7

just asking: is the fact that it8s a 1983 action, in your sub™

8

mission, preclude abstention to have the —
A

9

I think it’s one of the grounds, Your

10

Honor,

I think there are several others.

11

don't thank that there is any ambiguity here in the statute

12

itself, in the Millags Rollback Act.

13

vagueness or other way that it can be interpreted that would

14

change the constitutional question here.

15

Moreover, I don’t —

16

Q

First of all, I

There is no conceivefoie

That's so, but however unambiguous, it may

17

nevertheless, nay it not, be unconstitutional on one of these

18

State Constitutional grounds?

19

A

I think that realistically speaking, of

20

course it hasn't been tested, but as a lawyer assessing a case

21

I would say that you would be filing all new grounds under the

22

Florida Constitution.

23

Q

Well, we weren’t.

24

A

25

The Florida courts would be.

No; as I say, I think a lawyer would be.
I don’t think that there is the
8

1

kind of guidelines existing in Florida Constitutional law —

z

Q

Incidentally, were any of these State

3

Constitutional grounds raised by the defense in this litiga­

4

tion?

A

Raised — no; they wouldn't foe raised in

I mean were they raised or —

They were not pressed by us»

thing conceivable in.

A

that was not before the

I think the only thing that was not before

the Three-Judge Court in Florida, Your Honor, is the argument

5

that this statute may possibly be justified on the ground that

easily met.

8

And that argument, I think, is very

The answer to it is: we have no objection to
your trying to narrow the gap; all we have objection to is that

10

you do by imposing an unequal wealth discrimination.

if

an analogy, I think, in tills case, to McLaughlin against

12

Florida in which Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe, wrote the

13

opinion, where there was an attempt by Florida, the same state,

14

to suppress extramarital promiscuity.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

15

16

There is

That was Mr. Justice White

in that opinion? and I wrote a concurring opinion.
MR. SHANKS:

17

Excuse me j I'm sorry, Your Honor.

18

In which the Court, indicated it was perfectly proper on the

19

State of Florida to do something about its extramarital or

20

premarital promiscuity, but they said "don’t do it by drawing

21

a racial line,!; and the analogy here is "that we have no objec­

22

tion to the State’s imposing a limitation, if that’s what they

23

want to do, but don’t do it by a wealth discriminating limita­

24

tion .

25

Q

Your argument has to go so far as to say

10

1

that a state may not limit the amount of educational support,

2

that is to ba derived from property taxes and substitute for

3

that support other revenue?

4

A

NO.

5

Q

Well, because the state says, look take

6

no more than 10 mills; don’t burden property owners any more

7

than ten mills for the board of education because we’re going

8
9

to make up the sums from other sources.
A

If they made up the sums from other sources.

10

In other words, suppose that a county says: all right, we

n

would normally — there is another county here that is raising

12

$150 a pupil, but the 10 mills in our county only raises $100

13
14
15

16

17
18

IS
20
21
22
23

24
25

a pupil and if we were free, if you treated us equally with the
other counties we would get raised $150.

If the state says:

we’ll make the $50 up to you so that you really are being
treated equally, that would be all right.

The only thing we

object to is Jhe unequal treatment.
Q

So, you’re saying that

thestate's

equalisation program isn't satisfactory.
A
Q

That’s correct.
And that this program they have of pouring

more money in and equalizing equal educational opportunities
still denies equal protection of the law.
A

That’s correct.

Q

Well, that’s — that really
11

then involves

1

the whole picture of all state support to education which, it

2

doesn't seem to me the District Court had before

3

A

Well, respectfully, Mr. Justice White, £

4

think it does not, because the only thing that is necessary to

5

examine is the MilXage Rollback Act to see whether it operates

6

equally and if it dees not, is there something which equalizes

7

the operation and the State hasn't pointed to anything which

8

equalises the operation.

9

All the STate has said is; well, we poured in more

10

money on a fair basis.

It

on a fair basis —

12

Q

Yes, they have poured in more money

It seems to me you would also haveto say

13

that the State,

14

to remove the taxing power from all counties and school dis­

15

tricts and the State itself assess and levy the property tax

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

it would be unconstitutional for the STate

and if it just levied the property tax at 10 mills right across
the board you wouldn' t say that that was unconstitutional?
A

No; no; that would be constitutional.

now how you get the money; it's how you give it back.

It's

In other

words if the State levied a 10 mill or 20 mill or 30 mill
property tax throughout Florida there would be nothing uncon­
stitutional about that.

What would be unconstitutional is if

it took that money and distributed it on the basis of wealth.
And here we're talking about — there's
difference, and I think it's important to maintain the
12

a big

1

distinction between getting the money in, wshther the state is

2

treating someone equally in the way of taxes from the taxpayer

3

point of view and on the other hand, whether the stats is

4

distributing its largess with benefits unequally here.

S

here we claim that the state is distributing its benefits un­

6

equally? not money, but in this case, according to tax.

7

think it is a discrete part of the taxing system in Florida,

8

and of course it could be met if Florida was to come in here

9

and say yes, it's true that it does operata unequally, but we

10

1?
12

have made it up by this.

IS
16

19

Q

24
25

Mr. Shanks, let me try once again; suppose

purposes of fire prevention.

Is there anything wrong with

that?
A

In that case, Mr. Justice Marshall,

property may be a measure of the need for fire prevention.
other words, there may be a? relationship

21

23

the --

Florida says that no county may tax more than 10 mills for

20

22

And they haven't come in and said

it's necessary to examine any more of

that and that’s why I don't think, Mr. Justice White, that

Q

How about police?

A

I don't know.

In

between —

S'ame answer?

We're getting into border­

But, if there is — in education there is demon­

strably no relationship between property and need.

WE have

shown in the record here that the top base varies between
$5,000 a pupil and $7,200 a, pupil, so that there's no
13

relationship whatever —
Q

Isn’t that true in most states?

A

That’s correcto

I want to go back to

something
Q

Do you go on the theory that each child in

the state is entitled to the exact same amount of money for
education?
A

No? not at all; not at all, and I’d like

to comment on that if I may, because "I think it’s important.
There are, as Your Honor noted yesterday, there
are variations in almost every state

I think Hawaii is the

only exception — between the rich districts and the poor dis­
tricts and that is because -Q

How could you possibly say that the

wealthiest group is the best one?
A

Well ~

Q

There is no such thing as absolutely —

A

And we are not urging equality.

All we are

urging is a negative proposition that you can’t discriminate
on the basis of wealth.

We don’t believe that a plaintiff

moots his case simply by showing, for example that; I’ve got a
school built five years ago and you’ve got a school built just
last year.

We say that the burden on the plaintiff is to

establish that there has been a discrimination — an invidious
discrimination on race or wealth and —
14

!

2

Q

Well, I'm still waiting for you to get to

that from your argument.

3

A

WE 11

4

Q

I must have missed something.

5

A

6

to explain it.

7

Q

I'm obviously deficient, myself, in trying
What I’m trying to say is that -I understood from the State that they put

8

in a certain amount of money per 27 children, or whatever it is

9

per unit in any county andthey deduct from that what the county

10

raises in its millage; is that right?

11

A

No.

12

Q

Wall, how does it operate?

A

The State —

Q

How does the Equalisation Fund operate?

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

The

Equalisation Fund operates in this

ways the State determines the total amount of an adequate
system by formula and there is one equalisation element x^hich
my brother Miner touched upon which works this way:

one

element of the total picture is they determine how much would
be raised by a four mills tax in the local taxing unit.

And

then there is an X figure up here and they take whatever is
raised by four mills the state will make up, up to X.
Q

That's what I thought and that's the way

I understand it.
A

That's right.
15

Nov/, between four and ten

1

the local district is free to add its own tax effort —

2

Q

Up to ten»

3

A

Up to ten, and that is where we say that

4

inevitably and necessarily andinequity, a discrimination by

5

wealth is built in, because we say to the one county: all

6

right, you can tax an additional six mills over the four and

7

whatever that is you can add it to your system and whatever --

8

given the fact chat there .is a wide variation in tax base for

9

people, the inevitable result is that in one county they can

10

add $400 or $500 per pupil and the other county is prevented

11

from doing the very same thing.

12

13
14

Q

Does the record show how many counties did

A

Yes, Your Honor.

add?
There are 24 counties.

15

I think it might be helpful if I call the Court’s attention to

16

the mcsfcimportant table in the case, which appears in the

17

Appendix at 25 and 26, and that is, unfortunately, a small

18

type, but it’s got a lot of numbers in it and it shows that

19

the 24 counties which, prior to the Mills Rollback Act, were

20

taxing up to 17 and 18 mills.

21

Q

Are they poor counties or rich counties?

22

A

They are ■—

23

Q

And when you are answering will you please

24
25

giveme your line as to what's poor and what's rich.
A

There is no line, Your Honor.
16

Everybody

1

below the richest man is poor in a relative sense•

In other

2

words, this is a discrimination by wealth»

3

state gives one county the authority to tax $700 and another

4

one $600, the one that’s getting $600 may be what we would

5

normally call a pretty well-to-do county —

When you — if the

6

Q

Well, aren’t they —

A

12

13

Well, aren’t they discriminated against in

I think we have to examine each, cases and

maybe in some of these eases something should be done about it,
Your Honor»

I’m trying to make a very narrow attack here on

a very clear discrimination that the statute imposes.

It

doesn't result from the fact that they are poor and can’t
afford it; they are willing to tax themselves at a higher rate»
They are willing to raise more money for their children, but
this statute prevents them from doing so,
Q

What you really mean is that some of the

taxpayers in those counties, have that view,
A

They cannot do what some of the taxpayers

in wealthier counties can do»

Q

May I ask you just one question, Mr.

5

Shanks, with reference to what Justice White and I were both

6

inquiring about*, as to what was before the District Court and

7

what was not.

e
9

In Mr. Miner's brief at pages» I think 11 and on­
ward, there are some figures that are certainly very interesting

10

and intriguing, but not very crucial to this case.

11

impression is that these figures were not beforethe District

12

Court; is that right?

13

A

Now, my

They were not before because they could

14

not be before them at the time because they occurred afterward,

15

and all they represent, Your Honor, is the additions that the

16

state has distributed to the counties on a fair basis and we

17

don't contest that; we acknowledge that the state has distribu­

18

ted funds to them on a fair basis and increased the funds.

19

only thing that we are talking and the only thing that we

20

Tha

attack, is that narrowed area above the basic state grant
which is a grant in authority to the counties to help themselves, and we say that grant of authority is an unequal one
because it's based on how rich you are.
Q

I had the impression that you agree that

— with Mr. Justice White's suggestion that if the state took
18

1

this entire operation over and eliminated the counties the

2

state could do precisely that*
A

3

You did.

Did I misunderstand you?

mills; that part was all right, the taxing part.

6

couldn’t taka that money and distribute it on the basis of

7

how rich the counties were.

S

example, you take sales and use tax where it gets most of the

9

money to support the public schools.

But it

It doesn’t distribute — for

It takes that sales and

10

use tax but it doesn’t give it back to the counties on the

11

basis of where the money came from; it has a formula which is

12

related to the educational needs of the varying kinds.

13

It

doesn’t matter whether 50 percent of it came from Dade County.

14

Dade County doesn’t get 50 percent; it gets it in terms of a

15

formula related to need and if the state taxed 10 mills on

16

real property that would be perfectly constitutional from the

17

taxpayer’s point of view and from the point of view of the

18

revenue-gathering it would be entirely unconstitutional, we

19

submit, for the state to take those funds and distribute it

20

back to the counties on the basis of how rich they are.
And, instead of taking money and giving it —

Yes, Mr. Justice Black.

Suppose that they had decided to abandon a state
school system and leave it up to each county to have the system

Could they do that?

What would

there be in the constitution to prohibit that?

case could be made —- I've got enough problems here without
making that case.
Well, I!m trying to find out —- it seems to

me like it would have a pretty close relationship —

No, it doesn't. Your Honor, for this reason:

in the case where the state says we're not going to do anything.
The localities can do whatever they want —

The difficulty

crucial to an understanding of the case I’m trying to make.

The difficulty that the poor counties have in the case here in

That's equal and I don't see anything un­
I think it would be very foolish and unwise?

10

but if they authorise the localities it can be argued that they

11

are discriminating on the basis of an ability to pay and the

12

poor ones can't afford it.

13

14

I’m willing to assume for the purposes of this case that it is
all right, they can't say, for example, if they abolish all
schools and leave it up to the locality, they can't say to the
rich locality: well, you can have a school with $1500 a pupil
in it and say to the poor county; you're poor and for that
reason we won't let you have a $1500 school system.

22

25

We will

only let you have a $500 school system.

as the rich, even if the poor are willing to sacrifice to do

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES E. MINER, JR,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

4

MR. MINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;

6

I must confess in all candor thatthe first time

7

that I read the pleadings in this case and the arguments in

8

Mr. Shank's brief I did not then understand how or if Florida

9

wast in fact, discriminating against the school children.

10

II

I

still do not.
The whole underlying concept of the minimum

12

foundation funding formula in Florida is a recognition of the

13

socio-economic fact that some of Florida's counties are poor

14

in relation to the student numbers and some are wealthy.

15

go in and with the minimum foundation funding formula a com­

16

plex series of statutes, we recognise that some counties can

17

not fend for themselves and we are going to see that they at

18

least can give their children a minimum acceptable education.

IS

Mr. Shanks; has indicated this morning that he is

We

20

focusing on a narrow — that he's making a narrow argument.

21

don't think that we can judge whether or not Florida, is in

22

fact, discriminating against its school children without look­

23

ing at the total concept of the minimum foundation program.

24

Mr. Shanks has indicated in his brief and in

25

argument -that several of Florida's counties: 16, I think,
23

I

1

suffered in excess of fifty millions ©f dollars lost because

2

of the — the Millage Rollback Act was enacted»

3

in fact, when you consider the infusion of state monies to

4

make up for those monies that were lost there is an increase ir

excess of $112 million»

So, the counties have not suffered as a result of
the Millage Rollback Act.
I would urge the Court to determine whether or
not we in Florida are discriminating against our school child­
ren in our poor counties, in fact and not in theory.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Miner.

Thank you, Mr. Shanks.
The case is submitted.
