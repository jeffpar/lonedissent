ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR# FRIEDMAN:

8

the Court.

Mr# Chief Justice and may it please

This case, hdere on a writ of certiorari to the

Fifth Circuit# presents an important question as to the evi­
10

dence that may be utilised by the Secretary of Health,

II

Education, and Welfare in disability proceedings under the

12

Social Security Act.

13

Specifically, the question is the correctness of a

14

ruling toy the court of appeals that written reports made by

IS

doctors following the examination of a patient which reflect

18

the results of the examination and the doctor's analysis and

17

conclusions based upon that examination cannot constitute sub­

18

stantial evidence to support a determination of disability if,

1

one, at the hearing before the Social Security authorities the

20

claimant objects to the introduction of this evidence? and,

21

two, if these written doctors'1 reports are contradicted by

ZZ

oral testimony given at the hearing by the claimant and the

23

claimant's doctor,

24

'The government has brought this case to the Court

2S

because of the serious adverse impact it believes this rule

happened perhaps in this ease.

21

ability in April 1966 in which he claimed that he had become

22

disabled in September of 1965 as a result ©£ a bade injury.

23

Before he had actually filed his claim he had undergone seme

24

treatment which had been unsuccessful, and when he filed Ms

25

claim under the procedures, the statutory procedures,

This man filed a claim for dis­

3

the

1

claim was referred by the Social Security agency to the state

2

agency that handles disability problems* in this case the Tessas

agency.

4

to enter into agreements with state agencies to handle and pro­

S

cess these claims originally.

Under the statute* the statute authorises the Secretary

Q

The state agency then --

Do the procedures by which they are handled

differ* depending upon the state?
A

Well, they may vary seme but the basic procedure

.1 fchinK is the same.. The state agency makes whatever examina­

10

tions necessary.

11

sends a man out for medical examinations; in this case there

12

was a series of examinations by four different doctors.

13

The federal government pays for these but it

First they sent the man to an orthopedic surgeon who

14

conducted various tests.

15

Following that* they also had* 1 might mention,, before this —-

16

they also attached to his application the various reports from

17

his doctors which indicated the problems they saw.

18

earlier stage* an earlier stage before he filed his claim* he

19

had undergone surgery* something called a laminectomy, for the

20

pairs he had in his lower bach.

2!
22

0

Then they sent him to a neurologist.

Would you explain there a little bit?

And at an

Fe did

have surgery?

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

In other words ~~

25

A

May I give the chronology of what happened to
4

1

him --

2
3

Q

And was there any curative effect as a result ©f

the laminectomy?

4

A

Apparently not.

Apparently not.

He was twice

S

hospitalised by the orthopedic surgeon, then the laminectomy

6

was performed,, and following this he went from seeing the -ortho­

7

pedic surgeon, he consulted his family doctor, Dr. Morales, who

8

undertook to treat him.
Q

9

Do you know whether the surgery was performed by

10

an orthopedist or a neurosurgeon or by both?

1!

show this?

12
13

h

Does the record

X believe he was a neurosurgeon.

It is a

doctor --

14

Q

And 1 take it they found pathology but no ~~

15

A

Well, they didn’t find much pathology.

This is

16

one of the points.

They found some pressure and he prescribed

17

certain procedures, but they did not find any specific neuro­

18

logical involvement of the kind that they believed would cause

19

this pain.

20

Before the operation, the neurologist, Dr. Mimslow.

21

believed there was seme problem with the disc, but apparently

22

the laminectomy did not disclose that fact.

23
24
25

Q

Well, did preoperative diagnosis through x-rays

or other means disclose the presence of pathology?
A

There was enough there apparently to suggest it.
5

1

They performed two myelograms before the surgery and the first

2

one is not in the record* the second one suggested some disc

3

involvement* but apparently after the surgery was performed

4

they did net find anything which indicated disc involvement.

S

And after that the man was taken — put himself in the care of

6

Dr. .Morales* a family doctor* who treated him more conserva­

7

tively with such things as heat* he gave him some x-ray -- net

8

34»ray* deep-heat therapy*

9

killers* some slight exercises and s© forth.

10

he gave him drugs* he gave him pain
Hone of these

conditions* these treatments apparently alleviated his pain.

11

Now, if 1 may just go back for a minute to what' hap­

tz

pened in the case after the state agency had examinee? the wan.

13

The state agency then initially at least decided that he was

14

not disabled and subsequent to that he then said he wished to

IS

appear that'to the Socia

16

state agency makes -the initial determination* which they are

n

permitted to do under the statute* the case then goes back to

18

the Bureau of Old Age and Disability Insurance at the Social

19

Security Administration* which makes --

Would you stop there* Mr. Friedman.

After the

If the stats

21

agency found that indeed he was disabled* would that be the end

22

of the case so far as Social Security?

23

A

Probably.

Probably.

Mostly I think in almost

24

every instance the state agency finds the man is disabled* the

23

Social Security Administration —
6

1

Q

And here they £©sand he was not?

2

A

He was not.

3

Q

Then what is the procedure after that?

4

A

Well, then at this point it then q©es t© the

S

Social Security Administration, and they wrote him a letter,

8

which is pretty much of a form letter, saying that the examin­

1

ation has been conducted and you are found not disabled.

©

then they said you have a certain period within which to apply

9

for reconsideration, and he applied for reconsideration.

10

And

And

after he had applied for reconsideration --

1!

Q

Reconsideration by whom?

12

A

By the Social Security Adminiat ration, by the

13

Bureau of Disability —

Q

The state agency is now out?

15

A

The state agency is out.

But following that,

16

following that and before he

17

reconsideration was deni'3d and then he was told he had the

18

right to request a hearing and he requested a hearing.

19

well, then what happened is

How, between that period and before the hearing, he

underwent a further examination.

A

Oh, yes.

25

9

2?

pedics?

11

1

A

Yes, Your Honor.

And he just advised basically,

2

advised the examiner as to what the reports showed and what

3

the significance was.

4

the examiner9s' conclusion was that these reports that had been

S

presented and the evidence produced at the hearing indicated

6

that Mr. Perales had a low back syndrome of mild significance

7

— mild severity, excuse me.

8
9

Mow, he concluded, where he told --

That is what he said.

The examiner denied the claim.

He said that on all

the evidence he concluded that that was basically what the man

10

had0 was a low back syndrome of mild significance, and also

n

relying on certain statements made, by the psychiatrists and

12

neurologists that there was an emotional overlay to this ill­

13

ness and that neither of these factors individually or in

14

combination constituted disability.

IS

Then under the practice, Perales brought suit in the

IS

district court, which set aside the determination.

17

say that there was a further step in the interim proceedings.

18

He sought review of the examiner's decision by something

19

called the Appeals Council, and the Appeals Council upheld the

20

examiner's decision and under the statute that then became

21

the final decision.

22
23
24
25

Q

1 might

Does the Appeals Council hear argument or do

they just hear the appeal on the record?
A

In this case they didn't hear argument.

On oc­

casions they do hear argument,but in roost instances it is just
12

!

done on the record.

2

don111 believe that briefs were filed in this ease.

3

However, briefs are sometimes filed.

I

The district court said that the statements, the

4

written reports of the medical advisors were not substantial

5

evidence, and that the testimony of the medical advisor was of

6

little or no''probative value, and therefore the district court

7

remanded the case to the Secretary to hold a new hearing before

e

a different examiner.

9

cause the district judge a month before this hearing had con­

He said that this examiner was out be­

?o

demned the use of these medical reports and, despite that,

?i

this examiner had admitted them, so he said it bad to be before

12

a new hearing and the indication clearly was that the new

'S3

hearing only the doctors' testimony would be permitted, not the

14

reports unless the parties.agreed t© it.

15

How, the Fifth Circuit affirmed, and what the Fifth

16

Circuit said basically I think was four things:

17

Fifth Circuit said that in view of a provision in the statute

18

that the rules of evidence shall not be binding upon the

19

Secretary -in these proceedings, that the medical reports, al­

20

though hearsay, were admissible.

21

the court of appeals said.

22

First, the

That was the first thing

Secondly, the court of appeals said that since under

23

the regulations a claimant has the right to request to subpoena

24

witnesses and since Perales had never sought to subpoena the

m

doctors, he could not complain that he was denied the right t&
13

1

cross «-examiner the doctors because he hadn’t sought to attempt

2

to do so „
Q

3
4
5

Is that an absolute right to subpoena,, Mr*

Friedman?
A

.No, it is not an absolute right.

In effect, you

6

have to show good cause, and the practice is that if a man can

7

show some reason why it is necessary to call the doctor fco the

8

stand -- for example, he would say that you just can’t tell ©n

9

the basis of these tests alone what his condition is, the

10

significance of the tests depends upon the circumstances under

II

which they were done, how long you have, @t cetera, et cetera

12

— but they will not permit him to subpoena a doctor merely

13

because he says he wants to cross-examine.

14
15
16

Q

And the further point was that he hadn’t even

tried in the past?
A

He hadn’t even tried.

.

He hadn’t even tried.

■*

17

And then they went ©n„ however, and said that despite that

18

nevertheless because the'doctors0 statements were uncorroborated

19

hearsay, that could not eonsisfcute substantial evidence, where

20

the claimant objected to the introduction of the reports and

21

the reports were contradicted by the claimant's testimony and

22

by the doctor’s testimony.

23

The court also said it agreed that the medical ad­

2A

visor had properly been permitted to testify, that once again

25

hie testimony was properly admitted, even though he said it
14

1

was hearsay because it was built in turn on the reports, but

2

the court then went on and criticised what it said was viewed

3

as the widespread practice of these medical advisors, it called

4

riding the circuit with the examiners for the purpose of

S

reporting on the condition on the basis of reports and so on,

6

and the court said this procedure should be frowned upon if not

7

eliminated entirely»

e
9

Mow

and it therefore affirmed the district court0s
-

decision.,

V

1 want to stress* before gefcfc ing into the dis­

10

cussion of merits of the case that neither ecus-1 in this case

11

has yet passed upon the question whether or not the Secretary

12

correctly held Perales was not disabled.

13

was that the evidence upon which the Secretary based its de­

14

cision was-, not ’ substantial evidence.

15

case* we don't teow in this case what the ultimate outcome

16

will be, and if the court agrees with the' government that the

17

court of appeals applied the wrong standard, all that we ask

13

is that the case be sent back to the district court for the

1©

district court now to review the substantiality of the evidence

2©

upon which the Secretary based his determination.

21

22

All they had said

We don’t Know in this

I make this point because soma of the amici in their
.

briefs are complaining that this man wasn't disabled and that

23

on this evidence you had to conclude that he was not disabled

24

because these tests were basically unreliable.

25

issue that hes not been passed upon by either of the two lower
15

That is an

1

courts.

2

Now* Z would line,

if I way,

just briefly to indicate

3

the importance of the issue before coming to the discussion as

4

to the question of substantial evidence.

As 2 have indicated

/

5

earlier in'my argument, there are about 20,30© »- 27,00© last

6

year of these hearings held annually, and since the program

7

has been in effect we have always relied on these reports.

S
9

Mow, the doctors have been very cooperative in these
cases.

They have been quit© willing to examine the people,,

10

presumably knowing that it is only going to be an unusual ease

11

when they will be asked to testify.

12

information which we have set forth in ©ur brief that if this

13

rule is obtained and if as a necessary result there is going to

14

have to be a great deal more testifying by the doctors,

15

lot of doctors who have hitherto been willing to conduct these

16

examinations are going to be very* very reluctant to do so

17

because they know they examine a man and spend an hour ©r two

18

making tests on him and so forth, and the

19

may be that several months later they will find themselves

20

forced to attend a hearing at some distant place, perhaps

21

have to sit 'for a whole day giving -- listening to fcPre testi­

22

mony and then giving their testimony.

And fcb© Secretary has some

that a

end result of this

>

23

Mow,

not only will this make -- and this reluctance

24

on the part of doctors to conduct these examinations would

25

have two unfortunate consequences*

16

First,

it would make it

1

more difficult for the Secretary to determine this vast number

z

of claims and* secondly„ in the long ran we think it would re­

3

dound fco the detriment of the claimants themselves because the

4

majority of these cases in which claims are made following

S

these examinations the claim is allowed, and figures .show

6

roughly tw©«thirds of all claims are allowed without ever go­

7

ing to hearing.

'8

9

So that the claimants themselves might be

handicapped if the doctor© were generally unwilling and reluc­
tant to conduct these examinations,

~

And finally we read, in the papers all the time about

10
11

the critical shortage of physicians in this country today»

12

think 50*000 more are needed.

13

60 hours a \vTeek and they don’t have enough time fco s.ee

14

patients*

15

these reports are thoroughly reliable and that really it would

16

not be in .the public interest that the doctors should spend a

17

substantial portion, of■their time, particularly the specialists

!8

who I presume are even in more critical short supply, testify­

IS

ing at these hearings.

Let me put it this way:

Are there instances in

which notwithstanding reports as unfavorable to the disability

14

how7 many cases nevertheless result in findings of disability?
A

15

Well, we do find

we d© have statistics that

16

show that roughly one-third of all the cases that g© to hear­

17

ing result in findings of non-disability.

18

in our brief for about two years ago, that there were- roughly

20c000 hearings in that year, and I think 6,900 of the cases

Q

16

Mow, the examiner rejected that.
Well, X gather no matter how many experts he may

18

nevertheless the government's position would be if the examiner

finds there is not, these reports constitute substantial evi­

Q

That is

And I suppose arguably that if the government

called doctors, their own doctors, who had made these reports

at every hearing, there might be fewer awards of disability?

A

There might be.

Q

Well, there would be then personal confrontation

A

Which 1 think would be unfortunate certainly.

21

But I also suggest that there might be fewer awards of dis­

ability for another reason, Mr. Justice, is the difficulty of

28

getting the doctors to make the examinations.

24
23

Q

Now, Mr. Friedman, you mentioned that there

were 20,000 hearings last year and 6,900 were favorable to the
23

claimant after hearing.

2

as to how many grants in favor of the claimants were made

«3

without going to hearing?

4

A

Do you have any figures in this record

Yes, we have a figure on that.

It is about 540,. GOO or 560.000.

It is rather

rough.

It is roughly two-

6

thirds of all applications -- I can give you the figure in a

resulted in awards to the claimant.

The

18

doctors generally are not called,

19

frequently happens, as I have indicated, the procedures are

20

quite informal and what sometimes happens is if the claimant

21

indicates he would like to have a doctor and gives the reasons

22

for it without a formal subpoena being issued, the examine**

23

has someone get in touch with the doctor and arranges for the

ARGUMENT OF RICHARD TINSMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TINSMAN:
Court.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

The primary issue to be decided here is this limited

one where each side has directly contrary evidence on the
crucial issue to be decided in this particular case, disability
27

1

of the claimant, and it is directly in conflict what procedure

2

should be followed* the one that the circuit has mandated, where

«2*

the government must bring in their doctors, their evidence, or

4

the one that has been followed in the past.

5

And just

Mr. Justice Brennan indicated, this is

6

not an adversary procedure* this is the position that has been

7

fca&an by the government* but of its very nature this is an

©

adversary procedure because the government on the one hand has

9

reports that say this man is not disabled? the man says those

10

reports are wrong, I am disabled, and my doctor says I am dis­

12

So we really can't characterize this as not an adver­

13

sary proceeding.

14

a disability hearing where there are two doctors who are di­

15

Of its very nature, it must be because it is

rectly in conflict.

And the problem in Social Security hear­

16

ings is there must be total and complete disability, not as in

17

some programs, veterans programs, where there may be partial

18

disability.
How, we start out with the basic proposition that has

19

20

been enunciated by this Court in numerous decisions that say

21

-- they are all cited by the Fifth Circuit, one of them is

Consolidated Edison vs. National Labor Relations Board, and it

Is that the gist of your complaint about the

hearsay evidence?

5

2\

We actually have three points that I would like

6

to bring out, Mr. Justice Black.

7

most primary one that the Fifth Circuit decided on — is that

the hearsay reports ©re not substantia] evidence and they

9

should not be allowed to be so.

First is that — and the

The second point that we make in the argument is this

medical advisor situation, where the man has never examined the

roan,

13

have made in our brief is that the whole procedure that is

14

presently followed by Social Security violates due process in

that the hearing examiner is both the government attorney and

finder,

is improper; and the third point that we will make and

and he is not an impartial fact­

as has been required by the court in past situations.

IS

I would like to first —

19

Q

20
21

Could you argue that in suits against the govern­

ment where it is consented to be sued?
A

No, because generally in suits where the govern­

22

ment has consented to be sued we have an impartial fact-finder

23

and that is the federal district judge.

24

Q

That is what this is,

No,

Your Honor,

isn't it?
in a suit --

Q

Isn't this a suit against the government?

2

&

Yes, sir, but the hearing examiner must be the

3

government's lawyer as well as the judge.

4

government's lawyer hat and then after he introduced the govern­

S

ment's evidence he rules on objections of the claimant's

6

attorney or the claimant, then he puts on his judge hat, and

7

it is difficult to determine where he stops being the govern­

8

ment's lawyer who must assimulate all of this evidence, and

9

becomes the impartial fact-finder.

He first puts on the

In the federal court claim case, of course, the judge
does not assimulate the evidence.

Can you subject the government to the same Kind

is on 24.

It

It is Wong Yang Sung vs. McGrath and virtually the

4

identical procedure was followed in that case as is followed

5

in Social Security hearings where the government hearing of­

6

ficer gathers the evidence for the government, then listens to

7

the evidence he gathers and listens to the immigrant in that

3

case, and then decides whether or not he should be deported.

9

Here the hearing examiner gathers the evidence for

10

the government, arranges for which witnesses he will call and

n

then he just simply decides whether or not he is going to be­

12

lieve the evidence that he gathers or whether he is going to

13

believe the evidence that the claimant puts on.

14

problem is particularly poignant in cases such as this, where

15

the evidence is directly conflicting and much of the evidence

relied on by the hearing examiner in this case was by evidence

from the insurance company doctor.

judicial process.

Q

That was

Well, was your first point really the same as a

7

charge that the government had provided that hearings could

8

have hearsay evidence, you would say that is unconstitutional?

D

A

We say, Your Honor, when there is basically un­

10

fair, and that this Court has held it, in cases where there is

11

direct conflicts in the crucial issue to toe decided, and it is

S2

an issue which gives rights or denies rights to the individual,

13

that he is entitled under the Constitution to a fair hearing

J4

and this Court has held that a fair hearing requires confronta­

15

tion and cross-examination.

Do you mean by that in this instance -- I gather

Yes, sir, we definitely --

do you think that you would be able to shake them down and

and it is our position in response to

that ----

33

1

Q

Well* do you think the proper way fco contradict

the medical testimony is by your cross-examination and it

could be done by contrary affidavits?

4

A

Your Honor, I would say this to you, it has been

5

ray experience ~~ and I am a trial lawyer who is the plaintiff’s

6

lawyer -- that in many cases, one is this example, that when

7

the doctors have to come and testify, not only sometimes it

8

isn’t a question of shaking their testimony, but showing their

9

bias and making their position look ridiculous.

10

For example* the medical advisor in this particular

case, Eir. Leavitt, testified on the record that he would con­

12

sider no person in this country disabled even

Q

II

Well, is the administrative determination sub­

ject to judicial review!

12

A

?3

Yes, sir, it is, but only under the substantial

14

evidence rule, and 1 think this is another significant thing,

15

is 3.2 percent of the awards which have been appealed under

16

the substantial evidence rule have been sent back, which means

17

that the courts found there was no evidence —

Oh, not necessarily.

It is our opinion, it was our judgment at least

that once we made our case, it is not our burden to disprove

the government' s case,

In effect, that is what we are being

2 i asked to do.
Q

You feel yon made your case with the general

4

practitioner's testimony on as an elusive a subject as back

5 i

injury?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

How was the injury incurred in this case?

8

A

This man was picking up a bundle of shingles,

Your Honor, and -■*» he was a true kdriver and unloading seme

9

shingles, he picked up a bundle and injured his back.

10
11

Q

And has he worked at all since then?

12

A

Ho he has not.

In fact, it shows in the record

13

only in his application t© proceed in formal pauperous,

14

one year after this hearing this man had a back fusion, which

15

means all of these doctors who said there was nothing wrong

16

with him were found to be wrong and the general practitioner,

17

who testified that he %<©s disabled and there was something

IS

there even though he had no objective evidence, was subse-

19 |j quehfcly prot^en correct.

Q

20

How let me trade you down on that.

There was
.

.21

something wrong with him because he had a fusion, is that what

22

you are —*
A

23

In other words, the doctor would not have done

a fusion unless he found that there was some problem in his

24

back that required this fusion.

2

Q

in some way, knowing he had a fusion.

3
4

Well, he might have felt it might help this man

A

Well, the doctor obviously would not have done

a fusion if he felt the man did not need it. Your Honor.

5

Q

Well, he was in there, he was in the back --

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

-- and many times, do they not make a fusion

If has been my experience, at least in the trial

anyway?

10

practice, and I have tried many back cases, that a fusion is

11

done only as a last resort when you cannot eliminate the pain

12

by any other method.

13

Q

Did it eliminate his pain?

A

This man has had less pain but he is still -—

Q

This accident happened in 1965.

What does the third-grade education have to do

with his pain?
A

Well,many people can

for example, a lawyer

can work with; pain, or an accountant, even though he has

21

back pain, can perform labor.

22

only asset is his back is one who if he has a great deal of

23

pain in his back cannot continue to earn a living.

But a laboring man whose really

is done, a spinal fusion is done, that proves that it should

No* sir.

We are saying that there was some-

3

thing wrong with this man's back at the time that all of the

specialists said this was just of a mild severity and that he

could go to work.

e

Q

Well* this isn't in the record anyway, is it?

This is not in the record and we simply mention

it because these questions were brought up.

Well* the doctors that we had said it was a back

sprain.

I have not gone in and -- actually* after the

13

Workmen°s Compensation proceeding that was tried where he was

14

granted total disability, 1 have not gone in and followed the

13

medical records that closely because that would have to be re­

it was held that he had a back sprain.

18

that the pain was so severe that he could not work.

You have made the point that there should be an

2

A

Yes, sir.

«u*

Q

Does this record contain any estimate as to how

4

many hearing examiners it would take fco handle the 20,000

5

hearings?
A

6

In an article cited in the amicus brief in the

7

Mississippi Law Journal, it states at the present time there

8

are approximately 200 examiners in the United States, each of

9

whom hear.an average of 8 to 10 cases per month.
Q

10

Well* are you suggesting that we apply that to

11

figure out how many hearing examiners we would need to hear

12

these 20,000 cases?
A

13

Well, those hearing examiners now hear these

14

20,000 cases. Your Honor.,

15

make these hearing examiners independent and do just like is

16

done in the longshoremen's cases and make the government

17

attorney come in and present the government evidence.
Q

18

All we are saying is that we should

Then it doesn't make any difference.

You nave

got to get some more people fco take the place of those bodies.

20

You would have to get some lawyers to do what the hearing

21

examiner now does for the Social Security department, wouldn't

22

you?

23

A

Yea, sir, that is correct.

24

Q

But if they stayed on as lawyers, is there any

25

figure as to how many examiners you would need, how many —
39

1

A

No,

In other words, we don't see that they

sir.

2

would need any more examiners.

they could use members from the U.S. Attorneys Office,

than allowing the governmenffs lawyer who has gathered the

13

government's evidence to be the hearing examiner and the inde­

13

pendent man.

14

Q

But it is really not any more ridiculous

i^ssume that you put on government lawyers at

each one of those hearings, then the next request would be to

insist that each one of the applicants have a lawyer to repre­

17

sent them, paid for by the government.

10

A

Sot necessarily.

Your Honor.

19

Q

Why not?

20

A

Well, the reason is that this is not such a

in other words,

32

such a fundamental right that you are required to have counsel,

23

although HEW has pilot programs around the country where they

24

are providing attorneys for all Social Security claimants.

Q

All right.

20

A

Well,

21

Q

Does he cross-examine or does he examine?

22

A

Well,

19

Yes,

sir.
What else does he do other than to

hear —
he cross-examines the claimant,

he --

I think if you look at the record in this

23

case. Your Honor, you will find that really he cross-examines

24

the claimant and almost takes an adversary attitude.

25

Q

Well,

suppose I find that he didn't cross-examine,

then what would you say?

Q

this completely and satisfy you.

14

A

What we ask is ws ask that there be an impartial

15

fact-finder which Mr. Justice Brennan says has to be essential

16

in Goldberg.

17

Q

Like a jury?

18

A

Ho,

sir.

A hearing examiner can be an impartial

19

fact-finder but not one who is required to gather all of the

20

government's evidence.

21

Q

Wait a minute now.

Again I say what is all of

22

the government's evidence, it is reports of these doctors.

23

that all of it?

24
25

A

SJo,

Is

he can gather other evidence such as evidenc

of —

42

1

Q

Well* how about in this case?

2

A

In this case he went out and subpoenaed in the

3

evidence of fellow employees, he brought in the medical advisor

4

and this is all that he did in this case.

5

Q

Right.

6

A

What we are asking

Q

8

A

That's right.

Q

And he says you look over this at your expertise

All he got in this ease was the medical advisor.

10

and give me your impression of it, which I can take or leave,

11

is that right?

12

That is correct.

Your Honor.

Q

How, how do you extendall of

Your Honor.

He had —

all of the records of the insurance company doctors as well.

Did he go out and get them?

21

A

Well, he had members of his staff go and obtain

22

them, yes, sir.

25

I assume.

So if wasn't him?
Well, his staff was acting under his direction,

Actually the type of hearing we are asking for has
43

been provided under the Longshoremen’s Act for a number of

2

years where there is an independent fact-finder, the govern­

4

depending on whether they are insured or not, and the claimant

lawyer presents evidence.

done that way everywhere else?

And therefore it is unconstitutional — is it

Q

Your reference to the Goldberg case confuses me

a little bit.

Yes,

sir.

In that the hearing officers were not totally

independent and it wasn’t a total adversary due process.

17

A

Well, Your Honor, what the government itself

18

says when it comes to other cases where the poor people aren't

19

involved really doesn't rely on this concept of inherent v*iaht~

20

ness of the doctor's reports; in cases involving the ’'evocation

of a pilot's license,

job may be at stake,

z

seen to take the position when there are a lot of cases and

3

where poor people are involved, we have one standard * and where

4

there are few cases and more affluent people involved., we have

5

a different standard.

6

Basically,

And so the government is

the Solicitor General took the position

7

that it really doesn't make any difference that the doctor is

8

just going to get up and read his report and that is all there

9

is to it; where, as a member of the trial bar and have tried a

10

number of cases, I will say to you that in my opinion this is

11

the real key,

12

you can van or lose your case, as to whether you can cross-

13

examine the doctors who are relied upon by the government.

this makes a tremendous difference as to whether

14

Many doctors,

15

Q

16

Well,

for example, we see --

if it makes that much difference, why

didn't you call the doctor?
A

17

Because it is our position first a practical

18

matter,

19

You recall the government doctor gets paid $125.

to subpoena a doctor without paying him

23

Q

I thought the government would pay him.

24

A

They pay him the $20 witness fee,

25

If

Your Honor,

and nothing more, not any stipend like they pay their own

And so what we are faced with if we have to call their

he has.

Well, would you have any real objection here if

the government said to you, loose, we give you your choice, you

12

can either get a subpoena out to the doctor or not, now you

13

have got your choice of either -- we w.113 use either the report

14

or the doctor, whichever one you prefer, but we are going to --

I mean that happens to be the rule, and you just don’t happen

16

to cal] a doctor at that time.

18

you take that position, Mr. Justice White, is that we are not

19

only having to prove our case but then once the government

20

simply puts in a report we have to go forward and disprove the

21

government's case, and that --

22

Q

Well, that is a different point.

But on the

23

point you were making, would you have any real complaint if the

24

government says you just tell us which you want, the report <Sr

Yes,

sir, because we have found,

Mr. Justice

8

White, it has been my experience that we have found that many

9

of these doctors in their reports will say this man has a 20

total disability.

I think if the

they just simply take the claimant’s doctor’s report and dis­

25

Q

Was it his own physician who indicated that

there was so psychosomatic involvement here?

His own physician indicated that there was an

4

emotional overlay, and this together,

s

prior to the injury he was able to go out and earn a living,

s

even with the pre-existing emotional overlay, but with the

7

back condition that he had and the emotional overlay that he

8

had partly brought on by his destitute circumstances,

9

Social Security said you cannot even apply until you have been

10

unemployed for six months, and in this case the hearing wasn’t

11

had until he had been out of work for over a year and a half.

12

these two factors,

and

So generally these people are pretty destitute by the

13

time they get to a hearing examiner, and anyone who has been

14

out of work for a year and a half is going to have some emo­

15

tional overlay.

16

Q

Mr. Tinsman, what would you say if instead of

17

calling these -- using these panels of doctors,

18

if these matters were referred to the panel of specialists to

act as triers and let them make the decision?

expect that you could cross-examine a hearing officer, would

times select doctors who, because they are attempting to hold

dowr the costs of their own disability programs, are generally

very conservative and are hesitant to find disability in a man,

That's right/because we take the position that

Suppose Congress passed a law providing these

Well, I think, Your Honor, that if we really

20

feel that what Mr. Justice Brennan said in Goldberg is that —

21

in almost every setting where important decisions turn on

22

questions of fact -- due process requires an opportunity to

23

confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, that this would

24

be highly suspect as a violation of due process, that Congress

cannot provide this.

ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

13

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right at the outset, I t^ould just

14

make two little factual points.

15

cussion over the role of the examiner in this case, I want to

16

make it clear, these examiners are appointed under the

17

Administrative Procedure Act.

m

ers who preside at normal agency hearings. ' They are not under

19

the control of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

20

They are Independent examiners.

21

First, in the previous dis­

They are the typical APA examin­

Now, on another point that was made, I have been

22

advised by the Social Security people that if

23

subpoenaed at the request of the claimant, the government will

24

pay a reasonable fee for his appearance.

25

if a request is made to examine the file prior to the hearing,
64

I am also told that

15

1

and if the hearing examineris office is 200 or 250 miles away,

£

arrangements can be made to temporarily send the file to a

3

local place where the man is so that the claimant or his

4

attorney can examine it.

3

Now,

finally,

I think it is important to note two

6

aspects of the case.

7

it seems to me that basically what the medical examinee's doina

8

in this case is pretty much the same tbina --

First, on the medical examiner Fs testimony,

9

Q

Adviser,

you mean?

Pardon?

19

reports that had been presented and then to summarise what had

20

been testified to at the hearing,

21

22

What the medical adviser is doing in this case is what
expert witness is doing,

the only difference is in the

And I take it if in this

there would be no objection

This is an informal administrative proceeding.
Now,

the charge has been made here that the examiner

1!

was unfair, that this whole proceeding is unfair, and there

12

are references to the statement of the need for cross-

13

examination and so on.

14

Q

Does the statute use the word "unfair"?

15

A

No,

no.

The statute. Your Honor,

says that the

16

Secretary shall -- it says the Secretary shall have full power

17

to make rules and regulations and shall adopt reasonable rules

13

and regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and

19

extent of the proof and the evidence and the method of taking

20

and furnishing the same.

21

Secretary has adopted regulations which give the examiner

22

broad authority to conduct the hearing as he sees fit, and it

23

says that it is within the discretion of the examiner to deter­

24

mine the procedures as hearing examiner provided it is in such

25

nature as to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity for a

And then under that statute the

66

j

1

2

xu

fair hearing.
We think that has been given, and we think the fair­

3

ness of this is demonstrated by the fact that in at least a

4

third of these cases the claimant prevails after the hearinq.

5

And I suppose in many instances it may be that when the examine r

6

receives the claimant before him. he gets a different view of

7

the examiner's judgment as to what the reports show and what

8

their significance is.

9

10

Mr. Friedman,

cases a full-time job for these examiners?

11

A

Yes,

this is a --
