MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

'International Onion of Operating Engineers.

Mr. Ordman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD ©ROMAN,

7

©N BEHALF OF THE NLRB

MR, ORDMANs

ESQ.„

Mr, Chief Justice, may it pleas© the

Court, these two eases consolidated here ©re here on writs of
certiorari from the Court ef Appeals for the Third Circuit.
In broad terms, the questions presented in both of
these cases is whether the union, 'Local 325 of the Operating
f

13

Engineers, violated section 8(bH4f (Bf of the National Labor

14

Relations Act, the so-called secondary boycott provision, by

15

exerting coercive pressures upon neutral employers who sup­

16

ported its dispute with the primary employer, the white

1?

Construction' Company.

18

Now, that question can be further refined.

All

19

parties and the Board' and th® court below are in agreement

20

here that the union did exert coercive pressures as defined by

21

section 8.(b) (4}(B) *ap©n neutral employers.

22

tory section further requires for purposes relevant here that

23

such coercive conduct have as an abject forcing or requiring

24

an employer to cease doing business with any other person.

2§

Now, that statu­

Now, this is the pivotal issue in the case.
3

The

i

Board found that the union's coercive conduct had cessation of

2

business as it read the statute, in a statutory sense, as an

3

object of its conduct, and the Board therefore found the viola­

4

tion of section 8(b)(4)(B).

S

The court below disagreed.

Unlike the Board and unlike other courts of appeals

6

which considered this issue, the court below reads the language

7

in the statute quite literally.

8

reading, the. court below held that the proof was insufficient

B

to prove that the union had an object to -- to have a cease

On the basis of that literal

10

doing business object, because the union did not, as the court

11

saw the case, ask for a total cessation of business.

12

Nov;, the underlying facts at issue, the instant labor

13

dispute, arose at a construction site in Oyster Creek, New

14

Jersey, where Burns and Roe, Inc.., a general contractor, was

15

building a $68 million nuclear power plant for the New Jersey

16

Central Power and Light Company.

17

Burns and Roe, the general contractor in charge of

18

this project, had no employees of its own, it delegated all the

18

--no construction workers -- it delegated all the construction

20

work to three subcontractors, the White Construction Company,

21

Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, and Poirier and NcClane

22

Corporation.

23

Now, all these three subcontractors had among their

24

employees members of the Local 825 Operating F.ngineers Union.

25

Local 825 had contracts with two of the subcontractors,. Chicago

4

1

Bridge and Poirier, it dad no collective bargaining agreement

2

with Burns and Roe, the general contractor, nor with the White

3

Construction Company.
Now, White's job, one of the three subcontractors,

4
5

each job under each subcontractor was to build this nuclear

6

power plant, the reactor building of the nuclear power plant.

7

And White's equipment included, among other things, a piece of

8

equipment known as an electric welding machine.

9

White got the subcontract lie assigned the operation of this

1©

And as soon as

electrical welding machine, including starting and stopping

11

the machine, to employees of his who x^ere members of the Iron

12

’Workers Union.

13

Ximnted that work and urged upon White that employees of White

14

members of Local 825 Operating Engineers, be given the job

And Local 825, the Operating Engineers Union,

15

of pushing the buttons which started and stopped the xsrelding

16

machine.

17

Now, Local 825, as I pointed out, didn't have con­

18

tracts with White, the subcontractor, or with the general con­

19

tractor, and in support of its demand they presented -- they

2©

proffered agreements to White and to Burns.

21

effect, those agreements would commit White, the subcontractor,

22

and the general contractor to give all. power equipment, includ­

23

ing specifically welding machines, and give that jurisdiction

24

to the Operating Engineers.

.

25

Actually, in

.Now, these agreements would not only have bound the
5

1

signatory* White, who is doing that work, it also bound subcon­

2

tractors of the signatory so that Burns and Roe, the general

3

contractor, would have been bound to apply that subcontract to

4

White who was

&

subcontractor..

Nov/, neither White nor Burns yielded to this pressure

0
6

to sign the agreements.

7

since the parties, all the parties involved had agreed that

8

disputes

8

mitted to the national joint board for the settlement of juris­

q£

Nov/, while this dispute was going on,

this kind, jurisdictional disputes, should be sub­

10

dictional disputes.

11

and within a couple of weeks the national joint board for the

12

settlement of jurisdictional disputes, called the Dunlop board,

13

settled the dispute and decided in favor of the Iron Workers

14

to whom White had given the work.

15

weren’t satisfied.

16

with that determination of the joint board and they persisted

17

in their efforts to regain the work.

18

The dispute was submitted around October 6

But the Operating Engineers

They didn't submit, they refused to comply

Nov/, just to telescope the fact just a little bit,

19

throughout this whole period, before the joint board submission

20

Local 825 engaged in coercive efforts -- this is agreed --

21

engaged in coercive efforts by threats of work stoppages and

22

by work stoppages to compel White to change its work assignment.

23

Now, White, of course, is doing the work -- was the

24

employer doing the work in question, and Local 825, so long as

25

it observed lawful efforts in section 8(b)(4)(B), had a perfect
6

right to try to get this work.

Rut the fact is that Local 825

didn't confine itself to lawful efforts.

Not only did it use

coercive pressures against White, the employer directly in­
volved, it also used coercive pressures against the general
contractor. Burns, against the two other subcontractors, Chicago
and Poirier, as a means of getting White to comply with its
demands.
Now, Burns, Chicago and Poirier had nothing to do
with the assignment of White's work.

White was the employer

and they had no authority with respect to assignment of White's
employees.
Now, on this state of the record, the Board found and
the court below agreed that this was a violation of section
8(b)(4)(B) of the act, which is the jurisdictional disputes
provision, but the Board further found that insofar as the
union exerted coercive pressures upon Burns, Chicago, and
Poirier, who were neutrals in this dispute, because of the
workers in dispute, the union also violated section 8(b)(4)(B)
of the act since an additional object of the union's pressure
against the neutrals was to cause a

disruption of business

among the various employees at the job site.

In the Board's

view, such an object, in the Board's language, although some­
thing less than a total cancellation of business constitutes a
cease doing business object within the meaning of section
8 (b) (4) (B) .
7

Now s there is no quarrel here about the jurisdictional

i

z

dispute finding.

3

in issue is the propriety of the Board's section 8(b)(4)(B)

4

finding..

That is not being challenged»

But very much

S

Q

What did they ask for in the work contract?

6

A

For one thing, they asked for White -- Burns,

7

rather, the general contractor, to sign the contract which

8

would have bound the general contractor and his subcontractors

9

to give this v/ork to operating engineers.

They told him unless

10

he signed the contract, there would be a work stoppage, and

II

there was a work stoppage.

12

tractors unless operating engineers got the work, there would

13

be work stoppages, and there were work stoppages, and as a re­

14

sult of which operating engineers employed by the other two

15

subs went off the job.

And they told the other subcon­

These were the pressures.

16

Incidentally, the court below agrees that these kinds

17

of pressures, the threats of v/ork stoppages and work stoppages,

18

fell within the statutory disagreement -- fell within the

19

statutory definition.

20

any party.

21

That finding isn't challenged here by

Nov/, the court below, like the trial examiner in the

22

board proceeding, gave the words, the statutory words "to cease

23

doing business" a literal reading.

24

business to the court below meant a total and complete cessa­

An object of ceasing doing

I

successive disruptions in the court's view was not enough.

Ac­

2

cordingly , the court below held that the statutory criteria for

the finding of a violation, mainly the object test, was not

met.

3

sical boycott, secondary boycott which Congress was after.

8

Now, our position is that the court below erred.

This was not, the court below thought, the kind of clas­

I

7

suppose much could be made of the fact, if Your Honors please,

8

that a $68 million budget was repeatedly interrupted by a fight

9

as to who was to push a button on an electric welding machine,

10

but I don't want to make light of it.

This case, like National

11

Woodwork, like others this Court has before it, reflects the

12

deep and understandable concern of the unions who are trying to

13

preserve their job opportunities and their job security in the

U

face of automation and increasing technology.

15

talked about it often, basically in the National Woodwork case,

16

among others.

This Court has

17

Insofar as the unions sought to preserve its work op­

18

portunities for the employees it represented, and insofar as it

19

used lawful efforts, it was entitled to protection.

2©

tion here, however, is that the union went beyond lawful

21

.

grounds.

Our posi­

We submit that even if the court below was right and

22

that the only possible reading of cease doing business is a

23

total cessation of business, we believe the court erred in this

24

regard on the side of literalism, and we think a few basic

25

postulants established by this Court confirm our position.

9

1

Now, first, the basic thrust of the so-called secondary

2

boycott provision, that is 8(b)(4)(B), formerly 8(b)(4)(A), is

3

that it is designed to protect condescending employers from

4

involvement in pressures and controversies not their own.

8

was the congressional intent which was documented in the legis­

6

lative history and this Court has given the matter uniformity,

?

confirmed that in its own decisions as far as back as Denver

Building, in 341 U.S., and at least as recently as National

Woodwork in 386 U.S.

Whitewas the primary,- in fact, and the purpose

Now, the second proposition:

A literal reading of

10

section 8(b)(4)(B) and its companion provision, section

20

8(b)(4)(D), is in our view, and we believe you have so held,

21

a literal reading of those sections is an inadequate basis for

22

determining the statutory reach.

23

It would be an imposition on your time, if Your

24

Honors please, and my time is also limited, to belabor the

25

point that the statutory provisions in section 8(b)(4)(B) and
10

1

section 8(e) were the product of congressional compromise, and

2

that this conflicting compromise is reflective in statutory

3

language which, if I can understate the matter, is somewhat

4

lacking in precision.

5

precision which prompted, I think, Mr. Justice Harlan to make

6

the comment in National Woodwork, which was a split opinion,

7

and Mr. Justice Harlan commented that both sides of today's

8

division in the court agree that in pursuing the search for

9

the true intent of Congress, we should not stop with the

And I think it t/as this lack of language

10

language of the statute itself and must look beneath it to the

11

legislative history.

12

We submit that the court below rested on the naked

13

language of the statute and failed to carry out the mandate.

14

Now there is a proscribed object, a proscribed object such

15

that the statute says one of them is to cease doing business,

16

need not be the only or even the predominant object of conduct

17

within the ban of sect^- 8(b)(4)(B).

18

The court made much of the fact that, after all,

19

the real role of the union here in all its activities against

20

all the employers was not to bring about a conduct of cessation

21

of business but what they wanted was the work, but the \wrk

22

wasn't given to them, and that their real object, their real

23

goal is to get the neutrals, the secondaries, to pressure the

24

primary into hiring operating engineers.

25

of the opinion, and we conceded, and the Board so found, and
11

That was the burden

1

the finding v/as the crux of its section 8(b) (4) (B) holding.

2

The Denver Building again was the first of a long line of cases

3

establishing that it is sufficient, as the Board here found,

4

a cessation of business was an additional object, an object of

5

the union's conduct;, and this Court again pointed out in two

6

cases that come to mind immediately, that Congress deliberately

7

substituted the words "an object" for the original bill which

8

just condemned when you do it, when you exert coercive pres­

9

sures for a purpose.

They thought that was too limited and

10

substituted the words "an object," and plainly an object of

11

the union's conduct here was to bring about the kind of dis­

112

ruptions of business, the kind of work stoppages, such work

13

stoppages as would be appropriate or necessary to achieve its

14

goal, either of obtaining that work from White or conceivably

15

from compliance with the contractor.

16
17
18

Q

Do you think the Board's rule on whether or not

this does come under 8(b)(4)(B) makes any difference?
A

Yes, I believe, because the Board has worked in

19

this area, frankly, because it has expertise in this area, as

20

this Court is aware of.

21

number of times in this area, and I think the Board's expertise

22

is entitled to consideration.

the courts and the Board over the years have developed reason­

24

able criteria and reasonable methods of finding out what this

25

intent is, -and it has demonstrated by fchefc citation, adopted

by this Court in General Electric»

It seems to me that in the development ©£ sur labor

.7

judicial injunctive process.

8
9

Then we had Taft-Kart ley which* if the Court please,
carved out certain conduct which x-ms proscribed by Congress?

10

subsequently Landrum-Griffin.

11

the development of all of this lax^ was to confine the area of

12

industrial conflicts the purpose was to reduce or minimise the

13

disruption of commerce.

14

1 submit that the purpose in

In the same fashion* the Boys Market decision of

15

this Court, in June of this year, endeavors t© do that.

16

that consequently we find the emphasis in the development of

17

©ur labor law an effort to confine the conflict, and X would

18

submit that if the decision of the Third Circuit were adopted

19

here* it would so enlarge the battlefield as to undo the

20

years ©£ development of this law, the legislative history,

21

the intent of Congressi indeed we point out in ©ur brief the

22

building trades unions have tried perennially to obtain a

23

common situs bill in Congress that would allow the very type

24

of conduct engaged in here, and Congress ha3 turned back that

25

effort each time, and consequently the Third Circuit position.
2S

So

1

it seems to me* should be rejected.

2

The union has available t© it the collective -bar­
gaining*

4

it has available to it arbitration.

In that process

3

The joint board for

The union in this instance, as Mr. Ordman pointed

8

out* rejected that procedure, though bound by it, rejected the

9

conclusion of that body, though bound by it, and it was neces­

10

sary to obtain injunctive relief for the enforcement ©f that

11

type of board.

12

Moreover* not only did it reject the arbitration

13

procedure and result that it. was bound by* but it did so by

14

engaging in coercive activities against neutrals not involved

in the controversy.

16

the union.

17

Burns and Roe had n© dispute with the union.

Poirier and McClane had no dispute with

Chicago Bridge had no dispute with the union.

Consequently* if we squarely recognise the reali­

ties of the construction industry* here we see © $68 million

21

leave their equipment and by their refusal bring to one

Obviously* the statute is designed not only to pro­

25

to protect the rights Of their employees.
26

This dislocation,

that is the neutrality of the employers involved on the par­

There is no evidence in this record that

The Denver ease has been in existence since ap­

20
21

proximately 1951.

However* its principles do not, in my

22

opinion* conclusively establish that the mere feet that there

23

are independent corporations* independent contractors on a

24

construction site, that ,.that alone means that they are

25

neutral.

I believe that the principle set forth by the
37

1

petitioners has been altered by this Court in the General

2

Electric case and in the Carrier ease»

3

In those cases* although they involve separate gate

4

picketing which is not involved in this ease0 but the prin­

5

ciple remains the-same» because if the proviso to section

S

8(bl(4)(B| has any meaning, it means that if it is a primary

7

strike there are primary picketing situations that is pro­

8

tected — in those cases we had independent contractors at

S

the same job location, and this Court developed the normal

10

operations test to conclude whether the employers were in

11

actuality neutrals,, secondaries, and whether the union's right

12

to extend its dispute to these other employers was protected.
The Board does not apply the normal ©pern fcions test

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

9

distinguish between what we regard as two very separate issues

10

in the law of secondary boycotts.

11

The great majority of cases which have corse before

12

this Court involve situations involving the primary-secondary

13

dichotomy, whether activity is primary and therefore outside

14

the sweep of section 8(b5(4|(Bl because of the explicit pro­

15

viso in the 1959 legislation and because of the manifest in

16

Kent of Congress, as this Court recognized, prior to 1959. •

17

It was our understanding from the opinion of the

IS

Court below that that facet of the overall problem relating

19

to section 8(b}(4) (B} was not in this case.

2©

low concentrates on quite a different problem.

21

Aronson points out, there are decisions of this Court in

22

test of relatedness of work and there are no findings by the

made it perfectly plain that the only thing the Denver

13

Building Trades wanted was this electrical subcontractor off

14

the job because he was a thorn in their side and they were

15

going to try to drive him out of business,,

16

ings make that perfectly plain.

Q

2 want to note in con­

The findings which we note in our brief

The Board's find­

May 1 ask one more question, Mr. Gold.

Do you

18

read Judge Pretty-man's opinion in the Petail Clerks case as

10

meaning that there must be an objective of compile to cessation

20

of business?

21

A

S?o6 Your Honor.

22

G

He merely gave that

as an illustration of

23

pressure which would produce the maximum result as against a

24

pressure that had no impact at all?

25

A

Yes —
52

1

0

But lying between these two extremes, a dis­

z

ruption of business could be a violation clearly under Retail

3

Clerics?
A

4

Right, and we think: that the problem is in

5

drawing the line the Board is trying to get away fro® that by

©

cutting out the whole problem and saying wherever you ask for

7

a change in the relationship they can find that you have

8

violated section 8(bH4f (Bl but they don't have t© find any

9

object fc© harm the neutral in his economic situation.

10

And I also want to say in disagreement with ~-

11

Q

12

May I ask you, have you cited any legislative

history which supports this meaning of cease to do business?
A

13

We haven51 cited any legislative history on

14

the meaning ©f cessation to do business because we couldn't

15

find any

18

Q

1 couldn't either,

17

A

What we do is our argument really is based on

18

the language that Congress used* the reasonable emanations of

19

that language and the fact that a reading broader than fch© one

20

we would give it would knock out er make nugatory certain

21

other provisions of the act, arid we believe that this is the

22

most rational meaning that we can give.

23

Finally, X want to: note that the irreeister argu­

24

ment which is made by the Board is barred by Chenery.

25

t© disagree with the general counsel*
53

X hate

It is true that the

,

1

Board cited a case called Local 3* IBEW in stating why it

2

was finding that there was a violation here* but that case is

3

simply one which states that anything that -» any request of

4

an employer for a change of business is illegal per se under

5

section 8(b)(4)(B) and the Board -- that case really demon»

6

strates why the Board would never have turned to irreststor

7

because its per se theory makes irresisfcor, which is one

8

about drawing inferences, irrelevant.

9

is & demonstration by Board counsel that they recognise the '

And we think that this

30

weakness ©f the Board“s opinion and the Board 8 s approach in

11

this ease, and we think it is barred, and we think it would

12

have the most drastic consequence.

Thank you.

ARGUMENT OF VINCENT J. APRUZSESE, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

18

MR. AFE&ZZESEt

19

Mr* Chief Justice, just one obser­

20

vation.

21

tion ©f business can be something

J think Mr. Gold has conceded the fact that the cessa­
less than total and coxa-

r

22

plete.

I merely wish t© observe that his definition of this

23

question of something being economically disadvantageous t©

24

the neutral is something new, that our courts have not

25

adopted, and 1 submit that there-were many, subcontractors
54

1

that came on this site under Burns and Hoe subsequent to these

2

three? and the economic disadvantageous definition which has

3

never been adopted

4

ignores, onas they were economically damaged by having their

5

job stopped.

©

ments they have running expenses,, they were economically

7

damaged irrespective of what would happen with the welding

8

machine.

no legislative history to support it ~-

These men have superintendents* they have equip­

Moreover, the joint board procedure and the

9
10

appendix indicates clearly that under the engineers' contract,

11

which is in the- appendix at page 324, says that with regard fc©

12

that joint board procedure which bound all ©f these employers

13

that the last known job decision must be followed by each of

14

them* consequently if the engineers had won this particular

15

type of dispute, that would have been a condition that would

16

have to have been accepted by Burns and any of his subs and,

17

consequently, it would have been economically disadvantageous.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
