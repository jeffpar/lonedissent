MORAL ARGUMENT BY DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR, FRIEDMAN:

7

the Court:
This case, which is here on a direct appeal to the

8

9

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

United States District Court for the Western District of New

10

York, brings before the Court the validity of a 1955 merger

11

between the two leading firms engaged in the printing of color

12

comic supplements for newspapers»
The appeal presents a group of typical Section 7

13
14

questions: the definition of the relevant product market? the

15

question of whether the effect of the merger might be to sub­

16

stantially lessen competition? the question of whether the

17

acquired company is a failing company and the question of

18

whether

divestiture is appropriate relief»
The three principal firms involved in this case

which I will describe briefly»

The acquiring firm, the

Appellee, Greater Buffalo Press, at.the time of the acquisition
had a plant in Buffalo, and also a plant in Dunkirk, New York»
The second firm is the acquired company: Inter­
national Color Press»

At the time of the acquisition it also

had two plants? one in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, and the other
2

1

in Peoria, Illinois, but. the Peoria plant has been closed.
The third principal actor in this story is a firm

called. King Syndicate that is a division of the Hearst

Corporation.

The Government complaint, which was filed in 1961,

to

challenged not only the merger that is here before the Court,

12

but also alleged that Greater Buffalo, Hearst, through King,

and another syndicate had engaged in a conspiracy to divide
customers, to fix prices and to monopolize the printing of
color comic supplements; alleged that King and the other news­
paper syndicate had also engaged in illegal tie-in agreements,
under which the plan was that the licensing of the comic sup­
plements was tied to the dealing with the syndicate for
printing.
In 1965 the Government settled the case against
Hearsfc, through the entry of a consent judgment under which
there were various prohibitions upon llearst, including the
prohibition upon engaging in time agreements, although the
judgment, that judgment would not preclude King from quoting a
single price for features and printing; for the licensing, that

Is, and printing»
However* that judgment also contains provisions

2

that in the event that Greater Buffalo is found to have

4

violated any provision of the anti-trust laws the judgment may

then be reopened»
Q

Why did it take so long* ten years to bring

Ten years —

Before this case gets up here?

If I may* Mr, Justice* I would just like to

this case --

briefly describe the chronology of it and explain why.

was made.

19

Excuse me* Mr. Friedman, isn’t it more than

ten years?

14
IS

Q

case.

The merger took place in 1955.

Two or three years

thereafter* an employee of another firm made a complaint to the
Department of Justice that Hearts was engaging in tie-ins.
Following this complaint in some preliminary investigation
there was a grand jury investigation in Buffalo.

At the con­

clusion of .the grand jury the Government decided not to seek
an indictment, but instead to bring a civil suit.
4

1

The original complaint did not relate, of course,

2

to the merger? the original complaint related t© the tie-ins

3

by Hearst and Sing, but in the course of our investigation we

4

developed other facts, including the facts relating to the

5

merger which led us to conclude that there were violations in

6

addition to those that had been brought to our attention.

7

Now, the ten years between the time that the com­

8

plaint was filed and the case comes to this Court, has been

9

occupied by serious situations a

First, two or three years

10

were occupied by the Government1s first successful attempt to

11

obtain a preliminary injunction against the transfer of certain

12

assets in the Wilkes-Barre plant of International to a plant

'23

that they built down in Sylacauga, Alabama»

25

Following that we had negotiations over the consent
decree, which led to the consent decree against Hearst«
The trial actually began in October of 1965»

And,

of course, in the interval, I might add, that after we had
gotten the preliminary injunction then there were further pro­
ceedings; there was more testimony taken on a motion by the
Appellees to modify the injunction.
Following the completion of the Government’s case
in October of 1965, in 1966 there was a hearing on whether the
Government had established a prima facie case.

And a year and

a half elapsed after that hearing until the defendant’s ease
came and the defendant’s case came in the summer of 3.967?
5

1

briefs ware filed about a year thereafter,,

2

were not held until about a year thereafter, which was in

December of 1969»

Present arguments

Mow, the reason for all this delay is basically

S

this, as I understand it:

6

the 1960s there was only one judge on the bench in Baltimore»

7

That was Judge Henderson»

8

Q

In Buffalo»

A

At that time in the latter part of

After a successive judge was appointed the man

11

selected for the post was the United States Attorney, and as

12

a result this new judge was not qualified to hear any ©£ the

13

pending criminal cases»

14

priority it was meant that Judge Henderson was required to

15

spend the major part of his time in this area on trying the

16

criminal cases»

17

This is the reason for the delay»

18

delay is attributable to the Government, Mr» Chief Justice»

I think it is unfortunate»

I am afraid this was just one of those

We tried to do everything we could to drop the

charge of violating Section 2, ‘the monopolisation charge, for
the purpose of trying to expedite the thing»

We did everything

we could to get' the case moving but I think it was just one of
those unfortunate

things in which the judicial process

sometimes moves slowly:,

Q

The only issue that is here now is the

Section 7 issue?

A

4

That is correct„ Mr, Justice? that6s all

5

that is appealed from is the Court’s dismissal of the Section

6

7,
Q

7
3

Is that the reason, Mr, Friedman, why the

monopolization charge was dropped?
A

3

Me stated explicitly in our, in a motion ---

10

in a notice we filed, stating tha* w© were dropping the mono­

11

polization charge; that we were doing so for the purpose of

12

expediting the trial of the case.
That, is set forth at page 516, 513 and 19, I

13
14

think, of the record,

15

Q

That that was the reason?

Now, coming to the facts of the case, most

17

Sunday newspapers in this country have what I have in my hand,

the typical color supplements.

20

has to get two things.

21

rights, and the newspaper has to get the license for these

22

features.

the supplement printed and the printing of comic color supple­

24

ments is a very, requires special skills,

25

that can be done ~ they are., done with four different inks and

The supplement has two ele­

In addition, the newspaper has to arrange to have

1

it takes a great technique to accomplish this.
The licenses for using the comic — color comics

2

themselves, are controlled by the syndicates and the syndicates

4

license to the newspaper as many of these particular comics as

5

they want.

6

ticular comics from a single syndicate.

7

a combination and this one of the Washington Post shows that

8

the different comics coma from half a dosen or more syndicates.

Sometimes the newspaper will get all of its parMore likely it will be

Wow, approximately one-third of all of these color

comic supplements are printed by the newspapers themselves.

11

The remaining two-thirds are printed by the so-called "Comic

12

Color Supplement Printers , ” of which/ the two merging com­

13
14

panies are the two leading ones.
At the time of the acqusition and even to this day

everyone concedes that Greater Buffalo Press is the ladder in

the comic supplement field.

They pay their bills to King and King in turn

then pays International.

But, of course, the price that King

pays International necessarily determines what kind of an offer
King, in turn, can make to the newspapers.

And, not unexpec­

tedly the record in this case shows that over the years there
was a constant battle between King on the on© hand, and Inter­
national on the other over price.

And King, on occasion has

forced International to cut its prices in order that King could
meet a

particular competitive situation.
King held something of a club over International

At the time of the merger in June of 19S5# King

and International were negotiating a new printing contract

which they wanted to be a long-term contract.

7

after the acquisition was consummated they did sign a long-tent

3

contract and it was the same prices they had before# but they

had no six months cancellation clause.

At

the time of the'merger King and International each had sales

15

of about eight-and-a-half million dollars.

16

There is a dispute between the parties as to what

17

their respective shares of the market was.

18

whether or not in calculating the market you include in the

would be a source of printing for any other newspapers.

Under our study of the market# as we interpret it

You mean 75 percent of that two-thirds

portion which you were talking about?

S

A

75 percent of the two-thirds? right.

6

Under the defendant’s evaluation the two firms

7

together had just under 42 percent of the whole market? their

8

42 percent;'is 42 percent of the whole market; ours is 75 per­

9

cent of the two-thirds.

But? under either standards? these two

10

firms simply dwarfed the rest of the industry.

n

firms was. at least five times as large as any of the other

12

four or five independent printers.
How? the facts relating to the acquisition are

13
u
15

16

17

Each of these

relatively simple.

The original organiser of International?

the acquired company? had been dead for many years.

The stock

of the company at the time of the acquisition was owned by two
of

his children? who had made n© investment in the company?

18

who had nothing to do with the running of the business.

19

let a Mr. Goman? the President of International? run it.

20

sole interest was in the dividends they could get out of the

25

company.

They
Thei:

And finally, they tried to sell this plant in 1952

to Eearsfc and King and Hearst was not interested.
In December 1954 negotiations began between the
President of International and the President of Greater Buffalo
International9s man indicated the property he thought could be
11

1

purchased at the book value and that was ultimately done in

2

June of 1 55, at a price of §575,000.

3

that Gorman, the President ©f International, kept King fully

4

informed during the whole course of these negotiations, of

5

what was going on.

6

took place, in March of 1 55 the sales manager of King, a man

7

named Nicht, wrote a letter to his superior in which he pointed

3

out the King role that King occupied in connection with this
merger.

But, the record show

And, three months before the acquisition

As--he said, "Although the owners of International are

10

anxious to sell, they can hardly sell without our consent and

11

cooperation."

12

they can hardly continue to purchase plans without our approval ■

13

He further added that"Greater Buffalo realises

Mow, of course, the reason for King’s control over

this thing is quite obvious; without the arrangements that

13

International, had with King or International had with the

10

printing plants, there were no customers.

18

International did

On the other hand, King also had a very real stake

1

in this thing because King at this time;, was basically dependent,

20

upon International for its printing.

21

minute now to what the District Court said in explaining the

22

significans® of why this interrelationship, as a practical

23

matter, meant that even though the contracts between King and

24

International was not signed until a month after the merger,

25

in fact, at the time of the merger Greater Buffalo knex>? that by

12

And I will come in a

1

acquiring International it was acquiring basically King8a

2

printing presses.

3

The District Court held against us on the Section

4

7 issue on really two grounds.

3

that because of the advantage King has in selling printing as

6

a result of its control oi?er the features, there were, two

7

different markets here;"One market

8

printing of comic color supplements for sale directly to the

9

newspapers, and the other market was for sale to the syndi­

10

First, the District Court said

,v

said the Court, "Is the

cates which then sold them to thenewspapers •

11

And the Court" went on and said: "The effect of

12

this acquisition may not have been substantially to lessen

13

competition because in the first place," it said, "Greater

14

Buffalo and International are not in competition; they are not

IS

in the same market *

16

that is to the syndicates.

17

othermarket, to the newspapers themselves.

18

same market, so there could fo@ no elimination of competition

'19

20

International, is spelling to one market;
Greater Buffalo is selling to the
They are not in the

between them.1"'
Secondly they said that since the time that the ~

21

the Court said that since at the time of the acquisition King

22

had no firm contract with International, Greater Buffalo was

23

not acquiring any share of the printing business; it was a tie-

24

in expectation that with its skill it could pick up some of this

25

business, .and finally it said in any ©vent, International was a
13

1

failing company.
Then, at the end of its opinion, in the last

2
3

sentence of the portion dealing with the Section 7 violation,

4

the; Court said that even if there were some violations of

3

Section 7 here it would not be appropriate for divestiture

6

years after the acquisition took place»
Q

7
8

15

Did the record show anything as to new

entries into the market since 1961 or since the trial?

A

9

There is evidence that there is one firm

10

that developed very rapidly in the early 1960s,

11

dispute between us as t© the ease of entry.

12

found that there were no substantial barriers to entry.

13

claim is that anybody can print? all you need is a printing

14

press; that there is plenty of surplus capacity in this great

15

ease of entry.

18

The District Court
The

Now, we think that there are serious barriers to

16
17

There is a

entry in this business for two reasons: first, this is a vary
skilled thing.

This is not just turning the press on and

19

printing.

20

fact of the matter is that a large number of newspapers have

El-

22
23
24
25

You have got to know what you are doing, and the

it is financially advantageous to them to shift their printing
business from their o%m printing facilities to one of these
printers.
In addition, one® you have a firm which has 75
percent of the printing market available.

14

That is with papers

i

who don't print their own, it seems that this itself, as it has

2

been recognized# creates a substantial barrier to entry.

3

I can say that I know of no new firms that have gone into the

4

business.

5

another independent color printer went out of business.

6

was a firm called Buffalo Colorprint# a smaller printer# which

7

Greater Buffalo also acquired# that was doing printing for

8

another one of the syndicates in this case.

9

In fact# in

And

955# shortly after this acquisition#
That

How# we start# it seems to me# x^ith a self-

10

evident proposition# which is basically: Greater Buffalo and

11

International are in the same business.

ing this thing and of course# an essential element of the

and it seems

15

to us it doesn't amake any difference that a particular dis­

6

tributor# such as King# may have had seams advantages in dis­

7

tribution? it's still the same product.

8

be — it doesn't become a different product merely because one

It doesn't ceasetto

firm is distributing it through King and the other firm is

20

distributing directly.

21

22
23

24
25

And therefore# under the decisions of this Court#
we think that the business of printing and selling color comic
supplements was a relevant market.

I stress the word ,!a#e3

because it may well be that printing for syndicates is also an
independent relevant market# but certainly this is ,5aS! relevant

International had

I. think when it started in 1925 it had two

small customers and for almost 30 years it had been printing

exclusively for King.

13

Mow, within this borderline of promise, which we

14

think is the relevant market; that is sale and printing, we

15

think that there would be no doubt that the affect of this

16

acquisition may have been substantially to lessen competition.

17

The District Court found* sisd no one disputes it,

18

that Greater Buffalo- and King were engaged in active competi­

19

tion for the business of printing color comic supplements, and

20

this competition between them in selling the printing

2!

necessarily reflected and was dependent upon the competition

22

between Greater Buffalo and International in

23

only if International kept its prices low enough, would King be

24

in a-position to compete effectively with Greater Buffalo.

printing, because

And I think the realities of this were recognized
16

1

in 1954 in a letter that Mr. Gorman, the President of Inter-

2

national,, wrote to the unions when he was complainig

3

unions were putting very onerous conditions upon them? that he

4

couldn't deal with, because he was complaining, as he said ~

5

he referred to Greater Buffalo as his competitor and he is

complaining that Greater Buffalo is talcing business away from

7

him because of the onerous burdens.

was taking -business’ away from it?

From it? yes.

Well, in any event, Greater Buffalo, if 1 might

11

12

take just a minute to describe it, had a very inauspicious and

13

humble beginning back in 1926*

14

Koessler who was a reporter on a newspaper, who entered the

15

business for himself, with members of theffamily assisting him,

16

with an investment of $1,000 to $3,000? and they put up a

17

little printing press right in their own home.

18

the family worked and they printed a little neighborhood 'news­

19

paper, and I guess they were helped by the depression in the

20

30s, because it began to print these mortgage foreclosures and

21

happenings, legal notices connected with bankruptcies and so

have to get to that in a few minutes.

20

In answer to the inquiry from the bench? the first

21

business ©f King that Greater Buffalo got was in the year 1954

22

when a run from Youngstown, Toledo and I think Erie, Pennsyl-'

23

vania, was transferred to it by Nichfc of Hearst.

24
25

In the ertremness in which International found
itself, it sought to sell the plant, the business, if you could
22

8

call it that, to Hearsfc.

Iiaportuniti.es ware made, insistent

Now, at th© time of the purchase International was

9

Koessler bought it for $575,000 back in 1955,

engaged in negotiations looking toward a long-term contract.

10

Those negotiations had not ripened into a contract and at the

11

time that Greater Buffalo bought it on June 25, 1955, it had no

12

contract assurance of business and it took a calculated busi­

S3

ness risk and bought what was the equivalent of some obsolete

14

machinery which it hoped to modernise with its own techniques

15

and make efficient.
Well, there is an element in the case which £

16

17

dont9 shrink from, which I think I should talk about for just

18

a moment.

19

the Lufkin plant became a reality and Nichfc learned that — and

in other words, that he wanted to become the exclusive sales
agent for the Greater Buffalo Press and that Greater Buffalo
Press should print only for International and there is exten­

23

And I would

characterise it as a flirtation on the part of the parties
2

looking toward a line-up when and whereby Hearsfe would be the

3

seller — King would be the seller and the Greater Buffalo

4

would be the printer.

5

And this went on over a period of two or three

6

years and accounts for some of the documents in the record,

7

which at first blush, are somewhat embarrassing» I think to

8

both King and Greater Buffalo.

and for the purpose of this discussion, whether you take the

relevant market as that which the Court found, or the relevant

fact remains that there are no barriers.

of this stuff, has gone from 477,714 four-page sections 'per

It's an established fact that every printing

company that is a factor in this industry, or was a factor in

1955, at the time of our acquisition, has increased its busi­

Mow, in the early days of this case, I repeats we were des­

This is the first time I ever heard a Government Counsel seek

13

a divestiture from the victim for the benefit of the predator.

building of the Sylacauga plant.

River Paper Company down there, and as early as 1950, Coosa

they could built a plant for us if we would take their pro­

■Well, it seems that this Coosa River, contacting

6

printers generally to see if they could get someone to build

a plant, also contacted International and that International,

planned to pursue the subject on its own.

Well, he went to

Hearst and Hearst wouldn’t give him a long-term contract

wouldn’t do a thing to promote the development of the plant in

Sylacauga.

Now, after — not before, but after the acquisition,

we built the plant, completed it five years later.

that Hearst would not enter the printing, often citing a

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Government is seeking the divestiture of the

7

Sylacauga plant, not to aid the wrongdoer, Hearst, but

&

we think that under normal principles governing divestiture,

9

which you have to have if the plant, the entity to be divested,

10

must be capable of functioning as a strong effective competitive

factor in the marketplace.

Now, the way this market is now

become the kind of plant that is necessary to provide competi­
tion for Greater Buffalo, it’s got to have a facility in the
South because the newspaper customers down there now are used
to a southern plant; they save substantial money as a result of
the saving of transportation costs.
We are not, of course, suggesting, as Mr. Raichle
somehow suggests, that we are trying to put Hearst infcb the
printing business.

We're not saying that the plant has to be

divested to Hearst.

All that we are saying is that when you

divest International and of course I just mention in passing,
divestiture is the normal, remedy when you have a stock acquisi­
tion that violates the act, when you divest it you've got to
divest it in a way thatmakes it into a strong competitive force

point did not have the financing available# but it seems# in the
light of the pressure that were coming upon International from
King in the light of all this extensive plant it certainly is
most reasonable and most likely that if there hadn't been this

situation International somehbw would have found a way to

2

build a plant»

3

Now, it’s quite clear that the plant was actually

4

built by Greater Buffalo and Greater Buffalo paid for it, but

S

it seeis® to, at least in the inception the Spirit of the thing,

6

that this was enough of an International plant that it would

7

be approprirate to require that it be divested in order to

8

establish the kind of strong company that is necessary to

9

restore competition in this industry.
Q

10

There is nothing very remarkable, though,

11

about this move into the Deep South by an expanding industry;

12

is there?
A

13

There is nothing remarkable about it, with

14

this exception, Mr. Chief Justice: this move into hthe Deep

IS

South was not the typical move where a firm finds that this is

16

an attractive area for various reasons to develop a new £ac<“
J

17

fcary.

This move into the Deep South is because of the --

18

basically because of the transportation situation.

19

newspapers are located in the Deep South, which is much better

20

off financially if they had a nearby plant,

21

not 'the printers, that pay the cost of transporting the supple­

22

ment from the printing plant to the newspaper plant.

23

24
25

think this is what's involved in this case.

That is:

Xt3s the newspaper

And I

It is an attempt

~ they moved in there because they needed the plant and I
think it was a realistic matter if you divest International

34

I

Without this plant down south it9s going to be very* very

2

difficult for there to be any really effective competition

3

created by International.
