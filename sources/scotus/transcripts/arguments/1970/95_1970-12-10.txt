ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WISCONSIN,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR, SOUTHWICK:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts

11

Assistant Attorney General with the State of Wisconsin and I

12

am here today representing the State of Wisconsin in this

13

case, which came up from a decision of a three-judge panel in

14

the Eastern District of Wisconsin,

15

my name is Benjamin Southwick and I am an

The issue before this Court is whether sections of

13

the Wisconsin statutes, which I will discuss in a moment,

17

meet the requirements of procedural due process.

18

court decided this question by a two-to-one decision against

19

the state that the statutes were, in fact, unconstitutional,

20

with a dissent by the United States Senior Circuit Judge

2!

F, Ryan Duffy,

22

The lower

These statutes which are Sections 176,26 and

23

176,28 Sub l.of the Wisconsin Statutes state, and which are

24

set forth in pages 116 and 117 of the Appendix, state in

25

essence that a series of local officials, including the wife
2

?

of any individual and including the chief of police of any

2

city6- thay. these series of local officials which are set forth

3

in the statute, when they make a finding according to certain

4

standards which are set forth in the statutes and these

5

standards essentially relate to the exposing of an individual

6

or his family to want or the town or village to which he lives

7

to liability for his support or the injuring of the indivi­

8

dual’s health or the endangering of the personal safety and

9

comfort of any member of his family or the endangering the

10

security of the property of any person or becoming dangerous

11

to the peace of any community, when any of these local

12

officials, including the wife of an individual, make a finding

13

and their finding is made without notice of intention to make

14

it and without a hearing, when these standards are met, then

15

these empowered local officials can send notice to the effect

16

to any person and it's normally persons within that jurisdic­

17

tion, that the person against whom this standard was found,

13

is forbidden to purchase alcoholic beverages or to be given

19

alcoholic beverages for a period of one year.

20

provides that a copy ©f this notice shall be sent to the

21

person who has been what we call®"posted," and the punitive

22

section: Section 176.28 (1)

23

knowingly serves an individual alcoholic beverages who has

24

been so posted, shall be subject to certain criminal penal­

-

provides that any person who

3

Q

This case arose* if I may continue — did
Mr. Justice White?

/
I was just wondering* are there any of -the

4

findings as to this Petitioner that you said* must precede

5

the sending of a notice?

6

A

1

Those findings are not set forth* no?

there is no —

8

Q

Nowhere in the record?

9

A

There is nothing in the record* although a

10

deposition was taken later on of the lady* the Appellee* Mrs.

11

Constantineau* who was —

12

Q

I gather from what you told us the scheme

13

requires the police chief or some other official to make these

14

findings before the notice is sent; isn't that so?

15
16

A

He makes those in his own mind because he

doesn’t have to —and this is the problem in the case before

M

the Court, is that there is no provision for a hearing or for

IS

any setting forth of the statute --

19
20
21

Q

No* but where -- where does it appear that

he* in fact* made any findings?
A

Well* he made the finding in the sense that

22

he did
issue the notice to the bartenders in the City of
%

23

Hartford, Wisconsin.

24
25

Q

And we are therefore to assume that he must

have made the necessary findings —
5

1

A

That is correct^ that is correct, Mr. Justice

Q

You mean the findings are implicit in the

A

That’s correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

What do you think is the purpose of the

statute?

8
9

very legitimate one, which is to regulate and to limit the

10

noxious. effects ’which alcoholic beverages can have upon an

11

individual.

i

Q

12

13

'
Do you think it is protective of the indi­

vidual posted, as wall as the community and —
A

14

Ivouid certainly say that that's the case,

15

Mr. Justice Blackmun; certainly of the family and of the

16

community in which he is — resides as well.
Q

17
18

Do you know of any other states which have

a comparable statute?
A.

19

1 have set forth in the Appendix E of ray

20

original statement, Mr. Justice Blackmun, -there are 15 other

21

states which have similar statutes which do not provide, as

22

this case does not, this statute in Wisconsin does not pro­

23

vide for a hearing or a notice of intention to post to the

24

25

individual.
Q

Whenyou talk about findings here„ what you
6

,

1

mean —* do I understand it correctly:the finding of the wife

2

ors in -this case — who made the findings?
A

3

The local official in this case» Mr.. Justice

4

Harlan, was the chief of police who made the finding, and as

5

I say, in his own mind he made the finding —

25

That is correct.
Did the copy of the notice that’s required

Well, that is the posting, and I think the

posting is used in the sense of the word "mailing,"

perhaps and not in the sense of posting on a bulletin board,
which is a point I hope to get to later.
Q

18
19

case the wife

to be given, is that precede the posting of the —

14
15

But if you take the

oauld make the finding against her husband? is that right?

IS

13

This is shown by the fact that he sent the

notice out to ~

9
10

In Ms own mind.

But the recipient doesn’t, gat it before

the notice and whatever legal effect it has, takes effect?
does it?
A

The recipient gets it contemporaneously with

all of the bartenders and the bar owners.
Q

Is an individual who has been thus posted,

guilty of any criminal act ~
A

No, there «ire no criminal penalties, .

7

?

whatsoever against the person who lias been posted, and as I

2

pointed out in the brief»

3

states, as set forth in the jurisdictional statement indi­

4

cate that soma of the other states do provide criminal penal­

5

ties for the person posted, but the Wisconsin statute does

6

not ”~

8

Q

As the statutes from the other

Does it anywhere appear, Mr» Southwick, the

powers of the Chief — anywhere in the record?

9

A

Wo, it does not appear? Mr. Judice Brennan.

10

But facts andthe nature of the lady's circumstances do appear

11

in the record and the deposition that was taken --

12

Q

13

A

,

Is that in -the record?
It is in -the record? yes, but it has not

14

been reprinted in the Appendix and I am begging, of course,

15

pardon, for that oversight.
Q

IS
17

Certain portions of it —

Well, Mr. Southwick, what can the posted

man do once he gets the notice?

18

A

Bag your pardon?

19

Q

Once he gets the notice -that everybody else

20

gets, what under the sun can he do?
A

21

If he is a tee-totaler.

He has numerous alternatives, Mr. Justice

22

Marshall.

If, as suggested, he is a tee-totaler, h@ can bring

23

an action as Mrs. Constantineau has done against —

24

Q

25

A

In the Federal Courts?
In the Federal Courts or in the-- state

courts.

There is no machinery in the statute for

Q

He has no due process at all.

Do we agree

A

That is correct. Your Honor, Mr. Justice

Q

And then once these are all mailed out is

on that?

Q
9

A

any sort of hearing,

6
7

But there is no machinery set up by the

state —

4
5

Q

Marshall.

there any way to get them mailed bask?
A

Well, 'the two judges in the Federal District

13

tell me that they are doing it, and I don't mean to be

14

facetious, Mr. Justice Marshall, when I say that, but there is

15

no provision in tine statute for "unposting".

IS

Q

Is there anything in the statute that

17

prevents the bartender from pasting this notice up on his

18

mirror in his bar so that God and everybody else can see it?

19

A

It is not all stated infche statute, Mr.

20

Justice Marshall, what the person receiving the notice should

21

do with it, of course, and this is a point I intend to make,

22

that the statutes are not on their face, unconstitutional be­

23

cause they don’t provide — they merely provide for this notice

24

to go to 'the various bartenders and not that they set them up

25

on the walls, or that -they publish them in any way —
9

I

2

Q

We are all clear that there is no semblance

of due process in this at all?

3

A

4

Q

5

Absolutely.
Before or after a man's name is put up any­

place anybody wants to put it up?

S

A

2 wot.

vigorously contest the assumption

7

of the question, Mr. Justice Marshall, that it is put up

8

somewhere.

9

that this be published at all -—
Q

10

i?

What I'm saying is that there is no protec~

tion at all to prevent anybody from
A

12
13

The statute don't provide it and as 1 said earlier

There is no protection in the statute agains

the arbitrary —
Q

14

So that if a wife tells her husband, "You

15

either give me a mink coat for Christmas or you get posted on

IS

January 1,” he's in trouble. Is that right?
A

17
13

He's in trouble in the sense that he could

be posted by the wife? that’s correct.
Q

19

But he says, "If you don't give me one I'm

20

going to have you posted."

21

wouldn't she?
A

22

WEli

She would get the mink coat

there is a problem in the statute,

23

I think, although not one raised by this case, Mr. Justice

24

Marshall, that the wife is given powers which the husband is

25

not.

But, I don't think, along a similar vein, Mr. Justice
10

1

Marshall, that the concept of empowering a private individual

2

is at all unique in this situation in the whale area of the

3

state's regulation of alcoholic beverages and I cite the

4

example of a bartender is forced to make a determination that

S

an individual is of the sufficient age to drink, at least 21

e

years old.

7

Or in the case of -the dram shop act mentioned by

8

Mr. Justice Blackmun, that the bartender is given the onus of

9

making a decision of whether somebody is intoxicated or not,

10

and I simply would suggest that these delegations to private

11

individuals in this whole area of law, regulating the field

12

of alcoholic beverages, is because these private individuals

13

are often people who are closest to the problems and to the

14

situations involved and this, of course --

15

q

All the regulations that he'a"talking

IS

about are regulating the dram shops, not -the shoppees, or the

17

shoppers.

18

This goes to the shopper not the shop.
A

Correct, Justice Marshall, and I think in

19

the cases and I really hadn't anticipated arguing this case

20

purely from the analysis of looking at'it in terns of the so-

21

called right to obtain alcoholic beverages, but I think that's

22

a very minimal right and I think the states --

23

Q

And it certainly can be controlled?

24

A

Certainly it can foe greatly controlled be­

25

cause I think the states have a great amount of power in this
11

1

area,, especially since the passage of -the 21st Amendment.

a

Q

I think there was something in your brief

3

as 1 recall it, that you said that if the recipient of one

4

of these notices thought these findings were improvidently

5

made, they could get it reviewed by common-law writ?
A

Common law writ of certiorari, Mr. Justice

S

Q

In Wisconsin?

9

A

That is correct, but I will point out that

S
7

Harlan.

i

10

this is not — it's discretionary with the court to grant such

11

a review.

12

Q

Is it aprocedure that is utilized or ~

13

A

I never heard of any litigation under the

14

statute prior to this case.

IS

Q

IS

Q

17

Never.
But at best, it's not a review of right? it’s

a discretionary .review? that's all.

18

A

That is correct.

19

Q

Well, why would you call it a review — I

20

mean how do you need to limit it to a review?

21

bring an independent action for an injunction?

22

A

1 suggest —

23

Q

In the Wisconsin state courts

24

2S

Couldn't you

andsue

the

police chief and the ~ and tell him to revoke this ~
A

That's certainly true, Mr.Justice White.

as well chosen the state forum.

And# of course# the Appellee# Mrs» Constantineau

And I don’t think the

-9

statute can contemplate# really# any arbitrary and malicious

10

activity by a local official under the statute. I don’t think

11

that the fact that such an activity could occur is a point

12

to make the statute unconstitutional.
Q

13
14

Well# as" a matter of fact# they ruled on the

statute on its face# didn’t they?

That’s correct# Mr. Justice Marshall.

As I read the opinion the statute on

That’s what the court said# Mr. Justice

Marshall.
Qc course# what’s happened in this ease is that

20
21

Mrs. Constantineau has been posted by the Chief of Policeof

22

the City of Hartford# Wisconsin and the — Mrs. Constantineau

23

brought an action in the Federal Court# alleging two causes

24

of action.

25

the chief of police for acting maliciously and arbitrarily

In the first cause of action# which was against

13

!

this was the cause of action in which she mentioned and dis­

2

cussed the right of reputation and the right to he free of

The second cause of action, which is the cause of

4

action before this Court in which she sought an injunction:

6

the right of reputation was never mentioned , the right to be

7

free from public defamation.

The state made motions to

on the constitutionality of the statute, counsel for Mrs.,

II

Constantineau never mentioned the right of Mrs. Constantineau

12

to be free, from public defamation and to be free of reputation

13

and the state sought to produce witnesses on this point and

14

subpoenaed Mrs. Constantineau as the record shows, but Judge

15

Reynolds of the majority in the lower court refused the motion

16

of the state to produce witnesses and in the questioning which

r/

appears in the Appendix at page 113, of Judge Reynolds of the

18

majority in the lower court, of myself, who was representing
the state.

Judge Reynolds said, ana

as

being held up to ridicule for reasons which the party may not

have any —

else in this case.”

24

Q

25

Well, what's publicly defamatory about
14

II

i

it, supposedly?

z

There is no posting, is there?

A

Well, that’s exactly my point in this Court,

3

Your Honor,Mr. Justice White, is that there is nothing

4

publicly defamatory about the actions which can ba taken under

3

the statute and that —■

6

Q

Except that the people to whom the notices

7

are marled, and I suppose it’s more than one, know that the

8

police chief has an opinion -that here’s someone who shouldn’t

9

drink.
A

10

Well, all that the notice says and it does

11

appear in the record -- all that the notice says, and I quote

12

from the one sentence of the notices

It is my contention* Mr. Justice —

12

Q

I mean* what did Judge Reynolds* do you think
<

13

mean by that?
A

14
15

I -think that these statutes are familiarly

known in Wisconsin as the Alcoholic Posting Statutes* and I

IS

think posting could mean mailing.

17

as opposed to posting -- because the chief of police could

18

easily serve his notice by mail* I would think, on the various

19

Lartenders.

20
25

I suppose the posting —

Q

What9s the point in putting it in the mail?

A

There is no point in the statutes in which

there is a requirement that they toe put up on a bulletin board ,

Is she subject to a notice iiow?

She is subject only in the statutes to

receive the notice contemporaneously with the bartender

receiving the same notice

notice?

Welly I mean is she subject to this original

The force of that has expired, hasn't it?
A

Well, it would be — the lower court ordered

that the notices be retraefcad, Mr. Justice Harlan.
Q

Mr. Southwick, what efforts were made to

7

utilise stata proceedings or administrative proceedings to

8

deal with this problem by Mrs. Constantineau?

9

to

A

Well, Mrs. Constantineau, Mr. Chief Justice,

chose the Federal forum —

n

Q

You mean she didn’t try anywhere else?

12

A

Ho, Mr. Chief Justice, not to my knowledge.

13

She chose the Federal forum and brought the two causes of

14

action: one for an injunction which is -the cause of action

15

here? and there is — the first cause of action is still

16

pending for damages! in the Eastern District.

‘i 7

The majority in the lower court and both sides in

18

the lower court took the so-called "balancing test," approach

19

to this case which is ~ starts with the Joint Anti-Fascist

20

Refugee Committee, Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s concurring

21

opinion and the later cases of Cafeteria Workers versus

22

Me Elroy and Goldberg versus Kelly, took this approach of,

23

in determining the requirements of due process to any given

,24

situation, of balancing the interests of government / on -the

25

one hand and the interests of the individual on the other hand-.

17

1

And both the majority and the dissent in the lower court

2

agreed that when we look at this case solely in terms of the

3

right of the state to regulate alcoholic beverages# both the

4

majority and the dissent agreed that clearly the statute was

5

constitutional and that due process did not require any notice

s

of hearing»

17

statutes are referred to as the Alcoholic Posting Statutes#

It could last for a year, couldn't it?

A

That’s true,

but another of the statute

too provides, Mrs.Justie© Harlan, that sections can be renewed

10

for.. an additional' year.

11

Q

But you would have to give her a new one;

13

A

That is correct.

But, so far as this notice is concerned,

12

wouldn't you?

15

no matter what happens to tills csae, the notice has spent

17
13

20

A

That's correct, but the ~ of course, the

state is concerned with upholding the statutory schema.
Q

I know, but what I'm raising is; is there

any question of mootness in the case?

21

A

I would say not,

22

Q

Why not?

23

A

Because, under the statute this lady could

be reposted —
Q

Well, ’chat's another notice.
19

A

But the statutory scheme —

2

Q

If sheEs become a teetotaler she wouldn't

3

— there wouldn't be any basis for giving her a notice.

4

A

Well, you still could under the statute —

5

I suppose that's a good way to make a person

6

a teetotaler.

?

Anyway, today she's perfectly free to buy

all the liquor she wants?
A

9

Yes, Mr. Jus&Lee Brennan and it is our con>*

10

tention in the lower court that she was perfectly free to buy

11

them other than —

12

13

it outside of Hartford.

14

A

Well, I had been ~

Was there any injunction entered against

That was declared unconstitutional? wasn't

That order is —

A

That is correct; *yes.

And the order appears

on page 124 of the Appendix.
Q

Well, isn’t that rather relevant to the

mootness of it?
A

The lower court found that the statutes were
20

;

'I

unconstitutional on their face.

2

Q

Well, more than that they —

3

Well, wouldn’t the police chief be in

It is my contention, if it please the Courts

12

in this Court and in the lower Court that the whole question

22

24

Q

Th© District Court didn’t reach that, did

A

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the only finding

it?

that we have in fcha lower court is the statment of Judge
Reynolds of the majority in the lower opinion, when he says,
and I quote from page 119 of the appendix, ”It would be naive
not to recognise that such posting or characterization of an
individual expose him to public embarrassment and ridicule,"
21

1

so that despite the failure in this cause of action of Mrs,

z

Consfcantineau to allege any damage to injury as a cause for

3

the statutes to ba unconstitutional ©n their face and despite

4

the court's forbidding the state from calling any witnesses

5

in this case* the Judge made that assumption purely on his own

6

that it would be naive and the submission of -the state to this

7

Court is. 'that this whole question of reputation is not present

8

in the operation of these statutes»

9

record of this case and the deposition which is in the record

It's not present in the

10

in which repeat* I'm embarrassed to say it was not reprinted

It

in the appendix* shows that the only point to which Mrs,

12

Constantineau was hurting her reputation was -the statement that

13

she made in the court in the disposition that she was am™

14

barrassed by the operation of the statutes.
Later on she said that she didn't know her own

15
16

reputation in this small city of Hartford for any matter ex­

17

cept that she knew that people knew that she drank a lot.

18

That's the only point on which she knew what her reputation

19

was in this city and she didn't know whether it had changed or

20

not since the posting.

2!

So* I don't think we have —

22

Q

There were two causes of actionhere; weren't

24

A

Yes,

25

Q

And the first one was for damages?

23

there?
It is only the second cause of action,t\:

22

1

2
3
4

5
6

A

Against the chief of police for acting

arbitrarily under the statute -Q

But not for defamation? not for causing

her embarrassment or ridicule?
A

Yes*

Her reputation was mentioned in the

seventh paragraphof the first cause of action»

7

Q

And that has not yet been to trial?

Q

A

That’s correct? yes*

9

10

That cause of action

is still pending in the Eastern District.
Q

And I understood this passage in the court’s

1?

©pinion to which you referred simply that as a passing

12

reference to soma interest of Mrs. Constantineau being affec­

13

ted, the court apparently realizing that the interest in

14

drinking alcohol is not a very much protected interest by

15

virtue of the complete control that is given to the states

16

over that matter and that it was necessary for the court to

17

identify some interest that was affected by this?

13

A

I think the court had to find some interest

13

which was affected in order to find the statutes unconstitu­

20

tional, because it’s clear as we look at this Solely in terms

21

of the regulations of alcoholic beverages that the statutes

22
23
24
25

are constitutional so that the court had to come up with some­
thing and it came up with this point of reputation and it’s
my point to this Court, the State’s point that this right of
reputation is not at all in the operation of these ^atutss and
23

1

should not be accounted for in the balancing test,

2

Q

The first count is —

3

A

The first comit is still pending :in the

4

courts; yes.

5

So, it*s ray point, if the Court please, before this

6

Court, that this whole point of reputation is — should not

7

be put on the balancing scale of due process, if you please,

8

for the one reason that it3s not involved in the record of this

9

case in any way; that the statutes in -their operation by their

10

own terras, don't in any way involve the right of reputation,

11

and also as a matter of constitutional law if we look at -the

12

other cases, and 1 am thinking of Mr. Ramsey Clark the other

13

day, before this very Court, talking about reputation.

14

there he was taking about a - case where the man had been

15

severely damaged.

And

IS

There has been no concrete showing of any sort

17

that the economic future or the economic interest of Mrs.

IS

Constantineau have in any way been affected by the operation

19

of these statutes and that she does not have viable economic

20

alternatives as a result and after the posting which took

21

place under these statutes.

22

And —

23

Q

of whatever he goes to a bar to get

24

without a notice in the hearing, when the state can*t have a

25

law with which permits him to be deprived of his wages without

24

a notice —

A

on the balancing --

4
5

Wells, I think wages are far more important

Q

Is that all there is to it?

Is that all

there is to it?

6

A

My point, Mr. Justice White, is that if you

7

look at this balancing scale between the interests of the

8

Government and the interests of the individual, if you look

9

at it solely in terms of ~

10

Q

Well, the state can deprive him of what the

11

state thinks is unimportant, but what he might -think is vry

12

important?

13

A

Well, not on ~ Mr. Justice White, not

14

only what the state thinks - butin my opinion., what the

15

interests which have been affected inthe other cases which I

16

have cited in my brief, which are far more substantial in­

17

terests than is involved in this case in the right to obtain

13

alcoholic beverages.

19

I think the right — the so-called right, it's not

20

in the right privilege sense that l8m using it.

2!

we compare the balancing in this case, the due process balan­

22

cing, with the due process balancing which has occurred in oth^r

23

cases in which —

24
25

Q

I think when

What if — do you think the state could just

post a man and say, and tell all of the department stores in
25

1

town: "Don’t sell this many any more shoes?”

2

A

I would say not shoes , but ~

3

Q

Well; why not?

4

A

The. right of the individual to —

5

Q

6

A

Why not?

Are those so important?

Well, I think, Mr. Justice White, 'that the

7

-- in tills case the right ©f the individual to obtain alco­

Q

holic beverages is traditionally a very frail one in the con­

9

stitutional sense.
Q

10

Well, what if you posted, send the notices

11

that tell the story: "Don’t sell this man any more shotgun

12

shells?"

13

A

Then we have to go through the balancing

14

process all over again.

13

Q

Well, what about it?

I say the state has a much diminished power

Would you say that —

25

to regulate shotgun shells than it does, Mr. Justice White,
than it does —
Q

You’d say you ought to have notice and a

hearing before you could be deprived of buying shotguft shells?
A

Well, 1 think each commodity would have to

go through this balancing test itself and I couldn’t say
whether’ — ites not up to me to say

whether alcoholic be­

verages or more or less important than shotgun shells, and I
think the courts and the law traditionally, especially since
26

i

the passage of the 21st Amendment has shown -that the right

z

of the individua}, to obtain alcoholic beverages is a very

3

frail right* and that if we look at these statutes purely in

those terms* then clearly* even the majority in the lower court

5

would —

Don't you have to say that the right to

sustain your case?

A

I don't think so* Mr. Chief Justice.

20

so great in the area of alcoholic beverages --

23

Q

It8s got to be absolute if you don't have

to give any notice.
A

X don't think, if Mr. Shief Justice please,

24

that the other cases have shown that to be the case at all,

25

that — and I cited cases in the field of regulating business

and the right of public employees to — the right of an

point which I ended the brief on -—
Q

11

Mr. Southwick, I have just -one question on

12

that point: suppose the statute said that the chief of police

13

has a right to send the following notices that, Joe Doakes

14

has bean declared by me to be a public drunkard and for that

15

reason you are ordered not to sell him any intoxicating

16

beverages?

17
18
19

A

I think that would differ from this in­

stance, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

With the exception of using the words,

20

"declared by me a public drunkard," what is the difference?

21

It's under Aa particular statute and can't I assume that

22

every liquor dealer knows what the statute says?

23

A

I don't know that you can make that assump­

24

tion, Mr. Justice Marshall? clearly not by the terms of the

25

statute can you make that assumption.
28

The statute merely —

Wellf what are the rules in which the chief

2

of police can tell you that you can’t serve liquor to Joe

Doakes?

What other possible reason could it be?

Presumably it would only be for the reasons

set forth and as set forth ~

A

And you give it to all these third persons

Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't know that the

10

notice as contemplated in these statutes in any way provides

19

for any defamation in the sense that it merely says that

20

they are forbidden to sell to this individual.

conclusions the recipient might draw *— not within the terms

If it did, Your Honor, Justice Black, it

with respect to the Twenty-first Amendment.

13

if it was relevant, which the State has brought up, it would

16

certainly be a factor on their behalf.

17

That would be,

I think the counsel has been focusing the matter

18

on procedural due process, but I think we should look at the

19

nature of the State's action.

20

against a cifcissen who is not a public figure nor public

21

official and the power to do this is vested in those people

22

with merely discretionary powers.

23
24
25

Here the State is moving

An administrative official, administerial official
-- in this case the chief of police, his discretion is almost
unrestricted.

A lessening of your estate, or the misspending

1

of your estate is one of the reasons that he can do this to

a

this lady.
Q

Have yon published the state law on which

he can exercise that power?

Well, on your constitutional right, while

we are pausing for a moment, only last, in the 1969 term,

lass than a year ago, the pertinent Federal constitutional

S3

claims were raised by some people in the fishing business in

14

Alaska.

have abstained from considering it untilthe state courts had

construed, the State Courts of Alaska had construed their own

18

And this Court said that the District.Court should

Why shouldn't the District Court here have

19

abstained until the State Courts of Wisconsin have decided

20

what this statute meant?

21

A

Because, Your Honor, Mr, Chief Justice, I.

22

think it is well established in the law that when a substan­

23

tial Federal question is raised and a three-judge court is

24

convened, that court can in its own discretion, listen to the

25

issues presented.
33

1
2

Q

Well, but would you negate the abstention

doctrine entirely?

3

A

Well, 1 would not negate it entirely, but

4

I would rather put it in a discretionary manner with the

5

United States District Courts, especially when there is a

6

three-judge court.

7

matters that if we had gone into the state courts first and

8

exhausted our remedies there and then went to the Federal

9

Courts, there is nothing but a revolving door process and. the

You know we can always run into the

.i

10

only one who is getting exhausted is the Petitioner of the

11

Plaintiff and the Court; not the state remedies.

12

So, to facilitate what may ultimately be the end

13

result we start out in -the Federal Court where there is dis­

14

cretion and where this three-judge court and Judge Reynolds,

15

particularly, saw the reason to exercise that discretion.

16

And there are cases which we cited in our brief that to the

17

lowercourt and motions to dismiss that support our position

18

that it is a discretionary function of the three-judge

19

district court to hear the merits if there is a substantial

20

Federal question.

But we have to look at the nature

of -the state

as one of being a stigmatic identification of a citizer

who was not a public figure

2

the effect on that is to single out the citizen with a spot­

3

light with an unfavorable connotation»
Q

4

and not a public official and

Would it make any difference if this was the

3

mayor of the town of Hartford, since you emphasized the public

6

official.

Would he have a different right from this lady?
A

7

He would have — there would be a right to

8

criticise his actions, his behavior, because he is a public

9

official under the New York Times rule.

10

Q

Could you criticise him by posting him?

11

A

Under this law the chief of police could if

12

he dared to do so, but the liability of the chief of police

13

might be different because the mayor is a public official and

14

under the New York Times rule a public official is subject

15

to criticism in any part of his life which is a public matter.
Q

IS

That might affect his direct damages, but I

17

can't see what it would have to do with the constitutional

18

issues involved here.
A

19

Well, under the First Amendment, we have to

20

remember, Mr. Chief Justice, that free speech and with respect

21

to the criticism of public officials is something that is al­

22

most, well it is the last thing

23

absolute.

24

This Court recognised in -Mapp and it recognised in

8

Stanley versus Georgia that the physical enclosure of a home

is going beyond the enclosure? it is going into the heart and

not only when she is in her home? it's in her heart and her

13

soul and attached to her when she leaves her home.
Q

14

It's imposing a stigma on her,

Mr. Schapiro, aren't there limitations to

15

what you just said, they won't be permitted, in most s&hfces,

16

anyway, for being a waster of --Q

17

Well, he can be prosecuted in Wisconsin

13

for nonsupport. If he is, then of course he is given a due

19

process protection of hearing before a judicial forum where th«

20

facts are

21

before any findings are made; cross-examination is permitted.

l

Q

22

and counsel is presented.

There is a hearim

If a state had a statute — you say that you

23

think that Wisconsin does not have the dram statute — let's

24

say

25

tender the power to decide that a given person has had enough,

that within a state which had a statute giving the bar­

36

I

or too much, then hasn't the state vested in that bartender,

2

not only the power, but the duty to, in effect, stigmatize

3

him by saying, "I'm not going to sell you any more»"

4

A

Weil, it hasn't ~

S

Q

Those statutes would fall too, wouldn't they

6

7
8

9

under your theory?
A

Not unless a public declaration of the fact

would b® mad® —
Q

Well, it;s protty“public if he says it in

10

the bar with 29 people lined up at the bar, that "I'm not

11

going to let you have any more drinks.

12

A

You have had too much»

But then, Your Honor, it’s the citizen's

13

own act of becoming intoxicated that's discredited himself?

14

not the bartender.

15

Here is a woman that's a divorcee.

She's got four

16

children; she has never been convicted of a crime.

She's

17

never been convicted of being drunk and here the chief of police

13

is going out on his own and trying to limit her rights without

19

a notice of a hearing and in a manner calculated to cause her

20

damage with the rest of the community with whom she lives.

21

Nov/, the bartender, if he says so, the One that's

22

asking for the drink is responsible for his being refused by

23

becoming intoxicated in the first place.

in the ayes of the chief of police»
Q

Do you think that the state, under the

3

Twenty-first Amendment, could pass a law saying that no liquor

4

was to be served to any woman that had children?

5

A

I don't think that that would be possible,

8

Your Honor, Mr, Justice Harlan, because that would deprive

7

that woman of the equal protection of the laws, whereas others

8

in her family, others in her same position, without children

3

would be permitted to consume liquor and having children wc

10
11

not be a valid criterion for denying it to her»
So, it would be my position that that would be a
deprivation—
Q

Mr. Sehapiro, you heard the Attorney

14

General's position about this word "posting,” as it appears in

15

the statute and as it is used.

IS

A

What is your idea of it?

My idea is that the notice, since it was

17

served in the manner of a process server serving a notice, is

18

■that is appears on the wall of the tavern to give notice to all

19

persons? that they cannot sell —

20

Q

2!

on the wall?
A

Is there anything in this record about being

No, there isn't, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

Marshall; there isn't.
Q

That appears to be what Judge Reynolds

understood; page 112 of the appendix.
38

"In every

1

city saloon in Madison she could have your name on the wall."

z

'a

Well; Your Honor; Mr. . Justice Stewart,

3

and when this case comes to trial those facts will be estab­

4

lished and made part of the record»

5

Q

WEll, the case is over? isn’t it?

6

A

No , Your Honor —

7

Q

As far as you8re concerned it’s over?

8

A

It's not over at all, Mr» Justice —

9

Q

On the constitutional issues?

A

The constitutional issue has been decided

12

Q

The judgment has been

13

A

Yes, but -the question of whether or not the

n

4

and —

notice was actually placed on the wall or whether it was just

15

handed, is not going to be decided.

10

past which will be determined —

7
8

well that’s over.

Q

Those are issues of fact

Well, why would you declare the statute to

be unconstitutional on its face, then, until you find out how

19

it's going to apply, because on its face it doesn’t say anythi rg

20

about posting.

21

your contention is that you must construe — that the statute

22

was validly declared unconstitutional on its face because you

23

must assume these notices go on the wall.

24
25

A

It says "mailing a notice," and I think that

Well, they can be invalid without them

actually being put on the wall because the fact that they
39

1

are disseminated throughout the community, a person has no

2

chance to meet the inferences before they are disseminated»
Q

3

Mr. 5chapiro, would you be content if the

4

Wisconsin statute now had incorporated in if a provision for

5

hearing?
A

6

No, I wouldn't, Mr. Jus&ce Blackmun, for the

?

reason that this statute is inherently aimed toward the poor

8

in the community, because they are the ones who, the obvious

9

ones who would be restricted because they are the ones who

10

would be lessening their estates and leaving others to support

11

them.

12

The wealthy in the community who could spend all

13

they wanted and more and hot have their estate lessened and

14

others in the family deprived of their support would not be

15

touched by this law.

16

against the poor in the community.
Q

17

And therefore

I feel it's discriminatory

Does this suggest that y>u have never placed

18

a wealthy person under guardianship for tendencies of this

19

kind?

20
21

22
23
24
25

.

A

Well, a wealthy person, Your Honor, can be

placed under guardianship, but I think that in any such event
there would have to be a finding of incompetency by a tribunal
With cross-examination rights of counsel, hearing and notice.
Q

Has there been some reason why this first

count has not come to trial?
40

i

A

Well, the reason, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

z

Brennan, is that the state appealed this case to this Court

3

and the stay of appeal in this case and the determination of

4

the facts by this Court as to the constitutionality of the

5

statute, that is the reason, I feel, the lower court has not

6

further proceeded in this matter.

7

Q

Well, even if the statute were constitutional.

8

I suppose that damage action might be possible , for the

9

manner in which it has been administered.

19

A

Yes, Mr. Justice White, it is our position

11

that under those circumstances, nonetheless, it is state

12

action involved here and any state action under the Civil

13

Rights Act which this case is proceeding under, give rise to

14

a cause of action.

15

There might ba a difference if the law is uncon-

16

stitutional and malicious or negligent in the posting of these

17

notices, but the — this case would, nevertheless, be

13

to proceed to trial.

19

allowed

It is our position, generally, and as a closing

20

comment, that the rights of the Plaintiff, the Appellee here,

21

are rights of privacy and rights to her own name and reputa­

22

tion which are — which could be included in the Ninth Amend­

23

ment or in the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause alone,

24

or under the incorporation theory under the First Amendment.

25

Because, her right to remain a nonpublic figure, to live her
41

i

own life in

her own quiet way is generally an aspect of

2

privacy, and the state forcing her to become a public figure

3

is a deprivation of her right of privacy.
And we likewise have the question of reputation

4

5

involved in this matter because — 1 just want to make this

6

as my closing comment ~ I wanted to go into detail, but I

7

will just say that the stigma attached to this,creates an

a

outcast group in society and -that outcast group is forbidden

9

by its own nature to have any associations with other groups

10

in society»

11

and as a result their rights of association are limited and

12

this is not the right of association in a political group that

13
14
15
16
17

petition the government for a redress? this is a —

posted person to b® unaffilistable and unassociatable with all
segments of society, except those in the outcast group which
she has involuntarily become a member of.
Q

22
23
24
25

Is there any indication in the record at

all as to how many people in the town were posted?
A

20
21

such a

basic right of association that it would inherently cause fchh^

18
19

'People will tend to shy away from 'these people?

It's not in the record, but out of the

record, this is a eommon practice by the chief of police in.
this community.

There are maybe seven or eight a year like

this.
Q

I suppose he could post everybody in town.

A

Certainly, 'the discretion is almost

42

1

unlimited.

The criteria is, as applied to this case, because

2

this woman is not dangerous to the community, which is one
i

3

grounds, which is the lessening of the estate, the misspending

4

of money.

5

official without notice and hearing is one such instance of a

e

violation of not only procedural, but substantive due process.,

And I think that in the hands of an administer!al

7

Q

Why didn9t you go into the state courts to

8

try to get some relief?

9

A

Well, we saw that there was no remedy by

10

certiorari in the state courts.

11

and certiorari would only be permitted to re%riew the actions

12

of an administrative tribunal.

13

Q

14

procedure in Wisconsin?

15

A

I looked into that matter

Have you got a declaratory judgment

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Harlan, there is a

16

declaratory judgment procedure, but that will not cause the

17

chief of police to take the notices down.

18

Q

What about an injunction?

19

A

An injunction would.

20

Q

And damage actions?

21

A

An injunction and damage

action would cause

22

the notice to be taken down but the likelihood of success in

23

the damage, Mr. Justice White, in the state courts would be

24

much more difficult than it would under the Civil Rights Act

25

where there is definite state action.

43

Under state law there would probat»ly be a

1

2

requirement of proving matters beyond state action and as a

3

result it was our position that it would be an easier damage

4

action to prove in a Federal action under the Civil Rights

5

Act. o

Thank you.

the posting unpost him?
A

He did in this case when, the lower court

ordered him to but whether or not he could, the statute
doesn9t provide any mechanism for him to do so and if it was
it would be inherently his own discretion.

answer your question further than that.
