It is interesting to not© in this regard

The District Court rejected that plan because in its
estimation it did not take cognizance of the Center Township

The District Court’s judgment in this case that the

District Court based its judgment is that fewer legislators per

22

Q

Didn't they reapportion the whole state?

23

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Why did it find it necessary to do that in this

25

situation in this one area?

Well, that is a matter of some speculation. Your j

Honor.

3

The primary holding in this case
well, first of all,
:■
you have the District Court’s decision in '65 which had already

4

passed on the constitutionality of the ”65 Act under the one-

5

man one-vote principle of Reynolds.

6

Mow, ajong came this case five years -- four years

7

later and the court looks at it and says,

8

this court has changed its standards.? secondly, we now have a

9

new theory, the Bans hat* analysis that multi-member and single-

"Well, first of all,

...

10

member districts inherently are unconstitutional.
The court went from the finding that these defendants,

U
12

these plaintiffs were invidiously discriminated against,

13

went from that finding to the conclusion that the entire state

14

had to be reapportioned.

15

to why the whole state had to be reapportioned.

16

Court specifically said when one Marion County is sub­

17

districted there will be unallowable variances.

13

eit her it was now apportioned — well, you have legislators

19

per persons on there, it is going to be the same after you

20

reapportion as it was before.

21

wasn't.

22

they

There is a complete gap in there as
The District

But that is

Either it was okay before or it

But the District Court already said it was.
Q

Well, wasn't the theory that as illustrated by

23

the Marion County situation, multi-men®er districts,

24

court concluded were invalid constitutionally, and that is what

25

led it to reapportion the entire state?
9

the

I

A

Yes, that is exactly the way theywent.

E

Q

Again, by seeing the effect of the mu 1 ti--member

3

Marion County district effect on this ghetto area --

4

A

Yes, Your Honor.

5

Q

— and that led to the conclusion, the District

6

Court conclusion that multi-member districts generally were

1

constitutionally invalid, and that in turn led it to look to

8

the rest of the state, and it found that in Lake County and

9

elsewhere there were multi-member districts and that is what

10

led it to the statewide reapportionment.

'I?

A

12

Q

13

A

14

Q

That's right.
Wasn't that it or have 1 got it wrong?
I think that is what happened.
1 thought the court would have reached the same

15

result and redisfcrict the whole state even if it had not found,

16

looking at Marion County along, that the multi-member district

n

cancelled out the voting power of some group.

IS

A

19

Q

Well -I though the court would have said multi-member

20

districts as multi-member districts give multi-member districts

21

too much power.

22

A

Right.

23

Q

Compared to single-member districts.

24

A

Right.

25

Q

So they could have reached reapportioning the
'Y;

t

whole state result without identifying any particular group

z

within Marion County as having been disenfranchised.
A

3

That would have been a reason to reapportion the

4

entire state.

3

necessarily --well, I guess it follows that Marion County would

6

have to be sub-districted because it is the largest district in

7

the state.

8
9

Q

That would not have been a reason to sub-district

All multi-member districts would have had to be

taken apart.

10

A

Right.

One of the problems

11

Q

Did the court go that route or not?

12

A

I think they did.

I think they did.

An inter­

13

esting point of that position is that the court only found in

14

favor of Mason Bryant, who was a member of the multi-member

13

district.

16

court is going to find that someone’s rights have been violated,

17

it has to have the man before it whose rights have been violated

18

Mason Bryant, under the court’s analysis, was over-represented.

19

The court had no — well, the court has found in favor of no

20

before it in terms of having being under-represented.

21

court went both ways.

22

There was no member -- the court didn’t -- if the

The

In the invidious discrimination argument, breaking up

23

the Marion County district, the court found that Mason Bryant

24

was under-represented.

23

court found that Marion County was over-represented.

Applying the Bans haf analysis, the

11

They tried

1

to have it both ways.

2

To reach the court's decision in this case, as the

3

Marion County multi-member district, it had to first section off

4

a distinct area,and then it had to provide some means or basis

5

to compare that area to another area.

6

what it called statistical analysis which I won't treat here

7

because I feel that 1 have adequately treated it in the brief.

8

But I feel that the statistical analysis that the court applied

9

amounts to gross speculation, that the Center Township Negro

10

To do that, it conducted

area amounts to a separate distinct area within the county.

n

The second step which the court used was to compare

12

the ratios, the ratio of legislator per person of the Center

13

Township Negro area to the Washington Township area.

H

this, the township lines, the township boundaries,

15

that are being compared have to have

16

cance o

17

sorb

To do

these areas

political signifi­

Implied in the court's decision is that somehow

18

residents in Washington should be better represented but a

19

legislator from Washington Township doesn’t represent all of

20

the legislators in the county, but somehow only represents the

21

residents in Washington Township.

22

Washington Township are specially benefited by having legis­

23

lators elected from there, that somehow Washington Township

24

legis lators do not represent residents of the Center Township

25

Negro area.
12

Somehow the residents of

i

The record repeats those conclusions.

All the plain-

2

tiffs in this case, Mr. Chavis was a resident of Washington

Township.

represented the interests of the Center Township Negro.

record in this case shows that a legislator living outside of

the Center Toitfnship Negro area can represent the interests of

the Center Township Negro.

As a matter

23

He said the laws are

kind of problem.

That is another

Our concern here is whether these people are

In this same regard* Chavis also testified that the

interests of the Center Township Negro were served, with

counted with the residents of the rest of the county, with the

S

residents of the rest of the state, that it was counted with

6

Negroes living in areas outside of the Center Township area.
The significance of this is that if the interests of

7
8

the Negroes living in Center Township are not being served or

9

pushed along, fully being taken care of, neither the interests

10

of the citizens of other areas of the state.
in this same regard* we have only to look at the

statutes of the State of Indiana, the welfare laws, some con­

that you can think of that the plaintiffs in this case claimed

for it.

17

I think that is an example of the fact that their
interests have not been ignored in the Legislature.

19

Q

The law provided for what?

20

A

Well, the District Court says that the Center-

1 didn't hear you.

21

Township Negroes have compelling interests in things like urban

22

renewal and welfare legislation,

23

education, health, and so on and so forth.

Mr. Thompson, do you take the position or is it

true in Indiana that the Legislature has nothing to do with

Can you state in a nutshell -- if you can't^ why,

just forget the question --- how did the District Court go about

10

exercising this function of reapportioning the whole state?

11

Who did he consult?

Who did he have?

Well, with the Marion County --

Did the legislative, did the political powers,

14

the political ranks of the government participate in it at all?

To this extent, Your Honor, the legislative

they were not parties to this action?

9

A

Oh, yes, quite clear.

Well, as the action started out, it was initiated

against the — against all of the legislators.

This Court has uniformally condemned all such attempts

and should do so in this case by reversing the decision of the

District Court.

9

The other issue I want to bit upon briefly is the
Banzhaf issue, the striking down all multi-member districts un­

10

constitutional per se.

It has always been thought, it has been

11

implied and accepted that although a voter in a multi-member

12

district has an advantage because be had more representatives

13

from which to -- for whom to vote, that this advantage was

U

offset by the fact that he was part of a larger electorate

15

competing with him, to vote for these individuals.

16

This has been challenged by John Banshaf and others.

17

Banzhaf's analysis briefly is that voters in the Marion County

18

multi-member district were over-represented vis-a-vis smaller

19
20

multi-member districts and single-member districts within the
'
state. There was an inherent disparity, and it was based on

21

rather comples? mathematical equations which he devised.

judgment to the effect that there is in Marion County, Indiana,

22

residing therein which has substantive interests which

23

diverge significantly from those of the county as a whole, and

that as a response to those interests it engages in a vote

pattern which diverges significantly from that of the county

A

Yes, Your Honor.

What happens to the rest of the state?

9

A

In the rest of the state they would be allowed

10

to break up no county for purposes of drawing Senate seats

under the Indiana Constitution.

12

Q

In other words, whet the federal decree does

i3

is preserve the ground rules for the one-man one-vote rule,

14

the principal rule per se?

15

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Also there would be a great

16

problem under this for them to draw Senate seats without

17

crossing county lines, but they could certainly draw multi-

18

member district Senate seats without breaking up counties.

19

And unless the supremacy clause requires the breaking up of

20

counties in the Indiana Senate, there will be multi-member

21

districts in Marion County, in Lake County of different size

22

in the Indiana Senate.

people of equal protection of the lax*, and it says hence those

18

portions of the present legislative apportionment statute

19

relating to Marion County relating to both Senate and House

20

are unconstitutional and void.

21

practical remedy for such unconstitutional deprivation of

22

voting strength is the elimination of the large multi-member

House and Senate districts in Marion County.

The court finds that the only

And he goes on and says that they will be single

A

There is a good reason for that, Your Honor,

They wanted to give every legislator -Q

12

There may be good reason, but the fact is that

13

you are suggesting that the holding was that, if I get from

14

what you just said, the legislature is still free to construct

15

multi-member districts so long as they are a smaller number of

'16

members from each district.

17

A

18

Q

Throughout the state.

19

A

Right.

20

Q

21

But when they came around however constructing

your own plan for Marion County —

22
23

Yes, and so long as they are uniform.

A

Ho, for the entire state they did single-member

districts.

Q

Is what the court

plan

25

A

Is what they did,

yes.

40

I

Q

And you say there is an explanation for that?

2

A

Yes, they wanted to set up rules in advance so

3

that different groups could participate and propose plans.

4

The needed rules such that a comparison could be made between

5

plans, so they made the lease political decision and just

6

said all single-member districts and we will take the plan

that is best that has the least operation deviation, which is

8

what they did.

9

than one percent throughout the state, and that was the pur­

10

The operation deviation turned out to be less

pose of it.

11

And I would like to turn immediately to the question

12

of uniform* districts and why we believe they are constitution­

13

ally required in Indiana.

14

in the lower court, it was uneontradicted and both sides

15

affirmatively presented affirmative proof that when they «are

16

in the Indiana General Assembly, multi-member district dele­

17

gations, at least that one from Marion County, vote en bloc at

18

the behest of the party organization, and that they do not

19

vote on their own, and that there are very few variances.

20

There is a very strong presentation

It also was proven that they are elected en bloc,

21

that during the past forty years only twice has a member of a

22

party which lost generally in an election got elected to the

23

Indiana General Assembly from Marion County, Indiana.

24

the other elections, with those two exceptions, either one

25

party slate or the other was elected.
41

During

The evidence also shows that during rail primary elec­

1

2

tions in recent memory, the official party organization slate

3

was nominated to run for the Indiana General Assembly, and

4

that persons not supported by the organisation slate were not

5

nominated in such primaries*

6

The evidence also shows that those persons who be­

7

came on the organisation's slate were thoroughly controlled

0

by the central committee of the party organisation, and so in

9

effect this multi-member district delegation which is and

10

has historically been elected from Marion County is a unit

11

rule delegation controlled at one source.

12

This has two results.

This demonstrates that

13

parochial interests, such as those of a ghetto area, could not

14

realistically be represented.

15

who had been the sole black Senator in the Indiana General

16

Assembly, during the past ten years, represented that he

17

could not effectively represent his people because he had to

18

do each time on each vote what his county chairman wanted him

19

to do.

20

past members have done on rollcalls, voting constantly en bloc.

2!

And Pat Davis, the plaintiff,

And we presented evidence showing what present and

This is pertinent to the dilution of black people

22

in the ghetto area of Marion County, Indiana and is also

23

pertinent to the District Court's finding that multi-meraber

24

districts of differing size can be inherently unconstitutional.

25

What it amounted to was that the proof showed that
42

1

the multi-roeniber' district delegation is the same as if you had

2

weighted voting, because they voted as one in Marion County.

3

It is the same as having one representative with 15 votes, -

4

and one from Lake county was 11.
Q

5
6

Is there any claiming or finding in this case

of racial discrimination as such?
A

7

Ho*

The history is that we have never had

8

single-member districts and have never broken up any county

9

for any districting of any kind in the General Assembly in the

10

history of the State of Indiana.

11

12

member districting.

13

in Indiana, multi-member districting existed.

A

Ho, we did prove otherwise and we didn't try

very hard to prove design.
Q

7

It has been my impression, in the absence of

0

racial discrimination as such, our cases have held that the

9

sort of considerations that entered into the district court's

10

decision were not only not required by the Constitution but

11

that they were prohibited by the Constitution.

of cases such as Harrington vs. Rash, that you couldn’t

regulate the franchise, depending upon your prediction as to

how people were'going to vote.

matics.

19

I am thinking

I am thinking about Wells vs.

Am I mistaken in my reading of those cases?
A

Ho, that is what these cases say, and I will

20

quote Burns vs, Richardson and'we brought this entire action

21

based upon what those two, the majority opinion of this Court

22

and almost unanimous opinions in one case, said, and those

23

are the two decisions we are specifically relying on, their

24

language and what they said would count as a good redistrict­

ing ease.

Even though they would nevertheless have the

10

A

The only thing is there

There would be no invidious effect because there

would be no effect.

The districting would not affect their

interests at all.
Q

II

Yes, but their interests may not be effected.

12

I mean their interests wouldn’t be any more effectively repre­

13

sented than they are now.

That is correct, so there would be no remedy

to us and we would have no case.
