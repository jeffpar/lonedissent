ORAL ARGUMENT BY SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, OFFICE

7

OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

8

MRc HUNTINGTON: • Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:

9

This is a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals

10

it

Act from the United States District Court from the District of

12

Columbia.

13

District of Columbia abortion statute on the grounds that it wan

14

unconstitutionally vague on its face.

That Court struck down a major provision of the

Coming back to — in the District of Columbia,

15
16

charging Appellee, Dr. Milan Vuitch, who is a licensed physi­

17

cian, with procuring or attempting to procure two abortions in

18

violation of Section 22-201 of the D, C. Code.

19

makes it a crime to procure or attempt to procure an abortion

20

"unless the same were done as necessary for the preservation of

21

the mother6s life or health."

That section

Appellee’s motion to dismiss the indictment©was

22

23

granted before trial by the District Court on the grounds that

24

the quoted phrase was unconstitutionally vague.
The record does contain no development whatever of

25

3

I1

1

any of the facts bearing on the charges contained in the in­

2

dictment.

3

Qur basic position in -this Court is that the

4

District Court erred in striking down the abortion statute for

5

vagueness on its face»

6

allowed to stand is that there is new no limitation

1

District of Columbia on the performance of abortions by physi­

8

cians .

3

The result of the Court's decision if
in the

We believe that under a proper interpretation of the

W

statute there is a definite class of situations to which the

n

statute can be applied without running into vagueness problems.

12

For this reason we think the case should be remanded to the

13

District Court for further proceedings.
Before reaching the merits of the District Court's

14

IS

ruling, however, there are certain jurisdictional questions

16

which this Court has requested the parties to brief and argue.

17

They are as follows? first, does this Court have jurisdiction

18

over the direct appeal under' the Criminal. Appeals Act, notwith­

19

standing the fact that the underlying statute applies only '

20

within the District of Columbia.

21

Seconds could the Government have appealed this case
s

22

to the Court of Appeals under Section 23105 of the D. C. Code?

23

That section gives the Government the same right of appeal that

24

is given to the defendant.

23

haveappeaied to the Court of Appeals, should this Court, as a

And third; if the Government could

4

1

matter of sound judicial administration, abstain from accepting

2

jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act?
First let me point out two significant developments

3
4

since the time we filed our brief.

5

the D. C. Reform Act and the Amendment of the Criminal Appeals

8

Act.

7

was signed into law last July and it becomes effective February

3

1st of this year, jurisdiction over 8,any criminal case

9

any law applicable exclusively to the District

Under the D. C. Court Reform Act, which became law, or

17

Columbia.

24
25

of Columbia

Appeals from that Court will run to the District

Court, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals» which, of
course, is not the Circuit Court of Appeals.
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is the
Court of record and its judgment would be reviewed by this

Court in the same way that the state court judgments are reviewed.
Of more immediate impact and perhaps of conclusive

13
19

under

would by mid-1972 rest in the Superior Court of the District of

14
15

These are the passage of

impact on direct appeals, of course, is the amendment of the
Criminal Appeals Act which abolishes direct appeals to this
Court.

Now, that does not apply — it applies only to eases

begun, and by that we interpret that to mean begun by indict­
ment, after January 2nd of this year when the law was signed.
So, that law does not apply to this case.
effect of these two laws, we submit, is to make the
5

But, the

1

jurisdiction&l issues presented here* issues which do not have

2

ongoing significance.

3

Well, turning —

4

Q

Does that mean it doesn't make much differ-

5

@ne@, as a practical matter, whether we take jurisdiction or

6

not?
A

7

No? I' believe it does make a considerable

difference whether you take jurisdiction in tills case.

3

I just

mean that the issues you decide here, the jurisdictional issues,
do not have overriding significance in the future.

10

Q

11

Well, I put too much into my comment then.

12

We ought not to worry too much about the jurisdictional ques­

13

tion question and just accept it? is that the thrust of the

14

argument?

IS

A

That8s the Government8s position.

18

Q

Well, X thought it was that any jurisdic­

tional decision will be of very limited precedential value and

17

would be in the light of the statutory changes.

18

1

A

That's right? that's true.

20

Well, turning to those issues now, the old act as

22

it applies to this case, states that an appeal may he taken by
/
and on behalf of the United States from the District Courts

23

direct t© the Supreme Court from the decision ©f judgment dis­

24

missing any indictment where such decision or judgment is based

25

upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which

21

S
i

1
2

the indictment is founded.
Q

I take it it's your position that -that applies

3

even to a statute restricted in its application to the District

4

of Columbia?

5

A

Yes? that's right.

8

Q

As it stands in contrast to one which is

"

7

applicable throughout the country in which the normal District

8

Court elsewhere would have to deal with?

9

A

That's right? yes.

We believe that Congress

10

perhaps could have made a distinction between a statute appli-

If

cable only within the District of Columbia and statutes of

12

nationwide application but that Congress did not make that dis­

13

tinction to it.

14

Q

Certainly It is true that on the state's side

IS

we have entirely separate criminal procedure which channels its

16

way up to the S&te Supreme Courts.

17

ing with a local statute which conceivably, it could be argued

13

anyway, should go up t© the Court of Appeals rather than here?

19

A

And here we have, are deal­

$@11, that's certainly true.

I 'think an

20

analogy can be drawn to the review of the challenging of the

21

state statutes by a Three-Judge District Court® Under that

22

statute this Court has interpreted the term "statute," to mean

23

— in that Three-Judge District Court provision— to mean

24

statute of statewide applicability rather than a local statute.

25

We believe -that this

was not carried over to the

7

1

Federal area in the case of Shapiro against Thompson, involving

2

the welfare residency requirements in the District of Columbia»
V

3

There this Court interpreted the statute there:

4

28 USC 2282, which said that the constitutional challenge to

5

an Act of Congress applicable only to the District of Columbia

6

must be heard by a Three-»Judge District Court»

7

decided that any Act ©f Congress included an Act of Congress

8

limited in application to the District ©f Columbia,
How, I would suggest that at the time of Shapiro

9
10
11

This Court

there perhaps were arguments for restricting the scopa of that
phase.

They were rejected.

The Court stated they could see no

12

reason to draw that distinction and we submit that that is

13

dispositive of this issue here.

14

The only other phrase in the old Criminal Appeals

15

Act which we can see would perhaps lead to some doubt as to

16

whether this Court had jurisdiction, is the term.: "District

17

Court," as to whether that includes the District Court for the

18

District of -Columbia,

19

said in our brief there®

20

the statute was originally passed it did not include that term

21

Mow, we have nothing to add to what we
We concluded in our brief that when

it did not apply to the District of Columbia.

It %?as amende*

22

in 1942 to specifically mention -the D. C. Circuit Court of

23

Appeals and it has been interpreted by the Court of Appeals and

24

by this Court that that amendment had the effect of making the

25

Criminal Appeals Act applicable to the District Courts®
8

We

1

don't believe that is a substantial issue.

z

Well, coming to the second point that is whether

3

this 'eoust has jurisdiction — whether the Government could
•i

4

have taken this case to the Court of Appeals under D. C. Code

5

Section 23-105.

6

amended and as of February 1st it's part of the D. C. format —

7

as of February 1st it's now 23-104 and the section is reworded

8

and much more specific.

9

material effect on this issue.

10

I would point out that that sectis®has been

We have assumed, at the time we brought this appeal

11

her©, that our only choice was to com® to this court.

12

was because in Carroll against the United fetes, this court

13

reviewed the overlap of the Criminal Appeals Act in the 0. C.

14

Appeals provision, and concluded that the explicit directions of

15

the Criminal Appeals Act will apply, might apply to the same

18

case.

13

this court in the United States against Sweet.

But, in its opinion, this Court

Well, assuming that it can be said that it would,

7

And so the case was sent back

the question then becomes whether this Court should accept
jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act, notwithstanding
the fact that both statutes might apply to this case.

We sub­

mit that the — because the Criminal Appeals Act states that
»

f

n

an appeal may be taken by the United States to this, Court, that

12

this is an appeal as of right, and this Court lacks discretion

13

19

20

to reject, to refuse to take the case.
Q

Well, really that was not, as you just

stated, that this Court .should accept this appeal, but rather
that this Court must accept this appeal; is it not?
even though it may be that you could have app

of Appeals for 'the District of Columbia, nonetheless, having

your brief, that this Court has no power now to transfer to the

Court of Appeals and must accept jurisdiction ©f‘this appeal
under the statutes»
A

Only in a very limited sense where appeals

very obviously lack merit or lack — are not based upon a sub­
stantial Federal question, has this Court construed its

25

10

1

appellate jurisdiction to be discretionary»

question when it's an act of Congress? can we?

7

A

Correct.

3

Q

Mr» Huntington, was there ever a United

9

States District Court in 1907?

10
11

A

Ho? it was the Supreme Court of the District

of Columbia at that time.

12

Q

Suppose theSupreme Court

ofthe

District of

13

Columbia in 1907, or 1908, had done what was done here by the

14

District Court? could that case, in a dismissal of that indict­

■15

ment, appeal directly here?
A

IS

Slow, in United States againstBurroughs,

17

this Court specifically said that the act could not apply to

18

the Supreme Court.
Q

19

Does that have any relevance?

This statute

20

we are dealing with, I gather, is the 1907 version? isn't it?

21

not the 1942 version?

22
23

simply established the Government's
11

1

fight of appeal to the Courts of Appeals.

But the Govern­

2

ment 5 s right of appeal directly to this Court derives only

3

from the 1907 statute? doesn’t it?

4
5

A

Well; that's right; but I think you have to

interpret the statute in the light of the

6

Q

amendment

Well; my question then is that if that’s so?

7

does the fact that you could not have come here directly from

8

a dismissal of an indictment by the Supreme Court of the

9

District of Columbia# does that bear on the construction we

10

ought to give the 3731 in its 1907 — ?

11

A

It certainly does bear on it.

The Court of

12

Appeals and this Court in Carroll# acknowledged the decision in

13

Burroughs and concluded that the effect of the '42 amendment

14

had been to open up direct appeals

to this Court from the

Now# if this Court wishes to reexamine those

IS

Well# turning to the merits of the District Court’s

19

ruling# I will state again that our basic position is that the

20

District Court should not have struck down toe statute on its

21

face.

22

there is a distinct classification to which it can be validly

23

applied? namelys we believe it can be applied where a doctor

24

has made no attempt to determine whether or not health reasons

25

exi± which would justify an abortion.

We believe that under any interpretation of the statute

12

1

Q

You mean validly apply as far as vagueness?

2

A

As far as vagueness is concerned.

3

Ism

limiting my discussion right now to the vagueness point,

4

Appellee argues that in view of the constitutional

5

stature of the rights that he asserts and the impact which the

8

statute has on the practice of medicine , he should be allowed

7

t© attack the statute on its face.
This Court has afforded standing in certain First

8
9

Amendment cases to attack a statute ©a its face and it’s

10

presumably on these cases that Appellee relies.

11

leading case in that area is in Drabrowski against Pfister where

12

a subversive activity statute of Louisiana was struck down by

13

this Court.

14

tion .

15

Of course the

We submit that this is not the Dombrowski situa­

We concede, of course, the point that Appellee

16

stresses in his brief that there are many physicians in the

17

District of Columbia who are dissatisfied with the abortion

18

statutes and that perhaps many more abortions would be per­

19

formed if the statute did not exist.

20

we don°t believe 'that that establishes that the rights asserted

2!

are of such constitutional significance that the statute should

22

be struck down on its face.

23

But, by this concession,

Just comparing this case with Dombrowski, first the

24

constitutional rights asserted here, are novel and for the most

23

part, unexplored.

We submit they should not be determined in

category of casea»

Second? as 1 stated? we believe there is a

In Dombrowski it is very questionable as to

Finally? in Dombrowski the conduct of those chal­

7
8

lenging the state statute was not of the hard-core type which

9

will be prohibited by any reading of the statute»

Here? only

10

the development of a record will demonstrat© whether Appellee's

11

conduct was of the hard-core type or not.
Assuming? however, that Appellee*should ba allowed

1E
13

to attack the statute on its face? and reach the merits of the

14

District Court holding that the statute v;as unconstitutionally

15

vague? it is our view that the District Court misconstrued the

10

statute and that under a proper interpretationi the statute is

ty

not unconstitutionally vague»
Of great concern to the District Court was the

18
19

possibility that a doctor would exercise medical judgment and

20

determine that health grounds justified an abortion? and that

2!

this judgment could then be subject to being second-guessed

22

after the fact? by first a prosecutor and then the — ultimately

23

the jury»

24

1933 decision of the Court of Appeals in Williams against the

25

United States»

This concern follows from the Court's reading in the

The District Court read that case as placing the

We submit that Williams did not hold that»

7

who had the burden of raising the issues.

8
9

his trial — neither side pro­
The total issue in that

In affirming the conviction the Court of Appeals
merely held that the burden of raising justification as an

10

affirmative defense was on the physician.

11

Williams is consistent with the proposition that the ultimate

In our view,

b urden of persuasion is on the Government, and remains on the
Government, once the issue has been raised.
Q

Well, wouldn't it almost follow, then, on

your reading of the act that whenever an abortion is performed

by a licensed physician in good standing, and the mother sur­
vives in good health, -then it8s a legal abortion under the
statute as you read it?
A

If the doctor makes a good faith judgment,

exercises medical judgment —
Q

Well, I assume now a licensed physician in

good standing in the profession — that is not under any dis­
ciplinary cloud — performs an 'abortion, doesn't it follow in
your reading of -the statute that that's not a criminal act?

13

broad scope in determining what health is, but we would sug­

22

I think 'the doctor — if the doctor merely determined that the

his good faith could be placed in doubt —

should think that the reading that you* yourself * give to this

A

Ohs of course.

We don't believe -- we believo

21

that if a doctor merely performed an abortion on demand on a

2Z

woman's request solely on the woman's request, without deter­

23

mining that special conditions separate that woman from the

24

general class of women — of pregnant women — that special

25

health grounds separate that woman from the general class of

because of the fact o£ pregnancy, performs an abortion on her

exercise of his professional judgment, experience and skill?
A

No.

Appellee does argue

'that because — and

he cited statistics to show that the abortion operation, at

IS

least in the first trimester is safer than proceeding to term

16

21

certainly the standard of health that Congress had in mind when

22

it adopted the statute, would involve a risk to health which

would be greater than the risk of the abortion at that time.

applicable to vasectomy?

A

Not that I know of? no.

But wouldn°t you suggest that the Government,

if it is prosecuting a doctor, would have to do something more

18

on its side of the case than to show that an abortion was per­

formed?

17

A

Well, this issue, I believe, does not have to

be decided by this Court.

19

Q

Well, it may nothave to be decided, but it

sounds to me as though you think the Government’s prlraa facie

case could be limited to showing that the abortion was per­

with respect to the jurisdiction of this- Court,

that the abortion of an embryo before the 20th week, before the

33

1

Q

In this evolving developing stag© of medical

2

knowledge on the subject that both of you have alluded to, how

3

would we form any — how would we have any basis to pass on

4

that, absent a record of testimony as to what is the present

5

6

state of medical knowledge on the time and the term?
A

Your Honor, my answer would be twofolds

7

first, I believe that it would be an enormous problem of

8

judicial administration to deal with every variegated facet of

9

the 'abortion area on a case-by-case basis.

That is to says

10

the authorities which have been cited in our brief and in th©

II

Government8s brief, the statistics, the material, the medical

12

knowledge, all of it is available.

13

now, if in each case where a doctor, and I feel strongly that

14

it's an unjust indictment, that if a doctor were indicted we

13

would have to send the case back in order to find out in each

16

instance, what his justification was for performing a particu­

17

lar abortion, Your Honors would never be able t© decide th©

18

tremendous ©f instances that occur in medical practice.

19

It's before Your Honors

So, the first part of my answeris that this is not

20

a subject matter, in my humble opinion, which can be dealt with

21

on a case-to-case basis.

22

On the second level, 1 would like to suggest to you,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, that there is hardly any are© of criminal

24

law more unique than this.

Yes; have otherwise# as well.

4

I was going to say that the Three-Judge Court in the

5

Hodgson case originally held that the statute was not in

jeopardy because a doctor had not been indicted.

7

very hopeful, Your Honor, that in the great state ©f Minnesota,

8

the same enlightenment opinion will result that has resulted in

9

other great states.

But, 1 am

I feel very strongly that the proliferation, the

n

multiplicity of suits which will be reaching — are reaching

tz

this Court now, could be 'very deftly and intelligently

13

approached by a decision here.

14

Q

Well, my intimation there merely is that

15

if that is the

16

developed because there has been a trial with testimony,

17

medical and otherwise, in contrast to this one.

case, if it ever comes here, which is fully

Yes, Your Honor.

on trial, evidence has been adduced, he is required t© corae

22

acts and the jury has either accepted ©r rejected these justi­

23

fications, which 2 think is a matter of serious area ©f con­

24

stitutional infirmity.

25

But there are some cases where Three-

Judge Courts up in Wisconsin, Mr. Justice, have said that the
3€

statute is unconstitutional on its face, because in the case

of the Wisconsin statute the court said in the doctrine of

3

Griswold and other cases in this Court that.' a woman has an

Mr. Nellis, how about the ground onwhich the

What 1

meant to say was that under those factual circumstances where

a woman would not be examined medically * that would probably

take placa in a back alley or in a back room where many abor­

24

tions are performed because of the abortion laws in the United

10

Judge Peters in the first case» reaching the conclusion that a

The word "necessary" —

The word "necessary" was commented on by Chief

Justice Taft as long ago as 1926 in the Trinidad case» which is

23

quoted in our brief» in which he said if is a word of great

24

indefiniteness and it°s objectionable in the permanent statute.

45

i

Clifton Meadows (?) the Dean of the Alabama Medical School,

z

entitled: "The Mind of the Physicians," pointed out to a legal

3

audience: "Uncertainty is the part of the life of every

4

physician," and it goes on to give numerous examples of how

5

it’s impossible frequently for diagnoses, for medical judgment

6

to be solidly based.

7

where precision is low, in his language, and error is likely.
Then he goes on to say: "Unfortunately, often in

What may appear to be negligence to a

Can't you say all those words regarding mal­

practice generally?
A

Well, 1 would say that malpractice, which is,

18

of course, an important problem to physicians, as an important

19

a problem of this, but raises a different question.

20

the question of whether or not a physician is living up to the

21

standards of his profession.

22

It raises

In this case we have a criminal statute which forces

23

him to guess what the word "health" means and it puts him in a

24

wholly different position from the man who is being judged

25

against the standards of the profession.
46

For example, in this

1

case, just to amplify that pointy there is no suggestion, as

2

far as I know, that Dr. Vuitch did not live up to the standards

3

of his profession in terms of care, in terms of exercising

4

normal physician skills.

S

Q

It's difficult for me to accept your ex­

6

planation because, and I shouldn't go on my own experience,

7

but I have seen physician after physician after physician say

S

the same thing about malpractice that you have just said, and

9

I might also say, drawing on my own experience that I have

30

known many physicians who are not concerned about the sword of

II

Damocles in this decision-making and who are courageous and

32

make the decisions if they have to.

33

So that I take it what your argument comes down to

14

is that fundamentally it applies to the profession as a whole

13

and that there are, o£ course, exceptions.

16

That's right,

I think it applies who have

17

taken the burden of making a medical judgment in the face of a

statute of this kind.

statutes the doctor is put into the position where because he

say: it's too risky to do this surgery and then he refrains

10

If he wants to be this very cautious practitioner and '

from doing the surgery.

11

Now, is that any different —

'12

A

The difference, I think, is that in the mal­

13

practice case there is a well-established standard by which the

14

professional judgment of the physician is being evaluated.

15

This Sfeatitifce, neither in its history, nor in its language,

16

suggests what that standard is.
Q

17

Professor Dorsan, isn't one of the standards

18

of the medical profession with respect to surgeons, that

19

surgeons are not to perform operations that are not required by

the health of the patient?

That is correct.

A

I might add that much of our brief covers

19

this fully, but to indicate the difference between the conven­

tional malpractice situation and the very special kind of

21

situation that physicians are faced with here, that this past

22

summer the American Medical Association and the American

23

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the

24

American Public Health Association, all voted in favor of

23

having criminal penalties for abortions removed.
/

50

Jn other words, I am suggesting that the phsyician

1

2

who takes it upon himself to operate on the woman in the

3

abortion context, is not departing from what seem,

4

present standards of the medical profession, as recently

5

stated this past summer in one case ~ I think it was in

June —• and one case that was in August»

to be the

Now, I think, turning to a point that the Govern­

7

9

Mr, Dorsen, may 1 interrupt you one more

n

regard these questions as hostile»

12

interest in the subject matter.

I think it's a matter of

Is it not true, or I suggest that the average

1.3
14

physician and certainly the operating surgeon also have another

13

avenue which he must bear in mind, and that is the investiga-

16

ting team sent out by the AHA, the American Hospital Associa­

17

tion and the AMA, checking records to see whether there is any

18

unnecessary surgery going■ on.

19

20

So that, speaking of your sword of Damocles, not
only is the criminal aspect here, but also professional stan­
dards which bear upon him.

21

22

And I merely mention that the

criminal aspect is one, but are there not these other factors

.

23
24
25

which have some significance?
A

They certainly do have significance and we

are malting no suggestion — I hope none is related to what Mr,
51

1

Nellis or 1 said regarding the continued applicability of the

2

professional standards»

3

What we are speaking about is the criminal law coming in in

4

this kind of practice with a vague criminal statute and im~

5

posing additional sanction to what you talk about and the one

6

that Mr» Justice Whitehas talked about.

7

Q

We feel these should be applied0

Welly I would suggest that in the abortion

8

area, probably, investigation by AHA and AMA teams is probsibly

9

more acute than in almost any other area»

10

A

A further consequence of the statutes of this

11

kind is what seems to be the unfortunate application of the

12

laws concerning abortion in a way which operates differently

13

against the poor than the rich»

14

The statistics in the District of Columbia which are

15

cited in our brief and are found in the medical journals with

16

respect to other jurisdictions, suggest that in Europe where

17

people without funds get their medical treatment» the number of

18

abortions that are performed is significantly less, frequently

19

one-fifth as many as in private pavilions.

20

f

Now, I mention this, even though the facts are not

21

here in the record, because there is a case that was decided

22

in the District of Columbia in the Doe case, which is cited in

23

our brief, by the D. C. General Hospital which indicates the

24

special problems of poor people in getting an abortion.

25

A second important, perhaps ultimately precise a
52

1

factor here is the consideration that Judge Gesell did lead to

2

did not decide? but did allude to? and that is the right of

3

women to have an abortion.

4

Underlying this case? in our judgment? is a basic

S

constitutional right recognised by Judge Gesell and he did not

@

rule on the point specifically and by courts in many other

7

jurisdictions that it is a right of a woman to make her own

8

decision? unaffected by the criminal law of the state? whether

9

or not to bear a child,

We are not making the claim of any stage in this case.

But it is not necessary for us to go further than that

Q

You say it is not necessary to go that far

insofar as you are talking about vagueness?
A

As far as vagueness is concerned? but not in

19

terms of the ultimate question of whether or not a woman is

20

entitled to an abortion at every point up to birth.

21

books on the subject? as 1 understand it? ©nee the embryo

22

reaches a certain state then it isn't called abortion? it is

23

called induced labor and it becomes a somewhat different

24

medical problem, as 1 understand it.

To draw a distinction.

A

Yes.

It is, and we are making the claim, as

Q

It’s not then, the right of motherhood? to

foe a mother or not to foe a mother?

she has dominion over and which this Court should protect.

Do you give any status there or posture to

And from then on I — maybe

Well, I think if the doctor is exercising

medical judgment because a disease situation or there is a

situation that he would feel that he should do it, I then would

say that she could do so in an unrestrained way,

20

Q

If you have trouble with the arm I think you

21

would have trouble with the abortion, especially in a fortiori

if you even thought that the unborn child had some rights.

I would think that this court —

I might say in connection with the very point that's

being raised here, that Mr, Justice Clark, now retired, in an

3

article in the Loyola Law Review, 2 Loyala Law Review, dealt

4

with some of the same problems that are before the Court now,

5

And he concluded, after discussing the issues, sayings "I

submit that until the time that life is present the state

7

could not interfere with the interruption, of pregnancy through

8

abortion performed in a hospital under appropriate clinical

9

conditions»"

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY SAMUEL HUNTINGTON,

MR * HUNTINGTON: I would first like to refer to the

question of Mr. Justice Blackman at the end of my argument

7

about the question of rubella.

8

hasty in my response to that question, that that would not be

9

grounds for an abortion.
I think that if there is a substantial chance that

I think perhaps I was too

there may be a defect in the fetus that it could quite possibly
be that psychiatric grounds would exist for justifying Idle
abortion in that case.

Obviously, the prospect of raising a

deformed child would have a very definite traumatic effect in
a woman and I think that would be in the realm of the psy­
chiatrist to determine professionally what that effect would be.
