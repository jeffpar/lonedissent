MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL W. BROWN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS

8
9

MR. BROWN%

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;

10

We have here a case which involves mercury pollu­

11

tion in the Great Lakes, an immense problem which has become

12

more immendse as we have factually realised that the mercury

13

pollution is extremely damaging to health and life of our

U

citizens.

IS

Now, we address this action

o the original

16

jurisdiction of -this Court under Article 3, Section 2, Clause

17

2 of the Constitution and we think that the Court has, in an

18

exceedingly clear way, outlined the cases in which such an

19

action is proper.

20

We think that Georgia versus the Tennessee Copper

21

Company is extremely in point and that New Jersey versus New

22

York is extremely in point, in that each of these cases provide

23

in a single factual situation that this Court will hear a com­

24

plaint so addressed by a state against the citizens of another

25

state and against the residents of a foreign country.
3

i

Mow * in, each instance the facts are identical in

2

that: acts were committed the status of which was outside of the

3

complaining state, but which created a nuisance within the

4

state and -this Court here being for the purpose of enjoinment»

5
0

Q

the Tennessee case?

7
8

What law do you think -the Court applied in.

A

In the Tennessee case I think it applied the

common law of the ~~

9

Q

Common Federal Law

10

A

No? the common law of the State of Georgia»

11

Q

But there was some discussion of that matter?

12

wasn't there, about what

13

A

It

seems to me that here --

U

Q

““

about what would be the actual law or —

IS

A

It

seems to me here ~ it hasn't occurred to

m

rae that we could apply in this case anything- except the common

17

lav? of the State of Ohio where the nuisance occurred»

18
19

Q

But you are claiming under a Federal statute

A

No? we axe not claiming under a Federal statuti!

action?

4

!

We are filing this under the common law of the State of Ohio

E

and addressing our complaint as was done in these other two

3

cases

»

5

Well, didn't your complaint 'say that the

defendants had violated Federal statutes?

0

7

Q

A

Mo, sir? it does not.

If it does, it wasn't

intended that it should.

8

Q

So you are strictly sealing --

9

A

A common --

10

Q

A Federal form to have adjudicated a cause

it

of action under Ohio law?
A

12

13

16

And our right to do so arises from

the Constitution and from these two cases and only

14

13

Right.

.from that.

Q

You think we are obligated to apply Ohio

A

I think you are obligated to apply Ohio

law?

17

common law with regard to whether or not this constitutes a

18

nuisance and I think you are obligated to apply Ohio common law

19

to questions of damages which may arise in the case.

20

Q

May 2 ask you a question, Mr. Brown?

21

A

Yes.

22

Q

At the time this suit was brought, it was

23

brought by you, as Attorney General of the State —

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

— so, of course you had the power to bring

You are no longer Attorney General and did the state so

We rather enjoy being confronted by the defendant I

IS

’ saying it9s impractical for us to remove this mercury from the;

17

River St, Clair and the Detroit River,

because metallic mercury there in the river is at the point '

where it ’was discharged into the River by Dow Chem, has been

22

industrial debris at the bottom ©£ that river,

23

Ites there.

The things we have learned in the last few years

24

is that this metallic mercury, by the action of the small

25

living animals at the bottom of that sludge, in the absence of

stated in Massachusetts versus Mellon.

There are some other cases which the Defendant

argues, which do not apply.

set up a number of straw roan.

The defendants in this case have
They, as polluters, have tried

desperately to use every measure to continue to pollute.
Q

What would you — what is your reaction —

18

it may not go t© jurisdiction, but in terms of the injunction

19

phase ©f the case, what’s the significance to the fast, if if

20

is a fact, that Wyandotte has ceased to pollute and that Dow

21

Chemical of Canada is under an Ontario order to hold its pollu­

22

tion down to a certain level?

23

■ &

These are factual questions which we will get

24

to on th© merits' w@ do not think they have ceased to pollute.

25

In fact, we have indications that Canada does not think that

13

I

they have ceased to pollute and that Canada is about to file

2

further judicial action there.,

Welly let us assume it were true that they

had stopped polluting completely.

that; for failure to state a claim ©r something else,
A

If we fail to prove our case; then of course,

19

we will lose, but we have to prove that they not only have

20

polluted, but that pollution continues®

21

In addition to this, metallic mercury, concen­

22

trated at the point at which the effluent is dumped into the

23

river by Dow and by Wyandotte, is still there on the bottom

24

©f the river and is still being released by the passage of

25

water over it and it is still being acted upon by bacteria
14

\

1

throughout the lake® so that we continue to get pollution,

2

which was caused and brought about by their original action.

8

In addition to that this proceeding is going to

4

have to b® constantly monitored because the amount of sewage

S

and other ishd&f&rial waste that is in the lake made by other

6

changes, began to react upon -this metallic mercury, and in the

7

ever-increasing rate so that we may get a higher rate of

8

mere-ary pollution in the fish themselves without the addition

9

of any additionalmercury,
Q

10
11

Well, I suppose there are sources of mercury j

besides these particular defendants?

process ©f making caustic soda and chlorine is the process

14

which provides by far the greatest percentage and amount of

Thera are,

W® believe the evidence will

clearly show there are a© other substantial polluters; that

20

these people are the only substantial polluters in this par­

21

ticular area and we believe that if there are other substan­

22

tial polluter we would be delighted to have the defsndanfcs

make them parties after we are in her® on the merits',

It does go to the merits -Which would become, if as or when this motion

And I am afraid that the judgment with regard:

to my motion may turn upon your anticipation of what the merits-

And hence, I must strongly state that the facts are with

Well, I. would assume that under ordinary

concepts ©f pleading, we had a motion to file a complaint and

1!

that we could assume the allegations in the complaint are

12

true for the purposes of that motion»

13

A

That5& right? that's right*

14

Q

But the real problem here, our initial

15

problem and what the argument on this motion was directed to,

16

I should suppose, would be the jurisdiction of this Court*

17

There is no jurisdiction.

18

doubt about jurisdiction under Article 3, Section 2 and action

19

by the state against citizens of different states»

20

in answer to my Brother Harlan 1 understood you fc© say that

21

it is your position that the Court had absolutely no jurisdic­

tion in this area.

the Court should allow

But, under the cases which have been written ,

under the constitutional laws on the books we are entitled to

18

with answering is the question of the exact shape and form of

19

the final decree in tnis Court, which is also something we must!

20

reach when we develop all the factual background.

Q

Just t© get back to what 1 had thought and

22

is really the only thing before us, and that"is the motion fco

The United States has filed its brief amicus

view as to whether in this particular case the Court should* as

Q

A

We can do anything*

And one thing which might have been mentioned:

while there are these prior cases which point in very much 'the
same direction as ~ of Ohio9s complaint* but New Jersey versus
New York City* particularly has a remarkable factual -- with tho
asserted fac^s of the complaint her®»

Those cases were all

decided before the Federal statutes and before the prominence*
at least* of perhaps certain matters under the Boundary Waters
Treaty* were bound to that in any event* and this Court in its
23

1

opinion in those cases„ albeit after the matters had been

a

decided,, was quite emphatic about how they would rather have

s

Federal statutes ©r some kind of conference procedures or some-

4

thing of the sort and it seems incumbent upon us t© address

5

ourselves as we have in our brief? to the questions whether

8

indeeda those statutes foreclosed a remedy in this Court and

7

t© give .-the Court the types of information that it might wish

8

to use in exercising its discretion.

-

9

Q

Mr. Strauss? for a moments where d© we get

10

our discretion to refuse to hear a case that is within eur

11

jurisdiction?

12

j

What is the theoretical basis for that?
A

I suppose what we are speaking of her© is a

13

case which is not only within this Court8s '.original jurisdic­

14

tion? but also within the original jurisdiction of another

15

court.

IS

Q

Yes.

17

A

That when the Court's jurisdiction is ex­

18

clusive and original the Court quite properly could be said not

19

to have jurisdiction? but when it believes that there may be a

20

remedy in another court something on the order of doctrine of

■

.

21

foreign non convenience? which I think quite appropriately -

22

takes into account the other responsibilities that this Court

23

has and that ~-

An injunctive remedy for nuisance is common in

1

The Court did such a -thing in

I may say we do have some difficulty with the

19
20

claim of Ohio for compensatory damages, but it doesn't seem to

21

us that that claim is necessarily excluded from this Court's

22

jurisdiction.

23

as Mr. Brown points out, because it was clear that they were

24

intended for the benefit of particular individuals.

:

25

In the past the Court has rejected such claims,

In North Dakota versus Minnesota, in particular,

27

!

the state segregated its claim: it was $5,000 for us and a

2

million dollars for the fanners who were paying the expenses

3

of the litigation»

4

we really don't know how Ohio intand-s to use the money, which

IS

is the key.

Now* there is no such differentiation here?

6

It may be remarked in the first place that Ohio

1

has an undoubted proprietary interest here and we can’t say,

8
9

as could be said in North Dakota,

The North Dakota case

proportioned that proprietary interest as to the damages that

might be assessed.

17

been suggested by commentators that an appropriate way of

18

calculating monetary relief in such circumstances, and perhaps

19

the simpler one, is to assess the damages which have been done

20

and then to use those funds for that removal purpose and it

21

certainly doesn't seem to me excluded on the complaint that

22

that’s what Ohio would do»

23

24
25

I would suggest, and it has

Certainly it ought not to foe the case that because
the one of the funds is so hard to compute and so immense in
amount that the polluter should simply go away scot-free»
28

And finally, I would point out in this regard thafcj

'J

E

if Ohio were using the funds in this particular way,.aa a means;

3

of remedying the nuisance it couldn81 be claimed, as the '

4

defendants do, that there was some risk of double recovery,

3

because although the measure might be the same as could be

0

obtained in a suit brought by an individual, the use and the

7

remedy would be entirely different»

■

I come now to the principal area ©f controversy

3
9

of importance to the United States and that is the possible

10

liability of Dow Chemical of Canada or of its parent, Dow

11

Chemical Company, for acts done at the company's Canadian

12

factory whose effects are felt in the United States.
These two companies appear quite strongly to

13
t4
15
16
17

insist that any assertion of jurisdiction by this Court might
provoke an international incident or undercut an international
treaty.

And we want to make it plain that it is the view of

the United States that no such consequences would occur.
The power of American Courts to the

18
19

20

__

courts whose effects are felt on American soil is, we believe,
indisputable.

;

The companies also raised certain doubts re~

-

2!

22
23
24
25

garding whether the Court would provide an effective remedy.
These go, essentially to matters of discretion, but we d© point;
out certain respects in which more facts are needed before
final conclusion, can be reached.
Let me begin with the issue of liability.

29

I

1

think ail of us would agree on a simple case in which issues

2

of causation are not obscured? the case of the individual who

3

is standing on one side of the Niagara River? fires a rifle

4

across it and kills a person on the other side.

3

in which the individual was murdered is able to secure juris-

6

diction over the person of the sniper? and that of course is

7

not a question that5s here today»

The situation is the same if? instead of sending

on the other side of the river»

Again? to the extent a public

nuisance may be prosecuted as a crime? there could be no dispute? that the recipient state may prosecute the individual if
it may obtain service on him for that crime»
A Canadian court would feel as competent as an
American court in those circumstances and the only way an inter­
national incident could arise would be if some improper means
had been used to secure jurisdiction over the defendant or due
process was somehow denied and ©£ course, both of which we are
quit© certain will not happen in these proceedings»
Thera might be some question whether a judicial
decree obtained in a civil proceedings would b© enforceable in
the courts of the other jurisdiction»
30

That is? we don't — we

diction.

13

The suggestion is made that the fact

14

that this is a public nuisance suit here makes the difference.

IS

I think the argument is essentially that only the United States

16

could bring an action for public nuisance against a person who

17

is resident in a foreigh country and producing a nuisance from

18

that point as if only the United States could prosecute the

19

sniper on the banks of the Niagara. River for a murder which he

20

causes in New York State.
I think, to state the proposition in that way is

21

22

the answer.

Under the Constitution the states are forbidden

23

from engaging in diplimaey, but Ohio doesn91 seek to involve

24

the Canadian Government in any respect in this case.

25

charge is an offense to its domestic laws felt on its own soil,

and requested the United States to take this matter up with the

Canadian Government as a diplomatic matter.

15

Smelters case in British Columbia.

Ohio might have come to the United States

That was done in

But, this is merely an alternative on a required

17

mode of proceeding and as we set out at length in our brief,

18

the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 provides no mechanism for

19

the mandatory resolution of pollution disputes concerning

20

boundary waters.

21

In this connection I think I ought to correct a

22

misapprehension which Dow Chemical of the United States at

23

least has with regard to the Boundary Waters Treaty#

24

twice mention Article II of the treaty as if it had some bearing

25

on this case.

They

It may be found at page 3-A and 4-A of the brief
32

■

1

of Dow Chemical of Canada»

2

That article applies — well* I think perhaps the j

3

quickest way to do this is to suggest that three different

4

situations that one might have across the Canadian-American

5

boundary»

We have a river that runs across the boundary that
i

'i

6

may be interfered with upstream or downstream.

1

may have waters- like Lake Erie which sit on the boundary.

8

waters on the boundary are designated boundary waters under the j

9

treaty»

10

And then one
i
CtaXyj

j
Article II provides as to a river which runs

11

across the boundary that if someone on the upstream end of it

12

interfered with its use and that might conceivably include

13

pollution although it has never been so adjudicated* then and

14

in that circumstance only* a downstream individual may come

15

into the courts of the upstream nation and litigate in that

16

forum the issue of the damage which is done to him and is en-

17

titled to have that litigation resolved in his favor under the

18

laws of that nation and if ha were a citizen thereof.

3

19

Now* that is a specific remedy and if that were

20

applicable in this case Ohio would be able to go into the

21

courts of Canada and get relief against Dow Chemical.

22

not applicable here because we are dealing with boundary waters ;

23

not a river which crosses the boundary-

24

Ohio has a much less certain remedy I would say* than it would

25

have if Article II applied.

33

It is

And the result is that

j
|

*

1

Nonetheless, the failure of the treaty to deal

2

with that situation, in the view of the United States, does

3

not at all exclude the possibility of the remedy which Ohio is

4

seeking today»

5

in international law and there is nothing in the treaty which

6

excludes, it seems to us, the principles stated by this Court

7

in New Jersey versus New York City is equally applicable here»

8
9

The remedy which Ohio is seeking is recognised

"If the defendant is before the Court," and I am
reading from page 482 of Volume 283 of the Court's opinion»

10

"If a defendant is before the court and the property of plain­

11

tiff and its citizens that is alleged to have been injured by

12

such dumping is within the Courtas territorial jurisdiction,

13

the situs of the acts creating a nuisance, whether within or

14

without the United States, is of no importance."

IS

I will turn very briefly to the problems □£ en­

16

forcement which chiefly, as I think this Court has already

17

recognized, should await later resolution.

18

The first observation is that to the extent that

19

money damages are possible there is really no issue about en~

20

forcement; nor is there any possible disability regarding this

21

Court's power to get injunctive relief so far as that injunc­

22

tive relief applies on this side of the boundary.

23

has jurisdiction over Dow Canada's person it may enjoin Dow

24

Chemical, requiring it to remove the mercury from the American

25

half of the St. Clair River and the Detroit River and Lake Erie,
34

If the Court

And there should be no question of this Court's power to do

that.

3

There are* I think* some problems involved with

granting injunctive relief which would necessarily take effect

conclude that that were necessary it could fairly apprehend

as Dow does* that Dow Chemical of Canada's conduct has been

wholly foreign and that therefore this Court lacks jurisdiction

Since March of 1370 our horizons of knowledge

with respect feo the problems of mercury pollution have expanded

like the universe.
In th© appendix to our brief of reply the Court

This report has been universally well-received.

In Canada? our Acting Prims Minister, Mr» Sharp, has committed ;

Mr, William P« Rogers ©£ your Government, has

There are technological limitations to the

selected by Wyandotte, and the fact

20

shutting that plant down, their escape is 1.2 pounds per day,

22

which escape, I tell the Court, is greater than the escape

continuing from my client’s plant in Sarnia, which is less than

And, if the Court would look at the draft

regulations of 'the Department of Fisheries and Forestry of the

mankind to shut off the flow ©f mercury from this type of an

17

One cannot refrain from ^©fersncsa to -the dictum
•

IS

..

of Mr. Justice Holmes in Missouri and Illinois, 1905, at page

19

542: "Whereas here the plaintiff has sovereign powers and

29

deliberately permits discharges similar to those of which he

21

22
23

24
23

complained, it not only offers the standard to which the
defendant has the right to appeal, but it warrants the defen­
dant, in demanding the strictest proof that the plaintiff's
own combat doss not produce the result.'3
Q

May 1 ask you how that applies?
48

1

How that applies?

2

Q

Yes o

It is my submission to the Court that the

4

State of Ohio can legislatively and can administratively and

own jurisdiction and if they do then the standard that they

12

I would like to make on© comment with respect to

13.

the brief of the Solicitor General where reliance is placed by

14

the Solicitor General on the case of 0» S» versus Aluminum

15
■16

17
18

Company of America and he also clearly mentions two cases to
the Court: Vanity Fair Mills and the T» Eaton Company and
Steel and Bulova Watch»
Itis my respectful submission that when those

19’

cases are examined carefully the only two cases which are

20

governing in the problem we’re confronted with is the Steel

21

and Bulova Watch case as amplified and explained in Vanity

22

Fair v» T„ Eaton Company.

£3

{

Because, in the Vanity Fair case you are dealing

24

with precisely the situation we have here of a nonresident

23

citizen of a foreign country, carrying on combat in that

49

I

1

foreign country subject to and regulated by the Governments of

2

that foreign country and the conduct ’which is approved of by

3

that foreign, country.

4

Now, by that Iam not suggesting to the Court that

S

my government approves pollution.

6

however, that my government, the government which regulates -the

7

company which I represent, has enacted regulations and has

S

an effective organisation called the Clear Water Resources

9

Commission, which regulates —- test samples and has approved of

10

I am saying to the Court,

the quality of the effluent escaping from the plant in Sarnia.

f!

And in those cases the principle would appear to

12

be that if the order of the Court is one which would infringe

13

upon the sovereignty of the foreign of a foreign sovereign,

14

the injunctive relief would have to be granted and the Court

15

has no jurisdiction to entertain injunctive relief.

I
-

17

Now, I do not quarrel with the proposition that

the law of Ohio may apply with respect to an action for damages;

18

That remark is directed solely t© the action that is sought to

19

be maintained for an injunction and for a mandatory injmotion.]

26

There is a second principle —

May I ask you; do you mean that if what was

A

S

I’m sorry; I cannot answer Your Honor3s

question.

S

matter is* in my respectful submission, governed bythe

I would say this to you, Mr. Justice Douglass the

It is my respectful submission that basic to this

10

case there is only one real issue and that is whether or not

the legislative jurisdictions of your government and my govern-j

raent „ the governments of the countries, the governments of th©

states, the provinces, whether they can avoid coming to grips

U

with their real responsibility, which is to adjudicate and

15

legislate and make decisions with respect to pollution.
New, they have responsibility and they have got

IS
17

ample powers-

Their powers are as great or. greater than this

18

Court in terms of executive power; they have administrative

19

capacities way beyond the administrative capacities of this

20

Court and they are the ones who should be doing the job.

•i

21

But, as to this action, we are in a situation

£2

where the State of Ohio and the State of Michigan are, if I

23

may respectfully submit, really shirking -their responsibilities

24

and seeking to place that responsibility onto' the Court.

25

the Court accepts responsibility, fills Court assumes
53

If

jurisdiction, the effect, to my respectful submission, ' is to

z

consign the whole problem ©f pollution in Lake Erie, which is

3

a very urgent problem, which the International Joint Commis­

Well, Mr» Outerbridge, 1 think that under

They must all be beforethe Court.

M

So, that

Ohio would b® completely without

No.

With respect, you can move for a simple

Yes.

In Ontario we could enjoin Ontario --

ORM. ARGUMENT BY HARLEY J. MG NEAL, ESQ

2

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT DOW CHEMICAL

3

COMPANY IN REPLY TO BRIEF OF THE

4

UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

3

MR. MC NEAL:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the
*

/

Court s

3
7

In our view, in light of the present knowledge

&

and expertise concerning mercury pollution in Lake Erie, it

9

is respectfully suggested that Ohio8s proposed litigation is

10

premature''and it may very well be ill-advised because of the'.

II

posters in which the complaint comes to this Court.
We have but three defendants, when, as my brothers)

12

.

■

13

have stated, there are many known polluters of Lake Erie:

14

mercury polluters, municipal government polluters, sewage,

15

phosphates? almost an innumerable number, including^ other

16

chemicals which are

11

polluters.

of expertise being found to be also
-

18

Sof in the Court’s discretion, which I believe

19

this Court has in this case, to consider the issues raised by

20

the complaint, X believe, with but three defendants, one being

21

a foreigner, this Court would be proper and right and just in

22

refusing to entertain Ohio’s complaint ©n the basis that the

23

complaint involves not only the judiciary, but it also involves

24

the political side of our government; namely: the executive

25

and the legislative branches.

j

l

56
;

1
2
..3

So that in the ekercise of this Court's jurisdic­
tion it is believed that this Court should examine carefully
whether the complaint ©f Ohio on its face demonstrates whether '

4

there is ©r is not a lack of satisfactory criteria which would

S

enable this Courts in the posture in which the complaint corves t

6

to make a binding judicial determination which would be deter­

7

minative of the problem of mercury pollution in the Great

a

Lakes, particularly Lake Erie, when we know New York and

3

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ontario also are interested in Lake

10

I!

■

1

Erie and its pollutione
It seems very difficult for me to understand how

12

this Court with the power that it has, would be able to legis­

13

late or make a judicial finding which would satisfy Ohio ins©-

14

far as Ohio’s common law is concerned, leaving open a judicial

15

determination of the rights and interests of the other states

16

and that of Ontariou

'

17

I

Further, I believe 'this Court, in the exercising*

18

of its jurisdiction and discretion, should ascertain whether

13

there are alternative .forums available which could, by reason

20

of their structure, reach a better determination in the long

2!

run and over a long period of time than the narrow confines of

22

a judicial decree in the posture that pollution now is, that

23

the state of expertise and the present knowledge that we have

24

concerning and the number of pollutants and the people involved,,

25

I say this because, t© me it is most important

57

,

?

that this Court consider the provisions of the Boundary Waters j
i

2

Treaty of 1909„ which is proclaimed by the two governments,

3

wherein it was stated generally that insofar as Canada and the 1

4

United States would foe concerned, pollution ©£ the boundary .

5

waters which occurred on one side of the boundary or the other,

6

which resulted in harm to the inhabitants of the other side,

7

would foe determined by means of an international joint commis- j
i
sion»

8
9

Mid the history of what the International Joint

10

Commission has done concerning investigation ©f pollution, I

ii

believe, is most important»
Beginning in 1918 the International Joint Commis-

12

13

sion handed down a report wherein in that report the Inter­

n

national Joint Commission was required to investigat® the extentj

15

causes and where the boundary waters were polluted so as to foe

10

injurious to public health and unfit for domestic and other

17

uses.

IS
19

j
In the 1918 report the International Joint Commis-j
I
sion concluded at that time that pollution was very intense

20

along the shores of the Detroit and Niagara .Rivers and that a

21

condition existed which would impair the health and excellence

22

and welfare of the citizens»

23
24
m

!

Mow, what have the two governments done since 19187
By two joint references, the executive branches ©£ the two
governments have referred the problem of pollution to the
58

!

International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters

2

Treaty»

3

Joint Commission to investigate pollution problems in the Sfc.

4

Marysf Sfc. Clair, Detroit and Niagara Rivers.

5

International Joint Commission reported certain water quality

;

S

objectives to restore and maintain the waters which they were

]

7

requested to investigate.

In 1946 both governments requested the International

j

And in 1950 the \

B

Q

Mr0 McNealf with what result?

9

A

:
The two governments approved the reconunenda- |

10

tions and this ^©suited in pollution abatement programs being

It

set up by various enforcement agencies in Canada and in the

12

United States.
.

13

as late as October 1964 by another joint

14

to the International Joint Commission, the executive branches

15

of the two governments referred an investigation of &ie waters

16

of Lake Erie insofar as pollution is concerned and by my

17
m

brother Mr. Outerbridge, you have heard him state that the
- ■
report concerning investigation of pollution ©f the waters of

m

Lake Erie was filed by the State Department wherein the Inter- |

20

national Joint Commission reported, and I think it is helpful

21

to summarize what the International Joint Commission found and j

22

reported» through the State Department of the United States,

23

which filed the report.

24
IS

The International Joint Commission found fc^at
until 1968 mercury was thought to be very stablei thatIt could
59

1

1

not be established with certainty that the concentration of a

2

particular pollutant on one side of the boundary is due to any

3

specific force on the other side*

4

Contaminants from both sides of the boundary are

5

affecting and degrading -the water quality of Lake Erie.

0

order to achieve effective pollution control the laws of the

7

governments interested in Lake Erie's pollution problems must

B

b© coordinated to a varied inaction and inconsistency»

&

In

The economic cost and social consequences of the

10

pollution problem will be a most difficult one to assess»

1!

International Joint Commission also said? “Studies are necessary

12

to find solutions to the legislative, legal and enforcement

13

problems related t© curtailing and eliminating the sources ©f

M

pollution *

15

The

"The solution of such social problems may well

16

prove as difficult and time-consuming as the solution of all

17

of the scientific and technical problems involved»"

18

This brings me to my points this Court exercising

19

its discretion inasmuch as there has been no emergency, inso­

20

far as Ohio is concerned, because Ohio within ten days after it

21

declared a fishing ban, lifted that fishing ban.

22

The only species of fish which may not b® commer­

23

cially fished today is the walleyed pike.

M

effect April 10th in 1970 and I believe as to most other fish,

23

was lifted on April 22nd, or thereabouts, 1970»
60

The ban went into

1

So that the commercial fishermen who were unable

2

to commercial fish and sell fish* were held up for a matter of

3

ten days»
The inhabitants of Ohio are not advised not to buy

4
§

fish? the commercial fishermen may sell fish and things are

6

going on insofar as the taking of fish from Lake Erie as they

7

did before,,

8

paper reports it has found that 87 of the -— 87 percent of the

9

fish that were harmed* indicating that they were commercially

10

unfit* within ten days after Olio had put a ban on commercial

11

fishing* were found to be well below the dangerous level of

It

methylmercury, which is said to be toxic insofar as humans are

13

concerned„

14

Now, why is -this?

Becausef at least in the news­

'

3© that my point is that if there is no emergency

13

insofar as Ohio8s position is concerned* this Court* exercising

IS

its discretion may well refuse to entertain Ohio's complaint

17

because Ohio has a basis whereby it may bring its action in

m

the Court of Common Pleas in Ohio? it may resort to the Inter-

19

national Joint Commission and contrary to what my brother* Mr.

20

Strauss* has said* I believe under Article IX ©f the Boundary

21

Waters Treaty which reads? "The exclusive jurisdiction and

22

control ©f the use and diversion* whhther temporary or permanent

23

©f all waters on this side of the line which in their natural

24

channels would flow across the boundaries or into the’ boundary

2S

waters are reserved to that nation.m

And that if there is some

3

i

i

i

I

1

damage resulting in any injury on the other side of the

2

boundary that nation that causes the condition shall give rise

3

to the same rights and entitled the injured parties to the

4

same legal remedies as if idle injury took place in the country , ■

5

in Canadac

.

So that I says my interpretation of Article II

6
7

that Ohio lias the right to use the good offices of the Ontario

8

courts to prevent this problem if they want to get at Dow

9

Canada»

They have a right to sue in their own jurisdiction in

11

the Court of Common Pleas in Ohio and under the treaty, Ohio hast
— ’*
the perfect vehicle to have an adjudication. And my brother,

12

Mr, Strauss, also said that under the treaty there are no

13

powers ©f arbitrations, yet in the Trail Smelter(7) case, which

14

is a landmark case, involving pollution where a company in

15

Canada was polluting the air in the State of Washington.

10

*

\

•

The

■

16

two nations, Canada and the United States, referred the problem j

17

to the International Joint Commission and the International

18

Joint Commission took testimony, learned about the issues and

19

reported back to the two governments with recommendations»
..

20

As a result of that investigation, at the hearings i

22

that were had, it was decided that a commission would be chosen
'
and a tribunal appointed and that tribunal proceeded to find

23

liability and to assess damages.

24

Boundary Waters Treaty.

21

25

This was all done under this
i
I

And under Article X of the Boundary Waters Treaty
62

1

it is provided that where there is a dispute between the

2

United States and Canada, the high contracting parties may

3

refer the matter to an umpire chosen in accordance with the

4

proceedings prescribed in the 4th, 5th and 6th paragraphs of

S

the Hague Convention, for the specific settlement of inter-

6

national disputes»

7

a final decision with respect to those matters and questions

B

so referred on which the Commission shall fail to agree*

Such umpire shall have the power to render

10

Treaty a provision whereby if the International Joint Commis­

11
12

sion so recommends to the two nations that there be a finding
■
of fault and a determination of liability, this can be accom­

13

Q

How does Ohio trigger action by the Commis­

A

By consulting the State Department? requesting

sion?

of the State Department that there is a problem involving
pollution of Lake Erie»

If the relief comes within the terms

and provisions of the Boundary Waters Treaty which will then
enable the State Department and the Executive Department of
Canada to consult on the matter and if they come to an agreement
refer to the International Joint Commission, which in turn,
will handle the matter to a conclusion*
And this has been done and the landmark case is
S3
i

the Trail Smelter case.

2

litigation which would be interminable by reason

3

information that one has to acquire; the scientific knowledge

4

that has to be presented? the witnesses who would have to be

S

subpoenaed, who would have to appear,? would seem to me to be

6

an improper forum.

To burden this Court with this kind
