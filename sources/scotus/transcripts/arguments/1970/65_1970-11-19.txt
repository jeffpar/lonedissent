12

MELD!Wl:

Petitioner's intervention, de=errnined that intervention should
be governed solely by this Court's deci~ion in Reisman versus
Caplin.

And the 5th Circuit narrowly construed the l<el.sman

decision to require that a proprietary interest or a privileged
relationship be established by the proposed ~ntervenor, before
2

1

he should be allowed to intervene in the case.

2

Secondly: the 5th Circuit h~:.d t! at the i_nter11enor

3

must shcu that if he would be allowed to intervene he could

4

successfully defend in the s,munons enforc ment proceedings.
The Court of .l!.ppeals found tr at Feti :ioner had not

In 1968 the Internal Reve1ue Service oegan conduc-

special agent had inquired at the Acme Circus Company and 1.-equested certain information and ccrtai1 documents.
formed

Mr.

Acme in-

Donaldson that they would comply with any request

made by the Internal Revenue Service.
23

Now, Donaldson, be 1.iev.:ing that th<a! procedures being
used to investigate him ,ere not proper, sou•Jht to prevent the
voluntary compliance by the Acme Circus.
3

Following the

1

guidelines set down by this Court in the Reisman case, Mr.

2

Donaldson petitioned the D:i.str ·.ct Court for a temporary restrai -

3

ing order, enjoining this third pc1rty, Acme c ·.rcus from com-

4 plying with any requests or summonses by the Internal Re'lienue.
The District Court granted the tt:mpo;:ary- restr'lhiing

order and the 'hi.rel P~l.:t ·.

administrative summons that hacl been isnued to the Acme Circus.

The summonses required th3.t Acme and Mercurio furnish informa-

tt

tion concerning their financing dealin,s with the tru:payer.
In the Government's petition they alleged that these

summonses issued by the special agent ~~re to obtain info:!"matio
necessary for a deceniinat.i.cn of Donaldson's correct tax
liability.

Donaldson

t

ns not named a ,:>arty to the su..,1mons

enforcement action and therefore noved to intervene under Rule
24(a) 2 of the Federal Rules cf Civil ?roc::-.dare: intervention

of rights.
Donaldson alleged that he h,id an interest in this
action and he would be bound by the de~ision of this action and
that he was not adequately represented by the existing parties.
He also filed proposed answer..; in which he alleged that the
purpose for which the special agent had isnued the summons was
not, in fact, determination of correcl:tax liability, but rather
to gather evidence for use in a criminal p~osecution.
4

t

Donaldson also alJ.eged thtt•~ Section 7602 of the

2

Internal Revenue Code, t.c s<:atute under which the summons is

3

issued, does not authorize the use of a summons for criminal

4

investigations.

As we have mentioned, r:her

was no cvidentiary

comes before this court on a writ of certiorari to tne ~th

9

The court simply denied .ntervention and the case

We believe th.it the courts below have erred :i.n three

fO

ways: first we believe that under Rule 21(a, of the Federal

11

Rules of Civil Procedure, Donaldson had an '-nterest which uas

12

not adequately represent~d or protected and therefore he should

13

have been allowed tointervene under R\1le 24 (a) 2.

14

Secondly, this Court, in i ;;s decision in Reisman

15

versus caplin, specifically approved taxpayer inter,,,,ntion in

16

third party summons enforce;11ent proce dings, in order ta allow

17

the ta-~payer an opportunity to cha:!--

Section 7602 summons.

Donaldson was also a proper party to th~ PU'orcemen~ proceeding.

This hel' bean -Llluminai:eu to ao.,e extent '-Jy

questions from the ber.ch, bu-.; I belie>'TC it •/OUld be hel?fUl to
make this analytical fral'ficwc k explic.. t.

The court proceedlngs in whic'l the Petitioner seeks
to intP.rvene is, in effect, one that he him·elf created.

There

would have been no !'Ull'Jr.'lns enforcement proceeding in th
District Court and indeed, no judicial proc~cdtng of anJ kind
in which t-J1e Petitic!ler or c.nyone else could seek to in::ervene
had the Petitioner not ~~cure~

fr0,1 th~ Dis :rict Court
l 'l

1

preliminary injunction resisr:iining the witness'.!s summoned by

2

the Incernal Revenue Service from complyinq tfith l~e summons

3

until ordered by a court~ of co1npetr.mt jurisdiction to do so.

4

The :-:-ecord show:; .::hey were willing to comply wi 'cll

5

summon.; ana but for that pre .iI~inary injunction there would

6

have been no occqsion for en orcement proceedings.

7

The Petitioner, in one important sense, underotates

0

the case when he conte1,ds th<1t he is the real party in interest

9

in \:he enforcement procsedin<J.

·rhere simply is no issue in

10

that proceeding other th,:m the question whether a petitioner

11

will be permitted to intervene aJ'ld if oo, whatever issues he

12

will be all01ied to raise.

13

In ot-.her worti1J, the case in s'tlbstance, involves

14

nothing but an attempt by the petitioner to secure judicial

15

interference with the conducting of an Internal Revenu~ Service

16

investigation, an invo1Jtiga~ing relating to his past liabilities

17

but directed in this instance, only to third persons and to

IO

records that are not his and that do not embody any confidential

19

communications, whose Ji~clo~ure he claims he i~ legally

20
21

22
23
24
25

privileged to prevent.
On t.his view of the case it: is difficult to see why
the Petitioner stands on any different footinq from that of any
other person who ,~iehes to prevent or interfe:r:e with an investigation of third persons by govcrru>.iont officials, because
he fears thatthe investigation may eventuate in the bringing of

Q

But you would argue tha': if there was some

objection to these records at the tri2J. that they should be
overruled if the only objection is that they were coercively
sought before any case was filed?
A

I agree with tha.: contention; it should be

overruled if that is the only bas.i.s fer the objection, but I
also say that that is the kind of objec;ion that only someone
with an interest in the records should nave the standing to
make at that stage in :he first place, at the investigative
stage in tha first place.

Mr. Justice Blc1ck, it is not in the record
