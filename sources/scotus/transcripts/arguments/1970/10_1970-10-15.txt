ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. EVANS:

7

8

We shall hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it please

the Court:
This case presents problems which extend from the

9
10

relationship of the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause

11

of the Sixth Amendment.

12

the appellee Evans for murder in connection with the slaying of

13

three police officers in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

The issues arose during the trial of

Evans was convicted primarily by the testimony of one

14
15

Wade Truett, an accomplice who turned state's evidence.

16

was an eye-witness to all the details at the crime.

Truett

17

Q

When did this take place.

1

A

Yes, sir, the murder was on the evening of April

19

17, 1964.

20

October 1965.

21

The trial was approximately over a year later, in

As I was saying, Truett testified as to all material

22

details of the triple slaying.

23

in question and I shant go into it in great detail.

24

do think it might be appropriate to summarize some of the high­

25

lights so as to crux the issues which I will come to discuss in

Truett3s testimony is not. here

However, 1

j

1

the proper factual context»
According to Truett, he, Evans and one Venson Eugene

2
3

Williams had been engaged in a plan and concert of action to

4

steal automobiles.

5

They would first purchase a vehicle which had been wrecked

The basic nature of the crime was as follows:

!
6

beyond the point where it could be commercially repaired.

By

7

this I mean to commercially repair a wrecked vehicle entailing

8

the purchase of spare automotive parts.

i

They would, first, purchase a vehicle that was so

9
10

badly repaired that the purchase of the automotive parts would

11

cost more than they could recover on a subsequent sale of the

12

vehicle.

IS

•

The second step was to steal an identical vehicle.

13
14

That was the first step of their operation.

By doing this they could pirate the required parts from the
stolen vehicle, put them on the wrecked vehicle and sell it at

16

a very substantial profit.

In addition, they could use the

17

spare parts of the stolen vehicle for resale and make a profit

18

on these parts as well.
In pursuing this plan it is important to note the car

19
20

was stolen before, at the time of and after the time of the slay­

21

ing of the three police officers.

The slaying itself grew out

The car in question was an Olds-

It was stolen during the early morning hours of April

Following the ordinary course of operations, they drove

the automobile to a rural location in nearby Gwinnett County,

Now Truefct's testimony was corroborated by an abundance

6

of physical evidence, such as location of the automobile, the

7

location of the pistols which were later found as well as the

8

testimony of various other witnesses.
As 1 stated earlier, none of the testimony which I

9

10

have related to this point is at all in issue in this case.

11

The testimony that is in issue is the testimony given by one

12

of the corroborating witnesses.

13

given by one Lynwood Shaw.

This testimony ik the testimony’

Shaw was a fellow inmate in the Federal Penitentiary

14
15

approximately a year after the crime, at the time Venson Eugene

16

Williams was arraigned in connection with the triple slaying.
.

17

On the day following his arraignment, back in the Federal Peni­

18

tentiary,, his fellow inmate Shaw asked Williams, "How did you make

19

out?"

20

Alex Evans, we wouldn't be in this now."

21

The reply was, "If it hadn't been for that dirty

5

This testimony was objected to by Evans during his

22

trial on the ground it violated both the hearsay and his rights

23

under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.

trial court admitted the evidence on the ground that there had

25

clearly been a shewing of car theft conspiracy and that the

prosecution put that testimony in?

Sir, it is corroborating testimony.

There was

witnesses which were corroborating witnesses.

In fact, it was much weaker corroborating testi-

if you would highlight that again?

Would you ---

In any event, Evans appealed this ruling to the

10

Supreme Court of Georgia ,

12

under the long-standing Georgia rule that the tendency of a

13

conspiracy encompasses the period of fulfillment after the accom­

14

plishment of the unlawful objectives, although I point out here

15

that we show unlawful objectives, but the conspiracy we know

The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed

aspect at all, it is purely on that particular rule?

Evans appealed this case after leaving the Georgia

23

Supreme Court and applied for certiorari to this Court,
Q

24

It was the ruling of the Supreme Court, yes, sir.

May I interrupt you once more and I will let you

step down.

i

I am reading from the dissent»

!

"His testimony was

2

hearsay, and while the admission of hearsay evidence is not

3

always hurtful, in this instance it obviously was prejudicial

4

to the defendant.”

i

t

*
And this is the one dissenter.

Kvhy do you think that the majority of the court did

5

8

not respond to that observation' if they felt it was harmless

7

error?
A

8
9

;

•:

X think — 1 did not say that the Georgia Supreme

Court, I do not believe, considered the harmless error issue,

10

because the Georgia Supreme Court did not consider it error, in 1

11

the first place.

12

so therefore they did not treat it as harmless error because

13

they thought there was no error at all, harmless or otherwise,
Q

14

The majority thought it was properly admitted,j

Well, if they were wrong in-that respect, it

would have been helpful if they could have concluded it was

harmless.

In any event, this Court denied the petition for

In retrospect I would certainly agree.

certiorari.
Unsuccessful in direct appeals, EVaas next turned to

2f

state’s district court where he continued what has become lament-

22

ably an integral part of the- appellate process.

23

he filed his petition for a local, habeas corpus.
The district court-denied the writ.

:

In other words,

It cited Wigmore

to the effect that the evidentiary and the constitutional

does not go to the scope of testimony which can be given by a

witness who is on the stand and available for cross-examination.

took a different view.

sequent decisions in this Court, the Court of Appeals equated

tion clause.
Mow I emphasise this point because the Court of Appeals
did not stop with the customary exceptions — and of course there
are numerous exceptions ~~ to the rule in the beginning.

18
19

20

To the

«•
'
contrary, it said that all exceptions to the rule must be'con­
tinually scrutinized and the rule evaluated by Federal courts.
And, secondly, they said that state exceptions to the

26
17

I should say it equated

the exclusionary aspects of the hearsay rule with the confronta­

11
12

Unlike Wigmore, unlike the district

rule would be permitted only in the light of the facts of the
case.

The admission of the evidence in the case was supported

by "salient and cogent reasons.88
They are of the opinion that the fasts and the circum­

22

stances of this case were not such as to render the admission

22

salient and cogent, because they held that as applied Georgia's

23

statutory exception to the hearsay rule was unconstitutional

24

because- it violated Evans* rights under the confrontation clause

25

In our brief we set forth four reasons why we think

Since I last argued this case, of course this Court

21

decided California v. Green, which we hhink goes a considerable

22

way to upholding our position on this threshold error of the

We hope the Court will reverse the Circuit Court on the

grounds of the threshold error.

However, if the Court should

Now of course this is not incorrect in our view that
the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause differ.

ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N„ GRISWOLD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

MR. GRISWOLD:

8

I need not say that this is a very difficult case.

9

May it please the Court:
j

The facts have been stated by Mr. Evans and I see no reason to

10

devote any more time to them.

11

admissibility of the evidence of Shaw as to the statement which j

12

was made to him by Williams some 15 months after the killings

13

involved here.

14

The issue, of course, is the

\j
As a matter of fact, whan this case was before the

15

Court a year ago — and incidentally, it was argued a year ago*

16

today to the day, on October 15, 1969 -—*

17

Q

At least we are not losing any time.

18

A

It was ’urged on me that I should file a brief

13

amicus curiae and I gave very careful consideration to that

20

suggestion and I didn't just ignore it, I finally decided not toj

21

do it because 1 couldn't make up my mind which side I would be

22

on if I filed -a brief amicus curiae, and X_ f oijnd it not likely

23

to be able to file a brief dubitante.

i
j

I

24
25

Last June the Court requested the Solicitor General
to file a brief.

I was thus put in the position which, of course,
18

1

I am constantly in, that I had to come to a conclusion»

2

the help of associates X i^restled with it and we have come up

3

with the brief which has heifn filed and the arguments which 1

4

shall present, which does come to a conclusion»

5

plain that that is in the minds of all of us in a closed sense

6

a difficult matter.

7

Q

With

But it is quite;

May I ask you a question, Mr. Solicitor General?

8

Am I wrong in thinking that your views are somewhat changed

9

from the amicus brief you filed in the Green case and the one

10

you filed in this case?
A

11

If so, Mr. Justice, I am not aware except to whafcf

12

ever extent we may have learned.

13

by the decision in the Green case, which of course we have tried

14

to utilize.

15

problems — and X perhaps say the outer limits of the problems,

16

the differing views of the problems — are well presented in

17

the Green case by your concurring opinion and Mr, Justice Bren­

18

nan’s dissenting opinion, and the facts here, of course, are

19

somewhat different in that case so that it comes up in a differ-;

20

ent context.

21

I may say, too, that the interest a year ago in filing
...•
I
a brief amicus curiae on behalf of the Department of Justice was;

The law may have been advanced;

I may say that in some ways it seems to me that the

24

spirator exception to the hearsay rule.

19

There was concern that j
..

?

drastically restrict what you might call the basic central use

2
3

of the co-conspirator exception in cases where it is a statement!
l
during a conspiracy and in furtherance of a conspiracy and there;

4

was quite understandable concern within the Department of Justice

5

that that would be a very serious matter»

6

in the Department and I have had in mind the situation that

7

arose in the Bruton case where a case adverse to the Government

S

was reached in a matter as to an issue that was not raised by

9

any party in the case and where the Court did not set --- did not

■

!

And X think that people

«

io

direct the attention of counsel to the question whether della

11

Pioli should be overruled.

12

I have felt chagrined since that time not that the

13

result would have been any different„

14

sideration at the time the Bruton was belong briefed and argued,

IS
IS

17

13

You did give some con­

but we could not then brief the issue of the validity of della
Pioli without submitting it to the Court, which was something
which had not been done by the other side.
And so in the brief which we have filed, we have

19

developed our first argument to the general proposition not dis­

20

positive in this case, but an important part of the background,

2!

that the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule is not only

22

well established in the decisions of this Court, but is valid

23

and is consistent with the confrontation clause.

24
25

How, of course, there has been quite a bit of develop­
ment of thought in this area.

It wasn't until the Point case some
20

1

six years ago that the confrontation clause was found to be

2

directly binding on the states.

a

And in the Pointer case the

4

opinion of Mr. Justice Black,, the confrontation clause and the
\
right to cross-examination are equated. The opinion refers to

5

under this Court’s prior decision the Sixth Amendment guarantee

.

I
j
j

6

of confrontation and cross-examination was unquestionably denied\

7

petitioner in the case.

8
9

i

It is true a little later on there was somewhat regulari;
recognised that there were a few exceptions, but the general

10

treatment was that confrontation means the right to cross-

11

examination.

And our first proposition here would be that

t

12

closely related as they are and designed to achieve a similar

13

end, that confrontation and the right of. cross-examination are

14

not the same things, and I believe that that is shown by passages

15

is subsequent opinions.

16

i

I can't rely on the decision in California against
|

17

Green in respect -to that because the basis of the decision in

18

Green is that there was a right to cross-examine in that case,

19

even though the witness was not willing po saying anything.

20

|
Q

There was an opportunity to cross-examine?
'

21

22

j

A

There was an opportunity for cross-examination for
j
whatever you could get from it and, as was pointed out, the very
f

23

nature of his "nontestimony" on cross-examination had a consider­

24

able bearing on the propriety of his prior statement.

25

Wow it is clear, it seems to me, from this Court’s
21

1

decisions of long standing and which are not, as far as I know,

2

now subject to question, that the right of confrontation does

3

not mean that, there must be the right of cross-examination, that

4

they are not co-equal or co-extensive*

i
The clearest example is the two Mattox cases in the'

S
6

140 and the 150 its.

7

the other was the case of the prior testimony of a witness who

8

is now dead.

‘
In neither case can there be present cross-examina

In both cases the evidence was held to be admissible and

10

we feel that those decisions are not only historically valid,

n

but was currently sound.

12

with what might be called the "best.evidence" rule, if I can use

13

that phrase; here, in that in neither case was the declarant

U

18

19

24.
25

In both cases there was compliance
\

available.

In both of them he is dead and in one of them he

\

i

i
1

was dead shortly after he made the statement, and in the other
he was subjected to cross-examination at the first trial and had
died in the interval.
There are a few other illustration.of exceptions to
the hearsay rule whpre evidence is traditionally, and 1 think I
can almost say "daily," admitted where there is no right of
cross-examination.
The clearest instance of that is the business records
exception, which has been widely established and adopted, and
where many facts are shown,generally speaking facts that are not
really subject to dispute and where, if they are disputed, means

The witness Shaw was subject to cross-examination,

There is no doubt about the propriety of

that it would not be irrational -—

What about?

Q

You said "by the states," that they would -use —-

14

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I would think the same thing

15

would apply to the Federal Government.

Indeed, I would think

16

it was a fortiori as to the 3tates.

17

the business records
exception is the result of a Federal statute
■

But, as I understand it,

18

and it is certainly included in the proposed rules for the

19

district courts, which are under preparation by the committee

20

under the judicial conference.

21

It seems to me to be rational.

It would certainly not

22

be surprising to a Frenchman or a German if a statute were to

23

be enacted either by the Federal Government or by a state which

24

said, in substance, that the hearsay rule is hereby abolished,

23

and all evidence which are heretofore been considered as hearsay|
24

1

shall be admissible, civil or criminal, provided it meets the

2

following test:

3

wow item 1 would be "relevance.”

Item 2 would be

4

"some element of trustworthiness, some basis for believing it

it was true, but there is some basis for believing that there is I

some reason that the jury should be allowed to rely on „

I think with respect to criminal cases we might have

certainly hearsay statements made under compulsion:

I suspect, too, and this would be hard to verbalize or formulate .

that long narrative statements involving a succession of facts

period time could not be used that way consistently with the

Green case, which went beyond the traditional hearsay rule,

Now we come to this particular case where you have the

Georgia statute, which on its face is not very striking, after-

12

of the conspirators during the pendency of the criminal project

13

shall be admissible against all.

14

when looked at simply verbally with the traditional co-conspirator

exception to the hearsay rule.

18

And that is rather consistent

that goes beyond the traditional co-conspiracy exception to the .

Here we have a statement which is ——

24

Q

25

There are some states which have this statutory

rule, are there not, like Colorado, Kansas?
27

!

A

There are two 'or three states which have something

a

like this, I believe.

3

Q

In a criminal exteat.

4

A

It has not been a general — most of the states

5

have limited it to in furtherance of the conspiracy and during

8

the continuance of the conspiracy, although many of the states

7

treat, the conspiracy as continuing as- long as it is to conceal

8

the past events, which has much the same effect.

©

It is clear to ns that this statement would not have

10

been admissible in a-trial in a .Federal court.

11

because it violated the conspiracy — it violated the confronta­

12

tion clause of the Constitution, but because it is not within any

1.3

now-existing Federal rule of evidence with respect to the .admissi

14

bility of such statement.

15

We think not

Now the question whether it.should be admissible in a

i

16

state trial involves not merely the laws of evidence and law

17

of the Constitution, but also a special aspect of the law of the'

18

Constitution and that this is a Federal system.

19

sirability, as we view it, iss this Court establishing a fixed

20

and rigid pattern with respect to the law of evidence to which

21

every state must adhere and which would prevent further deverlop- ’

22

menfc and experimentation in this area.

I
And the unde-

i
I

23

And we, having examined this evidence in this case,

24

as thoroughly and closely as we can, find it difficult to see

25

how it could properly have been admitted in the Georgia case for

28

1

the reasons stated by the Georgia Supreme Court.

2

the construction of the statute given by the Georgia court, which

3

of course is binding upon this Court, as to the meaning of that |

4

statuta, that this comes within an exception to the hearsay rule;

5

with respect to co-conspirators, both because the time delay of ;

the situation like the one of the witness Perry, who, in effect,!

confronted Evans with some suggestion, and the testimony was that

Evans threatened him if he ware to reveal it?

kind of factual setting which could be regarded as in furtherance

12

of concealment of conspiracy?
A

13

Would that be the

Mow, Mr. Justice, that of course was Evans who

14

did that.

You don't have somebodv else.

In this case it is

15

Williams' statement, and Perry's testimony is with respect to

IS

facts that Perry saw and observed.

17

it was his words, but that could be of the order of confession

18

or admission.

Evans said, of course some of

All I

How it is quite clear that the Georgia Supreme Codrt
did not decide anything a's to the law of Georgia with re.spect
to these indicia of trustworthiness.

Georgia might not find tha :

17

that was consistent with its law and I.don-’t think that this

18

Court should make that kind of a lax? for Georgia, and so we would

19

suggest that in the inevitable remand of this case, because no

2©

matter what the Court does there are other issues, that the ques­

21

tion should be left open for the Supreme Court of Georgici to hold

22

that under its law evidence of this sort is admissible because

23

it does contain the earmarks of trustworthiness which are within

24
25

the ambit of the extensions of the hearsay rule, of which the
state court and legislature can make.
32

1

One of the factors which mews us to this conclusion

is the great undesirability of having the Federal court sit in

review of every interstitial decision in state criminal trials„

Turning again to the premises on which you are

arguing, what would the Georgia court do on the man that it

The Georgia court would, as- I see it, say that

evidence be presented?

Why can a book entry or a business entry be presented?

the confrontation and the right to cross-examination are not

them limited, and in all of which I think there is some earmark '

Why can't a dying declaration be presented?
Because

Now obviously it can't be admitted if it violates the j

confrontation clauses, therefore my answer to your question was

that it didn’t violate the confrontation clause.

Do you consider whether or not the confrontation

Well, when I said that the decision with respect

to co-conspirators was right, I meant the reasoning with respect

20

to co-conspirators.

21

of the district court is the judgment — the judgment is that

22

the judgment of the district court is reversed, and 1 think that

23

that at least was put on the wrong ground.

There was another issue involved that is

Williams, we understand, was commuted under Witherspoon

22

to the life imprisonment.

However, the Supreme Court of-Georgia

23

has followed a different course from that? although there is no

24

statutory law that contemplates a bifurcated trial, the Supreme

25

Court of Georgia where Witherspoon has been raised and was

applicable has remanded the case fco the trial court for a sole

issue of trial punishment.

the jury that convicted him, that verdict stands and a new jury

this.

This would be the option, of course, of the

district attorney as to what the evidence would be on the issue

23

of penalty.

do have such a second trial now that has been recently enacted.

is based almost solely upon the testimony of Wade Truett g who

wanted to point out that the evidence was not so overwhelming

as to events, time and place.

There was only one slight bit of .
I

20

evidence that would connect Evans with this offense, and that

21

was the testimony referred to a moment ago of M. C. Perry.

22

had talked to Evans on one occasion or more and had talked to

23

Williams on other occasions concerning the theft of the automo­

24

bile.

23

He

This, we would say, would tend to corroborate Truett's
46

I
j

I

testimony.

2

The only other corroboration or suggested corroboration

3

in the record of Truett’s testimony given under the circumstanced

4

as we outlined was this statement of Lynwood Shaw, the statement!

S

that is here in question.

6

as the state did at the time of the trial in its argument to the

7

jury, it meant that Evans did participate in the crime.
We approach those facts now in context with what hap­

3

9
•

10

Cryptic as it is, we suggest that

pened.

First of all, Shaw had. testified two weeks previously at-

WilliamsJ trial and Williams had been convicted.

At that trial

—0

11

he had testified differently than he had testified to here, as

12

is shown on page 51 of the appendix.

.13

He testified actually at

that trial:. '"If it had not been for that dirty S.O.B. Alex

14

Evans shooting Everett" — that was one of the officers — "we

13

wouldn't be in this mess."

16

At the trial we did not go into that and cross-examine

17

concerning this statement, because it would have been more hurt­

18

ful to citiaen than helpful to a jury.
But in any event, knowing that Mr. Shaw would testify

19
20

to something in this substance, the objection to the evidence

21

here was made prior to the time it was introduced, and it was

22

made on .the constitutional ground, on hearsay grounds and on other

23

grounds.

24

the question a moment ago, why did the state introduce the evi­

25

dence — the state fought strenuously the motion to exclude it.

The state nevertheless — and Mr. Justice Black asked I

47

1

And the record takes a good postion of the argument of counsel

2

in ruling the court in this connection,

a

Despite the raising of the issue, somewhat prematurely,,

4

but it is protective of the defendant on trial,- the state still

5

insisted that it be admitted into evidence.

Thereafter Shaw was

6 | subjected to rather strenuous cross-examination, not on the
7 ! question of what Williams said, but on his own ~ attempting to

8

test his own veracity.

9

We submit that that very thing that happened here in

10

perhaps a different context, well perhaps different statements

11

and in different courts of the same things that have happened in
i

12 ! 'the four cases previously decided by this Court, in which the

this case.

He refused to testify on the ground that it might

of asking him questions, read the statement to the jury that the;

co-defendant had previously mads, implicating the defendant on

13

trial*

16

who had taken the statement, to corroborate or to establish the
fact that it was the statement made by the co-defendant.

'
We submit again that the facts are not dissimilar from

who testified that he had made the statement*

reasoning of that case.

We submit that the application of a rule of law which

14
15

would make any statement made by a co-conspirator, whether it be

17

would have the same effect that this Court has railed impermissi­

20

an actual witness testify through the mouth of,someone# the

21

witness’ veracity being untested and untestable and not subject

to cross-examination.
Wow I am not overly concerned with attempting to draw

24

some line between the right of confrontation and the right of

25

cross-examination.

It seems to me from the exceptions that have

56

i

stated to the Court, and those which we know, the right of con-

frentation is also denied where the right of cross-examination
