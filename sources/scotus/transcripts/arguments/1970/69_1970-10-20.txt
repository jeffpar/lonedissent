ARGUMENT OF BRENDA SOLOFF, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

1

MISS SOLOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court, at issue in this case is the ability of the aaency

9

which is charged with administering a local aid to families

10

with dependent children program to verify information which an

!1

applicant or recipient is concededly obliged to furnish for

12

eligibility purposes, and to verify it as meaningfully as

13

possible by a visit to the home by an agency caseworker; or,

14

put another way, the question is whether the adult AF'DC client

15

has an absolute right to refuse access to her home and still

16

receive assistance, no matter what her conceded obligations

17

may be and even if her refusal is entirely arbitrary.
Essentially we submit that since AFDC assistance is

18
19

premised on the care of children in homes which would other­

20

wise be unable to provide for them, that the request for

21

access to the home is a reasonable one.

22

that request was denied, the result is neither entry no-'

23

contempt proceedings nor automatic termination of benefits, but

24

a hearing.

25

In addition, since

The home visit apparatus does not infringe any
2
i

1

Fourth Amendment right.

2

validate the home visit, nor could any such procedure more full],

3

protect the AFDC client against the arbitrary exercise of

4

authority than the one that we have now.

the form of additional home visits to attempts to verify

5

eligibility and to attempt to deal with appellessee's many de­

6

mands, the greater number of which would seem to be invalid.

7

These contacts toot

During these visits no worker went behind closed

8

doors or poked or pried Into any closed area and at each visit

9

the child was seen.

10

Ultimately she notified a caseworker who had sought

11

to make an appointment by letter a week in advance that under

12

no circumstances and at no time would the worker be admitted

13

to the home.

14

On May 27, 1969, before any termination of benefits,

15

a hearing was held by the department at which appelleee and

16

counsel ware present,and counsel represented that althouqh his

M

client would talk anywhere, she would not talk at home, because

18

that would violate her right of privacy.

19

The referee found that refusal to comply with the

20

policy of contact by home visit justified the closing of the

21

case, pointing out -- and I quote from his opinion --

22

hone visit which Mrs. James refuses to permit is for the pur--\

23

pose of determining if there are changes in her situation that!

24

might affect her eligibility to continue to receive public

25

assistance or that might affect the amount of such assistance/

Appellee did not proceed, as she could have, to a state fair

3

hearing.

S

for the Southern District of Hew York, seeking declaratory and

7

injunctive relief against the termination of benefits for re­

8

fusal to consent to a home visit without a warrant.

9

Instead, a complaint was filed in the District Court

A statutory three-judge court was convened and in

10

its majority opinion the court held that a home visit without

11

a warrant is an invasion of the constitutionally protected

12

right cf privacy, that alternative methods are available to

13

verify eligibility, and that should a home visit be deemed re­

14

quired to consider a certain aspect of eligibility, and the

15

applicant o.r-recipient refuses to allow the visit, a suitably

16

•* ■
restrictive search warrant may issue to force the client to

17

disclose the terms of his eligibility.

18

jI

The majority rejected any idea that the home visit
,

19

could legitimately ascertain the well-being of the child, al-

20

though I think somewhat inconsistently it also provided in its

21

alternative possibilities for verification of the %ve31-being

22

of the chile.

23

The first point to be made, I think, is that the

24

home visit as presently structured is a reasonable and neces­

25

sary investigative tool in. AFDC eases.

There is ~~ if you mean, Mr. Justice, is there

n

a regulation specifically requiring home visits, there is only

12

for a quality controlled sample of cases, but there is such a

13

requirement for investigation of a selected sample;

14

think it is .important to note in this context that the

15

appellees apparently don't challenge the fact that you can

16

make home visits to this selected sample.

And I

17

Q

What is the selected sample?

18

A

It is not that 1 know of specifically desig­

19

nated in the regulations, but each householder is a potential

20

member of that sample, and it seems to me that constitution­

21

ality doesn't rest on the number of homes that you include in

is the idea that under that regulation the

4

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

5

Q

Well, sample, tell us something more about

6

that.

How do you select the houses to be in the sample?

7

A

I ara not completely familiar with the mechanics

8

of how these samples are selected, but I do know that each

9

state is required to furnish a sample that will be adequate at

10

least for HEW purposes, will be deemed to be adequate to deter­

iI

mine if in fact eligibility requirements are being met.

12
13

Q

Well, is there any significance that HEW -- in
'
<
the fact that apparently KEW requires only visits to a sample
i

14

15

of places and not to all of those sharing in the program?
'
A
I think there is no constitutional significance

16

to it, Mr. Justice, as far as whether or not there is -- these

17

are significant in the fact that they deem this adequate --

this is a policy question, it may or may not.

problems which the state is trying to cope with in this

fashion, and nothing in HEW regulations proscribe this.

Q

I

Unless you are to read a proscription beyond

the sample in the fact that that is all HEW requires.
A

can't do any more.

I am more familiar with what

in that case, each state was required to set up
;

21

entire state, to try to see if eligibility could be deterI

22
23

mined on a simple affidavit process.
To check that, a home visit was required, as pa’-t of

24

a full field investigation, again in a selected sample of

25

cases, and the results that have come in from that so far are
8

inconclusive.
Q

Now is the investigation including the home,

is it aimed only at a surveillance to determine eligibility
or continued eligibility?
A

Its eligibility and continued eligibility in

the full sense, that is that the person is in need and that
with respect to continued eligibility that the assistance
which is being given works for the benefit of the child.

And

if it doesn't work, then that is an aspect of eligibility for
the program.
Q

How is

is that a condition for eligibility,

that it works?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

heme visit contributes to the determining of eligibility based
on those few factors that determine e3igibiIIty, not from
peripheral matters that you might be able co

Q

Whafc has that got to do with eligibility?

A

It has to do with the possibility of resources, i

This is in terms of the initial eligibility, I am speaking of
!

9

1

now, has to do with the possibility of the existence of undis­

2

closed resources.

C?

Q

How does a home visit contribute to that?

4

A

By seeing what is in the home, the worker may

5

be able to have an idea of whether or not the conditions

6

which the client has stated exist do in fact exist, and in

7

terms of the functioning of the household in relation to the

8

child, the borne visit can tell more than an office visit.
Q

Now, that is what 1 don't understand.

If

is that it?

12

A

That's right, Mr. Justice.

1.3

Q

How do you tell that?

14

A

You can tell by the functioning, the relation­

■

15

ship of the child to the home, whether there are adequate

16

facilities for the child in the home, whether the child is

17

receiving the kind of care which doss now or may create a

18

dangerous situation which must --

Doesn't that terminate

Under the
Or does it just provide some grounds for taking

some action under some other law?
l

A

Well, it is the ground, the ultimate result is j
10

a neglect proceeding, which the statute specifically provides,
the Federal Social Security Act provides must be done if there
is a danger to the child, that would in effect terminate
eligibility.

It may be that services will have to be

mandatory services will have to be provided for the child to
keep the child in a home.
Q

Well, lefcJs see, does that mean,

for example,

that if an investigation disclosed that the mother with a
single child is an alcoholic and all the money she gets noes
into the purchase of liquor, and none of it goes to buy food
/for the child or something like that.

That then means

eligibility may be terminated and so the child gets nothing?
A

Wo, Mr. Justice, it means that steps must be

taken to protect the child, even if it means either introduc­
ing another person into the home to care for the child or
removing the child from the home.

This is the purpose of the

program, is a statutory congressional policy that not only
the technical criteria of eligibility but the home conditions
of the child are relevant to maintaining the child in that
program.

If the child cannot be maintained in the borne, then

he must either be removed or steps taken to improve the home,
but that is as important an aspect of the program as the
other.

We are aiming at the child and seeing the borne in this

respect is as important as the technical eligibility factors.
In my reply brief in this Court, I cited two
11

j instances which x think i'llustrates — one illustrates one of
these factors and the other illustrates the other.

The first

one referred to was an example from the selected sample in the
declaration system,

and it was a woman who had applied for

assistance and been accepted for assistance on the grbunds
that her husband had deserted her, and assistance was given.
However, a spot check was made and the worker discovered the
husband in the home.

It was quite as simple as that.

And the

result of that was a support hearing, a payment of rent arrears,
i

a reference to a marriage counselor, but an ineligible family
was not put on the •-'oils, and that was a purely tehnieal
eligibility factor.
The other case was far more drastic in what hap­
pened and far less precise in what the worker could determine.
This was a recertification visit, under New York Law in nonexperimental area, under the present system,

and the worker

walked into the home, and we.knew that the family consisted of
a mother and three children -- and she walked into the home
and she saw the mother and the oldest child and not the other
two children,

and the home atmosphere quite simply disturbed

her .
She was told that one child was with his maternal
grandparent and that the other child was with same neighbor,
but that she wasn’t sure which, and that, is all she did, but
she was disturbed and she went back to the center and she
12

I

1

told the maternal grandparents and they had not

they did not |

2

have the infant and they were not aware of where the infant was.
'

3

The maternal grandparents -- who apparently were more aware of

4

the disturbed nature of the mother than even the center —* went

5

immediately to the home and it was discovered that the younger

6

two children in fact were dead, and the oldest child was

7

brought in to the center.

j

But there was no precise element in that home on

8

which you could get a warrant on which you could base any

|

10

kind of determination, and yet it was the responsibility of the j

II

agency which must provide for care of children in the home

12

only so long as they can be cared for in the home, to find out

13

what happened to those children, and chat was the -way they did

14

it.

15

Q

Could I ask you a question at this point?

What

'16

are the administrative steps that must be gone through before a

17

caseworker can go in and make an inspection?

18

A

The recert specs are established by regulation,

1

Mr. Justice, a visit must be made -- well, a contact is sup-

20

posed to be made in every AFDC case every three months.

21

had been the policy to make the visit every three months and

22

this would be on a regular schedule devised by the center it-

j

This

I
{

23

self which was sending out the caseworkers.

24

made every three months impossible in New York City,

25

has been reduced to every si:x months at this point.
13

Caseloads have
and it

5

Q

Then the casework in the interval between the

,

2

scheduled visit, the case when he gets an idea that he or she

:
i

would just like to go in and just take a look at the house,
4

s

more than the regulations prescribe, can they do that?
A

They have no authority to make a '-ecertifica-

6

fcion visit for that purpose.

I think that eligibility itself,

7

technical eligibility is only in those set slot periods.

8

there may be instances, as in Mrs. James case, where home

9

visits were made at other than recerfcification times.

Mow

But in

10

those instances it was basically to verify information at the

11

request of the client^ certainly at the request of the client

12

it can be made.

A

13

Q

What do you have to say about thei^ suggestions?

19

A

1 think that the suggestions for the warrant

20

the district court made, which are no other alternative avail-

21

able limited to a specific

22

to find out about until you make the home visit,

23

ticularly true with pre-school children, to whom there is

I

It is
{

23

simply unworkable and it would require on an individualised

!

case basis, you have to set up the Kind of body of case law

2

that we have now for criminal Fourth Amendment cases.

<3

I think one of the crucial distinctions between the j

{

4

Camara decision of this court and the reliance placed on it by

5

the district court is just this distinction, because what the

6

district court does in mandating a warrant procedure is to re­

7

structure the home visit to make it no longer reasonable to

8

make it on a periodic basis,

9

related so closely to valid purposes that it clearly is reason­

10

and yet it clearly is,

I

and it is

able.

would also --

Q

A

He is looking for evidence of eligibility and

There is no --

the well-being of the children.

11

12

isn't it?

Q

Which means anything.

It means whatever he can establish from what hei

of the apartment,

Q

the relationship of the people --

Well,

of course, if the average warrant limits

16

where you search and what you search for, but this is broader

17

than a search warrant,

18

A

isnet it?

The average warrant would authorise greater

19

entries and into more areas than, the worker --- there is no

20

charge in any of these -- either by this appellee or by any of

21

the other people who submitted affidavits that that is their

22

problem in this case.

23

of abuse by a caseworker.

24
25

None of them have ever charged that kind;

I would like briefly to say that, as I have said,
the warrant procedure really would restructure the home visit

17

j

i

and that it is reasonable as it stands.

But the reason — if

2

the home visit is to be allowed as it presently stands* then

o'*

the warrant would serve no useful purpose.

that Mrs. James' assistance was terminated because of her re­

You don't have another case in which -- at least

assistance has been terminated solely for refusal to permit --

13

Q

Well, I thought what Mr. Weiss said was that

14

the termination hearing amounts to nothing more than an inquiry,

was a refusal, and if it was found there was a refusal, then

16

automatically an order is entered terminationg benefits.

say that is not so, Miss Soloff?

A

You

I say that you have no other case but this one,

Mr. Justice, and what happened in this case was that reason was

advanced why the visits should not be made, and so that the
