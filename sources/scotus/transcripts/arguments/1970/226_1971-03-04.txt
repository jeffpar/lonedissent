Counsel yesterday referred to the city charter of

San Jose, but no park can be disposed of without a mandatory

Now,, there has been some contest in the briefs

about that but what happens is that in order to get a low-

for 40 years and commit itself to provide all municipal ser­

vices and the calculations have been that the contribution of

the basis that a housing authority is not a city or county.

11

And the constitution was cast in terms of a city or county.

12

Well, this is another example where the words of

13

the 1379 constitution have been eluded by new and ingenious

14

devices.

15

they thought: We at least have a petition referendum that will

17

But the people of California were in trout la because

And then in 1350 the Supreme Court of California said:

the housing authorities now are ashamed of.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

25

24

Thank you, Mr. Lasky.

MR. COX:

1

The precise question in these cases, as I

2

understand it, is whether the state may require local govern­

3

ment action which provides public housing for the poor, for

4

persons of low income»

5

Q

Who are the poor?

S

A

Under the standards in the Federal statute

7

one can take roughly the $4,000 level of income as eligible

3

fcr low-income housing»

9

forth in the statute»

There are five standards that are set
The question is whether the state — or

10

whether if the state may require local government action pro­

11

viding low-rent housing for the poor to run the gauntlet of an

12

automatic referendum not required in the case of governmental

13

action, in behalf of any other group in the conraunity .
And we think because of the fact that this is hous­

14
15

ing for the benefit of persons of low income that Article XXXIV

16

was limited to that group; that this is a situation where one
combines a disposition of the processes of government with an

17

invidious classification, which distinguishes a great many

other cases»

Court, Mr, Justice Ilarlan, has referred to property classifica­

2

tions, classifications of wealth in Cramer, in Cipriano, in

3

the Phoenix case and others, as classifications that are sus­

4

pect and in some cases have drawn that kind of line,
Q

5

May I ask, Mr. Cox: do I correctly understand

6

that what you are attacking is not that there is a referendum,

7

but that California has said that the referendum in this in­

3

stance must be mandatory whereas, as in other subject matter

9

it permits a petition.
A

10
n

Precisely.

That is the relationship is just

the same as in other matters.
Q

12

But I suppose then, if this particular subjeci

13

matter were subject to a petition referendum that no other

14

subject matter is subject to any referendum?
A

15

Then we would be making this same argument.

16

As you suggested earlier, if this provided that there must be

17

votes by five successive boards of supervisors we would be

13

making the same thing.
Q

19

But, since California does have a petition

20

r€:ferendum for a lot of subjects? if this also were subject only

2.1

to a petition referendum then you would not be here.
A

22

Then I could not make the argument that I am

23

making now, and the Chief Justice stated it very precisely

24

earlier.

25

make the same argument I am making today.

I'm saying there could be no argument,; I could not

29

t

Q

You might be here, but on different grounds.

2

A

It would have to be on different grounds.

3

That is correct.

4
5

Q

Would you care to suggest what that might be,

A

Yes.

just —

6

I think it would be — but we would

7

probably take it to the Supreme Court of California, and we

8

would rely chiefly on an opinion that I should refer to on this

9

case in the San Francisco Unified School District against

10

Johnson in 92 California __ ___„,309.
I refer to that case -- it doesn’t deal with Article

1!

12

XXXIV; I don’t want to mislead you, but it does indicate that

13

the Supreme Court of California might well invalidate Article

14

XXXIV on the grounds that it permits and even invites people to

15

vote against low-cost housing on racial grounds.

16

California Court says that inviting people to vote in referenda

17

— or to take action generally — it was there speaking of

18

parents refusing to allow their children to be assigned outside

19

a neighborhood school —
Q

20
21

24
25

Are you suggesting there are unresolved issues

of California constitutional law in this case?
A

22

23

And that the

No, no; simply there is Federal constitutional

There is no question of California constitutional law

2

So the California decision was an Equal

probably be the primary ground of attack here.

Let me elabor­

6

ate at a little more length the matter of the mandatory refer­

10

course, is the occasional provision in the city charter which

deals with the disposition of park property.

There is certainly

He speaks of burdens on the general taxpayer.

13

only exception he refers to is the provision of the California

15

constitution which requires a referendum when an issue of bonds

And we point out, as I suggested yesterday;

13

many

19

instances where land is taken off the tax rolls and there may

20

be soma increased demand for municipal services which does not

21

require a referendum in California — incidentally, Justice

22

Harlan, I believe that that case involving the California bond
issue and the requirement of a two-thirds vote, is presently

23

before the Court in Westbsjook and Mihaly.

24

I don't know whether

it has been argued yet, but the matter is here.

25

Then, the third category that he refers to is
changes in. the boundaries or constitution of local govco t-Bent.
There is nothing in common between this case and that.

This

case has the characteristics that I referred to before? the
built-in disadvantage, the invidious classification and the
inability to explain it by any neutral principle.
I would like —*
Q

I was going to ask you a question, Mr. Cox.

What would you have said about a California statute that said
all social welfare legislation had to be submitted to a two
thirds vote by the legislature?
A

Weil, I would wish to know what social wel­

fare legislation meant, Mr. Justice Harlan.
Q

Well, I am using it deliberately because it

seems to me the term is more apt to your classification of poor
than it is to what I have always understood the Equal Protec­
tion classification of poor meant.

Right.

And again, of course, our case would

What is the difference between mandatory and

a petition?

7

A

Oh, the difference is —

3

Q

For these purposes.

9

A

The differences are three.

One is that those

10

who oppose this step must go out and get the five or eight

It

percent of the votes and have the burden of carrying it.
A second difference, which may be somewhat formal,

12
13

but which I think has psychological significance: under a

14

mandatory referendum you can’t do anything until an affirmative

15

vote has been held; whereas

16

effect says: shall we overturn what our local authorities have

17

done?
And then the third point, as I suggested yesterday:

13
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

in the petition referendum, in

the mandatory referendum under Article XXXIV works only one
we.y.

Now, there are other kinds of housing --Q

Well, the State of California might, I would

assume, might provide the petition referendum to be initiated
by the signatures of 100 registered voters and that would be
almost a formality; wouldn’t it?
A

Well, if it was cut down to that small number
35

1

then there might be a different case# but I suggest that five

2

to eight percent is not a mere formality.

3

set Hunter and Erickson as authorities for that proposition.

Again# of course# I

I think those who try to get five to eight percent

4

5

of the voters on a signature would agree that it is not just a

6

formality.
Now# to go a little further on the matter of housing

7
8

not only is it a matter of transferring the sites at less than

3

cost under urban renewal# but there are occasions 'when the

30

construction itself is subsidized by FHA conventions which re­

11

duce the interest that the real estate developer has to pay

12

because the FHA pays the difference between what he can pay in

13

the way of interest from the rest and what a mortgagee would

14

require.

15

cases.

And sometimes there are rent supplements paid in such

If the sponsor is a nonprofit institution and there

IS
17

are projects being developed this way# then the interest rate

18

is lower.

19

aid, in that the Federal Government takes the mortgage when

20

no one else will.

And often there is# what in fact is an important

21

Now# I am talking about things that the California

22

municipalities are involved in because of urban renewal land.

23

And in these cases I really don't see any relevant difference

24

between the middle income housing projects and the low-rant

25

projects at which Article XXXIV is aimed.
36

Both are housing;

1

both have at least some attributes of government projects and

2

both are publicly subsidised and I have not yet heard anyone

3

suggest why the difference in where the title resolved publicly
/'

4

should justify a difference in their treatment from local

5

government.

8
7

8
9

Q

Doss middle-income housing involve a waiver

of all taxes?
A

No; there is that difference^ butpoint out

again the very large number of instances in which land is taken

10

off the tax rolls by public or private action and California

11

doesn't require an automatic referendum there.

12

The second point that I would emphasise simply by

13

way of recalling it, is as I pointed out yesterdays other

14

government actions having all the characteristics of low-rent

15

housing, except the involvement of the poor, is not required to

16

go to an automatic referendum in California.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

In other words, ho"matter what comparison you make
other groups are treated the same.
Q

What are the sort of things that the three-

judge court talked about?
A

Yes, but not just Federal; also state.

Yes.

Q

But, well, if you want to say that they are

comparative, but there is no other kind of housing that's sub­
ject to legislation is there in California?
A

I just described the closest —
37

1

Q

Urban renewal is the closest?

2

A

Yes.

But then I think this --- a further

3

point, Mr. Justice Stewart ■— I think the Appellant’s argument

4

and our inability to point to some exact -comparisons where the

5

only difference is the involvement of the poor, is that that

S

difficulty is brought out by Hunter and Erickson.

7

Merely to claim that we can't show that discrimina­

8

tion against the poor results from Article XXXIV because we

9

can't show any high-income housing owned by the government just

10

like this is sort of a pale copy of the argument; that the

11

Akron Charter Amendment was nondiscriminatory because whites as

12

well as Blacks and protestants as well as catholics who were

13

seeking fair housing legislation had to go to the referendum.

14

15
16

But here, as there, the reality is that the lav/'s
impact falls on the minority.
Q

Mr. Cox, would you have the same argument if

17

California had simply said: all changes in voting laws must be

18

submitted to an automatic referendum.

19

of laws that submitted the automatic referendum.

20

else is by —

That's the only category
Everything

Then if a public housing project --- we would,

Q

Then the property owner comes along and says:

this is a classification strictly on property owners; it's no
different than a poor classification and it's just as invidious

as you were arguing about a couple of years ago in the Poor

case.

I think property development and zoning laws

affecting property development do much less -Q

9

You can't have s classification based on non/

10

property owners?
A

11

Well, I wouldn’t say that there never could

12

be any classification based on nonproperty owners.

I would

13

want to know in what context ,it arose and also what subject it

14

related to.

15

Q

WEll, this context —

16

A

Well, in this context I feel that it is a

17

discriminatory classification.
Q

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

If this case involved both a law subjecting

zoning laws to the automatic referendum and the subject matter
that's here now, you would sustain the one and strike down the
other?

If this case had both issues in it.

The provision,

the California constitutional provision subjected to the
auto:matic referendum — low referendum

low-rent housing and

all changes in zoning laws.
A

I would think, that one could be sustained and
39

1

nonv/hites

well, 32 percent of fchenonwhifce are poor? and

2

only 12 percent of the general population is nonwhite.
In Santa Clara one finds,, looking not at the Black

3
4

population, but at the Mexican-Americans, that 15.2 percent of

5

all households have anincome below $4,000 but 25.8 percent of

6

the Mexican-Americans have income below $4,000.

?

And, as the opinion below points out — I won’t stop

8

to read it — in the footnote, it's the minorities who have the

9

intense need for housing.

Indeed, the President's Commission

to

on Rousing

n

minorities is three times as intense.

12

form the great block of the people who are the occupants of

13

low-rent public housing.

14

pointed out that the need for housing among
Minorities,, of course,

And when people vote on these questions, as the

15

affidavits in the record make clear: there is not much doubt

16

that what is on the agenda is the unwise poor, the minorities

17

whose housing is more notably inadequate than everyone else's.

18

13
20
21

22
23
24
25

Thera are two other consequences which I can't say
are written into the statute and which I don’t make our case
turn exclusively on with other points, but I think they are
important consequences in deciding whether this is an invidious
classification.

They go very closely together.

The great problem in housing, the great problems
that result from it, come from the difficulties that persons of
low income have in moving to communities where the better jobs
41

1

are? where there is opportunity for self-help and advancement.

E

Mxtil I suppose that two no better examples anywhere in the

3

country, in San Mateo County, is one 'that goes down on the

4

peninsula in California, and San Jose down at the end of the

S

bay.

6

who move info those areas.

7

restraint — I don’t liken it to Shapiro and Thompson — there

8

is an indirect restraint on freedom of movement to go and help

8

themselves and there is also, of course, a resulting built-in

10

preservation of the ghetto because this kind of obstacle makes

II

it difficult to build the necessary public housing units in

12

counties like Santa Clara and San Mateo and that, too, results

13

in racial discrimination.

And the problem is that there is no housing for people

It seems to me, as I say, that in deciding whether

14
'15

So that here there is an indirect

this is an invidious classification, the distinction against

16

persons of low income who can’t afford decent housing, that

17

these consequences are properly taken ,into account.
But the heart of my case rests on the combination,

18

19

as I have said too many times, I am afraid, of the built-in

20

disadvantage not required on any other kind of interest of any

21

other group? the express classification of persons of low

22

income.

23
24
25

And the other absence of any neutral principle which

California can be said to have followed in setting up the
classes of those required to go to an automatic referendum.
Taking those together, Mr. Chief Justice, we submit
42

that there is a denial of the equal protection of the law.

1

Q

2

Let me a.sk you just one more question on

3

this category of -the minorities or the — relating to your

4

classification of the poor for purposes of this case.
Suppose a given county in California, a small county ,

5
6

had a bond issue up for $ 0 or $30 million to construct high

7

schools and it was subject to a referendum, which I gather

8

many of them are? would there be an, equal protection clause or
discrimination factor involved because the principal bene­
ficiaries, the students, couldnf|t vote on the bond issue?

0

A

Well, I would —- because the students

13

Q

The students wouldn't vote.

4

A

Well, I guess you took care of that in —

15

Q

I6m talking about high schools now; 14 to

13
couldn* t?

3

18 as deliberately putting it under the 18 group because lately

16

we —

17

A

8

I think that the character of the bond issue

provisions is one which is a general one, relating to all bond

1®

issues, is one that cuts against one group today and the other

0

grouptomorrow and therefore one can say that this category is

1

set up according to a funiform ru e that, doesn't point the
finger at any group in the community? .that says; "While they

3

t

iire incurring long-term debt," the kind of thing, of course,

4

which in the history of the country frequently resulted in'

5

43
!

1

the insolvency of the cities and counties.

2

about long-term debt we want to go more slowly so we will set

3

up a separate governmental manner of dealing with that group

4

of issues, but that doesn't seem to involve any invidious

S

classification»

6

When we are talking

We do have the question here whether two-thirds

7

should be required.

The Supreme Court of California held that

8

two-thirds could not constitutionally be required.

9

we are not — I am just recalling that for the Court's benefit

Of course

10

— we’re not involved in that and I'm certainly not arguing

It

the merits of that question.
