ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

please the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The sole question presented in this case

10

is whether operational negligence occurring at the time of

tl

the'injury renders a vessel instantaneously unseaworthy.

12

is devoid of any problems of defective equipment, unseaworthi­

13

ness of any other part of the vessel whatsoever.

14

13

owner was denied by the trial court on the basis of Mascuilli.

j

.

IS

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the

17

operational negligence, as presented in the case, did not in'

18

stanfaneously make the ship unseaworthy and in effect refused

19

to fellow the court's decision in Mascuilli,.

20

How, Mascuilli, the facts there are on all fours

21

with the facts here.

The facts in Usner was that the ship

22

was seaworthy, the equipment was, it was the operational

23

negligence of an operator, a longshoreman, of a winch that

24

caused the sling to come down too fast into the barge and

25

striking "the petitioner and injuring him.

1

The equipment was used before and after this occur­

2

rence without any trouble whatsoever, and the same thing is

O

true with the facts as established from the record in Mascuill:'

4

because the trial court in that case found in the Findings of

5

Fact No. 35 that the operational negligence of the winch

And it was done so instantaneously

that the officer had no opportunity t© give a warning.
So the eases are on all fours and we submit that

12

Mascuill! is the posture of the issue here and answers the

13

question very clearly to us that operational negligence occur­

unseaworthy.

has enunciated over the years.

-Unseaworthiness can be caused

by no negligence at all. structural defects.

Unseaworthiness

can be caused by a non-negligent act, as Mr. Justice Black,

9

in Waldron, where the jury found that the order given by the
mate to move the rope by two instead of three or four seamen

11

was not negligent and yet this case held that the question of

IE

unseaworthiness should fee submitted to the jury even though

13

the jury had found that that act itself was not negligent.

14

Uraseaworthiness can be caused by negligent acts.,

15

and unseaworthiness can be caused by negligent acts which

16

occur at the same time and make the ship instantaneously un-

17

seaworfchy.

Mow.

this Court has never, never required that

19

there be a showing that a time must elapse from the negligent

20

act until the, occurrence of the unseaworthiness.

21

has never done that.

22

act of the seamen in choosing the rotten rope instead of the

23

good rope created unseaworthiness.

class are doing now work that was traditionally done before

that work has become more dangerous, using

to this Court extending the maritime law to these types of

workers.

against the stevedore, you lay down various lines there that

14

that this duty of warranty of furnishing a ship reasonably

17

down through the years, and we can see nothing insofar as

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER — RESUMED
ME, BRUMFIELDs

7

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it

please the Court.

As we were stating prior to lunch, this

Court has rendered many landmark decisions in «©<»called

10

cryptic times of- just a few words, and one case that comes

II

to mind is the Peterson ease, where Your Honors held that a

ia

snatch block was brought ashore by stevedoring company,

13

•owned by the shipowner* the shipowner had no knowledge off it,

14

it was defective* and held that in itself caused the ship to

13

be unseaworthy, and you did that in exactly four words.

16

said the judgment is affirmed.

.You

Another landmark case, especially down in our sec­

17
18

tion of the country,

the Gianfalo case, where you had under

19

consideration the review of a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals

20

decision involving whether or not a workman on board a

bellion, but nonetheless the pronouncements of this Court in

4

many of the landmark decisions,. Mahnieh, Crumady, Waldron,

5

Mitchell, Gutierrez -- all of them, it adhered to this same

6

principle of the humanitarian doctrine of species of liability

7

without fault,

B

9

Q

How long has it been since the first ease which

.you have cited?

10

h

Crumady was in 1944.

11

Q

How about Mahnieh?

12

A

I mean Mahnieh was in 1944? and never in all of

13

the occasions that you had to review this question did you re­

14

quire any time lapsing or that this condition had to develop

IS

over a period of time from the act of negligence to the injury.

16

17
18

Q

Has Congress taken any action since those

cases were decided?
h

Ub, Your Honor, they haven't passed any legis­

19

lation concerning this problem since than, no, sir.

And so we

20

say that in answer to Chief Judge Brown, of the Fifth Circuit,

21

when he said, in talking about Mascui311, of course nothing we

22

say about what the Supreme Court said or thought it ©aid can

23

add much to what was said or what it will say it said.

M

Q

E$ss he on the panel that decided this case?

35

A

He was on the panel to decide the Grigsby ease
11

1

in the Fifth Circuit* in which they held that operational

2

negligence was •— brought about unseaworthy conditions* but it

3

wasn't instantaneous.

relating it t© some

10

fictional aspect of its being a hundred yards away from the

IS

vessel?

12

A

Right* may it please Your Honor, but Chief

13

Judge Brown* in writing the opinion, made the statement about

14

Mascuilli and,did make the same statement other than holding

15

that a different panel in Usner held that reverse the district

IS

court* holding that operational negligence didn't make the

17

ship unseaworfhy instantaneously,

18

I make that' statement is that we feel that this Court in

19

Mascuilli has answered the very issue that is being presented

20

here and in no uncertain terms* because you reversed a finding

21

— a district court and a circuit court of appeals decision*

22

based upon facts' which were finding of facts* and it is a

23

question of law that was presented that an instantaneous

24

negligence occurring

25

unseaworthy.

And the only reason that

at the time of the injury made the ship

12

I

Or, in other words,, there is — just because you

2

have an operational negligence occurring at the time of the in­

<£
i>

jury., that in itself doesn't fcafc® away the fact that you have

4

unseaworthiness, because, as was pointed out, many times in

S

the tEaldron'ease and others you don't need any negligence at

6

all to find that there was an unseaworthy condition in the

?

vessel»
Q

As 2 recall,

10

A

Yes, sir, Crumady and Mahnieh.

Do you feel that either of those cases stands

13

A

Yes,

I do, may it please Your Honor, because in

both ©£ those cases, Mahnich and in Crumady, it was based upon

13

the fact that operational negligence created the unseaworthy

Well, 1 think this is true, but 1 had assumed

that your primary argument here was one ©f instantaneous

11

cases cited.

12

A

What I say, in those eases, Crumady and in

13

Mahnich, this Court didn't concern itself with going into the

14

facts or determining what lapse of time is necessary for the

35

choosing of the rotten rope or for the mis-setting of the

16

electrical cutoff device to make it unseaworfcfcy.

n

have done that.

18

You never

And so here you have the situation of where the

19

operational negligence occurred at the same time of the injury,

20

nonetheless you have unseaworthy conditions.

21

for the lapse of time to make this act of negligence jell into

22

or ripen into an uns aworthy condition.

23

Crumady and Mahnich do support Mascuilli, and Mascuilli had

24

before it the very question of instantaneous negligence that

25

we have here, as to whether or not the act of negligence
14

There is no need

And so we say that

5

ship was unseaworthy«

Or to say it another way, just because you

And so we say, may it please Your Honor, that this

we believe, that the Court would not have summarily treated

21

such an important subject.

Addressing ourselves first to the question just

the plaintiff on an unseaworthiness basis, not an operational

are concerned would be limited to seamen as such, to the men

who work on-board ships and not to the harbor workers who

have been given seamen rights and the so-called Sieracki

1 don’t think that the W&idron case held that,

no, if the Court please.

I think you sent it back because the

lower court had taken the unseaworthiness issue away from the

jury.

The unseaworthiness?

Yes.

But the negligence matter was held

I can understand your argument that those cases

should be overruled, but I don’t agree with it.

understand your argument that we haven’t decided against you

23

in this case, previously.

A

But 1 don’t

Oh,, 1 don’t think the Waldron case comes close

to this case, if the Court please, and I don’t think that --

26

1

I think you have to do more than come to that conclusion,

£

come to the conclusion that operational negligence is involved

3

to get to the result in the caldron case.

4

theory spelled out that way to get to the answer in the Waldror

5

case.

6

You don't need that

In Waldron, the condition was there, that was the

7

fact, that two men were doing the work that three or four men

8

should have been doing at that moment, to the same extent as

9

if an improper tool had been given to them to use, and on that

10

basis you had an incompetent crew or incompetent — incomplete

11

work force and that made the ship unseaworfcby.

justify the Waldron case without any difficulty.

In this particular case, if the Court please,

the case comes to you on the Fifth Circuit's statement that

there is no such thing as operational negligence constituting

unseaworthiness which would be actionable by an injured man.

12

We seek an affirmance of that ruling.

as such, does not, on the part of the contract stevedore, does

not give rise to an action against the ship for unseaworthi­

Whether it is instantaneous or not?

It is the same thing, if the Court please,

instantaneous negligence and operational negligence, we would

Q

So what in effect you are doing is asking to

get rid of this line of decision?

ARGUMENT OP H. ALVA BRUMFIELD, ESQ. e

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

8

MR. BRUMFIELD;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

&

may it please Your Honors? with regard, Mr. Justice Marshall,

10

to the dropping of the grease, if the grease is dropped with­

11

out any negligence whatsoever and another seaman or a steve­

12

dore steps on it, my good friend says that is an unseaworthy

13

condition, which 1 agree.

14

grease was dropped on the seaman or worker himself and, say,

IS

hit him in the eye and put his eye out, nonetheless you would

18

have the unseaworthy condition.

17

generated from the Firth Circuit to the effect that there roust

18

be some time element in order for this negligent act. or nan-

19

negligent act to ripen into the unseaworthy condition, is

20

just fiction and is no basis on any decision of this Court.

21

And by the same token if that

And this theory that I think

And just because you have the condition and the

22

causation occurring at the same time or seconds apart, it is

23

the condition itself that is important, the unsafe place to

24

work that is violated, and if that is done by a matter of

?3

seconds or a matter of hours or a matter of days, it would
35

?

not mafee any difference,

3

measuring it, dropped —

Operating a winch was not a condition --

Your Honor?

The man operating a winch was not "a condi-

fciou," it was a man operating a winch *

Right.

Mr. Kohlmeyer says there is a difference.

10

1 say that there is no difference, and this

But the man -~

If

Court has said so in no uncertain terms in the Waldron case,

12

if makes no difference between the equipment and the personnel,

13

because this condition can be brought about by a defective

14

piece of equipment or by negligent operation of the equipment

15

or even by non--negligent operation of the equipment.

Your Honor, you didn't even make that deter-

24

as

Mitchell.

36

1

mi nation.

You said it was there, it was transitory, it was

temporary, it was on the rail, he sipped on it.

How, if it

3

had been there for hours or been there days, 1 say it would

4

maice absolutely no difference whatsoever, because the cond-

5

tion -- it didn't have to be there a matter of hours before

6

this sailor stepped on the rail and he was thrown overboard.

7

It could have been there a second before he stepped on that

8

rail, and this so-called condition — of course, it is an

9

unseaworthy condition, but it is proceeded by some negligence,

10

but that can occur just seconds before or at the same time,

t!

there has to be some negligent act to create the condition,,.

12

Of course, we agree with that.

13

But just because you have an operational negligence,

14

that does not take away from the fact that that operational

13

negligence instantaneously creates an unseaworthy condition.

16

17

Q

I believe you said that that originated, that

idea or concept originated in the Fifth Circuit?

18

A

In the Antoine, Rdbichaux, Dugas eases they

!9

Q

What cases?

20

A

They are cited in my brief — Antoine —

21

Q

They are in your brief?

22

A

Yes

23

Q

Who wrote the first one, do you remember?

24

A

I sureclon't, Hr. Justice Black, but they con­

25

Antoine, Robichaux, Dugas --

cern themselves with a lapse of time, whereas nowhere in this
37

Court, in its decisions in Crumady and Gutierrez, where it

2

happened offshore with beanbags or the -- those cases, nowhere

3

when this question of negligence or non-negligence,

4

a condition of unseaworfchiness, was the time element ever

creating

considered.

6
7

How, you did squarely hold that an instantaneous
operational negligence created unseaworthy conditions, and
you held just as clearly as anything in any decision that you

9

ever pronounced in this Court, because the lower court found
a finding of fact, No. 35,

that says that the operational

1!

negligence occurred, the equipment was seaworthy, and it oc­

iz

curred so instantaneously that the» officer couldn't warn,

13

give any warning' whatsoever.

It occurred then.

How, the court denied that liability and Your
15

Honors reversed it.

Well, that is saying that instantaneous

operational negligence makes the ship instantaneously unsea­
17

worthy and that is how clear that decision is.

18

have to have this lapse of time, when you say it must precede

19

the grease dropping or someone stepping momentarily there­

20

after on the grease spot.

21

was there in a matter of time.

22

And you don't

It makes no difference whether it

The condition is the unsafe place to work, and if

23

that is created by a negligent act, it is unseaworthy, and

M

just because it occurred, seconds before or just because mo­

23

mentarily at the same time, you have the causation and

38

I

condition meeting at the same time, is unseaworthy, and thus

2

what Your Honors have held» you held it in Maseuilli, you did

3

hold this same question before and that is what you did hold

4

in absolutely no uncertain terms.

S

Your Honors, that that is the policy, that is the Maseuilli

6

decision in line with the other decision of Crumady and

7

Mahnich, are justification and authority if -- in the need in

8

making pronouncements, which you certainly held that in

9

Maseuilli, and there is absolutely no question about it.

And we submit, may it please

And as 1 say, here where you have a defective equip­

10
11

ment, may it please Your Honors, to say it one more time,

12

momentarily can create the ship unseaworthy, or any kind of

13

transitory condition can momentarily make that ship unsea­

14

worthy.

VS

ment and personnel ~~

An act of man, there is no distinction between equip­

16

Q .

I think we have your point.

17

A

Yes, that in itself can make it unseaworthy.
