ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS SHERMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. SHERMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;
This case is here on writ of certiorari from the

10
11

United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth District, to review

12

a per curiam opinion assigning the decision, judgment, jury

13

verdict, District Court, in the amount of $152,500 in favor of

14

George Hardeman, an expelled member of the Boilermaker's union,

15

who filed the complaint in the Federal District Court, April

16

1966, under Section 102 of the Landrum-Griffin Act, alleging

17
18

that he had been barred from a full and fair hearing under
Section 101(a)5.
The evidence at the District Court trial v?as of two

19

20

kinds.

First, the various proceedings before the union tribu­

21

nals, such as the 172-page transcript of record of the hearing

22

that was held that resulted in expulsion, which went into the

23

details of his beating up the business manager, which is the

24

principal reason for.his expulsion? and, the proceedings at

25

higher levels, when the case was appealed to the president of
2

1

the International and the executive council of the Inter­

2

national »
The second evidence had to do with loss of wages,

which were computed on the basis of past and future»

Mr»

5

Hardeman was 43 when this incident occurred in October of 1960,

6

and they figured it on the basis of mortality tables that he

7

would retire at 65, $6,000 a year? therefore, plus some punitive

8

damages, they came out with this total figure.
The first part of the case has to do with the issue

We concede:

erred, and the Court of Appeals erred, in a way that is very

important to the labor movement in finding there was no

evidence.

12

threat thereof to intimidate any official of this International

13

14

px-event him from properly discharging the duties of his office.

15

The language of the subordinate lodge constitution

was broader.

It provided for expulsion of any member who

He beat him until he got

18

some kind of statement that satisfied him that Wise wouldn’t

jump him any more on the list.

That was the issue between them.

20

Now? when it got to the District Court — of course?

21

if you get the time relations straight? the incidents occurred

22

in 1960 and this case was before the Federal District Court in

here which might support a finding of guilty under Section 1 of

Article 12, the subordinate lodge by-laws.

The trial body said
They

"They said they found him guilty, and inasmuch as

11

nothing here would support a conviction under this section, I

12

think the verdict cannot stand on his being convicted of

13

penalty, which was expelling him, and 1 think inasmuch as there

14

is no evidence which would support, a finding of guilty under

15

this, that the finding of the board was erroneous and cannot

16

stand in that respect."

17

Now, that is all they charged him with were those two

18

sections and there is nothing in this record that would justify

19

finding him guilty under those sections.

20

phrase "those sections" sounds like he's talking about both

21

sections.

about the fight.

23

Well, the use of the

It is very difficult to understand.

All of it is

"I am telling you as a matter of law that under the

proof the findings which resulted in his being expelled cannot

relationships between the courts and union tribunals, that unior.

the realities of life, recognising that they are not literate

But, this question of dissension and working against

the interest and harmony of the lodge, the local trial board

found him guilty on that account.

18

we think it was reasonable for the board to define dissension

19

and harmony the way they did.

20

reasonable inference is available to administrative tribunals

21

and therefore it certainly should be available to working people

22

who are trying to work out their problems of maintaining the

23

integrity of their institutions.

than a fist fight.

only on the basis of stirring up trouble at the union?

Q

You need to prevail on only one of them.

You

don't have to win on both, do you?
A

That is correct, Your Honor.

We have cited

17

Burke vs. Boilermakers, which pointed out that it is sort of

18

silly to expect unions to say "Guilty as charged on Count 1;

19

Guilty as charged on Count 2."

20

Q

Well, wasn't that guilty of dissension or guilty

21

on that other charge of intimidation.

22

either, I gather your position is you were?

23

A

If there is evidence on

That is correct^ because the language of the

24

by-law is this broad that it permits the punishment of one by

then the punishment should have been upheld»
Your Honor,, this presents a more serious question on

granting an award which seamed inconsistent to our system of

trying to repair injuries if injuries have been received.

a

Because under this award , as you can see from the amounts in­

9

volved/ the plaintiff by not seeking reinstatement/ he didn't

10

seek reinstatement in this case, has managed to create pecuniary

11

result in which he acquires an estate with interest even com­

question of whether unions can be responsible.

indulgence to read from a decision of the Fourth Circuit Court

17

of Appeals rendered by Judge Soboloff.

upon which the responsibility of the union rests in terms, for

20

example, of handling wildcat strikers.

I beg your

That's not just a figment of my imagination.

22

Parks case is an illustration of what happens when a union tries

23

to assert its powers to maintain the validity of peaceful

24

institutions, in that case the maintenance of a council of

25

industrial relations which has maintained peace in the electrics 1

contracting industry for 50 years,,

Judge Soboloff saids

"By the judicial application of ad hoc stands in the

3

pursuit of what is called democracy in union government* we

4

have succeeded only in introducing not democracy but chaos.

5

This would not only tend to disintegrate the labor movement

6

but be responsible for generating serious implications for

7

employers* and others as well.'9

8
9

That is one of the serious problems facing the labor
movement today* that when the internationals are asked to

10

assert their powers to maintain responsibility* such as

11

suppressing a jurisdictional strike* that the cry comes back*

12

"How are you going to protect us against cases like Hardeman?

13

How are you going to make sure we are going to do the job to

14

satisfy courts?"

15

Of course, we can tell them, as lawyers, that reason­

16

able standards* reasonable risks* should be taken, as they were

17

in the Parks case.

18

smashed aside* I think complete abandonment of the proper rules

19

of review and the substitution of the court's views* are the

20

sort of thing that are preventing us from doing what should be

21

done not only in the interest of the labor movement but also

22

of others in the collective bargaining relationship.

23
24
25

Q

In cases of this sort* which has been

Is the issue that you've got a money judgment

against the union?
A

Yes* sir.

10

Q

How much?

A

$152,500 for one expelled

member.

In the Parks case, we were dealing with 1,000 people.
In the case of Barriman vs. Nevada which is at 85 Pacific 2nd
250, there were 41 wildcat strikers involved.
Q

Would you raise your voice a little, counsel?

It is a little hard for us to hear you.
Mr. Sherman, let me ask you a question, may I?
Suppose that the evidence here were to justify or would qualify
only under Article 12 of the local’s by-laws, but not under
Article 13.
A

Would expulsion be justified?
Yes, Your Honor.

Q

And you would say this because why?

A

Because the blow of the fist is the thing that

was intended to be suppressed, and that was because in working
out the allocation of jobs, resort to violence on the part of
those who are concerned with the administration of the referral
system ought to be a very serious matter.
Q

Well, Article 13 provides specifically for

expulsion, but Article 12 does not.
A
Q

It provides only for ——

Punishment as warranted by the offense.
Yes, and why doesn't the article go further

then?
A

Beg your pardon?

Q

Why doesn't Article 12 go
11

further?

1

A

Do you mean

2

Q

Why doesnst it also provide for expulsion?

3

A

Well * I think that it depends upon the circum­

4

stances in the case»

5

to appreciate what was going on in Local Lodge 112 at the time»
Q

6

It is very hard for a court at any level

Well, your theory must be, then, that the

7

language "as warranted by the offense" necessarily includes

8

expulsion?

9

A

Yes.

It might be a fine, it might be suspen­

10

sion, it might be expulsion.

As a matter of fact, here they

it

expelled him indefinitely.

12

what they meant by that, but there was no effort made on his

Xfc8s a little hard to understand
|
i
i

13
14

part to secure reinstatement*
Q

And therefore, your argument must be to the

15

effect that conviction, so to speak, under either article

16

justifies expulsion and hence the general verdict, if I may call

17

it that, tied in with the evidence?
A

That is correct.

19

Q

All right.

20

A

But, essentially, what it amounts to is that

18

I

21

you leave in the hands of the people involved — now, under this

22

constitution, the local union, the brothers themselves, voted

23

i

j

i
for expulsion.

They had a trial committee that considered the

24

evidence and made a report, and then the local committee voted

25

him guilty and it voted expulsion.
12

So, therefore, there was a

i

1
2

concerted determination by the people involved.
Q

Would you say this is somewhat like a situation

3

where a man-is convicted in a criminal case on two counts, each

4

of which has a five-year penalty, but he is given two five-year

S

sentences to run concurrently, and this situation is somewhat

6

analagous to that?

1

A

That is correct, and as a matter of fact in

8

Burke vs. Boilermakers, which is a per curiam affirmance by

9

the Ninth Circuit, exactly that is xdiat happened.

They had a

io

series of charges on which, when one fell out, the Court said

ii

there was no evidence on one but upheld the punishment because

12

it had been proved on the others.

13
14

We have cited the criminal law as of the reason for
the position that was taken.

15

I would like to take just a few minutes -—

16

Q

M
18

May I ask you one question?

How much of the

damages awarded was labeled compensatory and how much punitive?
A

The best I can ascertain, $130,000 was labeled

19

as compensatory, and $20,000 was labeled as punitive.

20

not labeled, but the presentation of the position by the

21

attorney for the complainant was that he was 43 years old and

22

he would retire at 65, and the number of years times the salary

23

would come out that figure, so we deduced that as the division

24

between compensatory and punitive.

25

20 years old and planned to work until 70, it would have been a
13

It was

Of course, if he had been

1
2
3

larger judgment,
Q'

would have recovered had he remained employed?

4

A

S

Q

6
7

Is that the present value of the amount he

Well —
Computed on that basis, or just computed on

the basis of so much per year?
A

It was computed on the basis of so much per

8

year because although they recognized the principle of

9

mitigation of damages, for some reason or other the evidence

JO

before the jury showed that he was living on $300 a year, and

11

even though full employment was coming up, they didn8t pay any

12

attention to that,

13

Q

14

A

But, I don't want to bespeak the jury,

I understand, I just was curious
I would like to spend a minute or two on the

15

question that is sometimes labeled preemption.

16

we are not right about the first part of the case, but we

17

strongly feel we are, there are very strong public reasons for

18

establishing a rule of review which will permit the union

19

tribunals to function,

20

Assuming that

I don’t think the word "preemption" is quite descrip­

21

tive of our problem here.

We have a case in which the Federal

22

Congress has adopted a statute, and certainly there is no con­

23

stitutional bar to the Federal Government adopting a statute,

24

the Congress adopting a statute, through which they would give

25

a duplicate remedy on the so-called refusal to refer.
14

!

There is a lot of evidence in the case, exclusive

2

referral system, non-exclusive referral system, loss of wages

3

and the rest of it.

4

The question is whether Congress intended by Section 102 to

5

establish a duplicate remedy.

6

It was sort of a junior NLRB proceeding.

We think that as a matter of statutory construction

7

that it did not so intend.

We recognize that if you take a

8

dictionary and use the words "appropriate relief" and chase it

&

down to the end of the scope of that term you may come out with

10

the answer that, "Yep, they did intend it."

11

is something like Amazon Cotton Mills.

12

But, I think it

The plaintiffs in that case back in 848 tried to

13

find a basis to maintain injunction suits against picketing

14

because the language of the statutes provided that unions could

15

be sued for the first time.

16

sort of ridiculous, Congress entrusted that function to the

The court said, "Well, this is

17

National Labor Relations Board> a centralized agency with

IB

procedures for complaint, trial examiner hearings, and a

19

centralized agency to make decisions.

20

transfer the functions to 200 or more local tribunals with

21

general jurisdiction.

22

Q

23

It didn't mean to

But you don't find any of this on the face of

101(a)5, do you?

24

A

No, I think we are looking at 102.

25

Q

Well, even looking at 102, do you find that on
15

i

the face of 102?

2
3

A

1 think* on the face of 102* it looks like just

appropriate relief.
Q

4

I gather your argument is to the effect of what

S

102 says is* this is available to you unless you want to go

6

to the National Labor Relations Board.

7

saying?
A

8
9
iO

Is that what you are

No, what I am saying is that Congress could

have written the statute in such a way as to establish a
duplicate remedy, but it did not do so.

n

Q

And therefore* that is my point.

Therefore*

12

you say there is no action under 101(a)5* and what you have to

13

do is go to the National Labor Relations Board.
A

14

I’m sorry* that is correct* unless he had

15

sought restoration of union membership.

16

restoration of union membership* then he would have been in the

17

right place.

18

Q

19

A

If ha had sought

What remedy could he get before the board?
Well* he could get the same remedy that any

20

other union member could get if there had been a refusal to

21

refer him because of trouble with the union.

22

Union case.
He could get the same remedy that any non-union persor

23

25

Radio Officer’s

could get.
Q

Damages?
16

I

A

Back pay and reinstatement to his job.

z

Q

Bat not damages?

3

A

Yes, well it would be damages in the sense of

4
5

back pay.
In addition, I think that some of the trouble on this

6

point arises from the words "appropriate relief (including

7

injunctions."

8

referred to it on roman numeral VII, cited, Second Volume of

9

Legislative History 1102.

10

We checked back over the legislative history

You have to know a little bit about the background

11

of this legislation to realize that first there was the

12

McClellan Amendment, the Bill of Rights, which came up on the

S3

floor, passed by a very narrow vote, and then as is evidenced

14

by McClellan's own testimony, the labor movement got involved

15

and helped to draft the Kiekel substitute, which was intended

16

to cut down the scope of the McClellan Amendment.

17
18

So, we look at the McClellan Amendment, and that
provides a comparable provision -- -

Where is it?

A

I'm reading from a copy.

21

Where are you reading from?
I regret to say that

we haven't ordered it in the brief.

Then you are not reading from the brief?

No.

We cited it in the brief at page seven.

The Secretary of Labor was

restrain any such violations in talking plans of this title.

We submit that McClellan certainly did not have in

4

mind, and Congress didn8fc have in mind in drafting that bill,

5

passing that bill, that the Secretary of Labor would have a

6

duplicate function in administering the National Labor Rela­

7

provided for by private action, intended to cut down the scope

of the McClellan Amendment, that there was no such intention.

a proper understanding of the Court of Appeal's opinion.
The Court of Appeals said that when the member of

13
14

the union beat up one of the leaders, this was not a violation

15

of the clause, this was not creating dissension among members

16

and not working against the interests and harmony of the

17

International Brotherhood.

18

of Appeals says, is it not?

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT MCDONALD, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

5

MR. MCDONALD:

6
7

Yes, sir»

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Members of

the Court:

8

This is the first appearance I have made before this

9

honorable Court and I might say it is an honor to appear here.

10
11

It is the high point of my career.
This case is here on two issues that you granted

12

certiorari on: the issue of standard of review applied by the

13

Court of Appeals and the District Court, and the issue of

14

preemption.

15

Q

Where was it tried?

16

A

It was tried in Mobile, Alabama, before Judge

17
18

Daniel Thomas, Mr. Justice Black.
To understand the standard of review, I might recite

19

the facts, as Chief Justice Burger pointed out.

20

board found Mr. Hardeman, as well as Mr. Braswell, because we

21

are also reviewing the Braswell opinion here, guilty of two

22

charges, Article 12, Section 1 and Article 13, Section 1.

23

Now, what they had done, in effect,

24

them with those two charges.

25

said, "We find you guilty as charged."

The union tria!

to charge

The trial board came back and

19

Now, we came into court

1

alleging in our complaint that we had been denied a full and

2

fair hearing because the evidence did not support a finding of

3

guilt? or was there any evidence to support a finding of guilt

4

under Article 13, Section h
Our position was this:

S

that Mr. Hardeman, as well as

6

Mr. Braswell, were in the same position as a man on trial in

7

a criminal case with a two-count indictment, one count charging

6

him with a simple assault, the second count charging him with

9

rape, there being evidence of a simple assault but no evidence

10

of any sexual contact, but the jury coming in and finding him

11

guilty as charged.

12

the rape count, and that3s what happened here.

Well, guilty as charged necessarily includes

Now, we had two counts, or two charges, against Mr.

13
14

Hardeman and Mr. Braswell in this case, and the first charge

15

was — well, one which stated that through the use of force or

16

violence that Hardeman tried to restrain, force or intimidate

17

an official of the Brotherhood.

18

tally there is no punishment set forth there, it is open.

19

Apparently, the punishment can foe administered according to the

20

offense.

21

The second charge — inciden­

The second charge was Article 13, Section 1, of the

22

International constitution, which points out that any member

23

who creates dissension among the members or who seeks to create

24

a dissolution of the Brotherhood or a division of parts — in

25

essence, it describes someone who is trying to dissolve the
20

1

union as an organization...

2

who is guilty of this will be suspended -- will be, not

3

suspended, but expelled from the Brotherhood.

4

Now, it doesn't leave any question.

And, that article says that anyone

There is no

5

lesser penalty.

6

you commit first-degree murder you will be sentenced for life

7

or your life will be taken from you,

8

does.

0

It's just like a State statute that says if

That is what Article 13

It's a much more serious penalty.
Now, when he was found guilty, when these men were

10

found guilty, the expulsion vote that Mr, Sherman mentioned

11

was really superfluous.

12

done it, or if they had voted not to expel! them, they would

13

have still been expelled by virtue of the fact they were found

14

guilty under Article 13, Section 1,

They didn’t need — if they hadn’t

15

It should be noted these gentlemen took necessary

16

appeals in the union, and in doing so they were necessarily

17

prejudiced in their defense because they had to presume they

18

were found guilty of both, and so, by doing this, they had to

19

be found guilty of both,

20

Q

Do you think the situation would be any differ­

21

ent if instead of saying "guilty as charged,” they said we

22

two brothers guilty and then recited the original charge?

23
24
25

A

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I do think it would

have been different.
Q

Tell me how.
21

A

I

I think this.

If they had found the members

2

guilty of Article 12, Section 1, they could have said, "For a

3

penalty, we will fine you $100 each," or "We will suspend you

4

for six months.”

5

will leave it up to a vote of the Brotherhood.”

6

Or they could have said, "For a penalty, we

And when it came before the Brotherhood, when a

7

motion for expulsion was offered, the Brotherhood would have

8

said, "Weil, no, let's vote against this because it is too

9

harsh."

As it was, when the motion for expulsion was offered

10

the Brotherhood knew they had been found guilty of a section

11

demanding expulsion, so why not go ahead and vote for it?

12

Q

Mr. Sherman, just to that second point of

13

expulsion, am I correct that Mr. Hardeman testified that he was

14

sitting there quite worried about how the officers were

15

ruining the local and everything, and he concluded that some-

16

thing had to be done and therefore concluded that he had to

17

punch this man?

18

A

Mr. Justice Marshall, that is correct.

19

Q

Well, isn't that dissension?

20

A

No, sir, that —-

21

Q

Well, isn't it mild disapproval?

22

A

Sir?

23

Q

Is it mild disapproval?

24

A

It v/ould not be dissension within the meaning

25

of Article 13-1.

To say it v/ould would be — if you be guilty
22

1

of dissension under 13-1 in doing that, well, then, you could

2

also say that someone who is presumptive enough when election

3

comes around to run against the business agent in the election,

4

to run for his job, now this man is certainly creating more

5

dissension in the union and causing a division of difference of

6

opinion there»

Maybe I should take judicial notice of that —-

Yes, sir.

But, nonetheless, the members could

have taken, if they found them guilty only of Article 12 and

have found, decided a punishment that would have been consistent

21

that if he is guilty of one, you’re saying here that he could

get the same punishment under both charges, but on the other

you read the article together in its context, it becomes obvious

18

of course, maybe it doesn't — but it becomes obvious to me

19

and apparently to the Justices who have reviewed this, that this

20

article prohibits some attack against the organizational

21

structure, itself, in that we're not saying here that Hardeman

should not have been disciplined, that a court should just

decide within the plain meaning of the ordinary meaning of a

4

a mandate that the Court do it, because Congress has said that

5

no member shall be expelled without a full and fair hearing,

6

and in order to fulfill the wishes of Congress in 101(a)5c,

7

you’ve got to

8

Q

9

A

Mr. Justice Brennan, let me say this in regard

10

to that.

All of the courts of appeal, and Mr. Sherman admits

11

it in his brief, have ruled that in order to have a full and

12

fair hearing there must be some evidence to support the

13

charge.
Q

14

A

15

No, sir, because I submit it's not, because

16

if you’re going to say, "Look and see if there is soma evidence

17

we've got to interpret the charge to see if there is some

18

evidence.

20

The issue is two different sides of the same coin,
or looking through the same window from opposide sides.
Q

If anybody is to interpret it, isn’t the NLRB

better able to do it than the Court?
A

No, sir, Mr. Justice Harlan, because the courts
35

ft

1

of course have more training in this type of thing, the use of

2

words and interpreting the meaning of words, and because

3

Congress gave the mandat® to the courts in Title 29, Section

4

412, saying that any person whose rights are infringed upon

5

in this area shall have recourse in the Federal District Court,

6

which brings us to the second area, the preemption argument,

7

which I have a — would like to say just a few things about.

8
9

In regard to the preemption issue, which is the
second issue that this comes into here, we have to understand

to

the reason for preemption is that what the courts have said in

n

preemption is that Congress has carved out this area for the

12

NLRB to operate in, and therefore they kept the State Courts

13

from operating in that sphere.

14

Now, in this area, the preemption does not apply

15

because Congress in 29-412, says he can bring a civil action

16

for such relief as may be appropriate.

17

and our proof shows, that the wrong was done and we said as

18

approximate results of this wrong this man lost wages for this

19

time, and if approximate results is not appropriate relief

20

there can be no appropriate relief.

21

little looser than approximate results in damages and approxi­

22

mate causes and things approximately caused.

23

Now, in our complaint,

Appropriate relief is a

Gentlemen, this is an important case.

I don't have

24

to tell you that, or I wouldn't be here.

his problems are held by every member of the labor movement
36

Hardeman is a man?

1

in this country*

And, the whole purpose Of our labor laws is

2

to protect the individual rights and the individual working

3

man, and this decision, this case, as long as it stands, will

4

protect every working individual in the United States from

5

such wrongful expulsion as Hardeman suffered*

6

I think it is necessary.

It is a good decision, and

7

on behalf of Mr. Hardeman, my client, and on behalf of the

8

members of labor unions in this country, I hope you will affirm

9

the decision with a strong opinion to protect them in the

11

future,
Q

Mr. McDonald, I have one last, detail.

Do you

12

feel that entering into the amount of this verdict was anything

t3

having to do with the hiring hall practices?

14

A

No, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I don't.

What we

15

did is we presented the evidence here showing that Hardeman

16

showed his income tax returns that he made so much before his

17

expulsion, and then afterwards we showed that he could not get

18

jobs, get work as a boilermaker even though he made every effort

19

to, and then we showed his income tax return showing the earn­

20

ings he had made for several years after the expulsion.

21

difference then showed it.

22

The

He was a man who was 43 years of age, who had spent

23

his life acquiring a trade, which is a technical trade just like

24

my trade of practicing law is something that I acquired, and

25

then all of a sudden it was taken away from him.
37

What could he

do at 43?

value to him.

He wasn’t able to adapt to find something of esjual

Q

Conceding then that anything having to do with

4

a hiring lav; aspect is clearly for the Board* 1 take it you are

5

saying that there is no element of damage in this result that

6

is attributable to the hiring hall phase of this controversy*

7

and what was done in the hiring hall?

8

A

No, sir* it was the --

9

Q

Damage I understood you just now to say* and

10

I’m merely asking as a corollary to that whether you are con-

11

ceding that anything having to do with the hiring hall is for

12

the Labor Board and not for the Court?

13
14

A

Mo, Your Honor* I'm not* because the — we’re

relying on the Act to getting jurisdiction to the Court.

15

Thank you very much* gentlemen.

16

Q

17

Do you have anything further* Mr. Sherman?

18

A

Thank you* Mr. McDonald.

Yes* I have one small point* and that is to

19

call the attention of the Court to Defendant’s Exhibit Mo. 3*

20

page 61* which is the out-of-work card of the union.

21

notice that the rules for the administration of the hiring hall

22

are set forth that call for re-registration each month.

for a job where he lasted for five days.

There

He made another entry in April* 1961* and the issue
38

i

really was whether his name continued on the list as a legal

2

matter because it had been on once, or whether the union rule

3

prevailed that if you didn0t re-register each month, which is

4

a normally accepted rule with the Board, that he wasn't eligible

for further referrals,

Q

Thank you, Mr. McDonald.

The case is submitted,
