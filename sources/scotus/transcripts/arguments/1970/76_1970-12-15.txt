ORAL ARGUMENT BY ISAAC N. GROWER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OP PETITIONERS

?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

1©

Mr. Groner, you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
MR. GRONER:

9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
In this case which is here on writ of certiorari to I
i

1!

the Supreme Court of the State of Idaho, preemption is the

12

issue: whether the state court had jurisdiction over the action

13

which Respondent, Wilson P. Lockridge, filed against Petitioner

14

unions^ or whether the state, courts had no jurisdiction because

!5

Congress has regulated the union conduct involved in this case

16

under the Labor Management Relations Act.

17

For some years prior to 1959 the Respondent
■

18

Lockridge was an interstate bus driver employed by the Greyhound

19

Bus Company,

20

bargaining contract between Greyhound and the Petitioner, the

21

Local Division'. ’

pursuant to the checkoff clause in the collective

22

Lockridge had been maintaining his union dues pay­

23

ments and also his employment with the Greyhound, inasmuch as

24

the collective bargaining agreement provided that all employees

25

shall remain members as a condition precedent to continued
2

I
2

eHipl©yraan.t*

The union constitution provided that where agreements

3

with employing companies provide that members must be in con­

4

tinuous good financial standing, the member in arrears one

S

month may be suspended from membershipand removed from employ­

6

ment, in compliance with the terns of the agreement-

7

In August 1959,, Lockridge and some others voluntar­

8

ily revoked their checkoff arrangement-

9

assumed the responsibility of maintaining 'their union dues

They voluntarily

10

payments timely , to maintain, thair membership in the union and

II

also to maintain their employment-

12

In August 1959 and also in October 1959 the union

13

in writing advised Lockridge of the provisions to which I have

14

adverted, and pointed out that he had the responsibility to

15

maintain these payments-

16

payments to become delinquent and the union so advised the.

17

Greyhound, and in November 1959, being delinquent in his dues

18

for the month of October, the union advised Greyhound of the

19

delinquency and Greyhound discharged Lockridge-

20
21

Q

Nevertheless,

'he

permitted his

How long after his delinquency arose for the

October dues, did the union terminate him?
A

22

The union, Your Honor, did not terminate him-

23

The union advised the company on November 2nd, his delinquency

24

having arisen on November 1st.

25

Q

When did they notify him that he was out of
3

1

the union?

2

A

They —

3

Q

For nonpayment of dues.

4

A

They had advised him,,

Your Honor,in advance

5

that he would be out of the union if he permitted his delin­

6

quency to be in arrears more than one month, but —

7
3

Q

Well, xtfhat I'm trying to get at is? how many

hours or days is, was he delinquent when the axe struck?

9

A

He was delinquent for about 43 hours.

10

Q

Forty-eight hours„

11

A

Yes, that is correct,

12

After having

13

Q

Your Honor.

Does the union uniformly act in that way on

14

every — nonpayment of dues in every case?

15

show anything on that score?

16
17
18

A

Or does this record

The record indicates three things with respect

to that, Mr. Chief Justice.
First of all, that it acted uniformly with respect

19

to ©yeryone who had been given thesemotifications and were in

20

this precise delinquency.

21

But there is only one other such member and employee,
named Elmer J. Day.

It also shows as a finding of fact that

23

the union had suffered delinquencies — had parsaifefc&S other

24

people who were in arrears a comparable length'of time to re­

5

main in membership and to remain in employment, but there was

4

1

nothing indicated that they had received the kind of notices

2

which Messrs Lockridge and Day had received here.
In any event, Lockridge did not file a charge with

3
4

the National Labor Relations Board alleging either that he had

5

not been treated like others in the same situation, or

6

any other allegation of unfair labor practice under a Federal

7

Act.

8
9

-making

In September, 1960, as a resident of Idaho he in­
stituted an action in the District Court for Boise, the Idaho

10

District Court for Boise, against Petitioner unions and

11

originally also against Greyhound, naming Greyhound as a party

i 2.

defendant and including also a count specifically directed to

'13

the just cause provision of the collective bargaining agreement

14

and alleging that Greyhound had violated that.

15

Prior to any judicial action on the original com­

16

plaint, however, Lockridge filed an amended complaint, which

17

removed Greyhound as a party defendant and also removed the

18

particular count which had been addressed to Greyhound in its

19

action under the collective bargaining contract.

20

Basically, in that amended complaint there were, in

21

essence, three counts. Ones tortious interference with employ­

22

ment! twos violation of a contract between the union and a

23

member, and threes conspiracy, all purporting to be stated under

24

state law.

25

The union filed a motion to dismiss, including.

5

%

among other things the particular ground that the subject

2

matter of Loekridgec s actions was preempted by virtue of its

3

regulation under the Labor Management Relations Act.

4

The District Judge granted that motion, relying in

5

principal part upon this Court’s decision in the Carman case.

6

Loekridge appealed.
In 1962 the Idaho Supreme Court reversed, holding

7
3

that it was confused by the preemption decisions of this Court

9

and in particular, purporting to see confusion between the

10

decision of this Court in the Gonzales case and the decision of

n

this Court in the Carman case.

12

The case was remanded for trial.

Prior to trial there was another amendment to the

13

complaint.

n

particular in the second, and only complaint which was -the basis

15

for the charge, all that Loekridge said was; money damages.

16

At ho time did he request the relief of restoration to union

M

membership.

18

ages and punitive damages.

19

he excised the count which was addressed to punitive damages

20

and he also cut out the prayer of a request for punitive dam­

2!

ages .

22

In all of 'these complaints, and of course, in

He had originally sought both compensatory dam­
But in his second amended complaint

In a preliminary ruling prior to trial, the Idaho

23

District Court ruled that there was no ambiguity in the

24

documents involved, in essence, holding that the contract re­

25

quires that the employee remain a member, whereas the

6

1

constitution required that members must be — the constitution

2

referred to contracts which required that members must be in

3

continuous good financial standing. The Court purporting to

4

find that difference unambiguous and declining to permit the

5

union to file an affidavit, both from their officers and from

6

Greyhound representatives which stated that no difference was

7

intended between teh language and no difference was intended

8

in the interpretation and application ofthe collective bargain­

9

ing agreement applicable here and other collective bargaining

10

agreements applicable to other drivers in the same bargaining

n

unit, which did have the continuous and good financial stand­

12

ing language.

13

The trial was devoted primarily to damages.

The

14

District Judge in Idaho held again that he believed that the

15

matter was preempted and that the union3 s position in this

18

respect had been, strengthened by the decisions of this Court

17

in Borden and in Perko.

18

The 1962 decision in the Idaho Supreme Court was

19

rendered prior to the decision of this Court —- decisions of

20

this Court in Borden and in Perko.

21

Supreme Court in 1962 relied upon the state supreme court

22

decisions in Borden and in Perko which were, of course, rever­

23

sed on preemption grounds by the decisions of this Court.

And indeed, the Idaho

24

The Idaho District Judge felt, however, that he was

25

mandated to proceed by the Idaho Supreme Court decision and he

7

1

awarded damages, which, with interest,, approximate $50,000 and

E |

An appeal was taken by the unions on the grounds of preemption.

3

The decision below affirmed, by a vote of 4 to 1, both the

4

majority and the dissenting opinions confining themselves to

5

the issue of preemption and indeed, almost entirely to a dis­

s

cussion of the decisions of this Court featuring Borden and

7

Perko,
Q

8
9

My, Groner, may 1 ask you a qisestion here,,

a general question.

Bo you accept the idea that3s been

10

expressed by several courts of appeals «— X8m not sure it8s

11

ever been articulated here ~ that a union in relation to its

12

members, is a trustee, a fiduciary and has all the duties of a

13

'fiduciary toward its members?
A

14

Well, there is no question that unions in

15

general have a duty of fairly representing all those in the

16

bargaining units

?y

in the affirmative, Mr, Chief Justice,
Q

is

To that extent I would answer your question

Well, I'll go a little further.

Do you

19

embrace within the fiduciary duty to the extent you accept

20

the fiduciary idea, the concept that they have a duty of fair

21

dealing to the point of protecting him and aiding Jim in every

22

way?

23

A

Mo, sir.

No, Your Honor,

24

Q

You mean he8 s an adversary?

25

A

In this case he comported himself as one.
8

1

He -Q

2

Forty-eight hours — an a 48-hour delinquency

3

in his dues he becomes an adversary in the instead of a bene­

4

ficiary?

5

A

Well, there are other alternatives. Your

6

Honor, between being an outright adversary.and responding to

7

a question that the union must defend him in every way®

8

certainly would not accept the proposition that the duty of

©

fair representation is so broad where it at least where there

I

10

isn't presented all the factual reference which would indicate

n

how broad you would like to extend it»

12

With respect to this particular case, Mr„ Chief

13

Justice, if your question was directed to it, the duty about

14

which you inquired was never invoked by Lockridge.

15

a count which sought punitive damages and he excised that and

16

even in that count he did not purport to rely upon any duty of

17

fair representation and the reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice,

18

in our view, it was quite obvious he wanted no part of any

19

Federal law*

20

possibly be felt to be based on Section 301 so as to give rise

2i

to a right of removal in the union, a right of removal to the

22

Federal District Court, which would be aequaintedwith the act,

23

to a Court of Appeals which had had eases under Section 8(b)(2) ©i

24

the National Labor Relations Act which is directly in point.

25

He had

He wanted no part of any action that could

The fiduciary duty of which Your Honor may be
9

1

thinking, if 1 may try to make it somewhat more precise, the

z

duty of a union to advise the member when he is delinquent in

3

his dues arid fc© the extent to which he is delinquent in his

4

dues, is a duty which has been spelled out by the National

S

Labor Relations Board in its decisions under Section 8fb)(2)

6

and it is precisely — that is precisely the basis of# or one

7

of the bases of our fundamental position -that the judgment

8

below must be reversed on preemption grounds, for two differ­

9

ent reasons.

10
11

12

One is that Congress has occupied the field of
this union activity.
Q

Let’s assume that all he had asked for in

13

his suit was restoration of his membershipin the union.

14

his sole claim.

15

A

That5s

If that was all he asked for in the suit and

16

if all the other circumstances indicated that the crux of the ,

17

action was the membership relationship rather than the employ­

18

ment relationship# then the state courts would have had juris­

19

diction to adjudicate.

20
21

Q

To sue just on a contract basis, or to enter-

tain whatever his action was?

22

A

No, Your Honor? no.

23

Q

Given your supposition that the state court

24
25

could have entertained it?
A

Oh, yes.

And could have granted the relief
10

I

z
3

of restoration to union membership»
Q

But if he said* !SX ©Is© want* by the way * not

only restoration* font i would like some damages for my lost

4

wages which I lost because 1 didn’t have my membership.

5

wrongfully deprived of my membership."

6

prayer in his complaint is he out of court right then?

7

A

1 was

Now* if he adds that

I do not think that 1 can answer your

8

question directly* Mr. Justice White, because it would depend

9

upon many other factors.

It depends* as this Court said in

10

Borden and Perko* upon a decision as to what the crux of the

n

action is* and that would depend upon what he sought in his

12

action* what.he said in his complaint* as well as perhaps upon

13

other things.

14

Q

Well* he gays: I was wrongfully terminated

15

from membership in the union and I want my membership back and

16

I want damages for lost wages.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

The damages for lost wages* were the wages*

of 'course* that would relate to employment.

The state court

would have no jurisdiction to grant it.
Q

In any circumstances?

A

Under any circumstances.

Yes* Your Honor.

The only issue would be whether the state court would
have any jurisdiction in the premisis if* in the initial analy­
sis the conclusion were reached* as it must be in this case* in
our view* that the nub of the action is the employment

11

1

relationship, then the state court would have no jurisdiction,,

z

Butf in any event,, their jurisdiction would be IMi&dd to

3

granting relief under the, under that part of the action which

4

did not impinge upon Federal Law, or that part of the relief

5

which the National Labor Relations Board could not give®
Q

6

And you would give the same answer if he had

7

already gone to the general counsel and filed the complaint and

8

the general counsel had rejected it and then he said, "Well, 1

9

must get a hearing someplace.

I6m going to go to court."

10

You would say he couldn9t go to court then, either?

II

A

Yes, Your Honor, I would say'that he could

IE

not, and that this Court has made clear in its decisions that

13

the action or inaction of the board does not provide an except

14

tion to a preemption principle®

15

Your Honor is aware, he did not go to the National Labor Re­

16

lations Board®

17

of regularity with respect to the general Counsel.

18

counsel presumably would issue a complaint if the facts which

19

he submitted would indicate that there had been a violation of

20

the act®

2!

been a violation of Section 3(b)(2) and Section 8(b)(1) ~

22

In this case, of course, as

Also, Your Honor, there must be an assumption
The general

And under the facts as he states them there would have

Q

If he had alleged discriminatory conduct

23

amounting to what he alleged was a ~ breached the duty of

24

fair representation, he eouldhave stayed in court?

25

A

If he had done so?
12

•1

z

If he had done so, yes? he could have stayed in
court but-he could not have stayed in the state court because
.

3

that would have given rise to our right to remove and to our

4

right to appeal to the Ninth Circuit an,d in our view, that

S

would haveled to a far different consideration of the case and

6

it would have lad to a far different result*

7

because these state courts are not acquainted with labor cases

8

and had no experience with the Labor Relations Act, that we

9

find ourselves as petitioners here, in our view*

It is precisely

But, in any

event he did not do that and this.-was a deliberate election*
Q

Well, Mr* Groner, what difference do punitive

damages make, if any?
A

I'm sorry, I didn*t understand -~

Q

What difference does it make that he also

asked for punitive damages.

That is not necessary at all in

your case, is it?
A

Well, he originally asked for but then with­

drew it and I quote that partly by v?ay of a history of the

19

case, but also by way of lending some color to what we say is a

20

deliberate election not to allege any breach of fiduciary duty

21

and there is no such issue in the case.

22
23
24

25

He did not allege it?

indeed he did not ask for punitive damages? the District Court
found that petitioners acted out of an honest interpretation
of what their legal rights were and the court below also found
that this was an honest misunderstanding with respect to the
13

!

legal documents involved and there had been no discrimination„

z

Mr. Justice White, in the invidious sense of deliberately an

3

individual matter.

4

Under the findings here the union acted in good

5

faith, but. the issue of' good faith was never fairly litigated

6

because he never alleged it and it was never tried.

No.

1959 so that by the time —
Q

Well, what 18m trying to get at is that's the

13

same thing he would have gotten if the, in the law if he had

14

agreed to it and had given him back wages?

15

A

Right.

It is the back wages, yes, but the

16

back pay would not have been such a large amount because he

17

would have to file the charge within six months and presumably

18

the board, however slowly it may rim in some cases, it would

19

have discharged of this case prior to the 11 years which have

20

elapsed on its way to this Court.

2!

Q

Mr. Groner, assume that it did not go to any

22

Federal Court, pursuant to your efforts, would the Federal

23

Court have been obliged, notwithstanding the preemption doc­

24

trine, or consistent with the preemption doctrine, to apply

25

basic rules of equity that were prevailing in the state where
14

1

the problem originated?

20

A

It is — in any lawsuit, Your Honor, no?

indeed decisive.

parties and both courts, -there is no room for such considera­
tions .

4

In any event, Mr» Chief Justice, we had been dis­

3

cussing matters which are related more to the merits than to

6

the issue of jurisdiction»

7

is an issue of jurisdiction as to whether a state courts could

0

exercise any jurisdiction under the decisions of this Court

9

and in particular, Borden and Perko»

In our view all we would have here

And under the prescrip­

10

tions of the Congress which, in Sections 8fb)(2) and 7 and

11

some of the others, have covered all cases involving union

12

conduct of requesting or obtaining an employee's discharge by

13

advising the employer that he has been delinquent in his dues.

14

Congress has made all such activities, either pro-

15

tected or considered and therefore Congress has occupied the

16

field and therefore Congress — and therefore the uniori con­

17

duct involved here is, arguably, either an unfair labor prac­

18

tice or protected activity and ~

19

Q

X suppose it’s difficult to -talk that

20

abstractedly,

21

the board and the board had decided that there was no unfair

22

labor practice here»

23

the employee would have no remedy against the union under his

24

contract with the union1 just because the board found out that

25

whatever the union did didn't amount to an unfair labor

but let's assume that this matter had gone to

Now, is it your position that therefore,

16

1
2

practice?
A

Well,, I don't know as it would foe therefor,

3

but with respect to the union conduct directed to his employ­

4

ment relationship? yes, there would be no remedy»

5

has carved this out and put it beyond the state domain»

6

Congress

Now, had he brought a suit solely to restoring his

7

union membership, that would have been a different matter if

8

the crux of that action had been the membership relationship

9

rather than the employment relationship»

10

n
i2

Q

You mean that would be within the jurisdic­

tion of the state courts*, and not subject to preemption?
A

Under Borden and Perko, Your Honor, as we

13

understand it, the test is what the crux of the action, is and

14

if the crux of the action ia the employment relationship, yes

15

the state court has jurisdiction.

IS
17
18

Q

What if it6s membership in the union? is that

exclusively Federal, in your view?
A

No, Your Honor»

If it’s solely and ex­

19

clusively membership in the union, that would be a matter over

20

which the state courts could exercise jurisdiction if it in­

which limits his employment opportunity.

II

Now, the union argues'that the remedy given him by

12

the state court cannot stand because he filed the wrong form of

i3

pleading.

14

for restoration of his union membership the case would have

15

been within the jurisdiction of the state court as an internal

16

union matter.

17

They say that if he filed a complaint asking only

His mistake, they say, was that he asked for damages

18

The Union thus seeks to make the question of

This, of course, would take us back,to the old

20

2

The critical act which gave rise to this case was

the■suspension of Respondent's membership in the union.

that act.

11

tion in which an individual is unlawfully arrested and detained

12

13

suit against the person responsible for the unlawful arrest

14

and he claims money damages for the loss of his employment.

15

The wrongful act on which such a suit is based is the false

16

arrest, and not the result of interference with his employment.

i?

He brings

If the false arrest had not taken place there would

S3

not have been any interference with his employment, or con­

19

sequent damages to him for loss of earnings.

20

So, in the present case, the wrongful conduct upon

21

which .his suit is based is the unlawful suspension from union

22

membership.

23

Without this there would be no cause of action.
The issue to which the Idaho Court addressed itself

24

wasthe propriety of the union's action in suspending Respondent

25

from membership and it carefully reviewed and followed the
21

1

decision of this Court in Gonzales in fashioning a remedy.

z

They pointed out -that under Idaho law a union constitution

o

constitutes a contract between the union and its members and

4

that the wrongful cancellation of Respondent's union member­

5

ship was a breach of contract for which the union is answerable

0

in the state court»

7

The trial judge stated in his memorandum opinions

8

and this is founa in Appendix 55; "I do not have jurisdiction

9

over his employer-employee relationship in. this action.

It is

10

my opinion that at most I can restore him to his union member­

11

ship as ©f the date of his wrongful termination.

12

attempting to follow Gonzales'as I see it.”

13

In this I am

The Idaho Supreme Court similarly concluded that the

14

trial court had authority to correct the breach of contract by

15

ordering Respondent restored to membership and that in line

16

with Gonzales * it had authority to fill out the remedy

17

awarding damages for his loss of earnings.

18

by

The Petitioners9 attempt to distinguish this case

19

from Gonzales is really an exercise in semantics.

The situa-

20

tionhere is in all respects: parallel to Gonzales.

In that case

21

the employee brought suit in the California court claiming to

22

have been wrongfully expelled from the union in violation of his

23

rights under the union constitution and he asked for damages

24

for the resulting loss of his employment.

25

The California Court entered judgment, ordering his
22

t

reinstatement and awarded damages for the lost earnings.

z

the case was reviewed by this Court the union presented the

3

same preemption argument that the Petitioner is nowadvancing.

4

They asserted that the resulting termination of Respondents

5

employment involved discrimination in violation of Section

S

8Cb){2) of the Taffc-Hartley Act and was therefore a matter

7

within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labor board.

8
9

When

This Court held that the National Labor Relations
Act does not undertake to ,protect union members as their

1©

rights ~ in their rights as members, from arbitrary conduct by

11

unions and union officers, and therefore the state court has

12

the power to grant the remedy, of reinstatement.

13

Q

Now, what were you citing there?

14

A

This is in Gonsales, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

15

Court held that the Labor Act does not undertake to protect

16

union members in their rights as members from aroitrary conduct

17

by the union officers, and the state court therefore had juris­

18

diction .

19

The Court went on to say that the state court had

2©

the power to fill out this remedy by an award of damages for

21

loss of images and suffering the damage from -this breach of

22

contract.

23

Taft-Hartley Act requires us to mutilate the comprehensive

24

relief of equity in such a situation."

25

It pointed out, and I quotes "No radiation of the

The facts in this ease are so closely akin to those
23

i

presented in Gonzales it is most difficult to see how this case

2[

could be decided in any other manner.

3

cases involve substantially different factual situations than,

4

the present case.

The Borden and Perko

One involved a hiring hall referral system under

5

6

which the union refused to refer a man for a job and the other

7

involved discharge of a foreman for assigning work to another

8

trade.

9

Neither of those cases involve wrongful suspension

10

of micm membership and neither affected the vitality of the

11

Gonzales decision.

12

it was not necessary in any event* for the Idaho

13

Supreme Court to rely exclusively on Gonzales in deciding the

14

question ©f state versus NLRB jurisdiction.

15

tli© pleadings the court could, have found that Respondent has

18

stated a proper cause of action under Section 301 of the Taft-

17

Hartley Act* which authorizes suits- for violation of collective

18

bargaining contracts between employees and unions.

19

On the basis of

It was clear from the facts alleged in the complaint

20

and found by.the court that Respondent's discharge from his

21

employment at a time when he was still • legally and rightfully

22

a member of the union was a breach of the existing collective

23

contract between the union and Greyhound.

24

25

This Court has held in a series of cases* including
Smith versus Evening News* 371 US* Humphrey versus Moore* in

24

1

375 USs and Vaea versus Sipes in 386 US* that an employee

2

discharged without cause may sue the employer or the union

3

under Section 301 in either‘or state courts* notwithstanding

4

that the discharge also involves an unfair labor practice

5

under the Taft-Hartley Act,
In the Evening News case an employee of a newspaper

6

7

brought suit in a Michigan court asserting discriminatory

8

action by his employer in violation of a collective bargaining

9

agreement.

The discrimination focused on employment during a

10

strike* allowing nonunion employees to report for work and pay­

31

ing them* even though there was no work available* bat denying

12

a similar privilege to the plaintiff.
The state court refused to entertain the suit*

13
14

15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24

25

holding that the discrimination was an unfair labor practice

within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB under the Garman
✓

rule.
This Court reversed* holding that the action arose
under Section 301 and was not preempted.

The Court said* and I

quotes "In Lucas Flour(?) as well as in Atkinson the Court
expressly refused to apply the preemption doctrine of the
Garman case and we likewise reject that doctrine here where the
alleged conduct of the employer not only arguably* but concededly is an unfair labor practice ttfithin the jurisdiction of
the Labor Board.

The authority of the board to deal with an

unfair labor practice which also violates a collective

25

i

bargaining agreement, is not displaced by Section 301 but it

2

is not exclusive and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the

3

Court in suits

under 301»”

4

In Vaea against Sipes, again this Court noted that

5

under this section, that is 301, the courts have jurisdiction

§

over suits to enforce collective bargaining agreements even

7

though ;the conduct of the employer which is challenged as a

8

breach of contract, is also arguably an unfair labor practice

9

within 'the jurisdiction of the labor board,

10

Q

Well, it 'is the theory of your brother,-Mr.
r

n

Groner, as I understood him that had that kind of a lawsuit

12

been brought in the state court the defendant could have re­

13

moved to the Federal Court? do you agree with that?

14

A

He could have, Mr» Justice Stewart, but he

15

could also have removed it as it was here»

There was sufficient

16

grounds for removal in the case as filed in the Idaho Court

17

under the pleadings as filed»

18

ship --

There was a diversity of citizen­

19

Q

There was a diversity?

20

A

Yes, sir? there was diversity»

21

Q

Well, I didn’t understand Mr» Groner to be

22
23
24
25

relying on diversity, but rather on Federal questions»
A

I say he could have removed on whatever

grounds was available and diversity was available to him»
Q

Well, do you think in the absence of diversity
26

I

of citizenship either a failure to represent complaint on the

z

one hand, or this sort of a complaint an the other, would

3

state a case that was removable to the Federal Courts by

4

Defendant in the absence of diversity?

5

A

I think it would be removable? yes? sir.

S

Q

Both of them?

7

A

But I think the failure to remove did not

8

prejudice the Petitioner here for the reason that Petitioner

9

had the opportunity to remove the case as it was.

10

Q

Yes, welly if it was removable?

11

A

Eight.

13

Mow f the union argues —

Q

This Petitioner also complained that he didn8

I am sorry?

16

Q

The Petitioner also complained that he didn9t

14

have the --

17

have a chance to argue the case before the NLRBy not just

13

the Federal Court.

19

A

WElly the Respondent here did not file a

20

charge with the labor board because his co-worker, Day, filed

21

a charge with the labor board and the labor board refused to

22

entertain it.

23

to file with -the labor board.

24
25

So it obviously would have been futile for him

Now, we don't know on what grounds the labor board
refused to take the case or to assume jurisdiction.
27

It might

1

very well be that the labor board viewed this as an internal,,

2

strictly an internal union matter,, which was within the state

3

court jurisdiction.

4

That left him with noplace to go.

5

And they just said, "We won't handle it."

Now, the Petitioners really can't complain that they

6

didn't have any opportunity to appear before the labor board

7

in this respect.

8

present whatever defenses were available to establish that

9

their conduct was not unlawful or improper or prejudicial, or

10

12

13

They had all of the opportunities here to

discriminatory —
Q

But do you agree that this is strictly a

matter between Lockridge and the union?
A

This is the — the source of this action , the

14

thing that caused the injury was his suspension from the union.

15

That is the first cause,

16

Q

In the language of Perko that was principally,

17

if not entirely on the union's action with respect to the

18

member's efforts to obtain employment.

19

Perko? is it not?

20
2!

A

That’s correct.

That’s the language of

Now, Perko did not involve

suspension from the union, now.

22

0

Well, 1 know, but —

23

A

Perko was never suspended from the union.

24

He simply couldn't get a job because the union put him on some

25

kind of a black list.
28

Q

1

WEI!? you had one of the bases for the

2

holding of this Court to where it is entirely- or at least

3

principally a matter between the man and the union, you first

4

go to the NLRB?

5

A

No s 1 bag your pardon? it is just -- I would,

6

say the reverse ? that where the principal point is between the

7

man and the union the labor board has no jurisdiction®

This

8

in Gonsales this Court held very clearly that the Congress

9

did not attempt to regulate the relationship between a member

1©

and his union in the Taft-Hartley Act®

They left that for the

states to regulate.
12

And tills is exactly the posture —

13

Q

.

Well, the language ~ do you dispute this

14

language that8s quoted here in the Government’s brief?

15

page 11 at the top of the page®

16

A

No? I don’t dispute that®

17

Q

That’s what I just quoted to you®

18

A

This was the distinction that,

On

This ~

I believe this

19

Court was making in Perko and Borden between Perko and Borden

20

on the one hand and Gonzales on the other®

21

dealt primarily with the employee’s, the member’s efforts to

Perko and Borden

22

obtain employment, whereas Consales involved his unlawful sus^

23

pension from the union? that is the internal union relationship

24

and the consequences ©£ that aofeg the consequences being his

25

loss of employment®
29

1

In other words, it's a two-step proposition»

The

2

first thing

3

then subsequently, or rather the consequence is he loses his

4

job.
Q

5
6

the union does is suspend him from membership and

Well, if the union gave him back his member­

ship, wouldn’t he have his job?

7

A

Yes, he would have.

8

Q

So the union is in it in the beginning and

9

at the end of it?

10

A

That’s correct.

11

Q

And the company’s not in it at all.

2

A

Well, he could have sued the company under

13

30 .

The company ~

5

Q

He sued the company and then dropped the

A

Yes, because ~ well, Your Honor, that was

16

7

before Smith versus Evening News.

8

this Court had not, at that point, developed quite clearly the

19

30

20

against the company.

2

concept.

That was back in

And that was the reason why he dropped

960 and

suit

But, today there is no question that he could sustain

22

a suit against the company under 30 .

23

Smith versus Evening News and Humphreyversus Moore and Vaca

24

versus Sipes and a whole series of other cases, that a man who

25

is improperly discharged may sue the•company or the union or

30

This Court has said in

1

both, alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement.

2

And he can maintain that suit in the state courts or the

3

Federal Courts, notwithstanding that the conduct complained of

4

is also an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Harfcley Act.

S

Q

Regardless of that, if the case gets to us

6

it's obviously an action of a complaint by an employee against

7

his own labor union, period.

There’s nothing more in it.

8

A

That’s -the w.ay this case is here; right.

9

Now, he can sue the union under 301; he doesn’t have

10

to join the employer and the complaint makes out the case for

U

jurisdiction under 301.

12
13

It alleges facts sufficient to

'support a breach of contract between the union and the company,
arid Greyhound.
Nowr in Humphrey versus Moore, the same question was

14
15

presented; the plaintiff in that case had alleged 301 as a

16

jurisdictional basis for his suit and the union then argued,

17

as the union argues here, that he didn’t, because he didn’t

18

specifically allege 301 he couldn’t raise it subsequently.

19

But this Court held that it was not necessary to specifically

20

allege 301, that if the complaint stated

Zl

wider 301, whether or not it involved an unfair labor practice

22

under the National Labor Relations Act, and said even if it. is

23

or arguably it may be an unfair labor practice.
The complaint here alleged that Moore’s discharge

was a

violation of the contract and was therefore within the
31

i

cognizance of state and Federal Courts, citing Smith versus

Now, the trial court here in this case, found that

4

there was —- that the discharge of Respondent was contrary to

s

the terns of the contract between Greyhound and the union.

6

That’s on page A-60 of the appendix.

7

a finding that there was a violation of the contract.

8

union had every opportunity to defend itself on that point, on

9

that question and they cannot now complain that they didn’t

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ISAAC N. GROWER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. GROWER?

Thank you, Mr. Kilculien.

Mr. Chief Justice and. may it please

the Court;

15

starts, yet I gather Idaho law is that he’s entitled to all the

IS

relief warraxited by the evidence.

19

And you asked, I gather, that the judgment
I notice, apparently while the plain­

Wow, would preemption reach the direction for full
restoration of union membership?
A

Yes, it would, for the reason that I will

20

come to, but we have alternative positions.

22

judgment, it leaves only that and strikes the —

Q

We say yes, it

I thought you conceded in vour argument in

wouldn't it?

4

A

3

If that was all there was to it? yes, Mr.

Justice Brennan.

6

Q

But when you asked for that in the state

7

court and also damages, then the state court had jurisdiction

8

as to both, remedies?
A

9

When

you have a claim which involves an

10

employment relationship and presumably when you mention the

11

word "damages," you are, I assume, referring to damages measured

12

by wages.

If they were measured by something else —

13

Q

This is damages for loss of earnings.

14

A

This is damages, in this case, measured

15

directly by wages without any question; yes.

16

would have no jurisdiction to reward that.

17

Then the court

And we say that the state court would have no juris-

18

diction in this case because under this Court's decisions in

Borden and Perko and under ~ but the fundamental thrusts, the

20

question at the outset, is whether the crux of the case invol­

Q

I know your time is limited, but why isn't

23

this to say the law of Idaho is that we disregard the pleadings

24

we look just at the evidence and the evidence indicates that

this is an action, among other things, for restoration of union

restoration of union membership.

Mr,, Justice Brennan? it is a question —

the employment relationship and not at the membership -A
