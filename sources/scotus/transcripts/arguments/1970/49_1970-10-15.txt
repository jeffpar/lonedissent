The Center for Democratic Studies u!'ld 1,: Mr. th.,tchj-,s

15

16

has recently proposed a new Constitution, which would divide tie

17

country into regions, which would give differ~n': powers to the

18

Supreme Court.

20

That would certainly change our i'o ..n of gcvern-

21

if he has unorthodox political views as to wi1c1t the form of

22

Judge Friendly dealt. with this point.

He said -ch"t

it was improper to inquire of an app ..icant ~s to uhether l'.e wa,;
:1.2

1

loyal, the proof of t~is, und~r-ying the form of. government.

2

He did not ex;>~ain why the same objectio·1 uould not apply to

3

a slightly shor~er fo:rmu.lation, that :i.t seems to me is .?.n indis
tinguishable formula.tion, of th-a for.i of gove~nme 1t of the. Ur,iBd

5

States.

Judge Motley in her dissen· rc.Jised th r very que:&t:1.0;:.

6

7

and as far as I know there is nothin • in uudg~ Fr:.endly's op:i.nior

8

which satisfactorily deals with this iss\le for •·he very re Lon

9

suggested by the Chief Justic~.
Now the state says t:hat Se :~io,i 9li06

constitutiona::. oath that

12

with mernb~rs of the Bar W:lo were jus. admitted, that they 11cul,l

14

what this says.

17

18
19

20

23
24

25

that is no~

In fact, it is not what it s;1icl.

what would be a constitutional lormu.ation.

Especially is t.nis

true in light of question 27, which ~rnplerrcnt3 this seuti0n, and
says, among other things, 'Cm you consci :iusly, and do

}'OU,

a.~f_r.r1

that you are, without any mental res rvation, loyal to and rea.l.y
to support !:he Constitution of the U1ited States?"
Now "without any mental re;ervat.ion" clause is certain}J

And then make it 'a qt,,.,s~ic,1
