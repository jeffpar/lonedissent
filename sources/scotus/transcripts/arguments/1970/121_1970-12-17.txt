ARGUMENT OF CURTIS R. REITZ, ESQ. *

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER

'

'

MR. REITZ:

10

Mr. Chief Justice* may it please the

11

Court.

I think it is fortuitous that the morning ends with a

12

case that involves a different

13

criminal contempt case, arising from Pennsylvania,, which is* in

kind of speech.

We have here a
i

14

my research* unprecedented in the law of criminal contempt.

We

IS

have a defendant who was on trial in 3966 under two very serious

16

charges for prison

17

of a prison breach* charges which had a potential of life

18

imprisonment under the second of those charges.

breach and for holding hostage in the course

The trial lasted twenty-two days, twenty-two trial

19
20

days.

It spreads from November 7 until December 22 on the

21

calendar.

22

two co-defendants were representing themselves on these very

23

serious charges.

24

jury verdict had been brought in, on the twenty-second day* the

25

trial judge opened the ne;xfc session of court on Monday morning

During those twenty-two days,

the defendant and

At the conclusion of the trial* after the

2

!

1

and excoriated all three defendants., summarily convicted them

2

of criminal contempt,, and held that as to eleven separate days,

3

although there were multiple incidents involved, that petitioner

4

Mayberry had been guilty of criminal contempt.

5

!

On each one of those eleven charges, as he recited

6

the facts as he recalled them, he imposed a sentence of a

7

minimum of one year and a maximum of two years in state prison.

3

After each one of those sentences, following the first, he
directed that each one of those sentences would be served con•
secutively.
.

10
1!

So that the first of his imposition of sentence was

12

a sentence in aggregation of eleven years at a minimum and

13

twenty-two years at a maximum for criminal contempt.

Clarify for me, if you will, Mr. Reits, the re­

lationship of these sentences col lectively to the sentence on

16

the substantive charge.

17

A

He then proceeded, Mr. Chief Justice, to sen­

18

tence on a substantive charge, and he gave a sentence for

1

prison breach of ten years, which was the maximum -- five years

20

minimum, ten years maximum, which was the maximum permitted by

21

the statutes of Pennsylvania for prison breach.

22

Q

Now, is that consecutive?

23

A

That was also consecutive.

He then imposed a

24

sentence of thirty years maximum, fifteen years minimum for the

25

charge of holding hostage.

The aggregate of all of that was

ARGUMENT OF CURTIS R. REIT?, ESQ. f

S

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER-- RESUMED

6

MR. REITZ:

May ifc please the Court» before we re­

7

cessed for lunch» we had explored a bit of the factual history

8

of this case and had begun some discussion of the seriousness

9

of the verbal conduct under which the trial judge in this case

10

n

sentenced the petitioner to so many years in jail.
I think it is fair to say that it is perfectly obvious

n

that the judge himself took a very serious view of the conduct

13

of petitioner; indeed the sentence alone indicates that he

14

viewed it as the most serious contempt case of all time.

15

verbal description both in the charge to the jury and in Ms

16

sentence of the petitioner and his co-defendants confirms that.

17

His

What adjective one might say is adequate to describe

18

the conduct» and I think that will depend on many points of

19

view» it is perfectly clear that the case was treated as a

20

very serious case and I would not urge the court that this con­

21

duct was either meritorious or even to be condoned.

22

What I do urge on the Court» and I think this is the

23

critical point, and it is underscored by whatever view of

24

seriousness one takes, the procedure employed in handling this

25

case was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the
8

1

crime, even if one views it as a rather petty crime.

a

The amount of procedural due process afforded to this
petitioner in handling this case was nil.
Q

Was it basically any different from the proced­

ural due process that he had in the trial of the substantive

charges?
A

7

Qh„ indeed. Your Honor.

On the substantive

charge, he had notice, he had the right to counsel, he had the

right to make preliminary motions, including a motion to dis­

qualify the judge.

He had insisted on the --

Q

More than that* he rejected* didncfc he?

16

A

He had indeed.

He insisted on his right to try

17

himself in that case, which is permitted under the Constitution.

18

But he was afforded the right to counsel.

19

to him and indeed, despite his waiver,

20

pointed the public defender to serve as an advisor to Mm dur­

21

available for resource.

the issue of mitigation of sentence.
9

The full panoply of a

1

trial was followed in the case of the substantive crime.

2

of it was followed in the contempt case.
Q

3

May I ask this* Mr. Reitg:

Hone

Is it your submis­

4

sion that the real vice here is the disproportion in terms of

5

procedure or disproportion in terms of penalty?
i

A

6

I think they go together,, Your Honor.

If the

7

sentence in this case had been in the tradition of sentences

a

for court re® decorum a rev/ days or a few dollars, as happened,

9

for example* in the Fisher vs. Pace case, that this Court re­

10

viewed many years ago, the amount of procedure that we tradi­

11

tionally have required in that kind of a case is rather slight.

12

And indeed if the judge does, as in the Fisher case, impose or

13

threaten to impose the sanctions during the course of the

14

trial* the procedural requisites follow from the necessary

15

situation.
In this case* we have an obviously much different

16

17

situation of a very serious crime in the mind of the judge, and

18

it seems to me the nature of the penalty quite reinforces the

19

total absence of any process.

There was no opportunity in this case to do many of

17

trial.

There were something in excess of 3,000 pages of steno­

18

graphic transcript in the trial.
In addition to the fundamental due process argument,

19
20

we make a separate argument which is in some ways even more

21

basic,, and that was the opportunity — petitioner was denied

22

the opportunity to make any statement in mitigation of punish­

ment in this case.
Q

there were indeed issues of provocation or explanation that

13

might in some way have tempered the fury.

14

this case, for example, attempted several times to introduce

apprehended.

as the statute is concerned* the sky is the limit.

and X have attempted to collect in the brief, a series of

benchmarks to which one could look for some sort of a ceiling

5

to be imposed from the outside on what a sentencing judge can

A

The constitutional provision on ‘which we rely on

14

cruel and unusual punishment.

15

That is the only one you think would be applic­

able so far as this Court's power to do anything about this

case?

10

A

1 believe so, Your Honor.

One might try t© make

19

a substantive due process argument* but 1 don't think that

20

gives us any greater prevision as to the limitations that one

21

could impose through the Constitution on state trial judges.

22

25

Q

I

Well* certainly* at least* we can't do what we

did in the Eighth in this case* can we?

You're quite right.

that the Court has exercised on numerous occasions in reducing

what it felt to be mild excesses by comparison on the part of

federal trial judges.

of the instant case, in terms of the action, I am speaking of

establishing standards -- shouldn’t they be established in the

state courts in the first instance?

There is great virtue to that in some instances,

Mr. Reitz, didn't Justice O'Brien assume in his

Pennsylvania to examine the sentence for contempt?

Well, Justice O'Brien relies on the cruel and

He is persuaded that in comparison

xvith the statutory maximum for a whole raft of offenses, includ­

?3

ing second degree murder, being less than the sentence imposed

19

on this defendant for conduct which bears no resemblance to

20

the atrocious assaults and homicides, that bear a lesser

Yes, indeed. Your Honor, I think we would.

13

A

Two years on each, and that is still twice as

Yea, but --

They were insulanfc and discourteous, but they

were not in any way blocking the advance of the trial.

But it is treated as contempt.

Suppose it is

just treated as any other crime, where you want to punish a

man for doing something seriously wrong, they should fix his

Well, X suppose the legislative judgment is to

You do have a statute in Pennsylvania, it

In light of the DeStefano case. Your Honor, I

I do not think that is the right

I do not subscribe to that.

There was, of

think it would be futile to make that argument now.

11

the line has to be drawn at a very low level, at the point

where the number of days — and I would think it is number ©f

the ambit of where contempt is traditionally a line of dis­

cipline of lawyers.

25

It seems to me that at least one can say that sis?

But it seems to me that it is

those cases the remedies are, as the appendix and our brief

that a judge can impose that Rind of sanction and 1 would not

There are many de­

This is not the only deterrent.

contempt was specifically reserved in Justice Black's opinion?
A

The power to cite for contempt, not the power

21

to impose a contempt sentence, and I think, as Justice Black's

22

opinion makes clear, that citation is a notice which requires

23

a subsequent trial, a trial at which the defendant, as Justice

24

Black noted, could again be disorderly.

ARGUMENT OF CAROL MARY LOS, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MISS LOS;

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

12

Court.

Me were originally of the opinion that the entire

13

trial transcription should be printed in the appendix for the

14

Court because we felt that only by reading the entire transcript

15

could this Court get some idea of the feelings and the tensions

16

and the pressures that existed throughout this long five-week

17

trial.

18

realised that by the court stenographer merely taking down the

19

words that happened, that so much missed the court stenographer

20

or could not be taken down simply in the method of words that

21

this Court could not feel simply from a cold record the

22

tensions and the pressures that existed that day, or the

23

response that the petitioner was able to evoke, not only from

24

his co-defendants or from the jury, but from the spectators

25

who were in the'court room at the time.

Unfortunately, going through the trial transcript, we

me that the petitioner might be able to take advantage of this

cold record and deny first of all that he is extremely infcelll-

4

ring leader but the instigator of all of these contempts.

What happened precisely was this:

Q

0

Do you find any basis in anything you have dis­

10

covered in the eases for saying that a judge chooses not to

11

exercise his contempt power when episodes in the court room

12

occur but to postpone the whole thing until after the trial*

13

that what he is dealing with in the absence of a state statute

14

is a single offense?
A

15

Mo* Your Honor.

The reason why I feel here that

16

this was not just one continuing offense, these were separate

17

offenses —

18

Q

I understand that is the way they were treated.

19

A

Yes.

20

Q

But they were not dealt with at the time by the

21

judge during the course of the trial, perhaps for a very good

22

reason.

23

A

First of all, the sentencing was not given out

24

until the end of the trial.

The petitioner and his co-defendants

25

were warned repeatedly by the trial judge.
37

In fact, at on©

*

point judge called counsel before him and expressly asked

2

counsel to go through the possibilities of contempt and the

3

actions of their client, because he felt that they should be

4

well aware that their actions were contemptuous.

*

S

Now, the fact that he waited until the end of the

6

trial I think was done solely to protect the petitioner and his

7

co-defendants, so that the petitioner wouldn't become, first of

8

all, so enflamed and so enraged that he would stop the trial by

8

means of letting the jury know, and getting so out of hand that

10

the trial couldn’t continue.
I think that' since his purpose here was to protect

11
12

the petitioner, and certainly to protect the Commonwealth's

13

right to see the case through to its just end, that the peti­

24

tioner cannot now say, well, the judge couldn't do at the end of

15

trial what he could do in the middle of the trial.
Q

26

Miss Los, assuming that some people would con­

17

sider these violent verbal attacks as assaults, if he were

28

charged with that he would have gotten his jury, wouldn't he?

sentence for second-degree murder in Pennsylvania?
A

Yes, ten to twenty years, Your Honor, yes, for

second degree.
Q

And this man has 22.
38

1

A

Your Honor, we're talking here about an affront-

2

ery to public justice and not to one individual.

3

about a man disrupting the orderly administration of justice,

4

affronting the dignity and order in the court -Q

5

6

Ws!re talking

You're talking about the judge trying him after

the man called him a stumbling old dog or something.
A

7

That is true, but I fully believe that the judge

8

understood that Mayberry's purpose in doing this was not direct­

9

ed toward him as such but only because Mayberry's chief purpose

10

was to stop the trial.

1?

Q

12

How in the world could he know that and how in

the world do you know that he knew that?

13

A

I believe he knew that. Your Honor.

'14

Q

Well, we believe it.

15

A

For these reasons:

1 agree with that.
First of all, as I say,

16

Mayberry had threatened several times and boasted that the trial

17

would never reach its completion.

Secondly, he --

18

Q

But that is not in this record, right?

19

A

Because it was not part of testimony, Your Honor.

20

Q

Well, we deal with what we have before us, don't

22

A

Right, and that is why I am asking you —

23

Q

I am not for a moment not agreeing that you're

21

we?

24

telling the truth, but I mean the point is that we have got a

25

record here.
39

1

A

And that is why 1 respectfully ask that if you

2

feel this is cruel and unusual punishment,, that you remand it

a

for hearing so that all the facts can foe put before the court

4

because as the record stands, it is a very co3d record and as

5

excerpted it appears as if Mayberry might have been justified

6

for some of the comments that he made.

7

torts what actually happened in the trial that this Court can­

a

not make a determination as to whether or not that was actually

3

cruel and unusual punishment without a complete hearing on what

10

11

1 think that it so dis­

actually occurred„
Q

When you talk about a complete hearing, ave you

12

suggesting a complete hearing in a due process sense of a trial

13

before a jury or before another judge?

14

A

1l

No, 1 am not, Your Honor, because I still believe

15

that 1966 standards must apply and as such in 1S66 Pennsylvania

IS

law, the interpretations by the state of Pennsylvania relying

17

on In Re Oliver were that a judge could sentence summarily with­

18

out due process safeguards that are now essential, for example

19

in a serious crime, and we will concede that 22 years is a

20

serious offense*

21

Q

Did you have any idea that this man had been in­

22

dicted by a jury, appointed lawyer for him, given him a full

23

trial like, anybody else gets who is charged with a crime, that

24

there would have been any difficulty of getting him convicted?

25

A

Absolutely none, Your Honor.
40

1

Q

In a fair and impartial trial?

a

A

Absolutely no difficulty.

3
4

5
6

I think absolutely he

would be convicted.
Q

He would have had a chance then to get an unbias­

ed judge and an unbiased jury?
A

Thatmay

very well be true, Your Honor,, but I

7

don’t think that vitiates the proceeding that we had here.

8

think the judge did have an absolute right to sentence, as he

9

did summarily --

10

Q

Suppose he had sentenced him to life?

11

A

1 think he had the right under the

I

absent

12

cruel and unusual punishment, absence that argument, I think he

13

absolutely had the right to do that.

14

Q

Well, 1 agree with you as to the seriousness of

15

the crime fully.

16

about punishment for 22 years for trying to disturb and destroy

17

the possibility of a court proceeding.

18

worried about in the case is that the judge tried him without

19

his having that which a man charged with a serious crime ought

20

to have, and that is a trial by an impartial judge and accord­

21

ing to due process.

22

A

I have no doubt about that.

I don’t worry

Your Honor.

solution, is the ease going to be tried under 1966 standards or
1971 standards?

11

A

I think it only fair that if we are going to

12

judge what a trial judge did in 1966 under those standards,

13

that he do it in terms -- that the hearing be done in terms of

14

what was the lav; in Pennsylvania at that time.

Thank you.
