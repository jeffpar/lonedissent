We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice .and may it please

the Court;
This is an appeal from the dismissal of a
complaint of three individual taxpayers and several organiza­
tions, challenging the constitutionality, with a Pennsylvania
statute; Act 109, which provides for the payment of tax money
to nonpublic schools, to reimburse them for the costs of
teaching mathematics, modern foreign languages, physical
science and physical education.
The complaint alleged a violation of the First
Amendment's religious clause and of the Equal Protection Clausa
of the 14th Amendment.

A three-judge court dismissed the com­

plaint on the First Amendment grounds on the basis of a failure
to state a cause of actions no answer, no discovery, no ferial,
no record^ and the 14th Amendment ground for a.lack of standing
in i all parties.
When this act was passed it was without precedent
in the United States.

Its scheme is simply this; any public
3

1

school has a month to fill out a form — excuse m® — any

2

nonpublic school has but to fill out a form and submit it,

3

setting forth its costs in these subjects, the teachers®

4

salaries, teaching materials and for textbooks and the state

5

forthwith pays that amount over to the school.

6

action is labeleds Purchase of Services Contract.

The trans­

As Judge Hasty, dissenting below, said, neverthe­

7
8

less, and I quotes "The Stats buys no services andthe school

9

sells none." There are no new children involved? there is no

10

new teaching.

11

precisely the same as it was before the act?the only difference

12

is economic.
The act provides for considerable new state

regulations of the schools, the nonpublic schools, and when I
say "nonpublic" it's to be understood, of course, that these
are largely church-affiliated schools? 97 percent.

The pedagogical status quo in Pennsylvania is

does it?

1

No, sir, for any procedures and for

regulating of teaching content and those provisions of the act

The first year it was five and that8s in the

record, but since then 17 and a half million,,

Now, the complaint alleged particular violations

of the establishment and freedom of exercise clause, although

there is no question raised about its adequacy as a pleading — j

I know you said
Does the state

authority accept the representation from the institution?
A

They make out a form, Your Honor,that says

that the cost for teachers3 salaries and teacher materials and
textbooks is such and such, for teaching, let's say, mathe­
matics, and then they submit that to the state and the 'state
pays them the money»
Q

Well, is there any order topay —

A

Oh, yes? there is an order»

There is an

order of whether or not they —
Q

Well, before the money is paid what check

is made of it?
A

Q

I see.

Honor»

A

!

We can "only glean 'this from the statute ,
¥

2

because there is no record.

So we never found out how the

3

state goes about these procedures.

4

appeal is that there should have been a -- although I’m here,

5

an appeal from a mctioxx to dismiss, and I would b® unable to

It wasn’t a summary judgment! was it?

No, sir.

It’s not an Allen situation where

both sides cross-moved for summary judgment after — and it
wouldn’t have happened in this case except the complaint was
filed in a complaint for dismissal, almost.

Now, the first year it was only $200 million so

In legislative

appropriations ?

It was from hors® racing-—

A horse-racing tax.

Yes# that5s right»

6

The 17 and a . half and if I understand the schedule — Mr,

7

Shane Creamer can tell us — I understand it will go to $38

8

million in the forthcoming year# although on -'Sunday night at

9

midnight the State of Pennsylvania officially went bankrupt#

11

probably in limbo,

And so all of these bills are

This case hasn't become moot as a result

No, sir —

assessment bill, and after 200 years the Pennsylvania Assembly
attempts what the Virginia Assembly attempted and which Madison
and Jefferson defeated.
Q

The similarities exe striking.

All you are really asking us for is that

you have a chance to try this case? isn't it?
A

Yes# sir# but you could facially declare

this constitutional and I do want to address myself to that.
There are several grounds on which this Court could find —
we must be realistic about it? it presents problems on many
7

I

levels.

2

Thera is no question that the traditional church-state docu­

3

ments avowed by this Court would appear to require the invali­

4

dation of this act,

They are at the legal level! the traditional level,

I discern eight grounds on which church-state

5
6

cases have been ~ by this Court and I venture, to say this is

7

the first piece of legislation ever before this Court that

8

violates school aid and I will come to that in a moment

,

Q

9

sirs,

Could I ask you a preliminary question?

10

Is it of any consequence that the general taxing power of the

11

state or the general revenue of the state are not involved here?

12

this is a special tax derived from horse racing?
A

13

The Court below thought not.

That question

14

was raised as tax money and one of my claimants went to the

15

horse race and paid the tax and he was the only one found to

16

have an issue (?) and I think the Court's wrong on that,

17

is a tax and public money is public moneys for this purpose.

18

There might be other cases where you have a great deal of

19

question of what the source is.
But when you gat to the fundamentals of the First

20
21

Amendment» Mr. Justice Harlan» I think public money is public

22

money.

23

you can't isolate it.

24
25

A tax

And it makes no difference whether it's a special tax?

The controversy here is pregnant with, other issues.
As they say in their brief and as. they said in Harrisburg,
8

!

that unless relief — unless subsidy is forthcoming the

2

parochial school system will wither and decline *

3

handy the attackers of the bill will point out at a different

4

level that the effect of this would be to perpetuate de facto

S

racial degregafcion that's exemplified by the nonpublic school

6

system; or at still another level the proponents say, having

7

predicted the demisa of the nonpublic school system that the

S

resulting exclusively public system will be deleterious to

9

a — society and wo would r-;; I 'suppose*that what you are

/

On the other

10

heading for here is a cteal school system,

11

sustained: the'ohe primarily affluent and suburban and white

12

and at least typically white suburban audit leads to the other

13

poor* inferior, practically custodial and Black.
And there are nations that have dual school

14

15

systems and this is what we are heading for.
If we are talking about the traditional document,

this act is

there is no precedent for it — there is no precedent for
legislation.

The cases are discussed; they lead, it seems t©

me to the conclusion that unless the law is to be changed the
establishment (?) must go down.
I do want to mention Bradfield, however, since it
has come up, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Now, Bradfield has a
I'm not speaking about the

situation in Bradfield, because I will talk about that, too.
As a precedent, I think Bradfield doesn9t need to trouble us,
9

1

because, rightly or wrongly — 1 have a footnote which covers

2

Brad fie Id in rny brief at some length at page 19=

3

the Supreme Court*- rightly or wrongly* just ididn't reach the

4

'First Amendment issue because they simply said;
— the hospital corporation5s

And there,

the fact that

5

this corporation

-members are

6

composed of religious people and they happen to be Catholics*

7

doesn’t make it sectarian any more than if would if they were

8

Methodists and they concluded finally* "We are not able to

9

say*" and I'm quoting: we are not able to say that the complair t

10

in this bill shows that the corporation is of -the kind des­

1!

cribed.

On the contrary he has clearly shown it is not.
Now* that doesn't get us away from the question.

12
13

The question is: how about hospitals* because hospitals are in

14

a relationship with the state and that's true in Pennsylvania

15

today»

They are paid so much per diem for indigent patients

collected by the state and sent to them for treatment.
Q

Weir* don't 'they receive direct Federal

grants under Hill-Burton?
A

Yes* sir* but not if they are sectarian.

Q

Pardon?

A

Not if they are sectarian.

That's my

undearstanding and here again* we are without a record.
Your Honors asked me.

So*

I was on the board of an Episcopal

Hospital in Philadelphia and we added nonEpiscopalians to the
board? we did a number of things of that kind.
*

1G

We detached

1

ourselves from the archdiocese in order to get Hil-l^Burton

2

funds»
Now, 1 think that's what happens in hospital

caseso

5

analogous to our situation? that iss you treat a patient and

6

you get paid so much»

7

differences and

8

the hospital situation to prevail constitutionally.

9

am speaking of the kind of thing that might foe

My rationale is this, and -these are the

think they probably all have to exist for

First of all? to recognise that it is not a

10

church and that care of- the sick is not a mandated — now?

11

mandated where they just function? it’s part of the good will

12

ethics of almost all religions.

f. doesn't? therefore? teach or prosefcylize.
t does not prefer —

don't think exclusion is necessary *—

think any, distinct preference is sufficient to make it un­
constitutional and finally? and most important2 this is true
purchase of services.

Here the purchase of services is not a

subterfuge? here the status quo is not the same after as before .
because new specific individuals who are discernable and could
be tracked or treated would not be treated if it were not for
the use of this facility.
So?

think that all those differences are

important to the situation and
if’Mr...Pfeffer did —

don't for one minute agree?

'm not quite sure he did — that the

state can subsidize a church to carry on a secular function.

11

%

I think it sen only do that under very special circumstances

2

and the hospital one is one of the very few that I can

3

imagine.
Q

4

Mr. Sawyer, you seem to distinguish the

5

hospital situation even though it maintains a chaplaincy'

6

staff*, for instance?
A

7

Yes o

1 -chink the mere maintenance -- all

8

of these other qualifications, the mere maintenance of a chape.'

9

somewhere on the premises would not be sufficient, but I think,

10

as somebody said, I don't think you can be made to go through

11

the chapel either on your way to be cured or in thanks for

12

having been cured on your way out.
Q

13

Well, what about what I was mentioning,

14

a chaplaincy staffs four or five chaplains of a particular

15

denomination maintained by the hospital? does this make a

16

difference?
A

17

Your Honor, I think you keep adding things

18

and 1 think you will finally we get to the point.

19

would say no? not if there is not an importuning of the chari­

20

table patients in any way.
I would say no.

21

i
j

By itself I

The mere availability of the staff,

But 1 think you could keep adding until it

22

begins to be a permeation of the jury function with a religious

23

function.
Now, I do want to mention Allan because the

24

briefs in Allen — all the briefs in Allen misstate Allen's

23

12
I

!

facts , and I must say that — 1 have to say ‘that that mis­

2

statement .is based on a misapprehension, I think, of

3

facts in the Wals opinion»

4

Mien's

X5m referring to the — and it's alleged that the

5

Court in Allen sustained a New York book law even though the

6

effect was to relieve the schools of, Walz said,

7

cost for those books»"

8
9

"the enormous

Now, actually the footnote in the Allen case,
Footnote six, makes it clear that the parents previously bought

10

the books; not the schools, so that there was no relieving of

1?

the burden that the school previously carried»

12

Now, there is another point in Allen, a factual

13

point, that I haven't seen commented on at all and that is this;

14

that prior to the 1965 amendment in New York the State didn't

15

pay for public school children's books; they could be paid for

16

by special provisions, 703 of the local, tax»

17

means that there the New York Legislature was conferring a

18

benefit; namely, free books on all children that had not pre­

19

viously existed.

20

footnote in the Allen case in the very beginning of Justice

21

White8s opinion.

22
23
24
25

But, you see that

It's quite clear; you will see that in ’the

Now, before 1965, and I am quoting from the
second paragraph;

"The State purchased books and so and so, to

rent or sell the books to the public school children»"

Now,

the prearable there that they were doing something for education
13

i

took on some plausibility and it was applying to all children

2

something they didn’t have before and indeed, could this Court, [

3

have said in Allen that the Mew York statute was unconstitu­

4

tional unless, in the process of giving books to all children,

5

the Mew York. Legislature said,

-

6

"But, Catholic children can’t

have them.''
Now, the analogy in Pennsylvania, you see, 'would

7

4

8
9
10

11
12

13
14
15

be if Pennsylvania, in order to fulfill a lack of teaching in
mathematics or physical sciences, et cetera ~ a lack of teach­
ing, had set up somewhere, either tutoring or some facility
to teach these four subjects.

And then they would have that

kind of situation and then when we come in and say:

"Well, the

Pennsylvania Act is unconstitutional because it doesn't ex­
clude Catholic children from these facilities."

But, of

course, nothing like that happened.
Now, in that sense, Allen, it seems to me,—

16

Q

What if, haying

a

shortage of mathematics

17
18
19

teachers, the State had set up a center to teach teachers in
these subjects, including the sisters of Roman Catholic orders?
A

Teach them free?

20

Q

With tax money; to —

21

A

That’s a hypothetical situation, Your Honor»

22
that I would think would be constitutional.

Xfyju could offer

23
free education to anybody, even if the free educationas to how
24

Vi

to educate in Catholic schools; ves, sir.
25

14

Q

I

With this hypothetical and while you are

2

stopped* let me ask you another.

3

Education of the State provided panels of public school

4

teachers* hired on public school standards to teach all

5

nonsectarian subjects and provided by the act that any private

6

school meeting certain other scholastic standards ©f law could

7

have one of these teachers to teach mathematics or chemistry

8

ill their school under the direction of the state.
Do you see an involvement there?
A

10

12
13
14

17

IS

it’s difficult.

23
24
25

There is entanglement and an involvement in

problems.
That is* I really am not trying to evade it; I've
thought about it and I’m not at all sure* Your Honor* how I
could brief that question to this Court.

I think it's a very*

I

very close case.

20

22

•

I don't know how this Court would resolve that problem; I think

19

21

I see a lot of problems with that kind of

legislation* Your Honor and of course* it’s been talked about.

15
16

"these

9

n

Suppose the Board of Public

Q

It isn’t our case* anyway.

Q

It would be the same way with a voucher

A

Yes* air; the voucher grant* I think

grant.

presents problems* but there I think I could say with confidence
that the constitutional magnitude of the problems of the voucher
plan are fairly insignificant compared to this
15

Pennsylvania.

situation»

1

2

.

Now, I want to mention just this about Walz;

3

Walz certainly made one important purely negative point»

4

Quit® clearly Walz refused to validate the exemption there on

5

the ground that churches, by good works, by welfare and chari­

6

table works, perform a secular function which otherwise would

7

have to be performed at public "expense.

8
9

Our Chief Justice

who announced this

opinion for the court clearly announced that rationale.

That

10

seems to rae to pretty well jeopardize the argument of the

11

Appellees that the main reason that this is constitutional is

12

because this is a secular function and that the facts — before

13
H

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

my church, makes no difference.
The rather critical thing is the concept in Walz
of both interdependence and entanglement.
somewhat differant.

I think they are

.Here, interdependence is, on the face of

this act, the legislature has said;

"We are now dependent on

the church school system to carry out our mandated constitution­
al duty to educate children."
And in the brief filed here the church has now
said; "We are dependent upon the state subsidy to carry on our
church-mandated function of educating adherents to our faith."
As to entanglement, and I think the very core of
Walz was entanglement, because it seems quite clear that ^he
concern of the Court that taxation would mQan more entanglement

25

IS

1
2

than exemptionC?)
As to entanglement, -this act: has a great deal of

3

it, far more than I think any of the other legislation involved

4

in this series of cases; not only these inspections of these

5

teacher grades and all those new rules, but very, very impor­

6

tant is Section 3, Act 109 — and I quote; "Any subject matter

7

expressly religious teaching or the morals or forms of worship

8

of any sect81, to enter into the teaching of these subjects»

9

Now,, does this not require a state to conduct a

10

very continuing surveillance, to use the Chief Justice's words,

11

which the Chief Justice said but a hallmark of entanglement,

'12

impermissible entanglement.

'13
'14

15
'!6
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

Now, we don't share that there is going to be a
wholesale invasion of this by, let's say, the Catholic schools.
But, we do say that ites only a part of separatism to insist
on the immutable secular!ty of any subject, .particularly,
something"like-physical science.

I mean, after all, it was

astronctay, not -theology which got Gallileo in trouble.

Well, 1 think, Your Honor — I really

10

and fascinatingly enough, every single one can be found in the

11

the — not one single one of the tests of the Court's rules

12

that I do not find somewhere in the language of that document.

13

But, as to the purpose, the District Court simply

14

15
18
17
18
19
20

said — it refused to look"',at the legislative history,, and
this of course, is the official legislative history,

.because

Pennsylvania takes it all, apparently on the mistaken notion
that I was trying to get them to examine the modus of the
legislators.

Well, I wasn't talking about the modus; I was

talking about the committee, reports and the — the significance
is this;

the Appellees say the purpose here is to provide

2?

children in the State of Pennsylvania with instruction in at

22

least four subjects, as the preamble said.

23

But when you look at the legislative history you
will find that nobody every suggested that there, was any such

If that had been researched the Committee would have explored

question, and that is whether or not the supposed exigencies,

12

And you are asked to do this, by the way, without

13

a record»

14

Now, there is a contention of fact made here, and

that is that if the aid isn't forthcoming this school system

15

will wither and-die, I would think is relevant; it is relevant

16

and must be .pleaded; it must ba proved that I ha entitled

And of course I know of no

institution in our society except perhaps the military , that

there is no finding in the sense that so many schools —

Q

Suppose it is true; suppose the record

7

showed conclusively that this was true; how does that bear on

8

the constitutional question, in your view?

9

A

In my view, Your Honor, it doesn’t. bear at

10

all and there no practice that says if something is more ex­

11

pensive to be done constitutionally, that that’s a ground for

12

doing it unconstitutionally.,

13

But,

you

cannot be unaware, Your Honor.—

14

There is a mass of matter in these briefs -— that this issue

15

has certainly not treated itself very much — in this case and
it is raised by the Appellees in the brief of this Court. And !

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

it’s there; and they say it’s there.

I’m skeptical that there

has been a grievance there and I would like to have discovery
on the facts to restore a vast principle of constitutional law
that has to be decided by this Court on the supposition that
there is this kind of practical problem, and to speak very
freely it has been raised by a church where the treatment would
show that the capital assets of the church vastly exceed that
of every other denomination in the United States combined, and
I don’t, for one, believe that because of financial difficulty
21

I

that the Catholic Church is going to give up a mandated

2

function for which they fought, and indeed in Philadelphia in

3

1941, died for a principle in the condition of affluence in

4

which everyone in society now finds themselves,
Now, I must get, if I may, to the 14th .Amendment»

B
6

Leupp(?), there the Court said no standing in any of my plaints.

7

The charge was that the nonpublie schools are d@ facto racially

8

segregated, whether by reason of policy or tradition or prac­

9

tice or cost or residential pattern, that they are.

Basically

to

it is a white school system.

The figures that are available

1!

from public sources are in the brief,* again we have no record.
The complaint idea is this: that with this amount ..

12

13

of tax money going to these schools they are sufficiently

14

quasi public so that if they discriminate and segregate that

15

is state action reachable by the Equal Protection Clause of the

16

14th Amendment.

17
18

As for standing, I think it8s a case where, to
who
find out whether or not Mr. Lemon/is a Negro parent with Negro

19

children in the public school and who alleges in his complaint

20

a deleterious effect upon his children’s schools bytreason- of

21

a subsidy to the others.

Whether he has a sufficient personal

22

stake in the outcome, which has been the touchstone of standing

23

in these matters -- he is a taxpayer —* would be illuminated

24

by discovery.

25

I think the two are interchangeable because it may
22

t

j

!

depend, indeed, on how pervasive the segregation is and how

2

much discrimination there is and we can't find out any of thatj

3

without discovery in the matter.
Kowf I mentioned that — well, one point more on

4

j
!

S

the 14th Amendment point.

Mr. Douglas said not so long ago

6

in Jones against Mayer (?) — he said; "The contrivances which

7

some states have concocted to abort, the command of our decision

8

in Brown versus Board of Education are by now legendary."

!

Now, I for on®, can't for

9

the life of me see how,

10

if you validate a purchase of services contract scheme where,

11

in fact, no new educational

12

merely a method of channeling funds, how that device is not

13
14

going to be available to the formerly de jure states still
resisting Brown v. Board of Education.
Maybe possible to cut it; Ir for one, would think

15
16

difficult.
Now, I said in the beginning that 1 thought there

17

18
19
20
21

22

were eight tests used by the Court and that this act violated
all of them.

25

Just in a sentence, first of all the general flat

principle; no tax money to churches coming down from — a
remonstrance right straight through the language of many, many
of these cases, and that’s on the face of the act.
Than the primary purpose if that's, one, and;primary

23
24

benefit is being conferred? it's

effect.

The primary purpose, it seems clear from the-legis­

lative history; the primary effect we do need to discover.
23

I

I

thiftk one can discern that there is some primary effect.
Then the concept of sponsorship, which is in

2
3

McCollum? it was certainly in Engle.

Mr. Justice Brennan

4

distinguished the Zorach and Clauson situation from the

5

McCollum situation on that basis.

6

the state must not sponsor or even appear to sponsor a

7

religion, which is one of the points of Schempp.

It was in Schempp; that is

Then preference, the fact that this act manifestly

8
9

prefers one religion over all others and prefers at very most,

10

two or three religions over all others and affirmatively dis­

11

criminates against those religions too poor, too scattered, to

12

even think about running a school system: Black store front

13

mission types of churches, for instance.
Then, interdependence, and that's on the basis of

14
15

the act because the act says it's dependent.
Entanglement, and that's shown by Section 3,

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM B. BALL, ESC.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

21

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

22

MR, BALL;

23
24
25

Mr. Ball.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I'm speaking here today for seven Catholic,
26

1

Protestant and Jewish named defendant schools who are the

2

Appellees in this case»
I think, Mr. Chief Justice, I should begin by

3
4

trying to clear up a point which hangs over the case at this

5

moment — a preliminary point, which relates tothe question of

S

whether the court below improperly denied discovery in trial to

7

the Appellants.
It is our contention that what the Appellants have

S

brought to -this Court today. Your Honor, is an attack limited

10

to the facial constitutionality of this act.

11

recited that they attack the act both on its face and as appliei

12

Now, let me come to 'the "applied" constitutional.it:'

Their complaint

13

point for a moment.

14

they attack, they sue these seven schools as respresehtafcive of

IS

all sectarian institutions in the Commonwealth, 'the defendant

16

class action.

17

Their complaint in paragraph 7 says that

We than brought a motion under Rule 23(c) to test

this application.

19

process to the seven schools which have a great deal of varia­

20

tion among themselves, foi- all the remaining 1174 schools in the

2!

WE wanted, in other words, to afford due

Commonwealth which are under contract, and finally, even to the

22

plaintiffs so that they would have an opportunity to come in

23

and prove classes and subclasses and whether one or more or

24

any of these schools belong to any of these particular classes.

25

Now, the plaintiffs at this point, withdrew that-

27

j

?

class action»

They filed an answer which is confined to the

z

appendix, A-42«

3

maintained as .a class action under Rule 23(c)»

4

lowed promptly by the pretrial order of the lower court, which

5

said? "The action shall not be maintained as a class action»"

Plaintiff agrees that the action will not be

This was fol­

Therefore, the issue of representativeness of thes3

7

schools went out of the case.

This is the first wing of their

8

application attack»

9

Coming to their second wing: did they

to just the seven? ■

10

The lower court asked that all parties submit a

11
12

memorandum on the propriety of convening a three-ju€ge court.

13

Did the plaintiffs want a three-judge court or not?

14

insisted upon a three-judge court and in their memorandum,

■

They

thinking now of whether they attacked the application of this

15

act to these seven schools.

16

In their memorandum of the propriety of a three-

17
judge court

18

A-60 in the Appendix, they said: "Certainly it

wouldbe a strained misreading of the complaint to in any way

19

construe it as limited to a particular branch, to a particular

20

school or class of schools or to anything less than an attack

21

on the entire statutory scheme."

22

And my friend here, on oral argument, nailed this

23

down if it weren't nailed down sufficiently, by saying A-6£ in

24

the record: "I am not saying, and I think 1 have made this

25

I

\4

clear, that this act is only unconstitutional as to these

a

defendant schools; I an talking about its being uncon®titufciona

3

in its entire purpose, thrust and effect in 67 counties in the

4

State of Pennsylvania,"
I think -therefore we have to face the question of

5
6

what is left in this case, plainly an attack of the facial

7

constitutionality of the act and in that event, what would be

8

uncovered by the discovery and trial by which the plaintiffs

©

so eagerly seeks?
Well, let's asks that tax money is involved?

10

It's

1!

on the face of the act? the act calls for the expenditures of

12

tax' funds.

13

the act calls .for payments to be made to sectarian institutions

14

The act defines a nonpublic school, the payee in this act, a

15

nonpublic school as any school in which the requirements of the

16

17
18

The payments are made to sectarian institutions;

compulsory attendance lav; may be met,
includes sectarian schools.

“Any school" plainly

That sectarian schools have sec­

tarian purposes, would this be brought out upon discovery at

19

trial?

20

Court stated in Board of Education versus Allen that parochial,

21
22

23
24
25

This Court has taken judicial notice of this; this

religious, sectaz'ian schools, church-related schools, serve two
goals: secular and sectarian; therefore there would

oe nothing

to be discovered upon trial with respect to that; or that a
high percentage of the nonpublic schools in Pennsylvania are
under Catholic auspices.

Indeed, the Court must bs deemed to
29

i

have known that in Allen»

This is indeed a fact of which this

2

Court can take judicial notice»
That the 'seven schools Mend sectarian and

3
4

secular instruction or if they do, and they may, but if they

5

do, this is in violation 'of-the plain terms of the act, as

6

contained in Section 3, Subsection 3, which provides that; "In,

court was right, .or wrong- in its estimation of whether this act

But, if the lower

17

within propriety but mandated to grant our motion under Rule

The first payment under this act is not made by the

pays for certain services rendered in four subjects, four prims,

"When the state has ascertained .that the

school has paid for such instruction?" what does that mean?
A

That means that the schools will have

presented to the State, Your Honor, a claim containing three

elements of costs state-approved textbooks — by the way, -these

are not. textbooks that the school submits to the state? they

instruction materials in the four subjects, and finally that

13

part of a teacher6s salary which is allocable to the teaching

14

of math or modern foreign languages or physical science or

That means that the state uses the proce­

audits the accounts that relates to these three items of ex­
pense.

that there can be no secular instruction in a sectarian school

Q

Your Honor.
The; payment that is made is the payment that is
made to reimburse an actual cost after that cost has been en­
countered; has been encountered in the performance of the sec­
ular function; it has been encountered in the performanceof the
secular function which is evidently needed to be performed in
38
J

1

Pennsylvania, and which does not depend, by the way, upon

2

whether, in answer to Mr. Sawyer's point, whether this function

3

was being rendered before.

4

stitutionality of any purchase of service is made depends on

5

whether a new service is brought into being, some expansional

service.

Because-, if the test of the con­

Thi
This wouldn't make any sense at all, the test

7

8

laid down by this Court in Allen was not whether new services

3

were being rendered, but whether indeed a valid secular function

10

was being performed, a public matter, a public interest service;

11

that the state needs to have performed.

12

today this is badly needed.

13

the state are in parochial schools and they have been for

14

decades.

we say that they cannot — if we are to say they do not perform

secular functions, a thing we passed, I believe, in Allen two

17

years ago — if we say they do not form secular functions them j

18

we are really saying that there is no reason for the compulsory

19

attendance laws of Pennsylvania and in fact, everything wrong

20

with using the compulsory criminal sanctions of the state to

21

require children to go to those schools, to require children to

payor under the Pennsylvania act is the school itself.

It has

,

It is not as though it got a bounty on top of what
it already had.

You see, one of the things when this act was

being drawn that I recall very well, was the Auditor-General's
insistence, and the Attorney General's insistence, Mr. Creamer's
predecessor insisted that it be shown that the amount blaimed
had been actually expended.

This is a quality provision in the

act, like the standardised testing and so on, to make sure that
the school plowed into this act — plowed into this service,
rather, plowed into child education, its own money before this

23
would be replaced.

24
Q

But to what extent is it powed in if it

Q

Ifc'.s a problem of rather large dimensions.

We have indicated that in some of the cases in the south where
the state finances a private school and this private school

would be 180 degrees different.
If a given school, religiously-affiliated school
