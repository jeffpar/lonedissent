MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

the Courts
This case coraes to this Court on direct appeal

12

from the decision of a Three-Judge Federal Court in the North­

13

ern District of California.

14

The facts of the case are these:

Judy Java was working for a small newspaper in the

IS

town of Pittsburgh, California in August of IS69,

16

employment she stepped out one day about noon, with another

17

23

24
25

During this

reporter, went to a bar next to the newspaper office, stayed
there for a while and returned to the office.
The managing editor of the newspaper* observed that
the reporter with Mrs. Java appeared to be drunk.

There was

scan© exchange? the reporter was fired on the spot and Mrs. Java
was also fired on the spot.
Later, when Mrs. Java applied for unemployment
insurance benefits she claimed that when she was in the bar she
hadhad some tomato juice and nothing more.
2

The Referee, however

1

found that she had had alcoholic beverages; she smelled of

2

alcohol; she was glassy-eyed; she staggered; her speech was

3

slurred and the referee, in short, believed the employer, who

4

maintained that that was the reason he fired her for misconduct.
After her employment was terminated, Mrs. Java

5
6

applied for' unemployment insurance benefits.

She went to the

7

unemployment insurance office;, she had an interview; she was

8

given some forms to fill out; she went home, came back some time

9

later after the interviewer had had a chance to verify whether

10

she had sufficient wages in her base period and a form was sent

It

out to the employer for him to state his version of the facts

12

and why she was terminated.

13

was ever returned by the employer, but when Mrs. Java returned

14

for her eligibility interview the interviewer listened to her

15

arid apparently contacted the employer and the interviewer be­

IS

lieved Mrs. Java, who was sitting right there.
The interviewer believed she had had tomato

It does not appear that 'this form

juice; that there was not enough evidence otherwise and found
in her favor.
Q

That is not an issue for us? is it?

A

No, Your Honor, but the reason 1 outline

these facts is because I feel that the factual circumstances in
cases like these may be dispositive when we get to the point
later when tire discuss the Goldberg versus Kelly case, I believe
the difference in factual approach, in factual circumstances,

may be —

the two words; when due,

I thought it came down to the meaning of

A

Your Honor, that issue goes to the con­

formity question as to when

6

Q

Isn3t that the main issue —

7

A

I don’t believe so, Your Honor, and I had

S

intended to leave that question "when due" in the context of the

9

statute, to the briefs.

I believe that the Court, as you know,

10

decided this case on two grounds; on a conformity question;

11

whether wesre paying when due and secondly, on a due process

12

question.

13

on due process.

It went on from the statutory ground, and decided it

And I think that that is the more important issue

14
15

here today.

I think that the "when due" problem, while it bears

16

on due process, is essentially a statutory problem which has

17

been covered in the briefs.

18

In any event the employer --

19

Q

20
21

22

The interviewer decided this was a

meretorious discharge?
A

The interviewer did decide that she had

been terminated and there was no misconduct on her part.

23

Q

You want us to reverse the interviewer?

24

A

Well, Your Honor, the Referee reversed the

25

interviewer and that basically I'd like you to affirm what the

4

1

Referee found»

2

Now, after the interviewer made this determination

3

he sent a notice of this ruler to the employer.

4

immediately appealed.

The employer

decision.

I’m not trying to prejudice the case

There was disagreement, but this was in the Referee's

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Perhaps you should

direct yourself now to the legal question.
MR. RUBIN:

Well, Your Honor, the X©w@:f court

found-, that the California procedure which suspends bengfs/tg to

5

1

a claimant while the employer appeals, was out of conformity

2

with the provisions of the Social Security Act»

S

Security Act says that the Secretary of Labor shall certify

4

a state program for unemployment insurance only if it has

5

methods of administration which are reasonably calculated to

6

ensure full payments when due, and that’s how we get to the

"when due" problem.
The lower court found that we —
C

If we determine that statutory question in

*

your favor we never reach the Goldberg question, the Goldberg*-*
Kelly questioni do we?
A

WEll, I believe that that would be right,

Your Honor, because that would —
Q

You wouldn't want us to decide the con­

stitutional question first?
A

Well, Your Honor, I believe we have to

proceed to the constitutional question because the concept of
whether it's paying when due does involve some constitutional
problems of due process.

If you find that -the -— on the

statutory grounds, if you reverse on the statutory grounds then
it may simply mean that the Secretary of Labor has — should have
the initial power to examine the California procedure, and I’m
not sure that this would totally dispose of the case.
The lower court did go on to talk about the constitutional problem and we feel that it .is presented here? we

6

i

should discuss it.
In any event, Your Honor, the question of whether

2
3

we’re in conformity with this act and whether we make these

4

payments when due, is covered in our briefs.

5

we've got to look at Goldberg versus Kelly and determine

S

whether this case is indistinguishable from that one or whether

7

this one is differant? whether Goldberg compels the decision

8

that the District Court made or whether it doesn't.

I think that here

If the Court please, I believe that this Court —

9
10

this case is very different from Goldberg versus Kelly,

11

Goldberg situation firstly, you had only two parties? you had

12

the state and you had the welfare claimant.

13

insurance you have three parties: you havethe state and you have

14

the claimant and you have the employer who pays for this pro­

gram.

In unemployment

It is his contributions exclusively which pay the unem­

ployment insurance benefits.

In the

Q

Is there a Federal grant at all?

A

WEX1, Your Honor, the Federal Government

pays the cost of administering the program, but it's all
traceable back to the employer; he pays 90 percent of this con­
tribution to the state and 10 percent go to the Federal Govern­
ment.

Out of that 10 percent the Federal Government pays the

cost of administration.
So, we have three parties here who we have to
work with: we have the state, we have the claimant and we have

'i

the employer, and the employer interest wasn’t present in

Goldberg *
Now, the second ground of distinction is that in

of benefits which had already been ruled eligible.

That is,

There was no

The claimant was ruled eligible; the claimant was

termination.
In this case, Your Honors,, we maintain that the

11
iZ

initial question of eligibility has not yet been made final.

13

On -the very form that a claimant receives, notifying him of his

14

eligibility the form says: this determination is final unless an

15

17

appeal is filed.

appeal must be filed within ten days of the initial determina-'
tion „
It is our contention that all this is within the

18
19
20
21

22

res gestae, if you will, of the initial determination.

25

The

fact that the interviewer had found this claimant eligible has
not completed the initial finding of eligibility, in our view.
And this is, we think, a critical distinction.
The employer still has the right to request to be

It is our contention, Your Honor, and that

views o
8

Q

i

At that point, Mr* Rubin, what is the fact

2

of the employer's right to appeal or be present at the inter­

3

viewer's interview?
A

4

Your Honor, technically he has the right?

5

practically, he almost never appears.

The claimant comes back,

6

in all candor, Your Honors, in the manual it says that the

7

interviewer may contact the employer and should contact the

&

employer while the claimant is sitting there, and get the

9

employer’s point of view, his version — of course if the em­

10

ployer isn’t at this office the interviewer may speak to a

11

foreman, may speak to someone else and then the interviewer will

12

hang up and tell the claimant what the employer says and a

13

determination will be made right there.
And as a practical matter, it doesn't pay for the

14

22
23

24
25

employer to try to come down to this interview.

Ninety-eight

percent of the time there would be no problem? he is not going
to appeal.

The statistics which we have presented in the brief

have shown that in 98 cases out of a hundred the employer will
not appeal.
Q

Let me ask now the obvious: if the inter­

viewer decides against the discharged employee, and I take it
the claimantthen has the right to appeal —
A

That's correct, Your Honor.

Q

-- and no payments are made during the

pendency of that appeal?
9

A

That’s correct, Your Honor.

does he get a lump sum payment then?

Your honor, if he prevails on the initial

and I think we are coming now to the most important grounds for
distinguishing that case; in welfare by hypothesis the claimant
is> destitute; has no assets.

Mr. Justice Douglas found that

the claimant suffers from brutal need; is in a situation where
he immediately desperate.

And he has to spend his days just

finding the very means of subsistence.

test, a means test.

Just a few weeks the I Jew York three-judge

2

District Court, in the case of Torres versus New York, decided

3

on January 7, rejected the lower court's decision in this case,

4

Java, and found that this wasn't valid grounds for distinguish­

5

ing Goldberg; that in the welfare case need, is the-engine that

6

pulls Goldberg. We don't believe that that engine—should be

7

harnessed to unemployment insurance to pull it along the same

8

track.
Now, we recognize that in actuality —

What about the constitutional .right of the

state to terminate

payments after the Referee has found them

to be due and the employer appeals?

After the Referee has found hint —

Your Honor, the Referee found him eligible

6

Well, I think Mr. Justice Blackmun just a

few minutes ago asked you that question.

When the interviewer-

that that suspension is constitutional?
A

I would, Your Honor -—

Q

Even though there's been an initial

determination after a full hearing of eligibility?
A

Well, this is the reason, Your Honor: you

have had one decision by the interviewer, holding the claimant
ineligible; you have had one decision by the Reforee holding the
claimant eligible.
Q

Now
Yes, but I had thought that part of your

case was that the decision at the interview stage is really not
a very reliable decision because of the nature of the hearing
and the unlikelihood that there would be evidence that the
12

1

employer would respond and things like that..

Isn't it?

2

A

3

That may he a more difficult case.

4

Q

Of course you don't have that.

S

A

That's not this case before us here?

6

Yes it is, Your Honor.

Your Honor.

7

That may pose more difficult problems.

8

Q

9

If it would, then it would also be more

difficult if it appeared at the hearing and the procedures

10

gone through before the interviewer really were intended to be

11

a hearing and some kind of a reliable determination of eligi­

12

bility.

13

A

That's right, Your Honor.

That's right.

14

In any event, I believe that we have valid grounds for dis­

15

tinguishing this case from the Goldberg versus Kelly situation.

16

Now, I think we should take a look, focus if vie

17

might, on the initial interview and see if we can arrive and use

18

what Justice Cardozo called "a robust common sense."

19

The claimant comes in for an interview? there is

20

a large office; there are a number of desks.

The claimant sits

21

down next to the desk of an interviewer; the interviewer looks

22

over the forms; there are other people waiting to be interviewed

2.3

There is no — it is not set up to be an adversarial proceeding;

24

nobody is sworn? there is no testimony taken under oath.

25

are generally no witnesses.

There

You are in a room where other
13

views generally take about 40 to 45 minutes, including all the

paperwork and the claimant is right there to talk about his

case .

A

Technically he could be, Your Honor, but I

24
25

don't believe that — pardon me?
Q

And then the employer could precipitate a

full hearing before the interviewer?
A

I don’t believe so, Your Honor, because

there is no testimony taken under oath and —

A

That's right. Your Honor.

is this your argument: the real processing

begins on the disputed claims which are two percent, more or

less?

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now? in those

this denial of benefits after such determination, frustrates

the fundamental purposes of the unemployment section of the

We believe that

Therefore, we believe that this case can be

Q

However —

Do you have any figures in tills record on

the mean time of waiting?

10

A

Yes, we do.

11

Q

May I have that figure again?

12

A

First it takes three to four-and-a-half

13

weeks for an eligibility determination to be made.

14

employer files an appeal it. takes a median period of seven more

15

weeks until that appeal is decided, so that in a case where the

16

claimant has been found eligible and an appeal is filed by an

17

employer and benefits are cut off, usually after two payments,

18

no further benefits are paid until over ten weeks after the

19

claimantfirst walks into the unemployment office.

Yet the 98 percent involves many more

hundreds of thousands, doesn't it?
A

That's correct? that’s correct, but —

Q

Well, let me ask the same question of you

I asked of your opponent? suppose that the statute said no
payments at all until ten days after a favorable determination.
Would that be unconstitutional?
A

California.

WE11, that, of course, is not this ease •—

Q

I’m asking you the question, however.

A

I believe that would be unconstitutional in

It may not be unconstitutional under a different

kind of procedure, that is where a different kind of initial
eligibility investigation is made.

If a state, like California,

had a thorough initial eligibility determination and makes its
decision on information provided by all sides ™ and I"d like
to go into that —
Q

Then you disagree with your opponent when

you say this is a thorough investigation and he says that’s an
interview, at an office desk?
A

I disagree completely and the District

Court made a finding of fact that it was, indeed, a thorough
investigation.

There are 149,000 claims every year who are

found ineligible because they left their last job for the wrong
reasons.

Over 136,000 of these claimants are found ineligible

at the initial eligibility determination.
19

Only 2,000-some odd

1

are found ineligible upon an employer's appeal.

2

that the initial eligibility determination — there are 500,-000

3

some-odd determinations, 400,000-some odd determinations made

4

each year; 136,000 claimants are found ineligible at the initial

5

level because they left their last job for an improper reason.

6

We consider that ---- 99 percent of the cases are located there -—

7

we consider that to be a thorough and reliable investigation.
Q

8

That means

That would be pretty hard to make 500,000

thorough investigations a year? wouldn't it?

Well, the statistics seem to indicate that

No? not at all.

Q

20

Well, how thorough an investigation is

thereiif the employers lose most of their appeals?

21

A

22

The fact that employers lose most of their

appeals, Mr. Justice White, means that the investigation is very

thorough.

The investigation decides that the employee is

properly entitled to benefits.

In 1969 64 percent of employer appeals

were denied»

8

Q

9

percent; is it?

10

A

WE1X, that's a majority, but it isn't 98

No, i.t9s not, but that means that those

11

5,900 claimants in 1969 who were found ineligible in the initial

12

determination and then were found eligible again upon the

13

Referee's appeal, received no benefits during the time they were

14

entitled to receive them.

15

Q

Well, you're using big figures here because

16

California's a big state.

17

would be much smaller.

18

A

If this were Nevada your figures

That's correct; that's correct, but what

19

I would like to show is that the harm that would be caused by

20

paying employees who are found eligible after this initial

21

investigation, pending the employer's appeal, is really a rather

22

minimal amount of harm, even for a large state like California.

23

The figures are very, very low, as we point out in our brief.

Q

You started to argue this on a statutory

ground, as I understood you.

1

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Harlan.

2

Q

Let me put this question to you: supposing

3

California had said all of these claims, when filed, notice

4

will have to be given to the employer and there will be a hear­

5

ing before a referee and no compensation of any kind will be

6

paid until after it’s determined.

7

statute?

Would that violate the

8

A

Yes, it would.

9

Q

Why?

10

A

Well, the statute requires that the state

11

procedure must be reasonably calculated to pay benefits when

12

due, to assure the payment of benefits whan due.
Q

13

The procedure I am suggesting would be

14

a full Goldberg —- an ultra-Goldberg and Kelly type hearing,

15

process.
A

16
17

I may have misunderstood your question.

In your hypothetical —■
Q

18

My hypothetical was that ifCalifornia,

19

instead of processing these claims in this way it is doing

20

said: we will process the claims promptly, but wewill do it on

21

a full dress hearing before a referee, where both sides can be

22

heard.

23

A

Well,

and

whetherthat would violate the

24

statute or not would depend in operation about how long it took

25

for those decisions to be made.
22

That is, if it took months and

1

months for decisions of that kind to be made, then under our

2

theory of the Federal unemployment statute the statute would be

3

violated.

4

and conducted these examinations within a reasonable amount of

5

time and paid benefits during the period of eligibility» when

6

claimants are entitled to unemployment insurance» when they are

7

out of work, then it wouldn't violate the statute.

S

now over 130,000 claimants are found ineligible at the initial

9

level.

However» if California hired many hearing referees

But, right

Wow, for all of those claims to go to a referee it would

10

require the state to make an enormous expenditure of funds for

n

referees and that is totally unnecessary, because the number of

12

cases that we are asking that the benefits be paid, pending an

13

employer's appeal is a very small number of cases, relatively,

14

it's some 8,000 odd cases.

15

claimants will be found not to have been entitled to benefits.

16

Two-thirds of ail of the payments are recouped bythe state of

17

California under their own statistics, so that we're talking

18

about a figure that's rather minimal compared to the nature of

Only less than 3,000 of those

To hire a lot more referees would be totally cost

20
21

ineffective and I would ba very surprised if California would

22

do that.

23

It has not done that
Q

Would you tell me what you mean by

24

"recouping." Do you mean in the cases where there was an

25

erroneous payment, payments later to be discovered to be
23

1

erroneous, they recouped two-thirds?

2

A

■c>

4

Two-thirds — 64 percent.

Q

How many people — is that dollars or psop3

A

Dollars.

Two-thirds, and it's logical

5

that they would, because unlike the Goldberg case where this

6

Court found that claimants are judgment proof, we are dealing

7

with working people here arid it’s very likely that they will go

8

back to Work and they will not be judgment proof or that they

9

will apply for unemployment insurance some time in the future

10

and they will be out of work again and if that were to occur

11

the State would just offset the overpayments against future

12

benefits.

13

15

Q

Well, how many weeks does the California

can pay is 26 weeks, but the average claimant in California gets

until some ten weeks after he first walks into the office? some

seven weeks after the appeal is filed.

Now, a claimant who

But then he does get benefits retroactively?

Right, but at the time that he was no

Federal statutory grounds and the constitution need not be

procedure violates due process, as well as the Federal statute.

However, if the Court were to choose to reach the

What I would like to do, very briefly, is to

review the state procedure, because I really think that it's

15

That is a very strong point, Your Honor.

16

I would just add one thing to that; a corollary to that is

17

filling in a gapfor those cl

900,OOC people applied at the initial

There are roughly 500,000 to 600,000 determinations

made initially and some 350,000 to 400,000 who are considered
eligible.

So it would be 400,000 out of 900,000, and th@

reason for the gap between determinations and between people who
D J-

1

2
3
4

come into the office , is that many people who come into the
office aren81 eligible because they haven’t worked enough weeks
or made enough money so that they are justeliminated immedia­
tely.

5

Then, in other cases employers provide no infor­

6

mation and it’s clear that the claimant has a valid claim so

7

no determination is made.

8

where the determinations are made, some 400,000 are determined

eligible and 200,000 are determined ineligible.

10

In the 600,000 cases, I believe,

You don’t have the breakdown on the

200,000, do you?

12

A

Yes —

13

Q

Do you indicate that most of them are

14

turned down simply because of basic ineligibility; that is,

15

they haven’t worked?

18

Q

Yet

19

A

Yes.

17

20

600,000?

Most of them, because they haven’t

earned enough money, they are just immediately eliminated.

21

Q

Do you have a chart that shows this?

22

A

No; those statistics aren't, in the record.

23

We only know the number of determinations.

I would rather

Do you think this case really depends on

an assessment of content and substance of this determination

To a great extent -- it depends on that,

plus the fact that the state has begun making the payments in

this case — chose to make the payments.

It hinges on both.

Yes. But you would say that that would be

a statutory bar unless a man. in California did not begin making

payments as soon as the initial interview —

A

That’s right? the employer is not charged.

is

The only party charged in that case is the state, which must

16

recoup benefits, and does recoup two-thirds.
Now, employers do have an interest in the sense

17
18

that, while the reserve account is not charged, all over­

19

payments come out of a general state fund and that it is con­

Q

The reserve fund

If the employer has no property at stake

here, then what’s ihe purpose of the constitutional claim, at
least as it relates to the employer?

35

A

1

The employer has absolutely no valid

2

constitutional claim.

He was given a full hearing before his

3

account is charged,, and as far as his interest in the property.

4

— that is his interest in the general tax fund, his ability

5

to participate in the initial determination certainly meets any

6

objection he might have as a taxpayer.
In the Gange case back in the mid-forties, this

7
8

Court held that an employer in a similar position with respect

9

to workmen's compensation did not have a sufficient due process

10

interest to have standing to bring a lawsuit based on depletion

of the fund.

That's correct, in each individual case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ASHER RUBIN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. RUBIN:

7

If the Court please, I would like to just come

8

back if I might to what we consider the central issue in the

9

case, and that is the due process question as to whether it

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

violates due process when the state suspends payments while the

11

employer appeals.

12

Q

When -the State does what?

13

A

When the State suspends payments to the

14

claimant after the initial interview, once the employer appeals.
Q

13

Mr. Rubin, it is traa that if the employer

16

wins his experience account is not charged with any payments

17

that meanwhile may be made to the employee?
A

Your Honor, you asked that question of Mr.

20

Q

Yes.

The answer is that the employer is

9

A

That8s correct, Your Honor, but let me just

10

refer to you (a) appendix 50 to 52 and the appendix 75 to 76»

11

I believe on those pages it's demonstrated what the effect is

12

on the employer and one more references there was an amicus

13

brief filed by a group of employers and I believe that brief,

14

together with the affidavits, demonstrates very graphically how
actual employers are affected,

15

Nov/, we feel that in answer to the central issue

16

as to wbhther due process is violated, we feel, of course, that

the answer is "no; it is not."

Q

central issue.

20

That is if we assume that that is the
Mr, Benson doesn't reach that.

The statutory

scheme affords the basis for disposing of the case and of course,

21

we're going to dispose of it on that basis.

22

A

23

Yes, Your Honor, and Mr. Justice Harlan

posed that early in my arguments and 1 have been considering

24

that.

25

The question as to whether we make the payments when due,
41

}

l

1

is a statutory question but I believe that it's also inexpli­

2

cably bound up with due process considerations.

3

that if you find that we are making the payments when due,

4

then this will implicitly validate it on due process grounds.
Now, perhaps I'm wrong, but we feel that these

5

tod I believe

are bound up together.
Q

7

You mean it always violates due process

8

when a person against whom the judgment is rendered doesn’t pay

9

it off
A

10

Certainly.

No, Your Honor, we are con­

11

tending, as a matter of fact, precisely theopposite; we are

12

contending —

13

Q

14

as though that was what you were arguing.
A

15

17
18
19

I understood you to talk about due process

Well, Your Honor, we are saying that when

a person wins at a trial court, let’s say, and gets a judgment,
he is not entitled to be paid right then in a court judgment,
let's say.

The defendant has a right to appeal the payment

stage pending the appeal; the prevailing party does not get
payment right away.
Q

I can understand your argument now; that

part, but I didn't understand what you said before.
A

I'm sorry, Your Honor; I hope that makes

it a little more clear.
Let me add this, Your Honors; we also put into our
42

1

brief a statement that perhaps a lesser delay, a lesser number

2

of weeks? might satisfy due. process considerations»

3

delay of some six or seven weeks during this appeals period.

4

Right now the backlog is being reduced and we believe that we

3

can hand that delay down to between three and four weeks and

6

a lesser delay? we think? would help a claimant? he wouldn't be

7

as prejudiced and we believe this would fall well within due

8

process considerations.

There is a

There is one more point that was made by —

9

Q

10

What is the subject matter in most — what

is the title in most of these employer appeals; does it have to

do with the circumstances under which the employment was ter­

cause and the employee claims that he was justified in his

A

system.

Ninety-eight percent of the time this system works with

extreme expediency and dispatch and it's only in these two per­
cent where we feel we have to give the employer a chance to have
a full hearing and to have his views aired and get his decision.
We believe we can pull the delay down to -three or four weeks and
