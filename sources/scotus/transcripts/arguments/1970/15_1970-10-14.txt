ARGUMENT OF PETES D. BAIRD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. BAIRD;

8

Court;

9

preme Court.

10

The next case on for argu­

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

This case is on writ of certiorari to the Arizona Su­
It involves refusal to admit Sara Baird to the

practice of law.

II

Sara Baird, the petitioner in this case, has gradua­

12

ted from Stanford Lav/ School, she has passed the bar examina­

13

tion, and there is no evidence whatsoever that she fails or

14

lacks to have good moral character.
And the exclusion of her, or the refusal to process

15
16

her application, stems entirely from the Questionnaire and

17

Affidavit submitted to the applicants to practice law in Ari­

18

zona.

19
20
2!

There are two questions on that Questionaire and Af­
fidavit that are involved in this case.
Question 25 requests the bar applicant to list all

.22

organisations, associations and clubs of which "you are or

23

have bean a member since attaining the age of 16 years."

24

Petitioner complied with this request and did list

25

the organizations, as best she could recall, and at the last

2

!

argument of this case, the record was supplemented to show that

2

that lists

3

Question 27, however, is the one,that petitioner did

4

not answer, and that asks "Are you now or have you ever been a

5

member of the Communist Party or any organisation that advo­

6

cates overthrow of the United States Government by force or

7

violence?"

8

CSS

S

Q

That is sort of a catch-all question, isn’t it?

A

Indeed it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

On its face,

10

it requests the applicant to make some sort of judgement about

11

the organisations which he has listed in response to question

%z

25.

n

that the express purpose of this question is to seek out un­

u

orthodox political belief, that the bar committee has told us,

is

and it is in the record, that the basic hypothesis for this

16

question is that one who believes in the overthrow of the

17

Government cannot practice law in Arisona.

18

And it is supplemented in the record by the bar committee

The question is framed so that if a yes answer is gi­

19

ven to question 27, there will be triggered an investigation

20

and interrogation into the views and beliefs of the applicant.

21

And the committee promises, without equivocation,

22

that if indeed they found from that interrogation and investi­

23

gation that the bar applicant believed in the overthrow of the

24

Government, that would be sufficient to exclude her from the

25

practice of law, or any other applicant.
3

1

Q

Overthrow of the Government by force or violence.

z

A

Yes.

Belief alone, they are not requesting here

3

4

Q

But not overthrow of the Government alone»

5

A

That is correct.

Belief alone is sufficient for

6

the committee to exclude a bar applicant, and we submit that

7

our initial and most important basis for bringing our case here

3

that the Court below and the action of the committee violates

9

freedom of belief as guaranteed by the First Amendment.

10

We submit that the case of Speiser v. Randall in

11

which this Court wrote that, in that case where a veteran's

12

tax exemption was dependent, upon the execution of an affidavit

13

claiming non-advocacy of overthrow of the Government, that this

14

Court said that that kind of taxing situation was frankly aimed

15

at the suppression of unpopular ideas.

16

Our case is even stronger.

We have here the right to

17

practice law, we have here an express purpose to exclude one on

18

the basis of the views which -they may hold which the committee

19

seeks to obtain.

20

Speiser v. Randall stands in an almost unbroken chain

21

of precedent according the essential right of freedom to believe

22

as one will the utmost protection.

23

Q

Would you—I am not sure that this is relevant—

24

but would you extend that First Amendment to include a similar

25

application for a man seeking appointment as a policeman?

4

A

i

YeSo

I would say that if you get into the area

2

of political belief or a religious belief alone„ that the po­

3

liceman would have the right to decline to answer that kind of

4

question.

5

Q

And they must hire him as a policeman?

8

A

If j in fact* the record discloses that he has

1

requisite moral character
Q

8
9

Assuming he meets whatever the other qualifica­

tions are, you say he must be hired, under the First Amendment,

10

even though he believes in the overthrow ©f the Government by

11

force or violence?
A

12

I would say that he has the same kind of rights

13

as a lawyer does not to disclose his political beliefs.

1

14

don't know how the right to be a policeman may be characterised

15

differently from the right to practice law.

16

said that there is a right to practice law, and I am not aware

17

that it has made a similar pronouncement as to a right to be a

18

policeman.

This Court has

But I would say that he would, in those circumstances,,

19

29

have a right to hold his political beliefs inviolate.

21

to whether or not he has the express right to become a police­

22

man, I guess I am not entirely sure on that point, wholly

23

apart from Fifth Amendment considerations and that sort of

24

thing.

2S

Q

And as

The First Amendment ought to be as good for
5
i

i

policemen as for lawyers, 2 should think»
A

. 2

Yes* I should think so,

And we take the view,

3

which is contrary to our opponent, that the First Amendment

4

should apply to teachers and to lawyers and to postmen and po­

5

licemen as well, as we feel it does in this case,
Q

6

Suppose you are wrong in that breadth that you

You say it necessarily follows that- because a police­

7

assign.

8

man could not be hirede it follows that a man who is a lawyer

9

can. be denied admission to the bar.

10

n

Do you think they are

identical?
A

No, 1 am not saying they are identical, and if

12

I am not correct in the breadth of my statements with respect

13

to the application of the First Amendment, I don9t think the

n

fact that there is an exclusion of a police officer should

is

necessarily dictate the exclusion of a bar applicant.

16

The entire force of the chain of cases according to

17

freedom cf belief the utmost protection, really stems from an

m

historical repugnance against the kind of test laws we have

19

had throughout the commonwealth for hundreds of years,

20

Q

Did 1 understand

you to say that it is

your

21

submission 'that this Court has held that there is a right to

22

practice law?

23

A

Yes o

24

Q

In what case?

23

A

In Ex Parte Garland,
6

the Supreme Court

there

1

facing the exclusion of a former Confederate officer because

E

he could not take the oath proscribed for him.

3

the practice of lav,? was a right, page, I believe, 379«

4

It says that

They said there is a right to practice lav? and that

3

it can only be deprived for misconduct, consisting of moral or

6

professional delinquency,

7

We submit the same exact proposition, that one's mis­

8

conduct should indeed be the basis for excluding one or dis­

9

barring one, but certainly not his political beliefs.

10

And we draw as a corollary of this argument that there

11

is no committee insofar as the practice of law is concerned

12

that should be able to say what beliefs lawyers can have and

13

what beliefs lawyers cannot have, because we feel that the ex­

14

pression of this Court in West Virginia v. Barnette, the

15

flag-salute case, that no official, high or petty, or institu-

|
IS

tion can prescribe what is orthodox in matters of politics and

S7

conscience and religion.

18

But even more than freedom of belief is involved in

1©

this case.

20

argument which would rest on freedom of association.

21

We submit also that there is another First Amendment

We have answered Question 25, we have given the list

22

of the names of the organizations, but the committee is not

23

content with that, and wishes to take the process a step further.

24
25

Q

Has Mrs. Baird been refused admission to the

bar for refusal to answer this question?

7

1

A

Yes9 she has.

2

Q

Which question specifically?

3

A

Question 27.

4

Q

5
6
7

S
9
10

It asks whether she has bean a member of any orI

ganization that advocates?
A

Yes, it calls for some kind of judgement on her

part, under the Smith Act perhaps.
Q

It doesn't say anything about her beliefs.

She

could be wholly objective about if.
Wouldn't your case be a lot stronger had she answered
,

12

A

And then there was an exclusion because, if the

13

answer had been yes and if, then, they tried to interrogate her

14

about, her beliefs—perhaps it would, but I think we would have

15

been surrendering a great deal in not only the First, but the

16

Fourteenth and perhaps even Fifth Amendment rights.
Q

17

Well, you have an additional barrier, because

the committee can say, well, you haven’t answered our question.

IS

A

19

Yes, but in Konigsberg and Anastaplo, the person

did not answer the question, and this Court felt it was right

20
*

enough for a decision to be rendered on whether or not it was

22

a final case and whether or not the issue had been presented,

23

but even apart from that, Mr. Justice Blackmun, this Court has

24

continuously, in this area of freedom of belief and associa~

25

I►

Question 27?

11

21

j

tion, required the State to come forward with a compelling and
8

i

1

controlling State interest for an encroachment into the freedom

2

of association and belief area, and we submit that the purpose

3

advanced by the committee, and in this case is to seek out the

4

beliefs of the applicant, is neither controlling nor is it

5

compelling, and we submit that it is not even constitutional,

6

and we belief that in, for example, the area of congressional

7

investigation, this Court has held that you have a right and a

8

duty to comply with an investigatorial apparatus of the Govern-»

9

menfc to seek out facts, but you have a right to draw a line on

10

questions which seek to abridge First Amendment freedoms, such

^i

as belief,

\Z

We submit that in this case, solely on the First.

13

Amendment, there is the right to drew a line on a question

14

which is aimed for this purpose and for this purpose alone»
And in terns of the freedom of association, if in

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

fact it is a deterrent for a person to list the names of his
organisations, such as the teacher in Shelton v. Tucker, it
should be even more deterring to an individual not simply to
be able to list then but to have t© characterise them under
the Smith Act, to be threatened with an interrogation or in■

vestigation into beliefs, if the answer is yes, and then to
be threatened with exclusion solely upon the beliefs of the
applicant»
.

24
25

We submit that this is in fact a deterrent and would
fall within the line ©£ cases under Shelton v. Tucker*

Can yen tall me again, Mr» Baird, if you did

Ex Parte Garland»

If Mrs. Baird had answered 27, "not to my

knowledge/1 would that have been an acceptable answer?
A

15

Wo, I do not think so, because it would have

16

been a sanction of the purpose of the committee, which was to

17

seek out the political beliefs of the applicant.
■

Q

18
1©

Do you know that an answer "not to my knowledge"j

would have been deemed unacceptable?
A

20

I think in the brief filed before this Court,

21

the committee has said that an ”1 don't know" answer would be

22

acceptable to them.
But if in fact the committee's need for data is so

23
24

strong,

I don't understand how an "I don't know" answer could j

25

be sufficient under the circumstances.

10

1

Q

How did she answer Question 27?

2

A

She did not answer Question 27, she entered the

*

3

4
S

words rinot applicable."
Q

Well, that is right»

She didn't just leave it

blank, did she?

6

A

That is correct.

7

Q

What do you suppose she meant by "not applicable" ?

8

A

Well, that, it seems to me, was part of the re-*

9

cord before the Arizona Supreme Court, that constitutionally

10

•this question could not be asked of her and that an answer to

11

it is not required under the First, the Fourteenth, and the

12

Fifth Amendments, as was submitted below.

13

We contend that, under Konigsberg and Anastaplo,

14

Justice Harlan was careful, at least it seems to us he was

15

careful, in pointing out that Speiser v. Randall did not apply

16

to these cases because there was no intent to penalise politicaJ

17

belief in the Konigsberg case.

18

And we submit that that sharply distinguishes that

19

case from ours, because there is here, and the record is replete:

2©

with evidence, an attack on political belief.

21

Finally, we find that the decision below does violate

22

due process because, we submit, it is arbitrary in using a

23

question such as this, ©f this nature, for finding out the

24

political beliefs of the applicants, particularly where the

25

committee does not request the purpose for this as seeking out

11

1

COndUCt

Q

Why would it be arbitrary if they had a right

4

A

Excuse me,

5

Q

Why would it be arbitrary if they had a right

2
3

6
7

to ask it?

to ask the question under the law?
A

If in fact they have a right to ask the question,

8

then 1 would say, and if I am wrong, then all of the points X

9

am presenting here in my brief, X guess in fact you could say

10

that it is not arbitrary, because X would lose on the points of

11

law that X am submitting to you.

12

'13
14
15
16
17

Xt is my position that it is arbitrary to seek out
political beliefs, because it really does not have that close
a nexus or relationship with one's performance as a lawyer.
For example, take the ardent hard-core racist who,
in hie mind, has never translated it into conduct, ha dis­
believes in the equal protection clause, he disbelieves in

18

Brown v. Board of Education, he disbelieves in as many venal

19

thoughts as he possibly can.

20

right to practice law.

21

22
23
24
25

X submit that that man has a

He has the right to practice law just

as much as the person who has an abhorrent left-wing belief,
because it is the point made in Ex Parte Garland that you
judge a man by his conduct.
Xf in fact he translates his venal thoughts into
conduct that is repugnant to the United States Constitution and

12
1

i

the equal-protection clause, then he should be excluded at the

2

gate or he should be disbarred, but the mere holding of a be­

3

lief will by anybody's standards depend on their own subjective

4

point of view.

3
6

Q

man a question allowed to be asked under the law.
A

7

8

11

If I lose, Mr. Justice White, then it won't be

arbitrary, and they will be able to ask the question.
It is our further point that this has an intimidation

9
10

I can't see anything arbitrary about asking a

effect.
Q

I may say that my questioning you about arbitrary

12

doesn't mean that I have no sympathy with the other part of

13

your argument.

14

A

If there is in fact an intimidating effect, we

15

would submit that if the committee on examinations and admis­

16

sions can seek out the beliefs of the bar applicants, and if

17

in fact that can fee a basis for their exclusions, then it seems

18

to us that there may well be an intimidating effect upon law­

19

yers to speak their minds, upon lawyers to join organisations

20

they wish, and perhaps even to represent unpopular and repudia­

21

ted points of view.

22
23
24
25

Q

That argument, as I understand it, is based on

the First Amendment.
A

That would be First, but we also feel that it

has a certain arbitrariness because it produces a result which
13

1

would be counterproductive to at least a maintenance of a free

2

bar which would be free to speak and to represent as they will.

3

Mot free, however, to engage in bombing or misconduct,

4

but free to think and to act and to join insofar as the law

5

permits.

6

Q

You keep emphasizing belief, Mr. Baird.

'As 1

7

look at this question again, the question asks about the orga­

8

nisations which are dedicated to overthrowing the Government

9

by force or violence.

10
11

tfow, do you reach a belief problem until you get,
first, an answer to the question?

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

You really reach the belief problem?

14

A

You reach the belief problem.

We say that it is

15

arguable on the face of the question that it calls for some

16

kind of belief about the organisation.

17

It is an arguable point.

But we reach the belief problem because, in the First

18

Amendment area, this Court has said to the States:

You are in

19

the First Amendment area, come forth with the kind of compelling

2©

and controlling State interests which you must-have to proceed

21

in this First Amendment area.

I

|

22

And, in this case, the committee has come forward and ;

23

said our compelling and controlling State interest is to seek

24

out the beliefs of those who will answer that question yes,

25

those who we deem to be dangerous because of their beliefs.
14

I

i

And once the question has a purpose of that nature,

2

we feel that; under the First Amendment; that question need not

3

be asked.

4

In NAACP v a Button the question asked there was to

S

bring forth the membership list.

6

purpose of that question be made clear and; upon examining that

7

purpose, this Court found that it was not sufficient in order

3

to permit an encroachment into the freedom of association area.

9

The Ccmrt requested that the

So we say that on the face of the question as well

10

as the clear record, supplemented by the committee on examina­

i?

tions and admissions; we do reach the belief issue, and reach

12

it in a very significant way, because they promise to exclude

1-3

on the basis of belief.

14

Q

Exclude or inquire further?

15

A

Exclude.

They ©re going to inquire further and

16

then they are going to exclude if in fact that belief is un­

17

acceptable to them,

18

to design and ask a question of bar applicants if the only

19

purpose they have is to get at the beliefs of the individual

20

applicants, because that is not part of their jurisdictional

21

domain and is not permissible under tine First Amendment.

22
23
24
25

ted we say that they do not have the power

And there is a further issue in this case, and it
does involve the Fifth Amendment.
Question 2? calls for an incriminating answer.

If

the answer given were yes, it would take the applicant directly

15

1

into the heartland of the Smith Act»

2

the invocation of the Fifth Amendment in this case does not

3

necessarily depend upon the answer given.

4

upon the question and the nature of the question as a matter of

S

law.

It is our contention that

Rather it hinges

6

If in fact one need not show an actual hazard before

7

invoking the Fifth Amendment in an area pervaded with criminal

a

statutes such as 'this, if in fact the innocent as well as the

9

guilty may claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment, as has

10

been said by this Court, and if in fact the good-faith invoca­

11

tion of the Fifth Amendment is, as 'this Court said in United

12

States v. Covington, usually one of law, then we submit that,

13

as a matter of law, one may read Question 27 and one may valid­

14

ly invoice the protection of the Fifth Amendment on the basis

15

of the question alone.
We contend that, logically, under the force of

16
17
18

Spevack v. Klein, one cannot exclude a bar applicant by refu­
sing to comply with something that has an incriminating effect, j

19

There is no logical distinction betifeen a disbarment proceeding

20

and an exclusion from the bar, and I think that point was made, j
I

21

and validly so, by Mr. Justice Harlan in his dissent in that

22

case.
Q

23

In other words, under this argument, you could

j

j

I

24

not ask an applicant whether he had committed grand larceny

25

or murder?
j

16

1

2

A

We, how­

ever, would answer a question that related to conduct.

3

4

Under this argument, that is correct.

Q
conduct.

5

The Fifth Amendment argument doesn’t accept

In fact, it is a fortiori.
A

That is true.

Although we would not concede

6

that Spevack v. Klein does not apply to bar admissions, and

7

Spevack does have a logical import to it that would carry you

8

from the disbarment situation to the exclusion situation at the

9

door.

10

So, in conclusion, we submit that Sara Baird should

11

be made a lawyer and that the area of freedom of belief remain

12

inviolate.

that the committee has no power fc© exclude anybody from the

the fact that the Court has not yet abdicated its prerogatives

advised by counsel that the committee had excluded Sara Baird
from admission to practice.
My only observation is that the Supreme Court of the

4

State of Arizona enjoys that prerogative and not this committee.

5

I thinke to put this case in what I would consider to

6

be true perspective as to what is really at issue here, it

7

might be better first just to review the actual procedures in

8

the State of Arizona in relationship to the problem which is

And

I will make specific reference to what I am speaking of,

I am referring to the responsibility and the func­

7

tions which a committee performs,

9

to take.the position which it did and which led to this con-

This is an inaccurate statement.

The committee has made no recommendation to the Court

and the Court has made no ruling in the matter,

17

The rules first provide, with respect to the obliga-

application has been considered and acted upon, and permission \

granted, by the committee to take such examination.

22

satisfaction of the committee that—and then follows a number

of things that the Supreme Court requires of the committee

24

that they affirmatively find before they permit the applicant

to sit for the examination.

The rules provide that the applicant must file an af­

2

fidavit and questionnaire, and that, Mr. Justice Slack, is the

3

instrument that is printed as the appendix, and it is also con­

4

tained in this little pamphlet which I have distributed.

5

The rule—and I am reading from page 5 of the pam-

S

under oath, is filed, the committee shall make such investiga­

8

tion as it deems proper for the purposes of determining whether

9

or not the applicant possesses the qualifications specified in

10

Rule 6, such investigation ordinarily not required within 30

i?

days, and includes the right to require a personal interview.

12

A character committee, as well as an examinations

13

committee, is faced, at least it seems to the members of the

14

committee, with a very onerous responsibility, the responsibi­

IS

lity of stating to the Supreme Court of whatever State it sits

IS

in, that this particular man or woman does in fact possess not

17

only the learning qualifications, the knowledge of the law, but

18

also possesses the character which can foe safely entrusted with

I
*

19

the many responsibilities and privileges and prerogatives

20

attached to the office of attorney.

21

Now, I would like also to emphasize to the Court,

22

that this question of due process and this question of arfoit-

23

rary treatment is put to rest so far as the State of Arizona

24

is concerned.

25

The Court will know that 1 am referring to page 9
20

j

1

of this pamphlet* that our Supreme Court has spelled cut, with

2

reasonable meticulous detail, what must be done before the

3

committee may reject, what it must do if it does reject an ap­

4

plicant.
The rules provide for two types of proceedings, the

5

6

informal proceeding and an informal proceeding.

This is before

7

the committee can consider whether or not an applicant can be

8

recommended for admission.
If the record upon which the committee is going to

8
!0

act is one which has been supplied by the applicant, if it is

11

a record which either represents what he has said filed with

12

the committee or what is on the face of the record that the

1.3

committee is going to act on, the committee may then supplement

14

that by informal conferences with the applicant.

15

But the rule specifically says that, if you are going

16

to supplement that record upon which you are going to deny this

17
18

j
man permission to practice, you must do it in writing, if he
'
asks for it. If it is an interview, it must be a stenographic j

I

19

and reported interview, it must be filed with the applicant’s

20

file.

21
22

The other rule says that, if you are going to deny
his admission—I beg your pardon—if you are going to recommend;
I
against his admission, you then must put in writing and in his
i
file the specific reasons why you are denying, recommending
V

23
24

j

against admission, and that must be available for consideration

by the Court,

That is in a

sense true, but not entirely true, ' X will do that immediately.

9

The rules provide that we may not permit an applicant

10

to sit for a bar exam, but, for many years, by tacit approval

11

of the Supreme Court, an applicant is permitted, conditionally,

12

to take the bar exam.

that she understands it ia conditionally and that if the file

is not cleared, the grade will not be completed and the appli­

I said ‘this, your honor, that because of the

9

fact that we give examinations only twice a year, that the

}

Unless we are to conclude that one who truly and sin-,
sorely believes in the overthrow of the United States

i

1

Gov@xms.Qnt. by force and violence is also qualified to practice

2

law in Arizona courts , then an answer to this question is indeed

3

appropriate„

4

The committee again emphasizes that, a mere answer of

5

yes would not lead to an automatic rejection of the applicant.

6

It would lead to an investigation and interrogation as to whe­

1

ther or not the applicant presently entertains the view that a

8

violent overthrow of the United States Government is something

9

to be sought after,,

10

Now, when counsel said that we are looking for poli­

11

tical belief, that is simply not the case.

12

in finding out if an applicant in fact believes it is proper

13

to take explosives into a courtroom, if it is proper for a law­

14

yer to go around with the notion ©f the present overthrow of

15

the Government, and -that is what we are after here.

16

s

Wa are interested

I

We are entirely indifferent to political beliefs in

17

the sense of those which are not those of an activist.

And if

18

the political beliefs are those of violence and those of an ac~

19

1
tivist, yes, I would say to this Court, we would reject them and

2©

recommend to the Court they be rejected.

21

If the answer to the inquiry was yes, it would lead to

22

an investigation and interrogation as to whether or not the ap- |

23

plicant presently entertains the view of the violent overthrow

24

of the Government as something t© be sought after.

25

;
5

If the answer to this inquiry was yes, that they are
i

26
I

1

in favor of violent overthrow of the Government now, we would

2

reject the applicant and recommend against his admission.

3

Me go on to say, and this is the committee's official

4

position in this matter, I believe that Mrs. Baird should rea-

5

iize that even though she answered the question, that she had

6

at one time been a Communist or had otherwise associated with

1

organisations not regarded as friendly to the United States

8

Government, that would not necessarily cause us to reject her

9

application.
Me would undoubtedly want to ask her some questions

10
11

as to her present beliefs.

And as to the effect of such member*'

12

ship on her qualifications to practice law, the committee would

53

again emphasize

14

is yes, the committee will then endeavor to ascertain if Sara

15

Baird does adhere to the view that the overthrow of the Govern­

16

ment of this State and of the United States by force and vio­

r/

lence would be a desirable objective, and that she would expect

18

to actively support such views.

this point that if the answer to Question 27

Now, it seams to me, if it please the Court, that

19
20

this is sufficient to put this ease in a posture, in a ciear

21

context,

22

of what is really involved in this case.
The committee has no resources, it depends upon what

23

is brought to its attention, it can only inquire by way of

24

interrogations such as this in trying to reach some conclusion.

25

When an applicant refuses to answer a question, an

2

their integrity and honesty and ability to practice lav? and

3

their willingness to uphold the institutions of this country

not in a position to sign their names to a certification that

to the practice of law.

case, whether or not a committee should be required to certify

9

to something which they don't knew is -true or not, and which

10

goes to the heart, at least we think, of the soundness of our

11

judicial system and its future usage in this country.

j

Slow, if I may be excused for having raised my voice,

12
13

And that is what the issue is in this

I will proceed.
The whole matter here, your honor, it seems to us, is

14

15

that the requirements which counsel says we have rejected and

16

which counsel says we are ignoring, of seeking after political

17

beliefs, of seeking out what this particular applicant is

18

thinking about, is wholly outside — this record.
A committee can only bring in an applicant and say

19
20

now what do you believe about this, and then you have ' to make

21

a judgement factor—are they telling you the truth or not?

22

you think it is a good idea for explosives to be carried into

23

the courtroom, to be carried into the United States Congress

24-

chambers?

25

questions, and then you finally come to the conclusion that

would have been approved.

Q

That doesn't trigger an investigation?

20

A

Nothing else in the files indicated that there

21

was anything else wrong with this lady, that she had any bad

background, that she belonged to any organisations that were

wrong, or anything else—wrong

What was that you were reading?

Show Cause, your honor, in the Arizona Supreme Court, that is

petitioner here, and I was reading from page 5 of that petition:,

Did they ask her that direct question?

24

A

She was never interrogated, your honor.

25

Q

Well, in the questionnaire, that she believed

in the overthrow of the Government by force and violence?

That is the question she said not applicable.

We had no right to ask her this 27 question, list the above,

7

the Communist Party, because we had already asked her, list

8

all the organizations of which you have been a member.

9

•theoretically at least, she had answered that question.

So,

10

The only question she refused to answer was Do you

belong to, or have you belonged to, an organisation that be­

12

lieves in the overthrow of the United States Government by forces

13

and violence?

16

Q

Where is the question which asks if she believes

in the overthrow of the Government?
A

Your honor, I said that had we pursued the mat­

17

ter and Mrs. Baird said yes, I do believe in it, or yes, I

!8

have belonged to organizations, then she would have been asked

m

to appear before a committee, two or three members of the com-

20

raittee, and would have been asked questions about what in fact

21

do you believe. Do you believe in overthrowing it now?

That is what you have been arguing.

3

A

Well, your honor, we asked the question did the

4

applicant belong, or had she belonged to organisations which

5

believed in the overthrow of the Government by force and vio­

8

lence.

7

That question was answered.
Q

That would be a pretty difficult question for

a

anybody to answer who belonged to many organisations, wouldn't

9

it?

10

A

I would say that, unquestionably, the applicant

11

could have said WI do not know, I cannot tell you," and we

12

might have asked her what do you belong to, but it doesn't seem

13

to me that the thrust of the question, your honor, is directed

14

to more than asking the applicant to put on the record what

15

her background is.

16
17
18

Q

But the organisations, not her belief in whether

or not the Government should be overthrown.
A

Well, your honor, I think the problem a committee

19

faces is this.

You ask questions that you think will hold up to you where you

21

should pursue the matter further.

to know?
A

10

Well, I am simply saying, your honor, that one

11

of the many things we would want to know under -those circum­

12

stances would be that question, but what I am trying to empha­

13

sise is that, if there is something in the file which leads

14

the committee t© believe that there is a defect in the charac­

come over for an oral interview, and the interview is steno­

titude of the committee which you have suggested.
A

Well, your honor, 1 recognise the criticism of

12

the Court and I think it is something that should be considered,

13

but, unfortunately, this case cannot be run backward ilk® you

We are trying to do that, your honor.

And you say that your interest in that is that

It cannot be run backward, but you have to stand

she might have given them soma information that would authorise
them to ask another question which you could have asked with
all these?
A

Well, your honor, if we are going to certify to

our Supreme Court that this particular applicant is qualified
mentally, morally and by character, we have to have the range
of a large number of questions.
35

Otherwise, it is impossible

1

to make such a certification, if you can't ask these questions

2

of a person who wants the privilege of practicing law,
Q

3

Well, if that is the central question, the

4

point of what you want, 1 cannot quite understand why anybody

5

would have failed to ask it.
Q

6

Well, at least in this Konigsberg, too, you

had the sanction of the majority of this Court,

1

8

A

That is right, your honor,

9

Q

That was -the majority then,

10

A

That is correct, your honor.

I would certainly

'11

say that it seems to me that all of these arguments that have

32

been made, always —- the distinction attempted to be drawn,

13

comes squarely in the rule ©f this Court, is repeated s© often,

14

it is almost like saying the Holy Mary or the Our Father to a

15

Catholic.
The question is simply where you have an interplay

16
17

of First Amendment rights and

such as this lady presents,

?8

it does then become a question of whether or not the State's

19

rights, the overwhelming needs of the State are such as to

20

require that a little old tiny answer be wanted from this wit­

21

ness.
In other words, whether or not the right of the

22,
23

State to ascertain whether the character of a person who wants

24

t© be admitted to practice law is such that he should be ad­

25

mitted, is of sufficient importance to require that that
36
t

?

particular person make a disclosure of. their true beliefs and

z

positions and expectations if they are permitted to practice

3

law.

4

We think the answer should b® that* in factf the

5

State does have that rights and whatever minor—-I say that ad­

6

visedly—minor exposure is required by this question is a

7

very small price for the applicant to pay who seeks the privi­

3

lege of a practicing attorney in the Courts of the State and

9

who should assume the responsibilities that go with that.

10

I will just say one thing in closing.

1 realise

11

that an answer to this question is not going to lead very much

12

in the way of catching anybody.

13

Court to say to the young law students of our country, for this

14

Court to declare by a formal opinion, that an inquiry as to

15

whether the beliefs of those law students are such, their

16

beliefs are such that they are permitted to espouse a belief in

17

the overthrow of the Government by violence, the fact that this

m

Court was willing to say that we don't consider it of enough

13

importance what your beliefs are in this respect, what you are

20

actually thinking in this respect, to permit the committee to

21

inquire of it, seems to me would indeed b@ an invitation to the

22

young law students to think the practice of law really pretty

23

much like what is exemplified in some of our recent court

24

trials.

25

Q

But 1 do say that for this

Mr. Baird, I have a couple ©f questions on the

37

!

application which 1 have been looking at, if you don31 mind.

2

I notice that in the answer to Question 25 about the

3

organisations, it lists in turn a member of the Young Republi­

4

can Party, then the Young Democrat Party,

5

How, in light of your arguments about this sensitivity

6

to inquiry into political associations# I wonder how that squares

7

with your argument on the failure to answer the other questions?

8

In Question 25# petitioner exhibited no concern about discussing

9

former or present political affiliations,

16

MR, BAIRD:

I submit# Mr. Chief Justice# that by an­

11

swering Question 25 and trying to comply with the committee

12

with a question that# on its face# has no incriminating purpose

13

or no purpose t© seek out some unorthodox point ©f view# or

14

something of that nature# that petitioner did consent to answer

15

•that question to help the committee# if in fact it wanted help.

16

But Question 27 is not just a bland or general 51 list

17

your organisations.B

It has# written right across it# that

18

there is a right answer and a wrong answer# and that you are

19

supposed to make a judgement about -these organisations you list

20

in Question 25 that you point out.

21

Q

What is Question 25?

22

A

Question 25 requested that the petitioner list

23

all organisations to which she has belonged since age 16»

24

she refused to answer the further question# Question 27# which

25

went into whether it is a Communist Party or any subversive

38

Then

t

organisation,, and she says that* by answering Question 25, and

2

listing the names of organisations* she does not waive her

3

right t© draw the line on a question that requires her to

4

characterise whether these happen to be subversive organisa­

5

tions, and she doesn't waive her right to resist a question

6

which, now we have been told, without any equivocation, is

7

aimed at seeking out heretical and unorthodox political belief.

8
9

io

Q

Did that question actually call for her to tell

about the party she belonged to?
A

Yes,

Question 27 said "Are you now or have yon

n

ever been a member of the Communist Party, or any organisation

12

that advccat.es overthrow of the United States Government by

13

force ©r violence?"

14
15

Q

Is that the one she answered by referring to

the Republican and Democratic Parties?

16

A

No* sir.

17

Q

Did the question actually call for her to give

18

the names ©f the parties?

19

believe that both of those parties are subversive,

20
21

Q

Because there are many people that

Let me g© back, counsel.

Suppose the question­

naire said "Are you a member of the Republican Party or the

22

Democrat Party, check on©," I would think that you would get

23

a very hospitable reception in any Court t© say that that is

24
25

not a question which they have any right to ask.
think on prior decisions.
39

I should

I

But yet she had no difficulty answering and saying

£

that she was a member, at one time or another, of both major

3

parties..

4

©bout resistance t© inquiry into political belief and political

5

association,

6

That doesn’t really square with your protestations

h

It does to this extent, Mr. Chief Justice.

If

7

•die committee had come out and told us that the purpose for

a

Question 25 is the same purpose as for Question 27, and that

9

is to find out those who are members of the Republican Party

10

and to screen out those who hold Republican beliefs, 1 would

11

say she would have the same right to not answer that question

12

as she has t© refuse to answer Question 21.

13

Question 27 is significantly different,

It asks her

14

to make a judgement, under the Smith Act or under whatever kind

15

of substantive principles she must, to see whether these are

16

organisations which advocate the overthrow of the United States

17

Government by force and violence.

IS

And on its face it has the suggestion -that they are

19

after political belief.

20

committee has new told us, indeed it is to find out what her

21

beliefs are.

22
23

Q

And that doubt was resolved when the

Have they stated it is to find out what party

she belongs to?

24

A

She listed in Question 25 -—

23

Q

I understand she listed it, but I understood

4©

1

also that the committee has admitted that they wanted to ask

z

her about whether sh© belonged to the Democratic or Republican

3

Party.

Is that true?

4

A

Mo» she has already listed that she belonged to

5

the Young Democrats and Young Republicans*

6

knew is whether she believes in the overthrow of the Govern­

7

ment by force and violence.

What they want to

8

And we submit that they could ask her Do yon believe

9

in the equal-protection clause and Do you believe in complying

10

with the orders of this Court--"the belief of a right-wing» of

11

a left-wing» of a middle-of-the-road, axe really inviolate,

12

we submit.
tod when the purpose is such, as it is here, to seek

13
14

out beliefs, to use that as a trigger to an inquiry into be­

15

liefs, then that question is on its face and as it has been

IS

supplemented by the committee in the record, not worth an­

17

swering .
So we again submit that Sara Baird should practice

18

19
20
21

22
23

law.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. WiInter.

Thank you, Mr. Baird,
