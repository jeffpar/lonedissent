MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Number 135s Organization for a Better Austin against

Ke&fe.
Mr. Long, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. LONG, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. LOHGs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

•the Courts
This case is on writ ©f certiorari to the Appellate
Court of Illinois, First District.

That court has approved

an injunction which prohibits Petitioners from passing out
literature of any kind and from picketing anywhere in the City
of Wesfcchester, IIlinois.
This blanket prohibition

on First Amendment

activities has been in effect fox- now sver three years.
Petitioners, the Organization for a Batter Austin, which I
will refer to as the OBA, is an integrated community organiza­
tion in Austin, which is a racially changing neighborhood"'!n
the City of Chicago's far west side.
The individual petitioners are certain officers
and members of the QBA and the chairman of its Real Estate
Practices Committo®.
Q
help.

Mr. tong, could you give me © little geographi

How close is Westchester to Austin?
2

A
seven miles»

Respondent’s brief refers to it as being
There is nothing in the record which indicates

the exact distance , but in general, the Austin community is
the next Chicago community to Oak Park, «which is the first
western suburb, and Westchester is further west than that»
Q

Are the two adjacent?

A

They are not adjacent»

Q

Something in between?

A

There ~~ they are roughly connected by some

side roads and a freeway»
Q
A

Hew large is Westchester?
Westchester, according to the s60 Census, is

18,000 persons, approximately»
Q

X don’t want t© put you off your argument, but

X know it hasn't been briefed by either of you, but looking
over these papers last night, the question remained in my
mind; is there a final judgment here?

This is a state case?

you’ve got a temporary injunction? and your adversary says he
wants to go to trial and develop the facts»

Is this a final

judgment?
A
Q

Well —
X mean X don’t want to argue it»

X know you

haven’t directed your attention to it, but I should think
possibly you might want to —
A

Well, let me deal with that right now, Mr,
3

1

Justice Harlan.

2

that this has been

3

denominated temporary, after a full hearing, or at least as

4

full a hearing as the "parties wished at that time,which laid

3

out the activities and the claim which — the basis of Mr.

6

Keefe's claim that his rights had been invaded.

7

In our petition for certiorari we set out
the injunction was issued, although

We admitted the activities in the trial court? as

8

a matter of fact, most of the pamphlets which are in evidence

9

ware submitted by defendant because defendants firmly believed

10

that all this material was protected by the First Amendment,

11

and attempted to be vary candid about their activities.

12

13

Also we indicated that our sol© plan or sol® defense,
was First Amendment? and we call Your Honors attention to the
Logan Valley case, the Food Employees versus Logan Valley case,

15

which arose in almost identical facts to the situation.

16

believe it was an interlocutory or temporary injunction which

17

was considered final by this Court because it remained in

18

effect until modified by the Court and the same is true, as

19

wa set out in our reply brief with respect to temporary injunc­

20

tions under Illinois law.

21

Q

1

Are you arguing, in effect, that if the Court,

22

if this injunction is much the same as one which, by its

23

terns, was given a three-year life? that is that this activity

24

was enjoined for a period ©f three years.

25

final enough for review even though there might be another

4

Would that then be

i

■

1

stage in the proceedings?

z

A

Well , . according , as 2 read the

.Legal Valley

3

case, this is final because it remains subject to — it

4

remains in effect until it could be modified,

5

no other defense but the First Amendment defense.

0

our purposes —
Q

7

Ms©, we have
So, for

you really are going for a theory ©£ degrees

8

of finality and this is final enough for review because it has

9

sustained First Amendment rights for three years?
A

10

That9s correct, and 2 think it would be

11

speculation on my part to suggest to the Court what the resultj

vi

would have been one way or the other if if had gone fc© a

13

final —

14

Q

Supposing you lose this ease?

What happens?

15

A

The case would be remanded under the pro-

10

esdures and I suppose we could move to dissolve or the Res­

1?

pondent could move to ~ that a final order be entered.

18

Q

Then nothing more remains t© be done down

A

Actually, 2 don®t believe there is any dispute

there?

19
20
21

between the partiesi if there are additional facts, material

22

facts which we would attempt to get before this Court if it

23

came her©

again.
Q

24

Well, X just wanted to mention the point that

bothered m@ a little,

25

5
i

1

The Respondent» Jerome Keefe» is a real estate

2

broker who does business in Petitioners8 neighborhood in

3

Austin and the OBA believed that his active solicitation of
persons who lived in that neighborhood to sell their homes,

5

constituted, contributed to the rapid .changeover of portions

8

of the community fram integrated to all Black®

1

9

In short, Petitioners claim that Respondent was
a panic peddlar.

In the OBA, at a meeting in Austin, at which

~ t© which Respondent came, asked questions of Respondent and

10

asked him t© sign a an© solicitation agreement®"

11

refused and it's following that refusal that the literature

12

distribution question here took place®

13

15

Some members of the OBA distributed literature by
the

The trial court mad® a finding with respect t© this distribu­

6

that

I

1

parenthetically, no residents were summoned fe© the doors to

2

3

that they were in any way disturbed.

4

There was no complaint from these residents

They were distributed at a shopping center and
were distributed in front of a church to which Respondent says j

5
6

he belongs.
However, irrespective of this finding that there

7
8

was no disruption, no disturbance whatsoever, the trial court

9

had enjoined Petitioners, quote; “From passing out pamphlets,
leaflets or literature of any kind and from picketing anywhere j
;
in the City of Westchester, Illinois. And this is the injunc-

10
U

13

tion whiehhas been in effect for the past three years.
i
■ However, while refusing t© enjoin picketing.

14

15

court did enjoin all picketing in the City ©f Westchester and

IS

it did this, absent any evidence that Petitioners had engaged

17

in any picketing in Westchester.

12

j

The Appellate Court in Illinois sustained this

18
'9

blanket injunction which the trial court had entered and it

20

came to the unprecedented conclusion in sustaining it that

2!

Petitioners had no First Amendment' rights? there were no First

22

Amendment rights involved here.

23

justified this conclusion on two bases; first# and 1 quote;

24

"The purpose of the defendants was not to inform

j

And the Appellate Court

'the public ©f a matter of public interest, but the sole purpose!

25

7
1

I
1

?

was to force defendant to sign a "no solicitation” agreement.

2

The court did not consider relevant to its determination on
this issue whether the subject of Respondent's real estate

4

activities in a racially-changing area was a matter of public

5

interest or public concern.

6

The Appellate Court also justified making West-

7

ch-esfcer off limits to Petitioners® distribution of leaflets

e

©n the basis of a determination that Respondent's right of

9

privacy was invaded by this distribution.

10

And finally

„

j

the Appellate Court held that the

1!

scop© of this restraint*, mainly everywhere in the City

12

of
j

•

13

was not overly broad.

14

I would like to treat first that liberty which the

15

constitution has traditionally afforded in the peaceful and

16

orderly distribution of literature by hand? the doctrine of

17

no prior restraint? then consider how the Appellate Court's

!8

justification for its conclusion that the right of free speech

19

is not involved here? does not comport with the long history

20

of decisions involving the First Amendment by this Court.

Your argument, then, does go to saying that

The basic evil

I wouldn't attempt to answer that? Your Honor»
of prior restraint is that? as in

this case,, regardless of whether you have had — if you have

9

a wrongful restraint and the injunction is reversed on appeal?

W

that injunction would still have prohibited the conduct which

1?

is subsequently held to be protected by the Fifth Amendment

12

for the duration of the time it took to repeal it.

the situation in the Birmingham cases? Shuttlesworth versus

Birmingham and Walker versus Birmingham» where the state law

which can prohibit a parson who is brought before the Court

has been held to be a valid exercise of state power.

This was

1

i
Turning now to the Appellate Court's justification

18
19

j

for this sweeping prior restraint? I would like to first ex.

20

<amine,the Courts’s determination that there was an invasion of
_

...

privacy — the injunction here? namely: anywhere in Westehestexj.
21

j

22

It is implicit -that the Appellate Court mad® the determination

23

that all of Westchester is within its own privacy, personal to ;

24

Respondent and that within this other privacy, Petitioners-’

25

First Amendment activities of passing out literature in an
11

1

orderly and peaceful manner, critical of Respondent's real

2

estate activities in Austin, violated his privacy.-

a

is implicit that any literature, regardless of its content.

4

given the fact that the injunction goes to all literature,

5

regardless of what it says, would have invaded Respondent's

6

privacy if distributed by' Respondents.

7

In so doing -~

8

Q

9

A

No? it doss not, and I have no idea of what

Q

Could be a small place; could be a large one,

it is.

12
13

Does the

record show the square mileage of Westchester?

10
11

You gave us the 18,000 figure.

Indeed, it

geographically?

14

A

From my knowledge *o£ the western suburbs,

15

j
these ar® all single family houses, so that I would assume that

IS

it was, quite a low density area, perhaps with a few apart­

17

ments, of course.
•

Certainly not an urban density.

.

I believethat the Illinois courts in this deter­

m
19

mination of privacy have disregarded the authority ©f Time

20

v. Hill, which held that the First Amendment rights are

21

applicable where the state attempts to create rights of

22

privacy.

Indeed --

23

Q

Wasn't Time against Hill a libel action?

24

A

Your Honor, Time v. Hill was, I believe, a

25

privacy action where the court said that the nature of the
12
.

!

i

hara which the plaintiffs sought to redress was emotional

2

harm to himself rather than based on damage to his reputation»

3
4

. which is one of the classic formulations of the privacy
action»

3
6

Q

It wasn't a prior restraint case in the sense

of Hear against Minnesota?

7

A

No? that9s correct.

And we're using Time in

8

an a fortiori sense, that if a restraint cannot be justified

9

in the context of substantive punishment, it certainly cannot j
■

10

foe justified in terms of a more serious restraint, which is

11

prior restraint.

12

Q

Has there been any strict prior restraint

13

case since Near against Minnesota that represented the classic

14

features of Near against Minnesota?

15

A

I know of no case which is near Near versus

18

Minnesota; cases which the Respondent has cited which would

17

injunctions have all been picketing cases.

18

asked this Court to declare that the distribution of litera-

19

ture is equivalent to picketing; something which is contrary

20

to the longstanding precedents of the Court,

And Respondents

•

21
2Z

And I would also point out that in Time the First
which
Amendment standards/overcame the privacy cause of action there,

23

' were in the context of false statements, where as ! have

24

indicated, there has been no finding of falsity here.

25

Furthermore, the — Illinois has created a new and
13

j

1

surprising definition of privacy to justify this restraint on

£

First Amendment conduct»

3

never purported to prohibit the distribution of written

4

materials concerning a person's business activities which

5

relate to public issues ©f interest and concern»

The law of privacy has heretofore

Taking two heads of privacy which Respondent may

S
1

argue are applicable here* which have traditionally been

8

dealt with in notions of privacy and its brief history since

9

the Warren Brandeis article? that is first there has been no .,

aO

interference with Respondent's peaceful enjoyment.of his home

!1

and property.

12

Westchester in a shopping center, door-to-door,

Here -the distribution was to third persons in

.

There has been no unreasonable publicity given to

13
14

his private life, another heads traditional privacy laws

15

not just a matter of public interest, but it concerned

16

Respondent8

17
18

public activities.

j

Indeed, activities, in which, he

went to a public meeting in Austin to discuss.
The Appellate-Court's opinion gives us an indica­

20

tion of what -the nature of this newly-created Illinois privacy
■• •
right is, and it says there is no evidence to show that

21

Plaintiff was engaged in panic peddling in Westchester or that j

22

he intended to do business in Westchester,

19

23

The Appellate Court is apparently making the
?

24

determination that the subject of Respondent's activities in

25

Austin is inappropriate for Westchester and the distribution ofi
14

1

leaflets on the subject thus invades Respondent's privacy.

2

It is significant feo 'know, however, that the court refused, to

3

enjoin the picketing in Austin

4

matter of Respondent’s activities was considered appropriate

5

for Austin but not for Westchester, which even attempting to

6

use the unlawful purpose doctrine in Austin, the .number of

7

picketing cases would create the anomalous situation of it

8

not being against public policy to talk about or to distribute

e

materials concerning a particular issue in one place but in

o

another, absent the determination that the manner itself was

ii

somehow' 'objectionable.
Q

12

13

so presumably the subject

Mr. Long, does the record contain evidence that

leaflets were distributed at the church on Sunday?

14

A

Yes, it does a

15

Q

Do you have any comment as to the propriety of

16

that particular aspect of your leaf1®ting?
A

17

I would refrain from commenting on the pro­

18

priety ©f -that.

19

a charge of a privacy violation in terms of: was Respondent

20

there? did it interfere with his worship, that is whether there

21

was a conflict between his right to worship and First Amendment

22

rights

23
24
25

1 think the issue would have to be posed in

Because, I don’t think that a parson going to and
from a church servies out on the sidewalk has a right to be
free from the distribution of leaflets, ©r a newspaper critical

15

1

of Respondent, if you will? written material.

2

indeed, never brought tills to the attention of the court.

3

This was Petitioners who said: we did this, and Respondent

doesn't say he was there.

A

I don't believe so, Your Honori’ I believe

Q

And —

Well, this is only a temporary injunction.

11

You donet necessarily have to put on your whole case in order

12

to get temporary relief? do you?

A

Mo? that's true.

The issue certainly is, that

14

we're proposing to the Court, is whether the evidence justi­

15

fies this type of sweeping injunction.

16

speculative to consider~at this time what evidence "might

And Respondent,!

I think it's perhaps

of literature by hand cannot enter.

22

him censorship power, both over theliterature which Petitioners

23

can distribute and over the literature over which other

24

residents of Westchester can receive.

25

Furthermore it’s granted

Aside from the asserted invasion of privacy here,
16

1

the other justification for the injunction is that the distri­

a

bution was not deemed to be for a proper purpose» The Appellate

3

Court says in its opinions

the purpose of the defendants %?as

1

4

not to inform the public of a matter of public interest, but

5

the sole purpose was to force Plaintiff to sign the s'n©

S

solicitation agreement," that is the agreement that he -would

7

not solicit sellers to sell -their homes in Austin.
But, speech does not lose its protection of speech,

8

-

9
10

because it seeks to influence events or to persuade to lawful
action.

Indeed, -this Court in -the recent Brandenburg case,
?

11

reaffirmed the right to advocate unlawful action except where

12

that advocacy is directed to producing imminent lawless action

13

and where it is likely to incite or produce such action.

A

Wells, ‘there it might be more difficult.

Well,

assuming that his neighbors had homes and 1 should think they
would be subject to receiving literature and to have tlx at
literature be protected by the First Amendment as anywhere
©Isa.
Again, I am referring to a situation which does not

\

amount to picketing; that is patrolling of the person upon
which the criticism is made about.

Yesj 1 would say that.

That8s how I read the prior decisions of this Court.
What the Illinois Appellate Court has done is to

j
decide that it does not approve of First Amendment activities

j

engaged in for certain purposes.

j

That3a court's determination

clearly violates the First Amendment, because this Court in
*

...

.

Mear has indicated that to have to satisfy a judge that speech
is published with good motives and for justifiable ends, is
...
the essence of censorship.
W@ believe that in this case there has been censor- ;
ship sad outright prohibition for three years.

Both ©f fixe "

Appellate Court's justifications for this prohibition ©si
literature distribution are dangerous precedents.

This

precedent could form the basis for an effective system ©£
censorship and could justify criminal penalties or damage

19
s

j

.

1

awards for those that speak a right and distribute, literature

2

for unapproved purposes or in public places within this

3

widely-defined zone of privacy.
This is precedent which licenses that unfortunate

4

5

human tendency which is the antithesis of an open society?

6

namely: the desire to suppress the critic, the advocate of
'

7

change and the controversial.

j
1

j

For all the reasons presented here today in

8
9

Petitioners’ brief we respectfully request the Court to hold

10

this prohibition by an injunction on First Amendment rights,

11

unconstitutional and order that it be dissolved.
Q

12

Well, doesn't your argument really come down

13

to geography?

Because you were permitted to distribute

14

leaflets in Austin and what you are really complaining about

15

is Westchester.

16

A

That's true.

17

0

So it seems to me it is a geographical

18

argument rather than one of such broad breadth as your last

1©

remarks were.
A

20

Well, the notion of residence, first, is not

21

a clearly defined concept.

People live throughout any urban

22

area so, in the sens© that it is protecting a broadly-defined

2S

residential right of privacy, here a city of 18,000 as being

24

within, that gone.

It5s precedent for defining other areas

which constitute residences.

25

.20
i

For examples in Chicago, Marine

j
j

d

City is — Marine City or Outer Drive East or Lakepointe

cy

‘

z

Towers are certainly residential areas and I think it would

3

justify enjoining distribution of literature to persons who

4

were going to and from work from those large tower apartments.

5

Q

Well, suppose he lived next door to his place \

6

of business.

Do you think that the injunction would have pre-!

7

vented you from distributing leaflets around the whole block?
A

a

would Have don© in that case.

w

But 1 do think that the precedential value of this

11
12

decision is far broader than just the geographic scope.

13

see it is relating to a court deciding that certain purposes

14

are unapproved: albeit for a certain geographical area to

15

talk about certain, things in and I think the notion ©f privacy

16

her© is extremely dangerous.

Normally

there would b® a hearing in a matter of weeks or months after

In an appeal

of this character you have to file your notice of appeal

IE

within 30 days.

13

tremendous backlog of cases and itss not unusual to have 16

14

to 18 months between the time of appeal and the time of its

disposition, so that accounts, I think, for a great deal of

18

the delay here.

X think it was a loose lab®! in there, Your

injunction,

X think what the parties have understood it to be

and have treated it as is a preliminary injunction which has
been in effect until now.
*

I think there are several facts which have to be
highlighted here considering the propriety of whatjthe court
did below.
.

First» Mr. Keefe’s real estate business and
■

■

■

activities were' solely confined to the west aid® of Chisago.
He did no business in Westchester? he did not us® his personal j
residence in any way in connection with his business? he did
not solicit his neighbors for listings? his only relationship .]
with his people in his immediate community was that typical
neighbor relationships th® social relationship? relationships

we all haw© with people who reside near by.
0

Well, suppose there was a radio station which

served this 18,000 community where he lived.

24

That 18,000

1

figure represents -the community in which his residence was

2

located; is that right?

3

A

That's correct, Your Honor»

Q

And suppose there was a small weekly newspaper,

5

as thereis often in a community of that sis;a»

So I think you have the medium of the

message really was the problem here.

You had a use of hand-

incidental point of communicating with neighbors.
The record shows that they first went out to the

house with the handbills in hand and asst with Mrs. Keefe? his i

wife? and said: unless Mr. Keefe can meet with us we are going
out and distribute these to your neighbors.

there, because I believe it was Mr. Keefe’s activies to which \

I interpret it, Your Honor, as the parties

have, of limiting it to prohibiting activities directed only

But you want us to put our approval on an

I would like to comment, if 1 could on what 1 think

13
14

is the real vie® of 'the activity in Westchester here.

We are

15

all most vulnerablej I think, in our relationship with our

16

families and with ©ur neighbors and here I think is & very

17

calculated attempt to play on this weakness and to direct

18

activities at us that will compel us to take some action, not

The Organisation for a Better Austin takes the

4

position that it has an absolute and unqualified right to

to do it.

stances as the equivalent of newspaper distribution»

think, looking at what has occurred here that that would be

sloganeering to say that it is always entitled to that same

protection,
I think there is handbilling and handbilling.

12

Certainly in many, many instances it is clearly entitled to

13

full First Amendment protection.

14

the Organisation for a Better Austin here is more akin to our

15

peaceful picketing cases in which we have said; OSi-tainly this

m

is a protected First Amendment activity; it is communication;

17

but it is something more than eornraimisation, and being some­

18

thing more than speech — we are entitled to reasonably

19

regulate it,

20

But I think the conduct of

I think Hughes versus the Superior Court, decided

21

some 20 years ago about this Court — by this Court, is a good

22

example of such circumstances»

24

a store in which they shopped to hire in proportion to thair

Th© court there held that such activity could be

31

examined to see what the purpose of the picketing was.

purpose having been examined and found to be improper, the

court said it was subject to reasonable regulation by the

4

State of California.

Do I understand that that, in affect, represents
your position here today?

14

Yes, Your Honor? I believe the temporary order

15

restricts only their physical presence in the community of

Westchester.
I think on© of the serious issues we have her® is

17
18

whether in contemporary America, with our many confrontations,

19

dissent, protests, that whether we will permit the residential

It is

Men who could not be persuaded by reasoning? men who

32

be willing to take,
I think we should consider in looking at this ease*
the heavy burden upon our public servants* the men who guide
our cities and the urban problems that 'they have.

It wasnot

too long ago this Court had before it the Gregory case* which
involved a march in the vicinity of Mayor Daley's neighbor”
hood.

And I think thought was given to what this type of

activity should be encouraged or permitted which is so dis­
ruptive of family and neighborhood life.
I think the activity here by the Organization for a
Better Austin* insofar as it was directed towards the communiti
in which Mr. Keefe resides* suffers from the same thing.
Indeed* I would say it resembles here residential picketing
which-' in every reported case it has been concluded that
residential picketing has either been enjoined? it has either
been made the subject of criminal sanction or administrative
coase and desist orders.
There is no reported case that I have been able to
find* and I refer also to Professor Kamin’s article on
residential picketing and the First Amendment.
Q

Well* is there ^residential picketing involved

The injunction order — there was no residen­

at least in the reposted cases, but you have one or a group

of people standing in front of someone's home with some form

15

particular difference as far as the homeowner is concerned, to

16

having someone standing in front of his home with a derogatory

17

placard that can only been seen by his neighbors for the most

18

part, and going door-to-door with that same message and dis­

19

tributing to them.

They were not trying to keep people from passing in and
There8s not the element of intimidation,

Now, I see no

20

So, I think the conduct of the Organization for a

21

Better Austin here is very analogous to what our residential

22

picketing situations are.

23

Quite recently in the Rowan case 1 had occasion to

24

consider, in a different context, of course, but the fact that

25

there is a right to be let alone which must be balanced with
34

the right of others to communicate and 1 think we are faced

2

again with a similar resolution of conflicting rights here»

type of situation.

I don't claim,. Mr. Chief Justice, that

this is an analogy to the Rowan case , but I do think the

opinion expressed there, that there must be a balancing and

15

certain circumstances between the right to communicate on the

one hand ' and the right to be left alone on the other had

17

applicability to this case.

13

I might say parenthetically the State of Illinois

19

last December 15th has adopted a new constitution which, as

20

part of its bill of rights has expressly provided for the right

21

of privacy, along with the

22

sod sura provision of the act,

as part of the search and

In summary, I would say because we accept and

24

tolerate as part of our society what I would consider inci™

25

dental invasions of our privacy for a greater good because of
35

1

freedom of the press, because of circulation of ideas , 1 do

2

not think that we must therefore legitimize direct,, inten­

tional invasions of privacy made for the purpose of forcing

conduct which cannot otherwise be secured., and where the
