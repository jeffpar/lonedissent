MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mro Epting, you nay proceed whenever you are ready.
ARGUMENT BY EUGENE A. EPTING, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR* EPTXNGs Mr. Chief Justice, and may ifc please

6

hhe Court,, X think the Court will find that this case is soiae-

7

whafc uniqrue.

8

of: the cases before this Court involving boards of education,,

9

the board ha3 been here either complaining that it should not

I would venture to say that in most, if not all,

10

be required to do that which it has been told to do. or defend­

11

ing itself in claiming that it has done all that is required to

12

do.

13

Here you have a board of education defending itself

14

against a charge that ifc is doing too much.

15

the Clark County Board of Education has tried to avoid the

16

entanglement of federal court decisions in regard to the ques­

17

tion of desegregation, so far has succeeded, and when I hear

18

and read the argument in regard to the tribulations of

19

Charlotte and Mobile and Clarksdale and Bessemer and Jefferson,

20

I think they have acted wisely on that score.

21

In other words,

But we have come fc© the proposition where having

22

avoided entanglements in federal court orders running our

23

schools, we find ourselves faced with a state court injunction

24

that says we can#t do wha'fc we have done because in undertaking

25

to honor the Fourteenth Amendment rights of some people, we
2

1

are■ thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of

2

others,
Now, 1 would agree with the tenor of the argument

3
4

in Charlotte that all of this busing of students from one com­

5

munity to another is not in the best interests of education,

6

if 1 understand one of their points correctly.
But in the Clark County case we are not dealing with

7
8

court ordered busing, we are dealing with what has been called

9

pocket busing to a limited extent*

We are a small school dis­

10

trict.

We have only 11,00© students.

11

elementary schools.

IE

they call it satellite zoning, but it means the same thing.

13

Vie have only thirteen

We call it pocket busing; in Charlotte

In undertaking to pocket bus, and if the Court wishes

the record,

14

to loofc at

15

that shows the geographical locations of these pockets of

18

students who were bused to schools which were formerly pre­

17

dominantly clear of the other race.

18

I think you will see a map on page 174

If you will look at page 167 you will see the chart

19

of si neighborhood plan which was twice adopted by this board

20

and which shows the extent -- the dot on the map shows the

21

extent ©f racial miking,

22

tion and racial balance and integration, when we get it all

23

down to .a common denominator, we are talking about mixing the

24

races in the schools, and that is what it amounts' to in plain,

23

simpla language.

Now, when we talk about desegrega­

3

1

Q

Has the board here decided to do it?

2

A

The board her® decided to »- well,

let’s put it

3

this way ■-*> the board felt that under the decisions of this

4

Court, and particularly the decisions of the Fifth Circuit

5

Court, we were compelled to do it.

6

Q

But you weren't under sn order?

7

A

We were not under an order and we didn't want

8

to get under an order.

9

{Laughter4

Q

10

So does this case pose the question I asked

the counsel who just stepped down?

11
12

A

It is strikingly similar except they are talk­

13

ing about a statutory -.

Q

14

-i

1 mean in terms of the power of the board on ifca

own to do something.

'35

A

16

Yes, sir.

Now, it is our position that when

37

this Court decided Brown.II/

this Court said that there was

18

a duty on the boards of education to d© something more than

19

back, off on state ordered discrimination.

20

already said that.

21

is stop segregating by law, then we didn't need Brown It and

22

we didn't need Green vs. New Kent County.

23

said that is unconstitutional.

Brown I had

And if that is all we were required fc© do,

Brown I had already

But when this Court said, in Brown II, we are going

24

to give you, in effect, some guidelines, we are going t© tell

25

i

i

1

you what you have- got to do to disestablish the existing

2

system, and then it followed with such things as Cooper vs.

3

Aaron, which says you have got to take steps to eliminate

4

formally segregated school systems,, route and branch, and

S

when it comes along with Green vs. Wew Kent County, of course,

6

a number of years later, and says the boards of education have

7

an affirmative duty to take whatever action is necessary to

8

disestablish the dual system, that clearly calls for some af­

S

firmative move, not just backing off and leave things the way

10
11

they are.
That is the way we have interpreted the decision,

i2

and that is the way the Fifth Circuit interpreted it.

Maybe

33

the Fifth Circuit isn't the final word, but we are in the

'34

Fifth Circuit* and we have to honor its decisions.

15

(Laughter4

16

Consequently, some plan had to foe formed that would

17

eliminate the separat ion; in the schools, a neighborhood plan.

18

And if this Court would say that all that a school board is

19

required to do is sone without discrimination as to race and

20

set up a neighbor hood plan, we can do it, but we will have

21

some black school® and we will have some white schools with

22

-- well, we had on® with 525 whites and '20 'islacks.

23

another one with approximately 500 whites and 19 blacks, be­

24

cause the neighborhoods are made up that way.

/

25

W® bad

So, as I say, the result of our efforts is that in
5

1

— and we had some five-to-four decisions in that court or,

2

rather„ six-to-five*

3

was that the most feasible way or fiiost r@ason.afo3e way, as those

4

who preceded me have discussed, was to zone and pick: up an

S

area that is not contiguous to the zone and take the children

6

from that area to the gone school.

7

They were not unanimous.

But our decision

It might foe in order to accomplish what we under­

8

stand is our affirmative duty.

9

you could gone in such a way as to bring in substantial numbers

Kow, it might be said, well,

10

of 'both races.

11

system, it involves not only the City of Athens but the entire

12

county — the pattern of housing racial distribution is such

13

that when you step out to pick: up another area, you pick up

14

mart® of what we might call the wrong race than you do of the

15

race that, you are trying to get in.

16

The pattern in our — this is a county-wide

So that won’t work.

We were told that it Blight he possible to break

17

this school system down into a different plan, have the first

!8

three grades or the first four grades in certain schools,

19

have the fifth and sixth or the fourth, fifth and sixth in

20

other schools.

2!

the entire county because you have got to have a foas route

22

that covers the entire county for each of two separate sets

23

of schools.

24

the first-graders from an area adjacent to what is now a

23

school that accommodates them and take them off to some other

When you do that, you are going to bus over

And you are going to pick up the young children,

school and bring back some fourth-» fifth-» and sixtb-qraders,

3

or fifth and sixth» whatever it is, bring them from next door

4

to a school over to one that accommodates their grades.

5

And you are going to have to go over to tbs other

So we decided» the board decided that this pocket

6

busing was the most feasible way of wiping out the problem

7

within the means chat this board has.

8
9

Now, it happens that no plaintiff in the lower
court — and, by the way, 1 assume this court has the informa­

10

tion as to how this thing proceeded, an injunction or two

11

injunction suits were filed in the Superior Court of Clark

12

County.

13

tiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia and the

14

Supreme Court of Georgia says that in taking studesits of one

13

race into a school that is predominantly of the other race,

16

that that is discrimination for the purpose, that is, of

17

achieving racial balance, that is discrimination.

18

then people out of that school in order to make room for those

19

you brought in is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment

20

rights of those taken out.

21

Now,

The injunctibns were denied.

The people, the plain­

And taking

it happens that nobody included in any of

22

these four of the five pockets, four pockets that are being

23

bused to a more distant school, not one of those persons is a

party to these law suits.

25

The people who are being pocket

1

When you pocket bus or however you arrange to take

2

students to a school that is already filled to capacity, you

3

have to take somebody out of that school in order to make

4

room, for those brought in.

S

If is that simple.

The result was that we had ~~ the board had to re­

7

ticular schools, not on a basis of excluding whites but re­

aligning the

so that the students in those areas went
We had to make room for those brought

in.
If the Georgia court is right in saying that by rea­

11
12

soning in order to accommodate those brought in, then no course

13

is left open to the board of education except the freedom of

14

choice or a strict neighborhood sone, leaving the racial

So this board has done what it thought it had to do

23
24

under the decisions of this Court and, of course, the Fifth

25

Circuit,

Brown II and the decisions following it require
8

1

affirmative action by the school boards.

New Kent County —

j

2 |

and that was followed in Raney and Monroe — called for the

3

same affirmative duty and in Monroe, where the board had a

4

i

zone plan, with a free transfer provision, the court plainly

S

held that the affirmative duty was not satisfied by a

s

neighborhood sane plan unless it resulted in substantial rais­

7

ing of races in all of the schools.

8

Now*' we in Clark County have frankly gerrymandered

9

zones not to retain segregation but to try to do just the op­

10

posite, to try to mist them in the schools, to avoid the en­

11

tanglements that were consequent on maintaining a segregated

12

system.

13

We obviously bad a dual system prior fc© 1954.

we

14

began the process of eliminating that in 1959 with one of the

IS

transfer plans which were thought as vogue in the South then,

18

in 1983,- prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we had our

17

first integrated in Clark County.

18

followed various methods in trying to get our system, keep

19

our system in line with the law as we understood it.

20

can*51 compete with the decisions of one court saying go one

21

way and the decisions of another saying go another.

22

Subsequent t© that, we have

But we

We have to know where to go, and this decision,

23

thi© question in this Court is a simple question, but its

24

answer involves tremendous problems. If this Court should
j
say you have complied with the law when you create neighborhood

25

9

1

schools, that la all right.

2

said when it said you have an affirmative duty to take what­

3

ever action is necessary to disestablish the dual system, then

4

we think this Court would have to uphold the action which is

5

taken by the Clark County Board of Education.
Q

6

But if this Court meant what it

In this ease, it is not whether or not you

7

have, complied with the law, this is not quite the question you

8

put.

The precise issue in this question, in this case, as I

get it, is whether you violated the law by going further than

io

simple neighborhood soiling.
A

ii

12

Is that right?

Well, yes, whether we violated the construc­

tion of the law placed on it by the Georgia Supreme Court.

Q

But that is what the Georgia Supreme Court

15

That is right.

The Georgia Supreme Court, in using the Green

case as its basis, says that no person shall be excluded from

20

a school because of his race.

21

who were zoned into another school area were not zoned there

22

because of race but obviously they were zoned there because

23

black students were being brought in.

24

That is the only way we saw to work it out.

Now, we concede that.

20

the «- with regard to the decision ©f the Georgia Supreme

Court, is after saying that the action of the Clark County

22

Board of Education in the adoption ©f its plan violated the

23

Fourteenth Amendment rights ©f those students who were r-equired

24

to go to a different zone, it says also that its action

25

violates those provisions of the Civil Rights Act dealing with
11

the definition of desegregation, 407 and 2000 (cl and 2000(d|6,

Whatever Congress may have meant to say,

The Georgia court says that the action of this

16
17

board violates the provisions of that section of the Civil

18

Rights Act, and I don't think it does.

19

that decision is also in error.

20

I think, that part of

The problem that we have is the basic problem which

21

faces this Court, what exactly is a school board required t©

do and what can the school board d© in order to meet its

!

Mr. Leverefct?

7

MR. LEVERETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please,

8

fche Court, I would like to direct some remarks at fche outset

9

to some tests that have been proposed here and then deal

IQ
11

specifically with fche contentions of the petitioners.
Pour different tests, as 1' understand it, have been

12

proposed by the -counsel in the cases that have been argued

13

here yesterday and today.

U

postulated a rule that declares it the duty of each system to

15

prevent the existence of an all-black school, if "reasonable

16

alternatives exist»"

17

The Fifth Circuit itself has

When all-black schools do exist, the Fifth Circuit

18

has said that, fche state or fche system must specify valid

19

reasons for those schools.

20

a distinction between not only fche de jure and de facto

21

systems but, in addition, it draws a distinction between

22

urban systems on the one hand and rural systems on fche other.

23

This is indicated from its decisions and the Orange County

24

and Hillsboro cases on fche one hand, involving urban systems,

25

and its decision in fche Monroe, Louisiana case involving a

Further, the Fifth Circuit draw©

14

Now, the Fourth Circuit has postulated a rule In

the Charlotte case in terms of whether the all-blacfc schools

are capable of abolition by reasonable means.

5

Department* in its brief, refers to a rule of feasibility

8

which seems to be taken from the Green ease*

The Justice

7

The Petitioners in the Charlotte and Mobile cases,

8

on the other hand* have stated a point-blank requirement that

8

"every black child is to be free from assignment to a black

10

school, an identifiable racial minority school at every grade,

11

subject only to this qualification."

12

In the case of an "absolute unworkabilifcy, " now

13

apparently this exception is aimed at such places as Washington

14

and' Newark where it would be physically impossible to bring

15

about a realisation of what they seek.

16

We submit in this case that all of these tests miss

17

the point.

They involve standards which differ only and only

18

in degree.

Under them, the sufficiency of a plan is made to

19

depend upon a statistical appraisal.

20

formulated tests which we submit if any state legislature had

21

attempted to enact, would have immediately been dec laired uni
constitutional by this court as being void.

22

They involve court

We submit that they invite another generation of

23
24

litigation.

They either avoid or assume without acknowledg­

25

ing it a determination of the basic questions which lurks in
15

1

all'of these cases that have been argued thus far, and that

2

is what does the Constitution require, what did you mean in

3

Brown.
Does the Constitution simply prohibit state en­

4
5

forced discrimination or does it require an actual integra­

6

tion of the races in the Schools?
Mow, the problems it seems to me, with the position

7

/

8

of the government and the position that the .petitioners in

9

this case have to take, is that they seem to assume that the

10

Constitution does require integration except where it is not

11

reasonable* where it is not feasible, or where it is absolu­

12

tely unworkable.

13

cause it makes the scope of a constitutional right depend upon

14

the' ready

15

rights of a minority child differ in places such as Newark,

16

in Atlanta* or in Charlotte, North Carolina.

17

Now,, this, we submit, is inconsistent be­

availability of a remedy, and it would make the

area of that in this case* they were both black and white

20

parents that were objecting to being assigned on the basis of

21

race in order to bring about this 20 to 40 percent ratio in

22

each school that the petitioners were seeking to implement.

23

Our position is simply that the Constitution does

24

not require affirmative state enforced integration but that it

25

only prohibits state enforced segregation.
IS

So being, we say

1

that the assignment of children, to achieve racial balancing

2

is not required but is unconstitutional* consequently the

3

majority to minority transfer option that has been discussed

4

we submit that also is not valid* any more than the minority

5
6

to majority transfer option struck down Goss is valid.
‘
Secondly, Mr. Justice white, I don*t think it is

7

involved in this case, for reasons that I will get to, but we

6

submit that a state or a board of education cannot on its own
policy determination, in ®n effort to alleviate de facto or

10

s
whatever you call it racial balance, undertake to affirmatively

11

assign students on the basis of race in order to bring about

12

and there are four instead of three here -- without at the

11

for this purpose we can assume, although we will certainly not

concede the validity of this proposition that says that educa­

tional, equal educational opportunity cannot be achieved in

fact unless there is an actual integration of the races.
But, assuming that,

15

I think

it does not follow, we submit,

16

that the rights of the group seeking compus ory association

17

to achieve this end of equal educational opportunity can be

18

superior to those who seek to avoid it.

22

A

No,

sir,

the cases in the Fifth Circuit struck

23

down the whole pupil placement statute on that very reason,

24

that even though they gave the student an unlimited right to

25

transfer out,

that he was still initially assigned to the old

school that he had been assigned to on the basis of race and

the burden was put on him to do that which the board of educa­

tion itself should have carried.

I wasn’t proposing that as a remedy.

I was

proposing that 1 understood your proposition to encompass that

as a permissible remedy„ that you say that if in the first in­

stance race was taken into account in the zoning or the pair­

ing,, it is quite right from the beginning.

9

A

The proposition that I formulated in response

10

to a question that Mr. Justice Douglas asked was that it was

11

not any zoning to begin with but a complete freedom of choice

12

along the lines that the Fifth Circuit set out in the Jefferson

13

case in 372 Fed 2d 836, where they said that — they set out

14

the requirements and said that if a student does not assign

himself,

you have to assign him to the nearest school on the

Yes, sir.

You do?

Yes, sir.

Q

And I suppose you wou3d say that if its conduct

was authorized by the statute, that the statute was unconstitu­

18

A

That is correct, sir.

1 Know my time is up,

19

but I would point out that we also contend that this plan is

20

void because it placed an unequal burden upon the Negro

21

respondents by requiring them to be assigned out of their
