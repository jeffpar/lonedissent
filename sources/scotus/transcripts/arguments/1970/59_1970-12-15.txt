MR» CQX:

Mr, Justice Black, and may it please

the Court:
Yesterday I pointed out that since the Federal

S

Reserve Act of 1913, managing other people’s monies in various

6

fiduciary capacities has been a traditional banking function,

7

and that the individual managing agency account has been one

8

way of performing that function»

9

intervivos trusts, executiveships and the like and other forms

10

II

It allows tastimentary trust 3

of agencies»
In the beginning the Federal Reserve Board

12

collowed the common law and forbade national banks to co­

13

mingle the assets of different beneficiaries or different
\

14

principals,

About 1920 it began to relax that rule and in

15

1937 there came a major relaxation that permitted the co­

16

mingling of the ratings of different trusts, execufciveships

17

and guardianships and the like.

18

the now familiar common trust fund grew and flourished.

19

-is partly, I think, because of the economies of comingling

20

which reduce the management costs and partly because of the

21

advantages of diversification,

And under that new regulation

22

Q

And that, you say, goes back to 1913?

23

A

Well, the statute goes back to 1913; the

It

24

comingling was not authorised until about 1920; then on a very

25

small scale and then comingling on the scale that we are now
3

1

familiar with for the common trust fund; came in in 1937»

z

But , in 1937 the world was not relaxed so far as individual

3

managing agency accounts werecoassesaadd, which —
Q

4
5

That is for inter vivos trustees or testi-

mentary trustees —

0

A

Exactly, sir —

7

Q

—that could participate in a comingled fund

A

Yes.

8
9

for —
The effects of Regulation 9 which is

1©

in issue in the next case is to extend to managing agencies

11

the sole privilege of comingling that have proved so success-

IE

ful and so free from abuse in the case of trusts and that kind

13

of fiduciary capacity»

14

Indeed, when you come to look at Regulation 9 you

15

will see that it treats cominqling strict trust funds and

16

managing agency funds in exactly parallel capacity»

'17

Well,

the reasons for this were very well stated somewhat later by

18

the Federal Reserve Board in a letter to Congress speaking of

19

the public interest in having banks continue to offer this

20

kind of managing agency comingled investment account* in a

El

letter quoted in the back of our brief on Page 45-A, where it

22
23
24
25

pointed out that there were three advantages; first was a
means of performing a traditional banking function while
efficiently and at less cost; second that it provided competi­
tion to the mutual fund, which of course in these cases,

4

i

1

is seeking to preserve its monopolistic or qu as monopolistic

2

position free from competition.

3

it enabled a combination of investment and other special

4

fiduciary services»

5

And third f in special cases

During the time that Regulation 9 was under con>

6

'

siderafcion, the Securities and Exchange Commission took the

7

position that any comingled fund in managing agency accounts

8

would be subject tc the Investment Company Act»

9

the interest in the funds would be securities; that the fund

It said that

10

orthe bank would be an issuer or underwriter and that con-

n

sequently there had to be registration under the Investment

12

Company Act»
I would point, put .in this connection-*--■■however,

13
14

indeed, emphasize that while the SEC and Chairman Carey and

15

Chairman Cohen, stood very stoutly on the position that th

16

must be conformative with the Investment Company Act, they

1?

never took the view that the managing agency comingled invest­

18

ment account was unlawful or in any way against the public

19

interest»

20

and later Chairman Cohen and the staff all indicated that they

21

would look favorably at exempting a managing agency comingled

22

investment account from any provisions of the Investment

23

Company Act that might be a bar to performing the functions

24

authorised bythe Comptroller under Regulation 9 and later

25

reported by the Federal Reserve Board»

Indeed, from the very beginnings as Chairman Carey

5

t

2

Q

Now, suppose that a single investor, under

the 1940- act won't be applicable?

3

A

No? not at all.

The 1940 Act would not be

4

applicable to the type of common trust fund involving an

S

inter </ivos or testimentary trust because it is expressly

6

exempted.

7

8
9

10
11
iZ
13

Q

Nor would it be applicable to management

-- for a single investor?

A

No,

That's correct.

If we see . —- if the

SEC said brought it under the Investment Company Act»
Q

. Wasn’t it the issuing of certificates of

participation or whatever you call it —
A

I believe not, Justice White.

I think their

14

position was that even if there were no piece of paper, it

IS

would be the interest, the undivided interest would neverthe­

16

less be regarded as something that brought them under the

t?

Investment Company Act.

18

That’s siy understanding of the test matter.

19

Of course,as we do it, there are those certificates.

20

Q

For a purpose, I suppose?

21

A

For the purpose of carrying — we say for the

22

purpose of carrying out our fiduciary responsibility and for

23

no other purpose.

24
25

There is a controversy between the Comptroller and
the Commission which led to Congressional hearings.
6

During

1

that controversy Citibank developed a plan in which it was

2

believed would comply best with the requirements of the banking

3

laws and be satisfactory to the SEC and the Investment Com­

4

pany Act.

5

Now? what he contemplated was this: Citibank would

6

continue to receive assets in a fiduciary capacity under the

7

relation of managing agent and principal -with all the

8

fiduciary duties, or with discretion toinvest those through a

3

common fund.

To the extent necessary to comply with the

10

Investment Company Act the common fund or account, as it came

11

to be called, was given a separate structure.

12

the customer investors, were given certificates of participa­

13

tion which -were non-assignable, non-trans ferable, which would

14

terminate upon their death.

15

The principals?

The certificate holders were given the right to

18

choose as they wished a committee made up of five individuals,

17

as it developed? two of whom were not required to be connected

18

with the bank. And the committee of participants were given

19

power to terminate the bank investment advisory contract at

20

any time at the end of the year, subject, however, to the

21

possibility of that adverse role.

22

The bank has custody of all of the assets; as

23

managers, attends to them in every way; chooses what invest­

24

ments to make and so forth.

25

operation the whole thing is carried out by the bank, subject

So that inthe ordinary day-to-day

7

1

only to this possibility of the certificate holders exercisinq

2

common control to kick the bank out*

3

There are a few other minor departures»

They are

4

outlined in our brief in footnote 12»

5

affect the theory or the fiduciary relation; certainly none

6

effect the individual fiduciary relation between the bank and

7

the customer investors, the principals, and the bank continues

8

to be required to conform in all respects, except those I have

9

mentioned and the other details to the provisions of Regula­

10

11

None of them,, I think,

tion 9«
Now, from the -standpoint of the banking laws, it

12

seemed important that all these activities be conducted, as

13

the Federal Reserve Board later put it, as an am or depart­

14

ment of the bank, as One of many functions within the trust,

15

department of the bank*

16

contract alone might be enough to do that, it seemed advisable

17

to the bank and its lawyers that a majority of the board of

m

directors should also be officers of the bank*

19

that that led to the application for an exemption from Section

20

10-C, which provides that a bank may not have a majority of

21

the board of directors of an investment company*

22

And, while the investment advisor9s

And it was

When the matter came before the SEC it made three

23

critical findings*

24

account which is technically an investment company —

25

Q

The first, on page 60 points out that this

Page 60 of the record?

1

A

2

It pointed out that this was not the kind of invest-

Page 6

of the Appendix$ yes»

3

ment company at which Section ' 1 (c) appeared-to be 'allied.

4

Although Section 1 (c) is general in terms it does hot appear

5

that it was directed at the type of open-ended investment

6

company represented by the account.

7

Then, skipping a few sentences;

"It is clear that

the account is substantially different, both in purpose and in
9
19.

11

nature of operation from the bank-dominated investment com­
panies which led to passage of the act,"
The second finding is over on page 62;

"In our

12

opinion," the Commission said, "the bank has shown that sub­

13

stantial safeguards are present here against conflicts of

14

interest which could arise as a result of the bank’s commer­

13

cial banking activities,"

16

And the third finding, which is implicit, is that

17

"The exemption to permit these activities to go forward would

18

be in the public interest,"

19

We submit first, in our legal argument, that if these

2

findings are reasonable — these conclusions are reasonable,

2!

then the Commission’s order is plainly valid.

22

the statute, which is on the bank of our brief on Page 7-A,

23

plainly gives the Commission power to exempt any person con­

24

ditionally or unconditionally from any provision or provisions

25

of this title.

Section 6(c) of

Surely the words "any provision or provisions
9

1

of this title/' are broad enough to encompass the provisions

2

of Section 10(c).

Now? the fact that literally the bank

,

3

the account falls within Section 10(c) doss not defeat the

4

power to exempt* because of course* the mere purpose of the

5

power to exempt is to take care of cases which literally fall

0

within the language of the statute*

1

And furthermore* that has been the consistent inter­

8

pretation of Section 10(c) for 28 years*

9

Congress when Section 10(c) was pending before it in 1940 that

It was explained to

10

the aim was to take care of cases which had not been foreseen

n

by the draftsmen* which might fall within the literal language

%z

of the statute* but in the judgment of the Commission, not

13

really within its policy or sphere*

u

Now, at the time Section 10(c) was before Congress,

15

there was no comingling of managing agency accounts.

16

trust funds, the nearest analogue, were exempted from the

17

Investment Company Act,

18

Commission's findings are reasonable, then this is the type

19

of case for an exemption.

20

Common

Consequently, I suggest, that if the

The Commission's findings that the proposed relation­

21

ship between Citibank and the account is not -the kind addressed

22

by Section 10(c), seems to me to be supported by five con­

siderations*

Now* this account* of, course* is wholly' the

Third* I would emphasise that there is* in this

instance* but not in the kind of investment company which

23

Q

And the Comptroller8s representatives have

been instructed to be on the lookout for such things in the
instructions we have quoted in our brief,
I would emphasise that this direct fiduciary

9

up for the purpose of evading the banking laws and getting

10

out from under the scrutiny of the Comptroller*

11

shouldn’t say, "evade?"

deceit about it.

13

on, as I said a moment ago, constantly under the ciontfrol of

14

the Comptroller.

15

I perhaps

I don't mean that there was any

Whereas, all of these activities are carried

The result is, from those four differences, that

16

none of the evils which were pointed to during the investiga­

17

tion of the bank securities affiliates and bank dominated

18

investment companies, are possible under the present setup.

19

Indeed, not even the Petitioners argue that they ate * '

20

Mr. Levin argues that the SEC findings are

21

immaterial, because Section 10(c) imposes a rigid barrier to

22

the bank ever having a majority on the board of directors,

23
24
25

where there is any possible conflict of interest.

Even so,

it’s found that this is not the kind of thing that 10(c) is
directed at, even though the Commission finds that there are
13

‘ -

1

adequate safeguards and even though the Commission finds that

2

the existence of the account is in the public interest»

3

I submit that that argument is unsupportable for

4

four reasons? first, it simply contrary to the plain words of

5

Section 6(c) which give power to invest without restriction,

6

except for the necessary fundings»

7

Second, and very important, the characteristics of

8

the account, or the relationship between the bank and the

9

account, it is said to give rise to -the danger of abuse here,

10

are characteristics that are attendant upon all fiduciary

11

banking functions»

12

so dangerous as to prohibit this kind of relationship, because

13

it authorised such fiduciary banking functions in Section llfkI

14

of the Federal Reserve Act, now Title XII, Section 92(a)»

15
16
17

And we know that Congress didn't find them

It would certainly be incongruous if Congress some­
how had singled out this one special form of activity which
is just like the others so far as any of these problems are

18

concerned, and forbidden in — especially since in this case

19

©n© has not only the usual safeguards of the

20

lationship in the Comptroller's supervision, but if now has

21

■fche additional safeguard of the Investment Company Act»

22

fiduciary re­

We have outlined in our brief a number of indica­

23

tions, as the Commission did in its opinion, that the Congress

24

was not seeking such a rigid separation between banks and

25

investment companies as Mr» Levin argues.
14

There is a

1

grandfather clause in Section 10(c): banks are allowed to act

£

as investment advisors which* from a day-to-day point of view,

3

is the really controlling manager of the investment company,

4

and because, and we lay great strength on this, the one form

S

of comingling that was known at the time the Investment Com­

6

pany Act was adopted, the Common Trust Fund, was exempted from

7

the Investment Company Act and even part of the analogue (?)

8
9

even though the Commission said we couldn’t bring ourselves
within it»
Now, the remaining question is whether thereis

10

n

adequate support for the SEC findings that the very adequate

12

safeguards against abuse of the bank's control over the fund

13

to the detriment of investors«

14

by point, all the abuses which it was said might result and

15

found that they

16

were adequate safeguards against them»

were

The Commission took up, point

not sufficiently serious and that there

17

Judge Baselon took not quite that point»

The same

18

arguments were made to the Comptroller and he rejected them»

19

The Federal Reserve Board scrutinised most ©f them, in the

20

letter that is set forth at the end of our brief and it con-

21

eluded, too, that there were adequate safeguards and that the

22

existence of such funds would be in the public interest»

23

Consequently, we submit that the Commission findings are

24

reasonably based in the record and that it’s order should

25

therefore ba affirmed and the judgment of tte Court below,

AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF FIRST

NATIONAL CITY BANK

8

MR» FRIEDMANs

7

Mr, Justice Black, and may it please

the Courts

8

At the outset I would just like to explain, in view

9

of the somewhat unusual posture of this case, that the Com-

10

mission is not appearing here in defense of its order, ones

U

why the United States is appearing in this case? and secondly,

m

why we think that the Commission's position in this ease V

13

does not undermine the validifey of its decision»

14

As has heen indicated, when the Commission granted

55

this exemption in 1966/ the result was 4 to 1, with a strong

16

dissent against the granting of the exemption by Commissioner

17

Budge.

The Commission vigorously defended its order early in

10

1967

19

upheld the order»

20

before the Court of Appeals and that Court unanimously

Now, by the time the case reached this Court,

21

however, and this Court had granted the petition, there had

22

been a significant change in the membership of the Commission»

24

14

that time the Commission didn't know what its position would

As of

be because only two of the original Commissioners were then
available.
But, I want to say that the Commissionhas not dis­

17
18

I think fchafcmerely is a rather briefer

avowed its decision and it seems to us that basically that the

19

validity of the Commission action must be determined on what

20

happened when it acted; not on the basis of the fact that

21
22
23
24
23

sometime thereafter there had been changes in the membership
of the agency and that the present membership is not prepared
now to state what position it would take if the issue came
before it.
And there was another change in the offering of the
18

I

Commission which ~~ we talk about shifts in membership —

2

that Chairman Budge, who was the lone dissenter# has announeedj

3

his retirement# so that presumably by the time this case gets

4

back to the Commission there will only be one of the original

S

Commissioners and we think that the Commission by definition#

8

is a continuing body? it continues as an entity without regard

7

to changes in the ©membership and that if the Commission’s

8

action was valid when it was taken# it should be upheld even

9

though changes in the body since that time might suggest that

10

if the Commission were to consider it anew the Commission migh;

n

corae out the other way.

12

The Commission in this case has not asked this

13

Court to remand the case for it to take another look at the

u

case and I think the reason it hasn’t done that is again the

15

same reason: that there is no majority ofthe Commission that

18

is prepared to take any position at this time.

17

So that in these circumstances —0

Did the Solicitor General ask

29

In this case you mean?

20

Q

Yes.

A

No# Mr. Justice# we remarkedthat we came

18

21
22

23
24
25

—

into the case because it was our belief that in view of the
importance of this issue and in view of the fact that the
Court of Appeals had unanimously upheld the Commission’s
order# we feel it was not appropriate that the validity of the
19

i

order should just be defended by the bank, which had received

2

the exemption.

3

addition to that, although we haven81 set it forth in our

4

brief, the Government, the Solicitor General representing all

5

Government agencies, has an interest in the basic legal issue

6

hers, which is the scope of judicial review of an agency on

7

granting an exemption, a question that this Court has not

8

directly dealt with, as far as 1 know.

9
10

We felt there is an interest in this and in

So, this is the background as to why wa think it
was appropriate to give weight to the discretion of the Coxrs“
mission in this case even though the Commission is not here

12

appearing in defense of its order, 1 would like to turn

13

briefly to the merits, which Mr. Cox has fully covered, and

14

why we think in this case the Commission clearly has not

15

abused its discretion.

16

The statute under which the Commission has entered

17

this exemption, Section 6Cc) gives the Commission authority

18

in the broadest possible terms that allows it to exempt any

19

persons, any transactions, or any class of persons from any

20

provision of the statute.

21

is certainly nothing in that sweeping language that in any

22

way suggests that Section 10 of the act is not within the

23

Commission's power to exempt.

24
25

It couldn't be broader.

And there

What we think Congress is obviously contemplating
by this section is that the Commission

20

shall have authority

j

1

to exempt any transaction, any person, any security within

2

its terms, if a particular fund for which exemption is sought

3

comes within these public interest factors that are listed as

4

the conditions for the exemption.

S

is necessarily, appropriate in the public interest, consistent

6

with the protection of investors and the purposes fully in­

7

tended by the policy and provisions of the act.

That iss if the exemption

8

Now, the determination, the weighing of these many

9

factors that make up this broad public interest standard, is

SO

of necessity something that calls for very difficult, close

n

and subtle factors of balancing, of judgment.

12

kind of thing that is capable of precise measurement exactly.

13

You can3t take a yardstick and say whether it reaches a cer­

14

tain point and therefore is or is not consistent with the

15

public interest,

16

This is not the

And we have developed in our brief, and as Mr, Cox

22

has indicated at some length, the Commission certainly in this

23

case did not abuse its discretion.

25

Section 10(c) was put into the act because of a lot of abuses

a couple of things? first of all, 9.18 specifically prohibits

the bank from having any interest in the account and in addi­

tion to that, the account8s own prospectus states that it

will not borrow any money at all? and finally, that provisions

of the Investment Company Act which specifically prohibit

24

hibits the bank from having any interest in the fund except in

25

(a) any interest in such fund

That is that the bank itself — if it
