This sas® is her© on direst appeal from the
District Court in the Southern District of Ohio.

The District

Section 834, which is set forth in part ©n p&g®
3 ©f our brief, provides that whoever knowingly violates
regulations formulated for the safe transportationof hasardous
materials, shall be fined up to a thousand dollars ®r imprisoned
for not raor© than a year.
The information in this case charged the Appellee,
which is a corporation engaged primarily in the manufacturing
and shipping ©£ chemicals and fertilisers with violations ©£ the
regulations, which is ©Iso set forth on page 3, dealing with the
contents of shipping papers.
The regulation requires that the shippers state on

2

substances which he is shipping»

3

the shipper was shipping sulphuric acid and the regulations

4

require him to state sulphuric acid ©a the shipping papers,

5

which is the name, and "corrosive liquid,18 which is the classi-

6

fication»

7

In this case, for example:

This safety requirement serves (Essentially two

First it indicates to the carrier what kind of labels

14

an accident ©r a fire to quickly identify what the substance

is and to take whatever appropriate steps, such as clearing the

16

As we read that ruling the District Court held

that the Government has t© allege and prove, not on.ly that the

5

Appellee knew it was shipping a dangerous article without

stating its full name and proper classification on the shipping

So, the question in this case —

A

Y@s, it was, Your Honor.

I thought it

was? I did not know.
Th® question in the case then is a simple ones it
is whether a defendant can fee convicted under this statute for
intentionally engaging in conduct that; is prohibited, even
though h® doesn°t know that the law prohibits it.
We believe that a shipper or carrier can be con­
victed under these circumstances.

25

4

Our position is simply that

I

proof ©£ knowledge of the pertinent facts is what is essential

2

and that proof ©£ knowledge of the law is not, as the defendant

3

is presumed t© know the regulations governing transportation of-

4

dangerous articles, and that he8s charged with

5

under the fundamental principi® that ignorance ©£ the law dees

0

not excuse its violation by one who intentionally engages in

1

conduct which the law forbids®

8

9

that knowledge

Charging shippers and carriers with dangerous
substances with knowledge of regulations regarding their trans­

1©

port seems to ba a perfectly reasonable thing to do,

In the

II

first place, these substances are dangerous, and that alone

12

would signal the possibilities of the existence ©£ a regulatory

13

scheme regarding transportation.
So tills case, in that sense is similar to Old,ted

14
15

States against Freed, which this Court decided this? month,

And

IS

in that ease th© Court ruledand specific intent or knowledge

17

that guns were unregistered was not an eWsential element in the

18

©rime of possessing an unregistered firearm,
Sn effect, it ruled that the individual could he

19
20

presumed to know, or charged with knowledge of the registration

21

requirements.

22

In tills case and in numerous regulatory areas

23

there is another factor which makes it particularly appropriate

24

to charge the peopl© engaged in forbidden conduct with knowledge

25

©f the regulations, and that was that this Appellee and most ©f
5

1

the people who are brought under a prosecution under this

z

statute are in the business ©£ shipping dangerous substances.
So, our fundamental position is that there is no

3
4

basis in this ease 'for making the exception *© the principle

5

that ignorance ©f the law is no excuse.
We would like to emphasis© three points in that

6
7

connection.

We would like to discuss the language of the

and the history of the statute.
The first point deals with the language.
statute says: knowingly violates regulations.

The

This is a typical

regulatory pattern in numerous areas where Congress

simply

©an8fc fill out the details of the statute it sets forth a
general prohibition and leaves to the administrative agency the
responsibility of filing in the details and designating the
specific conduct that's forbidden.
And tliia language "knowingly violates regulations"
is standard terminology that's used in numerous statutes.

We

hav© cited some ©£ them in footnote 7 of ©ux brief at page 13.
We submit that if Congress in these various
regulatory areas had sat forth the prohibited conduct in the
statute itself there wouldn't bs any question but that the
Government's only obligation would be t© prove knowledge of the
facts and not knowledge of the law.
S

1

For example: in this case the Congress had written

z

a statute that says '•Whoever knowingly ships sulphuric acid

3

without stating on the shipping papers that it is sulphuris

4

acid and that it is a corrosive liquid? shall be punished.B

S

X submit in that situation there wouldn't ba any question that

0

our burden of proof would h© what we have alleged in the infor­

7

mation her© s "knowing conduct .55
Similarly? if Congress had written? as it would

8
9

have had to in regulatory statutes? as it likely would and as it

10

has in cases where it has set forth conduct that is prohibited

IS

in the statute itself? set forth a number of different kinds ©f

12

conduct and then had one provision that says? "Whoever knowingly

13

violates the statute ©r the statutory provisionsf shall be

14

punished."

15

would have fc© prove knowledge ©f the facts and not knowledge of

16

the law.

w@

submit the same result would obtain? that we

17

W@ don't think the results would be any different

18

be«ause Congress adopted a convenient shorthand in this case as

19

a means ©f delegating responsibility to the administrative

20

agency? in this case the Department of Transportation? and for

21

incorporating all the various prohibitions that are involved.

2Z

We realise it's possible to read the language

23

"knowingly violate regulations" to suggest that you have to know

24

what the regulation is.

25

evidently is the Appellee's position and which was the position

But we think that the position which

7

t

stated in a concurring- opinion by Judge Magruder in the St,

2

JOhnsbury Trucking case 3 which was a leading early Court of

3

Appeals decision on this matter* that the use of that language

4

justifies a distinction,

5

a proper reading it places

0

on semantics,

Wa don't believe that that* if that's
coo much emphasis in the abstract

The — of the practical reality which w@ feel

7

makes it perfectly clear that the use ©f the phrase "knowingly

8

violates regulations" in this case is simply a shorthand.

9

fact* there are some cases in which Congress has* on rare

In

?©

occasions* indicated that an ignorance ©f the regulations or

1?

lack of knowledge ©f the regulations would be an excuse. It

12

would fee an affirmative defense and it stated that quite plainly

here.

The issue in Boyce is whether a regulation is

s

vague and the regulation involved dealt with the routing-of

4

tracks through congested areas and it required that the trucks

5

be routed "so far as practicable , " and that was the key lan­

6

guage in that ease as far as the vagueness is concerned,

7

far as practicable to avoid congested areas *13 such as funnel.3

and the defendant in that ease had routed its tracks through

X think it wouldebe a defense„ Your Honor,

That would be a claims 58X didn’t know what X was shipping?"
and X think it would be a question for the jury as to whether
to believe that.

These cases usually are baaed ©n largely on

documentary evidence so you would have the shipping paper and
be able to see what he put on the shipping paper and he had a
very strong case if he had olive oil written on the shipping
paper? that that’s what he thought it was.

It would foe a hard

case for us to prove although we might not indict, in such a
situation,
X was advised very recentlythere was a case where
the Government decided not to prosecute in which the employee
had gotten a wrong number on the truck.

He had hitched his cab

up to 1191 instead of 1157 or something like that and the
Government decided they wouldn't indict.
Situations like that might very well provide
defenses at trial.

But we don't believe that has anything to

bear on the nature of the elements that the Government must
23

allege in the indictment.
24
There isn’t any legislative history in the very
25
11

f

early provisions dating back t© around 1908 regarding what

2

Congress meant by using "knowingly" in the statute.

3

however, when Congress made other changes in the statute it

4

did consider changing the ''knowingly” requirement.

S

In 1960,

The Interstate Commerce Commission wanted to make

6

this a statute imposing absolute liability.

7

that defense ©£s "X thought I was shipping ©live oil"would not

8

be a good defense? that, the shipper would be absolutely liable

9

for what was in ‘that truck, regardless of what he thought it

In other words,

10

was.

11

They both rejected that position but the Senate did -- a bill

12

was introduced in the Senate which would have taken "knowingly"

13

out ©f the statute and substituted for it the phrases "Whoever

14

being aware -that the ICC had formulated regulations for safe

15

transportation for explosives and other dangerous articles.”

This was suggested to both the Senate and the House.

The House then deleted that phrase and put

We believe that the most consistent

reading ©f that case, the best reading of that case is that it

The St. Johnsbury case, in the concurring ©pinion,

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HAROLD E. SPENCER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

15

MR. SPENCER:

16
17

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The sol© issue in this case is the sufficiency

18
19

of the inf ©mat! on to state an offense ©gainst the United

20

States under Section 834(f) of Title XVIII.
Our position with respect t© that issue can be

21

22

very briefly stated in three propositions: first, the involved

23

statute punishes only one who knowingly violates the regula­

24

tion.

25

Second, to state an offense under the statute the

defendant must be charged, with knowingly violating the
16

1

regulation? and thirds the information here does not charge

a

the defendant with knowingly violating the regulation.

Therefore the Court properly dismissed the information.

reasoning was correct.

Now, 1 don't com© to the question of proof? 1

My only point her® and

the only point involved here is the sufficiency of the infor­
mation and it is ©ur contention that he must b@ charged with a
knowing violation of the regulations.
Now, the Government argument deals with the mean­
ing of the terra “knowingly."

They have a long argument In theifr

ment is sufficient.

Your argument, of necessity, assumes ®

Q

That’s what the Government is complaining

4

about here is they never had a chance to get into the proofs,

even though the charge follows, tracks the statute.

8

Q

9

That is not correct.

I thought Justi«3® White’s observation made

that pretty clear.
A

10

1 don’t believe so, Your Honor, and

11

certainly the decision in the St. Johnsbury case makes it clean

12

the necessary implication @£ the voice tap® makes it clear?

13

.Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring ©pinion in the Freed ease, 1

14

believe it was, makes it clear that there is a distinction

between the terms.

16
17

What about what Justies Holmes and Judge

They didn’t address themselves to that

Y@s, they did.

No, Your Honori they did not.

subject.

The

Government’s argument necessarily comes down to this proposi­
tion that there is no difference between the. statute which says ;

24

whosoever knowingly doesn * fe act in violation of the; regulation

25

is guilty of an offense and a statute which sayss whosoever

21

5!

knowingly violates the regulatio»'is guilty of an offense.,

Th© Government says that tills Is typical language? that £t°s

standard language.

language ©f 834 is different from what Congress used in 832 anc

833 @£ the siasie statute.

sent wants and th© Congress knew what it was doing when it

7

mads that distinction.

8

different in Section 834 from the requirements in 832 and 833.

9

And it certainly knew exactly what it was doing when

10
11

It isn't typically standard at all.

Th©

That's th© language that the Govern»

St read the scienter requirements

it did

that.
The thing that the Government wants to do is 2

12

they want to take, the word "knowingly” out of the place in th®

13

statute where Congress put if and put it somewhere else®. which

14

completely changes th© meaning ©f th© statute.

15
16

The Government — it isn't a question ©f proving
I think the Government is wall aware of the fact feat if the

17

statute mesas what it says and they have f© charge a knowing

18

violation they probably can°f prove it in this case.

19

Mowg with respect to — 1 also have the three

20

points which, Mr. Dienelt had with respect to the argument: the

21

meaning ©£ the words? the judicial interpretations and the

22

legislative intent.

statute? this is not standard terminology.

I had just finished discussing the wording of the

statute.

Before I get into the legislative history I would

&

like fco spend a few minutes with respect to the Boyce case and

9

the St. Johnsbury case.

10

In the Boyce Motor Lines case they held that the

n

statute in question punishes only those who knowingly violate

12

the regulations.

13

intent is a necessary element of the offense.

14

that the Court did not discuss the question of knowledge, which

15

is true„ because that question was not involved in the case.

IS

However, the presence ©f a culpable intent cannot be squared

17

with the wording of the information which the Government wants

18

to us in this case.

That is a question for

the trial* but that does not mean that the Government does not

8

have to show the offense set forth in the statute and to con­

9

fine its proof to the offensa set forth in the statute»
Mow* in the ;St. Johnsburv case the Court- of

m
11

Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the District Court's

12

finding of guilty ixnder this statute and said that the Court

13

had erred because it found that there was no element of culpahl ■e

17
18
19

20

And in Chief Judge Magruder5s concurring

opinion in that ease he took up this very point and he ex­
plained the difference between an act knowingly done which
happened to be in violation of the regulations and -the knowing
violation of the regulations and he made that very clear and
says it depends on how the offense is defined by Congress
because it just makes it hard for the Government to prosecute
the cases.

It's up to Congress to fix it because the?/ can

define the offense.
Mow* I. think if those cases are not. the answer to
this, the legislative history to the 1960 Amendments is con­
clusive because a commission* which at that time had

They have since been

various amendments to this act and among them was an amendment
to delete the word “knowingly" from what was then Section 835.
It is the same section which is new 834„

9

The Senate in the 85th Congress noted that

10

deletion of the word “knowingly" would create an

liability for a violation ©f the section, and the Senate said: f'

12

there was a noncomp1iance with the regulation.

The House Committee on the Judiciary noted that the Senate9s

language created an almost absolute liability.

Committee said, “Thera are judicial pronouncements as to what

15

constitutes a knowing violation under the present act," and the t

could not possibly have been anything except a reference to the

Boyce and the St. Johnsbury cases.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. DIENELT* ESQ.

a

Thank you Mr. Spencer.

ON BEEMsF OF APPELLEE
MR. DIENELT %

9

' .

I only have about two brief points.

First* with respect to this language my point is

10

IS

that it5® standard terminology which is used in numerous

12

statutes.

13

which deal with the Federal Power Commission* the Federal

14

Communications Commission, the Secretary.- of the Interior9s

15

jurisdiction over conservation and there are numberous other

16

acts.

17

a certain ambiguity by use of the phrase "knowingly violates

18

regulations*3 to read it in the abstract* the fact that it*s

19

used s© frequently means to us that there is no moans by which

20

Congress has adopted a shorthand to incorporate

21

that are validly promulgated by an administrative agency.

22

We have cited statutes at footnote 1 of ©ur brief*

And* although we are willing to agree that there may be

regulations

With respect to Section 823 and 823 of this act*

23

it -- those are situations in which Congress was able* or felt

24

itself ®bi© to put in part of the conduct in the statute

25

itself* rather than delegating certain responsibility.
32

1

Q

What is your view of what --

2

A

Well, that was our second point»

Our

3

position is that it just isn’t clear enough as to what Congress

4

meant when it revised -the statute, that you can’t get enough

5

guidance with respect to what Congress intended to impute to

6

them that there was an intent to override what we consider to

7

be a fundamental proposition that ignorance of the law doesn’t

8

excuse its violation.
Tfe© Interstate Commerce Commission’a justification

9

1©

which Mr. Spencer referred to, which is quoted in the appendix

u

to his brief, referred to -the Commission’s view that the

12

reference to culpable intent had been relied upon by the

13

defense attorneys and to some extent by Courts in requiring

u

establishment ©f some — element or affirmative intention t©

15

evade the law, in addition to knowledge at the facts.
This, we think, emphasises that even the Interstate

13

Commerce Commission wasn’t absolutely clear on that? it felt

17

'■■■

18

that there was a difficulty and it wanted to create absolute

19

liability.

20

been much more helpful to it in terms of eliminating knowledge ;

I submit that, the absolute liability would have

©f the facts.

21

22

In other words, eliminating the requirement that

the defendant had to know that he was shipping sulphuric'acid,

.

23
24
25

for example.
tod, we think that by the same token it’s possible
to read the language that the Senate substituted; "Whoever
.13

I

being aware that the regulations had been formulated^" and

2

referring somewhat ironically# perhaps# to knowledge# but not

3

knowledge of the facts..

4

In other words you haw a. situation where the

5

Government would# at trial# have to prove a general awareness

6

by the shipper or carrier of knowledge of the regulations# but

7

no knowledge at all, absolute liability with respect to the

8

facts,

9

And that brings me to the third point and that

'10

iss we don31 intend to say here that there isnd'fc a defense of

1!

a mistake of fact? I think 'that8® for the jury,

12

necessarily in these cases# depends to a large extent ©n in~

13

ferring from Congress knowledge of a failure to comply with

14

regulations.

15

counts in the indictment,

16

counts and we would ask the jury to infer from that knowledge

17

of the facts.

'18

For example, in tills Case we have alleged five
