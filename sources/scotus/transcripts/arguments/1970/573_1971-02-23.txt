ARGUMENT OF CHAREES E. MINER, JR„, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

8

MR. MINER; Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.

10

In February of 1968—--

n

Q

.Would you mind raising your voice a little,

A

In February of 1968, we in Florida under­

12
13

please?

14

went a rather disquieting situation when, in our public scholis

35

roughly % of Eloridas public school teachers went out on what

18

they termed a period of resignation. They blamed insufficient

17

state support to the public school systems for their determin­

18

ation to do this.

19

The legislature was responsive to the plea of the

20

teachers for increased state funding and went into, at the

21

call of the governor, an executive session to remedy as best

22

it could at that time the inequities in pvblic school finan­

23

cing that existed at that time.

24
25

As a portion of the legislative amendments that were
passed in February of 1968, the so-called Millage Rollback Act,
5

1

which is the statute that is before the Court for determination,

z

was enacted»

3

Simply stated, the Millage Rollback Act told to each

4

county that regardless of whether or not the people within

5

your county vote for you for public school operating purposes

6

in addition to 10 mills, you must roll back the 10 mills, and

7

when you do so, we will then guarantee you additional state

8

funding in the amount of at least $1,000-

9

Now this is the statute that is under attack<> Appelle-

10

as contend that it denies to Florida schoolchildren an equal

11

economic educational opportunity, which they say is required

12

by the 14th Amendment,

13

Q

Mr, Miner, where does the state, as such,

14

get its funds to make up the $1,000 you referred to, does

15

Florida have an income tax?

16

A

No, sir»

17

Q

Do they have an inheiritance tax?

18

A

• The sources of revenue — no, sir — the

19

sources of revenue are the sales and use taxes, gasoline tax,

20

etc», primarily the sales tax is the source of Floridas reven­

21

ue»

22
23
24

25

Q

Does any share of the property tax go %o

A

No, sir. As I will expand into this argument

the state?

a portion of the property tax, a certain millage figiare, is fig-

6

1

ured into the state funding formula£ it doesn not come into the

2

state as such*

3

The Millage Rollback Act set a 10 mill cap, in effect

4

telling the connties you '«ill not levy in excess on 10 mills

5

if you want to participate in minimum foundation funding pro­

6

gram.

7
8

Q

that-—. Maximum it means, doesn't it?

9
10

What does that word "cap" mean? 1 notice

A

Yes, sir*. There were certain exceptions to

the 10 mill cap but it——

11

Q

12

A

-“-means maximum of 10 mills.

13

Q

for what, school busses, and for what, new—

14

A

Capital outlay,

15

0

Yes. But what does the word "cap" mean? I

16

find it throughout the briefs and that word—
A

n

18

I see.

The 10 mill limitation. It3s

popularly re-

ferred to in Florida, or unpopularly referred to in some circles
t

!9

as a "cap" meaning—

20

Q

Meaning what?

21

A

Meaning a maximum of 10 mills.

22

Q

Yes o

23

A

Yes, sir,

24

Q

1 see.

(immediately following, by another Justice)

7

i

Mr. Miner Mr. Miner, there is a lot of: talk in the

z

briefs, too, about counties taxing themselves. The voters vot­

3

ing to tax themselves. I suppose what it really means, trans­

4

lated, is that ifeSs taxing the property there. Might as well be

S

corporate property?

6

A

No, that is real --- or real property.

7

Q

Real property.

8

A

Yes, sir. Real and tangible personal pro­

10

Q

Might be owned by a non voting corporation.

n

A

9

perty.

' That's right, it's owned by individuals,

12

citizens, it's just a real property and the tangible personal

13

property in a given county.
Q

14
15

So it9s a bit ©f a euphimism to say that the

voters vote to tax themselves--a

We are taxing the property within the coun­

18

Q

OK, real and tangible personal—

19

A

Yea, sir?

20

Q

The non-exempt property.

21

A

Yes, the non-exempt property, we have—

22

Q

And if you say personal property also?

A

Well, there is a constitutionallimitation

16

17

23
24
25

ty.

:on the amount of personal property that can be taxed, a con­
stitutional limit, and Florida has a $5,000 homestead exemption,
8

1

2

so that homestead exemption, that $5,000 conies off the top,
Q

One more question and I911 stop. Could Flo­

3

rida remove constitutionally the county power to tax? Do you

4

think, and take it on to—-

S

h

Yes, I am of the opinion that they could.

6

Your Honor, they could, since it grants the taxing power through

7

its legialature, that X am of the opinion that it can identify

3

sources that can be utilered for public school financing and

9

we in Florida, in fact, do.so.

10

The public schools in Florida are financed as a part­

11

nership between the state and the county. The argument made

12

by Appellees

13

discriminates against the schoolchildren in Floridas property

14

poor comities, that is, property poor in relation to their

13

student numbers, would have great appeal if the public schools

18

in Florida were financed solely from local ad valorem taxes,

17

but that is not the case,

13

that if the operation of the Millage Rollback

What this 10 mill cap serves to do, or the 10 mill

19

maximum limitation serves to do, is to marrow tlia gap that has

20

historically existed in Florida, An example: Dade County, Flo­

21

rida, One mill of tax applied to the assessment rolls of Dade

22

county will raise$®9,0G and some cents per student.

£3

In Gadsden County, Florida, one of Floridas property

24

poor counties, it will only raise $8,21, In our brief we have

23

suggested that to unleash, as it were, the taxing power of the
9

1

wealthier school districts would be to magnify the very in­

z

equity that the Plaintiffs, or rather the Appellees suggest

3

that exists»

4

So, Florida has for some years realised that we

5

could not forever rely on the property tax in a given county.

6

We had to do something at the state level to infuse more state

7

dollars into public education——

8
9

Q

Because, basically because of the wide

disparities amoung counties with—

10

A

With socio—

11

Q

Well——

12

A

With socio-economic fact that some counties

13

are poor in relation to their student numbers and others are

14

rich, Glades county, the small county that I mentionedhas 144
•e >

15

students, Dade county on the other hand, has thousands and thou­

16

sands of students and this—

17
IS

Q

Wellwas the preceding in the Court.below

just on -the face of the pleadings?

19

A

Yes, summary judgement,

20

Q

No affadavifc

21

A

22

or anything?

Ho, there ware 2 or 3 affadavits submitted

at that time, Your Homor,

23

Q

Did you make this sort of a presentation in

24

the three-judge court?

25

A

Ho, sir, I did not. At that time 1 was not
10

t

representing the State Board of Education.

z

0

Well, for example, this interesting table

3

at page 11 - 13 of your brief. Was that information before the

4

three judge court?

5

A

6

Q

7

A

8

Q

This was included, Your Honor, because these

Well I would think that these are very re­

levant and significant——

1?

A

12

nificant—

13

Q

14

How is it before us, then?

facts at the time were not available to—

0
10

No, sir. It was not.

Yes, sir, they were very relevant and sig­

But. the argument you’re making could have

been made without the exact figures—

15

A

Yes, it could

have been madeO—

16

Q

And you could

have said what thepurpose

\1

of the legislation was—

18

A

Yes.

19

Q

What the consequences would be.

20

A

Yes.

2!

Q

Was it said?

22

A

I could not answer that,Your Honor,

because

23

as I say, I did not represent the State Board of Education at

24

that time.

25

If the Millage Rollback Act is considered in context

3-1

1
' 2
3

with other of the legislative enactments, the very reverse
proposition as asserted by Appellees is the case.
It protects £h® schoolchildren in Floridas property

4

poor counties by bringing, by narrowing or bridging the gap

5

that presently exists.

6

Appellees suggest that one way that we might finance

7

our public education is to give each student in each county a

8

given amount of dollars. In the reply brief that was filed in

©

this case, we suggested that that sum be $400 and as they re­

10

questing, the Millage Rollback Act—

u

Q

Per pupil?

12

A

Per pupil, yes, sir.

13

Q

Yes.

H

A

And——

15

Q

Who would give this,

m

A

Pardon me, sir?

a

Q

Who is to give the $400?

18

A

The $400 will come from the state. The

the state?

19

millage limitation, the maximum or the cap V7ili be eliminated

20

if the relief sought by Appellees is afforded.
Q

You mean you'd give $400 to Miami Beach?

22

A

This is only the state source.

23

Q

21

24
25

Well——

A

We are going to eliminate—

Q

Well — give the same amount to Miami Beach

12

1

that you'd give to the poorest county in Florida?

2

A

No, sir. This is what the Appellees suggest

3

might be done, and it might be constitutional, so I am taking

4

their argument and finding out just what might happen if we

5

did this.

6

But assuming that we would give $400 per pupil to

7

every pupil in Florida from state sources, assuming, then, no

a

10 mill cap, if we did this, Floridas richest county in terms

9

of its student population to its assessed value, would have

10

333% more money with which to educate its children than the

n

father in Floridas poorest county, Gadsden.

12

So the cap was simply a transitional equalising de­

13

vice , that was placed on local tax authority until such time

n

and it will be removed, it has been repealed, this very statute

15

.

has been repealed, effictive July 1, of 1974, at which time

16

in the wisdom of the legislature wa will have increased state

17

support to the basic funding unit of public education, that is

18

the instructional unit.
We will have increased it by 50% above what it is

19

20
21

22
23

today.
Q

So you think then, you would remove any

temptations to overtax property for school purposes?
A

Well, I think, yes, Your Honor, that the

24

voters are going to take care of that by themselves. With re-

25

gard to voting additional millage. We don't feel that there will

13

1

be any necessity for the cap at that time, because we willhave

2

funneled in such a great porportion of state monies that it

3

will not be necessary to levy any—
Q

4
5

One consequence of the mill limit «as to

redistribute the burden—

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

—even if it didn't reduce the amount of

3

per pupil expenditures below an acceptible figure, even if it

9

didn't do that, it did redistribute the burden of providing

10

that money.

11

A

12

burden, under—Q

13
14

That's right. The state has recognised its

Well, I know, but in terms of the state

doesn't have any money except what it gets from other people-

15

A

True.

16

Q

And so they redistributed the burden—

17

A

Right.

18

Q

Of educational expenditures and moved it

19

from some extent from prpperty tax to other sources of state

20

revenue*.

21

A

That's right.

22

Q

And from property holders to the people

23

who paid the other state taxes.

24

A

That's right.

25

Q

Yes. And then that, I gather is, that the

14

i

that the poorer counties now, get a much, this is your position,

z

get a contribution in taxes from other sources which enables

3

those poorer counties to give a better education—

4

A

Yes.

5

Q

—than they did when they had to rely——

6

A

That5 s right.

7

q

8

A

On local sources»

9

Q

——on local property taxes»

10

A

That1s right»

11

Q

Is that it?

12

A

Yes, sir. Instead of depending primarily on

““-primarily on--

13

as valorem taxes, local property taxes, they now, get in taxes

14

that are raised by use taxes or gasoline taxes, the ——, the

15

sources of taxes—

16'
17
18

Q

Well then why does Florida need the 3 years

to 1974 to accomplish this—
A

Because at the same time the Millage Rollback

IS

Act was enacted, there was a pledge in the same provision that

20

Florida would

21

least an additional $1,000 in state sources.

22
23
24
25

guarantee at least that particular year, at
• “

■{

Mow this Act was further amended in 1970 to provide
that for the next 4 years, ending in at the end of fiscal year
1974, that Florida

would infuse each year an additional $1100

per each instruction unit. And so that .’'at that time—

15

Q

1

a

And you have t© raise that by sometimes the

taxes, is that it?
A

Yes, sir.

4

Q

And you have—

5

A

Sales and use taxes.

6

Q

And you have the taxes already?

7

A

No

Q

Q

These are taxes to be made effective?

9

A

Yes, sir. Right.

10

Q

I see.

11

A

So that by that time the instructioal unit

3

. ‘

„

sir, these are projections.

12

which is the basis unit of financing in Florida„ will have ach-

13

ieved a worth of $14 „100 per unit., It is presently $9700 per

14

unit.. And at that time we feel that the state will have acquit­

15

ted itself of its responsibility to as nearly equalize as pos­

16

sible the economic educational opportunity for students.

17
13

Q

Now is instructional unit„ is that a

statewide concept?

19

A

Yes, sir. An instructional unit—

20

Q

Has been arrived at by some formula„ is it?

21

A

Yes„ sir„ a statutory formula conained in

22
23
24
25

the mirninum foundation funding program body of statutes.
Q

And this is supposed to be the amount re­

quired in order to provide state wide education of the same
quality throughout the state„ is that it?

16

t

A

Yes* sir* an educational unit* if Your

2

Honor*will permit* an educational unit* a typical educational

3

unit in Florida is one teacher and 27 pupils in the educational

4

situation»

S

Now that is the typical» Now the value of a given

6

educational or rather unit of identified need* or an instruc­

7

tional unit* it does vary» For instance* in exceptional children,

8

in the Florida school for the deaf and the blind* a typical

9

instructional unit is one teacher and 5 pupils»

10

And the value varies depending upon the time and

11

way of tiie teacher* so to speak*1 of the teacher who is teaching

IE

the unit* but on the average* the typical unit is worth* pre­

13

sently* $9*700»
Those units are distributed throughout Florida on an

14
15

equal basis. There is not* depending on the number of students»

16

You devide the number of students by 27 and put a teacher with

17

them* and that is an instructional
Q

18

unit»

Well I still have some trouble wondering

19

why you needed the 10 mill limit* becuase you5re going to do

20

a\fjay with it* because you won't need

21

gets-—

it* as soon as state aid

EE

A

To the extent* yes sir—

23

Q

1 don't know why you need the 10 mill limit

24

on during this transition period» Your could have left it off

25

and still built up the state aid and the local governments
17

i

wouldn’t have taxed themselves so much,

2

A

In direct response, sir, I would suggest

3

that the reason that it was put on there to begin with was as

4

the result of an overview that there had to be accorded to the

5

taxpayers in some of Flox*idas counties ad valorem tax
Q

6

relief.

Before they would put up with the new

7

taxes you were going to assess them?Going to assess for increa­

0

sing-*--

9

A

Tes, sir, I'd say in all honesty this was

10

a determination. But that was not the primary determination as

?1

far as the cap was concerned. We have long been concerned in

12

Florida with the fact that soma counties could raise and could

13

infuse local funds into their system, greatly in excess of the

14

ability of the other counties to do the same thing.

15

And while we were attempting to equalise economic

16

educational opportunities, it was felt that a cap would be a

17

prudent thing.

18

Q

You—

19

A

Nov? if you take the cap away-——

20

Q

You didn't need to limit the richer counties

21

to 10 mills, or the poorer counties to 10 mills in order to

22

bring up the poorer counties to a decent level.

23
24
25

A

If I may, sir, go back to one point, and

then perhaps I can respond more fully to your query.
The way that we arrive at bow much money is going
18

1

to be spent in the Florida public schools each year,, is done

2

statutorily, but identified units of need are first compiled.

3

That gives us a figure of how much education in Florida is going

4

to cost us this year.

5

The states are required as part of what we call local

S

effort, it's their local effort to levy at least for this year,

7

4 mills. Three or 4 this year. But whatever that amount of

0

money will .raise on the tax roll of that individual county is

9

subtracted from the additive, the units of need.

10

And the remainder there is what the state will be re­

11

quired to put into that particular county. As a part of the 1970

12

equalisation act, all counties, or rather it was mandated by

13

the legislature that the Auditor General of Florida to conduct

14

a so-called ratio study, to find out what the assessment pra­

!5

ctices were in several states.

16

Q

You mean they're 20% some places and—

17

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

And a hundred or 150 other places?

'19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

Do you mean

21

A

The counties. There

22

or

the counties?

has always historically

in Florida been wide variation in assessment practice.

23

Q

24

A

25

thestates

This is not—
— but there was also at the time the

Millage Rollback Act, or the following year, this review was

19

1

mandated and an attempt to find out who was assessing fairly

z

and who was not assessing fairly, because we had traditionally

3

rewarded those counties for bad assessment practices by giving

4

them additional state monies»

5

Q

Tell me, 1 take it, does this scheme mean

6

that by and large education is going to be primarily a state

7

operation rather than a county cooperation?
A

0
9

Yes, Your Honor, that is the direction that

•fje are moving in, in Florida.
Q

10

Well is there anything that says that you

n

have to make this limitation in order to get counties to give

12

up their autonomy in education? 3; mean, political decision,

13

or—

14

A

NO, sir, I don*fc think, I think it was in

15

part a political decision, I think it was a decision that was

16

made as a result of what we -feaw had happened to the public

17

schools in Florida with great dissatisfaction amoung our parents

13

and among our teachers, and it was this sad occurence that fo­

19

cused attention on the need for additional state participation

20

in the funding process.

21

22

Q

Mr. Miner, do I understand you correctly

that the unit consists of one teacher and 27 students?

23

A

That is the typical instruction unit.

24

Q

I would assume that in Florida there are

25

some places with more fchafi 27 students.
20

2
■3

A

I beg your pardon* sir?

Q

I would assume fchat in Florida there are

some classes with more than 27 students.

4

A

Yes* there are* sir.

5

Q

What happens then* on the allotment of

S

money?

7

8

In terms of the fact that there are

some

classes with in addition to 27 pupils—

3

Q

Most ©f them are laore than 27.

10

A

There are some* yes* I would say* but then

J1

there are a large number of instructional units that have

12

less than 27. The exceptional children* etc. This is simply

13

a state balance* a State average. This is a starting point.

?4

Q

Well* in the wealthiest county* which is

15

the wealthiest county?

«6

A

Glades* in terms of its pupil population.

A

Glades county.

19

Q

Well I'm talking about* which county owns

\

20

the most taxable* tangible and real property?

21

A

I would say Da.de

22

Q

I would think so.

23

A

Yes* sir.

24

Q

25

county.

Does Dade county have more money for school

per* pupil than another county in Florida?

21

1

A

Oh, yes, sir»

2

Q

All I’m trying to get is that I think for

3

what it's worth, that it is true in Florida as in every state

4

I know of, there are some counties that spend more on the ed­

5

ucation of children than other counties.

6

That3 s true.

7

Q

Isn't that true?

8

A

That is true.

9

Q

That's inevitible.

10

e

I think it is inevitible.

n

Q

And your equalisation plan, which has just

12

gone into effect is the states effort to equalise,

13

A

To

equalize—

.14

Q

To

break down this barrier.

15

A

To

equalize that money.

16

Q

And to break down this disparity.

17

A

Insofar as it is possible to do so.

18

Q

'19

A

From the state side.
In terms of the total funding of education

20

we are trying to provide each child what is as nearly an equal

21

economic education as is possible. But in direct response to

22

your question, in 1969 and 1970, in Dade county, the average

23

per pupil expenditure was $823.79. The state average was $728.00

24

So we recognize that it does cost additional money from county

25

to county and, rather within the state of Florida. That it. doesn ’t

22

1

cost as much perhaps to educate a child in Bradford county as

2

it does in Dade county.

3
4
5

Q

Well this depends on your practical factors,

the extent of travel and all that sort of thing**—A

Tes, sir. The transportation factor, the

6

number of students to be transported, obviously the number of

1

students within the county, the number

8

exceptional children programs. All the counties in Florida

9

do not have those.

10
11
12

Q

of counties that have

They would tend to be in the larger centers

of population.
A

Yes, sir. And also there are the inactive

13

areas, that are deriving funds on the public law 874, where

14

they have large military installations.

15

Actually' in Florida we are now spending about, or

16

rather the state is now funding about 56% to 57% of the cost

17

of public education. The counties are only funding 41% and the

IS

federal government perhaps 2% or #3%.

19

Q

Mr. Miner, let me be sure of one thing. Now

20

Florida isn’t aiming to the point where there will be no county

21

contributions to ■—-

22

A

No, sir. No, the law as it presently reads,

23

Mr. Justice, is that for the next ensuing fiscal year there

24

will be a 4 mill required effort on the part of the counties.

25

The next year 5, the next year 6, the next year 7. And all years

23

1

thereafter. Each county will be expected to raise at least.

2

7 mills, and that 7 mills will be figured into the state funding

3

formulas which is the equalising funding formula. That each

4

county will always be expected to maintain, to levy mills for

S

school purposes,
Q

6

And as I

understood you earlier, there is

7

also an equalization, so that this 7 mills on the $1,000 that

8

property ——•

9

A

Yes, sir, that is correct,

10

Q

There will be realized the same amount as

11

on the $1,000 plus property and--—

Yes, To equalize the impact of tax mill per

They can do what they will, becuase at that

time we will .have reached the goal that we have set for our­
selves,
Q

To the extent that they raise their mill

levy over 7 mills, the dollar per- dollar state aid is reduced?
A

No, you see, they're only required to levy

7 mills but they can levy, under the law 10 mills—
Q

Yes, but if they did—

A

They don't lose anything if they do, that

is money that we call the fat. They can pour that back into the

24

!

fills of the system if they like. But they are not required to

2

levy anything in addition to 10 mills.

3
4

If the voters vote additional millags and they want
to go up to 15 mills for the frills, they can do so.

didn't it?

Q

9

This went off on summary judgement, below,

Yes, sir.
I think you told us, Mr. Miner, that none

of the things that you have been argtalng today or this material

i<3

in your brief, apparently was submitted to the District Court.

tl

Is that right?

32

A

Wo, sir.

13

Q

Well, I’m just wondering.

n

Q

(Immediatelyfollowing,

15

by another Justice)

It isn’t right?

16

A

I beg your pardon?

17

Q

Isn't it right, that this was not submitted?

18

A

I cannot say exactly what was submitted to

19

the state court Your Honor.

20

Q

--- what is in the record, isn't it?

21

A

Pardon me?

22

Q

Don’t we have the record here?

23

A

Yes, sir. You have the entire record.

24

Q

Well my question was going to be is this a

25

question in the light that you put it te it, is that we ought

25

,

«?1

to try to deside here

2

that the judgement was inappropriate, in the circumstances,•

O
Cj

and have this done over, in the- District Court»

4

A

or just sand this back with the summary

There is also, in answer to your question,

5

sir, there is also in our brief, in the Appellants brief, a

6

prayer for abstention»

7

Q

Abstention?

8

A

Yes, sir, becuase there is a ease testing

9

10

11

the validity of this particular statute, the Mi11age Rollback
BkCt--- -

Q

Well, there again, why should we direct

12

that? If summary judgement was innappropriate here, and you

13

sought to go back to be re-done by the District Court, shouldn't

14

that --— an abstention?

15

A

Yes, sir, I was going to say in conclusion

36

to my argument, I was going torefer the Court to the argument

17

that we had made for abstention, I wanted to get as much to the

18

nerits as I could, and I have nothing further to add to the

19

argument that we have already made for abstention. Except to

20

say that the case that is testing the. validity of this vis a

21

tfis the Florida Constitution and the Florida statutes is still

22

a viable case» It has not been dismissed, although no action ha

23

been taken under it since November--—

24

Q

Are they different parties?

25

A

Pardon me?

26

1

Q

There are different parties?

2

A

There are different parties, yes, sir.The

3

questions are almost precisely the same.

4

Q

Are you Counsel in that case?

5

A

No, sir, I am not.

S

Q

The case has been dead, it hasn't moved

A

It hasn't moved along, yet it hasn't been

7

along--—

8
9
10

dismissed for lack of prosecution. Now the reason why it has
not moved along, I could not say.

11

Q

Where is it, in the Florida Trial Court?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

The Florida Trial Court?

14

A

Yes, sir. In the Circuit Court in (Forlean)

15

County.
Maybe the litigants there are waiting on

16
17

this case.
A

18

Yes, sir.

That's a possibility, isn't it?

ARGUMENT OF IIERSHEL SHANKS, ESQ .

3

Oil BEHALF OF APPELLEES

4

5

MR. SHARKS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court.

6

It's true, Mr. Justice Brennan, that in the reply

7

brief in tiiis Court, the Appellants have, I think, raised a

8

new justification for the Millage Rollback Act. However, we

9

feel that we're prepared to meet that here, and that itss not

10
11

necessary to sent the case back,
Tiiis is essentially a statistical case, and certain

12

things are necessarily so. The arguemant that they make here

13

for the first time in the reply brief, I think puts the best

14

light on the Millage Rollback Act that can be put cn it.

15

Previously, it appeared that the iiillage Rollback

16

Act had been passed as an obeisance to certain powerful pro­

17

perty interests, as a trade off so that they would support

18

legislation increasing state funding of education. Out argument

19

was that a. wealth discrimination, a limitation that discrim­

20

inated on the basis of wealth was an unconstitutional price to

21

pay for the increased state funding.

22
23
24
25

Q

Mr. Shanks, who are your clients, who are

the Plaintiffs in this case?
A

They are freeholders, parents, and students

from 16 counties who have been adversley affected by the Millage

2R

1

Rollback Act»

2
3

Q
adversly affected?

4

5

Sixteen counties , and haw have they been

A

Prior to the Millage Rollback Act, they had

voted to tax themselves, their property-- *

6

Q

7

A

Tax themselves and their fellow taxpayers—
That's correct. At a higher rate than is

8

allowed under the Millage Rollback Act, so that this is a two

9

year authorization, all that was needed was the vote of the

10

School Board to assess and levy---

n

Q

All that the popular vote did was to author­
i

12

ize the School Board to assess and levy-- -

13

A

That's correct.

14

Q

And your clients, the Plaintiffs, are they

15

from relatively rich counties, or relatively poor counties?
A

16

Well, 1 think that they, on the whole, are

17

from relatively poor counties, but I think that extends. The

18

question as to whether to not they go above the 10 mill limit

19

depends not only on how poor they are, or how rich they are,

20

but also on what kind of an effort they want to make, and if

21

22
23

24
25

they're poor, they have to make a greater effort, but sometimes
some

of the middle range counties may be willing to make more

of an effort, too.
But these counties all did tar, themselves at a higher
rate, before, fell back, as they are required to do by the Mil-

3

1

lage Rollback Act, and. in one case, the School Board

2

it couldn't produce a budget with the 10 mills, and—

said that

3

Q

That was Broward County, was it?

4

A

That's correct, yes sir»

S

Q

Isn't that quite a prosperous county? Quite

6

a rich county?

7

A

Personally I'm just not sure——

8

Q

— municipalities in Broward County?

9

A

Wo, I don't Your Honor.

10

Q

Fort Lauderdale—

11

A

I'm just not sure of the location of Broward

13

Q

Isn't St. Petersburg in it?

14

Q

No,

12

15

County—

Pinellas is St. Petersburg, this is

Fort Lauderdale?

16

Q

Yes, Hollywood, and Fort Lauderdale.

17

A

But our point is really a relative one, a--

18

Q

I was wondering how you, how the plaintiffs

19
20

are injured in terms of the equal protection clause.
A

Well, they are prevented, they are really

21

asserting a right of the county as in the same way as

22

Vo Sanders), where the disadvantaged voters were asserting the

23

right of the county» These people come from counties which have

24

voted higher taxes, and I think it's a fair assumption not only

25

in the case of Broward County, but in the case of other counties

30

in CGray

where they have been collecting higher ta&es and then they fall
back and they don’t fall back to, let's say, 9% or 9, they fall
back right to that limit»
Now I think it's a fair assumption that when you have
a higher tax rate that falls back just to the limit, immediately
after the limit is imposed that this limitation is an effective
limitation on what they would otherwise be doing»
Q

I just wondered, I had quite a good deal

of trouble conceptually, seeing an equal protection injury to
the Plaintiffs here, when what they complain of is the action
of the state in making every county equal.
A

No, that's not our argument—-

Q

-- 1 tillage Rollback on every county to 10

mills.
A

That's correct, and our

Q

And your people say that that denies you

equal protection.
A

That's correct. Our basic position is that

Q

You mean denying them the right to tax them­

a--

selves more than somebody else--—
A

That8 s correct.

Q

—-denies them equal protection?

A

That's correctYour Honor.

Q
s

They want to be taxed more, and the state
31

1

says they can!t. Is that it?

2

A

l8m sorry, Your Honor.

2

Q

I understand you to say

4

that these people

want to be taxed higher than the state will let them be taxed.

5

A

That’s precisely so.

6

Q

That’s what you said.

7

A

In other words they're willing to, I think

8

if we look at it as tax authorisation, that the state is actual™

9

ly giving, and if they give the rich family, the rich county

19

more than the poor county, than that is a denial of equal pro­

11

tection, and our position is that a ££at rate limitation, that

12

is, 10 mills, does operate unequally because, in the rich

.13

county it authorizes„ or gives to the counties an authorization

14

to tax themselves to the extent of $750 a pupil, whereas, in

15

the poorer counties it's limited to $50 per pupil.

16

Q

Well, regardless of what the taxes are,

17

wouldn't the child in the poor county have an equal protection

18

argument in consideration with the child in Palm Beach?

19

A

That raises a very important point, Your

20

Honor. There are two elements of disparity which I think con­

21

ceptually it’s important to keep in mind. Some of the dis­

22

parity between the child in Miami Beach and the child in the

23

pahhandle, results from the fact that the childs parents, or

24

the taxpayers in Palm Beach and Miami Beach can afford more.

25

And this case is not raising squarely that issue. That issue

1

is raised in the —-- and we discussed it in our brief, but the

2

other kind of unequal treatment is with—-

3

Q

4

Do you know of any state in the Union where

all of the schools are equal?
A

**

6

No, I don't Your Honor, and we're not con­

tending in this case that that must be done» We are simply
I

?l

asking for the same--—we’re not even imposing a limitation,

8

we're just opposing an unequal limitation so that aecross the

9

board limitations, we agree that that's constitutional»
