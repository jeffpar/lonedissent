ARGUMENT OF WALTER KIECHEL, JR», ESQ»

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. KIECHEL; Mr» Chief justice and foay it

10

please the Court.
This case comes from the Supreme Court of Colorado,

11

12

and presents 2 questions important to the proper administration

13

and conservation of the water resources of Colorado and nat­

S4

ionally.
First, whether Congress, by enacting the so-called

15
16

(McCaren) Amdnement, codified in 45 USC 666, intended to consent

17

to a suit against the United States for adjudication of its

18

water rights, in one of 70 water districts of the State of

19

Colorado.

20

And secondly, whether in the abaence of any expressly

21

stated intent to subject reserved rights of the United States,

22

two state court adjudication, such intent can be implied.

23

I plan to discuss preliminarily and briefly the na­

24

ture of water adjudication to the west and specifically the

25

proceeding here involving Colorado, then address the threshold

1

question of the application of the rule of this Courts opinion

2

in Dugan v. Rank, 372, US, holding that the consent applied

3

only to general adjudications, then discuss the legislative

4

history of the consent statute, and lastly, tha nature and

S

extent of reserved water rights and the ability of the state

6

courts of Colorado to adjudicate

them»

Historically, water rights were judicially determined

7
8

in the western states by a qui&t title action initiated by one

9

or more water users» The other claimants to water rights on the

10

stream system were joined, each party affirmatively presented

1!

its claim and contested the claims of others.
And this proceding resulted- in a determination by

12

13

quantity and priority of the rights of the parties inter sese.

14

There has developed, in most of the western states, statutory

15

modifications of this proeeedure, whereby the State Engineer,

16

or some other official, initiates the proceeding and presents

17

the evidence in first instance, but in essence, it remains the

18

same»

19

A determination by the Court of all the rights of all

20

the parties on the stream system inter sese. This proceeding

21

was initiated in 1967 in Water District 37, which, at that time,

22

was one of 70 Water Districts of the State of Colorado. These

23

Districts are established on watershed

24

being the watershed of the Eagle River, the Eagle River being

25

a tributary of the Colorado River.

5

lines. District No. 37

1

This was a supplemental proceeding,, there being a

2

number of adjudications in Water District 37 over the years.

3

The first one over 80 years ago* and the last one as recently

4

as 1966* the year before the instant proceeding was initiated.

5

Now a significant attribute of a supplemental proceed­

6

ing under Colorado law* is that the earliest priority decreed

7

in such an adjudication must be later than the last priority

a

date decreed in the preceding adjudication. Or stated other­

9

wise* ail rights awarded in a new supplemental proceeding* such

10

as the one before the Court* are necessarily junior* by oper­
ation of Colorado law* to those decreed in previous adjudication;!.

12

This supplemental proceeding was initiated by the

13

Colorado River Water Conservation District* which asks for an

14

adjudication and decree of certain of its claimed water rights*

S

other claimants appeared* and the Conservation District sought

16
17

to

join the United States as a party.
The United States moved to have itself dismissed*

18

asserting* among other things* that this was not the type of

19

proceeding to which this Congress has consented. The motion was

20

denied by the Sisfcfict Court of Colorado for Eagle County* and

21

the United States sought a

22

rado to prohibit the District Court from asserting jurisdiction

23

over the Supreme Court of Colorado determined that the motion

24

to dismiss was properly denied and rendered an extensive opinion

25

in which it held first# that

-sVobs the Supreme Court of Colo­

Congress had intended to include

6

1

the water adjudication proceedure of Co3.orado among the suits

2

to which it had consented.
Secondly,, the Colorado Supreme Court had held that

3
4

notwithstanding this Courts interpretation of the consent statutis

5

in Dugan v. Rank, that the statute permits joinder of the United

6

States in a supplemental proceeding involving only a tributary

7

watershed.

a
9

With respect to reserve water rights of the United
States, the Colorado Supreme Court strongly suggested that

10

the United States had no water rights in Colorado, except those

ia

arising under state lav».
The court said that the decisions of this Courts in­

12

13

cluding

!4

indeed, the Colorado Supreme Court said that the only decision

15

that might be determinative of this question was one of its

16

own, and that if it, the Colorado Supreme Court, determined tha

17

that the United States has reserve rights in Colorado streams,

?8

that that decision would, that determination would require the

19

overruling of its previous decision.

29

Arizona v. California in 373 US, were not determinative

And in that previous decision, upon which the Colorado

21

Supreme Court relies, and refers to in the course of its op­

22

inion, the Colorado Supreme Court had said that by admitting

23

Colorado into the Uni&n:,. with a provision in its Constitution

24

declaring unappropriated waters within the state to be the

25

property of and subject to approporation by the people of the

7

1

state, that the United States lost any rights to assert water

2

rights in Colorado, except those acquired by appropriation

3

subject to state law.
And in its ultimate holding, here for review, the

4

S

Colorado Supreme Court held that whatever water rights the

6

United States has , such rights , including reserve rights, can

7

be recognized and adequately adjudicated by the Colorado Distric::

8

Court.
Q

9

The Colorado Court didnot undertake to de­

10

cide whether or not the United States did or did not have

n

reserve rights, did it?

12

A

That is correct, it did not.

13

Q

Is that question necessary to reach in this

(ft

Yes,

H

case?

15

Your

Honor, if the, with respect to

16

the Congressional intent of the application of the consent

17

statute, it is necessary to decide whether those rights were

18

included within the

19
20
21
22
23

24
2S

enacted in

NcCarran
Q

waiveroof sovereigh immunity, that Congres
Amendment.
Now as a matter of construction of the

NcCarran Act?
A

Yes, ¥our Honor. And-- -

Q

Some of these water rights are rights of

appropriation, are they not?
A

Yes, Nr. Justice Douglas, that's quite

O

!

correct„

2

Q

The United States is an appropriated—

3

A

It is, indeedo

4

Q

Roughly what percentage?

5

A

I wouldn't know the percentage, the record '

6

of the case shows that many of the water rights of the United

7

States arise on national forests, and dfchose are claimed as

&

reserve rights.
Others are appropriative rights by other agencies

0
W

10

of the federal government. I suppose that the great majority

11

of the water rights claimed by the United States in Water

12

District 37 are reserve rights.
Q

13

Insofar as the statute is concerned A (2}

14

would seem to explicitly cover rights gained

15

wouldn't it?
A

16

by appropriation,,

Yes, sir. Yes, indeed, that is our position

17

that the statute was intended to cover the rights of-- • of

18

state law. And that was the specification of the terms of the

19

statute.

20
21

22

Q

Do I understand that you are, even so the

state court has no jurisdiction?
A

We say that because, with respect to rights

23

acquired under state law, this is not a general adjudication in

24

the terms of this Courts rule in Dugan v. Rank.

25

In that case, if Your Honor,please, it involved part

9

1

of the San Joachim River of California, and there the Court

2

of Appeals for the ninth Circuit had dismissed the United

3

States as a party, the United States having been joindd there

4

under the authority of the consent statute

5
6

Q

43 US 666.

Well that's(just a matter of who was a

necessary party.

7

A

No, sir it's a matter of the scope of the

8

proceeding to which Congress intended the United States could

0

join.

10

The Ninth Circuit had said, and I3m quoting from

II

this Courts opinion in 372 US 617,this Court stated that, "We

12

go directly to the question of joinder of the United States

13

as a party. We agree with the Court of Appeals on this issue

14

and therefore do not consider the contention at length."

IS

Now the Court of Appeals had said that the type of

16

suit Congress had in mind was a quasi-public proceeding known

17

as a general adjudication of a stream system.

18

One in which the rights of all claimants on a stream

19

system, as between themselves, are ascertained and officially

20

stated. And-- What's wrong with this particular proceeding

21

22

under that view?

23

A

It is—

24

Q

You think just because it presents —— ?

25

A

In part, Your Honor. It's neither a river

10

1

system,, a general adjudication geographically, not is it a

2

general adjudication with respect to having all parties before

3

the Court,

4
S

Q

river system, which you don't think it is,

6

7

A

Not within the contemplation of the consent

Q

Yes, but even with respect to the Eagle

statute.

8
9

Let3s assume that the Eagle River is a

River system, you think this is not a general adjudication?
A

10

No, Your Honor, Mr, Justice White, The

n

reason that I state it is not a general adjudication is that

12

not all of the parties are before the Court, having rights,

13

furthermore, the Colorado lav;, which bars the assertion and

14

decree, has not barred the assertion but has barred the decree

15

of any earlier rights, that is, rights earlier than the sup­

16

plemental proceeding, precludes the general adjudication.
It prevents a party joined in the supplemental pro­

17
18

ceeding in 1967 from asserting its priority of 1905, as many

19

of the rights djf the United States are in this case,
Q

20

Let's put aside reserved rights, let's just

21

talk about the United States appropriated rights. In the Eagle

22

River„

23

A

Yes, Your Honor,

24

Q

Do you still think the same thing?

25

A

The Supreme Court of Colorado said that

11

1

their lower courts have the plenary power to accomodate the

2

award of earlier priority as to, asserted in a supplemental

3

proceeding,

4

Q

In an appropriated right,

5

A

Well, they said it as to both,

6

Q

Well, let's-—

7

A

Your question is addressed to appropriated

8

rights, and I was responding to it. So that if the Supreme

9

Court of Colorado is correct, and they gave no specific direc­

10

tion or instruction to the lower court, they just said that,

1't

that the local court can accomodate, somehow, and modify or

12

ammeliorate this provision of Colorado law which says no priority

13

earlier than -the supplemental proceeding, then, if Water Dis­

U

trict 37 were a river system in the terms of the statute, then

IS

the state acquired rights, or the rights acquired under state

16

law could be adjudicated, in ray opinion, assuming that all

17

parties that had rights ware joined. All parties on that

13

river system.

19

And this is not the nature of this proceeding, Mr.

20

Justice White. I think that outside of the Colorado Conservation

21

District, that is one of the interveners, the zinc company,

22

and several other claimants, that certainly it's far from hav­

23

ing before the Water District Court, the Court for Eagle County

24

all the claimants in the Eagle system,

25

Q

Well that pretty well makes a shambles out
12
l

1

of the whole statute, doesn't it? In terms of consent. Can

2

you imagine one where at the outset that every single party

3

known to man might possibly be there?
A

4

That is

yes, I can imagine one, Mr,

5

Justice White. That is the traditional adjudication. That is

6

the way in which water rights in the West have been historically

7

determined, to have all the parties before it.
And I say that that was the type of adjudication

8

9

that Congress had in mind. This is very clear from the Senate

10

report which is referred to in the Courts opinion in Dugan v.

II

Rank. The Senate report 755, which was the report by which the

iz

Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably the McClaren Bill.
And that report shows unmistakably that it was this

13
14

general adjudication in which all parties were present, that

IS

was the type that Congress had in mind in their consent.
Q

16

But you're going also to our view, I sup­

'17

pose, that this isn’t a general adjudication because the Eagle

10

River is a tributary.

19

A

I do argue that, Your Honor.

20

Q

So to qualify to the statute you have to

21

have the entire Colorado River system?
A

22

I say that to qualify under the statute,

23

in this Courts view in Dxxgan v. Rank, you would have to have

24

all of the tributaries and the main stream of the Colorado

25

River-- ■

13

\

I

Q

And all of the people—

2

A

In the state of Colorado.

3

Q

And all of the people on the eastern slope

4

5
6

7

e
9

that are taking advantage of the Colorado River?
A

If they're claimants to water rights, on

the Colorado River, yes»
Q

Especially if somebody is claiming earlier

date, they'd have to have all of them, too?
A

If they are claiming rights to use water

io

from the Colorado River or its tributaries in the state of

n

Cplorado, yes, I believe that that is within this Courts decision

12

in Dugan v. Rank.

13
14

15

Q

There wouldnAt be a court room big enough to

hold the lawyers, then, would there?
A

Well, Mr. «‘Justice Douglas, water right ad­

16

judications are by nature prolonged, cumbersome, and multi-

17

party. This is nothing new.

18

Congress had this

1©

20

certainly in mind when they en­

acted the consent statute.
Q

But when some state comes along and attempts

21

to modernize its statutes and its adjudications to make some

22

sense out of them, do you think Congress, do you think this

23

consent just ends? this consent for just one single type of

24

adjudication, and that's it?

25

A

Wall, when you use the word one single type,
14

i

I would agree that

2

it is the general type, the historic type

the,of determinations judicially, of water rights which Congress

3

was consenting,,

4
S

Q

Colorado system is unconstitutional, do you,
A

6

Well you don't suggest that the present

I8m not making any argument to that effecto

7

But 1 was answering your question as to Congressional intent,

8

and I think that not only the Senate report, the discussion

9

on the floor, all of those things with respeet to the legis­

10

lative history of the

11

had in mind the traditional type of water adjudications, had

12

in mind rights acquired under state law.
©

13

Amendment show that Congress

If the United States is claiming water

14

under state law, purportive rights, and it v/ants to assert it,

IS

assert those rights, you nevertheless say that, the United States

16

can just sit back and use the water and until and unless it

17

wants to go into a court and establish those rights there's

18

nothing anybody can do about

19

A

it.

I say, if Your Honor please, that if the

20

United States is to be joined in an adjudication under the

21

consent statute, that the prerequisites of that joinder must

22

be satisfied by those who are joined.

23
24

-

25

Q

How about my question? Do you believe that

the United States——
A

No, Mr. Justice White, I don't think there's

15

I

s

any defiance by the United States.
Q

1'm not suggesting defiance, I'm just say­

3

ing that until and unless you want to go to Court you can j.ust

4

use the water.

5

A

Welly if we're talking about rights under

6

state law, still, and I would suggest that those Congress had

7

in mind could be adjudicated, in a state court.

8

Q

Well, yes, but—

9

A

And I responded to your earlier question

10

by saying that if the Eagle River were a river system, and if

n

the Colorado District Court could accomodate this bar date, that

12

I saw no reason why the United States couldn't be joined, and

13

be required to assert its rights acquired by appropriation

14

under state law, and be subject to the decree of the state

15

court o£ Colorado.

16

Q

Meanwhile the United States could just use

17

the water -— without anything more, until and unless

18

Colorado institutes a proceeding qualifying, under your statute

1©

the United States-—

20

A

Well, I'm not sure that that, there's no

21

lack of water adjudications past and in process in the state

22

of Colorado. The Water Colorado Conservation District sought

23

to bring the United States in this case so that it is a matter

24

at the instance of the Plaintiff, or the Petitioner, to join

2S

the United States, and if in the absence of joinder, or in the

16

i

absence of satisfaction of the requirements of the statute,

2

the United States is not a party to these proceednings, then-—

3

Q

Does the United States know what its claims

4

are, its appropriated claims are? Under state law? I suppose

5

it does,

6
7

A

Yes, they're many, and they have them

assembled, and X believe that the United States--i

e
9

10

ii
12

13
14

Q

Do you have any idea what reserved rights

you're claiming?
A

Yes, Your Honor, This is set forth in the

record of the case, and the record shows that——
Q

Would these reserved claims mean whatever

you may need in the future?
A

The reserve right doctrine says that the

15

quantum of the right is that amount of water necessary to £ui- i

16

full the purposes of the reservation, Arizona v, California,

17
18
19

Q

And that would be as far as you could go

in quantifying your reserve right chaim,
A

No, Mr, Justice White, they can be quanti­

20

fied, There is nothing saying that they cannot be quantified.

21

The record shows bn page—

22

Q

23

A

24

Q

25

A

Well, that’s all right,
X have the reference to the record——
That's all right,
It shows that the record, as I said in earl17

1

ier answer to Mr» Justice Douglas,

2

be asserted in Water District 37 are reserve rights on Rational

3

forests» But with respect to your question as to whether they

4

can be quantified, they can be quantified.
Q

5

that most of the rights to

Well when, if you win this case, how would

6

the United States plan to establish their reserve rights?

7

Just by, would you bring some proceeding-A

8

9

They are established, no, there would be

no contemplation of establishment, they are, by operation of

10

the doctrine and the rule of law, established by the creation

11

of the reservation, but as far as the quantification, consider­

12

able effort has been done to an inventory and catalogue of

13

those rights, and they are determined by amount and location—
Q

14

IS

But that would jtisfc be by administrative

action--

«6

A

Yes.

!7

Q

You would never anticipate subjecting, or

18

19
20
21
22
23

submitting those quantifications to a court.
A

Mot as party defendant joined under 42 USC

666, because we think there is no .authority to do so.
Q

Well, I understand that, but you would

never anticipate either yourself taking these claims to court—
A

There have been instances in.

which those

24

rights have been asserted affirmatively by the United States

25

as Plaintiff, but—™
18

11

Q

But in Colorado specifically, in this Dis­

2

trict specifically, you would have no plane to precipitate any

3

judicial proceeding to clarify the amount of your reserve right,

4

S

Well, when you say no plans, there is

5

considerable activity of inventorying the rights, the Department

6

of Justice made certain proposals to the public Land Lav; Re­

7

view Commission with respect to a means by which these

8

can be more, in a more orderly way, identified and quantified,

rights

9

Q

Administrated,

10

A

Wo, the proposals of the Department of

n

Justice which are reflected in the Public Land Law Rev lev;

12

Commission in its report shows that an administrative determin­

13

ation which would be subject to judicial review, but not

H

within this consent statute,
I would want to make one qualification of my earlier

15
16

question, which I do not change, that they can be quantified,

17

but. there .is always a certain open andedness or flexibility

18

to a reserve right because of the nature of it.
Inherent, in that right, is the need , or the re­

IB
20

quirement

21

the reservation. And that by definition includes a certain

22

flexibility in the right,

23

.to meet the purposes, to fulfill the purposes of

Q

Mr, Kiechel perhaps you said it and I missed

24

it, but let me ask you. Since the passage of theiicCarran

25

Amendment, has the government ever been in the posture it's now

19

1

in, in this case in a state court?

2

A

Yes, Your Honor»

3

Q

Where you've participated and not raised

4

jurisdic fcional objections?

5

A

Welly we are participating, have participated

6

in a number of water adjudication proceedings, in some, perhaps

7

all, we have raised certain jurisdic tional defenses, but they

8

have been, the problems in those instances, in other states,

9

1 might say, have been overcome and the United States had ad­

10

judicated and ha^ presented for adjudication its rights pursuant

II

to this statute»

Can we?

15

Q

How could you?

16

A

We can not. That is quite correct.

17

Q

But the Chief Justice has just asked the

18
19
20

question have you participated in some of these proceedings.
A

Well, there have been determinations, well,

we have, as I indicated earlier, as Plaintiff in the celebrated

21

(Colbrook) case in southern California, but with, in response

22

to yoffir question, Mr. Chief Justice, there have been determin­

23

ations by the State Court——

24

Q

With your consent.

25

A

Over our objection——
20

t

Q

Over objection,

2

A

That it was a river system. And in that

3

case there was not this problem of adjudicating and going back

4

and giving a true priority to our rights acquired under state

5

law .

6

In facti, 1 think one of the amicus briefs, the state

7

of Washingon,'presents its litigation program, a number of cases

8

that it has brought inthat state, in which the United States

9

has been joined pursuant to this statute. And they include

20

one of the decrees which shows that the state court recognized

n

the reserve" right, and decreed it, in certain quantity, with

12

the provision, a proviso that if at a later time there should

13

be additional heed for additional water to fulfill fehe purposes

14

of the reservation this was the contemplation of the decree,
Q

15
16

then is beyond the jurisdiction of the state court?
A

17
18

And your position from your standpoint

We took no appeal from that decision of

the lower Washington Coutt, Your Honor.
Q

19

I' know, but your view is --- that that

20

court was without jurisdication to adjudicate your reserve

21

rights,

22
23
24
25

A

Reserve rights were not involved in that

Q

I thought you said that the court did

case.

take, did recognize the reserve rights.
21

I

A

Yes, you're quite right, I'm sorry.

2

Q

Your position here, that that court had

3

no jurisdic tion to reach reserve rights,-'—»

4

A

That is correct.

5

Q

Even if you consented because you have no

6

power to consent.

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

But the Washington State adjudications

9
10

did

not entail the entire Columbia River system-—A

No, indeed, sir. They did entail what was

ii

determined to be a river system, the' Chillowist Creek river

12

system, but there was. not this problem in that case, in that

13

state of the bar date of the priority, and I might, say, Mr.

14

Justice Blackmun, in all candor, I thihk that the

15

States, and I want to admit that they have asserted reserve

16

rights in state court adjudications becuase

U

not spoken on this matter and until thcit determination is made

18

that an abundamce of

19

asserted, notwithstanding our position here.

20

United

.this Court has

as an advocate does those rights are

And I might say in further answer to your question

21

that we are very concerned about the statements of the Supreme

22

Court of Colorado which go at the existence of reserve • rights

23

in the state of Colorado. And we are asking this Court to

24

declare, to reaffirm the reserve right doctrine with specific

25

application

.to the state of Colorado.

22

5

Q

I don't see how we're required to do it

2

in this case*, even if we held for you. All we'd have to say is

3

if there were reserved rights there's no jurisdiction --- .

4

Aq

Well, if Your Honor please, the Supreme
il

5

Court of—-

6

Q

7

It would be easy for you_ to get the issue

here, if you wanted to, not easy for us, but—

e

A

Well, we've asserted—

9

Q

“-precipitate some litigation.

1©

A

We”ve asserted and made known those re­

is

serve rights, they are before the Court. Those are rights

12

which we will assert in Water District 37 if we're required

13

to proceed.

14

Q

15

I know, but if you win the case, that

reserve right is out of the case.

16

A

That's correct.

17

Q

And if

youi're worried about

that issue,

18

you, if you wanted to establish, why you could easily have it

19

established by an affirmative action, precipitating the liti­

2©

gation yourself.

21

22
23

A

I don't know how easily, but it could be

done as a party Plaintiff, yes.
The legislative history of the Act is common to both

24

of these cases, and I will treat it in the later case, as my

time has expired.

ARGUMENT OF KENNETH BALCOMB, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. BALCOMB2 Mr. Chief Justice
and may it please the Court.

6

My client., the Colorado River Water Conservation

7

District is a state organization, by statute, obligated to

8

protect the waters Of the Colorado River for the state of

9

Colorado, that is, the waters of the Colorado River and its

10

n

tributaries within the state.
And it was in pursuit of this goal that I, as Counsel

12

for the District, in the adjudication proceedings, in Water

13

District No. 37, caused the United States of America to be

14

served, because, as is indicated, they not only have substantial

15

what I would call rights under state law, but substantial rights

16

that they denominate as reserved rights„

'17

Now this Water District No.37, encompasses the entire

18

Eagle Eiger and its tributaries and is a rather substantial

19

stream. You might say small by comparison tb the Colorado River

20

as a whole, nonetheless, is a compact adjudicational admin­

21

istration unit.

22

It is, incidentally, included within the area that

23

is involved in the second case, No. 812, the Division 5 case,

24

by reason of subsequent Colorado law amendments.

25

Q

I wonder if it CQuld be disturbing to you if

24

1

you could state at least for my benefit in capsula form what

2

you concieve to t.& the issue»
A

3

I view the main and principle issue in

4

this case, Your Honor, to be whether or not the state courts

5

in state adjudicatory proceedures have jurisdiction over the

6

United States if they comply with the service requirements of

7 the Melaren Amendment„
B

Q

A question of jurisdiction?

9

A

Yes, sir... Which we deemed was

granted by

10

the Melaren amendment over the United States upon compliance

I!

with that Act»
As to whether you have to break this out, and 1 do

12

13

not believe you have to do, between the classes of rights the

14

United States says it claims, we do not believe this to be

IS necessary, because once you5re over the jurisdictional problem,
16

it looks like to me it was the intent of the Act to ceitch all

17

rights.
Otherwise, there was no point in joining the United

18
19

States at all. If they only have to bring in part of their

20

bucket of water, the balance of the bucket of water still being

21

hidden, the whole purpose of the

22

I believe.

Amendment is lost,

23

q

Your claim rests on the

24

A

The claim of jurisdiction does, yes, sir.

25

I would like to touch briefly, in at. least partial

25

Amendment?

i

response to some of the questions asked by Mr. Justice White

2

on just, exactly what an adjudication is under Colorado law.

3

And if I correctly understand the laws of the other

4

involved states, primarily the 17 western arid and semi-arid

5

states, Colorado has a really somewhat different system in the

6

balance, or had, at least, under the 1943 Act, and it was purely

7

judicial,

8

9
10
1?

— not an involvement of a state officer in it.
Nonetheless .it was a state sponsored or a, the Pac­

ific Livestock Case decided by this Court said was a quasi-jud­
icial proceeding, sponsored by the public, quasi-public.
At the time that the

. Amendment was passed by

12

1 would say, though I don’t know this precisely that of the

13

70 Water Districts z-eferred to by Counsel, probably all but

14

2 or 3 had already had but not. one, the original proceeding,

15

possibly had half a dosen others or more denominated supplemen-

16

tray adjudications.

17

And I juatdon’t believe it can be possible that

18

Congress intended in passing this lav/, knowing full well that,

19

all the states that it recognised had long had this type of

20

system intended to waste its time by passing an amendment which

21

would not allow the joining of the United States because the

22

proceedings were denominated as in this case supplemental.

23

Nov/ the subject matter of an adjudication proceeding

24

is not people, it is the river itself. The race is the water.

23

It is a kind of an action in rera, and it is a continuing action
12S

I

because its purpose is to establish in order of priority the

2

rights of those persons and entities claiming the right to

3

use water out of the particular stream involved.
So though you use supplementary when you start an

4
5

action similar to the one that was started in Eagle County in­

6

volved here, nonetheless,, in terms, in addition to, a contin­

7

uation of the original proceeding commenced in that county

8

a great many.years before, and serves as the method and the

9

means of not only quantifying the water right, but putting it

10

on the water rights ladder in its proper order.
And that is all, if I correctly read the Pacific

11

12

Livestock case, that any western water adjudication proceeding

13

does. It's established under the appropriation doctrine, it’s

14

attempts to establish a comprehensive expeditious, economical

15

scheme to provide for the fixing of water rights and their

16

distribution, it determines who is first and who is last,

17

it provides all the way through it for at least if not initially

18

in the final appeal to the court to establish all these rights.
Now, questions have bean asked

19

of Counsel for

20

the United States regarding of whether or not the United

21

States--

22
23
U
25

Q

was there a general adjudication prior tc

this proceeding --- water —- ?

A

Yes, thereewas, yes, sir. I drafted the

petition, I should know, but my guess would be as early as 1885.
27

I

And there were probably 10 or 12 supplementary

2

after that*

3

Q

4

to any of those?

n

13

I see, and has the United States been party

A

Not in Water District 37 to my knowledge,

Q

Although it had appropriated rights surely

YourHonor„

before this supplemental --- .
A

Yes, it did, but I doubt that they go back

prior to 1900.
Q

But they were, why wouldn't they have

been --- in supplementals?
A

Sorae of the supplemental proceedings that

14

were after the passage of the Mclaren Amendment? Well, it

15

wasn't until, as we view it, at least as I ---

16

Q

Your——

17

A

Sir?

18

Q

Ten or 12 supplemantals

19

Since 1885?

20

A

Yes, and more, I'm not even sure of that»

21

Q

Why was not the United States joined in

22
23
24
25

in this proceeding?

any of them?
A

Until 1952 they could not be joined, because

they had not raised sovereign immunity.
Q

Could now have, after1952?

28

i

A

I don't believe that the people of most

i

of the western states that were initiating, starting this

3

kind of a proceeding could have been particularly concerned

4

abaut this so called reserve right problem until this Court

5

announced that decision*

6

Q

How about appropriated rights? Apparently

7

there had aever been any adjudication of the appropriative

8

rights of the United States — —

9

A

'This is correct, Your Honor,.

10

Q

There has been some adjudication since

11

1952, in the state courts, why wasn’t the United States joined

12

in those proceedings?

13

A

Well, under the Colorado system, primarily

14

the person or the applicant delivers the adjudication proceeding

15

might not even be conscious of the

16

any concerts about the rights of the federal government*

17

Amendment or have

It is the people more interested in protecting the

18

over-all state rights who, after Arizona v» California, realised

19

that the government in Colorado could, if she pursued her ap­

20

proach that was used in Arizona v. California, dry up the river»

21

It’s just as simple as that»

.22

23

24
25

And so

they began then to be concerned and to worry

about whether the United States should be brought in»
Q

I take it that in the supplemental pro­

ceeding after 1952 brought by some person to establish his

29

fi

right, which I take it is what happened--

2

A

3

q

4

are not bound? Or not?

5

A

6

Yes, sir»
--“-people, other people who werenst served

Yes, they arebound» They

havelimitation

statutes that compel to be binding»
Q

7

If you 'win this case, would the United

8

States be bound by all of the supplemental adjudication since

©

1952?

10

31

A

I would say if Your Honor is asking me to

make a strict guess, that I would say no» I might observe that—

12

Q

Why nbt?

13

A

This problem is raised

by theUnited

States

14

itself , and not by anyone else. And citing the previous Ari­

15

zona V» California case, to the Supreme Court of Colorado, they

16

said we have never been a party in the action» The United States

17

says you can5t bind us until youhave been properly partied, and

10

therefore the prior proceedings cannot cut off the right of

19

the United States.

20

And as I understand the discretion of this problem

21

by Mr. Justice (Groves) of the Colorado Supreme Court. He was

22

reciting, in effect the position of the parties. He only made

23

one decidion for the Court, and that was that Colorado Conrts

24

are capable of adjudicating water rights of the United States

25

just like anybody else.

30

f

lie didn't reach the question of whether or not they

2

could add a prior decree but added that they probably could»

«3

A variety of questions he mentioned in passing but he didn't

4

necessarily reach them.

5

I«owf 1 would like to, if I could,, touch very briefly

6

on some of the cases in Which, in one way or another, the United

7

States has been involved affecting water rights on particular

a

streams in particular states, and whether or not they took

9

this attitude that they now take in this one.
If I correctly understand the Washington brief, I

10
i?

believe that I do, page 10 of the Washington brief, in re

12

Chiliwist

13

case to which Counsel has refferad. It is just one of nine

14

streams in which the State of Washington has caused the United

15

States to be joined, and their names would indicate to me that

18

they are certainly no larger or more prominent that the Eagle

17

River, in re Bonaparte Creek, in re Harvey Creek, in re Magee

18

Creek, and this kind of a matter, and in only one of those

19

does the United STates

20

a river system was involved, raised this before the United

21

States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington,

22

and apparently lost the matter on remand.

Creek in Okarmogan County is cited, and it is in

raise the question of whether or not

The other case mentioned by Counsel involves Utah,

23

24

there have been several there, the most principal case invol­

25

ving this

particular section is the in re (Griminer) case
31

1

decided by Judge (ChiIson) and the question there is whether

2

the United Stated Federal District Court had jurisdiction to

3

conduct adjudication

4

rather than this question of the stream system being involved.

5

for the benefit of the United States,

Wow we have kind of I beleive exhausted the brief

6

this problem of what the statute intended to cover at the time

7

of its passage, we think it very clear as has been indicated

8

by answers to questions here that it was intended to be allowed

9

if the Uneted States had one appropriative righton the stream

10

it
12

13

to join the United STates with any actions
Certainly as a minimum this is what the McCarran
Ammendment was intended to reach.
Q

Mr. Balcomb, I don’t believe I've heard

14

either Counsel as yet speak specifically of the language of the

15

McCarrar. Ammendment, and I have in mind the language reading

16

"Water rights by appropriation under state law by purchase, by

17

exchange, or otherwise." I’m interested in those words "or other

18

wise" unless unless you tell me that they are of no significance

19

whatsoever.

20

A

I believe at the time, Your Honor, that

21

this particular act was passed, this question about the util­

22

isation of the word "reserved" .in connection with water rights

23

was not in too common parlance. Wot even the government itself.

24
25

It had come up only as an implied reservation, in con­
nection with Indian reservations and was not considered to be

32

1

particularly serious»

2

I do think that it was the intention of the Congress

O
O

in passing the McCarran Amendment in utilizing the word "other­

4

wise" was to avoid a long listing of such things as condemnation,,

5

a variety of subjects and certainly was not intended by the use

6

of that word to exclude reserved rights, it wasr I believe,

7

intended to catch everything»
Q

8
9

So that you do feel the words "or other­

wise" have significance in the present context?

w

A

Yes , sir, and they certainly did at the

it

time in the mind of the Department of Interior witnesses who

12

testified as well as the Department of Justice witnesses who

1.3

testified who pointed out that this language that you're using

14

is a general waiver and if the

15

point all of our rights, our Indian rights, our military

16

rights, things of this nature, and they then did not call them

17

reserved rights, they were specific by naming those rights, and

?8

I think that the lawyers from Justice and from the Interior

19

Department show very clearly that they were concerned that the

20

waiver was too broad, and in both letters made the suggestion

21

that the waiver should be confined to state appropriativre

22

tights.

23
24

25

— will have to proove that

And as the Committee report

755 notes, they considered

this and rejected it. Considering that.the-—Q

Was there any particular episode that gave

33

!

rise, gave impetus to the statute of the McCarran Amendment?

2

A

.As I understand the legislative history,

3

Your Honor, it was a combination apparently, of circumstances

4

an inability in Senator MeCarrans home state to properly admin­

5

ister a little stream called the Quinn River, which had some

6

75

7

the government had purchased, there was the two pending eases

8

in the United States District Court, one of them which has

9

not been in judgement, concerning the Truchee and the Carson

rights adjudicated out of it, 3 of which

10

River and the rights of the Union, and the reclamation project

11

there, which apparently

12

There was the Fallbrook cases which thfe government

13

mentioned thet were bothering young Senator Mixon, and Senator

14

Roland, there was a variety of these kinds of things, even

IS

the Colorado Senators mentioned the problem that existed in

16

connection with the Blue River which has been pending in the

17

United States District Court < for the District of Colorado,

18

Q

Then the opposition to the legislation

19

came from the Executive Branch, the Justice Department,

20

the Department of Interior, it also came in the Congress from

21

such people as Congressman Moody, what would explain-—?

22

A

and

I think he, his warning to Congress of the

23

step that they were about to take exemplifies their thought,

24

that it covered all water rights, does not relate it to expense

2S

items which -- the government, or anything like that, it was

34

considered by the people who sponsored the absolutely necessary

into the field of water rights in the West,
And the ppposition from Congress came

4

from those who were concerned about the expense that might

5

be caused to the Justice Department?

You'd have to have a

District Attorney in every county in the western United States.

9

That's correct.

I might say 3/our suggestion of course well why
doesn't this Court give the justice Department and the

to

other federal agencies time to make a list and put it some­

tt.

where? — 1952 this was part of the legislation in rejected.

12

And they've hadllS years since then -— this suit vsas really

13

growing, and they haven't made the list yet, until they were

14

brought into Court.

I wanted to touch, if I might, briefly upon some

20

11 to 12 or 13 cases, at least that we've been able to find

21

the reported decisions, that relate to or refer to this

22

particular Section 666.

23

Counsel has mentioned the older one, I believe it has

24

bean in this Court for direct decision on it. There were 2 cases

25

at the time, that's Dugan v. Rank.

35

1

And I would like to call the Courts attention to

2

the fact that

3

the Ninth Circuit, or for practical matters,, any other court,

4

has held that 566 does not confer jurisdiction, that it was

S

not a quasi-public suit that was involved, it was a request

6

for declaratory relief, injunctions, sometimes an —— class

7

action, and the court said in every circumstance that is not

8

what's involved, becuase it is not the quasi-pvblic proceeding

9

called a general adjudication in

10

every time this Court of the Circuit Court for

And the only case that — reaches this point is the

11

very first one on the list, and that's the in re {Griminer)

12

case that Judge Christensen decided in Utah.

13

And he thoroughly discusses the legislative fhistory,

14

finds that it was intended that the United States be joined,

15

does not concern himself with a difference in kinds of rights,

16

but merely said go back to the state court, they have the

17

machinerey, I've noted that sometimes in an adjudication in

18

Utah they go on for years, and there are thousands of people

19

involved and the federal court just doesn’t have time to take

20

care of this.

21
22

It's got to go back to the state court that has
appropriate machinery„

23

I'd like to touch on another point, it is this atti­

24

tude of the government today and the attitude that has changed

25

oger the years at various times, and brings, I think, monumental

36

1

confusion for the other departments of the government that

don't know what to do. the

I think that the principle problem is is not whether

A

What is the derivation?

Yes„
I believe it commenced with rivers, and

progressed there through various Indian reservation matters

The reserved right question, to my. knowledge, has
not been reached in Colorado.
Q

And your idea would be that the reserved

right question is relative to anything else should be submitted

in a proceeding like is now before the Court, and that it

should go in through the state courts, you agree that's a

Subject to review here, and that's the

18

right of the government, if the Colorado Courts as they're

19

afraid will not follow the law, but I submit that I suggest

20

that the Colorado courts will follow the lav;,

21

and state law.

both federal

reserved rights,

23

it would extend that any federal court could get into it, I

24

gather under your submission. It woilid be only this Court

25

under review of the Colorado Supreme Court. If there were an

adjudication of a reserved right issue—

2

A

3

Your Honor.

4

Q

That9s the way I read the statute,, yes.

.Did your pleadings in this case*

■ take

5

the position or have your clients take the position that the

6

United States has no

reserved rights?

7

A

8

In fact as I give recognition to them , I only inquire

9

as to what the quality is, and what is the date.

10
11

Have 1 -- I have not. no sir.

Q

Do you think they're subject to date-? Do

you think they're subject to Ihe Colorado appropriation law?
A

12

Yes, sir. I don't think there’s any dif­

13

ference, just because you denominate legislation between that

14

and the — appropriations.
Q

15
16

So you don't think there's really any

reserved rights, that—

17

A

I don’t think—

18

Q

—that’s any different from appropriative

IS
20

uses.
A

That's correct. I think that the United

21

States would be entitled to the extent that it can show its

22

right to whatever date it was that they-—

23
24
25

Q

And it might be a right subordinate to some

other right, is that it ?
A

It might be subordinate to some, but came
39

i

into existence ahead of those rights of the United STates.

2

Q

3

A

-—it would be senior to the others.

4

Q

You. 're just saying that the United States

So you could™

5

either has appropriative rights in Colorado law, or it doesn't.

6

And reserved rights are no different from any other rights.
A

7

What Iem trying to say, Your Honor, is that

8

I recognise that the United States does hawe appropriative

S

rights

under state law,

and likewise has appropriative

«0

rights under federal law. ——you choose to call it reserved

11

rights under federal law.

12

Those are implied. They have to be found.

13

Q

14

cation in Arizona v

Do you agree or disagree with the adjudi­
Colorado, these so-called reserved, rights?

15

A

Do I agree with them?

16

Q.

Yes.

17

A

18

to quality, but I certainly agree withthe theory--—

19

Q

20

A

21

22
23
24

23

I don't know anything about the facts as

That's what I mean.
Yes, sir I don. I don't think 1 have very

much choice in that regard, anyway.
Q

Well, I mean is it a principle that, you

think would generally apply, in this litigation.
A

I think that---

Q

The point is that I'm after, is the setting
40

!

aside of the- Indian reservation carried with it implication

2

the right to use water, because otherwise you wouldn't have

3

a viable reservation.

4
3

We agree with that whole heartadly, Your
Honor.

6

Q

And yet I gather from what you answered

1

me earlier, it may be even as to those rights there are super­

8

ior rights.

9

A

Unquestionably if the Indian reservation

JO

were — on the forest was withdrawal in 1900, and there were

11

a variety of water rights acquired thereto, they would be like­

12

wise entitled to a priority date. That is the appropriation

13

system.

14
15

And you say reserve rights can't override

A

They can't go back at when they carae into

that?

16

n

Q

existence, Your Honor, that is what I say.

18

Q

But the governments claim is to the contrary

19

A

I don't believe so, no—

20

Q

You don't think so.

21

A

Mo, becuase the government's claiming 1905

Q

Appropriation right couldn't override a

22
23

not 1877.

24

reserve right? I mean the government sets aside and then the

25

appropriators come in. Sets aside a federal tract like the White

41

' 1

River course.

2

A

I agree with the position that the govern­

3

ment takes that they're entitled, to show their — - end go back

4

to it. Unquestionably. And to the extent that this takes out

5< :her appropriative rights I guess that's just the way the game
3

is played, but that3s the purpose of the syafeem.
But do you say that whan the government sets aside

7
8

a national forest or something else or a new Indian reservation

3

that it s appropriative right is limited by what it actually

10

is using then* or can the right expand as the need expands in

n

the

future?
A

12

I think I can answer the question in this

13

way, Your Honor, it was about

1897, I believe, that the

14

Organic Act set up the forests, and largely they were timber

15

reserves and they were spieifically for the purpose of timber.

13

Now I would say in that original withdrawal, this is

17

the purpose for which the water was drawn, and whatever the

18

United States could show it needed for this purpose, it would

19

be entitled to reserve.

20

Q

That's it?

21

A

Yes, sir. The 1360, I believe it was, the

22

act concerning multiple use of federal lands when they dumped

23

all these other things in on top of it as a purpose for the

24

forest.

25

And it might be a court would hold that as to some of

do

1

these rights the United States claims they would have to come

2

clear up to 1960„
Q

3
4

So the reserved right in your book would have

no open end?

5

A

No what, Your Honor?

6

Q

No open end. it would n!t be open

ended to

7

cover future need,, except to the extent that there was water

8

available.
!
A

9

1 can certainly understand that some of

10

them would be so deminimous that there would be no

point in

n

wasting time, but the governments in a better position to say

12

then We, what that's going to be. That's the problem.
I

13

Q

Nobody knows what these reserve rights are.

A

I think they don. Your Honor, they were

'14

q

15

perfectly able to list them in Eagle County.
Q

16
17

cond,

I know, but in terms of cubic feet per se­

is what——
They were able to do that there, also„

18

A

19

They spoke of the general reserve rights and then ,

20
21

spoke of these things that they were going to claim specifically
I

which as I view it is a double claim for the same——

22

Q

They have never been adjudicated, have

A

Sir?

Q

They have never been adjudicated, have

they?

43

I

1

2

they?
A

Noy sir. They have not

offered them for

3

adjudication. And that’s all we ask them to do, and all we

4

ask this Court to do, is direct them to do so.

5

Q

Is to do what?

6

A

To direct the government to offer its

7

claims for adjudication. And as is indicated, if the Colorado

8

courts, the Utah Courts, the

9

Court is still here to straighten that problem

to

Washington courts, go astray this

But I don't think it's fair to assume that state

IS

courts are not going to follow federal

12

specifically enjoined to follow it.

15

out.

Q

law. When they are

Well, then if they don't I suppose that

there are ways of dealing with that problem, aren^t there?
A

Yes, sir. If it's *--- I deal with variance.

16

What is right and what is wrong? Is it wrong to allow the

17

government to stand out here andwith this open ended mortgage,

18

or is it right to make them go ahead

■19

ed mortgage into court and declare their rights?

20

and bring that open end-

It's an equitable way to proceed, as I view it.

I

21

might mention, that my time is about to expire, that there is,

22

I will have an opportunity, of course after

23

speaks concerning 1812, that there is an amazing similarity

24

between these cases, and I think that the result probably

25

should be the same.
