ORAL ARGUMENT (Continued) 3Y DONALD P.

OOSTERHOUSE, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. OOSTERHOUSE:

It

*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
i

S
9

Mr. Dewey has been working at Reynolds Metals
Company since the District Judge ordered him reinstated to the
l

10

present date.

II

Reynolds Plant was in November of 1963.

12

The last time Sunday work was scheduled at that

The statuto involved in this ease* the Civil

?3

Rights of 864* Section 70381* deleting the material not bear­

14

ing on religion would say: “It shall be an unlawful employment

15

practice for an employer to discharge any individual because

!6

of such individual’s religion.

17

The clause in the entire section, “or otherwise feo

18

discriminate against," I believe defines discharge for

19

religion as discrimination.

20

broad in prohibiting discharge for religion.

21

And thus the language is rather

While religion is difficult to define precisely, I

22

think there are at least '.two elements always present in that

23

they are beliefs on the one hand, and conduct falling Out of

24

these beliefs ©n the other.

25

Q

Well, does anyone challenge that issue here
3
I

!

fco be —

Z

A

I don't think it’s challenged. Your Honor.

3

Except in the Chamber of Commerce brief, they would interpret

4

the statute to cover and protect naked belief only, rather

5

than conduct.

6

This Court has applied the Civil Rights Act.

1 am

7

thinking particularly now of Griggs against Duke Power which

8

was decided March 8th of tills year.

9

the face of the rule or even the uniform application ©f the

10

And the Court said that

rule is not an adequate matter for investigation.

Quotes

"But Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the

11
12

consequences of employment practices, not simply the motiva­

13

tion.”

14

constitutional free exercise of religion also in such a case

15

as Sherbert against Verner and in Barnett, where it is the

16

effect of discrimination, rather than the face of the rule

17

that counts.

18

Q

This, of course, followed the Court's doctrine in the

Well,in the Grigs case wasn't that impact

19

discussion, that is judging it by its impact and effect, tied

20

in with the situation in which there has been a long history

21

of discriminatory employment practices?

22
23
24
25

A

Isn’t that so?

Y@s, Mr.1 Chief Justice; this is correct.

That case involved that kind of a fact situation.
Q

But, do you claim any long history of dis-

criminatory practices against religious beliefs in this case?

4

!

A

Ho; we do not.

But we do claim that the

2

language which this Court used in Griggsis broad enough to

3

cover more than the bare fact situation in that case; that the

4

approach to this act is to look at consequences of discrimina-

3

tion.

6

Reynolds' defense that this rule of required over­

7

time applied uniformly to all people? whether they had

8

religious objections to working on Sunday or not? we claim?

9

therefore? is not an adequate defense because the effect of

10

this rule is to put a person with Dewey's religious beliefs

11

to a choice that no other employee is put to? and that is 2 of

12

either sacrificing his job or sacrificing his religious con­

13

victions „

14

It was precisely this kind ©f & conflict which

15

this Court disapproved of in Sherbert against Verner even

16

though that was under the constitution? I think? the principle

17

of interpretation is applicabis to the conflict between

18

religion and employment under the Civil Rights Act.

19

The Commission charged with enforcement ©f this

20

act has adopted regulations and it has? by the regulations?

21

adopted an intermediate interpretation of the act.

22

cated before? the Chamber of Commerce brief would have us

23

apply the protection of the Civil Rights Act only to belief?

24

not to conduct flowing from that belief at all.

25

As I indi­

The language of the statute itself is very broad

in prohibiting discharge because of religion without any

In this case the accommodation which is required

whatsoever of undue hardship in Dewey's situation.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LAWRENCE G. WALLACE9

7

OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL OH

8

BEHALF OF THE' UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

9

Mr. Wallace.

10

Mr-. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This is the third case under Title VII of the 1964

11

12

Civil Rights Act to be argued in this Court.

13

cases were decided earlier this term.

14

cos$>laint had bean acted upon by the Equal Employment Oppor­

15

tunity Commission prior to the filing of the suit as the law

16

requires.

17

forcement powers of that commission and the powers of other

18

Federal agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board

19

and the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Equal Employment

20

Opportunity Commission was not a party to any of these three

21

suits in the Federal Courts to enforce Title VII.

22

The first two

In all three cases the

But, because of statutory differences between en­

Since wa believe that this Court’s decision in the:

23

case are in many ways as vital t© the work and the responsi­

24

bilities ©f the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as

25

this Court’s decisions under the statutes other agencies
8

1

administer or to those agencies and since the Attorney

2

General also has important statutory responsibilities for the

3

enforcement of Title VII the United States filed an amicus

4

brief in each of the three cases and asked to participate in

S

the oral argument in each of them.

6

cases* including the present one* the Court granted our

7

request to participate in the arguments.

8

And in two of -the three

Now* the District Court's judgment in this case in

9

favor of the Petitioner wasreversed by the Court of Appeals

10

on two grounds* and we believe that the Court of Appeals was

11

wrong on both grounds and that the District Court's judgment

12

should be reinstated.

13

The first ground of reversal was that arbitration

14

under the collective agreement foreclosed suit in the courts

15

under Title VII.

16

because of the severe impact that it had on all of the rights

17

against discrimination conferred by Title VII.

18

Q

This* however* is of great concern to us

Do you suggest that it's undesirable to have

19

rights under the act disposed of by privat® arbitration? that

20

is by factual arbitration?

21

22

A

Congress specified a different method for

enforcing the rights under the act.

23

Q

Did it exclude private arbitration?

24

A

Not in terms, Your Honor.

25

Q

Does any statute ever exclude arbitration
9

unless it does so by the most explicit terms?

Has it ever

been so held?
A

There has been no holding in this Court to

my knowledge to that effect, but we think thelegislative
history indicates that Congress conferred on an individual an
ultimate right to vindication of the rights against discrim­
ination conferred under Title VII by their own lawsuits in the
Federal Courts, rather than to representation by their union
against whom Titi® VII was also directed and was also, in
Congress's view been, in some instances, guilty of the kind of
discrimination that Congress wanted to eliminate in the
arbitration process.
Q

Well, putting aside for a moment, even

though not setting aside as

unimportant the intervention ©f

fch© union her®, or in such cases.

Is it not true 'that the

courts generally for a long time, including this Court, in
opinions, have indicated broad approval of disposition of
conflicts by arbitration?
A

Wall, we believe our position is entirely

compatible with that approval because if the decision below
were to prevail, if an employee could invoke the arbitration
remedy only at the cost of sacrificing some of his Title VII
rights, he would be discouraged from invoking the arbitration
remedy.
Q

I thought your point of the laws was that
10

1

this arbitration did not and did not purport to settle any

2

results under fch® act, but only to settle the rights of the

3

parties under the collective bargaining agreement.
A

4

Well; that is our point in this ass©; Mr.

5

Justice Stewart.

7

our position is.

Court; but we wanted our position known because sometimes the

9

Court's opinions do speak beyond the narrow confines of the

m

That is entirely true.

We felt that in our

That issue need not be passed upon by tills

case.
In this case there is no question but what the

??

12

arbitrator didnot purport to pass on the Title ¥11 issue and

13

h@ had no authority under the collective agreement to pass on

14

anything but a claim upder the agreement.

IS

16

It did have a provision relating to sex discrimination and

17

that is the only anti-discrimination provision in the agree­

18

ment .

The agreement did

Q

19

But it did have a provision which said no

20

21

some provision like that —
A

22

Wall, there ware provisions concerning

23

overtime.

24

in this ease was supported fey those provisions and the Title

The arbitrator ruled that the employer’s position

as to th© meaning of the collective agreement»
;

There is a statutory right at issue that's wholly

independent of the collective agreement here# and if the

4

collective agreement hadn't existed at; all the statutory issue

6

ferred a right ©n individuals.

7

they had a union ©r whether the union entered into a

8

collective agreement with their employer.

9

in this case.

30

It doesn't depend on whether

That's the point

W© have in ©ur briefs elaborated the fact that

13

under— what happened, we recognise, at least in the restate­

32

ment of th© judgment, as elementary principles of th© law of

33

judgment, are directly contrary t© the position which the

34

Court of Appeals took in ‘this case: we have <£4ted. the relevant

35

comments and illustrations from -the restatement in our brief,

36

and as we have pointed out, two other Courts of Appeals, -these

37

of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits, have taken the opposite

38

view about the relation between arbitration in Title VII in

19

circumstances essentially similar to the circurastances here.

20

Q

Earlier this

term we had a case involving a

21

very ancient statute, 18th Century or very early 19th Century,

22

affecting —

23

A

The Arguelles ease.

A

4

Q

Do you -

5

A

We discussed that case inour brief and as

6

we point out in a footnote in our brief, we don't think the

7

present ease presents the difficulty that divided the Court

8

in the Arguelles case.

Q

How d© you spall that case?

A

The Argue lies ease? A-r-g-u-e-i-l-ets.

That, as 1 recall, is the second, rather than the first party.
It's on page 19 of our brief in Footnote Number 6 s United
SSfates Bulk Carrier®, Incorporated, against Argusiles.
I

As we pointed out in that case that the dissenting
“

justices emphasised the fact that the statutory penalty in
those circumstances depended, according to Mr» Justice White's
opinion, entirely on interpretation and application of the
bargaining agreement.

And we ©re not involved with that kind

©f right at all her®.

And for other reasons that we discuss

in the course of -the brief, w@ don't think that the difficul■

21

22
23
24
25

ties of that case are presented here.
Her® all that the arbitrator decided was that the
discharge of Petitioner did not violate the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement, containing no anti-discrimina1
tion provision relevant here.

13

I

In other words, under the Court ©f Appeals*

2

holding the Petitioner is entitled to virtually nothing more

3

than he would have if Title VXI had never been enacted; a

4

decision by the arbitrator about whether the collective

5

bargaining agreement afforded him protection or not»

S

“virtually nothing snore , K because he did have the benefit of

7

conciliation efforts on this behalf by the Equal Employment

8

Opportunity Commission# but those efforts ©re- likely to b®

9

of little effect in a situation in which the possibility of

I say

10

enforcement of Title VII would b© foreclosed, because of the

11

grievance procedure.

12

And we believe, in enacting Titi® VII -fell© Congress

13

did accomplish more than tills, otherwise a large category of

14

of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements would

15

b® virtually denied the banefits ©f Title VII, which to us, is

16

a very important matter.

17

Although the relationship between arbitration of

18

Titl© VII rights was not explicitly discussed in the legisla­

IS

tive history of Title VII, Congress was, of coursa, aware in

20

1984 ©f the widespread use of arbitration under collective

21

agreements, and this is another distinction of the Argue lies

22

case, where we are dealing with an old statute.

23

whole design reflected in Title VII was to confer an ultimate

24

individual right to sue that would not displace other rights,

25

but would b@ in addition to; we elaborat® that in our brief.

14

And yet the

And this is all taken into account in the

f

2

.

decisions of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits which have held
'

3

that the Selection of Eights Doctrina is inappropriate her®.,

|

4

Those decisions X cited on page 16 of our brief.

j

And their holding is that arbitration under the

3
S

collective agreement and remedies ' under Title VII may ©ash

7

b© separately pursued to judgment so long as double recovery

8

is not allowed» which we think is the proper approach. It may

9

b® coincidental that the same remedy is appropriate if rights

10

under both the collective agreement and Title VII have been

11

violated.

12

ment was violated byt he employer? so that issue doesn't even

13

arise•

14
15

i
j

|

In this ©as© no right under the Collective Agree­

There are important differences between arbitration
and the Title VII rights which we

think justify this view and
.

16

one is the fact previously mentioned that the submission of

17

the grievance to the arbitrator is controlled by the union

18

where the Congress in Titi® VII conferred the right to sue on

19

the individual complainant.

20

contescfe that Congress found it appropriate to afford protection

21

under Title VIX against discrimination by the unions as well •

22

as by employers and thought that this was a comparable problem;

23

and although in this case no claim of bad faith in the union's

24

representation is made? it is noteworthy that in the grievance

25

proceeding before the arbitrator the employer was represented

And it is significant in this

15

i

by a lawyer; the onion was not*, and the employer filed a

z

post-hearing brief and the union did not.
We think it’s significant that Congress gave the

3

4

complainant the right fee control his own litigation under

5

Title VII.
Another important difference# and I think a

€

7

crucially important difference is that the scop® of judicial

8

review that arbitrators award is very limited and this is

9

appropriate# because arbitrators are applying the disparate

10

provisions of private agreements.

n

conferred a statutory right ©n individuals and provided for

12

its enforcement through the normal judicial processes which

13

assured greater uniformity in the interpretation and applica­

14

tion of that right and there is a corresponding public in­

15

terest in assuring that access to the courts is available

15

because the availability of that access encourages compliance

17

with the act as the courts have interpreted it.
Q

18

But: in Title VII Congress

Mr. Wallace# didnBt Petitioner also seek

19

redress as under the state statute# the Michigan Civil Rights

20

Law?

21

A

That is a

To his invoking Title VII.

23

prerequisite here# because —

That is correct#

24

and the Michigan Civil Rights Commission determined that he

25

did not have a right under the Michigan Law and then he could

IS

1

proceed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and

2

bring this suit.

3
4

Q

That was a necessary condition of proceed­

ing under the —

A

6

Wellj, if I may 1 will turn to the merits of the

Under the Federal Statute? thatis correct.

7

suit, sine© wa believe that this Court should ©Iso reach the

8

merits* and the Court of Appeals, as a second ground for its

9

reversal ©£ the District Court's judgment, also ruled ©gainst

to

n

!

the Petitioner ©n the merits.
And ©ur starting point on the merits is this

12

Court’s resent decision in Griggs against Duke Power Company,

13

which held that where employment practices are neutral on the!;:

14

face, but discriminatory in their effect, the employerhas the

15

burden of showing that they ©re required by business necessity.

16

This has long bean the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

17

approach to tin® act.

18

. It is true that in the Griggs case, as the Chief

j

19

Justice has pointed out, that with the background of discrim-

20

ination by the employer, this is relevant to the right of the j

21

Attorney General to bring © suit under Title VII because of

22

the pattern of practice of discrimination, perhaps, but it

23

doesn't seem to

that is, essentially the same as the general standard applied

17

set forth in the 1967 guideline on page 41# Appendix B of our

18

brief# and the Commission there referred to obligation on the

19

part of the employer to accommodate to the reasonable reli­

22

virtually identical formulation to the 1967 formulation.

employer's preferences than was the application of the

2

general business necessity standards in the Griggs case ,

3

because there -the employer was required to give up its high

4

school diploma and testing qualifications altogether for jobs

5

for which -they were not shown to be job-related and here the

8

Respondent is free to retain his overtime substitute policy

?

just -as it has been applying it and all it need do is make a

8

simple accommodation to the religious needs of this employee

9

by arranging itself for a voluntary substituta for the

10

Petitionerf rather than insisting that the Petitioner make the

11

arrangement, which is a very minor intrusion, it seems to us

12

on the employer's preferences.

13

The records show that at least four possible 3ub-

14

stitutes were available on each of the Smidays in question and

15

the Respondent did not show that it could not arrange for on®

16

ofthese men to work voluntarily in Petitioner's place.

17

seems to us it was the Respondent's burden to make a showing,

18

but, as this Court held in Griggst The stipulated facts —

19

this is on page 42 of the Appendix —■ that the Petitioner had

20

managed to get a voluntary substitute on at least five pre­

21

vious Sundays, strongly suggests that the employer could

22

similarly have made satisfactory arrangements for the other

23

three Sundays after the Petitioner decided on further reflec­

Mr. Wallace, if someone suggested that your

argument for this act and the agency’s construction tends to

create 'a governmental preference in favor of religious people

Wall, that argument is made in this case?

indeed the argument was made that the application of the act

19

would violate the establishment clause.

20

almost exactly the same preference that this Court held in

21

Sherfoert against Varner which required in the circumstances of

that case under the free exercise clause.

23

with that case and the Virginia Board of Education against

It seems to us to be

It seems a little

I think actually the case that’s most closely in

2

point are .the Sunday closing law cases decided by this Court

3

in the 1960 term.

4

Brown, the Court held that while an exemption for Sabbatarians

5

is not constitutionally required, it is constitutionally per-

0

missible and indeed, the opinion of th© Court said that may

7

well be the wiser way of handling the problem of Sunday clos­

8

ing laws, even though it could be argued that that gives

9

Sabbatarians the advantage t© compete on Saturdays in a way

10

In one of those cases, Braunfeld against

that others can't compete.
There is also an argument advanced her© by the

11
12

Respondent that even if the District Court is otherwise

13

correct, it should not have awarded that case because the

14

Respondent relied in his case on the collectiva bargaining

15

agreement and the Respondent there cites a District Court

16

decision in Oregon in which the District «Judge did not award

17

that -- because the Respondent there had relied on a state

18

statute

19

limiting the weights that can be lifted by women»
We don't think ~ in the first place we do not

20

endorse the decision of the District Court in Oregon, but we

21

don't think that it's really apposite here»

22

here was not in any dilemma comparable to that of the employer

23

in Oregon arguably was in, where he felt he would be violating

24

the requirement of state law if he acceded to the request of

25

his employee.
24

The Respondent

Here, although the collective bargaining agreement,

1

2

the arbitrator held, empowered the Respondent to fire De%?sy,

3

it certainly did not require the Respondent to fir® Dewey

4

in these circumstances and the Respondent could hardly claim

5
6
7
8

it felt its obligations under the agreements to the union
required that it fired Dewey, since the union took exactly
the opposite position throughout the grievance proceeding that
the employer should not fir® Dewey because of thisproblem.

15

probably applied the act here in accordance with the Congres­
sional intent to protect religious freedom and diversity in

reinstated.

10

this matter that the Respondent did not violate the Civil

11

Rights Act of 1964 and I would like to briefly outline them

12

and then go to fchers.

13
14
15

One:

In this case the discharge did not violate

the Civil Rights Act in any way.
Two:

The act itself, the Civil Rights Act itself,

16

contains a number of exemptions, exceptions and limitations.

17

Reynolds falls within a particular exception.

18

Threes

The Government, through the 3E0C, has

19

stated that the prohibition against discrimination for

20

religious reasons, includes an obligation to accommodate

21

religious scruples.

22

under this act for accommodation and the enforcement of accom­

23

modation by the EEOC may well be a violation of the Establish­

24

ment Clause of the First Amendment.

25

Respondent argues there is no legal basis

Fours Even if accommodation is required as a part
26

1

of the prohibition against discrimination the EEOC has issued

2

guidelines which in two instances in 1966 ratified the conduct

©f Reynolds Metals Company, and in the third part of the ’66

4

guidelines we accommodate, in the words of that act.

Because ©f the wording of the act itself

2

A further support for this definition of intent

3

is found in the views expressed by Senate® Joseph Clark and

4

Clifford Case, the floor managers of the Civil Rights Act.

5

In their interpretive memorandum concerning Title VII they

6

noted inter alia: ”Xt has been suggested that the concept of

7

discrimination is vague.

In fact, it is clear and simple and

8

it has no hidden means.

To discriminate is to make a distinc­

9

tion, to make a difference in treatment or favor and those

10

distinctions are differences in treatment or favor which are

11

prohibited by 704 which was later changed to 703 when the act

12

came out, of those which are based on any five of the for­

13

bidden criteria: race, color, religion, sex and national

origin.

10

I submit that with this background I would like to

19

take you through the actual facts of the case.

20

this plant located in the outskirts of Grand Rapids, Michigan,

21

found it impossible, not difficult, as the District Judge

22

said, but as the stipulation says, "found it impossible to

23

work in overtime situations."

24

that overtime under the UAW collective bargaining agreement

25

was based on a voluntary overtime proposition as far as

Prior to 1960

This was because of the fact

1

employees ware concerned, and the plant found ifc impossible

2

to operate on overtime situations.

3

The company negotiated with the UAW in 1960 as the

4

bargaining agent and achieved a compulsory work clause which

5

provides for the allocation of overtime work equally among a

6

classification on a voluntary basis.

questions if we back off this situation we have to back off

20

as how deep that exception is.

21

accept mMr. Dewey, our theory is that we lose our rule, our

22

compulsory work rule, and under those circumstances our last

23

days are worse than our first in the sense that we are back

24

to a pre-1960 situation where we will not be able to work

25

overtime when the company has the necessity.
37

If we release Mr. Dewey or

In other words, this rule of

compulsory overtime applies to all overtime situations, and if

we except as to one individual, whether it be Sunday, whether

5

it be Saturday or whether it be any given day, a normal day,

6

then we can't fire uniformly.

A

My answer is that under our

opinion the

24

matter was settled when it went to the arbitration and in

25

that situation the arbitrator held for the company as against
39

1

Mr. Dewey and that was a final resolution to the ordinary

the way that the Civil Rights Act is applied for the moment,

an employee has two bites of the apple and this is the —

7

and this reminds me to © certain extent of few© small boys who

8

say, "Let's throw two out of three," and they flip.

9

the loser says "Let's throw three out of five„52

And then

In this

10

situation it's heads the employee wins and tails: let's t ip

11

again, because if he loses his arbitration then he goes to

12

the Civil Rights Commission.
Q

13

It sounds to me like that illustration is

14

pretty good with reference t© the fight at all: "Heads I win

15

and tails you 103®."
How would you change that contract to get around

16
17
18

that?
A

Well, I'd like to say, Mr. Justice Black,

19

that I don’t think the contract needs changing and I don't

29

think that the law says w® have to do it.

21

22
23

Q

Suppose the law.has said it and we say it;

how would you get around it then?
A

I would have to say to you that at that

24

point we would have to attempt to negotiate with the union

25

to make certain exceptions to that policy and at that point I

don't knew what the consequences ©f the resolution of the

problem would be.

revealing and they asked at the time — they

time that they intended the act was sure to conflict with the j

rights of seniority nor to affect the collective bargaining

11

contracts which are based on bona fide seniority.

12

And in'the Senate a question was asked:

What if a

13

Negro was the last man hired in your plant and when it came to

14

a layoff situation and tha seniority provisions in it, the

15

junior man would be laid off, as historically is done.

16

may be a question of seniority? it may be plant-wide seniority.

17

What if it says the junior man is to be laid off and this

Negro is the last man in?

The conflict of accommodation has no basis in this

17
18

statute and in effect, is a form of discrimination itself.

19

Accommodation in its simplest form means to adjust, to. help,

20

to d© a favor for.

The Civil Rights Act permits the EEOC to

21

interpret the law.

The Civil Rights Act doesn’t permit the

22

EEOC to legislate.
The Sixth Circuit, on page 32 of our brief, said

23
24

that the requirement of accommodation is not consistent with

25

the act.

The Stempler case from California, which was refused
49

1

certiorari by this Court* a lower constitutional question

2

because the relationship is the Government to an employee*

3

also takas the position that accommodation is not necessarily

4

under the First Amendment.
The Eastern Greylines case on page 33 of our brief*

a decision of the highest court of the State of New York*

7

holds that as to accommodation one not need make an accommoda­

8

tion to particularization which could assume many variations

9

in appearance and in train schedules»
And not only is there apparent as far as we are

10
11

concerned that accommodation constitutes legislation* not

12

13

think that the operation of accommodation by the EEOC* of

14

compelling employers to accommodate* raises the question of

15

whether you are not into the Establishment Clause of the First

16

Amendment.

17

As to Mr. Justice Stewart's question* I

In Schemp you held that the Government must be

18

neutral with respect to religious matters.

If the Government as a general rule is without

Another step, and this was raised also by you

Section 713(b) provides the guidelines upon which and this is

it's a bar t© action on proceedings under this act.

16

If accommodation

The first guidelines, and the guideline which

17

should be applied in this case, is the 1966 guidelines.

18

The employee Dewey was disciplined and subsequently discharged

19

in August and September of *66.

20

for the first time the principle of accommodations as being

21

included within the ambit of discrimination.

22

that guideline said, that-- at 1605183(7) it said, "However

23

24

normal work weekgenerally applicable to all employees long

prior to the discharge of Dewey, long prior to the effective

date of the Civil Rights Act, and

long prior to the effective

guidelines cars® out in

We

I would say that as far as we are concerned that we

10

have not violated the contract -- the Civil Rights Act under

11

any interpretation of the law and I would like to touch upon

12

the election of remedies briefly.

13

general theories that have evolved, of the theories that ware

14

posed here today, the Sixth Circuit saying that the claims

15

that when you have an employer changing adjudication and

16

arbitration he should not foe permitfcecl to proceed on the same

17

claim because you impose upon an employer multiple legal

IS

actions on the same claim and you can lead to an eroding of

19

arbitration as a final remedy.

20

And in th&t area the two

The second theory is phrased in terms of Hutchings

21

and Bowe, in terms that the rights and remedies under arbitra­

22

tion under Title VII are separate.

23

briefly, but I wish you would bear with me»

24

the grievance that was presented, in the arbitration or

25

grievance part of the contract, it was said that it was a clean'

56

And I

mentioned this
In the briefs in

ease of discrimination on the part of the company in applying

2

its policy to Petitioner.

3

In -the process of arbitration in which Petitioner

4

was represented, by the International Rep of the UAW, and I

5

might add, notwithstanding in its ramifications» I think that

in an arbitration in those areas that the International Reps

7

©£ nunost unions are as skilled, if not more so, than many

8

lawyers» and do a better job because this is their bread and

9

butter, vis-a-vis a lawyer who doesn’t specialise.

to

But I say that in that situation the union

11

suggested in that arbitration that the effect of the applica- j

12

tion of the labor agreement resulted in discrimination against

13

its employees who seek to be excused from assigned work for

14

reasons of religion.

Now, the arbitrator found the employe® could not

refuse to work on Sunday because/the wording of the labor

17

contract slid the employer’s consistent administration as to

18

all employees of the relevant provisions of the agreement.

19

I submit to you that the argument that the rights

20

under arbitration are different from the rights under the lav/

21

or under the statute, doesn’t stand up.

22

in this case.

23

the Fifth Circuit, the remedies are different.

24

said before, in this case what is the remedy?

25

arbitration is reinstatement and back pay.

They

are the same

I say you can gat a decision of an arbitrator which

acts as precedent.

stances fch® batter judicial principle would be that enun­

nia* to the effect that you may pursue both remedies as long

9

as you know that when you get a decision in one then the issue

10
11

So that I submit that under the circum­

becomes moot in the other form.
It would appear that this approach to the question

12

would also be sound administratively , speaking in that re­

13

current jurisdiction brings waste, confusion, form shopping

14

and what appears to be an unnecessary series of litigation

15

and I have given away part of my argument in the sense that I

16

think that as far as arbitration is concerned, that Mr.

17

Justice Black discussed the finality of the arbitration.

18

think that we are in serious difficulty as a remedy and I

19

recognise Lincoln Mills and Boys Markets and Steelworkers

20

Trillogy(?) and everything that this Court has said.

21

I

And it can be undone if you allow a concurrent

22

jurisdiction theory.

23

I write into my grievance: you have violated my seniority

24

provisions because you didn't follow the wording of the con­

25

trast and -also I am 49, because of age, and you say that this

What's that got to do with age?

Don't use

And I say under those circumstances this is what

4

is coming in this situation that you then have two bites of

5

the apple in every situation and* unlike the national Labor

6

Relations Actr the matrix of the Civil Rights Act is inter­

7

woven into the labor contract.

a

Everything that you do in the labor contract —

9

all the conditions that you cover involve, and the working

10

conditions cover the prescriptions of the Civil Fights Act so

11

that as far as 1 am concerned the election of remedies theory

12

should be applied.
I “*“* Argue lies/is vary interesting®

17

suffer, that we are going to suffer on arbitration as a final,

process.

19

So, under these circumstances I would conclude by

20

saying that it is submitted that the Civil Rights Act —

21

under the Civil Rights Act, management should have the right

22

to establish working schedules, including overtime.

23

working schedules in this case were applied on a uniform and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F. OOSTERHOUSE, ESQ.

Thank you, Mr. Coughlin.

MR. OOSTERHOUSEs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
First to respond to the possible broad ramificatiorb

61

i

of employers sometime in the futura accommodating all of the

2

different possible religious dates, let me just say that I

religion in this country when it passed the Civil Rights Act,

5

and said: "Employers shall not discharge because of religion.*

I think this is an argument not to this Court, but
to the Congress to repeal this part of the act.

D© you think the .employer here would be

10

client to avoid overtime on the basis of his religion and say

11

He would hs*?e to give the Seventh Day

14

Adventist relief on Saturday under the same circumstances.

15

Mow, if the employer was working a full shift on Saturday and

16

a partial shift on Sunday --

17

Q

If the employer in your case can easily

find a replacement you say he must d© so?

19

A

Y@s, Your Honor.

20

Q

And if he can easily find areplacement

21

a Seventh Day Adventist on Saturday he must do so?

22

I think that the stipulation saying that

19

they were available combined with the other items in the
20
stipulation shewing that employees could get other employees
21

when they had no power to compel them means that these people
22
were available without recourse to the compulsory overtime

clause»

So that's the basis that we 'take the case

he would have a replacement.

This is correct.

Right.
Mr. Oosterhcuse, suppose there are two of

We just don't like to work on Sunday because it's a

good golfing day.

The statute says —

13

Aren't you discriminating against ma

16

A

Well, the statute says that you may not

discharge because of religion and certain other things.
Q

17
18

—

because of religion or lack of it?

15

.

Dewey cannot be discharged, but I can.

Is there anything in Dewey's discharge

that says because of religion?

19

A

I think the evidence shows —

20

Q

Does anything in the discharge say reli­

21

gion?

22

blank, blank church?

23
24
25

That you are discharged because you are a member of

A

Wo.

It's a discharge because of conduct

flowing from Ms religion.
Q

So, it's effect and not cause?
64

A

1

This is a way to say it? yes.

The effect

2

of this practice was the cause of his discharge because of

3

religion.
Now, I think to coma back to the question on golf,

4
5

there is, and the statute sets up certain classifications as

6

being entitled to protection.

7

some extent, a preference for consideration for religion,

8

race, sox, as compared t© considerations of golf or other

9

strictly personal preferences.

There is at that point at©

11

power to pass a statute which would say that a company may

12

not lawfully force with the threat of discharge hanging over

13

him, if he doesn't, fore® any person to work on Sunday who has

14

religious scruples.
A

15
16
.17,

I think it8s paramount to the constitutional

right of freeecercise where the compelling state interest has
been adopted and I see that the undue hardship as a parallel

18

limitation and whether this is a limitation on the power of

19

Congress or strictly on the interpretation of the act, I am

20

not sure.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Well, in effect, the guidelines say that

in certain circumstances you may not override a person's
religious scruples arad make him work on Sundays?

A

This is correct.

Q

Well, I take it then that you would say that

Congress could just impose a flat ban by statute that said

You can't discriminate against me.

I don't have religion, but

A

The statute prohibits discrimination on

certain classifications and to the extent that therefore
people in those classifications have a right not to be dis­
criminated against they are, to that very limited extent,
preferred over people in classifications who are not.
Q

Do you think Congress has as much power to

do that; as it would to exempt people from the draft on account
of religion, I suppose?
Q

There is quite a difference, isn't there,

66

1

in religion and doing something to somebody on account of

their professions of faith, or on account of the conduct which
