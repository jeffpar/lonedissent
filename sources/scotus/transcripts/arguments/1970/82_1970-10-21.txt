JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, nay it please the

Court, this case and the two that follow present the question
j

9
10
11

of the extent of retroactive application of the decision in
Chi.ael vs. California, decided in the 1968 Term.
Chiaiel dealt with the permissible scope of a search

12

without a warrant, but pursuant to a lawful arrest.

13

Amendment has long been understood to permit a search without

14

warrant as incident to a valid arrest.

m

war how far car., a search go arid still be deemed incident to a

16

valid arrest.

17

The Fourth i

The question in Chimel

In that case the Court held that to be incident to

13

an arrest, a search must be confined to the person arrested or

19

to the immediate vicinity from which he might reach weapons or

20

destructible evidence.

21

or the immediate vicinity without a validly issued search

22

warrant would violate the Fourth Amendment.

Any search beyond the immediate person

Q

The searcher.

6

I

The searcher.

I think that there is other

7

doctrine, net: necessarily emanating from Chimel, that holds

8

that if • the officer is legally on the premises he may seize any

9

contraband or other fruits of crime that are visible to him.

10

Q

"& pistol, for example?
Yes.

I think a postol, yes.
.

12

I• ow, in Chisel, the rule of that casewas applied to

13

invalidate iu search of an entire house in which the defendant

44

was'arrested.

IS
16

In

present case, the petitioner was convict­

ed on the 1: a sis of evidence seised at the time of his arrest
when the arresting officers had no warrant.

He was arrested in
!

17

his apartment; after entry into the apartment and arrest of

18

petitioner, the arresting officers proceeded to search through-* j

19

out the apartment.

20

In the course of their search, they uncovered hidden

21

in the closets and in the kitchen certain evidence that was

?'?

material to petitioner's conviction.

23

How, conceivably, the search without warrant in this ;

24

ease went far beyond the petitioner's person or the immediate

25

vicinity of his-arrest, and the government makes no claim now

Chimel doctrine.

The government

bo treat this point in our reply brief and it war­
ranto just v. .few words this morning.

The exigent circumstances

10

alleged here: by the government 'were that the petitioner's wife

13

was present in the apartment at the time of his arrest and that ,

12

she might dispose of incriminating evidence if a search and

13

seizure were not immediately undertaken.
,

This explanation for the warrantless search Is vir-

14

15

'

|
i
\

fcually identical to the justification for a similar warrantless

16

search ofa dwelling in last year's case of Vail vs. Louisiana,

17

The argument was rejected in that case.

There the court held

18

that the requirement for a warrant for search of a dwelling

19

was subject only to a few well recognised exceptions, and that

20

the asserted justification advanced there, which is identical

21

to the one advanced here, did not fail within on® of those

22,

exceptions.

;
I
j

23

How, the government contends that the present ease

24

is different because the officers here were concerned that

25

petitioner might he forewarned of his imminent arrest end flee,
4

S

j

and that this justified the officers in malting the arrest and
i
the search without first securing the warrant.

Now,

the basis

3

of this claim is that an alleged middleman in the narcotics

4

dealings, of waxeh petitioner was accused, was in custody and
that he Knew, he the middleman,

Knew that the officials were

6

seeling his supplier and that he might therefore forewas his

«•i

supplier by telephone.

8

9

j

We think this claim to foe insufficient on the facts.
The alleged middleman hare had been in custody for two days
Bad he been disposed and

10

prior to the arrest of petitioner.

II

able to forewarn his supplier, he would have done so long foe-

ia

fora petitioner was arrested.

13

likely to us that the middleman’s captors would have allowed

14

him unrestricted access to a telephone for the purpose of fore-» !

15

warning accomplices of impending arrest.
Q

16

Moreover,

it does not seem

Well, what led to government's point that his

17

common law wife could very well destroy it after he was

18

arrested?

19

h

Well, Your Honor,

that was — that is the pre­

EO

cis© point made in Vail by the -arresting officers in that case,

21

and the Court that is insufficient grounds for not securing a

22

warrant before malting the search, and that is exactly the point

23

we make here.

24

Q

Tliis isn't here on direct review, is it?

25

A

Ho,

Your Honor,

this is here on collateral
5

I

attack.

This is collateral review.

This conviction became

final — at v;as denied I think in 1967, I believe — 1964,,

a

am correct.,
■

Q

Yes.

A

In short, on this aspect of the case, which I
will leave, the government we don’t believe has shown that the
arresting officers in this case were justified in searching

a

petitioner’s apartment without first securing a warrant.

We
j

9

think it is beyond serious dispute that the search and seizure

j

10

in this case cannot pass muster under the standards for searches;

n

incident to arrest that were announced in the Chime! case.

vz

And so we come to the question of whether Chime 1

13

should be applied retroactively in this case which,

as I said,

14

Mr. Justice’Harlan, arises on collateral review of petitioner's

15

conviction.
We begin with the basic rule of Weeks vs. United

16
17

States and its progeny that a physical search of the person or

IS

his dwelling must be pursuant to a valid search warrant issued

19

by a magistrate upon a showing of probable cause.

2.0

are exceptions to this principle, one of which is that a search j

21

warrant may be conducted as — excuse me, a search may be con­

22

ducted as an incident to a lawful arrest.

Mow, there

23

This Court typically decides federal cases each year I

24

that explicate the basic Weeks rule or its generally recognised ;

25

exceptions.

Ho one would reasonably suggest that each of these :
6

1

decisions in each term of this Court foe given only prospective

2

effect, and wc. snow of no such contention.

q

ment here concedes that this result of automatic prospectivity

*-V

5

Indeed the govern­

might result in an intolerable burden of sorting out the ef­
fective date of each nuance of the basic rule.

6

liven more intolerable, we submit, would foe a regime

7

whereby this Court considered separately in each of these many

8

Fourth Amendment cases whether to apply the case retroactively

g

or prospectively.

And yet we recognise that the Court in re­

10

cent years has limited application of some of its criminal

?!

procedure decisions, including some decisions arising under the

12

Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision.

13

as we see it is therefore in what hind of case, in what class of

14

case should the Court make a determination as to whether to ap­

15

ply a criminal procedure decision retroactively effectively.

16

Indeed,

There

The facts weren't very clear.

Had Chixnel not intervened to overrule Rabi novit is or

put it aside, it clearly would have been said that Vail eroded

15

most if. notci.ll of the basis of Rabinowitz.

16

dication that Vail could be applied prospectively only,

17

is simply another in the continuum of cases that add judicial

interpretation to the meaning of the basic rule that physical

searches must be made pursuant to warrant except where inci­

21

Yet there is no in­

Yet, it would be quite anomalous to hold that Chime 1,

22

which involved a search without warrant after arrest just inside

23

the door, is not to foe given retroactive effect if Vail, which

involved a search without warrant after arrest just outside

One factor in a Fourth Amendment eases is dif­

17

ferente it seems to me, when considering a question of retro­

18

activity from what it might be in right fee counsel cases or

19

something else, and that is because the Fourth Amendment talks

20

about unreasonable searches and seizures, ancl then the question {

21

becomes is it an unreasonable search or seizure if a law en­

22

forcement officer makes a search or seizure relying on the

23

settled law as of the time he makes the search and seizure.

In other words, is it even a constitutional viola­

First, I think there may be some tendency to exalt the

notion of official reliance on the decisions of this Court,

which say that each case turns on its own facts.

I think the

circumstances must govern in every case, and we can make no
real hard and fast rule.

We have quoted the language from Rafoinowitz in our
brief which seems to me to suggest that we can carry it afc
least to soi; a reasonable extrema,

the notion that officers

were relying on Supreme Court decisions every time they take
an action in this area? but beyond that it seems to roe that

ARGUMENT OF JAKES VAN R. SPRINGER, ESQ.,

!6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

17

MR. SPRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the I

IS

Court, without anticipating here the argument in the next

19

case, which I mil also be doing for the government, the

20

Williams case, it may foe helpful to take a minute at the out-

«£ L:

set to outline the issues that are in this pair of related

22

cases and the government ‘ s position and presentation in each

23

of them.

I
!

i
24
25

The present case,

the Elkanich case, can, we think,

foe affirmed on either of two grounds, and I think Mr. Miller

23

1

has acknowledged that, at least to the former matter, first

2

that the search, which happened long before ChIntel, was valid

3

under pre-Chimel standards and Chimel should not be applied

4

retroactively here on court review? and, second, that even

5

apart from that, even assuming that Chime 1 did apply, the

6

search .in this case would be consistent with the principles

7

of Chime1 in view of the conglomeration of special circum­

8

stances that I will discuss in a couple of minutes.

9

In the next case, the Williams case, it is similar- j

10

ly argued that the search was valid under the pre-Chimel

11

standards.

12

Williams contests that proposition, as I think it is fair to

13

say, and Elkanich dees not, but we do not argue that the

14

Williams search would'be valid if it had taken place after

Chimel.
16
17

Accordingly, we urge the Court to affirm the williams

judgment on the sole ground of non-retroactivity of Chimel.
Slow, on this retroactivity issue that is common to

the two cases, they differ in that, as X have indicated,

Elkanich comes here on collateral review, whereas Williams is

here on direct review of the conviction and was in fact pend-

ing in the Court of Appeals when Chimel was decided.

22

For reasons that X will go into in ray next case, we j

23

think that makes no difference since the crucial dividing

24

point for retroactivity purposes should be the base of the

25

search, as the Court held in Desist.

was ample probable cause to arrest Blkanich in his apartment.

there is no issue as to the validity of the arrest here on

23

In fact, the validity of

The Court of Appeals held that there

We acknowledge, however, that the search of the

24

apartment, of Elkanich's apartment, was more extensive that

25

what Chimel indicated would routinely fee appropriate as an

incident to an arrest without a search warrant in the future.

2

It was not simply a search of Elkanich hi rase If and the area

O

within his immediate control where he could obtain weapons or

5

destructible evidence.
We acknowledge, this was a search by
■
several narcotics- agents, and in at least two of the three

6

rooms of' Elkanich*s small apartment, and that it went on for

7

some time.

8

Q

How long?

t.

That is a little unclear.

An hour would you say?
The agents were

10

there roughly an hour.

with them and reveal his sources.

16

The products oJ: the search which were introduced

17

in evidence were really two things, marked currency, which

18

was found in a kitchen closet, and a plastic bag which was

19

found in the living room closet and which was similar to the

20

plastic bag that had been used in some of the salefe of

But, as 1 indicated, we believe the combination of

factors here:

7

what they found, what actually occurred hare.

8
9

First, we think the record shows that there

Second, there was a real danger, we think the
record shows, that if agents did not search the apartment

10

when they did, when they went there to arrest Elkanich, the

11

evidence thej reasonably expected to find in the apartment

12

would be removed or destroyed.

13

And third, and I think most important in distin­

14

guishing this case from some of the others that have been

15

mentioned, the circumstances leading up to the arrest had

16

brought the agents to the apartment with such genuine urgency

17

that it was not reasonably practicable for them to obtain a

18

search warrant, even chough we think they could have if they

19

had had time.

20

Q

Mr. Miller pointed out that the Court, this

21

Court, in Vail last year appears to have at least rejected

22

the idea that the practical considerations are of no concern

This brings me, then, to the circumstances that we

8

7

think make it irnpracable to obtain a warrant, and this will

8

require me to state the facts of the case in considerably more

0

detail than the petitioner did.
This case involved three sales of heroin by a man

10
11

named Rios to an undercover agent, totalling about 60 '.grams,

12

and these three sales were over the period of a week in the

13

summer of 1962»

14

were two more on July 18 and 19..

The first sale was July 13, and then there

Each time the intermediary, Rios, was given marked

currency by the undercover agent.

He went away and came back

17

with the heroin, which suggests,,, of course, that he was obtain­

18

ing it from a then unknown third party.

19

the afternoon, very shortly after the last of the sales, on

20

July 19.

21

When Questioned that afternoon about his source of supply, he

2.2

would say only that it was a Chinese seaman named "Charlie.'1

Rios was arrested on

On his person he had two keys and an address book.

Almost immediately Lang, still the same afternoon ---

13

in fact, all the events of this case through the search take

14

place over the period of perhaps three or four hours, between

15

senetime in the afternoon, which isn't clear from the record,

16

and about 6:00 p.m. when the search took place.

:
|

Lang, as I say, went promptly to the hotel to check

17
13

out what Rios had told him about the keys.

He found out from

19

the manager of the hotel that on July 13, which was the night

20

when presumably Room 30 had been used in connection with this

21

sale, Room 30 had been rented not to any Chinese but to a

,

,

{

22

.

person who signed his name as Joseph ElKanich, the petitioner

23

in this case.

The manager described him in considerable de­

24

tail and said that he had been a little suspicious because

25

the evidence indicated the nest morning that he hadn't slept
30

i

in tW room.
1

z

Lang then went right back to the Harooties Head­

3

quarters, which X presume -- X gather all of these locations

4

are in fairly close proximity to each other, since the events

5

seem to have moved quite quickly -- there he looked up the

3

files on Elkanich, found that he had been involved in

7

smuggling of heroin in the Orient in the past.

8

other matters to attend to in court that afternoon, but as

9

soon as he could he obtained pictures of Elkanich from the San

14

pictures looked, like the man who had rented Room 30 on July 33, 5

15

the night of the first sale,

But he obtained pictures from them.

Then he went back

10

X think it is fair to say that at this Doint, and

17

probably at this point for the first time, probable cause to

19

to the place* where apparently the narcotics had been obtained

20

from, and it was perhaps reasonable to suspect that Elkanich

21

had also been the source for the two other sales within a very

22

short period of a few days that Rios had made to the agent.

23

Elkanich was tied quite clearly

Having suddenly discovered that Ejkanieh seemed to

24

be the man, it was a matter of considerable urgency to the

2S

police, to the narcotics agents, to go after him.

Rios had

with Elkanieh and Rios, Elkanieh might without regard to any

11

telephone call have suddenly discovered that his intermediary

12

was missing.

13

So, in any event, the police, the agents felt, and

14

I think in good faith and with substantial justification that
they should find this man as soon as they could,, and they

16

proceeded very promptly to do -so.
They checked with the telephone company by subpoena

17
18

and discovered that he had an unlisted telephone, having

19

listed an apartment at the address «*- in fact, the apartment

20

where he was, where they went to find him and arrested him and

Q

The difference in this case, as I have tried

6

to show in the facts I stated, is that the case broke very

1

quickly under circumstances where there were good grounds to

a

believe that they wouldn't be able to find the man they were

9

looking for unless they went for him promptly, and then —

10

12

Q

Well, I understand that you found him through

the telephone company.
A

That is no ingenuity.

But they didn't know they were looking for him

13

until -« I don't know how — until a relatively few minutes

14

before they could get the information from the telephone com­

I think so, though there is an additional

were an interstate theft of television sets --

Of course,, there are additional factors here*

Yes,

and X think it was entirely proper for the agents to have

considerable concern for her freedom and her rights to go on

In other words, there could have been a

J
3

A

Yes, I think there was.

Q

Yes.

And as I indicated, there had been a reasonable

identification of Elkanich as the source of the narcotics that t

10

Q

I assume you are not arguing this on the basis j

ft

that we or any other institution has the right to change the

12

amendment, take out of it the word ''unreasonable" and that

13

unreasonable is always the test, that there are no rigid rules

14

announced in the amendment?

15

A

That is certainly so, Mr. Justice Black.

16

Q

Or as the circumstances —

17

A

Of course, over the years there have developed

18
19

different focusing aspects of the reasonableness —
Q

Almost making some rules rigid, but neverthe­

20

less there remains in the smenctaenfc the words "unreasonable

21

searches," doesn’t it?

22

A

Yes, and we would submit, of course, that under

23

special circumstances, such as we have here, it should be open

24

despite Chime! ~~

25

Q

That is why you have given us all the facts?
39

j

t

A

Yes, that is exactly why, and we think that

2

Chime1 cannot be read as an absolute rigid rule as to the only

3

thing that can be done by way of search at the time of arrest

4

and accordingly with these additional factors here which I

5

have put forth.

6

Q

Mr.Springer, I think you

at least 1 under­

stood you to agree with Justice Marshall's suggestion, at

S

least by inference, that there can't be a difference in terms

9

of amendment, in terras of the Constitution on the aspect of

10

the dangerousneSs of drugs, but in terms of evaluating the

n

reasonableness, you did suggest television sets which couldn't

is

be disposed of very easily, but take the extreme now.

13

Would the requirements of getting a warrant perhaps

IS

16

ness?

19

Does that enter into the equation of reasonable­

A

1 think it certainly does, though when you

20

talk about trailer trucks you may get into the vehicle search

21

kind of situation, which perhaps is a different category.

22

Q

Well, the police could always lie down in

23

front of the trailer truck until his colleagues got there with

24

a warrant, whereas he

25

couldn't freeze the situation on

40

1

A

Without, as I indicate, very serious intrusions

2

upon the other occupant of the apartment.

I think a father

3

factor, in addition to the three, the exigency, the probable

4

cause and the danger of losing the evidence, I think it is

5

pertinent to bear in mind that this is a search at the time of

6

arrest.
The fact that there is an arrest does mean that the

7

a

defendant will quite shortly foe brought before a magistrate

9

and quite shortly have a lawyer appointed to protect him.

So

10

I think the context in which this occurrs is somewhat differ­

11

ent from the context where there might not foe the imminent

12

safeguards that arise out of the arrest situation.
I would suggest that there is seme analogy, though

13
14

I don't want to press it too far, between the decision last

15

term in Chambers vs. Maroney, where in connection with a

16

vehicle search the two factors of probable cause and danger

17

loss of the evidence were regarded as enough, without either

18

an arrest or perhaps at least so clearly the notion of the

19

impracticability of getting a warrant.
I would like to move on to the retroactivity ques­

20
2!

tions that have been raised by the petitioner here.

As 1

22

indicated, what I have said so far has assumed what we argue

23

not to be the case, that Chime! governs this ease.

I would

emphasise again that this ease, Elkanich, is a collateral

24

review case, since the search took place in 1962 and the

25

1

I

j

I

\

conviction became final in 1964, so that in order to prevail

2

the petitioner would have to convince the Court that the

3

Chimel rule should be fully retroactive.

4

His principal point, of course, is that, I guess,
j

3

he argues that we don*t have a retroactivity case here foe-

3

cause Chimel was not the kind of change in the interpretation

7

of the Constitution which invokes a retroactivity problem.

3

But I think it is implicit, at least, in what Mr. Miller has

!

l
9

said, that he believes that if w® do have a retroactivity

10

problem here the principles of Desist, in fact all of the

U

Court’s cases since Linkletter in 1965, indicate that this

12

case should not foe governed by Chimel.

13

I think the first place to look in determining

14

whether Chimel is the kind of change in the law that creates

is

a retroactivity problem is the Chimel opinion itself, where

16

the Court discussed the prior law at some length and said

17

clearly that the Fabinowitz case — and I am quoting now —

13

"has come to stand for the proposition that a warrantless

19

search incident to a lawful arrest may generally extend to

20

the area that is considered to foe in the possession or under

21

the control of the person arrested."

22

And then, on another point, the Court says:

"The

23

rationality that allowed the searches and seizures in

24

Rabinowitz and Harris would allow the searches and seizures

25

in this case."

Chimel involved the search of an entire
42

1

three-bedroom bowse by three officers that went on for the

2

good part of an hour.

3

of all of the drawers and cabinets of an office that went on

4

for an hour and a half, and Harris was a five-hour search of

5

a four-room apartment.

S

considerably more

7

so I think the contemporary standards in effect at the time

8

of the search, as expressed explicitly by this Court in its
'
.
decisions, continue to be good law.

9

Rabinowifcz involved a meticulous search

All of these searches, 2 think, were

laborate than the search in this case, and
{

Petitioner suggests that any policeman worthy of the

10

II

name —* to use his phrase — should have noticed some years

12

before Chimel that this Court had lost enthusiasm for the

13

Rablnowitz rule and therefore should have ceased relying on

14

it as a guide for their investigatory work.

IS

unrealistic.

16

I think that is

In 1962, as a matter of fact, though as petitioners

17

suggest without enthusiasm, this Court relied on the

18

Rabinowitz case and the Abel case, considering that we are

19

dealing here with rules of primary behavior by police officers

20

who 2 think have to be able to carry on their work with some

21

degree of

22

is simply unrealistic to say that the police were not entitled

23

to rely upon the Rablnowitz rule in 1962, or for that matter

24

in 1964 when the conviction became final here.

25

certainty and simplicity as to rules.

Thank you.
