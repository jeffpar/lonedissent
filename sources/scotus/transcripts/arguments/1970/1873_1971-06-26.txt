Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL;

Mr. Chief Justice, may I

say in respect of the announcement just made that all three
parties have filed a closed brief as well as the open brief,
and in addition, I have filed just within minutes two statements;,
one prepared by the State Department and one prepared by the
Department of Defense,giving more detail about some of the
items which are discussed in my closed brief.

I believe that

Are you suggesting that these matters last filed

are security matters, or they merely supplement?
A

The only ones that are security matters that I have

filed are all marked "Top Secret".
Q

Thank you very much.

I just wanted to be sure as

to these last documents.
A

The items filed by the Post and the Times I do not

believe are marked "Top Secret”, but they are marked "In Camera"

30

in the caption of the items.

I repeat, all three have also

11

filed regular briefs, except not printed.

12

13

the printed brief for this occasion.

I am told that the lav/ students of today are

14
15

indignantly opposed to final examinations because they say that

16

no lawyer ever has to work under such pressure that he has to

17

get things out in three or four hours.

18

I think it is perhaps fortunate that Ilr. Glendon and Hr. Bickel

19

and I went to law school under an earlier dispensation.

I can only say that

It is important, I think, to get this case in

20
21

perspective.

The case of course raises important and

22

difficult problems about the Constitutional right of free speech

23

and of the free press.

24

press in the last two weeks.

25

questions of the equally fundamental and important right of the
3

We have heard much about that from the
But it also raises important

1

Government to function.

2

First Amendment, and rightly so, but there is also involved

3

here a fundamental question of separation of powers in the

4

sense of the power and authority which the Constitution

5

allocates to the President as Chief Executive and as Commander-

6

In-Chief of the Army and Navy.

7

Great emphasis has been put on the

Involved in that there is also the questioner the

8

integrity of the institution of the Presidency, whether that

of powers, can function effectively.
The problem lies on a wide spectrum, and like all
questions of Constitutional law involves the resolution of
competing principles.

In the first place, it seems to me that

it will be helpful to make some preliminary observations.

If

we start out with the assumption that never under any
circumstances can the press be subjected to prior restraint,
never under any circumstances can the press be enjoined from
publication, of course we come out with the conclusion that
there can be no injunction here.

But I suggest, not as

necessarily conclusive in this case, but I suggest that there
is no such Constitutional rule, and never has been such a
Constitutional rule.
We have, for example, the copyright laws,

I have no objection to that, but these stories which

There is a well known branch of the law that goes under the
heading of literary property.

In some way the press gets

Perhaps it is stolen.

Perhaps it is bought from

a secretary through breach of fiduciary responsibility, or
perhaps it is found on the sidewalk.

If the New York Times

sought to print that, I have no doubt that Mr. Hemingway or now
his heirs, next of kin, could obtain from the courts an
injunction against the press printing it.

Only this morning

I see in the paper that a New York publisher is bringing a suit

against News Day, a New York newspaper,because News Day has
violated what the New York publisher considers to be its
copyright in the forthcoming Memoirs of President Johnson.

branch of equity, involving participation in a breach of trust»

There cannot be the slightest, doubt, it seems to me, no matter

Now, in our main brief in this case which I may
say was largely prepared by my associate, Mr. Friedman, last
evening and last night, we have cited one case which comes very
close to being an injunction by this Court against publications
in the press.

That is the Associated Press case in I believe

215 United States.

The Associated Press is a cooperative of

newspapers, and there the Associated Press sought and obtained
an injunction against the dissemination of news by its
competitor International Press, and that was granted on

the

In 393 U.S., a case involving the Federal Trade
Commission, the Federal Trade Commission against the Texaco,
Inc., involving orders with respect to TBC, Tires, Batteries
and Accessories, the Court approved the order of the Federal
Trade Commission which restrained Texaco from using or
attempting to use any device such as, but not limited to,
/
dealer discussions. They were ordered not to speak to dealers
about this subject, and the First Amendment was specifically
referred to in the brief for the Respondent, and was not
mentioned in this Court's opinion.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, of course, the Times

in this case, and there are no doubt, others,

I did not under-

7
i

1

stand your brother counsel on the other side really questioned
any of this»

I thought at least for purposes of this case

3

they conceded that an injunction would be not violative of

4

the First Amendment,, or put it this way, that despite the

S

First Amendment, an injunction would be permissible in this

6

case if the disclosure of this material would in fact pose a

7

grave and immediate danger to the security of the United States

S

that is, for purposes of this case they conceded that, but

9

they have said that in fact disclosure of this material would

10

not pose any such grave and immediate danger»
A

11

12

glad to proceed on that basis.
Q

13
14

Mr* Justice, if they have conceded it, I am

I am not conceding it for them,

but that has

been my understanding of what the issue is»
A

15

I may say that their briefs were served on me

16

within the last hour, which was entirely in accordance with

17

this Court's order, but I have not seen their briefs»

18

not know what is in their briefs»
Q

19

I do

In other words, I had thought in my analysis

20

and I have not had the benefit of much more time than you have

21

had, that this basically came down to a fact case, that the

22

issues here are factual issues»

23
24
25

A

And that, Mr» Justice, is extremely difficult

Q

To argue here in this Court, I understand»

to --

3

1

A

In open court.

2

Q

I was going to say, qualifying that, except

3

as to the scope of the judicial review of the Executive

4

determination, which I thought you presented.
A

5

Mr. Justice, it was the latter point for

6

which I was seeking to get this, because our contention,

1

particularly with respect to the Washington Post case is that

8

the wrong standard has been used.
Now, with respect to the actual factual situations,

9

thing I can do is point to the close brief, which I

10

the only

11

have filed, in which there are ten specific items referred to.

12

When I say specific items, I must make myself very clear.

13

Some of those are collective.

14

perhaps you cannot see them, the 47 volumes that are supposed

15

to be the background of this.

16

of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which has been filed

17

with the Court.

13

I have brought here, and

They are included in the record

Let me say when we move onto this next item

that it was inevitable that I delegate the question of

19

preparing the supplemental statement which was covered by this

20

Court's order yesterday.

21

22
23
24
25

This Court, as did the Second Circuit,

referred to the materials specified in the special appendix
in the Second Circuit, and to such additional items as might
be included on a supplemental statement filed at five p.m.
yesterday.

I had nothing to do with preparing that supple­

mental statement.

I had able and conscientious associates who
9

1

did work on it.

However, when i had a chance to sae it last

2

evening, particularly after the State Department called me at

3

eight or nine o'clock at night and said they had four

4

additional items, I said that the Court®s deadline was five p.m.
5

5

and that I could not add any additional items, then I examined

6

it,.

1

particular it has at the end a statement in view of the

8

uncertainties as to the precise documents in defendants®

9

custody, and I say that has been an extreme difficulty in this

Here is a copy of it.

I find it much too broad.

11

I thought the New York Times was required to

They prepared an inventory, but from it, it

is not possible to tell whether they are the same papers that
we have.

Part of the problem here is that a great mass of

this material is not included in the 47 volumes.

It is

background material, earlier drafts of some papers which are
materially different from what is included in the 47 volumes,
and as a result we cannot tell from the inventory what is
\

included.

For example, one of the items already published,

which has caused a certain amount of controversy publicly
and internatxnally, is a telegram to the Canadian Government.
That is not in the 47 volumes and is not referred to in the 47
volumes.

.Where they got it, how they got it, what it is, I do
10

I

I

not know.

But in this supplemental memorandum, it is stated

2

under my signature that the petitioner specifies in addition

3

to the foregoing any information relating to the following,

4

and then there are list 13 items»

5

much too broad.

Frankly I regard that as

Therefore, I am saying here that we rely with

6
7

respect to this factual question only on the items specified

B

in the supplemental appendix filed in the Second Circuit and

9

on such additional items as are covered in my closed brief in

IQ

this case,
Q

it

Mr. Solicitor General, does your closed

12

brief cover all of the items on the special appendix and any

13

that you think should be added to it?
A

14

No, Mr. Justice, it does not refer to all of

15

them.

What- I tried to do in my closed brief, I spent all of

16

yesterday afternoon in constant successive conversations with

17

the individuals from the State Department, the Defense

13

Department, the National Security Agency, and I said, ’’Lock,

of what they told me»

are the things that

From that I prepared the closed brief.

Well, Mr. Solicitor General, if we disagreed

23

with you on those that you have covered, the remainder of the

items need not be looked at?

for a full and free judicial consideration of each of the items

Mr® Solicitor General, I don't want to bring

10

in a red herring in this case, or what might be, but do you

11

also say that the ten items you have talked about fully

12

justify the classification that has been given them and which

still remains on them?

Mr. Justice, I am not sure whether this case

Q

I agree it probably does not.

A

Mo judicial proceeding has been brought under

the Freedom of Information Act by either newspaper.

There is

provision there for starting a proceeding in court in case
materials are wrongly determined.

No judicial determination

has been made that any classification was arbitrary or
capricious.

There is a complication here which people who live

with this become familiar with, which is that any compilation
takes the classification of the highest classified item.
Q

I understand that, but on those ten documents

I won’t press you any more»

answered in this case, and is perhaps irrelevant, is that

3

correct?

4

A

You think it perhaps need not be

I think it need not be answered, but my

5

position would be that as to those ten items, it is more than

6

ten documents, as to those ten items, that they are properly

7

classified ”Top Secret51»

8

plain, is four volumes of the 47 volumes, four related volumes,

9

all dealing with one specific subject, the broaching of which

One of the items, I should make

w

to the entire world at this time would be of extraordinary

n

seriousness to the security of the United States.

12

that is covered in my closed brief, and I am not free to say

13

more about it.

14

Q

As I say,

As 1 understand it, Mr. Solicitor General,

15

and you tell me, please, if I misunderstand it, your case does

16

not really depend upon the classification of this material,

17
13
19

whether it is classified or how it is classified.

In other

words, if the New York Times and the Washington Post had this
material as a result of the indiscretion or irresponsibility
f

20
21

22
23
24
25

of an Under Secretary of Defense who took it upon hiraself to
declassify all of this material and give it to the papers, you
would still be here.
A

I would still be here.

It will be one

string off my bow.
Q

I did not understand it was a real string on
15

t

your bow.

That is why I am asking you the question»
A

2

Maybe it is not* but there are those who

3

think it is* anci I must be careful not to concede away in

4

this Court grounds which some responsible officers of the

5

Government think are important»
Q

6

Secondly;, I understand* and tell me if I am

1

wrong again* that your case really does not depend upon any

B

assertion of property rights* by analogy to the copyright law.

d

Your case would be the same if the New York Times had acquired

to

this information by sending one of its employees to steal it*

it

as it would if it had been presented to the New York Times on

12

a silver platter by an agent of the government.
A

13

Yes* Mr. Justice* but I don®t think that

14

literary property is wholly irrelevant here.

15

not depend upon it.
Q

16
17
13
19

24
25

Your case depends upon the claim, as I

result in an immediate grave threat to the security of the
United States of America»

21

23

But my case does

understand it, that the disclosure of this information would

Am I correct?

A

Yes* Mr. Justice.

Q

However it was acquired* and however it was

consideration of that question.

There is not the

10

slightest doubt in my mind that there has been as long as I

from you* that it is your property.

12

A

Yes* Hr. Justice.

13

Q

Now* isn't that correct?

14

A

Yes* Mr. Justice.

15

Q

So declassification vel non does not have

16

much to do with the basic issue, does it?
A

17

I agree with you* except that it is part of

18

the setting.

19

think we would have a considerably greater difficulty in

20

coming in and saying — for example* suppose the material had

21

been included in a public speech made by the President of the

22

United States.

A

7

Until

In large part, yes, Mr» Justice, but I am

8

still trying to get some help from the background and the

9

setting which I repeat, it is not irrelevant, that the

10

concatenation of words here is the property of the United

11

States, that this has been classified under Executive Orders

12

approved by Congress, and that it obviously has been improperly

13

acquired»

14

Q

That may have a great deal to do on the

15

question of whether or not somebody is guilty of a criminal

16

offense, but I submit it has very little to do with the basic

17

First Amendment issue before this Court in this case»

10

A

All right, Mr» Justice, I repeat, unless we

19

can show that this will have grave, and I think I would like

20

to amend it — I know the Court5s order has said "immediate”,

I would like to get to the question of the standard

15

which was used by the District Judge in this case.

I think it

16

is relevant to point out that on page 267 of the transcript

17

in the District Court before Judge Gesell, he said, “The Court

13

further finds that publication of the documents in the large

19

may interfere with the ability of the Department of State in

20

the conduct of delicate negotiations now in process — not in

21

the past — now in process, or contemplated for the fixture

that it will appear to foreign

This is not so much because of anything

26

governments that this govarnmeni

is unable to prevent publication of actual government

2

communications when a leak such as the present one occurs.”

3

Thus the Judge rejected as a standard in this

4

matter the whole question of the ability of the Department of

5

State, and that means the President, to whom the foreign

6

relations are conferred by the Constitution, to conduct

7

delicate negotiations now in process or contemplated for the

8

future*

9

that the conduct of delicate negotiations now in process or

19

appropriate authority only for defense information or material

20

which requires the highest degree of protection*

21

22

or material that the defense aspect of which is paramount and

23

the unauthorized disclosure of which could result in

11

decision, and I suggest this was fundamental error, that there

12

is no proof — this is on page 269 of the transcript of the

13

hearing before Judge Gesell — there is no proof that there

14

will be a definite break in diplomatic relations, that there

15

will be an armed attack on the United States, that there will

16

be an armed attack on an ally, that there will be a war, that

17

there will be a compromise of military or defense plans —

13

in my closed brief I contend that he was wrong on that -- a

19

compromise of intelligence operations, and in my closed brief

20

I contend that he was plainly wrong on that, or a compromise

21

25

But Judge Gesell has used as the basis of his

of scientific anS technological materials.
If the standard is that we cannot prevent the
publication of improperly acquired material unless we can show
in substance and effect, because that is what he really meant,
that there will be a break in diplomatic relations or that
28

1

there will be an armed attack on the United States, I suggest

2

that the standard which Judge Gesell used is far too narrow.

3

Perhaps it lies in between.

4

the present parlous state of the world, considering

5

negotiations in the Middle East, considering the SALT Talks

6

now going on -- it is perhaps not inappropriate to remember

7

that SALT is Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the consequences

8

of which obviously have in all likelihood not the prevention

9

of a nuclear attack tomorrow, maybe not next week, but only by

10

success in this kind of negotiations can we have any hope that

11

our children and our children*s children will have a world to

12

live in.

My own thought would be that in

I suggest that when it is found by the District

13
14

Court that the publication of the documents in the large may

15

interfere with the ability of the Department of State in the

16

conduct of delicate negotiations now in process or contemplated

17

for the future, that should be enough by itself to warrant

18

restraint on the publication of the now quite narrowly selected

19

group of materials covered in the special appendix and dealt

20

with in some detail in m^ closed brief, and the related papers

21

which have been filed with the Court this morning.

I had understood from your papers and the brief that

point out now only that as was evident to us at the hearings

The point, however,

of these hearings did the Government object to their, what is
now called the speed or rapidity of them; at no point was more

Of course, we all labored, as I think is only

proper under the knowledge that a great newspaper was being
restrained from publishing, and that expedition was desirable.

But there is no evidence that I know’ of, that Judge Gurfein

principles, which are interconnected, and which involve the

The reason for that being that

a court has to find its law somewhere.

As Holmes would have

said, I suppose, some legislative "will" must be present from
35

which the court draws the law that it then applies, and that

2

legislative will has to be the President's, if there is no

statute.

not have full inherent power to establish a system of classifi­

6

cation, that he does not have the fullest inherent power to

7

administer that system and its procedures within the Executive

He has his means of guarding security at the source.

In some measure he is aided by the criminal sanction.

But in

any event, he has full inherent powe;r, aid the scope of judicial
review of the exercise of that power will presumably vary with
the case in which it comes up, but

J.

am prepared to concede

the decision in the Epstein Case, for example, which is cited,
I think, in both briefs, that under the Freedom of Information
Act, the scope of review is limited, limited to examining

whether it is proper.
Nor are we arguing that the President does not have
standing, in the sense in which Bakeir and Carr distinguishes
between standing and just his ability, standingto come into
court, which is I think the burden of most of the cases that
the Government cites.

The question that I do argue is whether

there is inherent Presidential power to make substantive law,
not forthe internal management of the Government, but outgoing,
outlooking substantive law, which can form the basis for a
judicially issued injunction, imposing a prior restraint on
36

3

speech.
The decisive issue that ties in this point and our
ultimate First Amendment point is, of course, the exception carve'
out by Chief Justice Hughes in Near v. Minnesota, for that

5

narrow area in which he accepted that a prior restraint on speech

6

might be applied.

7

more solidly entrenched in the First Amendment than any other

a

aspect of it, a rule that is deeply part of the formative

9

experience out of which the First Amendment came, a rule

This is an exception that is made to a rule

10

against prior restraint, based on the experience that prior

11

restraints fall on speech with a special brutality and finality

12

and procedural ease all their own, which distinguishes them

13

from other regulations of speech.

14

"chills" speech, prior restraint "freezes" it.

15

If the criminal statute

referred to — actually, it said we would all assume that a

13

prior restraint might be possible, to prevent actual obstruc­

19

tion of the recruiting service, anc this is the Chief Justice8 s

20

language, or the publication of sailing dates of transports,

21

or the number and location of troops.

22

the present law, the "recruiting service" part of that

23

exception is problematic, but on the: sailing dates of ships and

24

the location of troops, there is a very specific statute.

My suggestion would be that whatever that case, that

extremity, that absolute other extremity, in which action for

14

the public safety is required, whatever that case may foe in

15

which, under this Constitution, under its rules of separation

16

of powers, when the President has independent, inherent

17

authority to act domestically against citizens, let alone to

impose a prior restraint, whatever that case may be, it cannot

19

be this case.

20

magnitude and of an obviousness that would leap to the eye,

21

and that is why, in part, Mr, Chief Justice, I mentioned at the

22

beginning, the period of time that has passed.

Whatever that case may be, it surely is of a

I would suppose

23

that, stretching our imaginations, and trying to envisage that

24

case, the one characteristic of it suggested

25

by the

example that Chief Justice Hughes recited, suggested by the

phrase that the Second Circuit used, which is probably why the

2

Solicitor General resists the word s'immediate," the single

3

characteristic that we can immediately see of such an imagined

4

event would be that it is obvious that the public safety is

5

an issue, that time is of the essence.

Government, which has been reviewing these documents for many

months, not just in connection with this case, but in reply to

n

consisting, after all, of more than just the five witnesses we

12

heard in New York, or the ones that were heard here, over this

?3

length of time, has an unfamiliarity with these documents,

14

substantial as they might be, which is so great that, when news

15

of their publication comes up, nobcdy in the Government knows

16

that somewhere in those documents is one v/hich presents a

mortal danger to the security of the United States.

I submit that that

I would submit, secondly, that while error is always

possible, Judge Gurfein and the Court of Appeals for the Second

20

Circuit, which affirmed him on the record that he had before

21

him, and Judge Gesell, in the Court of Appeals here, all of

22

those judges cannot have been that wrong.

23

Q

Professor Bickel, this is not your case, but

24

reading from Judge Wilke's dissent,"when I say 'harm5 I mean

25

the death of soldiers, the destruction of alliances, the
39

greatly increased difficulty of negotiation with our enemies,

2

the inability of our diplomats to negotiate, as honest brokers,

3

between would-be beligerents."

4
3
6

I take it that you disagree fundamentally with that
statement?
A

Not entirely, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

For

7

example, the death of soldiers — I would disagree that impair­

8

ment of diplomatic relations can be a case for prior restraint,

9

I would say, even under a statute.

10

I would not disagree that the death of soldiers, as

11

in the troop ship, or as in the example that Chief Justice

12

Hughes gave.

13

that any of these judges, including

14

I suppose, is talking about what might yet be shown by the

15

Government, nothing that any of these judges have seen is

16

related by a direct, causal chsiin.- to the death of soldiers or

17

anything grave of that sort.

18

that I have read — what characterizes every instance in which

19

the Government tries to make its case factually is a chain of

20

causation, whose links are surmise and speculation, all going

21

toward some distant event, itself not of the gravity that I

22

would suggest —

23

Q

The difficulty I would have would be that nothing
Judge Wilke, because he,

I have heard it, and everything

You know these reccrds better than I do, but

24

then going back to Judge Wilke, he says, "But on careful,

25

40

number of examples of documents which* if in possession of

2

the Post," and 1 repeat* this is the Post case* "and if published*

3

would clearly result in great harm bo the nation."

4
5

Wow I repeat my question.

You* therefore* disagree

fundamentally with what he seems to say?
A

6

I beg your pardon* Mr. Justice.

1 am not as

familiar as I should be with the Washington Post case.

I had

8

thought that Judge Wilke dissented on the ground that he would

If this is a statement about

10

the evidence that he heard, or that was heard before Judge

11

Gesell, then* depending on what the standard is that he has

in mind* I would think that that language does not quite

13

communicate to me what the standard is* and I doubt that it is

the narrow standard that I would contend for.

But the standard, in general, that I would have in

nation. Some of the things described in the description of

top secret classification in the Executive Order that the

12

Solicitor General read off, I think, would fit that end of the

13

standard.

14

At the other end would be the fact of publication,

15

and I would demand, and this would be my second element, that

the link between the fact of publication and the feared danger,

17

the feared event, be direct and immediate and visible.

Q

I take it then that you could easily concede

19

that there may be documents in these 47 volumes which would

satisfy the definition of "top secret" in the Executive Order,

Mr. Bickel, it is understandably and

abstract terms, but let me give you a hypothetical case.

Let

us assume that when the members of the Court go back and open
up this sealed record we find something there that absolutely
convinces us that its disclosure would result in the sentencing
to death of a hundred young men whose only offense had been
that they were nineteen years old and had low draft numbers.

Q

That was the strong impression that was left

A

I replied to the Chief Justice on a case that

5

in my mind.

6
7

arose without a statute , and tried to distinguish, because it it

8

is crucial for purposes of this case to distinguish between the

9

authority which is here claimed of the President to act

30

independently without a statute, and the possibly greater

11

authority of the whole Government through the machinery of

12

legislation to act in similar premises of which I concede

13

nothing that I don?t have to, Mr. Justice.
Q

14

I have one question which is prompted by this

15

exchange.

Generally speaking there are, as I understand it,

16

no statutes granting immunity to newspaper reporters from

17

disclosing their sources, but there is a firm claim made by

13

newspapers, by reporters, and there have been a number of cases

19

on that.

20

cases in California and several others places, the claim of the

21

newspaper is that the First Amendment protects them from

22

revealing their source even to a grand jury in the investigatioi

23

of criminal matters, because otherwise the newspapers3

24

sources would dry up.

25

If I read the briefs and the accounts of those other

That is generally the thesis of the

50

1

A

There are some cas es that are on the Court cs

2

docket, as you know, Mr» Justice, for next fall»

3

with which I am most familiar is the Caldwell case from

4

California, in which there was a refusal to reveal sources

5

upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit- even to

6

the point of not requiring an appearance before the Grand Jury.

7

But the claim is very substantially qualified»

8

Caldwell holds

9

and perhaps some of the other cases will require the argument

One of them

That is to say,

one does not know how far that might be taken

10

to take it somewhat farther, but Caldwell on its own holds

11

that in circumstances where the Government, as indeed Attorney

12

General Mitchell*s regulations themselves provide, which were

13

issued after the Caldwell case started, in cases where the

14

Government has not shown a clear necessity for the evidence,

15

has not shown that it has not been able to get it elsewhere,

16

has not shown that it is inescapably central to the proof of

17

whatever crime it is that the grand jury is investigating,

18

that in those circumstances where the claim of confidential

19

communications is made by the reporter, there is a sufficient

20

First Amendment interest to protect that claim on the theory

21

that if confidential sources dry up, and the theory runs they

22

would dry up if there were no protection of confidentiality,

23
24
25

there would be a diminished flow of news»
Q

Yes, but the thing is that the newspapers

and newspaper reports claim for themselves the right which this

argument now would deny to the Government»

Mr» Justice, I know there is an appearance

of unfairness or unevenness about it, but I think the answer
that

a reporter would make, and an answer that I find wholly

persuasive, is that neither in this case nor in a case like
Caldwell does the New York Times nor does the reporter claim
someth,ingfor himself, but rather the

claim is made in order

to vindicate the First Amendment and those interests which that
great document serves»

MR. GLENDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, your Honors,

13

General Griswold, Mr. Bickel, I think it might be helpful if
I address my attention to the facts which lie behind these

15

cases, or this case, the Washington Post case, as it comes
16

before your Honors, because I think we have heard here a
17

familiar plea, familiar to us who have been involved in this
13

case over this last intense week, that some more time in needed
19

while the First Amendment is suspended.

say* in this case,, late hours* anyway — the Court of Appeals*

4

two to one. Judges Robb and Robinson, granted a temporary

5

restraining order to the Government to give them some time.,

6

and thus for the second time in two weeks* and the second time

7

in two hundred years* the United States succeeded in obtaining

8

a prior restraint against the press»
Now, the Court of Appeals stated in its order

9
10

that it would send it back* send it to the District Court* and

11

the District Court would try it to determine whether the

12

granting of an injunction for the publication of the material

13

would so prejudice the defense interests of the United States

14

or result in such irreparable injury to the United States as

15

to justify the extraordinary relief that was asked* to wit* a

16

prior restraint»

17

Q

Before you proceed* Mr» Glendon* do you raise

18

that as the proper test?

19

A

I think that is the proper test* your Honor*

20

yes»

21

think the implications of the words may require some

22

development* and I am sure there will be arguments as to

23

exactly what those words mean* but that is the test we tried

24

the case on,

25

That is the test that we tried the case on* sir* and I

Q

Then would you repeat the words so that I
53

I

will have -them in mind?

2

A

So prejudice the defense interests of the

3

United States, or result in such irreparable injury to the

4

United States as would justify restraining the publication»
Q

5
6

Then that would not cover the simple deaths,,

say, of a hundred or two hundred young men.
A

7

Your Honor, that is a hard case you put,

8

obviously.

10

I think we all have to measure this case in the

We have a lot of things under seal that I

I have seen some of it, but I have not

I am going to address myself to those, your

15

Honor, and I am going to point out as best I can within the

16

limits here, as did other courts, and the Government has not

18

like that.

What we have heard, your Honor, is much more in

Can anyone know in any certain sense the

21

consequences of disclosure of sources of information, for

22

example, the upsetting of negotiations , if that were

23
24
25

hypothetically true, in Paris or possible negotiations that
we don*t know anything about in the release of war prisoners,
and that sort of thing?

How does a government meet the

54

I

burden of proof in the sense that Judge Gesell laid it down?

2

That does not bring any battleships to the outer limits of New

3

York Harbor, or set off any missiles, but would you say that

4

it is not a very grave matter?
A

5

Your Honor, I think if we are to place

S

possibilities or conjecture against suspension or abridgement

1

of the First Amendment, the answer is obvious.

8

possibility, the conjecture or the hypothesis that diplomatic

9

negotiations would be made more difficult or embarrassed does

The fact, the

not justify, and this is what we have in this case, I think,

Amendment.

up in New York, and I am sure used it respectfully, but he

15

said when there is a security breach, people get the jitters.

16

I thiak maybe the Government has a case of the jitters here.

But that, I submit, does not warrant the stopping the press

Judge Gurfein used the words

on this matter, in the absence of a showing.
I would like to turn to that, because this matter,

Yet this is what has happened here.

as I don’t have to say, does not come undeveloped before your
Honors.

Two fine District Court judges, two fine Courts of

Appeals have considered this, and in each I think it is fair
to say even in the New York Case, the Government did not meet
its burden.

and I would like if I may to comment upon what the Government

We cross examined as we felt was

The Court had plenty of time to consider the matter,

He delivered* I think you will agree* whether you agree with
his result, a finely reasoned opinion* so there was no rush
and no pressure.

Then the matter went up to the Court of

Appeals, and the Court of Appeals had a session of some three
hours the next day.

I might say* too* and I think this is

perhaps important, there has been no restriction on the
56

i

Governments latitude, because they did have these in camera

hearings which frankly were very difficult from our point of

3

view to deal with, but they did have, them, and they had an

of the equation which you are being asked to consider, and

that is to restrain two newspapers while others are publishing

So to say now that

It is, of course, their

In talking about currency

country is engaged in an intense national debate.

20

classification is important here in your consideration of these

21

cases, because these documents were classified Top Secret.

22

They were classified Top Secret because some unknown individual

23

who is not presented to the Court, whose subjective judgment

24

could not be explored, despite the District Judge asking that

I think it is of interest here, because we are

of these documents except for one individual who said that he

4

had been reviewing them for some two years for sensitivity, and

5

the sensitivity arose from Senator Pulbright* s frequent request

6

to get these documents so that Congress could make the laws,

7

and perhaps the public would be informed*
Q

They were all Top

There had been no review

Does the record tall how long the Post has

had these documents in its possession?

io

A

It does not show, your Honor*

ii

Q

Does it show, if you know, how long the New

12

York Times had the documents in their possession before the

13

Post got them?
A

14

The record in our case does not show that,

15

your Honor, but I have read, and perhaps these gentlemen could

16

answer better than I, I understood they had them in their

17

possession for some months, a month or two*

25

Q

I heard it mentioned somewhere three or four

A

Yes*

months*
It is not in the record, but that is

my best answer*
After this proceeding was brought, and I think
again it is part of the significance of this proceeding, and
during the course of it, although starting out as a point that
these documents were Top Secret and none could be disclosed,
58

1

the Government has offered to review them * and perhaps some of

2

them* they say* will be declassified* which I suppose is some

3

sort of admission that the original classification and the

4 !

original attitude towards them was wrong.

5

Q

It could be that something classified in

6

1965 properly would no lenger be subject to classification* or

7

even 1969 or 1970.

8

A

That is correct* your Honor* and furthermore

some of these documents which were classified go back of course

10

to 1945.

The documents are that ancient.

12

what I have seen of it, that is what it is.

The document itself

It is called a history, and from

The Court in our case had before it, and your

13

14

Honors will see the evidence of which I am aware, and there

15

apparently has been today additional references made to the

16

documents, but it is a fact, and I think it is a significant

17

fact that the Judge there asked the Government to show him a

18

document.

19

respectfully, but this has been a case of broad claims and

20

narrow proof.

21

accept them, they would be worried, but we are talking here

22

about proof.

23

These extravagant claims were made, and I say this

Q

Sxibstantial claims have been made.

If you

Was there an order at any time to produce

24

all of the documents in the possession of either of the

25

newspapers for examination?
59

1

A

There was not* your Honor.

2

Q

Was there a request for such an order?

3

A

4

The Government made such a request* and

because of the concern that the nevrspaper has as to the

5

protection of its source, the documents we were advised would

6

indicate the source, the documents that we had would indicate

7

the source.

8

Q

9

A

Yes, and here is how he resolved it.

10

Q

He let that override the Federal Rules of

11

Who denied that request, the District Judge?

Civil Procedure on Discovery?
A

12

Here is how he resolved it, your Honor.

I

13

think he did it very fairly.

14

to produce the documents — we do not have all of the documents

15

— but if you will not produce all of the documents because of

16

your claim of First Amendment source protection, then I will

17

assume that you have all of the documents, and therefore the

13

Government can show me any document, and I will accept that as

19

being in your possession for the purposes of the case.

20

that under the circumstances that was a very fair way to do it.

21

I, no more than any other lawyer, like to be in that position,

22

but I have to respect my client®s assertion, which is a

23

substantial and I think a valid assertion that a newspaper is

24

entitled to protect its source.

25

your Honor.
60

He said if you are not willing

I think

So that is the way it was,

i

Q

Mr. Glendon, I recall an ancient doctrine

2

of equity about people who come into equity with certain

3

burdens on them.

4

that in a case which largely centers on protection of sources

5

the newspapers are refusing to reveal documents on the grounds

6

that they must refuse in order to protect their sources?
A

7

8

Doesn*t it strike you as rather extraordinary

Your Honor, I dont understand that that is

the issue here.
Q

9

I don*t know about the issue.

It is in this

io

case.

11

standards about people coming into equity with clean hands,

12

which is one of them, and prepared to do equity.
A

14

This is an equity proceedingand there are certain

We did not come into equity.

The Government

You were brought in.

,We were brought in kicking and screaming, I

Q

You are now in the position of making

19

demands on the First Amendment.

20

right to protect its sources, but the Government does not.

21

A

You say the newspaper has a

I see no conflict, your Honor.

I see no

I

22

conflict at all.

We are in the position of asking that there

23

not be a prior restraint in violation of the Constitution

24

imposed on us, and that equity should not do that.

25

in the position of saying that under the First Amendment we are
61

We are also

1

entitled to protect our sources, and frankly I just do not find

2

any conflict bearing on it®

3

The record shows, and I think this is important

4

in your Honors9 consideration, too, we are, as I said, talking

5

about allegedly Top Secret documents, and the record shows

6

that these nomers of Secret and Top Secret are honored perhaps

7

in the breach in Washington, in the way the Government does

8

business, and in the way it perhaps has to do business»

9

is certainly true that there is massive over-classification of

But it

10

documents in Washington®

11

where one government official or another has quite clearly

12

indicated that while everything on his desk may be classified

13

in one fashion or another, in fact, perhaps one per cent or two

14

per cent or five per cent of it really is classified®

15

that is a realistic fact of life here®

16

We have in the record instances

I think

We also have clearly in the record that the

17

Government and the press who have some mutual perhaps antagonism

13

is not quite the word, but they are naturally in opposite

19

corners — the press is trying to get as much news as it can

20

and the Government, particularly where it may be embarrassing

21

or where it may be overly concerned or may feel it is

22

embarrasing or may, in Judge Gurfein*s words, have the jitters,

23

is trying to prevent that sometimes®

24

Government engages itself in leaks, because some official will

25

feel that in the public interest it is well for the public to
62

On other occasions, the

I
2

know* and that overrides any particular judgment of security
or classification.
The recordf your Honors will find, is replete with

3

4

instances where leaks of confidential, Secret and Top Secret

5

material have been given to the pre^s, or the press has found

6

them out and published them, and of course nothing has happened.

7

I think that is significant because here this is the sort of

8

thing we feel we are talking about.

9

itself is concerned, and you will remember the documents that

10

we are talking about are a mixed bag.
Q

11
12

A

I donBt think the source or how we obtained

them features in this case.
Q

15
16

Mr. Glendon, wouldn't you be making the same

argument if your client had stolen the papers?

13
14

As far as classification

Then it would not make any difference?

The

leak aspect has no relevance to the case, either.

17

A

I think it is relevant as background.

18

Q

Then it would be relevant if you stole them?

19

Then you would be making the same argument if your client

20

sent an agent into the Government and stole these papers, and

21

then the Government attempted to restrain your publication of

22

them.

23

A

I do not think that the manner -—

24

Q

Then one is as irrelevant as the other?

25

Q

It is not customary in the Government to leak
63

t

47 volumes at a time, is it?

2

A

Your Honor, that is certainly true»

It is

3

certainly not customary»

4

think you will find, your Honors, in the affadavit that we have

5

attached, and the exhibits that we have attached to our

6

affadavits, indicating secret storias, or allegedly secret

7

stories, based on secret information, that there is probably

8

more secret information there than you will find in these

9

documents, if you examine them,

The size here is different, but I

10

Q

What basis did it have on this case?

11

A

I think it is simply a matter of background,

12

your Honor, an atmosphere to show that this is not an untoward

or unknown situation»

or our foreign friends will be shocked or appalled or anything

15

else, it is simply not so.

This is one of the

I was starting to refer to a district judge telling

17
18

the Government to show, which was what he was supposed to do,

19

and that is what the Court of Appeals sent it back for, and he

20

requested to show these documents, these top secret documents.

21

They were in the courtroom, and the Government was invited

22

and it has been invited to show — let us look at what we are

23

talking about, instead of dealing just with abstractions and

24

conjectures.

25

and I am not going to avert to it, other than to say that the

This was on the so-called "secret" transcript,

64

1

one document that the Government produced in response to

2

this invitation was set forth certain options with reference

3

to the war, and I will not go any further than that, which I

4

think any high school boy would have no difficulty in either

5

putting together, himself, or readily understanding.

6

them are on the public press.

7

All of

Now this is the sort of proff that we have been

8

faced with, and this is the will 'c the wisp that we have

9

been chasing.

10

Q

Then Mr. Glendon, I come back to you with

11

the same inquiry I made of Professor Bickel.

12

close enought to persuade one judge of the Court of Appeals

13

to disagree with what you have just said.

14

A

Your Honor, that is true.

At least it was

I would like to

15

revert to a fact that the other members of the Court of Appeals

16

felt constrained, after they read that particular dissent to

17

just yesterday issue an amendment to their opinion in which

18

they reiterated that they disagreed with Judge Wilke, which to

19

me was some indication of the strength and depth of their

20

feeling.

21

to your Honor, respectfully, that is not based on the record.

22

There is nothing in the record that. I know of, and I think I

23

know the record as far as it has been disclosed to me, and

24

perhaps there was some new material this morning that was not,

25

but as far as the record has been disclosed to me, there is

But your Honor is right.

65

Judge Wilke felt, and I say

1

absolutely nothing to justify that statement, and I say the

2

Court of Appeals felt strongly enough about it to issue another

3

statement, to issue an amendment in which they specifically

4

said they disagreed»
Q

5

The issues in thiss case then really are

6

factual issues, are they not?

As 1 understand it, and this

7

was my understanding initially — I have not heard anything

0

really to modify my understanding — you agreed that an

9

injunction could issue despite the First Amendment if it was

10

shown by the Government that there was something here the

11

disclosure of which would directly cause a grave, irreparable

12

and immediate danger to the country»

13
14

injunction could issue»
nothing of the kind.

Isn't that right?

You agreed that an

Q

So it is a matter of fact.

A

Take the Top Seurat definition or anything

But there is something behind this, too, which I think

perhaps is a legal issue, and that is the scope of the review
here.
Q

The scope of the review of what?

Of fact, the findings of fact under Rule

These are factual issues.

There is one legal question perhaps I will

come to later? and that is the utility of an injunction here,

I take it then yea do assert that there is

Any other standard,

I am talking about.

Your honor, the Government came into court.

They suspended the First Amendment; they stopped us from

printing, and they said they were going to prove this.

injunction proceeding.

This is

Now it may be that the Government

would feel that the courts should become the Defense Department ' s
security officer, and that the courts should delve into this
pile of paper, 47 volumes, on its own,

60

from time to time,

I

whenever the Government is so moved, that the courts should

2

work for them.

3

it, when you bring a case, you are supposed to prove it, and

4

when you come in claiming irreparable injury, particularly in

5

this area of the First Amendment, you have a very, very heavy

6

burden.

7
8

Q

1 say, your Honor, in our system, as I understanc

Do you agree that Judge Gesell applied the

top secret definitions as his guide?

9

A

Yes, I think that would appear so.

10

Q

That is the way he measured the case?

11

A

He looked at it that way, from his opinion.

12

Yes, your Honor, as far as I can determine.

13

Q

14

A

Would you accept that standard?
Yes, I think that fits in clearly to what

15

we are talking about under the doctrine of Near v. Minnesota.

16

Yes, sir.
Q

17

If the trial judge uses clearly erroneous

18

standards, then the case is not simply controlled by facts, is

19

it?

20
21

22
23
24

25

A

I am sorry?

Q

If a trial

judge, in these circumstances,

used a standard to judge the facts, and the standard was clearly
erroneous, then this is not just a fact case, is it?
A

I think, as I understand it, the "clearly

erroneous” rule would apply to the facts, what facts he found.
69

1

2

Q

But if he used the wrong standards,

then it

ceases to be just a fact case?

3

A

I feel that he used the right standard.

You]

4

honors will determine that here, and I think that as far as the

3

law is concerned, that that is substantially the standard.

You can, perhaps, use alternative words, but the thing is, I

think,

which I think is a very good one, that I think perhaps the

are the people's interests.

why I suppose we are here, but you eire weighing here an

15

abridgment of the First Amendment, the people's right to know.

country great for some 200 years.

Judge Gesell made a point,

something that the Government has never done before.

ended up being enjoined.

We

22

I do think that when you come to that balance, in

face of the proof that exists here, that the decision is quite

clear that the First Amendment must survive, because they have
not made out a case.

ORAL ARGUMENT IN REBUTTAL BY
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, I should like to make it plain that we
are not at all concerned with past events in this case.
are not interested in protecting anybody.

We

That should be obvioss

enough simply from the date of the materials which are involved
We are concerned with the present and future impact of the
publication of some of this material.

When I say "future," I

do not mean in the 21st Century, but I also do not mean to
limit it to tomorrow, because in this area, events of great

22

consequence to the United States happen over periods of six
23

months, a year, perhaps two or three years.
24
25

What we are concerned with is the impact on the
73

t

present and the reasonably near future of the publication of

2

these materials.

There is the Associated Press Case, which comes

12

about as close to being a prior restraint on the press case as

13

you can get without perhaps being technically a prior restraint

14

The reason, of course, that there are not prior restraint cases

15

with respect to the press is that ordinarily, you do not find

16

out about it until it has been published.

17

Reference has been made to the fact that, oh, there

19

There are a great many leaks, but I

Now Mr. Justice, your construction of that is

well-known, and 'X certainly respect it.

6

Mr. Justice, that to me it is equally obvious that "no law"

7

does not mean ”no law,” and I would seek to persuade the Court

3

that that is true.

9

You say that no law
I can only say,

As Chief Justice Marshall said, so long ago, it

10

is a Constitution we are interpreting, and all we ask for here

11

is the construction of the Constitution, in the light of the

12

fact that it is a part of the Constitution, and there are other

13

parts of the Constitution that grant powers and responsibilities t

14

to the Executive, and that the First Amendment was not intended

15

to make it impossible for the Executive to function or to

16

protect the security of the United States.

It has been suggested that the Government moved
