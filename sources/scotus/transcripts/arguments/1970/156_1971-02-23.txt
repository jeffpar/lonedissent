MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: WeEll hear ar­

5

berg against Yee Chien Woo. Mr. Gordon# you may proceed when-

6

ever you’re ready*

7

8

MR. CHARLES GORDON# ESC-: Mr. Chief Justice
and may it please the Court.

9

In this case# an alien who las been an overstayed

10

temporary visitor in the United States since 1965# has the

1?

right to remain under a statute which grants special benefits

12

to refugees.

13

The issue concerns

:,he construction of Section 203 (a)

?4

(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act# which affords a

IS

haven for refugees who have £' ed persecution in communist count­

16

ries# who are unwilling or unable to return and who are not na­

17

tionals- of the country or area in "which their application is

IS

made.

19

Respondent unquestionably fled communist China in

20

1953. However# like hundreds of thousands of others his flight

21

stopped at Hong Kong# where he was granted generous residence

22

priveledges, established a home# was married and had a child#

23

and continued to live for 1 years.

24
25

In 1959, Respondent came to the United States for the
first time as a temporary visitor for business# stayed a few

months, anf returned to his home in Hong Kong»

He had established a business in Hong Kong,

Respondent again cams to the United States as a business visitor

and left his wife in Hong Kong to operate the family business,

Q
Was he, when h® left Red China, communist

SO

China, did he take his wife and child with him, or did he leaya

alone?

12

A

He left a:Lone and wasmarried in Hong

Kong,

13

and''the child was born in Hong Kong» He had previously been

14

married in communist Ching, and his wife had died. He had 5

15

children, whom he left there. He was married a second time in

16

Hong Kong, and had an additional child there»

21

family expired in 1965, and -they continued to remain here»

22

Deportation proceedings were brought against Respondent

and his wife and a. Deportation Order was entered against them

A

2

Immediately the Respondent filed an application for

In California,

3

benefits under a proviso to Section 203 (a)

4

refugee benefits to refugees who have lived in this country for

5

2 years.

(?), which grants

6

That application was denied by the Immigration Dis­

7

trict Director and by the Regional Commissioner on the ground

8

that the Respondent was no longer a refugee, since he had firmlyj

9

established residence in the home in Hong Kong,

10

He then sought judicial review. The District Court

11

ruled in his favor, finding that he had not been firmly re­

12

settled in Hong Kong, because of his allegation that he had

13

never intended to remain there; permanently, and that he harbored

U

an intention to come to the United States---,

15

The Court of Appeals; affirmed. They found —the

16

Minth Circuit , the Ninth Circuit found that the question of

Ti

whether he was firmly resettled is irrelevant, the Courts said

18

that under the statute, once Respondent had been a refugee, he

19

was entitled to its benefits, even though he had established a

20

stable, new home in another country.

21

This con—

22

Q

23

That was because, I gather, the statute had

been re-phrased—

Q

It had, and in a moment I shall argue—
Yes,

I

A

-—develop that.

Q

Yes „

3

A

Thai; conclus ion ,

incidentally is opposed

4

by the later decision, of the Second Circuit, in Shen against

5

Esperdy, which is reported in 428 F. 2d,

6

Now admittedly.. Section 203 (a)

(?) of the statute

1

does not contain a specific disqualification of refugees who

8

have been firmly resettled, but I believe that the purpose to

9

exclude -them, it clearly appears if we examine the history and

10

the purpose of the statute, after World War II, the United. State:»

11

became deeply concerned with the massive problems presented bu

12

millions of refugees left over from that war.

13

And it developed temporary programs to deal with those

14

problemso These programs were feflected in a series ©£ measures

IE

adopted from time to time. The first of these, the first major

16

statute, was the Displaced Persona Act of 1348.

17

Under this statute, in a 3% year period, the United

IS

States recieved approximately 400,000 refugees. That statute

10

did have specific language disqualigying refugees who were firm­

20

ly resettled. The next major statute was the Refugee Relief Act

21

of 1353, under which approximately 200,000 refugees were re-

22

sieved into the United States and again the statute specifically

23

excluded refugees who had been permanently resettled.

24
25

After that, the next statute was the Refugee Act of
1957. This was a temporary statute, again, for a limited purpose,

7

1

And the purpose was to assign approximately 18,000

a

visas

3

pired at the end of 1956, The 1957 law said that these visas

4

should be assigned t© a group known as Refugee Escapees, and

5

in designating that group it did not mention firm resettlement.

6

that had been unused whan the Refugee Relief Act had ex­

The next of these temporary statutes was the so-called

7

Fair Share Act. of 1960, Mow this, again, was a temporary meas­

8

ure, It was designed to enable the United States to participate

9

in a world wide movement to enable the United nations to close

10

the remaining refugee camps.

n

And under the terras of this statute the United States

12

undertook to recieve what it considered ltd fair share ©f these

18

refugees in the camps, 25%, Mow again, this statute said nothing

14

about refugees who had been firmly resettled.

15

Q

Did these camps date back to

16

A

World War II.

17

Q

They werenfc the products of the 1957 events

18

World War II?

Mof that's completely independent,

the years between World War II and 1960---

22

Q

23

A

Eighteen years after 19-15.
And the problem had not been, liquidated

24

in 1960, 1959, the United

Nations undertook a concerted drive

8

j

t

movement in so-called War Refugee —- and adopted the I960 Law

2

as part of that movement.

3

Q

These were not part-—this law was not con­

4 cerned with the refugee camps in the Middle East?
S
6

A

No, specifically not, because the United

Nations mandate to which it was tied did not apply to the Mid­

7 dle East,
8

Again, as 1 said, this law, the 1960 law, didn&tmmen-

9 fcion firm resettlement, and it did add language which decreed
10

that it would not apply to those who were nationals of the coun­

11

try in which their applicaiticn was made.

12

Now from these developments, the Ninth Circuit

took

13

the position, came to the ccnci&sion, that because of this chain

n

of events, and the changes in the language of the statute,

15

Congress had intended to make a change in the language of the

16

Court, this was a clear manifestation of Congressional intent

17

to change the criteria.

18

Q

13

arrived at?

20

A

What was the specific language that they

Two things. One, in the Refugee Belief Act

21

of 1953 and in its predecessor, the Displaced Persona Act of

22

1948, there was spoolfie language barring refugees who had

23

been firmly resettled.

24

23

Second, in the i960 Fair Share law, there was new
language saying that its benefits would not apply to those who

9

I

were nationals of the country in which the application was made.

2

The Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that this

3 • addition of the language * "not a national", was intended to
4 jbe a substitution for the criteria for those firmly resettled.
5

No legislative history is cited by the Court of Ap­

6

peals fc© support this conclusion and 1 would suppose that if

?

Congress had intended such a marked departure from the previous­

S

ly established procedures,, criteria, it would have expressed its

9

purpose in.- some clear manner. Yet nowhere in the legislative

10

history is there any indication that a change was contemplated.

11

Moreover, the Second Circuit in a very careful and a

12

very long and detailed opinion studied the legislative history

13

much snore detailed than I must say the Ninth Ciszcuit, they

14

came to the conclusion that no change had been intended.
I think the 1957 la:v furnished the key. The 1957

IS
16

law was the first law which changed the language which elim­

17

inated the "firmly resettled". But in the House report, re­

ie

porting this legislation, and you recall Your Honors, this

i©

legislation was intended to take care of the group left over

20

from the previous law. She House Committee said that they in­

21

hered that in applying this alw, 'the same criteria should be

22

utilized.

23

So it seems obvious that no change was intended.

24

Q

25

The Second Circuit put it on the basis that

the man had to actually be homeless—

10

f

A

Exactly,

z

Q

““-and if he wasn't horealess he couldn't—

3

A

That's exactly what I believe the statute

4

was intended to do,
f

S

Q

6

A

Well? the Second Circuit held that—

And of corse we agree with the Second Cir­

1

cuit, But I think that as 1811 develop my argument, I think

S

that the history of this legislation indicates quite decisively

9

that these statutes are intended to deal with homeless people,

10

II

to provide a haven for the hoseless and the displaced.

i

I believe that the 'not a national55 language which

?2

was inserted for the first time in 1960, had an entirely dif­

13

ferent purpose from that envisaged by the Ninth Circuit,

14

j

The Court, unlike the Second Circuit, which as I say,

15

considered . this with great cs.re, the Court below overlooked the

16

fact that, the 1960 Act was tied to the mandate of the United

17

Nations, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,

18

The mandate of the High Commissioner, which is incorporated in

m

a UN statute, specifically declares, among other things, that

20

his mandate shall not extend to refugees situated in the country !

21

of their nationality.

I

22

So in adopting the criteria ©f the United Nations,

23

Congress followed that formulation. Now when that formulation

24

•was carried over into the 1965 Act, which succeeded these lass,

25

I believe Congress had in mind the change in world conditions

11

f
2

that had occured by that time, 1965 *
In the original refugee laws. Congress confronted a

3

world, Europe particularly, that, was shattered by war, The

4

countries of Europe even the countries which were recieving t

5

their own nationals, were unable to care for such nationals»

6

And therefore the United States pitched in and helped»

7

And in the earlier refugee laws, therewas specific

8

provision for the reception of Greek, Dutch, German, and other

9

ethnic refugees who were situated in the country of their

1C
11

nationality, Italians, I believe, was the other one»
Now by the time that the 1965 law was being considered

12

the situation, as I say, changed» Congress, I believe, conclu­

13

ded that these nations were now able to care for their own

14

refugees, and therefore, it inserted this proviso that it

15

would not extend to refugees who were in their own countries,

16

the countries of their nationality»

17

Now particularly

I call Your Honora attention to the

18

situation of West Germany, which may have been in the mind of

19

Congress, which previously had been the beneficiary of all the

20

refugee laws which had been previously enacted»

Zt

By the application of the "not a national3’ proviso.

22

Congress apparently was saying that West Germany had now re­

23

covered» The ethnic German refugees who were corcahng i&to Ger­

24

many could be cared for by their own. country, and tit was no

25

longer necessary for the United States to pitch in and help»
12
i

1

I think this is the basis for the adoption by Con™

2

grass of the "not a nationala

3

completely without warrant to assume that Congress intended to

4

utilize this special statutory provision for the aid of ref­

S

ugees who didn’t need immediate help, who «.'ere not hemeless,

6

who were not displaced.,

7

proviso, and it seems to me

Our briefs recite the condistent administrative in-

8

terpretaion which has found that benefits under these re­

9

fuges statutes sire not available to refugees who have become

10
1!

12

settled in stable new homes.
Q

Mr„ Gordon, on the Respondents 5 theory

would the refugee status once acquired continue forever?

!3

A

This is the way I would construe it.

14

Q

Incidentally, now that I’ve interrupted

15

you, ie there any distinction in the Immigration Law terminology

IS

between -the-' term national and the • term citizenship?

17

A

Yes, it8 s a slight difference. For instance

18

the present practice, national is a person who is holding per­

19

manent allegiance, to include citizens. It's a broader term

20

than the citizens. As used in out context today, I think it*3

21

synonomous with citizens.

/

22

Now as Isve said, the administrative interpretation

23

is consistently the point of view I’m arguing here today, for

24

example, when the 1957 Act was adopted, the State Department

25

immediately

promulgated regulations which announced the "firmly

1

resettled" concept even though the law hadn51 said anything

a

about ito

s

In addition, a series of reported administrative de­

4

cisions have expressed that concept. And finally, that concept

5

has been reflected in reports which are made by the Immigra­

6

tion Service to Congress every six months showing the operation

1

under Section 203 (a)

8

statute.

9

(7), as required by Section 203(f) of the

Now Congress had never questioned that interpretation,

10

and indeed, no Court, other than the Court below has ever reached

n

a contrary conclusion. Respondent seeks to find support for

12

his interpretation in a statement made by Senator Kennedy dur­

13

ing the course of the debate cf the 1965 law, in which Senator

14

Kennedy said that Section 203 (a)

IS

settled in countries other than their homelands."

18

(?) refugees "must be currently

This statement was 5 small part in an explanation by

17

Senator Kednedy of the many provisions of the 1965 law which

18

primarily was adopted to abolish the national origins quota

19

system.

20

I think Senator Kennedy was not addressing the concept,

2!

he didn't say he was and it doesn't appear that he 'was ad­

22

dressing the concept of firm resettlement, in context, and read-

23

in the statements in. entirety I think Senator Kennedy was speak­

24

ing of providing homes for the homeless, for the displaced. And

2S

in our reply brief at pa^a 6, we set forth some additional ex14

1

cerpts from Senator Kennedys statement.

2

For example, Senator Kennedy spoke of the need for

3

this country to remain."a haven for the displaced", and that

4

"the cases of the greatest need can be processed at once".

£

Later in the floor debate Semitor Kennedy commented that the

6

bill "establishes what we mean by refugees. Those fleeing from

7

communist domination and from the other categories mentioned in

8

the statute»
I believe Senator Kennedys reference to those fleeing

9

IQ

is an accurate paraphrase of the statutory requirement that

II

speaks of those who have fled persecution»

12

Q

To what other act were those remarks di­

13

rected? Specifically»

14

A

Senator Kennedy, there was a colliguy with

KucheX who had questioned him about the scope of the

15

Senator

16

statutory provision, to what extent it would benefit refugees

17

and Senator Kennedy was responding»

18

Q

What were they debating at that time?

19

A

The 1965 law» This is the lav/ which is in

20

question today»

21

Now, as—

22

Q

23
24

25

What do you suppose the Senator did mean,

when he used the language quoted by your brother in opposition?
A

I think, Your Honor, hm wasmmereiy para-

phrasing the statute»
15

£

Must be firmly settled in countries other

Q

1

than the iz homeland»
A

The word, settled nowhere appears in the

5

Q

But it does appear-—he did say it»

6

A

He said it, but it wasn’t reflecting what

3
4

7

statute»

was in the statute»

8

Q

What do you suppose fee did mean—

9

A

As I understand it he was paraphrasing what

10

the statute said. The statute said that the refugee must not bs

11

in the country of his nationality» So what he was saying is

12

that they must be in some other country.

13

Q

Currently settled---

14

A

Settled» And settled

15

1think

he must

mean

by settled, he means situated

16

Q

Well—

17

A

He didn't mean having a stable home, as I

18

understand it.

19

Q

He could mean permanently settled——

20

A

That's why I-- ■

Q

Permanently there—

A

And I don't think he was talking in that

21

22
.23
24
25

s

context at all.
Q

Had the Respondentsgiven

tions in Hong Kong?
16

up theirconnec­

f

A

As far as X know they have , but they have

2

the right to return. They were given a certificate of identy

8

which gives them the right to return.,

4

Q

Is their child here with them in the United

6

A

Yes, sir. Not under order of deportation,

7

Q

Bid they—

Q

A

The order of deportation is against Re­

§

W

States?

spondent and his wife and the child would go with them, if they
return, of course,

n

Q

But the child is presently—

12

A

In the United States,

IZ

Q

The minor child-—-■

14

A

Yes, Sixteen years old,

IS

Q

Is he in business here now? This gentleman?

18

A

X assume so, the record doesn3t show.

11

He came here to attend a trade fair and to exhibit his goods

13

there, I assume he has continued in some business. Nothing in

19

the record tells ua that,

20
21

22

Q

Well, does the record tell us whether he

is still maintaining a business in Hong Kong?
A

Xt doesn8t but I assume that he does not.

23

His wife was conducting the business on his behalf and she came

24

here in 1965,

25

I call attention to one o^her facet of the legislative
17

1

history, and that is the remarks of Senator Hart, who was one

2 I of the chief sponsors of this measure, as a matter of fact, his
3

name was the leading name and the primary name on the bill in

4

the Senate„

S

Now in describing tie purpose of this legislation,

6

Senator Hart said its concern is with the homeless and the

7

oppresed. That's his language» And I think that's a correct

B

description of what the statute means.

9

Now Section 203 (a)

W

(7) reserved 10,200 numbers for

refugees within its description,

n

Q

Could I interlard just a moment, to the

'12

records? What happened after his last temporary visa expired?

13

Did he apply for an extension or did he just stay?
A

14

There were applications for extension until

15

3.965, then his authorized stay expired and his wifes did too,

16

and a deportation proceding was brought and they were found

1?

deportable»

18

Q

But he didn’t try to secrete himself, or

20

A

No, no,

21

Now I've indicated that this is a small allotment,

22

10,200» The purpose of this small allotment, 1 think, is re­

23

vealed in its legislative history, is to afford, grant permanent

24

authority to deal with refugee emergencies, as they arise»

19

25

anything?

This—
18

1

Q

10 „200 over, in what span of time?

a

A

One year. This is an annual allotment.

3

Q

An annual a] lotment

4

A

Part ©f the annual quote. 6$, which adds'

£

out to 10,200.

6

Q

Yes.

?

A

Every year, 10,200.

8

0

Is it always over-subscribed?

9

A

No, Your Honor, it has been for the last

10

2 years, there was a very heavy pressure on it, and indeed, in

1?

1969, the chairman and 25 members of the House Judiciary Com­

IS

mittee wrote the Attorney General, saying that we anticipate

13

that this will be oversubscribed, can’t you admit, additional

14

refugees under parole, and the Attorney General in 1970

15

agreed to do so.

16
17

18

Q

How does he choose if the quota is over­

subscribed, first come, first serva .?
A

First come first serve. It would have to

19

be that way. They are allocated on a: monthly basis, incidentally

20

so that they try to space them out.

21

Q

Your suggestion is -chat, I take it, that

22

this Court is too small 6o expand the statute to include; people

I—

25

Q

Who have resettled somewhere else.

19

!

A

2

1 was about to say that»
Your Honor, I think that's the most impor­

3

cant point 1 can make» The point is that this is a small al­

4

lotment? intended to deal with emergencies, and throughout the

5

legislative history, the sponsors of this measure and the

6

committees emphasized the need to keep this reserve authority

7

in the hands of the President and the Attorney General so that

8

they could deal with emergencies as the need arises»

9

Now—

10

Q

Who were the sponsors?

11

A

In the House? the principal sponsors were

12

Senator? excuse mej, 1 mean Congressman Feighan and Congressman

13

Cellaro In the Senate the princepa! sponsors were Senator Hart?

14

and Senator Kennedy»

15

Q

Assuming that you prevail in this ease?

16

is there any authority in the Attorney General as a matter of

I?

discretion to allow this man to stay in this country?

18
19
20

A

Well? if there were? there are a number

of discretionary remedies? if—
Q

I was wondering if there was any remedy?

2!

I mean is there such authority? I'm not talking about whether

22

it would be exercised»

23

A

I don't know whether there is in this ease?

24

it seems to me that there wouldn't be? unless he can establish

25

that he is a refugee» And he doesn't claim that he has any right

20

i

or any eligibility for any -.discretionary benefit»

2

Mow as I've said thas is a small allocation and the

3

fact that the certainty that it was intended for emergencies is

4

underlined by the fact that the statute saya that these per™

5

sons shall be granted conditional entry»

S

Q

You mean eraergenci.es in the sense for peo­

1

ple who haven81 anyplace else to go, who can't stay anyplace

8

else?

9

A

Right» And emergencies do arise»

'2©

Q

Other countries won't take them»

21

A

I'm sorry I didn’t hear the last—

12

Q

Other countries won’t take them,,

23

A

Either they won’t take them or they don’t

n

have stable residence there» They'll let them stay there for

15

a short time. They’ll permit them to remain. For example,

m

the C2ekSlovak situation, many Czekslovakiar refugees crossed

17

the border and came into ajacent countries, they did not have

18

residence priveledges.

29

Under the emergency authority which is granted in

20

this statute, the President and the Attorney General can admit

2!

them immediately to this country as conditional entrants.

22

Now, in addititon, the fact that this is designed for

23

emergency action, for keeping open the opportunity to deal with

24

emergencies is underlined by the statement in the House committet:

25

report on the 1965 law, that this statute, and I quotes from the

21

1

Committees report, "will permit the President to act immediately

£

if the situation so requires P to come to the aid of refugees as

«J

defined in the Bill,"

t

4

I believe the acceptance of Respondents interpretation

5

would defeat the statutory purpose» Approximately 2 million

6

refugees from China have settled in Hong Kong »

7
8

Q

Your position is pretty well in the teeth

of the statute, isn't it?
A

9

I don’t believe it's in the teeth. The

1G

statute doesn't cover this situation» But the statute does say

11

that the person who seeks his benefits must have fled» That's

12

the language of the statute» and Senator Kennedys expression,

IS

I think is an apt one, we-Q

14

Yes, but you could only admit them under

15

the statute from countries other than the country from which

16

they fled»

17

A

No, yes» But the statute then goes on to

18

say even if they have fled, they can't be admitted if they are

19

national of the—

20

21

Q

If: they’re nationals, but all non-nationals

under the statute could fee admitted^—

22

ft

If they have fled»

Well, there's no question, then is ifc, about

this gentleman, is there?

A

7

That's a literal reading of the statute,

possibly,, but 1 say such a literal reading would defeat the

statutery purpose and would bar contrary to its purpose of

10

providing emergency authority do deal with the homeless, the

11

people who haven’t got a placa to go to»

And this is a statute to deal with refugees.
Q

What was his status in Hong Kong?

A

He was an authorized resident. He had gotten

a certificate of identity, which——
Q

I’ve been there a number of times? I essusae

that almost everybody i& there on a very temporary basis.
A

No, fifty—-

Q

He wasn't a nationalswas he?

A

Ho. There’s no HongKong nationality.

Q

British, X thought.
23

i

A

There is British nationality. And British

2

nationality is world-wide procedure which could be followed in

3

Hong Kong,

4

Q

Then he wasn't a British--

5

A

Ho, he never applied for that. He could

6

have applied but very few Chinese refugees have applied. But

7

he did get residence priveledges in Kong Kong, and he has a

Q

certificate of identity—-

9

Q

Did he have a business there?

10

A

Business, He established a business and

13

continued in that business for 7 years. He had a home there,

12

his family was there, he continued to reside there for 7 years,
Q

13

If in the present posture, for some reason

14

or other, Hong Kong said that he had only 30 days to clear up

15

his affairs and get out, how would that affect—
A

16

If he had no stable residence he might still

17

be a refugee, but Hong Kong does not say that, Hong Kong per­

18

mits the Chinese to remain there in residence indefinitely.

19

There is no suggestion that Hong Kong will expel! a single one

20

of - them,

21

Q

Well, if in the future, and assuming you

22

prevail here, in the future he was so informed by Hong Kong,

23

and given 30 or 90 days to find a new place, would he then

24

resume in your view a refugee, a homeless status?

25

A

It uould bs that he would then, be considered
24

1

2
3

a refugee. Then he would have no home, he then would be dis­
placed,. because of the. event, that went back to 1953 perhaps
and now were reinstated and then he could claim to be a refugee.

4

But now in our view he has a stable homey he is a person who

S

can return to his home, he is hot one for whom the statute

6

was enacted.

7

0
9

Q

Does the record show why he pulled up roots

in Hong Kong?
Well the. record shows that he aad an avid

A

10

desire to coma to the Untied States , and I can only assume that

n

coming here as a temporary visitor he intended to remain.

ARGUMENT OF GORDON G. DALE, ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

17
18
19

20

MR. DALEs Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court.
Respondents position is that Congress knowingly, and

21

intelligently used the term "national” in excluding would-be

22

refugees under this Section 203 (a)

23

applicant qualifies under the literal terma of the statute,

24

unless he's become a national in an intermediate country he

25

is eligible for consideration under the law.
25

(7). And we say when an

1

So when Respondent Harr;/ Woo fled from Red China and

2

he want to Hong Kong, and he opsndd up his one-desk business of

3

getting orders in the United. States for clothing, and was able
.

4

to live in an apartment, of one room, with his $3 Hong Kong

5

money when he arrived in Hong Kong, and was able to make a

6

sufficient business so that he was able to get a trip to the

7

United States as a. business visitor, and he was given by the

8

British government a certificate of identity, and that’s all,

9

he had not become a British national, he* s eligible under the

10

it

Act.
Q

Isn't the status, as Justice Douglas sugges­

12

ted, that most of the people in Hong Kong, precisely that?

13

That is that they're there on a certificate of identity, which

14

has much the same function as a passport, I take it.

15

A

That is basically true, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

except that a certificate of identity gives one no assurance

17

of its continuance. It it a certificate of identify, it has to

18

be renewed periodically, as a matter of fact, Respondents cer­

19

tificate of identity expiree in 1967, at the request of the

20

Petitioner, the Immigration Service, he was directed to apply

21

for a renewal of his certificate of identity.

22

He did so, and was informed by the Hong Kong authori­

23

ties, he must apply in Los Angeles, at the office of the

24

British government there. The British Consulate. The British

25

Consulate said, "We’re not interested. Your application has to
26

I

z
-3
4
5

be made in Hong Kong»"
So at the present time Harry Woo has a 4 year old
expired certificate of identity, We~—
Q

Well at the time he applied for renewal he

was situated, over here,, wasn't he?

6

A

That is correct, Your Honor,

7

Q

But notlegally in the United States,

Q

A

He was legally in the United States undil

Q
10

1966 I believe, on a series of extensions granted by the Isantigration Service,

11

Q

Yes,

12

A

Of his original visit in——

13

Q

14
15

But perhaps a better way to put it is that

he was here at the sufferance, very definitely——
A

I would say that he has been at sufferance

16

since 1966 but he had a lawful extension of his business visi-

17

19

tors visa, each year from 1950 through 1 65,
■
We contend that Congress used this term '’national'1
\
because national is a well recognised term in international law.

20

We use that term in our Internationally Act of 1940, we’ve

2?

used it again in our Act of 1952,- the basic1 Immigration Act

22

under which we now operate.

18

23

24
25

Certain rights and obligations go with nationality.
Among them of course, the most important, military service to
the country of which you're a nation. And in turn the nation
27

i

provides the national with some protection abroad,,

2

For example, could Harry Woo, the Respondent, expect

3

some kind of protection from she British government or the

4

United States? Not at all. They're not interested in him .

5

Do we provide protection for people who have permanent residence

6

in the United States if they're visiting abroad? Not at all,

7

we have enough problems with our own citizens: abroad,

8

9

Q

This is getting back to the legal question

for a moment, you've got a head on conflict between the Ninth

10

Circuit and the Second Circuit. That seems to be recognised.

11

Could you tell me where you -chink the Second Circuit wen toff

12

the track?

13

A

Justice Harlan—

14

Q

Do it- at your own time if you—

15

A

All right.

16

Q

That's the legal question, if

you-—-these

17

two decisions. The facts are simple, and understandable, no

18

dispute ab&ut them, and that's just a pure question of law,

'19

which Circuit is right, isn't it?

20

A

I think that

is correct, Your HOnor.

21

Q

Now I'd like

to know, at your convenience,

22 where you think the Second Circuit went off the track.
23

A

In the Second Circuit the Court stated in

24

referring to the Fair Share Law, for example, the Fair Share Lav?

25

of 1960, the basic refugee act of that time, and they claimed

28

!

that this statute provided the necessary understanding for the

z

1965 statute» And quoted the language under the United. Nations

3

High Commissioner for mandate and the Court; used the language,

4

this particular statute which used the terra not a national only

5

applies to those refugees who do not have the rights and obliga­

6

tions of nationals in the counrty in which they reside.

7

And the Court immediately picked this up and said it

8

seemed to proove the Ninth Circuits position and s claim ex­

9

actly it does indeed. But then the Court makes a leap back into

10

legislative history. We claim that legislative history has no

n

part in this case where the language is absolutely clear.

12

The Petitioner would have us completely topsy turvy

13

apply the statutory construction rule. The statute is plain, but

14

if you delve in&o the legislative history sufficiently, and

IS

not only this act but the s48 act,

10

the 360 Act, the '62 Act, I assure you you can find sufficient

17

confusion that now you can ignore the finding of the statute.

18

the '53 Act, the '57 Act,

Now you're in a position to look and decide what

19

would be a good standard to apply and that's exactly what the

20

Petitioner has done to this statute.

21

Q

Usually don't you have to be a refugee?

22

A

Yes, Your Honor.

.23

Q

Well from what country is Mr. Woo a refugee?

24

A

A refuges from Red China,

25

Q

Where did he come here from?
29

He came hare from Hong Kong»

And he wasn’t fleeing Kong Kong, was he?

He was not fleeing Hong Kong,, but where—

deal of difficulty getting this so called certificate of iden­

14

tity we were directed to obtain—Q

Well assuming that was done he could go

17

A

If he had this—

18

Q

The whole purpose of the Act was to protect

somebody from being sent back to where he had fled»

That iscorrect—

I fail to see how he gets under the refugee

He’s not homeless. He’s homeless now, because

he gave up his home»

A

13

I don't know the source of his ability to

make that trip to the United States, I do know that the purpose

was to get orders for clothing which he then took back to his

made to Mr. Gordon. On your theory is a man once a regugee,

always a refugee?

24

Q

A British subject, and why didn't Congress

25

is a the word citizenship, or citizen, or—
33

A

I

1 would suppose only that because the

z

terra national was used in the 1952 basic Immigration Nationality

3

Act to determine, to describe a national as one who owes per-

4

manent allegiance and it was used again in the 1940 Nationality

S

Act.

6
7

So it's a term that has beer;, used and I suppose that
it—

What is a permanent resident of the United

A

10

17

Well, I say, he owes allegiance in the

Under our law he has to serve in the armed

forces, that's correct.

18

Q

But you wouldn’t call him a national?

19

A

He's not a national.

20

Q

Because you just defined national as a

A

Correct, I think that under our law there

21

22
23
24
23

citisen.

are a couple of island areas where the: natives are nationals.
For example, before the Phillippine Independence Act,
all the Phillippines were nationals of the United States, but

34

1

2

not citizens,,
Q

Well I just wonder if, What about that in

3

this case? People who are living the.*;a with certificates or

4

identity and who have been there quite a while, are they na­

S

tionals but not citizens?

6

A

They/xe not nationals of the Crown Colony,

7

and they®re not citizens» They have a certificate of identity

8

that identifies them as residing in Hong Kong, which can be

9

lifted, so there8s no law that says that there3s anything that

10

guarantees them anything like, for example, permanent residence

11

in the United States.

12

If you have a permanent resident certificate here,

13

so long as you do do not become subject to a deportable offense,

14

you can remain here permanently, the law says you can» There8s

15

nothing that assured for a person who lives in Hong Kong, with

16

a certificate of identity.

17

Q

Mr. Sale, what do you have to say about the

18

governments argument that this statute, this whole scheme,

19

program, was generously concieved to take cate of

20

cases, and you agree that it is a hardship type of statute, how

21

do you fit your Respondent into the hardship category?

22

A

hardship

Of course in the first place I do not

23

subscribe to the governments contention that this is primarily

24

a hardship statute. There is another section of the Immigration

25

Law that allows parole in the United States under Section 212.

35

i

Parole in the united States where there is a real

2

emergency , you can be assumed 'hat under this program of ad­

3

mission to the United States under 207 there is a long, careful

4

screening of each applicant who seeks to come in under this

8

statute, and nobody is just going to come drifting in under

6

203 (a)

7

(7).
If there is a real emergency, section 212 I believe

0

would be used, which allows Attorney General to suddenly parole

9

people into the United States .

10

This is really—-

n

Q

You do not agree that the legislative his­

12

tory of this particular statute demonstrates that it had the

13

purpose of giving relief to oppressed people, refugees, home­

14

less people? Your don’t agree with that?
A

15

16

Yes, 1 agree that was the intention, Your

Honor, but of course I contend that that—

n

Q

Well, then it’s a hardship statute.

18

A

And that a man in the position of Respondent

19

is in a hardship situation, contemplated by the statute.
Q

20

Well, had he aver had any implications that

21

his right to stay in Hong Kong would ha terminated by the Brit­

22

ish?

23

A

He had not, at the time that he left, no.

24

I 'would like to refer to another point that we had

25

made, that the 1951 Sonvention on the Status of Refugees, the
36

?

signatories agree that they will not expel! or campe.ll refugees

E

who coxae into their territory to go back to the country from

3

whence their life or freedom might be threatened.

4

But when the United Kingdom acceeded to the treaty

5

it had the option to include all the territories for whose

6

foreign affairs it was responsible. But the United Kingdom

7

chose to exclude Hong Kong from this agreement. They did the

8

same thing with the 1968 Protocol. Doubtless they had good

9

reasons. Might China not impose certain conditions o& the

10

retention of the Crown Colony and say, "We want some of those

If

national s returned.?

12

But the United Kingdom

didn't want that treaty re­

13

stricting their freedom, and I wouldn't agree that Hong Kong

14

was included. Does that sound like,a certificate of identity

15

holder like the Respondent could be assured that he had a night

IS

safe, even in Hong Kong? We claim no.

17

We claim that this refugee had a place to stay, but

18

it was a very tenuous location indeed, and Congress contemplated

ID

that this was a hazardous situation and did say when you're a

20

national, then you're disqualified.

2!

Q

Well Mr. Dale, 1 think that the governments

22

direction to this man to apply for a renewal of his certificate

23

of identity in Hong Kong, to Hong Kong, was not a gesture, or

M

a futile exercise but was for the purpose of seeing whether he

25

could be reinstated there. And if he could, if he now could be
37

1

reinstated in his former position in Hong Kong, would you still

z

claim he's within the reachoof the hardship statute?

3

A

I would claim that he’s within the reach

4

of the strict construction as passed by Corgross. Yes, Your

5

Honor .

6

Q

Well it’s still an assumption against fact,

7

that if Red China became a democracy next year,

8

be a refugee?
A

0
10

I think we might look to the protocol

to

which the United States has prescribed—

n

Q

Would he still be a refugee under this

12

ACt?

13

left Red China he would be a refugee forever.

H

would he still

I understood you to answer my brother White that once he

A

If he can return to Rec.China which has be­

15

come a democracy and he?s then no longer in fear of persecution

16

because of his race, or religion, or political opinion, by no

17

means can he still maintain refugee statua.

C

Q

m
m

Well what’s the difference so long as Hong

Kong is concerned?
A

20

1 think again it’3 the difference between

21

protections given to a national by his home country, his stand­

22

ing in that country, as opposed to the mere temporary status of

23

one who is at sufferance in his intermediate country.

24

Q

You claim he «as a temporary resident of

25 j Hong Kong?
38

3'

A

Yes, Your Honor, he had nothing as sub­

2

stantial as permanent residence inthe United States where you

3

have a card that says this man has got a right to permanent

4

residence. He, all he has to do is file an address report sard

5

once a year.

6

Q

How long was he there, 7 years?

7

A

He was there almost 7 years.

8

Q

And raised a family, he was just tempor­

0

al ily there.

'20

A

I contend that he—

11

Q

How long was he in this country?

12

A

Something over 10 yeats.

13

Q

So hess three years more permanently here,

14
IB
16
17

than in Hong Kong.
A

I don't think we can contend that he had. a

permanent residence here, despite the 10 years.
Q

Mr. Dale, a little while ago I think you

18

were about to say something about quotas. If the quotas are

19

over subscribed, and he is here, then presumably there are a

20
21

22
23
24
25

lot of other eligible people who can't get in. You were going
to say something about quotas.
A

Yes, Mr. Justice .Blackmon, I wanted to

quote from the 1969 Visa Office Report on the numbers who have
applied and been accepted under this statute.
According to that report, in 1966, 3,391 were admitted
39
■v.V

1

out of an allowed quota of 10,200, In 1967, 4,337, 1968, 6,325,

a

1969,9,850» So that in none of the 4 years reported has the

3

entire quota been used» And I think it's interesting that an

4 one of the Immigration reports, referred to by Mr. Gordon,
3

there is a record of denials of applicants who sought to come

6

in and they denied them on the basis that they were firmly

7

resettled.
And the total number of denials for the whole year

8

9

1967, was 82r, So I think it’s unrealistic to imagine that we're

10

going, to be innundated with refugees either applying abroad,

11

or applying here, under this statute. The facts just aren’t

12

that way.

13

Q

Does the record show why he didn't come

14 here originally out of China?
15

A

Yes, it does. As soon aa he arrived in

18

Hong Kong, according to the applications that were before the

r/

Service, and were considered by the District Court, he indica­

is

ted he tried to come here and was told do you have a sponsor

19

there, and he said no I don't have a sponsor, "Do you have a

20

guaranteed job0? "I don't even know anybody there.” “Well, you

21

can't go.” so forget it.

22

Then he made applications to go to other countries

23

apparently just before he again applied to come to the United

2A

States, he was told he could go to Indonesia, as a refugee, and

25

about the same time he then was' told there's a great program
40

1

going on against Chinese in Indonesia so he didn't go there.

2

Q

May I ask you, due to your familiarity

3

with the Immigration laws, are there any other methods by

4

which a man can foe permitted to come here by any government

5

agency under circumstances like this except to go through the

6

Courts?

7

rule which the government officers are under oath bound to obey

8

that -they must try to keep this man cut?

What I mean is, is there a hard and fast and rigid

A

9

I don't see that this is an absolute rule,

10

but the odd thing is that the Petitioner admits that they have

11

decided every single refugee ease in 1948, 1953, 1956, 1960,

12

1962 and this Act as if the language had never changed. All

13

them are turned down if, in the opinion of the Immigration

14

Officer--

15

Q

Well, you're talking now about the rigid

16

application of the lav?. Does anybody have any authority in the

17

Immigration Department, all the way up to the President to make

18

a suspension in cases like this? To loosten and to relieve

19
20

Of course, we have the novel position of

arguing for strict construction of the statute, which—

you for your information about the other.

20

A

Yes, Your Honor, there is, there's a pro­

21

vision under the Deportation Law that allows what's called

22

suspension from deportation, if he has resided in the United

23

States for in excess of 7 years. However, the instructions have

24

g©n<§ down that no applications will be approved where the time

25

has been built up either by Court action, or by private bills,

in Congress, or by when you came in as a student» or if you

I just think the Second Circuit is wrong,

Your Honor. I would like to refer to the decision of the Su­

where the writers of the opinion said it9s the business of

5

Congress to sum up its own debated in

over, its only the words a£ the bill that have Presidential

7

approval where that approval has been giver,, it3s not to be

8

supposed that in signing a bill, the President endorses the

9

whole Congressional Record.

10

its legislation. More­

And incidentally this record of hearings covers some

11

15oo pagea that are referred to by the Petitioner, for us to

12

undertake to reconstruct an enactment from legislative history

13

is merely to involve the Court in political controversies

14

which are quite proper in the enactment of a bill but which

15

should have no place in its interpretations *, and ending by

16

and large, I think our function is well stated by Mr. Justice

17

Holmes, "We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask

18

only what the statute means."

19

We believe that on the basis of the statute, oar

20

client, Respondent, qualified under the statute should be con­

21

sidered and should therefore be eligible for such a visa, and

22

we ask that the desision of the Court', of Appeals in the Ninth

23

Circuit be affirmed.
