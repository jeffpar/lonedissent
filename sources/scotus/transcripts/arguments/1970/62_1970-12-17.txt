10

On September 10 of 1960, a column appeared in the

tributed by the North American Newspaper Alliance.
The column discussed and reported upon the up-coming

11
12

New Hampshire Democratic Senatorial primary race.

The column

13

had been written by the late Drew Pearson.

14

that there were three candidates vying for the Democratic

15

nomination to oppose the Republican incumbent, the late Senator

16

Styles Bridges.

17

a Dartmouth College professor, a respected political figure in

18

the State of New Hampshire, and clearly the front runner in the

19

race; one

The column reported

Those candidates were Professor Herbert Hill,

Alfonse Roy, who became the plaintiff in this cause

✓

20

in the court below, and one Frank Sullivan, whose release from

21

the Cheshire County Jail, after his 19th conviction for public

22

drunkenness, had been obtained on the eve of the last filing

23

date by Candidate Roy, so the column reported.

24
25

The column further reported that candidate and plain­
tiff below, Roy, had induced and procured Sullivan's candidacy
2

i

as a weans of attracting an ethnic vote away from Hill, and

2

that candidate Roy had done this in concert and complicity with

3

the Republican incumbent, the late Senator Bridges.

4
5

The column characterized candidate Roy as "a former
small-time bootlegger, later U.S. Marshal."

6

Two other candidates,also habituaries of the New

1

Hampshire jail system, had been disqualified by the New

It is our contention, if the Court please, that the

24

trial judge and the New Hampshire Supreme Court misread,

25

misjudged and misconstrued the language of this Court in
3

■§5

Garrison vs. Louisiana, decided in 1964.

2

Q

How much was the verdict?

3

A

It was $10,000 against each defendant, Mr.

4

Justice, an aggregate of $20,000, which is permissible under

5

New Hampshire law.

The trial judge, if the Court please, gave the jury

what was a bifurcated instruction on the law of libel.

lie told

8

them that if they found that the characterization of Roy as a

0

small-time bootlegger was on a par with the criticism of a

10

public official for the misconduct of his office, then New York

11

Times vs. Sullivan would be applicable, and it would be neces­

12

sary for the plaintiffs to show malice, that is that the false­

13

hood was uttered with knowledge of its falsity or with a
a
wreckless cavalier of disregard to its truth or falsity.

?4
15

The trial judge did not stop there.

He went on and

10

told the jury that they might find that the libel was in what

17

he characterized as the private sector.

18

alleged defamation had no relevance to Roy’s fitness for office,

19

if it was merely a bringing forward of his long forgotten past

20

misconduct, if it was not a matter in which the public had no

21

interest, then it was a private matter and New York Times vs.

22

Sullivan would not be applicable, and in that case the plaintiff

23

might recover unless the defendant successfully asserted one of

24

two defenses.

25

He said that if the

lie then told them what the two defenses were under the

4

!

law of New Hampshire.

The first one was justification, and the

2

second

one was conditional privilege. He then

went on to de­

3

scribe

the defense for justification. He said

that the de-

4

fandants could prevail if what they said was true and if it was

5

uttered with, good motive»
Secondly, he told them that the defendants might pre­

6

7

vail if the defense of conditional privilege obtained, and he

8

said that they could avail themselves of conditional privilege

9

even if what they had uttered was untrue, if it was uttered

10

If
12

with a

reasonable belief in its truth, a reasonable basis for

believing it to be true, and it it was uttered

wxch justifiable

purpose and good motive.
He told the jury that if they found the characteriza­

13
14

tion of Roy to have been a public libel, in the public sector,

IS

under New York Times vs. Sullivan, then they must exonerate

IS

North American Ne spaper Alliance because there had been no

17

showing whatsoever of malice against North American Newspaper

18

Alliance.

19

Obviously, the jury found the libel to have been in

20

the private sector because it returned verdicts against each

21

defendant in this case.

22

Q

The second, the alternative part of the charge,

23

instructing the jury as to the conditions under which they

24

could find liability if this were not a public libel, did not

Q

Exactly, Hr. Justice.
The theory being, I suppose, that if it were

5

that kind of a defamation, the United States Constitution had

6

no impact whatsoever upon it.

Is that right?

13

public officials for defamations concerning the discharge of

14

their public duties, namely that the defamation must be shown

15

to have been made with malice before recovery can be made,

16

applies to a candidate for public office, whether he expires

17

to executive, legislative or judicial office.

18

It is our con­

It was the case of Coleman vs. McKenna, and in that

There the Court said it is of the utmost consequence

8

that the people should discuss the character and qualifications

9

of candidates for office.

The importance to the state and to

10

society of such discussion is so vast and the advantages de­

11

rived are so great that they more than counterbalance the in­

12

convenience of private persons whose conduct may be involved

1.3

and occasional injury to the reputation of individuals must

14

yield to the public welfare although at the time such injuries

15

may be great.

I suppose you would contend at the very least

this man was a public figure if not a public official?

Of course, he was a public figure, we contend,

21

applying to him in his aspirations to public office.

22

Q

We say more tlian that, he was a candidate for

Either one would bring it under the Times rule,

wouldn’t it?

24

A

Yes, sir, I believe it would.

25

Q

Uo you think, Mr. Williams, that there is a
7

1

separate category for candidates as supplementing the distinc­

2

tion that is made between public figures and public officials?

3

A

This Court, in Curtis Publishing Company vs.

4

Butts divided, as I read the opinion, with respect to the rule

5

that should apply to public figures as against public officials.

0

I say that there is no reason for division here because cer­

7

tainly a candidate for public office should be treated as a

8

public official.

9

Q

A public official or a public figure?

10

A

A public official, sir.

I think the rule that

11

applies to a public official on defamations concerning the

12

discharge of his duties should apply to a candidate who

13

aspires to such office, because I believe that when a candidate

14

announces for office he lays his life before the press for

15

scrutiny, aid I believe that anything in his life is relevant

16

to his fitness for office, his private life and his public

17

life, his character, his mental and physical health, his

18

record, whether it be academic, professional, commercial,

19

social, marital, or criminal, as in this case.-

20

I believe that all of that is appropriate for public

2,1

discourse and that there is a constitutional protection sur­

22

rounding the discourse so long as it is within the ambit of

23

dialogue relating to his background, his qualifications, or

24

his fitness for office.

Q

As it applies to this case.

In Curtis

Publishing Company vs. Butts, where the Court discussed in

5

great detail the doctrine relating to public figures, as I

6

read the opinion, four Justices of this Court felt that there

7

should be a rule of highly unreasonable conduct applicable to

8

the press before a recovery could be made.

9

felt that the New York Times rule applied, the rule of malice.

Mr. Williams, you probably already said it, but

5

I guess I didn't hear it -- was it a fact, a proven fact that

6

this plaintiff had been a small-time bootlegger?
A

7

There were five witnesses, Mr. Justice, who

8

testified that he had the reputation for having been a small­

9

time bootlegger.

He vigorously denied this and claimed that

10

his brother was a bootlegger.

11

who had been the original source of the information for the

12

writer of this coluum and swore that this man had been a former

13

small-time bootlegger and had admitted it to him.

14

Q

But one witness took the stand

Do I understand though that, treating this as a

15

private sector case, as the trial judge did, it would not have

16

been a defense that it was true?
A

17

It would have been a defense, Mr. Justice, under

18

the Hew Hampshire rule of conditional privilege even if it 'were

19

not true if the defendants reasonably believed it to fce true.

20

But if they offered it with justifiable purpose and good

21

motive --

22

Q

But I would — suppose the jury had found it was

23

true, would it nevertheless under New Hampshire law have been an

24

action for libel?

25

A

Yes, sir, there would have been because under the

defense of justification, even though the allegation is true,

I think. Your Honor, that it is certainly a

before this Court that the moment that a man announces that he

3

is a candidate for high office in this land that he loses all

4

his rights under the area -- in the area of defamation, all the

5

rights that enure to him as a private citizen.
For example* if a candidate announced that he was

6
7

going to run for the Senate and simultaneously in an unrelated

a

transaction he was seeking to buy a house and the prospective

0

vendor was sent a credit report by a credit information bureau

10

in which it was said untruthfully that he had eiqhfc unsatisfied

11

judgments against him, and if the sale were cancelled because

12

of that, then if the defamation ever qot into the public dis­

13

course concerning his fitness for office, if it never became

14

part of the dialogue concerning his qualifications,

15

came within the ambit of what was uttered to influence votes

16

but remained purely private between the credit information

17

bureau and the prospective vendor, we say that his rights would

18

survive as a citizen, under appropriate New Hampshire law.

19

Q

Well, I don’t quite understand that.

if it never

I thought

20

your theory v/ould permit anybody to put that right into the

21

public discourse, even though untrue, would say this candidate

22

That is exactly what I would say.

But. take another illustration:

7

to the candidate’s wife during a campaign and say that he was

while out on the hustings,

and if that stayed private* if if

broke his marriage but if it never got into the public

17

Now we ask not simply that this case be remanded, be­

cause indeed there is no cause for remand; we ask that it be

21

the part of these defendants.

timony in the record was that the editor of the paper himself

In fact,

the trial post-dated New York Times vs.

20

Sullivan and appropriate amendments were made to the pleadings

21

to allege malice within the purview of New York Times vs.

22

Sullivan, and the plaintiff put proof in to show malice so as

23

to comply with the standards of New York Times vs. Sullivan,

24

and I suggest to the Court that that makes it unnecessary for

25

a remand for that purpose.

May I add one other thing, and it builds on

22

the point that you bring up.

Pearson testified under oath

that he didn't make this publication for the purpose of in­

24

structing the voters at all.

25

-- I think it is 190,

Now, you will find that at pace

294 perhaps, and again at 283.
31

what he

1

said was that he was writing this for national consumption and

2

had no intention at all to affect the outcome of the election.
So you get this situation:

3

The defense is that,

4

since this man is running for public office, anything that is

3

said about him to help the voters or to help persuade them

e

should have this privilege, and the man who wrote it said that

7

words the column has more salability then than it would have a

Pearson says, to influence voters.

But there was no effort to use this,

plow, as to whether or not it was relevant and whether

13
'14

to the election campaign, bear this in mind:

15

election campaign itself ever used this bootlegger charge at

!6

all.

17

never put out a word claiming any bootlegging.

!8

vicious thing about this whole case.

19

it is difficult to argue, you can say almost anything about a

20

candidate that may have some relevance to it, almost, and if it

21

is used for the purpose of helping the voters make their de­

22

cision, then it should have some higher standing than as if it
