ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KNUDSEN, UR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

9

MR. KNUDSEN:
may it please the Court.

Thank you,

sir.

Mr. Chief Justice and

This is a habeous corpus proceeding

10

which started in the United States District Court in Wyoming in

11

November 1967, where petitioner's claims were rejected.

12

appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,

13

lower court's decision was affirmed.

14

On

the

The pertinent history of the state court proceedings

15

begins with Whiteley's arrest in November 1964 and his being

16

charged with two counts, breaking and entering and being an

17

habitual criminal.

18

Wyoming by a jury in May 1965 and convicted on both counts.

19

was sentenced to one to ten years on the first count and for

20

life imprisonment on the second, both counts to run concurrently

21

Petitioner was tried in Carbon County,

Wbiteley appealed this conviction to the Supreme

22

Court of Wyoming which affirmed the judgment below.

23

25

In the

the parties stipulated to

and on the record on

Fe

I

appeal fco the Supreme Court of Wyoming.
The issue before this Court is whether probable cause

2

3

existed for petitioner's arrest.

If not* the search incident

4

fco his arrest was illegal and invalid and the fruits thereof

S

could not be used at hi3 trial as they -were.

S

Q

When was he tried originally?

1

A

He was tried in'May 1955* Your Honor.

8

The pertinent facts are as follows:

9

On November 23*

1964* several business establishments were broken into in the

10

small town of Saratoga, Wyoming.

The next day the sheriff of

11

Carbon County, acting on a tip from an unnamed and unidentified

12

informant* executed a complaint or affidavit on the basis of

13

which an arrest warrant was sought and was issued.
With the Court's permission* I would like to read

14
IS

the pertinent parts of this complaint since petitioner's case

IS

in large part was based on the two alleged defects contained

17

therein»

18

19
20

2!

This complaint appears on p^ge four of our brief.
Q

Mr. Knud sen* you say 'based in large part,"

isn't it based entirely on —
4

Well* Your Honor*

three courts below have sur­

prised me by ruling that there was probable cause for a warrant-■?

22

less arrest* and I would like to address that question in a

23

moment* sir.

24

G

You are --

25

A

I think the case rises or falls on this affidavit,
3

!

but the Supreme Court of Wyoming and the United States District

2

Court for Wyoming in the Tenth Circuit have all argued that

3

this was a warrantless arrest based on probable cause.

4
5
6

Q

Their position is that it doesn't make any dif­

ference whether the affidavit
is defective?
/
A

They didn't seem to discuss it, Your Honor, and

7

I take it that they felt that it was defective and that there

8

were other grounds for the warrantless arrest»

9

Q

I just want to be sure of your position.

Your

10

position is that even if there were no affidavit which was de­

11

fective, if the affidavit didn't exist, that still you would

12

have a case here?

13

A

l3o, we would not.

You see. Your Honor, first we

14

have the affidavit which was defective, and then we had the

IS

warrant of arrest which I say was defective because the affi­

m

davit was defective.

n

wide broadcast for all law enforcement agencies requesting them

13

to arrest Whiteley on sight.

This warrant of arrest was put on a state­

19

Q

I know what the facts are.

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

You are setting up a string of dominos and I

22

think your theory is that one tips the whole group.

23

A

Yes, you might —

24

Q

I am asking, suppose your case were such factu­

25

ally that there never was an affidavit, then would you be here?
4

!

2
3
4

A

Yes, I probably would because I say the warrant­

less arrest lacked probable cause and —
Q

1 take it you will expand on this, and this is

what I am interested in„

5

A

Yes, sir, I hope to.

6

Q

All right.

7

A

The affidavit on behalf of the arrest warrant

8

9

reads as follows:
”l, C. If. Ogburn, do solemnly swear that on or about

10

the 23rd day of November, A.D., 1964, in the County of Carbon

11

and the State of Wyoming, the said Harold Whiteley and Jack

12

Daley, defendants, did then and there unlawfully break and

13

enter a locked and sealed building * * *" •—

14

Q

That is the Rustic Tavern?

15

A

Pardon?

18

Q

That is the Rustic Tavern or Rustic Lodge?

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

All right.

19

A

--"contrary to the form of the statute in such

20

case made and provided against the peace and dignity of the

2!

State of Wyoming.!!

22

Now, that is the affidavit.

Now, the warrant of

23

arrest was issued and a state-wide broadcast made to all law

24

enforcement agencies on the basis of this arrest warrant and

25

nothing else.

That very night petitioner was arrested by
5

1

police officers of the City of Laramie, which is the largest

2

city in the adjoining county, Albany County, and they arrested

3

Whlfceley with a deputy sheriff of Albany County,

4

come to what I think is the crux of the case.

5

And now we

This arrest was made solely on the basis of the state

6

wide broadcast.

7

County deputy sheriff had any reason to arrest Whiteley other

8

than the broadcast, and the reason ^fchafc this is so important

9

is that these three courts below have previously passed on this

10

very issue, namely the Wyoming Supreme Court, the U„S„ District

1?
12

Court, and the Tenth Circuit Court t>£ Appeals, and each court
*
has made what I consider the same error, that despite the fact

13

that an arrest warrant had been used, the arrest was valid as

14

a warrantless arrest on the ground that the arresting officers

15

had probable cause, and they find'this probable cause because

10

they were told by another law enforcement agency to arrest him.

n

Meitner the Laramie police nor the Albany

Mow, I think this must be emphasised.

The arresting

13

officers had no independent knowledge of any facts concerning

19

the crime*, therefore I submit that the key question before

20

this Court is not whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest

21

warrant may sfeil'j be valid if sufficient probable cause exists

22

to support a warrantless arrest; rather, the crucial issue

23

here is whether an arrest based on an invalid arrest warrant

24

and without any independent ground on the part of the

25

arresting officer to support a warrantless arrest is valid.
6

1

And I submit

2
3

Q

Kbuld you make that argument if — is Ogburn the

sheriff of ~™
h

Of Carbon County».

3

Q

— Carbon County?

6

.ft

Yes.

1

Q

If Ogburn in fact had probable cause independent

8

of this warrant — lay aside the warrant

9

warrant at all but had information which would constitute prob­

if Ogburn had no

10

able cause for the arrest, would you say then Ogburn could

11

arrest hint personally?

12

A

I guess —

13

Q

I guess the answer to that must be yes?

n

i\

I guess the answer is yes.

I Kind of lean, Your

15

Honor,, to the rule that if you seek out an arrest warrant and

‘16

you don't do it properly, all bets are off, that is the end of

17

it.

18

that if the arrest warrant is invalid but there still remains

19

probable cause for a 'warrantless arrest, it is good.

20

But I Know the lower courts in this country have held

Q

I will go back to my hypothetical.

If in fact

21

Sheriff'Ogb urn had probable cause to make an arrest personally,

22

do you say he could not delegate that to someone via the state­

23

wide radio network of the police?

24
25

A

'&fog X do not.

If he had probable cause, he cer­

tainly could delegate that.
7

1

Q

But your point is that even if he had probable

2

cause for an arrest without a warrant, having once sought a

8

warrant then it stands or falls on the technical infirmities of

4

that warrant?

5
6

h

I go beyond that. Your Honor.

also say that he did not have probable cause.

7

Q

You make both arguments?

8

A

Yes.

9

I say that but 1

1 say that he did not have probable cause.

Mow, I say another way of putting it
Q

10

Suppose the officer had seen it at the place at

II

the time the burglary or whatever it was was being committed,

12

seen him run out, arrested him and also had a warrant, would

18

you say that he could arrest him on this probable cause?
A

14
15

Yes, X think under those circumstances, yes, if

he had actually seen him, yes, sir.

IS

Q

So that is an issue in each case, I suppose?

17

A

Your Honor, here there is no information whatso­

18

ever other than this anonymous tip, we have no underlying cir­

18

cumstances --- I am coming now to the affidavit -- there are no

20

underlying circumstances to show that Whiteley had anything to

21

do mth the crime — Spine Hi and Giordenell o — and secondly

22

there are no underlying facts set forth to show that the in-

23

25

defense counsel asked him how he got this information, he said

In fact, Ogburn didn't even show that there was an

Ho, he did not, Your Honor.

I don’t know why.

This was tried several years before I carae to Wyoming, and 1 do

not know.

very useful to challenge it?

\*m3

A

I think that might have been a tactic, but —

Q

Was he represented by counsel at the trial?

19

A

Yes, sir, assigned counsel.

I submit. Your

20

Honors, that another way of putting this is whether an invalid

21

arrest warrant can be validated by airing it on a broadcast to

22

other law enforcement agencies.

23

simple.

24

starting out with the Wyoming Supreme Court, which held that

25

this was a good warrantless arrest because the police officer

1

I think that the courts below have gotten confused,

9
l

think th&case is that

f

in Laramie had been told to arrest him by the Sheriff of Carbon

2

County,, and 1 do not see how an arrest warrant that is bad can

3

be validated by putting it on the air.

4

nothing

5

there is nothing in the record to show that there is any prob­

8

able cause here that the sheriff bad which he did not disclose

7

to the magistrate.

s

and I want to make this very clear to the Court —

Q

0

There is absolutely

The record is barren on the point.

Is thereany dispute that the original arresting

officer who issued the. broadcast could not have arrested him?
&

10

1 feel. Your Honor — in fact I say that in my

11

brief — that Ogburn, who was the affiant, could not have

!2

arrested him on the basis of his information because it was

13

based on an unidentified informant not proven to be reliable.
Q

14
15

Do you go so far as to say whoever acted on that

broadcast had no more right than he had?
h

18

Exactly, Your Honor.

In fact* it is kind of

17

like Hr. Blacknmn's dcmino theory.

IS

that to you, sir, but since the affidavit was bad, the arrest

m

warrant was bad — anything done pursuant to that arrest warrant

20

was bad by anyone, including Ogburn, and I think this is the

21

case.

If the Court has no more questions, I would like to
reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
Q

Yes, let me ask another fact question.

what was the defendant charged?

With

A

He was charged with breaking and entering and

the violation of the habitual criminal statute in Wyoming.
Q

Wellc

let’s be a little more, specific.

He was

charged with breaking and entering what?
A

He was charged with breaking and entering

Shively’s Hardware Store.
0

And the original affidavit had nothing to do

with Shively’s Hardware Store?
A

Yes, but 1 don’t make an issue of that. Your

Maybe we do.

A

Oh.

Q

Because he was charged with something different

Honor.

than'' the affidavit had to do with.
A

Yes.

I did not because I felt that both affi­

davits were equally defective.

The first one had to do with

another man’s store across the street, and the second one
which had to do with Shively’s Hardware.

I think they are

eq ualXy defective.
Q

Was there a second affidavit?

Wasn’t if the

formal charge —
A

No, it was an affidavit after he was arrested,

at least I am"'pretty sure it was an affidavit, which was made
after the arrest, and this was the basis for the further pro­
ceedings.

But it is necessarily your position, however,

that despite this difference in the accusatory affidavit orig­

A

Yes, Your Honor.

9

Q

Whatwas the searchthat followed

A

The search was of Whiteley's car.

10

it was

from the ar-

rest?

11

He was put in

12

the police car behind his car and they searched the trunk and

13

the inside of the car and found incriminating evidence.

14

not say that the search was invalid, Your Honor.

I do

15

Q

What was it they found?

16

A

Sir?

17

Q

iShafc did they find?

18

A

They found burglar's tools and they found coins.

19

Shively was a-collector of old coins, and they found many of

20

these coins in the car and --

21

Q

That had been in the hardware store?

22

A

That had been in the hardware store, yes,

2A

No doubt about that?

Q

Did he testify?

White ley?

3

Q

The defendant.

4

A

Yes, he testified and he said that he had not

done it,

that his compatriot had had the car the night before

6

and he didn11 know what had happened.

7

both had done it.

His comat riot said they

Somebody just put them in his car?

He said that they had don® the robbery together?

he did.

A moment ago I said I

didn’t make any contention about the search.

18

19

If the arrest was

I do not' make any contention about the search.
Q

Don’t you have to

contend that the search is

unlawful here?
A

No* Your Honor, we feel that the arrest was un­

20

lawful and as a consequence the search was unlawful because the

21

arrest, was unlawful.

22

Q

Well,

that is what I mean.

23

A

Ye s.

?A

Q

That is what I mean.

25

A

Yes.

Q

You mean it is' really the fruit of an unlawful

A

Yes* Your Honor, yes.

4

Q

The arrest itself, I suppose, was cured, any

2

arrest.
But if the --

5

defect in the arrest itself -— let's assume there had been no

6

search and no seizure, only what you say was an invalid arrest.

7

and then he was brought to trial and sufficient evidence was

s

brought out to convict him, you certainly couldn't get the

9

conviction set aside.

10

A

Well, first of all, I would say that Daley's

11

testimony is the fruit of a poisonous tree, that was the co­

12

defendant.

13

Q

Yes»

14

A

And that would certainly foe enough to reverse

15

this case.

But if.they convicted him solely on other informa­

16

tion, other data that they found at the scene, and not on

17

Daley's testimony and not on anything they found in the car,

IS

then I would say this case would not be -Q

But they did put in evidence what they found in

They certainly did. Your Honor.

There is no room for a harmless error claim?

A

Your Honor, with the burglary tools,, with the

here.

OKI BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SPEIGHT:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.

14

the Court has raised before I go into discussion of my aspect

15

of the case.

16

I would like to direct myself to several questions

I might add that my good friend, the counsel here,

17

and I, he at the law school and I in the Attorney General's

18

office, have been fighting this for four years.

19

with it first at the federal court level and have taken it

20

right fchrougjh and we have lost issues along the way and now we

2!

are down to the real nub, and we do have a great familiarity

22

with this case, as does this Court obviously, by its questions.

23

We started

But I "would like to spend a moment on Justice

24

Blackmun's question, because 1 think he puts the finger right

23

on the case.
15

j

1

We have consistently argued from all levels of the

z

courts that we can care less about that arrest warrant, that it

is quite immaterial to our proposition.

about is whether or not there was probable cause to male© the

arrest and/or the search.

at this court.

9

What we are talking

Judge Kerr, the federal district
The Tenth Circuit, Judge Hickey,

And Justice Blackmun, this is the key question as far

10

as the state is concerned, whether or not there was probable

cause.

(2

was a defective arrest warrant.

We think it is quite immaterial whether

or not there

And we go one step further.

1 think you again diagnosed the case right on point

13
14

when you say there were two complaints and arrest warrants

IS

issued, one for the burglary of the Rustic Bar, and the other,

16

which he was actually tried on, the arrest of the hardware

!7

store.
Now, in Wyoming, we currently have adopted the

18
19

Criminal Rules of Procedure, which are patterned after the

20

federal rules.

21

under some old statutes that are not unique or different

22

throughout the country, they are quite similar to many other

23

states, and it is simply this, that a complaint is filed

24

usually by a law enforcement officer; based upon that complaint

25

an arrest or search warrant is issued.

But at this time in Wyoming we were operating

16
1

The arrest is made and

I

information is filed which is in lieu of a grand jury hearing.
At a preliminary hearing probable cause is determined and the
sequence is immediately.
Whiteley was arrested on the 24th,

that evening.

On

the 25th, the next morning, the arrest warrant and the criminal
complaint were filed against him, the information was filed and
a preliminary hearing was held before a magistrate in Rollins,
f

Wyoming to determine whether or not there was probable cause.
With probable cause'being found, it was set for trial, and
again the jury found' that there was probable cause beyond a
reasonable doubt that he committed the crime.

When was the car searched, before or after?

Q

That is what the proposition, is, isn’t it?

11

A

12

Q

«

Yes.

In fact --

Is that the critical proposition here,

that the

tz

arresting officer hears over the radio that he is supposed to

14

arrest a man, he can arrest him?
A

15

That is not the critical proposition, Justice

16

White.

The critical proposition is whether or not there was

17

probable cause.

18

Q

19

A

20

Somewhere in the police department?
Yes.

And the probable cause existed, as the

record bears it out, that —

21

Q

Well, what was it?

22

A

Well, simply the fact that the particulars de­

23

tailed in the police broadcast that they were looking for a

24

man, we described the man, we are looking for a car, we

25

describe the car, we are looking for certain —

Q

So you Eire saying that the probable cause was

that contained in the police broadcast and that is all the

3

resting officer needed?

4

A

Right.

Q

Now,

Right.

let's assume that the officer who put out

the broadcast himself had no probable cause to put it out.

Yes.

You see, we have

acted on reliance on Draper and other decisions of this Court

14

that you can make a warrantless arrest if you have probable

cause.

Now at this late date --

16

Q

There is no doubt about that.

17

Q

But you have to have facts which show there is

18

probable cause, and what are the facts that Ogburn had which

19

this record discloses from which we may make the inference

20

that they had probable cause?

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

20

HR, KNDDSEH:

2!

Q

May it pleas© the Court -~

Mr. Knusden,

I observe in the record that this

22

man had served siss penitentiary sentences for various things

2$

and that his prior convictions are what led to a life sentence

24

as a Habitual criminal.

25

A

Yes.

35

1

Q

X suppose as a practical matter that explains

2

why the ease is here*

3

h

I think so, Your Honor.

We in the defender aid

4

program like to get involved in knotty questions, but we don’t

5

take merely academic questions.

8

two years ago or so, I don't think we would be here today, but

7

it is mandatory «*» a life sentence is mandatory in Wyoming if

8

you are convicted as an habitual criminal.

If Whiteley had been released

Q

And how many convictions does that take?

fl

h

I think it takes three, Your Honor.

IZ

Q

- Three?

13

A

Three.

14

May I proceed0 Your Honor?

15

Q

16

A

-

How

many -~

He had more than three.

Yes..
1 would like to make a couple of points here. 3

27

think in the heat of argument my good friend, Jack Speight„

18

said something which is not completely accurate on the finger­

19

prints.

20

taken any fingerprints and he said no, he couldn't get any

2!

fingerprints of any kind, and I just think that was one of the

22

things made in the heat of battle.

On page 54 of the appendix Ogburn was asked if he-had

:

1 would like to address myself to the Draper point,

23
24

if I may.

Thera is absolutely nothing in the record to show

25

that • — anything, except that there was a tip.
36

There was

I

nothing in the record to show that the tipster told Ogburn that

2

he saw

3

and so on.

4

did it* and 1 submit to the Court, in the absence ©f this in­

5

formation,

6

make the assumption that then Ogburn said,, well,

1

Whlfceley well,

8

cetera, efc cetera, and he put this out*

9

that he recognised the man with a tattoo on his arm,
-A31 he had is that the tipster told him Whlteley

the absence of this in the record, X think we must
I know

he is si* feet tall, he is 47 years old.

efc

Now, as I say, I am making an assumption, but 1 think

10

the other assumption is equally bad to say that the tipster

11

gave him this infornation about Whlfceley.

12

say they had the burden of proof, and therefore they haven't

13

proven it.

14

Q

We don't know, and 1

Well, Mr. Speight argued, among ether things,

15

that when this issue was up,

1©

therefore you have waived the infirmities in probable cause

17

by not pursuing.

18

that, I am asking you to respond to that argument,

19

have waived that »~

Wow,

it was not challenged and that

this is not my

X don't think there was a way.
Ho. 2883,

original proceeding.

once the attorney for Whlfceley

22

said how did you get this information, and he said X got it

23

from a tipster, he should have pursued it.

24

Q

Right.

A

Each attorney practices differently.

X think X

3

I would’have gone into it to find out where he got it, who the

4

informant was, asfeed the court to make him tell us who the in­

S

formant was, was he reliable, efc cetera, efc cetera.

In fact, I would have probably filed a
But once this occurred„

This did

The absence ©£ a motion to suppress has deprived

a

the trial court right from the beginning of an opportunity to

9

pass on this question at the time when it could have been

10
11

passed on.
A

Yes, Your Honor, but 1 think that if a lawyer

12

does fail to move to suppress, that he perhaps can raise this •

13

at the trial level with the court's permission.

14

courts -- I was an assistant XI.S. attorney at one time, and on

15

occasion X would have fisjed when the judge would permit this

16

at a trial when no motion to suppress had been made.

17

think here it could have been raised at the trial if the court

IS

permitted,and he permitted the question was how did you get

19

the information; 1 got it from a tip, and then the whole thing

20

died and they ---

25

Q

And X

Well, was there any objection to the evidence

at the trial?
A

Yes, there was an objection to the evidence, yes

on the grounds that it was an illegal search and seizure.
Q

And 1 gather under Wyoming procedure this may be
38

?

raised by objection to the evidence at the trial even though no

2

motion to suppress is made .before the trial?

3

h

1 believe so. Your Honor,

The stales wer©

4

changed and I actually never tried any eases in Wyoming, but

5

there was no objection by the county attorney to the objection

6

by the defense attorney,

7

Q

In other words, opposition to the objection i?as

8

not made on the ground that no motion to suppress had been

9

made before the trial?

10

a

Right, Your Honor*

n

Q

And once he said ~~ once he brought out that it

.

12

was from a tip, he had negative personal knowledge on the part

13

of the officer?

matter was just droppeda nothing -Q

16

A

Isn’t that

I think so, Your Honor,

I think at that point

I know, but isn’t that enough?

enough for the defense to have —

Once he asked him if it came out by a tip, the

Q

Would you have gone ahead and built the state’s

case for them?

22

A

If I had been the county attorney then I would

23

have certainly proven that it ms a reliable informant, efc

24

cetera.

23

1 would like to say just on this Draper question
39

1

that — I have set it forth Ik my reply brief, but two things

about Draper.

reliable informant there.

fchinR for that reason Draper falls.

5

case, Mr. Justice Harlan says* and X am quoting from page 11»

6

that it is especially important that the tip describe the

7

accused criminal activity in sufficient detail so the magistrate

8

may know that he is relying on something more substantial than

9

a casual rumor circulated in the underworld or an accusation

10

One* Draper was a reliable informant.

We had a

based merely on an individual general reputation.

1!

X really think we have got a reputation case here

12

because everybody in Wyoming knew that Whites Icy had four or

13

five convictions, and I think that is what done him in.

14

15

Q

Don01 you think somebody had told the sheriff

something'afc out him?
ft

®hs yes.

X don4t say the sheriff was perjuring

20

Whiteley was there* fchafc might be plenty.

22

I would turn my back and say lefc^s see, Ogburn ~~ Wbifceley is

One' final points

I ara sure that that was added, Your Honor.
We stipulated to the record in

tions*

was more interested in those.

9

cision on it, and so did the Tenth Circuit.

This question always was in the case.

We had questions

G

Well, if you win you -- the case will just foe

19

reversed, wouldn’t it?

29

A

In my opinion, Your Honor, if this case is re­

21

versed and sent back to Rawlins, the county attorney will have

22

to see.what evidence he has.

23

dence he has is the goods, the fruits that he found in the car

24

and Daley’s testimony.

25

Q

As far as I Know, the only evi­

Welle X gather the forum anyway, if you prevail.
41

1

would be to send it back fco the district court to give the

2

state an opportunity to give him another trial or else release

3

him.

Isn't that it’?
A

4

Well,

I think it should be sent back to the

S

district court and the district court should be ordered to

order a new trial in the state court.

X don't --

to give him a new trial or release him,

yes,

13

but’I.don't think we should rehash all the facts in the

county attorney has two things, what he found in the ear and
