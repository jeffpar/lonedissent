MR.

VIETH:

!1r.

Justice Black, <llld may it please

the Court:
The issue in this Cl!se, tile 1.road issue, is whether

to

the Comptroller of the Cu:i.·rency has author:Lty to permit

11

national banks to operate co ,1ingled investment funds for

12

managing agency accounts, such as the fund involved in Number

13

59 which has just been argued, notwithstanding the provisions

o'€ the 1933 Glass-Steagall legislation as amended.
!5

However, since it app~ars to be conceded all around

16

that the ordinary open-end mutual fund which I shall describe

17

in just a moment, is proh~bited by the Glass-Steagall legisla-

18

tion from engaging in the banking business, and conversely, the

!9

banks are prohibited fi:om oparating a garden variety of tradi-

20

tional open··end mutual funds.

2!

The narrow issue before the Cou1.t, we submit, is

22

whether, in sum and substance, u comingled invest.-nent account

23

24

will be discussed in this ca~e, whether such an

The Petitioners in tt,is case, are the Investment

nULlber of individual rnembero of that institute.

The action was brought in the Dist:cict Court against

tu ctll banks, state or national, me;nbers or nonmembers of the

22

Federal Reserve System.

23

Section 21 requires the complete divorce of the business of

24

001111nercial banking fro.n the husin~ss -- from the securities

25

business.

In the broadest possible language,

It prohibits the simultaneous engagement inthe

business of receiving deposits subject to withdrawal by check
or other means, which namely i~ the business of commercial

3

banking and engaging at the same time in the business of

4

issuing or underuriting or sel:.ing or distribu-..:ing stocks,

5

bonds, debentures, notes or other securities.

6

Section

,.s

of !:he National Banking Act is also

7

relevant.

8

indeed, is the provision of the National Bankinq Act which sets

9

forth the corporate powers of: national banks.

It, however, applies

~nly to national banks, and

In doing so, it

10

enacted two limitations, or I beg pardon, l:wo exceptions to

11

t.~e broad provisions of the other provisions of the Glass-

12

Steagall Act.

1.3

It did first permit an.,., .t!ori.:cl! national bank to

14

underw-cita and sell a strict).y limited lis'i: of government bonds,

15

And secondly, it eY.pressly confirmed the right of all national

16

banlts, whether or not they exercised trust powers, to perform

17

an acCOlll:IIOCi&tion service for customers by permitting banks to

ts

purchase. and sell securities solely upon the order and for the

19

account of customers and not for the acount of the bank.

20

refer to this as an accommodation service.

2t

history makes it clear and the contemporaneous publications of

22

the Comptroller of the Currency of 1933 and '34 make it clear

23

that this service was intended for the smallerbanks located in

24

smaller communities where the ordinary oervir.:e

25

dealer were not available.

5

'l')1at was tha second exception p~:ct1U.tt:ed by Section

employee of a member bank.
Section 20 prohibited certain defined affiliations

22

between member banks on the one hand and corporations engaged

23

principally in the issue, flotation, unden,riting, and so forth

24

of stocks and bonds.

25

So, Sections 32 and 20 were intenaed to prohibit
7

1

indirect violations of the broad prohibition of Section 21.

2

Now, as I have previously indica.ted, we believe tha~

3

the narrow issue before the Cour'; is whether a bank comingled

.l!-

investment fund of the '.;ype here unaer cons~.deration, is, in

5

awn and substance, a n:ui:ual fund,

6

by the Federal Reserve B~ard that a traditio~ 1

7

is subject to the ~lass··Ctoag:ill Act; that the activity of a

8

traditional mutual fund is the kind of activity contemplated

g

by the Glass-Steagall Act.

10

It has bt>en repeatedly helc.1

No.~, this fact s~eM to be conceded

1.u 1 _1r..

11

around.

11

seems to be conceded that a baru:, as I say, may not operate a

12

traditional mutual fund, nor nay a traditional l'"'ltua:!. fund go

13

into the banking business.
So then we c:,:na to the que tion: is there

14

!1

It,

sig-

15

nificant difference bet11een tnis fund and a traditional mutual

16

fund or are they, are he cont~nds,

17

with clarity, I should like to stre~s several of the character-I

19

istics of traditional mutual fund3 and demonstr~te how the co-

20

Q

A

It is, as we indicated in our reply brief,

20

for First National City Bank, it typically advertises its

21

trust department rather extensively.

22

and regulations of the Securities and Er.change Commission, it

23

may not advertise the availability of this fund except in a

24

very limited way, and in a way that's limited to all mutual

25

funds.

Hawever, under the rules

Q

you have appended a couple of advertisemen_s, but they are not

5

A

6

Tt.e1 are not -- no, sir.

Mr. Justice, the

7

purpose of

incl..idir.g thooe was .:.o rebut the claim made by

0

First National City that participations in this ~und would only

9

be offered in the context of the very conservative offering

to

of the traditional fiduciary services, as ~f ac.c'l\enow or other

11

that differentiated this fund from an ordinary mutual fund.
The feet of the matter is that an ordinary mutual

i2
13

fund is very strictly limited to the type of advertising it

14

can do and as the appendix indicates, the appendix to our reply

15

brief, a ban~ trust department i5 under no such limitations.

16

We think it was very interesting and rather flamboyant adver-

17

tising and for that reason, CDlled it to the attention of the

13

Court.
Q

19

But, this is not an advertisement, of course,

that we are talking about he~e.

20

A

21

This is sanething else.

It's an ad•1ertiseMent of the other trust

MR. COX:

1,:-. Justice Dlack,

&"'l,

ii:' 1.t please the

Court:

7

In this ca;e, as in the one before it, we start

a

with the unanimous conclusior. of all the e .•p r • regulatory

9

agencies that what the bank is doing is car.rying on a somewhat

10

new form of a traditional b-'lking function which is not pro-

11

hibite<i. by ex5.sting law &nd •ihich is in the public interest

12

because it provides a tradilionul lo.nd of serv;;.ce ,,;; lower

13

cost a. d supplies co ,1peti tion foi: wh<J.t would otherwise be the

14

monopolistic position of the mutual funds.

15

So that he4e again, the general question involved

16

is whether Petition° shave carried the very heavy burden of

17

showing that the agen"Y'S concJ.u..,ions are so unreasonable or

In the first place I emphasize again the individual

the only evidence I could find in the recoi·d, • hich is created
between them.
Second, the fiduciary duties in Regulation 9 and in

characterize this relationship.

The bank is not pennitted to

have ac,y interest in the account· it's not pert!'.itted to deal

14

Q

What page is that on?

15

A

That's on page 4-A of the appendix to our

16

17

brief.
What it says

that a commercial banker may not do,

18

i~ engage in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling and

19

djstributing, at whol•sale or retail, through syndicate parti-

20

cipation, stocks, bond!l or. other sec•lri ties.

21

Now,

t submit thr.t those uords are plainly directed

22

at a bank's purchasing and selling of securities as investments

23

for it~ own account, and that a bank'G actinq as middleman, in

And I would .:mawer that the uni ts of pa1·ticipation

10

affect the matter.

11

which the banlc accounts to its customers for

The units ~re simply t:1e mechanisms by

Second, we: woula cn.phasize that the temptation

17

which the cow:t below put on the G..ass-steagall Act,. and wbi.,:,h

ta

we urge here, the bank's engaging in i:his activity, is in no

They were first to p--:-event a bank from

r.isking :!.ts own assets .i.n e:,ecurities, especialJ.y speculative
securities and of course, the bank has no assets at risk here.
Second, they intended to prevent banks from exhausting securities and then endanqering their solvency by
making loans to bai. out th~t invest.,ient.

And since the bank

ha~ nothing at risk here, that temptation doesn't exist.

19

think it's no exaggeration to say that the Petitioners do not

20

cite a single substantive objection to the account that is not

21

equally applicable to all the other fiduciary activities that

22

are undertaken pursuant to Section 92a, and certainly are not

23

nff cted by Glasa-ste~gall.

Indeed, I

And fina!ly, I would urga that there is no basis at
25

a~l for the Petitioners' 1najor premise here: the assumption tha

1

activities subject to i:he 1nveatment Company Act must somehow

2

be prohibit d to banks by the Class-Steagall Act.

3

follow.

That doesn't

The two may, and indeed we urge, do overlap.

As

Judge Bazelon said, the acts have differen. policies: they
5 11

61

deal w:i.th different. subj cts and no1:hing in c,ither suggests the
i ..onic conclusion th t I mentioned before ..uncn on, that a

custom rs, the benefit of

becomes unla,:cul if you do, which, as X say, is indeed ironic.

11

Now, the P

t'on

argument, as I understand it,

r duces itself somewh .t to a syl:!.oqism and in the sense, I
13
4
t5

think Mr. Vieth ass11;,.1 · . ~arge part of th~ answer to the case,
i

his first statemant during the argllltlent this morning.
The syll-,g;.run is: the bank, everybody concedes that

16

a mutual fund engages in the kinds of activities·in ~hich a

17

bank cannot engage and with •1h!ch it cannot be affiliated·

i8

under the Class-S~eagall Act.

19

.inor pram~se: Citibank's account is engaged in the

20

same activities as a mutual fund and then the conclusion is that

21

we viol,.te the Class-Steagall Act.

22

Now, wa deny both the major and the minor preaises,

23

and if we are rigllt on either count, then we're right in our

24

conclu~ions.

25

fund, certainly a "no load" •nu.:ual fund, is enq ged in

in the first place we do not concede that a mutual

56

1

2

activities of a kind with which a bank cannot be connected
under the Glass-Steagall Act.
The Petitiorc:;:s, un'cil this case, were arguing just

3

4

the opposite and I think the J.og:i.c of a good many of the

5

arguments in our brief is that they were right the first time.

6

The Federal Reserve Bo,,rd h~s ru~.ed to the cort:rary in the

7

case of the ordinary mutual fund, but that i3n't the end of the

a

matter and I respectfully submit that that ian't

9

begin the deci.sion of this ca&0 by assuming the correctness of

10

the Federal Reserve Board conclusions instead of going back, as

11

I have tried tc do, to the words of the statute and to its

f2

bas le policy.

reason to

Now, second: even if the ordinary mutual fund is

13

14

engaged in the kind of activities with -- which is forbidden

15

to the bank or with which it is forbidden to be t'Onnected,

16

still we say that the Citibank's account is not in violation

17

of the Glass-Steagall Act beca.use we think i·c 's a markedly

18

The Federal Reserve Board through the years, and

16

the bankers' rlli.lnuals, have repe~tedly urged against thatkind
of a situation.

Indeed, we cite in our reply brief a ruling

which dealt with a very similar situation.

In that case a
