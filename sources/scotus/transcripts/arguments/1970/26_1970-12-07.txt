ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELIZABETH B„ DUBOIS, ESQ.

5
6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MRS. DUBOIS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

7

Court. This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of

8

Wisconsin. It involves the criminal conviction of Father James

9

E. Groppi for resisting arrest during the civil rights demon­

10

11

stration which took place in August of 1967.
At issue is the constitutionality of the Wisconsin stat­

12

ute which prohibited the change in venue in Father Groppis1

13

case because he was charged with a misdemeanor rather than a

14

felony.

15

The facts of the case, briefly stated, are as follows:

16

Father Groppi, a Roman Catholic priest, advisor to the NAACP

17

youth council has been an active civil rights leader for a num­

10

ber of years in Milwaukee. He was arrested on August 31, 1967.

19

He was charged with resisting arrest, a misdemeanor punishable

20

under Wisconsin lav; by a maximum of one year and a $500 fine.

21

He was convicted after a jury trial,, on February 9, 1968.

22

The testimony at trial is laid our in some detail in our brief,

23

is significant in two respects. First it is clear that the ac­

24

tivities from which his criminal charge arose are considered

25

crimes of major porportions by the People of Milwaukee, what-

4

I

ever the technical classification of the crime in which he

2

was charged.

3

Tims the defendants8 arrest ocurred in the course of a

4

civil rights march, protesting a proclamation issued by the

5

mayor of Milwaukee banning all marches and demonstrations from

8

4:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. for a thirty day period.

7

That proclamation had itself been issued in response to

8

a series of civil rights demonstrations, marches, and activities

9

participated in by Father Groppi and the youth council. The

10

testimony is also significant in that the States and the Def­

11

enses' versions of the facts essential to his guilt or immocence

12

on the resisting arrest charge were in basic conflict. The

13

States' witnesses tesrified that while Father Groppi was being

14

carried in a limp position to the police wagon, he kicked the

15

policeman who was carrying him by the left leg, meanwhile

16

shouting a profanity. Defense witmesses testified that that

17

same officer had gouged Father Groppis' leg and that it was in

18

response to that that Father Groppi demanded his name and badge

19

number. The Defense denied that there had been any kicking and

20

any profanity.

21

The defendant moved prior to trial for a change in venue

22

on the grounds that massive and prejudicial news coverage that

23

he had recieved as a civil rights leader and in connection with

24

this case in Milwaukee County had created community prejudice

25

preventing an impartial jury trial in that county. He asked for
5

1

an opportunity to proove the nature and extent of that news

2

coverage and its effect on the community and on the liklihood

3

of an impartial trial in that county»

4

This motion was denied without an evidenfcury hearing on

5

the sole ground that the Wisconsin statute at issue prohibited

3

a change of venue in misdemeanor cases» The defendant charged

■7

a

the validity and constitutionality of-Qo

At this point did the statute in so many terms pro­

hibit the change in venue in misdemeanor cases?

10

JL

Today, Your Honor, or at the time of——

n.

Q.

Then» At that time»

12

A

At that time the statute as interpreted by the trial

13

court in its terms prohibited» The trial court interpreted it

U

very specifically to prohibit change of venue» It was on that

15

ground that it denied the motion. The Supreme Court of Wiscon­

16

sin, in its opinion, again interprets that statute to absolutely

17

prohibit change in venue in a misdemeanor casa»

18

19
20

0.

The statute certainly does not mention misdemeanors,

does it?
K

It does not mention it» It says only that in a felony

21

case a change in venue may be allowed, but the Wisconsin Sup­

22

reme Court opinion specifically says both that the motion was

23

denied on the ground that the statute provided for change in

24

venue only in felony matters, that's 208 of the record, and then

25

the Supreme Court itself said the applicable statute specifies

6

1

2
3
4

that a change in venue based on community prejudice shall only
be permitted in felony cases c
0.

Is there a constitutional right to a change in venue

in any kind of a case? Fully apart from the statute?

5

A. .

Your Honor, it's our contention that-—

6

Q,

On sufficient showing of community prejudice»

7

A,

On a sufficient showing of community prejudice, a

8

change of venue may be constitutionally required and that this

9

statute is subject to duo process challenge» Because it absol-

to

utely prohibits change of venue without even according a right

n
n
13

to hearing in which one can show the kind of community prejud­
ice that would justify a change of venue»
0,

You can sense I'm struggling with the question of

14

why the Wisconsin Court interpreted its statute in the way it

IS

did when it didn't refer, make any mention to misdemeanor

16

cases whatsoever»

17

A

Maybe it's because the statutee the language of the

18

statute seems to assume that no change of venue exists except

19

for the

20

a change of venue is allowed in a felony case» And Wisconsin

21

itself recognised a federal due process right to change of ven­

22

ue, only after the statute had been enacted»

23

£X

statute and that it§ because of the statute that

Is it possible, Mrs» DuBois* that you might have a

24

situation where the original jurisdiction having a special mis­

25

demeanor court coneievable there might be no other place where
7

i
2
3
4
'5
6
7
8

9

they had a comparable court» What would that do to your ar­
gument? What would that do with respect to this problem?
A.

You mean that in a particular county, for example,

in Wisconsin there might be a special misdemeanor court that
other counties—Q.

There might be no other misdemeanor court anywhere

else in the state, in some states»
A.

It seems to me, Your Honor, that if there was a show­

ing in such a case that commumity prejudice was such that it

to

was impossible to try that, misdemeanor in that county that the

It

state would simply ha?e to provide some means of trying him in ^

12

another county. The fact that a specific misdemeanor court did

13

not exist it seems to me would not be a barr to that. Certainly

14

another court, would be able to try the case. Or the state court

15

would simply havs the burden of providing some means of trying

16

it somewhere else. If it was going to try the case at all.

17

Q.

While I have you interrupted, what impact, if any,

13

is there from the fact that the Wisconsin legislature has row

13

extended the change of venue provisions to cover misdemeanor

20

cases, as I understand it?

21

A.

Your Honor, I don't think there's any impact ai all

22

in this case, because the Wisconsin statute that changed the

23

law which we refer to in the reply brief, page 2, footnote 1

24

specifically makes that change in the law prospective only. T>*e

25

section we quote there applies to the entire newly revised
8

!

criminal procedure code , and it says that the code shall gov­

2

ern proceeutions commenced on or after July

3

the prosecutions commenced praor to July .1, 1970, shall Sje

4

governed by the law existing prior thereto,, This prosecution .

5

was commenced prior to that date, the trial itself was in 1968»
0.

6

1970«, It says

Mrs. DuBois does the record show , -1 wish to be sure

7

as to this, whether there was any offer of proof as to comm­

e

uni ty pre judiee?
A.

9

Yes, Your HOnor. On the original motion for a change

10

of venue, which appears in the appendix at pages 23-25, the

11

defendant offered, he asked the Court to take judicial notice

12

of the massive news coverage of this defendant and of this

13

particular case. And in addition he proffered proof as to the

14

nature and extent of the coverage and as to the effect on the

15

community. The motion was denied out of hearing. The specific

16

grounds the judge agve were not that inadequate evidence had

17

been produced but that the Wisconsin statute prohibited a

18

change of venue.

19

S.

0

Does the fact that the jury v/as expeditiously sel­

20

ected weigh against that any suggestion of community pi?©-

21

jucEice?

22

A

Well, I don't believe that it does because our con­

23

tention that, change of venue may in some cases depending on

24

the circumstances be constitutionally required because voir

25

dire and continuance and other available meghods would simply
9

i

not be adequate to protect the defendants right to an impartial

2

jury trial« Therefore, the fact that in the particular case

3

voir dire may have been expeditiously dispatched doesn’t affect

'4

the constitutional claim. The premptory challenges were all

5

exercised in this case and ther's simply no way of telling

8

what else went on at the voir dire.

7

8
9

0

Do you know whether under Wisconsin procedure coun­

sel has the right to question prospective jurors?
fl.

Well, Counsel has the right to question prospective

10

jurors » The state makes the argument that the defendant had

11

an opportunity <_o s.i^ .

12

on voir dire or on a motion for a continuance, or on a iT-^ion

13

for a new trial, and its the failure to do this that deprives

.14

prejudice in this case, either

him of — . Our answer to that is that his claim is that the

IS

circumstances < re such that only a change of venue can protect

16

his right to an impartial trial.

17

There is no reason that he should be required topursue

18

remedies which he considers inadequate in order to get a re­

19

cord of community prejudice. And we contend this is so par­

20

ticularly because pursuit of those remedies might involve

21

waiver of vital constitutional rights and might be fruitless

22

in particular, both with continuance and with voir dire.

23

Continuance under Wisconsin law, had the defendant moved

24

tor a continuance, he would have waived his right to a speedy

.25

trial. Secondly the kind of proof he might have been able to
10

«

get in on a. motion for a continuance would have meant that he

2

would indeed have been able to get a fail? trial in Wisconsin,

3

eventually, and it“s that very thing that he's claiming he

4

could not gefc„

5

As far as voir dire is concerned, he is

allot-zed under

6

Wisconsin law to ask questions of particular jurors, presum­

7

ably it is with respect to whether or not they have heard

3

particular information or seen things» But he would not be al­

9

lowed to bring in outside witnesses to show that the community

?0

as a whole is exposed to prejudice, which is the kind of evidence

11

that this Court found in Ridsau was relevant» In Rideau this

12

Court found that it was not the exposure of the three jurors

13

that was shown on voir dire that was relevant, they found it

14

was the exposure of the community as a whole. In voir dire there

15

would be no way, in Wisconsin or i.n any jurisdiction that I

16

know of, that the defendant could show that kind of exposure

17

of the community as a whole.

13

W
20

He would be limited to showing simply the exposure of
particular jurors»
0.

Mrs» DuBois, what do you say about the States' point

21

that there was no prima facie shown in the motion, there was

22

just general conslusions?

23

A.

Well, the defendant is faced with a statute which

24

prohibited, as Wisconsin courts had interpreted it, prohibited

25

a change of venue» He did make conr’»anrv allegations-11

1
2
3

0„

Is there any rule of Court or lav? in Wisconsin that

says you can't file exhibits to a motion?
A.

No, Your Honor, he could have, and he did in fact file

4

an affadavit which is in the record , and he did also ask the

5

Court to take judidial notice of the news coverage which many

6

Courts have in this kind of ease,, considered news coverage of

'7

the being attached, but the most important thing—i

8
9
10

U

CX

Could you have put into the record what he wanted the

Court to take judicial notice, namely the clippings that he
said were so inflammatory?
A.

Well, Your Honor, two answers. He could have put

12

some of the clippings into the record, but he was denied any

13

opportunity to bring in witnesses, which is another important

14

way of showing community prejudice. He was denied any oppor­

15

tunity .

IS

17
18
19

20
21

22

Q.

But was he denied the opportunity to put in a thous­

and affadavits or fourty five hundred clippings, was he?
A.

No, he wasn't Your Honor, but that may be an inade­

quate way of showing community prejudice.

Q.

Well, I mean, doesn't the Court have some control

over the fact that he wants prima facie shown?
A.

I agree. If either the trial court or the Supreme

23

Court of Wisconsin had ruled that his failure to get community

24

prejudice into the record had anything to do with his failure

23

to produce proof on the change of venue motion, but neither
12

of them went on those grounds,,

probiting change of venue» He came in and proffered proof and

akked theCourt to take judicial notice» He also attached a

14

were inadequate. If the Court had said at that paint that thes?

Well, that9s what I thought you were saying» You didn

want a complete reversal, and turn him loose, did
(No response)
Q,

1 understood you to say that it wasn’t clear in this

tz

case that'a change of venue in a misdemeanor ease in this state

13

was completely unpermlssable, That it was only in this case

'14

15

and that the decision of the trial court and then, the subse­
quent affirmance in the State Supreme Court that it became

16

clear. That the rather ambiguous language of the state statute

17

meant in only felony cases could you get a change of venue and

18

that they were absolutely forbidden in misdemeanor cases,

19

A.

It has never bean held by the Supreme Court of Wis­

20

consin, but X believe that it was commonly understood, by

21

Counsel in Wisconsin, that this was not allowed, that changes

22

of veraue were not allowed in misdemeanor cases, and this is

23

that the language of the statute is that ambiguous because it

24

presumes that no change of venue is allowed.

25

of venue in a felony case-15

It permits change

i

Q.

Well, maybe by implication? I suppose,, but 1 thought

2

you'd agreed earlier with Justice Blackmun when he said the

3

statutory language wasn't all that clear? and now in your re™

4

sponses to Mr» Justice Marshall you say that the reason that

5

a better factual case wasn't put in for a change of venue was

6

that Counsel for the defendant knew he had a hopeless case

7

anyv/ay because clearly there couldn't be a change of venue»

3

It seemed to be a little inconsistent» I wondered what you——

9

JL

I think that the statute and that the practice in

10

Wisconsin was fairly clear» That no change of venue would be

ii

allowed in this case, and I think he produced adequate proof,

12

in any event an adequate proffer of proof so that the judge

13

should either have said this is not enough evidence or allowed

14

him to have an evidentury heareng»

15

0-

Well if, going back to a point raised before, if there
0

16

was that ranch community prejudice wouldn't it normally be a

17

matter that Counsel would explore very extensively in examining <

18

the jurors?

19

persons that had been tainted by that excessive coverage that

20

you claim?

21

A.

To be sure that he had eliminated such of those

There is no way of telling exactly what kind examin­

22

ation that was made in this case but under Wisconsin law? as

23

under the law in most jurisdictions, the juror who has been

24

exposed to prejudicial news coverage may stay on the jury so

25

long as he can tell the judge that he has not formed an irrevoc-

16

1

able opinion that the defendant is guilty»
■

z

Q.

Did you make a motion for a new trial, Counselor?

3

JL

Your Honor, yes, after the motion for a change of

4

venue there x<?as a. motion before trial to dismiss challenging

5

this statute» There was also a motion for a new trial after­

6

wards challenging the statute and in both cases the-—

7

0,

But did you ask, in your motion for a new trial, to

8

submit any

9

A,

evidence with respect to community prejudice?

At that

stage there was no evidence submitted, but

10

again, our argument is that the reasons that it8s unnecessary

11

to submit evidence, or that it's unfair to require the defen­

12

dant to get new evidence in at that stage is because it would

13

be fruitless,

14

In the first place—

15

Q,

The Court, I take it, the Wisconsin Court said that

16

they certainly weren't holding that you didn't have a right to

17

a fair trial»

18

A.

They say that Your Honor—

W

Q,

And that on a motion for a new trial that if there

20

had been evidence of strong community prejudice you could have

21

condluded—

22

A.

They say that, but this is the firs tease in which

23

they've indicated in any way that the way to get change of venue

24

on community prejudice into the case is on a motion for a new

25

trial and there are several cases indicating that the standard
17

1

for reversal on an unfair trial theory is entirely different

a

from the standard on a vhange of venue»

3

In 'the case of State vs» NutXey, which we cite in our

4

brief, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court case, they described

5

the two different standards very specifically» They describe

6

there that the standard on a cliange of venue motion is whether

7

there

8

of the jurors» They describe the standard on the reversal for

9

an unfair trial

'judice which might color the perceptions

as whether the publicity was such that thfc

10

jurors could not help but predetermine the guilt of the def­

n

endant»

12

Qt

What do you think the condfcititional standard is?

S3

ft.

I certainly don3t think it's the second, and I donrt

14

think this Court has made it quite clear in these cases that

15

it would not be a standard that the jurors clearly couldn51

36

help but predetermine the guilt of the defendant.

37

The other problem with introducing this evidence on a mo­

18

tion for a new trial and the other reason that it would be

‘19

fruitless is that there8s no indication that a change of venue

20

would be possible in Wisconsin even if such a motion were won.

Zi

Q.

Suppose the trial judge, at the conclusion Of the

22

trial, after he had seen the whole panorama, decided that this

23

cluld have been a miscarriage of justice because of community

24

feeling permeating the jury» He might then, on some broad

25

ground, independent of the statute, decide to grant a. new trial

18

I
2

Isn't that so?
£,

He might decide to grant a new trial, but a new trial

3

in the same community. I think that given this Wisconsin stat­

4

ute denying change of venue, that there would be no possibility

5

of their granting a change of venue and its our obvious con­

6

tentiori in this case-- I mean, it*s Groppis contagion in

7

this case that a simple — I mean, granted a new trial under

3

fchise circumstances would really be the same as granting a

9

continuance» That's his contention» That that would be an

!0

inadequate remedy. Because, under the circumstances in this

n

particular case because of his continued civil rights activity,

tz

because the prejudice really resulted from his notoriety as

13

a parson, not from the facts of the particular crime.

14

There's no reason to believe that the prejudice would

15

disappear. In any event, our only real contention is that he

16

was entitled at least to a hearing to show that a continuance

17

would not have been an adequate remedy.
. *

13

I'd just like to point out that the two cases which have

13

really dealt with a statute like Wisconsins both held that on

20

a record where the defendant had' no opportunity to get commun­

21

ity prejudice in the change of venue motion hearing, the cact

22

that there was no community prejudice in the record is irrel­

23

evant.

24
23

I'd like to just briefly discuss the argument. Our basic
argument

is the statute is in violation of the defendants
19

i

rights,, both under the due process and under the equal pro­

2

tection clauses of the Constitutione

3

We start .with the fundamental proposition that a criminal

4

defendant in our system has a right to have his innocence or

3

guilt determined on the evidence by an impartial trier of fact.

6

Whether the case is a felony or a.misdemeanor, a petty or a

7

serious offense., Since Wisconsin law provided that the trier

8

of facts in all criminal cases be a jury, it's our contention

9

that the defendant had a Federal due process right to all pro-

10

ceedures essential to insure that that jury was impartial»

n

The Court below and the State contend that change of

12

venue is only one of several methods of insuring impartiality.

13

Bur ites our contention that the other methods available to toils

14

deal with pretrial publicity have inherent limitations and that

IS

therefore change in venue may under some circumstances be con-

16

stitutionally necessary.

17

Continuance, as 1 said, nay be inneffectivef publicity may

18

revive and because it conflicts with the defendants right to

13

a jury trial.

20

Voir dire may also be ineffective for reasons I've already

2?

described. And also for

reasons that this Court in Rideau re­

22

cognized, In Rideau this Court based its finding that due pre-

23

cess required a change of venue. In that case all the exposure

24

of the community to prejudicial publicity. It specifiaally re­

25

fused to base its finding on a particularized examination of the

02

1

2

transcript of the voir dire procedings«.
If change of venue is required, depending on the circum­

3

stances , by due process, then we contend that it cannot be

4

limited to felony cases» But that there is no rationale for

B

this distinction because as this case indicates, community

6

prejudice may arise from the personality, the notoriety of the

1

individual, rather than the particular crime, and also from the

8

substance of the activities, not just from the technical charge.

That, for instance in the stated ex reh Rico vs Biggs

is absolutely nothing in the record. All that happened was

19

exacfcy what happened in this case, where the defendant came in

and asked for a change of venue, the Court said that it wasn't

21

allowed for, and it was ruled that he at least had a chance to

ARGUMENT OF MR* SVERRE Q„ TINGLUM, ESQ.

4
3

Very well, Mrs» Dubois.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
A

MR. TINGLUMs Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please„

7

I would Ilka first of all just to mention briefly ©hat is

a

a difference of opinion about the statement of facts. The

9

respondent did not take issue in the brief with the statement

10

of facts presented in the appellants brief. The misunderstanding

It

arises in this fashion. That the statement of facts in the
/
appellants brief contains considerable detail of what happened
!
at the trial, what the testimony of ‘this witness was and what

12
13

j

14

the testimony of that witness was. And our disagreement arises

13

'

in that the defendant takes a position that such facts do not

16

have any relevance whatsoever with respect to the issue which

17

the appellant seeks to raise and seeks to have decided by this

18

Court„

19

The ground rules of this Court, as i understand them,

20

and as expressed by this Court in Meany vs. Eollohan and other

2!

cases is that an appellant who seeks reversal of his conviction

22

on the grounds that he has been denied a constitutional right

23

must show that he and not some hypothetical member of the class

24

has been denied,» Now

25

Now the constitutional right that the appellant seeks to
24

I

have vindicated here, is the Sixth Amendment right to trial by

2

an impartial jury. That is, a jury that is not affected by

3

community prejudice to the point where it cannot judge the

4

issues of fact impartially in the case» The constitutional

5

right soughtto be vindicated is not change of venue, but the

6

right to an impartial jury»

7

Now the appellant says that under certain circumstances,

8

and this expression, or something similar to it, is found four

9

different places in the briefs filed fay the appellant, the

10

Court is told that, under certain circumstances a change of

11

venue may be constitutionally necessary even in a misdemeanor

12

case to protect the defendants right to a fair trial by an

13

impartial jury.

14

And the reason, we contend, that the appellant repeatedly

15

says, under some circumstances, this may be constitutionally

16

necessary is because the appellant recognized thet this Court

17

has not been given a factual record, a factual setting, in

18

which the constitutional issue can be decided.

19

The question that the appellant seeks to raise is cer­

20

tainly an interesting one, it's a tantalizing one, there's not

21

much law previous authority on the subject. There will apparently

22

be less in the future because of the trend among the states

23

to grant changes of venue in all criminal cases and nottto

24.

limit the right to change of venue to felonies or capital crimes

25

or make such other distinctions.
25

1

It’s the respondents position that the Court is being

2

asked to give an advisory opinion, and this Court has repeat­

3

edly said in the past that it does not sit to give advisory

4

opinions!

5

Now the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in this case, decided,

8

made the decision on the constitutional issue raised and ar­

7

gued by the parties in that Court, And it3s the respondents

8

position here that the Wisconsin Supreme Court should not have
4r

9
10
11

dons so, Because it did not have a factual record that would
raise the constitutional issue.
No one, to my knowledge raised to the Wisconsin Supreme

12

Court the question of the standing to challenge the consti­

13

tutionality of that statute. The Court, there, had to ,

14

when you look at the record, deal in. abstractions, and this

IS

Court has said, in the pase, specifically refering to United

IS

Pufoluc Workers vs, Mitchell-, as one case, where this Court

17

has said it will not deal in abstractions, but it must be

18

presented with concrete, legal issues in factual settings be­

19

fore it will undertake to decide the constitutionality of a

20

statute,

21

0.

1 had understood the appellants theory to be that

22

since the trial coi.irt denied the motion for a change of venue,

23

not on the ground that there was no sufficient showing cf

24

community prejudice, but rather on the ground that no matter

25

how much community prejudice you may show I cannot and will

12

13
'14

not listen to any evidence along those lines because the stat­
ute of this state absolutely forbids me to grant a change of
venue so any hearing on community prejudice would be a waste
of time for both af us. Therefore, we must assume in this case
that what this case amounts to is a denial of a hearing on
community prejudice and we may perhaps assume that there could
have and would have been an exfcraordi.nary showing of it, right
alonfc the lines of Rideau against Louisiana, but that the
District Court said even assuming that kind of a case, I can't
hear it and won’t hear it because I can't grant a change of
venue, anyway„
It makes it a little bit like that Chicago

censorship

case where there was no evidence, either, really, of what the
movie was, but assuming the very most offensive imaginable

19

Q,

What position did the prosecution take below on this

20
21

question of publicity and burden of proof and the like?
A.

The prosecution at the trial court level took the

22

position that it would, that a change of venue, that the whole

23

question of a change of venue would be a problematic matter for

24

legislative regulation and that the Wisconsin .legislature had

25

only acted to grant a right to change venue in felony cases»
29

t

The prosecution at the trial court level took the position that

z

inasmuch as the legislature had hot granted, extended the right

3

to change of venue in misdemeanor cases, that it would resist,

4

and it did'resist, or oppose the motion for a change of venue.

5

Now, regardless of, 1 feel somewhat at a disadvantage,

6

because here8s the Wisconsin Supreme Court that has decided

7

the very issue that I claim would not he proper for this Court

a

to decide. Here again, this Court has said in the past, in the

9

Tileson case, in Pranfc vs. Board of Public Instruction that

10

this Court will exercise its independent judgement on the

11

question of standing and will not simply follow the lead of

12

a state Supreme Court.

13

The Court has stated the question of standing as being one

14

of whether the defendant has sustained an injury by the stat-

15

tfce that is attacked? by enforcement of the statute that has

16

been attacked. The record in this case, when you compare it

17

with the record in Rideau,

18

Texas, Sheppard vs. Maxwell, the record here doesnst even give

19

this Court an opportunity to say, well, it was even probable, ©i

20

it was even likely that this defendant had to go before a jury

21

from a community that was even probably prejudiced.

Irvin, Irvin vs. Dowd, Estes vs.

»i

22

The facts simply aren't in the record.

23

Q.

24
25

Well, is it possible to say that the prosecution

prevented the presentation of such facts?
&

No sir. I do not believe so. The Wisconsin Supreme
30

1

Court in its opinion said that there was no bar to the pre­

2

sentation of facts at trial court level. And the only thing

3

we find is this affadavit that has been discussed here earlier

4

on pages 24 and 25 which is in very general conclusory terms.

5

NOW----

6

{1

Well, than perhaps I misunderstood your last question.

7

1 thought the state had taken a very positive position as to

8

the availability of a change of venue in a misdemeanor case

9

on grounds of community prejudice.

And, if this is so, is the

IO

state in a position to complain of the deficiency of the re­

11

cord?

12

A.

I believe so and I think I misunderstood your earlier

13

question, and that is why I perhaps should have phrased the

14

answer differently.

15

'The state could not have, that is the prosecution could

16

not have prevented, under any circumstances could not have

17

prevented the defendant from making a record of facts about

18

community prejudice. The opportunity was there for the de­

19

fendant in the first place, to file, as Mr. Justice Marshall

20

has mentioned, to file affadavits, to file exhibits, newspaper

21

clippings, being denied that opportunity, after the first

22

denial of the motion, the defendant had many ofhtr opportunists

23

to introduce the same evidence. A renewed motion for a change

2A

of venue, with exhibits, with affadavits. The defendant had

25

an opportunity to file the same evidence with a motion for

31

!

continuance. It would have been relevant there» The defendant

2

had an

3

would have been relevant on a post trial or post verdict mo­

4

tion for a new trial on the ground of community prejudice»

opportunity to file the same type of evidence which

5

Furthermore, the defendant didn’t avail himself of the

S

opportunity to make a record that courts have traditionally

7

considered of utmost importance, in community prejudice cases»

8

And that is a record on the voir dire examination. There cer­

9

tainly, we know that there’s no request in the record anywhere

10

that the voir dire examination be reported» We have to assume

11

that there fe'as a careful examination of jurors by defense

12

counsel at the trial, but we don’t know. And the blame for

1.3

this can be laid at the door of defense, because it’s the

14

defendss responsibility to make a record if it’s goinfc to

35

stand of a constitutional issue, and hopes to show some re­

IS

viewing court that the defendant was denied a relevant con-

17

stutitional right.

18

&

What was the name of that -- film case, in Chicago?

19

&

I.*:*! not™

20

0,

That’s quite a different area of the law, but I think

21

in this respect there is an analogy, having to do with the

22

right of censors. A movie, any movie, and the plaintiffs in

23

that case deliberately kept out of the record the nature of

24

the movie. And therefore asked the court to assume that it

25

was the worst possible kind of movie and said even on that
32
I

1

assumption our claim is there can be no censorship — . There

2

was absolutely no evidence whatever of the nature of the movies

3

And the case was decided* the constitutional question was de­

4

cided as I remember hy the Three Judge District Court and 1

5

know by this Court, that kind of a record,, 1=6» no record at

8

all»

7

A,

I would say that 1 would -think that that would be

8

just the reverse of our situation» That we have * in this

9

case» Because in that sort of a case* you can safely assume

10

for constitutional purposes that the film was the worst possible

11

kind of garbage. But in this type of case you cannot assume that

12

Milwaukee was aflame with prejudice and.that there were lynch

13

mobs roving the streets and crowds inside and outside the

14

courthouse yelling for the defendants blood.

15

You don't have any of the facts that were presented in

16

the records in the Rideau case* where there had been a tele­

17

vised confession* you don’t have any of the facts that were

18

presented to this Court in Irvin vs. Dowd* or in Sheppard vs.

19

Maxwell»

20
21

22

It seems to be* to me* exactly the reverse. Of that
situation»
Q.

The Court has held that there at least can be sit­

23

uations where in order to comply with the requirements of

24

due process of law* there must be a change of venue. You

25

agree with that?

33

In this case# as I understand it, the state of

16

But you're really not

defending the basic decision

of the State Supreme Court, are you?

17

A.

18

0,

That's the only issue

19

A,

I don't believe it is,

NO o
here, though, isn’t it?
because this Court said that

20

it will exercise its independent judgement on the matter of

21

standing. And that, so that that is a new issue, and we

22

don't have to go to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to look at the

23

basis for their decision, because they didn't decide that

24

issue.

25

Looking at the record# all we know about this case was

34

1

that there was an arrest, '

2

were six; postponements along the way that cannot be laid at

3

the door of either the defense or the prosecution, one of them

4

was caused by a mistrial» But there 'were a number of post­

5

ponements. There was an affidavit of prejudice filed against

6

a judge and it was honored.

7

at the end of August, 1967, there

There were no exhibits filed. There was no renewal of the

8

motion for a change of venue. There was no request of the

9

Court that the voir dire examination be reported. The voir

10

dire was conducted and finished in one half a day, the jury

II

was selected. The state put in its case all in the course of

12

one afternoon. The defense put in its case the following morn­

Was fchereeever a motion made for a continuance based

unfortunate consequences to the defense in the sense of a

Q.

If you make a motion like that, for a continuance,

22
23

you waive &our right to a speedy trial? Is that what you said?
A

That5s correct. And they may have a very valid rea­

24

son for wanting & speedy trial and not wanting a continuance

25

and it was the defendants right to insist on observance of that
35

1

constitutional right to a speedy trial, therefore the def­

2

endant should not bs compelled to make that motion in order

to make a record of community prejudice » That is the defense

is on page 23» The motion is for a change of venue to a com©

13

munity where prejudice against this defendant does not exist

16

but there's no specific county mentioned or requested by the

17

defendant»

18

The record, then, we've examined what’s in the record»

19

But 'that leaves unanswered the basic question» Was there pre­

20

judice in Milwaukee? Was there? Were there lynch mobs? Was

21

there tremendous intensity of feeling in Milwaukee either

22

bearing on this incident or on other incidents in the defendants

23

history?

24
25

Were there crowds? Was there a carnival atmosphere? All
the facts that were presented to this Court in these other
36

t

cases that are relied upon by the defendant, were in the re­

2

cord» But they're not here»

3

We don8t know whether the editorials mentioned in this

4

affadavit, the editorials are described as being sometimes

3

critical or frequently critical,, of the defendant» This is'nt

6

saying that an editorial has condemned this man or has pre­

7

judged him on the issue of his guilt or innocence in this par­

3

ticular case»
Q,

9

I don't recall that the motion identified the source

to

of those editorials as the Milwaukee Journal or the Sentinel?

II

or any other papers»

12

A

No, sir? it did not»

13

&

I don*t understand your argument -because even if they

14

had been in en masse? in great detail, they would not be ad-

15

missable« By your own interpretaiton of the Statute» They're

15

irrelevant»

17

.

A

Obviously? unless the trial judge had been so tre­

18

mendously impressed by this evidence that he would have taken

19

,a more careful look at the statute and decided to construe it

20

differently» But, youAre correct, Mr» Justice Douglas» But»

21

The filings of the affadavits and of the reams of newspaper

22

clippings, if there were such, with the, as an exhibit to be

23

attached to this motion, with these matters of record in this

24

case and would have given,-, the reviewing court an opportunity

25

to look to see whether there was a liklihood that an impartial

•>

!

37

?

jury could not be impanneled to hear this case.

2

Qi,

Well# why should a reviewing court act like a trial

3

court? And look in the first instance at evidence which the

4

trial court has said I won't look at at all, and the trial

5

court does it because of an error of law?

3

court just reverse and remand and have a trial judge take the

7

evidence in the first place?

A,

8
9

Wouldn’t an appellate;

If the issue weren’t a Sixth Amendment question

of whether or not this defendant had a fair trial and a fair

10

tribunal by an impartial jury» The issue raised, and the

11

only basis on which a reversal could be predicated is that the

12

defendant did not have a trial by an impartial jury and so

13

this Court has required in the past even in the Rideau case,

U

and in Sheppard, and in Irvin vs. Dowd, has required that h

15

there be something in the record so that this Court could say

16

this situation was so bad in that community that it’s likely,

17

we don’t ask that--•“
\

18

Q,

Let’s say that this had been a felony case, and the

19

Petitioner wanted a change of venue on the grounds of prejudice

20

and the trial court said awfully sorry, but we don’t listen to

21

evidence like that in this court. We just don’t listen to it.

22

And he says, well, my confession **®s on television. Sorry, we

23

just don’t listen to that, in our court, and he was convicted.

24

And, I suppose you would make the argument, it seems to me

25

like you 'would that unless there’s some evidence in. the record
38

I
E

no appellate court could reverse

A

a

refusal to accept evidence,

Yes, sir, I have to make that argument, and f think

3

that's what this Court would have said in'the Rideau case, for

4

example where there was a televised confession, If the record

S

brought to this Court in the Rideau case had.had nothing in

s

it ©omserning—-

7

Ql

So you're got——

8

A

a televised confession, I don't think this Court

9

would have decided the Rideau case the way it did. If the Court

10

.hadn't known about a televised confession, the Court couldn't

11

have acted the way'it did..,

12
13

0.

So there5s got to be some offer of proof with some

specifics»

14

A

Yes, sir,

15

Q.

May I ask you what, you understand to be meant by the

16

paragraph on page 214a of the opinion? I. f the defendant in

17

the present case, this ie the Supreme Courts, opinion, feels that

18

he is denied a fair and impartial ferial, no such claim has been

19

made in this Court, that the issue can be raised and evidence

20

can be presented in the motion for a new trial based on a

21

denial of a fair and impartial trial, What do you understand

22

that meant?

23

A

I understand that paragraph to mean, Mr, Justice

24

Black, that the co-art was saying if Counsel was convinced that

23

there was serious community prejudice, serious enough to warrant

39

a change of venuef Counsel could have made—
Q,

But it doesn't say "could have"» So you can't.

That9s — yes — I'm sorry. I misunderstood your

question. Yes. fhe court was saying—

the lower court '"now as to whether he ahs been denied a fair—

What, was that?

A.

Within the one year period following the conviction,

U

A,

That time has now elapsed.

15

Q.

But would it elapse .if it were still pending xn the

16

17

A.

Presumably the opportunity to file that motion in

13

the trial court was still there at the time that the Wisconsin

19

Stpreme Court decision was rendered.

20

Q,

You say presumably. Doesn't this record show whether

21

the year had elapsed? Or ©f it had, as Justice Black 'suggested,

22

perhaps the pendancy of the appeal would have suspended that.

Would — the — of that statute. Do you happen to know whether

It would occur to me that the Supreme Court in Wis­

Now the footnote at that very place says that the

3

trial ended on February 9» 1958. And I think the opinion

4

came down during the August tern of 1968. Doesn’t that supply

5

your dates?

A

Yes, the trial did end—

——Page 205a of the record indicates that the opinion

8

of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was the Fourth Day of Feb­

time of'the opinion, one year had not elapsed.

No, it was five days short a year.

Yes.

13

A

With respect to the constitutional question, the due

19

process question,' I believe that in order to, as I have said

20

-before, in order to even reach the question, you have to begin

21

assuming a parade of horrible facts about Milwaukee in February

22

of 1968 which is the respondents position that thisCourt ~

23

should not and has in the past refused to do. There are two

24

cases other than this currant case in the Wisconsin S&p

25

Court that have discussed this Question and they’re both

our position, with respect to the balance of the argument

a

i rely on in my brief- Thank yau.

4

0t

Mrs. Duboisi your time has expired, but we'll extend

that a little so you can offer a rebuttal.

3

a.

All right,

s

Q.

We'll allow you four minutes. Mr. Wilkins—

7

A

Thank you, Your Honor.

8

First, with respect to new trial. I just want to make

9

1

just have a few points to make—-

absolutely clear that under the two cases that we have found

10

dealing with the standards for reversal on the grounds that

n

-the trial was unfair, on a motion after verdict. The standard

12

is entirely different from the constitutionally required stan­

13

dard for a change of venue.

14

One case, the State vs. Nufcley, says that reversal for

15

an unfair trial can be granted only where the publicity was

16

such that the jurors could not help biit predetermine the issue.

17

The other case, in Zilmer vs. State, which' is not cited

18

in our brief,

19

Wisconsin Supreme Court case. It says that you can reverse

20

only if the court is convinced that the defendant should not

21

have been found guilty.

22

its at 159 Northwest Second, 669, its a 1S68

I think the constitutional standard that this Court has

23

defined in cases like Rideau, Irvin, Sheppard, and a number

24

of others is a standard of potential for prejudice, not an

23

extreme liklihood that the defendant would be found guilty.

43

!

Secondly(, on the continuance remedy, I think it's clear

2

that in a case like this, continuance would be inadequate

3
4

unless somebody .'Like Father Groppi is simply to stop the kind
of civil rights activity in which he was engaged and continues

5

to be engagedo

6

Thirdly, in considering the adequacy of the record ©f

7

community prejudice made in this case, I think it's important tc

8

recognize that this is not an entirely new issue that the

9

Court is being asked to decide. That in Rideau this Court made

10

it very clear that change of venue was a constitutionally re­

11

quired method of guaranteeing jury impartiality in certain

12

circumstances,

13
14
15

All we asked for below, and all we're asking for now is
a change to proove those

circumstances.,

Finally, just a few points with respect to the record of

16

community prejudice in this court» I think that it's important

17

to recognize that when the defendants counsel went before

18

the judge in this case, and asked him to take judicial notice

10

of adverse news coverage, it was before that court at that time

20

which had been living for months, indeed, years with publicity

21

abour Father Groppi, not before this Sourt»

22

Secondly, we believe it's fairly common for courts to

23

take judicial notice of, or to be asked to take judicial

24

notice of adverse news coverage, and that if they consider

25

that inadequate, and want to see it, or want some kind of

44

.*

1

showing that, they can ask for a hearing.

z

Thirdly, on the*—

3

Q.

On that point, isn't it the conventional way, if

4

you’re asking the Court to take judicial notice of a whole

5

category, at least to suggest by way of proffer some specific

3

instances?.

7

K,

Your Honor, I think—

a

(1

So as to alert the Court to the area.

K

Yes. I think, Your Honor, in this case the defendant

'10

did suggest, both in his affadavifc, in the motion and also

11

in those proposed findings of fact, which you asked about,

32

the kind of television and newspaper coverage and to answer

13

finally and specifically that question about the proposed

!4

finding of fact that appear, I think it's record 23, they

16

18
19
20
21

22
23
24

23

were rejected in the record at page 9, as the hearing

on the

motion for a change of venue, and the court r£jucted those
findings of fact on the same grounds that it rejedctd the
proffer

of proof, saying, page 9, that change of venue was

asked for in the motion, and will be denied, it not being
provided for in the Wisconsin Statutes. Also filed with the
court is the findings of facts and conclusion of law. I'll
leave that unsigned.
Ql

Let me clear up one thing. In the last page of your

appendix is a Motice of Appeal that this court filed in the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin. Now, that has a bearing on the

45
