ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES J. MC CARTHY, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF ALABAMA POWER COMPANY, ET AL.

8

MR. MC CARTHY:

9

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the issue in this case is the renewability of an

10

order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which authorises

11

the nation's railroads to raise their freight rates an average

12

of five percent or nearly a half billion dollars a year.
I think it's important to have in mind just how this

53
14
15
16
17

25

case arose.

The usual procedure followed by a railroad when it

wishes to change a rate is to file the new rate with the Commission 40 days before its effective date.

During that 30-day

period the rate is subject to contest and to suspension and in­
vestigati on.
If the Commission determines not to suspend or in­
vestigate the rate goes into effect; the Commission's action is
discretionary, not reviewable and one who wishes to complain of
the rates must file a formal complaint.
On the other hand if the Commission decides to in­
vestigate the final order in the investigation proceedings is
subject to judicial review.
3

In a general increase case the procedures that must

i

2

be followed are a little different»

3

for this; outstanding orders of the Interstate Commerce Commis­

4

sion which prescribe rates, those rates can't be changed without

5

Commission authorisation.

6

situations arise in which there is a lesser rate for a longer

1

distance than applying for a shorter distance included within

8

the longer.

9
10

11
12

There are three reasons

Then in every general increase

And that, of course, is a violation of Section 4

of the Act unless the Commission authorizes it.
Finally, there is a mechanical problem.

It’s just

not feasible to file increase in all the myriad railroad rates
and the preferred procedure is to file a master tariff which

13

includes all the increases and what are known as connecting

%A

link supplements.

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

These are supplements in each individual

tariff which simply say that all of the rates in this, .tariff
are subject to the increases in the master tariff.
The Commissioni tariff filing rules don't permit
that, so in order to follow that procedure it’s necessary to get
authority to depart from those rules.

The proceeding of which

we seek review was initiated by the railroads by filing a
petition asking for all three of these forms of relief.

The

Commission immediately granted the tariff filing authority
request and it modified outstanding orders and granted fourth
section relief only to the extent necessary to permit the tariffs;
to be filed.

4

1

At this point the situation is similar to what it

2

would have been had no such authority been required.

3

are filed? they are subject to protest; they are subject to

4

investigation and suspension.

S

There is one major difference, though.

The rates

That is that

6

the Commission could not at this point simply say,

7

investigate and let the rates go into effect," because the

8

railroads have an obligation to get a modification of outstand­

"We won’t

ing orders and fourth section relief before they can legally put
these rates into effect and that’s recognized by the railroads
In their petition they add that the rates be authorized onlyafter hearings and that after a finding that the general level
will not be more than is just and reasonable.
The rates 'were protested? the Commission did suspend
and the Commission did initiate an investigation.

At the same

time it authorized the railroads to put into effect a threepercent increase subject to investigation.

That three-percent

increase isn't involved here? I mention it just in the interest

continued .

In other words, this is the last step in the general

increase case.
The plaintiffs in Number 106 are shippers or associa­
tions of shippers who pay more than 20 percent of the Nation's
freight bills and the action was filed as a class action in
behalf of all shippers.
In every general increase case, and I don't care
whether it’s a railroad or what kind of utility it is, there are
two basic questions; one, what increase, if any, should be
authorized; how much more money should be provided by an in­
crease in rates.
And the second question is; how are we going to
6

!

spread that increase out over the various services that this

2 |

utility performs?

3 j

Our complaint goes to the first issue,

We say that

4

the Commission ciidnot apply a rate-making standard in the Inter­

5

state Commerce Act and that if it had applied it could not have

6

authorized this increase on the present, record.

7

We also say that the Commission should have looked at

Q

the needs of the railroads in each of the main regions of the

Q

country, rather than just a general overall increase.

Then we

io

say that the Commission should have looked at types of traffic

n

by broad categories.

12
13
14
IS
10
17
18

We do not say that the increase makes any specific
rate unreasonable.

The controlling principle as we see it, is

that there is a presumption in favor of the reviewability of an
agency order.

This Court has repeatedly said that an order will

not be held to be nonreviewable unless there is persuasive
reason to believe that Congress so intended.
The railroads point to nothing even remotely sugges­
tive that Congress intended to accept general increase orders

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

from the broad statutory authorisation that it has given the
review orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and to reviewfreight orders generally in the Administrative Procedure Act.
The railroads basically make two arguments: they say
we haven31 exhausted cur administrative remedies —
Q

May I ask you a question?
7

*

A

Surely.

2

Q

Is this general revenue proceeding a creature

3

of statute or a creature of the Commission?
A

4

It’s a creature of the Commission.

The Act

S

provides two sections under which proceedings can be instituted.

6

If a rate has not gone into effect the investigation is under

7

15(7); if it has then the shipper has to file a complaint under

Section 13.

This is just a Section 15(7) proceeding but it is

Q

My point is that this being an administrative

creature# it is not very significant# is it# whether or not the
statute has any review proceeding in it?
A

Well, Your Honor, this is a proceeding which

follows the Interstate Commerce Act.
ceeding under the authority

The Commission is pro­

granted by Section 15(7) of the Act.

So the particular way that the Commission proceeds in this case
is a matter of administrative decision, perhaps; that the
authority to proceed and the basic procedure is all pursuant to
Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act.
Q

Then you have specific review provisions in

those sections.
A

There is a specific review provision, Section

1336 of Title 28 which says that all orders of the Interstate
8

Commerce Commission ars subject to review in the courts„
If the Court please, I think that the general level
of freights as being a horizontal line and the'individual rates
are dots.

Some of them are above that line and some of them are

below and the average height of all those dots is the same
height as that horizontal line.
Now, suppose we raise that line 5 percent.

If all

of -the rates are raised proportionately the relationship of each
rate to that new line is the same as its relationship to the old
line was.
The railroads says "We need to go back to the
Commission before we can have review of the order raising that
horizontal line, and file complaints on the million or so rates
in which we are interested.

What would the issue be in such a

proceedings?
When' the lawfulness of an individual rate is chal­
lenged the question iss how is it related to the general level
of reasonableness.

It doesn’t involvethe question of 'where the

general level of reasonableness is.
Now, we are not challenging the relationship of
individual rates to that general level, so if we followed 'the
railroads’ suggestion and went back to the Commission with
these thousands or millions of cases we would have to say to the
Commissions
these

we do not challenge the relationship of any of

rates to the new level that you have set.
S

All we want to

challenge is what, that — whafc is that level which yon have just

set in 'the proceeding that has just been terminated.

They certainly have a tremendous practical

It's more important to a shipper to have his rates

terests are affected to a minor degree and Can't have court
review if his interests are affected to a major degree?
Now, that brings me to the policy question.

The

railroads argue that this court should deny relief because some
District Court, might improvidently grant interlocutory relief
to a shipper to the railroads' detriment.
In my experience I think that danger is greatly
exaggerated but I suppose it is possible that a District Court
might act improvidenfcly, but there are two answers to that.

In

the first place, if the safeguards that attach to interlocutory
relief are not sufficient in a general increase case, then the
thing to do is to shore up those safeguards? it's not to deny
judicial review.

review vastly outweigh any on the other side.
If an agency is insulated from judicial review there

is always the risk that their handling of cases of this kind

may become perfunctory.

This is where the review stops.

There

is no way that we can get review of what the Commission did in
this general increase proceeding unless we get it by direct
review.

If we go back to the Commission challenging — we have

to challenge every rate across the board because we are inter­
ested in every rate and we say to the Commission: "We're raising
no question about where this particular rate stands in relation to

Mr. O’Malley.

„

ESQ.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

The ATlantic City Electric Utility and State

Appellants appeal here from the order of a three-judge statutorycourt in the Southern District of New York which dismissed
Appellants’ complaint seeking permanent injunctive relief from
tlie same general revenue order of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission which has been so clearly described here by Mr.
McCarthy and —
Q

I apologise for .interrupting you right at the

threshold of your argument, but you come from a different court
dismissal of your petition.
A

Yes. Your Honor.

Q

.And tills suggests that if your view is correct,
12

1

then every single district court in the Nation could be asked

2

by a shipper to review this Commission determination.

3

correct?

Is that

4

A

I would say that every District Court in the

5

Nation could deliver ~

6

Q

In every Federal District in the country.

7

A

However, as I believe we suggested in our

3

brief, the reply brief and as the Government has in its, there

9

are various judicial remedies, needless to mention to this

10

court, of transfer of venue and stays to decide bellwether

11

cases and there is always the possiblity, conceivably of a

12

special master being appointed collectively, it seems to us, by

13

a group of District Courts if there are a multiplicity of this

14

type of suits.

15

In tills particular case, Your Honor, we have a

1(3

somewhat different approach to the order from that of Mr.

17
18

McCarthy, and it would have been somewhat difficult, perhaps,
to combine the suits.
Q

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Well, I didn’t -»- I say, I apologise again

for interrupting you. right at the beginning, but that is one of
the matters, frankly, that I have questions about.

That is, I

don’t know many District Courts there ares 86, 100, whatever
it is and also as I understand it, there is no statute of limi­
tations .
A

This is true —

13

Q

2

I would hope that in due course in your

arguments you would —
A

3

We do believe, although since you say it is at

4

the threshold, it is a terribly important point and we do note

5

that there is the doctrine of laches we believe would be appli­

6

cable in this area, although there isn't a statute of limita­

1

tions .
But, the finality and judicial reviewability of the

Commission order, if I may resume my argument, sir, are also at
issue.

It's in both cases since both courts below held that the

general revenue proceeding of the Commission and the order was
not final and not re.view able.
We agree with Mr. McCarthy, these Atlantic City
Appellants which are, 1 should footnote, four electric utilities
and ten state departments of agricultura, including the Attorney
General of New York representing the State of New York Depart­
ment o f Agriculture.

We agree with the United States and the

Commission and the Alabama Appellants that the lower courts were
wrong in dismissing the complaints.

We all agree that those

parts of the Commission order that dealt with findings of
general revenue needs of the railroads nationwide costs to the
railroads, and that the railroads required addifionalrevenu.es,
were final determinations andripe for judicial review.

23

The position of these appellants 1 represent differs
24

on the reviewability point from that, of the Alabama Appellants
25

14

1

somewhat but not very much.

9

The United States Commission takes the position

3

that the order appealed from was final only in the aspect of

4

revenue and findings of cost.

5

should be reviewable in its entirety and that it is totally

8

ripe for judicial review under the principles of the City of

7

Chicago, Data Processing and Barlow v, Collins cases recently

8

committed to this Court, under the provisions of this Court and

9

under the general provisions of the Administrative Procedure

10

It is our position that the order

Act.

11

The railroads differ from all other parties by seek­

12

ing affirmance of the orders herein on the grounds that no part

13

of the Commission order can be reviewed and if is not final and

14

not right for review but that it’s not reviewable, as well.

2!
22
23
24
25

Turning now to our argument that the scope of judicia I
review should encompass the entire order, Your Honors, I believe
it might be helpful, although it might sound as though I am
repeating some of the things that Mr. McCarthy said, to touch
briefly on the general revenue proceeding itself as an illustra­
tion of, and foundation for our contention that the other parts
of the order were as final as the parts of the order which were
alluded to by Mr,. McCarthy and are accepted, by the Government,
as reviewable.
After the railroads filed the master tariff which
increased the rates on virtually all commodities in the country

15

I

by varying percentages from 3 to 10 percent, the Commission

2

after suspending the tariff, as Mr. McCarthy has said, entered

3

upon an investigation into proposed increases, commodity by

4

commodity.
The railroads consistently refused to

5

produce any

6

evidence related to the costs of transporting bituminous steam

7

coal or grain, for example, in the commodity hearings related

8

to those commodities? the subhearings.

9

held on appeal to the'Commission, within file framework of the

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

;

Those refusals were up­

hearing.
The railroads also failed to introduce any evidence
that the proposed increases would not. drive coal, grand and
other commodities from the rails.

It was on this kind of

sparse and deficient record that the Commission concluded first
that the percentage increases in coal and grain and in all other
commodities that they finally found would not "exceed
maximum reasonable levels.“
And second, that those increases would not have a
diversionary effect on the movement of traffic bythe rails.
With respect to the latter finding the Commission said in its
final order and this is in the Appendix at page 393-A: "The
increased freight rates and charges authorised herein will have
no undue adverse on the movement of traffic by railway."

It is

the position of these Appellants that such findings which Qon~
stitute a statutory refinement for the Commission permitting
16

1

the increased rates to become effective had just as much

2

finality and required judicial review fully as much as do its

3

finding on railroad costs and revenues.

4

Now, if Your Honors please, there is another aspect

3

of this case at this revenue proceeding that it seems to us

3

should be equally reviewable and it relates to the Commission,

7

departures from what we regard as proper procedures in conductin';

8

the general revenue proceedings resulting in these final deter­

9

minations at the termination of idle proceedings.

10

We regard them as essential to its findings on cost

n

revenues and across-the-board commodity percentage increases.

12

For example? there is admittedly no participation in a hearing

1.3

by the Commission personnel in the face of the kind of record

14

that had to be presented in a general revenue proceeding, frag­

15

mented evidence by many of our shippers and the railroads’
failure to present anything but the most general statistical
evidence on overall costs and revenue needs on a country-wide
basis, with no cost evidence on a commodity-by-commodity basis
and no substantial evidence, we submit, on the possible effects
of diversion.

It appears to us that there was a deficient

record requiring the Commission, by counsel and its staff, under
Scenic Hudson Doctrine decided, as you will recall, in the
Second Circuit, 354 F. 2d and as to which this Court denied
certiorari at 384 U.S.
Under the Scenic Hudson Doctrine we submit that the

17

t

Commission had a duty as an agency and obligation to

2

and produce a complete record in all these aspects in which the

3

record was deficient and we believe that the order of fe he Com­

4

mission should also be revlewable from that light.

3

develop

Now, the railroads require shippers, in order to

,

6

obtain reviewability of this order of the Commission

7

litigate before the Commission in proceedings under Section 13

S

and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act, all these issues that,

in our view, and we submit, as it seems apparent from the record

10

and the nature of the order, were final decisions in the general

11

revenue proceeding.

12

to re­

The Government would require by its position that

13

Commission procedures and findings as to the diversion of

T4

traffic and the reasonableness of commodity rates, if I under­

15

stand Idle Government's position correctly, and I am sure Mr.

16

Springer will correct me later if I am wrong, would have to be

17
18

IS
20
21

22
23
24
25

relitigated in such proceedings.
Now, we respectfully submit, as I believe Mr.
McCarthy has already advised the Court, that neither Section
13 or 15 contemplates the review of determinations of such
broad sections as are considered in the general revenue proceed­
ing which the Commission has set up to deal with the special
economic problems of the railroads on a nationwide basis.

Those

sections are designed to review a particular rate of a particular
shipper for particular traffics in some particular localities.
18

1

The Commission is, after hearings on these matters as to

2

specific rates then has the power to make reparation or adjust­

3

ment.

4
3

6

They are not designed to consider the question of the

kind that the railroad would have referred to them or the Govern­
ment would have referred to them.
And we note that the Commission itself, in 1958, X

7

believe, decided a specific case, the Hoppers Coal case at

8

303 I.C.C. where it refused to review the general findings of

9

a Section 13 proceeding brought by a coal shipper and we believe

10

that decision is correct within the proper statutory scheme and

11

the Government is in agreement with us on this point.

12

Now, these — if Your Honors could contemplate a

13

situation where all the issues in the general revenue proceeding

14

were to be relitigated in Section 13 or Section 15 proceeding

15

if the statute permitted it, the evidence to be presented by the

16

shippers would have to be the same as was presented in the

17

earlier cases and rejected by the Commission in its order in the

18

general revenue proceedings on these broad issues and with the

19

same evidence presented can it be reasonably contemplated that

20

the Commission would then conclude that it had previously com­

21
22
23
24
25

mitted error.
We respectfully submit that we think not.
Q

May I ask you when these proceedings were

brought the first time?
A

Mr, Justice, the hearings of the Interstate

2

Q

Is that when it was filed?

3

A

If was filed in 1968, Your Honor, and in March

4

of 1968 and the first of the two final orders that made the

3

total final order, was issued in November of *68 and the second

6

in January of 569, the final order of two parts.

7
8

Q

Do all parties agree that it is a final.

A

No, Your Honor? I believe that the railroad

order?

9
10

takes the position that it is not a final order and seek affir­

11

mance of the courts below to that effect and the Government, the

12

Commission and the Department of Justice of the United States,

13

take the position that part of the order is not final.
It is our position, Your Honor, that all of the

14

order was final.

And what would be the issues there?

12

The issues in that proceeding would be those

unreasonable, discriminatory, preferential.

Your Honor, but beyond the provision except that it does require.
I believe, that they consider diversionary effects with respect
to those particular rates.

Yes.

3

would like to return to Mr. Justice White's question just

4

before the recess which I don't believe I had explored suf­

5

ficiently for his purposes and as 1 understood the question is

6

whether if the carriers had filed specific rates on our traffics:

7

coal and grain traffics, could we obtain review.

8

if that had happened, one of two things would have taken place:

9

either the Commission could have suspended and investigated

And, of course,

10

those rates in the same way as it did here, a general investiga-

1!

tion and then decided the case and if it decided adversely we

12

believe that there would be no question that the order would

13

have been reviewable by a three-judge court such as we feel the

14

order here should be reviewable by a three-judge court under the

16
17
13

20
2?

22
23
24
25

Administrative Procedure Act in the City of Chicago.
In fact, all we're asking for here is exactly the
same review, Your Honors, to which we would have been entitled
in the situation which Mr. Justice White hypothesized.
Q

Yes, but what would be the issues if they had

filed specific tariffs and either one of the alternative things
would have happened, what would have been the issues?
A

The issues would have been the justness and

reasonableness of the rates and the factors that would have been
opened would have been to the extent of those particular rates,
the diversionary effects of the increases on those particular

23

1

traffics which would not have taken into account the total

2

diversionary effects which we feel have been decided in this

3

case-on a nationwide basis.

4

Q

What else?

5

A

And to the extent it was possible in this

3

miniscule section .of the total revenue picture of the railroads

7

to determine the revenue needs related to those particular

8

tariffs perhaps, but not the broad based kind of hearing that

9

we had before in this case where all the nationwide commodities

10

and statistics are involved and the Commission has authorized a

11

raise in rates across the country which affects every tariff in

12

the country, based on the premises determined in the invejstiga-

13

fcion hearing they started here in Section 15(7) which, indeed,

14

is determinative of these issues to the point of authorizing the

15

railroads to raise their rates on all these commodities.

13

is where our point of review comes —

Q

There

Yes, but isn't your — aren't the interests

of your client really in the rates on their traffic?
A

Well, the interests of our clients are really

in getting a judicial review of the acts of the Commission in
making a determination that results in an increase across the
board in operations in our traffic and if that —
Q

Yes, but you are just interested in your own

We are interested in our own traffic ultimately
24

If Your Honor please, I believe the kind of

proceeding that would take place were this sent back for review
by the three-judge court, would review the issues in the big
proceeding that impinged on the traffic we were concerned with
and would, if any refunds or refunds related to our traffics,
not the entire order, I would assume that the court would limit
the impact of its findings to the situationof the complaints„
That would be ray interpretation of what would happen.
Q

Then it isn’t the broad tax that we heard

discussed this morning, really? is it?
25

A

1

Yes, Your Honor, because, Mr. Chief Justice

2

the only reason these rates had been raised and the reason we

3

asked your review of this investigation of the Commission is to

4

determine that these rates could be raised by this much but on

5

the basis of the record which we claim .is deficient* -improperly

there were proper consider'at ions as the statute requires in

I think that would be difficult to do except to

say that .our clients perhaps are involved in something of the

20

the

21

total that were authorized by the Commission.

But, this is

a very difficult figure to arrive at with any precision, Mr.
Justice.
If I may I would like to conclude my argument and
leave two of the minutes that are left to Mr. McCarthy who has
reserved them for rebuttal, simply asking that we urge the Court

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES van R. SPRINGER, ON

3

BEHALF OF APPELLEE f THE UNITED STATES

6

MR. SPRINGERs

I’m here on behalf of three distinct

7

Federal Government parties; first the United States, which was a

8

statutory defendant in the District Court, as it is in most

9

ICC review proceedings; second the Commission itself, whose

10

order is in question and third; the Secretary of Agriculture,

ti

who has an independent statutory responsibility in ICC pro­

12

ceedings involving farm products.

13
14

13
16
17
18

19
20

21
22
23
24
25

The Secretary was a party in the Commission proceed­
ings below and he intervened as a plaintiff in the District
Court proceedings in the District of Columbia case; that is the
iAlabama Power case, though he did not become a party, that is
the Secretary, in the Atlantic Electric case which was sub­
sequently begun in New York.
Because of their different responsibilities these
■three Federal parties have taken different positions on the
merits of the ICC order.

The Secretary of Agriculture generally

sides with the plaintiffs in the Alabama Power case; the
Commission, of course, defends its order on the merits and the
United States, though a statutory party concluded that it could
leither support nor oppose the Commission's order in the District
27

I

Court proceedings.

2

merits and so we submit they are not in issue here since the

3

courts below both dismissed the complaints before them on the

4

grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to

5

relief; that is a claim for judicial review.

But the courts below did not reach the

state a claim for

So, the only question here is whether the — the

6

7

threshold question, whether the Commission's order was review-

3

able, is reviewable, and if so, towhat extent.

9

Q

What is your position?

10

A

As to

that I was just going to say, Mr.

11

Justice, the — my three clients are substantially in agreement

12

on that, which is why I think I can appropriately speak for all

13

of them.

14

of Columbia District Court does state a claim for judicial re­

15

16

We believe that the Alabama Power case in the District

view and so we agree, I think, completely with Mr. McCarthy's
clients in that case.

17

In the Atlantic Electric case there is to be sure, a

18

relatively minor disagreement between the United States and the

IS

Commission, which are the only two Federal parties in that case?

20

but in terms of the relief we suggest, a remand of that case,

2!

this difference becomes of relatively little importance.

22
23
24
25

Both

the United States and the Commission do, however, disagree
significantly with the plaintiffs in the Atlantic City Electric
case, as I shall elaborate in a minute.
I think it's fair to say that the only disagreement
28

1

among any of the parties, including the railroads on this

z

reviewability question# is the disagreement as to whether the

3

various aspects of the general revenue order have sufficient

4

pragmatic finality to make review appropriate now or whether#

5

on the other hand# review should be deferred

S

have exhausted further administrative remedies challenging

7

particular rates like complaints under Section 13 of the Act#

3

which the Commission would then consider under Section 15(1)

9

after the rates had gone into effecte
We think that it's clear from both the Court9s

10

11

decision last term and the City of Chicago case and more par­

12

ticularly on this issue from the decision several years ago in

13

Abbott. Laboratories against Gardner that this is the only

14

question*

15

proposition that review should be available at the earliest

16

stage at which the agency has made a final determination on a

17
???

until shippers

18

Abbott Laboratories# I think# established the

controversy as to the validity of that determination, has
ripened as to the existence of controversy*

I think there is

IS

no question here*

20

of the Commission's decision so the only question# I think#

21

22
23
24
25

The shippers are paying higher rates because

clearly is of finality which# as the Court again indicated in
Abbott Laboratories# is a pragmatic question based upon a care­
ful analysis of what the agency has actually done and what kind
of attack the parties seeking review are making upon what the
agency has done*
29

1

So

2

again,, though

3

that were before the Commission in the general revenue proceed­

4

ing and what the Commission did with those issues.

5

that 1 think I should proceed now to review once
perhaps in a somewhat different aspect, the issue

A general revenue proceeding is an investigation

S

under Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act which

7

generally permits the Commission to make a final determination

8

in advance of the effectivness of new rates as to whether those

9

rates are lawful or not.

10

Section 15(7) explicitly permits the Commission to

11

do in advance everything that it could do after the effective-

12

ness of new rates under 15

13

ceeding could

14

response to a complaint by a shipper under Section 13,

-- Section 15(1) and the 15(1) pro­

be either on the Commission's own motion or in

15

Both, therefore, both of these subsections contem­

16

plate that the Commission will make the same kind of inquiry.

17

That is, it will determine whether the rates are just and

18

reasonable and further, whether they are "unjustly discrimina­

19

tory" or unduly preferential or prejudicial.

0
21

22
23
24
25

And Section 15a(2) expands upon the just and reason
able standard so that that inquiry in substance, includes

two

questions: first, what are the.railroad's revenue needs if they
are to provide adequate and efficient service at the lowest
cost consistent with the furnishing of such service and under
honest, economical and efficient management.
30

And the second question under the just and reason­

1

2

able rubric, is what effect will an increase in whatever rates

3

are in question have upon the movement of traffic.

4

ticularly, will such an increase divert traffic from rail

5

carriers to such an extent as to defeat the purpose ofthe in­

6

crease .

1

More par­

Now, when all the railroads in the country want to,

8

as they did here and as they had previously and subsequently,

9

want to increase all of their freight rates to compensate for

10

increased costs, it8s obvious that the Commission cannot

'll

feasibly make all of these determinations with the seven months’

12

suspension period that is allowed it under Section 15(7) before

13

the new rates can be allowed to come into effect.

14
15

m
17
18

19

20

2?
22
23
24

25

And, of course, the railroads claim and the Commission
has to give effect to that claim that they have an urgent need
for an increase hwen this kind of situation comes up.
other hand, the‘ Commission frequently concludes that

On the
did here,

that it should not allow the railroads to increase'their rates
generally without some prior investigation,
In consequence, many years ago the Commission de­
veloped the general revenue

proceeding which is a limited kind

of Section 15(7) proceeding inwhich the Commission generally
examines the proposed across-the-board tariff increases but
expressly refrains from determining the lawfulness of each and
every rate that would be increased.

31

Q

1
2

In fact, it doesn't determine the just and

reasonableness of any particular rate?
A

3

That’s true,, Mr. Justice.

What it does —

is a question which we agree which has been thoroughly con­

sidered!, and thoroughly decided by the Commission .

How long is it after the Commission makes a

that a specific rate goes into effect?

12

In fact, the timetable of this prosesdifif

13

was dictated by the fact that the Commission suspended the rates

Q

At that point a shipper can attack a specific

rate before the Commission?
A

Yes, by instituting a new proceeding, which of

course, would take some time and it might be a year or two later
by the time judicial review could be had as to that»
Q

The Commission itself, as I understand it in th«

Koppers Company case, 303 Interstate Commerce Commission, has
taken the position that in a later proceeding attacking a speci.fi c

34

i

rate the general authorization of a rate increase is just not

2

at all relevant *
A

3

Am I mistaken about that?
That8s what the language in the opinion

4

I would not want — I don't think the Commission would

want me

S

to hang too much on the relatively brief language in that

6

opinion.
Q

They simply declined to consider it, didn't

Yes.

10

Q

Or to admit any evidence or argument about it

A

Yes.

1
&

11

they?
And as to the general —

and ~

12

And as to the general revenue findings

13

the only thing it could do in such a further proceeding would

14

be a kind of reconsideration of what it had already decided

15

fully.
*

Q

16

17

The Commission declined to give even that much

consideration, even pro forma reconsideration; am I mistaken?
A

18

Yes; it!s true in that case, but again I think

19

I do honestly have to say that that would not reflect a fully-

20

fleshed out and thought out Commission consideration of exactly

21

the kind of problem 'that we have here.
And of course, the Administrative Procedure Act says

22

23
24
25

the fact that reconsideration by the administrative agency is
available does not preclude judicial review before such recon­
sideration.

So that we agree that as to the general revenue
35

1

questions, which are essential underpinnings of the rate in­

2

crease,,

3

submissions that they needed more revenue this Commission would

4

not have allowed the increase.

5

If the Commission had disagreed with the railroads®

So that8s an essential condition to the increase,

6

one that the Commission can separately consider finally to the

7

extent if at all there are any further administrative proceeding s

8

possible as to that issue, they are only in the nature of re­

9

consideration and the availability of this reconsideration if

10

!t

there is such availability is not a part of judicial review.
This brings me then to the other issues, the issues

12

with which, at least in large part, the New York plaintiffs

In particular, it had to consider or Sections 15(1)

and (7) contemplate that it would consider whether the rates

20

would have adverse effects on the movement of traffic, that is

Here the question

is not what the railroads need

but what individual shippers in shipping various things in
various places are willing to pay rather than decide not to ship

36

1

by rail and what they can fairly be required to pay, consider­

2

ing the relationships among the various rates and other matters.

3

As I say, the Commission has given some considera™

4

tion to the matters in the general revenue proceeding and it

5

did throw out a relevantly small number c£ the particular rates

6

because of defects that became apparent to the Commission in its

7

kind of preliminary once-over on the detailed rate-by-rate or

12

sequent proceedings by complaints under Section 13 or should

13

result in Section 15(1) proceedings, to attack particular rates

14

of interest to them.

15

Specifically with reference to this Court’s decision

16

manyjears ago in the Arizona Grocery case, the Commission said

17

that we are not hereby prescribing all of the rates which are

18

in this kind of limited proceeding allowing the railroads to

19

increase generally.

20
21

22
23

So that we think -that the complaint in the Atlantic
City case is, in large measure, an attack on this second aspect
of the general revenue proceeding which the Commission’s kind
of once-over on particular rates.

And these are matters which

while the Commission had considered them, it had not considered

United States, the Secretary of Agriculture not being a party

II

As I indicated, there is a minor disagreement

The United States believes that the Atlantic City
complaints can be read perhaps as raising an attack on the

12

general revenue needs findings and perhaps also as raising an

13

attack upon the general nature of the kind of proceeding that

14

the Commission has had.

15

finally decided what kind of proceeding it's going to have and

16

I think that to the extent that shippers may want to raise the

17

question whether the Commission can have a general revenue

13

proceeding without finally determining all of the multitude of

13

rates involved, that, theoretically leads to the question that

20

is right for judicial review after the general revenue proceed­

But, the Commission and the United States do agree
that under all the circumstances as to the New York case it is
appropriate to remand that case so that the parties -- the
plaintiffs can amend their complaints if
38

they wish and the

District Court can shaps the litigation in accordance with its
general principles that we have suggested,

Q

Does that put you in sympathy with Judge

Wright8 s ei s sent?
A

Yes? completely in sympathy in the Alabama

Power case,-- which was the case he was focusing on.
Q

He also referred to the other

case, the

Atlantic case,
A

less he did.

A problem with the Atlantic City

case is that that District Court in New York seems to have
read the c omplainfc as having the generality -that we believe the
Alabama: Power complaint has and dismissing it on the same theory
that the majority of the district courts in the District of
Columbia dismissed the complaint there and I think they have
improperly read the complaint and also in terms of that judg­
ment — in terms of that reading, made an improper judgment.
There is the problem to which Mr. Justice Stewart
has adverted, of multiple district court proceedings in matters
of this kind.

Accordingly, we would suggest that in this case

the New York Court might well be instructed to stay its hand
until the District Court proceeding in -the District of Columbia
is completed.

That case was filed first? it involves, I think,

a larger number of shippers and it involves more clearly the
general issues which might, in practical terms, make the New

39

1

York case moot.

2

Q

Why do you say it should be stayed?

3

A

Just in the interest of orderly judicial

OPAL ARGUMENT BY HUGH 3, COX, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES ABERDEEN a ROCKFISH

5

RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL.

6

MR. COXs

7

Court;

I appear in this case for the railroads.
I think I should like to begin by commenting briefly

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

on some aspects of the statutory plans which ware touched upon

10

this morning, but which I think perhaps I should like to ask

11

the Court to remember while I give my version of what happened

12

in this case and what -the case is really about.
The point that I should like particularly to make

13
14

here is that when a carrier initiates a rate the only authority

15

that the Commission has to interfere with the timing of that

16

rate increase prior to a final determination that the particular

1?

rates involved are unlawful, is the power to suspend the rates

18

for seven months.

19

effective by operation of law not by virtue of any order of the

20

Commission*

21

main effective until the Commission has made a final determina»

22

tion that a particular rate involved in a rate change are un­

23

lawful*

24

25

At the end of that time the rates become

That's what Section 15(7) provides*

And they re­

This is the basic statutory plan that was involved
and discussed in the Arrow case and as the opinion there pointed

43

out, it was an accommodation between the interests of those who
thought that the railroads should not be able to change any
rate without prior approval of the Commission and the position
of the railroads who wanted to be able to change the rates with**
out any interference by the Commission, subsequent only to a
subsequent determination of their lawfulness».
And under this accommodation the railroads bear
irreparable the losses that are occasioned by a seven-month
suspension period.

If the rates are thereafter held to be law­

ful the railroads have no way of recovering that money.
On the other hand, the shippers, if the rates go into
effect, at the end of the seven-months period are protected by
their rights to recover reparations or by the normal refund
provisions that the Commission can attach under 15(7).
Now, with that preface I should like to state what
I think happened in this case and what the real pragmatic consequences, to take Mr. Springer's word of the Commission's orders
were: as has been said, the case started with a petition asking
for leave to file single master tariffs which the Commission
granted.

Now, no review has been sought with ’that order.
And, after they got permission the railroads' filed

tariffs, which I think was to become effective on the 24th of
June in '68.

They had to make it that far ahead because the

Commission, as a condition to giving -them permission, required
them to do so.
44
i

1

The first thing the Commission did was to suspend

2

that first master tariff for that entire seven months8 period

3

and at the same time, however, it said to the railroadss "Now,

4

if you want to file another tariff that makes only a three-

5

percent increase" — the increase in the master tariffs being

6

from 3 to 6

7

tariff that makes only a 3 percent increase we will not suspend

8

that tariff and the railroads did so and that 3 percent tariff

9

went into effect.

to the railroads, "if you wish to file another

10

At the time the Commission did this it said to the

11

railroads, in effect in its orders "Mow, we are investigating

12

this matter and we may decide later on that we should have sus­

13

pended these rates, even as to the 3 percent and if we decide

14

that we should have done that as to any or all of these rates,

15

then you are going to have to restore the situation to what it

13

would have been if we had suspended the rates, by making re­

17

funds ,"

18

The next thing that the Commission did was to issue

19

an order in November which has been called its "interim order,"

20

and in that order it decided, in effect, that it should not

21

have suspended any part of the rate increase and that it would

22

permit the entire rate increase to go into effect at the end of

23

November, at the same time again saying to the carriers ~ and

24

the way they did that again was to say,

25

You can file another

tariff which the railroads did fetich put the additional 3 percent
45

1
2

into effect.
At the same time it said to the railroads "We're
still looking at this andwhan we come to our final conclusion

4

if we decide that we should have suspended some or all of these

5

rates for the entire statutory period,jou are going to have to

6

restore the situation to what it would have been if there had

7

been such a suspension." And then at the end January it issued

8

a. final order in which it said some of these rates —- a few of

3
60

11

-- I’ think there were about nine instances, should have
been suspended? otherwise w® -think that our orders can stand.
So, 1 submit to the Court that the issue in this

12

case , my view of what happened is simply whether an, order of the

13

Commission which refuses to suspend a proposed rate increase

14

for the entire seven months9 period, but does not determine the

15

lawfulness of all or any of the rates involved, but leaves that

16

to bs determined in subsequent proceedings, is reviewable*

17

Because we believe that was the only consequence of

18

what this Commission did here.

19

we say that — the actual pragmatic effect of these orders does

20

not differ significantly from an order that the Commission enter;$

21

22
23
24
25

To put the matter another ways

in any ordinary suspension case in which it refuses to suspend
rates for all or any part or some part of its seven months9
suspension period.
How, we believe that an order of that kind that we
think the order is, should not be reviewable and our reasons
46

1

rest both upon analysis of the statute and upon certain prac­

2

tical considerations.

3

The Commission has been issuing these general

4

revenue orders for more than 50 years and in allowing the cases

S

that we have cited and discussed in our brief at pages 24 and

6

25 , the courts have held that these orders are not reviewable

7

and that the shipper has an adequate remedy by way of complaint

3

and reparation*

9

The courts have also held# which relates to what I

10

said a moment ago about the effect of this order and its rela­

n

tionship to a suspension proceedings# and -they have held# I

12

think# uniformly, that an order of the Commission that refuses

13

to suspend rates is not reviewable *

14

Mow,? both of these lines of cases — those cases? by

15

the way# are collected in the opinion in the Long Island case

16

in 193 Fed Sup, which is cited in our brief, at least the cases

17

up to 1961* since that time there have been a number of other

18

cases refusing to review orders that refused to suspend.

19

How# both of these cases — all of these groups of

20

cases s those that have refused to review the general revenue

21

orders and those that have refused to review the orders declin­

22
23
24
25

ing to suspend# if you examine the opinions? seem to me to rest
on two related considerations.
One rests on the structure of the act and particulari; f
on Section 15(7) because it seems clear and this was the purpose
47

of ray preliminary statement that under that section the
2

question of whether the Commission should interfere with the

3

timing of the proposed rate increase by suspending the rates is

4

not a matter that is appropriate for judicial review because it

5

is committed to the Commission’s discretion»
The Commission, when it refuses to suspend a rate, is

6
7

not required to make any kind -— not required by the statute to

8

have any hearing; it’s not required to give anybody any reasons

9

for its actions-.

The statute permits it to do that.

And long

20

ago in the Board against the Great Northern case which I think

11

is in 281 U.S.

12

is entrusted to the Commission only.

This Court said that the power of suspension

13

Now, we submit when you look at this — 1”ra going to

14

come to the practical considerations in a moment — but we will

15

look at this body authority and consider it as it existed at the

18

length of time it had* we submit that there is no reason to

17

depart from it in the case of these general revenue determina­

18

tions.

IS

They do not, and I will discuss this point in a moment,

also — they do not determine the lawfulness of any or all of

20

these rates that the railroads may increase as a result of the

21

order.

22

litigating any issues that are relevant in any Section 13 pro­

23
24
25

Now, as I think, they do not preclude the shipper from

ceeding »
These orders, and I want, to say a word about this —
now, 1 think it is clear that they do not determine the lawfulnes ;s

48

'I

of any of the rates and X *soa not sure that the Appellants

2

dispute that fact, but there isn't any room to dispute it be­

3

cause the Commission says right in its report'that it is not

4

determining that any of these rates axe reasonable rates; that

5

every one of them is subject to correction and that they are

e

in all respects, and 1 emphasise 85in all respects,5' and this is

7

the Commission's language, they are in all respects, subject to

Q

complaint and investigation.
And again, long ago this Court in the Brimstone

9
10

case in talking about orders of the very kind that are here in­

n

volved, said, "Those orders do not approve or fix any rates?

12

they do not determine that any rate is reasonable; they do not

13

approve in advance any rate that may be filed as a result of

!4

the order.”

13

Q

Mr. Cox.

16

A

Yes.

17

Q

I think,

if I understood you, you told us that

18

this body of authority, with respect to the nonreviewability

19

of a refusal to suspend here was based upon two foundations s

20

first 15{7) and 15 — what is the other?

21

22
23
24
25

A

Yes — the other idea is that the shipper has

an adequate remedy under the complaint proceeding to which he
should resort before seeking judicial review.

You will find

those two notions implicit in all —
Q

And it's a — over on the nonfinality, I
49

suppose or .something?

3

Yes.

I have difficulty, I must confess to the

Court, with the concept of finality.

concede that this order is final so far as it refuses to suspend

rates, but it isn*t final as to lawfulness.

things that you will find in those opinions and you will find

12

them both, in the opinions that relate to simple refusals to

But itss a combination of those

Mow, 1 would be prepared to

Q

15

???????

It’s always a question of

back 50

I notice that the general revenue orders go

years, you say?
A

Yes, ah — there seems to be an appearance of

18

ennui when I answer -this question because I have recently read

19

all of them — the first general revenue proceeding was really,

2Q

I think, in 1910 or 1911, just after the Mann-Elkins Act was

21

passed, but I would say that the form of proceeding that we have

22

before us today really began after the Transportation Act of

23

1920 and with the general rate increase of 1920.

24
25

The dealslens of the general rate proceedings before
the Kaiser war are, I think, in somewhat a different category.
50

!

But after 1920 this thing developed until it — and by early in

2

the thirties it had reached about the kind of form and substance

3

that it now has.

4
5
6

7

Q

It's really a procedure not explicitly content-

plated by the legislation? is it?
A

That's right? this is an administrative

mechanism which the Commission

8

Q

Based upon necessity.

9

A

Yes.

You might say# to paraphrase Sir Henry

10

Main, that "It has been secreted in the interstices of the pro­

11

cedure that is provided by Section 15(7)/’ but- it* s a little —

12

it's quite different kind of a development that rests on that

13

but is, in certain respects# different.

14

j

I may say, since you have raised this question that

15

the Commission itself, has# in its orders$ it didn't in these

16

orders# but in the other general revenue orders it is recognised

1?

that what I said about the similarity between this and the sus­

18

pension case. ■ In the 1920 general rate increase Commissioner

19

Eastman in his concurring opinion# said# "Essentially what we

20!

have here is a proceeding like a suspension proceeding.

21

22
23
24

25

There

is no finality about it? we are just deciding whether* we. should
allow these rates to go into effect.".
And in two later rate decisions# although I cannot
be certain about these# but I think it was the general rate in­
crease of 1958 and the general rate in 1960 that the Commission

51

1

made somewhat comparabis statements comparing this with what
goes on in an ordinary suspension case.

3
4

I think in one of the opinions they quoted Mr.
Eastmanes statement in one of -the 1920 cases.
How, from what I understand, to be the Appellants’

5

8

position, they do not deny that they have another remedy* but

7

they argue that the remedy is not adequate and so far as I can

3

understand I think that argument rests essentially on the inten­

9

tion that because of the Commission’s determinations in a

10

general revenue proceeding ? they would be precluded either by

11

something like the doctrine of res adjudicata or as a practical

12

matter, from relitigating these issues

13

complaint proceeding.

or relevant issues in a

Now, we submit that they are simply wrong about that

14

15

and that there is no want in authority or logic or in Commis­

16

sion precedent of practice for the view they take.

17

should say this in candor about these general revenue determina­

18

tions that are made in the general revenue order.

19

of course, to all rates and to all carriers as a group and are

20

made on the basis of physical evidence but in a very general

2!

way.

I think I

They relate,

Now, the determinations tthat the Commission makes
on that kind of evidence in that kind of proceeding may have
only a limited relevance in a proceedings relating to a parti­
cular rate but, while the Commission in those proceedings, does

52

1

often give consideration to the revenue needs of the carriers;

2

sometimes in general terms? sometimes simply in terms of the

3

revenue needs as related to a particular traffic involved.

4

But of course, these revenue needs in a particular

3

rate proceeding are only one of several factors,

The Commission

6

has often told the railroads -that they can't justify a rate

7

particularly just because they need money? they have to justify

S

that there, is reasonableness on other grounds and that they can

9

look at comparisons to comparable rates with the nature of the

10

commodity? with the costs involved

to what degree there is com­

11

petition? by other modes of transportation? the suggestion, that

12

they in these particular rates cases, that the Commission

13

doesn’t examine -the problem of diversion, is, I think, mistaken.

14

They look at all these things,

15

Now, the extent that the — any issue that is deter-

16

rained on whether revenue needs or anything else, is relevant in

17

a particular rate proceeding, complaint proceeding, we submit

18

that the Commission will look at it? the shipper is not preclude i

19

from raising it and litigating it and getting -- entitled to

20

have judicial review of any determination the Commission makes

21

about it.

22

Now, they have cited -— there has been some discus­

23

sion of the Koppers case in 303 ICC,

24

quite candid in indicating and I join with him, that no one

25

quite knows what that murky passage in the opinion means»

53

1 think Mr. Springer was

think I know what it means * but 1 can't be sure about it.

I

think all it meant was that the Commission wasn’t going to
litigate in that case-, whether it made a mistake in refusing to
suspend the rates»

means*

Q

You’re talking about the Koppers case?

A

The Koppers case? yes»

I think that's what it

There are other cases we have cited in our brief.

One

is the Globe Soap case where the railroads tried to justify a
rate on the grounds that it had been issued pursuant to ah
general revenue order and the Commission said, "Mo; you can't
do that; that's no justification whatever for this rate.
didn't approve this rate and we didn't fix this rate.

We

You've

got to justify it»ss
Mow, I think what, is more significant is that the
Commission has awarded reparation, found rates to be unjust and
unreasonable and awarded reparation with respect to rates that
were established pursuant to these general revenue orders,, and
when the railroads have tried to argue that those orders were
justification for the rates the Commission said,

they are

not a justification" and at least in one instance the courts
said that that was quite correct. That's the Cotton Florida Oil
Company case, I think, which is against the Southern Railway, I

So, as a practical matter, and 1 accept the pragmatic
test as a practical matter in these complaint proceedings , even

8

fact that the Commission did say and we know that taking its

9

report when it decided not to suspend these rates for the full

They have referred to the

10

period that it found that the generallevel of rates was unjust

11

and reasonable, a statement which immediately qualified by

12

saying, "We are only talking about the general basis for the

13

rates; we are not holding that any of the rates are lawful and

14

they are all subject to investigation and complaint in all

15

respects.”

16

But then the Appellants say that in a complaint pro­

17

ceeding they cart81 attack the generallevel of these rates, and

18

at that point, either because of some weakness of the flesh or

19

infirmity of the mind X cannot follow them because X assume,

20

perhaps in blindness, that what a shipper pays is the rate that

21

is applicable to his shipments and his commodities; he doesn’t

22

pay any general rate level and under the statute if he has a

23

remedy that will give him the just and reasonable rate which he

24
25

has in this case, -that that satisfies the statute.

If he gets

judicial in that proceeding, that that is an adequate remedy.
55

Now, I think if you look, and you can only do it.* I

1
2

think, by random sampling, you will see that when the Commission

3

determines the justness and reasonableness of a particular rate

this abstraction of the general rate level has not had any

weight in the deliberations»

cases on the basis of the facts precluding the revenue needs

7

'that 'the evidence before it relates to those rates and to the

8

extent, as far as I can tell from reading the reports of the

9

Commission, is that it relies on precedent? it relies only on

10

cases in which it has actually prescribed or determined that a

rate is lawful.
Q

12

Suppose they said that in this case here they

13

could get these rates set aside and then turn right around and

14

lose the case in which the railroads filed specific rates on

15

their commodities?
A

16
17

That's right? same rate and possibly a higher

rate.
Now, I said a moment agro that in discussing review­

18

10

ability I was going to come to the practical considerations that

20

we

2!
22
23
24
25

think support our analytical argument, based on the statutes
The first of those statute considerations has to do

with this matter of injunctive relief.

Now, I have to say that

in discussing these problems I find them very pussling and I
fear I am going to be more adept at raising them than I am at
answering them.

The troiible is that because, the general revenue

56

1

orders have never been reviewed and the orders refusing to

2

suspend rates have never been reviewed# .there eimply 'isn’t any

3

precedent and this is a very uncharted line of country.

just and reasonabless language is just inappropriate for the —

If you would like to look at a case where they used
that kind of language;, in a specific rate case, I think —

3

Q

Well, it bar anything in a subsequent decision.

4

A

No? no.

This bureaucratic language tends to

5

repeat itself and shift from place to place sometimes without

3

too consideration of whether it’s appropriate, but they use this

1

"just and reasonable" language even in an ordinary suspension.

8

Q

Can they do --

9

A

Well, they can do that? they don’t have to say

10

anything and they can do that.

11

the successful rate increases that followed this one, the one

12

in 1969, they let that go into effect at once.

13

investigate anything except questions of discrimination and pre­

14

ference? they wouldn't investigate reasonableness and they did

15

this in an order that's about a page and a half.

16

go through this elaborate discussion and make these findings and

17

have all these reasons.

18

As a matter of fact, in one of

And under the statute they can do that.

They have developed the practice over the years of

19

writing these elaborate dissertations in these general revenue

20

cases and this — and why 'they -used the language in the suspen­

21

22
23
24
25

sion cases, 1 could‘not attempt' to explain.
But, if I may go back to the problem of injunctive
relief, I think the Appellants have not'quite met the real
problem there which is a problem, X think, that suggests that
the kind of relief that they really want on judicial review,
58

1

ears.81 be obtained without doing violence to the statutory plan.

2

Now, what I mean by that is this: these general rate

3

proceedings frequently consume a large part of the statutory

4

seven months5 suspension period and people can’t — don’t go

5

into court until the Commission suspension»

6

goes into court and wants interlocutory relief, and it is

7

natural for them to do so because that’s one of the purposes of

judicial review»

9

problem of whether they can enjoin the rate increase beyond the

10

seven months3 period because in some cases by the time they get

11

to court seven months period will have expired or nearly expire.

21

law on that point is not yet clear and what -the railroads, with

22

reason, apprehend, is that first: they can8t be certain how the

The Government recognises this problem and it has

8

attempted to make some palliative suggestions which we have

9

discussed in our brief, but I think when you look at those

10

suggestions and consider all of them you can see that they are

11

not likely to really solve this problem»

12

problem is they cannot get relief beyond the seven months'

1.3

14
15
16

17
18

And'of course, if the

period, which is our position, then one of the principal purposes of judicial review, 1 suppose,' is gone at this point.
The judicial review of these orders would also
create some difficult problems about the refund provisions of
the Commissions general revenue orders.

Mow, we have discussed

that matter in our brief and I would like to refer the court to

19

that discussion and I would simply like to say this about it?

20

that that is a difficulty that arises because these refund

21

22
23
24
2.5

provisions in these general revenue orders are a little peculiar
Unlike the normal refund provisions in an ordinary section 15(7)
case they do not come into operation

their operation does not

depend, I should say, upon the final diatermination that particu­
lar rates are unlawful.

Their operation simply depends

60

1

upon a determination by the Commission that it made a mistake

2

in allowing the rates in becoming effective and not to suspend

3

the rates«

4

So that under these provisions the railroads could

S

and do, at times, have to refund the money that they collected

6

from rates that had never been determined to be unlawful and

7

which may thereafter be determined to be unlawful simply be­

8

cause the Commission has determined that the rates should have

9

bean suspended»

10

NOW

—

11

Q

May I

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

The refund comes

14
15

stop you a minute?

byorder of the Commission; is

that by rule or how does that come about?
A

Mr, Justice, I think that these refunds I’m

16

speaking of are refunds that the Commission attaches as condi­

17

tions to its refusal to suspend the rates»

13

Q

19

A

Thank

you.

And when the railroads take advantage of that

20

refusal, of course they have to accept, 'the conditions and they

21

©re bound by them.

22
23

24
25

Now, if these refunds — heretofore there has been
some uncertainty about these refunds but the railroads have at
least been certain that the time in which the liability would
accumulate 'would be limited to the time that the Commission

61

1

was required to consider the matter and while there was un­

2

certainty it was an uncertainty that arose from the uncertainty

3

about what one agency would do.

4

review of these orders, of course? the time within which this

5

uncertainty would continue and the length of time in which

3

this contingent liability would accumulate? would be extended.

7

And the uncertainties will be increased by the fact that there

8

you have two agencies instead of one whose views on these

9

matters may differ.

10

Now, if there is to foe. judicial

Now? that means that the railroads get. a general

11

rate increase if there is to foe judicial review or -they have a

12

very grave problem about, whether they can use this money -or

They can't very well plan or make definitive plans or use the

17

many of the railroads this is rather a serious problem.

IS

care of this contingent liability.

In the present cash position of

I have so far in this argument? talked about the

19

Commission's order simply in terras of what its consequences are

20

on the general level of rates or on rates generally.

23

22
23
24

25

I would

now like to say something about what. 1 think is a minor point?
really, about the provisions of the orders that grant relief
under the Fourth Section and from outstanding orders.
Those provisions of the order affect only a very
small number of the rates and they do not have much economic

62

i

significance.

2

conferences say that even without that relief they could gen­

O

O’*

erally achieve the economic results of a — of one of these

4

general revenue orders by excluding those rates and making them

5

the subject of separate proceedings.

6

1 am told that the rat® experts in the rate

But, for purposes of this afternoon I am going to

7

assume that orders that grant Fourth Section relief and relief

8

from outstanding orders, are in an appropriate case, reviewable.

9

But, my submission is 'that in this case it is not an appropriate

10

case to review the provisions of those provisions of the orders

n

that are here?, before the Court.

. The Appellants here.have not alleged that any of the
'
13 named appellants are affected in any degree by those provisions.
12

14

13
16
17
18
19

20

21
22
23
24
25

They have not argued that they are affected and when you look
at their arguments they aren't directed to Fourth Section
problems or to any problems that arise under outstanding rate
orders? they are directed to the general revenue determinations
of the Commission and the way it made them.
How, precisely a similar situation, in the AXgoma
case in 11 Fd. Supp. was the same kind of argument made and the
Court said, "Well, these shippers haven't shown they are affec­
ted; these provisions are simply incidental to. the main purpose
of the order and w© won't review them.

And we submit' that that

should be the conclusion here.
X am not going to say anythingabout the assertion
63

i

1

that some of these appellants represent all shippers of all

z

commodities in the United States, except to say that lest some

3

of these vague indications of who this enormous class may be

4

that are affected by the Fourth Sectionorders, I shouldn't

5

think that justifies judicial review.
And finally, if the Court should thinkthat it has to

6

F

7

look at that part of these orders then I suggest that the

8

review should extend only to those rates that are covered by the-.

9

Fourth Section provisions and the relief from outstanding

W

orders and not extend to the generality of rates of the general

11

revenue determinations that are here involved.
1 think that I should like to conclude by saying

12
13

something about the merits of this case.

We have asked this

U

Court if it, in the unhappy event that it should determine that

IS

these orders were reviewable, to consider the merits of the

16

orders and affirm them.

37

Mow, we knew when we made that request that this

18

Court has often said that it will not or it is reluctant to

19

consider agency orders or findings that have not been reviewed

20

by the lower court, but that, 1 assume, is not an ironclad rule

21

and this Court has sometimes departed from it and I am obliged

22

to say that -there are very urgent and powerful considerations

23

in the presexit situation that would suggest that it would be

24

appropriate for this Court to determine the validity of this

25

.

order.

64

For one thing

,

this contingent liability under the

,

1

refund provisions is accumulative

it accumulates possibly at

3

the rate of $400 million a year and if the railroads are going

4

tohave to give some or all of that back; it seems to me the

5

sooner they know about it the better.
But; apart from that it has been stated there have

6
7

been three rate increases since this rate increase that is here

3

involved and the showing

9

sion on those rate increases»- they of course are assuming the

that the railroads made to the Commis­

10

validity of this rate increase in income produced and presumably

11

in granting relief that the Commission itself assumed the same

12

thing.
Now, again if this rate increase is to be invalidated

13
14

in some way the railroads are going to have to give back any or

15

all of the large amoiant of money involved; the sooner the rail­

16

roads; and 1 suppose; the Commission; know that, the better so

17
18
19

20

21
22
23
24
25

that they can decide whether they have to take any steps in view
of that situation with r@speet to the revenue situation of the
railroads.
Wow» as far as the merits are concerned; we argue in
our brief and its reply that -the Appellants in the Alabama
Power made an argument on the merits; the Appellants in the
Atlantic City case have refused to argue in their briefs in this
Court; although

we tendered the issue to them; but they insisted

that they be included in the appendix; a memorandum that they
65

1

submitted to -the District Court below and that memorandum

2

contains their argument on the merits so held before the court,,
.

Mow, we have discussed this matter of the merits of

3
4

the Commission's order in detail in our briefs and I should

5

merely like to say this: that I think when you look at the

6

Appellants6 argument and consider the nature of the proceedings

7

that's her© involved, which is the proceeding, as I have said,

3

that was really essentially devoted to the question of whether

9

these rates should be suspended for the whole seven months 8

10
11

period.
But, 'those arguments do not provide any basis for

12

overturning the Commission’s judgment.

13

procedural arguments which really relate to how the Commission

14

manages its internal business, they are simply arguments that

15

attack the Commission's judgment on the evidence, on the weight

m

it gave to conflicting evidence? on the inferences and con­

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Apart from certain

clusions it draw from the evidence and on the wisdom of its
final determination not to suspend these rates for the entire
seven months' period.
Now, these arguments set forth in the reply of the
A. Jbama Power Appellants indicate that: -they say that the
Commission shouldn't have authorised it nationwide? it shouldn't
have used 1966 as & test year for the increase in expenses? and
other arguments of that kind? all matters about which reasonable
men may differ but they are also matters as to which the
S6

i

Commission has an area of judgment, and which its judgment, I

2

suppose, will bs respected unless it*s shown to be arbitrary

3

and capricious and I think that when you read the Commission's

4

report in this case, the interim report, and the final report,

3

it is apparent that the Commission considered all 'the evidence

3

and gave a reasoned statement for its conclusions.
And 1 think it is not impermissible for me to say at

7
8

this point that anyone who reads the facts that are set forth

9

in the Commission's reports inthe three succeeding general in­

10

crease cases that have come along since these orders were in-

11

volvad, anyone who looks at those reports and reads the facts

12

they will contain

13

the conclusion that whan the Commission decided in 1968 that the

14

railroads were in immediate and drastic need of increased rate

15

— that experience has shown that the Commission was not acting

16

arbitrarily and unreasonably when, on the basis of that con­

17

clusion it declined to defer or suspend this rate increase.
Q

18

that they contain, I think would foe led to

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT ALABAMA POWER

11

12

MR. MC CARTHY:

If fell© Court jsiaasSKs::

this effort to

13

equate suspension with the order in thise case is pretty far­

14

13

16
17

Suspension is something . — an order not to suspend

is an order which the Commission makes without any

the basis of a casual observation of the contentions of the
parties.
Here we have an order made after extensive hearings

record, on

and on the basis of detailed findings.

That's the distinction

between a suspension order and this type of order.

The sus­

pension order is discretionary and that's the reason it's not
reviewable.
Now, the mere fact that an order doesn't finally fix
the lawfulness of rates does not stop it from being reviewable.
In both interstate, in the Meehling case and the Waterways case,
69

1

the orders there involved did not finally fix the lawfulness of

2

rates.
