We will hear arguments

Mr. Livaudais.

This is a case also involving

Obscenity: is involving the criminal prosecution by Appellee
Ledesma in this case both for the sale of obscene publications
and the possession of obscene publications with the intent to
sell.
The primary issue in this appeal, raised on appeal,
is a procedural question in enforcing the state statute,

ted.

22

the question as posed to the Court is whether or not in a
state criminal prosecution under a valid and constitutional
state statute which has been found constitutional by the
three-judge court, relative to sale and possession with intent
to sell obscene material and publications, it is necessary that
there be a judicial adversary hearing prior to the arrest and
prosecution of the defendant to determine in advance of his
arrest or prosecution whether or not the materials and publica­

23

tions involved are obscene under the terms of the state statute.
24

We will have other related issues which I will

25

1

cover in connection with this in reference to the jurisdiction

2

of this Court on appeal in light of 28 U.S.C. 1253 in the

3

Dunn case which has been discussed.

connected involving injunctions and declaratory judgments undei

.in a State proceedings and abuse of discretion

This case originated on January 27» 1969 when two

8
9

We also have had files

deputies of the St» Bernard

Parish Sheriff's office in the

State of Louisiana» purchased four obscene publications from
Ledesma at his store in the St. Bernard, Parish in Arssbi»
Louisiana.

These publications and the other publications I

will-refer to are all here With the record which I brought in
filing with this Court.
Ledesma was arrested and at the tineof his arrest
these deputies selected certain publications — the three-judge
court found it be the number 45» from his shelf» as evidence.
Four bills of information were filed against him by
me in the state court; two of them under the state statute
relative to sale and possession with intent to sell obscene
publications and two almost identical bills of information
under the Parish ordinance»

These two charges under the Parish

ordinance which $©re almost identical to the state ordinance
was subsequently nolle pressed or dropped by me.
In

his prosecution in the state court» Ledesma
3

1

was afforded an adversary judicial hearing, focusing on the

2

obscenity of these publications, and informed of a motion to

3

suppress the evidence and a motion to quash the indictment

4

which he filed in the state prosecutions.

5

Basiss one allegation that our statute was vague

6

and overbroad and the other was that the materials were not

7

obscene.

8

he had his hearing in^ate court and we tried this issue and

§

the state was denied the motion of Ledesma.

10

This was decided — within two weeks after his arrest

-■ -...

Wanting another bite of the apple, he then went to

n

Federal Court to ask the Federal Court for relief under the

12

civil rights statute, asking to declare both our state statute

13

and our parish ordinance unconstitutional for vagueness and

14

overbreadth, and also asking for injunctions against pending

15

and future state prosecutions and also asking that we be en­

16

joined from retaining the publications in our possession and

17

using them in the prosecution.

18

19
20

Also he askedfor damages in the sum of $30,000 each
for his clients.
After a long and prolonged hearing in court — not

2!

in court, but a proceeding in the District Court after the

22

three-judge court was convened, on July 14 of 1969, some five

23

tosix months after the arrest, the three-judge court, in a

U

two-to-one decision, with Judge

25

of all, that our state statute, the two provisions? subsections

4

Rubin dissenting, held, first

1

2 and 3 involved here and weren't held to be constitutionale

2

Judge Rubin concurred in that.

3

The Court in its order, stated, and I say they

4

allege, that they denie;d to grant the injunctive relief»

5

a matter of fact, they say, "We specifically deny injunctive

6

relief."

7

8

Q

As

They didn't deny that they granted injunctive

relief in this case?
A

9

Your Honor, 1611 get to that, but my opinion,

10

and I think this Court will see that we were enjoined, both

11

pending and. future prosecutions were enjoined in this case,

12

that the Court, worded its judgment in this way so as to get

13

around the provisions of Article 2283 and this Court in other

14

cases which 1 will give to the Court shortly, look through

15

this particular type of action by a court where tryino to evade

16

2283 and actually had an order which had practical effect, the

17

operating effect, of an injunction on —
Q

18
19

There was a suggestion that you can't appeal

here; can you?
A

20

That's correct. Your Honor.

That unless juris­

21

diction in this matter was deferred to hearing on the merits

22

today.

Q

You have to construe what the judge said and

A

Yes, Your Honor.

perhaps —

t

the result as meaning: you must stop doing

2

this; if you don't* something will happen to you.

3

right?
A

4
5

That's right; that is the way I construe the

judgment of the Court.
Q

6

Isn't that

In the record —

Is that not —■ I don't know about Louisiana —

1

but is that not

8

to say, in effect* that they will not enter a formal order or

9

injunction on the assumption that the parties will abide or

10

suggestion -that they are not going to proceed with the'pro­

11

hibited acts?
A

12

a fairly familiar technique of District Courts

That is a common practice* Your Honor* and one

13

that I do not think is advisable for a District Court to take.

14

I think that Article 65* Subsection C of the Federal Rules of

15

Civil Procedure is a mandate to the Federal District Courts*

16

especially the three-judge courts that when they are dealing

17

in the area of injunctions* as was stated in the footnotes in

18

one case by this Court* that they should be specific; that it

19

is* in effect* unfair for them to deal with areas wuch as this

20

and not deal with them in a clear manner so that their inten­

21

tion is obvious to the parties.

That was the problem in the

Did you trust the court to conform the record

to the reality* the reality that you say is —
A

Yes, Your Honor.
6

First of all* I would like to

1

point out that in this easef as opposed to other cases 1 hav©

2

been arguing* we did not agree to stop our prosecution.

3

records show that* first of all* our case was set for trial

4

in February of 1969.

S

note of evidence with regard to the conference with Judge

6

Boyle in this case* shows that our ease was first -- again set

7

for trial on April 21st of 1969.

13

the District Judge* saying that the decision by the three-

14

judge court would be rendered in the near future and that we

would be able to take whatever action we had to after that.

So* we did not abide by any requests.

They ordered yau to return all of the materials

and not to use them at any future prosecution?

7

A

They ordered us to return all

of the materials instanta» instantly.

3

That's right.

Q

Is til at an injunction or an injunctive order

for purposes of Appellant jurisdiction?
A

5

I would say it is. Your Honor» in connection

6

with the wording in the judgment itself which said» and I

7

quote; "The pending prosecution should be effectively termina-

&

ted."

9

appendix to this record..

10

That was the wording of the judgment at page 97 in the

"The pending prosecution should be effectively

11

terminated."

12,

effectively terminated, it has the same meaning.

13

contention that wa were enjoined and that this order ordering

14

us to give up our evidence, to return it instanta and also to

15

suppress it in any prosecutions, both pending and future is,

16

has all the practical and full force operative effect of an

17

injunction upon us.

18

than to take our evidence away from us and to tell us that we

19

will not»- in good faith, continue the'prosecutions or to

20

that the prosecutions should be effectively terminated.

What better way to stop our prosecution

say

21

Now, Your Honor, there is a case and it's not in my

22

brief, I wish to cite to the Court at this time, in connection

23

with the Gun case, which came out after my brief was at the

24

IS

printer’s: International Longshoremen’s Association versus The
Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, found at 389 US -64.
8

1

In that case there was an order, an arbitration

2

award in a labor dispute and it was not before a court but

3

then, after a dispute arose over the arbitration order the

4

union went into court and they asked the court to give an ordez

5

and the court gave this order: "That the arbitration award be

6

specifically enforced?" and then he went on:

7

to comply with and abide with the award.”

9

"all the union

And on the appeal to this Court, even though the
word "injunction," was not used? Your Honors held, and I

10

quote:"Whether dr not the District Court * s order was an

11

injunction, it was an equitable decree compelling obedience

12

under the threat of contempt and was therefore an order grant­

13

ing an injunction

14

Q

Well, you don't have to, to have jurisdiction

15

here, you don't have to have an order enjoining a criminal

16

prosecution; all you would have to have is an injunction.

17

And if the Federal Court issues an order requiring you not to

18

use certain evidence

19

that an. injunction?

29

A

in a pending Federal prosecution, isn't

Yes, sir.

As a matter of fact, to look at

21

Ledesma's petition, both his original petition and his amended

22

petition, his prayer asks for injunctive relief to keep us from

23

retaining the books in our possession.

24

and that is what he got, the injunction that he asked for.

25

Q

That was his request

Did they mean to physically return all
9

of this

1

2

seised property; did they?
A

Yes, Your Honor, they did; it was instanta»

3

The only way I could stop thatorder was to get a stay order

4

pending the appeal to this Court and that is one of the reasons

5

why the books are here before this Court at this time.

transmitted the books here.

I

They had been introduced into

NoWt Your Honor, in light . of the Dunn case in which
actually the word "injunction” was used and this Court held

10

that it was not an injunction; and this other one in a

11

shoreman8s case, where the word "injunction" was not used but

12

this Court looked through the attempts of the Court to evade

13

the issue of 2283 and actually issue an injunction even -chough

14

2283 says it cannot —

15

Q

16
17
18

19

Long™

Well, in that case I think the Court held that

it was an order granting an injunction?
A

Yes; and that's what we had the right of

appeal for ~
Q

And it further we fit on to hold that it did not

20

comply with the Federal Rules; -that it was so ambiguous and un­

21

clear an order that they couldn't expect anybody to obey it;

22

wasn't that the holding in that case?

23

A

That's right; the holding in that case, but

24

Q

What is —

23

A

Just the converse is true in our case.

10

It is

crystal clear from the decision who is enjoined? teres,

Wendling, Bethea and Reichart are enjoined.

The prosecution pending and future under Title XIV, 106,

Sections 2 and 3.

5

and the prior pages in the opinion of the court.

6

enjoined,, these pending and future prosecutions and arrest.

What is enjoined?

This is all right in the opinion, page 97
What was

7

So, I think that this complies with Rule 65C and the

8

only abuse or discretion outlined here by the three-judge court

8

was deliberately making it look like they were not enjoining

10

11

m

us.
Q

You agree that what you had to look at

ultimately is not their opinion, but the order?

13

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Which is under Section 107.

15

A

16

Yes.

And the operative effect of the order

read in light with their opinion.

17

Q

Right.

18

A

And also' in the — another case in which this

19

was the same type of actions Atlantic Coastline case, which

20

also was decided in June of this year, Your Honors also looked

21

at the order in that case.

22

to take advantage of the State Court prosecution and Your

23

Honors in that, used the word "evade."

24

District Three-Judge Court cannot evade the mandate of 283 by

Q

You are just arguing jurisdiction?

Because jurisdiction was deferred by Your

How, the sole reason, again looking at the decision

11

of -the court, the sole reason for -the entire decision of this

12

Court can be seen both in the judgment and the footnotes,

13

Appendix 96 and 97, was that this Court h^ld that there must be

14

a prior judicial adversary hearing in this case.

'15

solo reason for doing what they did and they so stated.

IS

is a concept that they derived from the Marcus case and the

17

Quantity of Books cases which are referred to in my brief.

18

That is the

He did

The only thing new being requested is that this be
a prior hearing? that this adversary hearing be held before any
12

1

arrest or any prosecution of the defendant.

2

Your Honor,that this Court has never held that in a criminal

3

prosecution that this is necessary.

4

have indicated your preference for the conventional course of

5

criminal procedure, again enforcing these cases.

6

that other methods cannot be used, but I think that in these

7

decisions — for instance in the Kingsley Books case there in

8

New York, attempted to supplement the conventional course of

9

criminal procedure in dealing with these cases.

10

And I submit,

As a matter of fact, you

Hot to say

The problem with the Court at that time was that you

11

were hesitant, to allow 'them to supplement their procedures.

12

And throughout the cases: Roth, the Alberts case, which I

13

quoted in my brief there, Your HOnors indicated that such a

14

hearing was not necessary, by its light.

15

In the New York Feed case and the Milky Way cases

16

which were decided in February of 1970 by Your Honors, you

17

summarily affirmed the decision of the three-judge court which

18

held affirmatively that this- adversay judicial determination

19

of obscenity was indeed, a novelty, was unnecessary and afforded

20

no special.,protection 'to the books, talcing cognisance of the

21

concurring opinion of Chief Justice Warren in the Roth case,

22

that in these cases involving' criminal prosecution it is the

23

person who is on trial; not the books.

24
25

That decision was summarily affirmed by this Court
and as seen in the record, page 121 in the appendix, after
13

1

Your Honors came out with your summary affirmation of the Mew

2

York Feed and Milky Way cases, I went back to our three-judge

3

panel and I. told them, in my motion, which is in the record

4

here, that the Supreme Court has finally decided this issue as

S

to whether or not there must be a prior adversary hearing in

6

criminal prosecutions*

7

case; submitted memorandums and a motion was denied»
And I submit that this, number one, is proof of the

8
9

And I filed the motion? we argued the

injunctive intent of the lower court and also, Your Honor, 1

10

feel teat in this case they are asking you to take jurisdiction

11

and to decide these issues, because obviously, from the action

12

of the three-judge court in our ease the summary affirmation by

13

Your Honors is not enough to straighten out the morass that has

14

resulted in the Three-Judge District Court in this area.
And we must have a pronouncement from this Court as

15
16

to whether or not this type of hearing is necessary and that is

17

v/hafc we are asking you to do at this time.
We also feel, Your Honor, that we do have a question

18
19

in arguing the other cases before us of 2283, the Abstention

28

Doctrine, in view of Dombrowski, Cameron and the Atlantic

21

Coast cases.

22

with that that there is no finding of bad faith on our part in

23

this case.

And we just wish to point out strongly in line

There was a specific finding of good faith on our
v*Tv.

24

part and the Cameron case, read together with Dombrowski and

25

Atlantic Coast cases are specific that before these three-judge

14

1

courts can interpose fch erase Ives in t-ho place of the United

2

States Supreme Court in state prosecutions that there must be

3

bad faith psrosecsufei&n —— there must be a statute which is

4

found unconstitutional.
la our case the Court specifically found that the

5
6

sections of our statute that we8 re dealing with were constitu­

7

tional.

8
9

Now, the Court also abused its discretion in
ordering us to return the books and in not invoking the Doctrine

10

of JVbs&entxon and X argue this in connection with the Court’s

It

action in our parish ordinance unconstitutional.

12
13

With reference to our parish ordinance. Your Honor,
there is no case, there is no controversy of sufficient im­

14

mediacy and reality to warrant the action taken by the court.

15

In Golden v. Zwicker, which is a clarification of Zwickler v.

16

17
18

Kufcta, this Court held that although the Court might have
jurisdiction to hear declaratory judgment? what j ^.allegations
of the controversy in the absence in an actual controversy ©£

20

sufficient immediacy a'nd reality, the Court should not make
\
declaratory judgments in an advisory capacity only. The pur­

21

pose of this being, obviously, to keep the three-judge courts

22

from taking the prerogative of the United States Supreme Court

23

to issue these doctrines, especially in these cases of obscenity,

19

24
2S

whxch is so critical to our whole procedure in prosecuting
these cases in court.
15

\

1

One obvious result that we can see from the three™

2

judge court stepping into these cases is the facts as stated

3

in the previous case» "I Am Curious Yellow/' involving that*

4

that there are five other cases pending in Federal District

5

Three-Judge Courts involving these same issues»

6

contention that if these cases were allowed to go through the

7

normal course of the procedure as stated in the Atlantic Coast

&

case, that we would not have the confusion that we have today

in this field of obscenity»

And it is my

MR. LIVAUDAIS:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it

3

please the Court:

Before the noon recess I had, for all

4

practical purposes, concluded the bulk of my argument.
At this time I' would like to sura up what I consider

5
S

the major points of my argument; one is: the jurisdictional

7

question, which I think that we have answered clearly as far as

®

the injunctive intent of the Three-Judge District Court in this

0

case.

Also the fact that in cases involving criminal prosecu­

10

tions, there are adversary judicial hearings, and that in light

11

of this Court’s summary affirmation of the Milky Hay and Mew

12

York Feed cases, that there is no need to have this hearing

13

prior to arrest of the defendant in the case.

14

This, in effect,

That this extraordinary protec­

We do feel that there has been a definite abuse of

20

the Court’s discretion under the provision and the mandates of

Article 2283 and of the dictates of this Court in the Donbrowsk L

only ones before this Court today, have been held, constitu­

tional and there has been no appeal taken from this decision

of the Court by Appellees in this case.
We feel that there has been an abuse under the

case of Golden v. Zwicker, which enlarged this Court's view­

12

points in Zwicker v» Koota in which this Court specifically

13

has referred to Zwicker v. Koota from which it originated,

14

that there must be a controversy of sufficient immediacy and

15

reality.

16

in our case and that there are no pending prosecutions under

17

that ordinance and there were no, in view of the fact that the

18

prosecutions had been terminated, there were no threats of any

19

future prosecutions under that ordinance.

20

There was no such issue before the Three-Judge Court

So, here we have a case of clear abuse by a Three-

21

Judge Court under the provisions of 2283 by interfering with

22

state court prosecutions and going even further than that in

23
24

25

legislating criminal procedure for state courts and I think that
in doing' this that these Federal Three-Judge, that this court
has abused its powers and usurped the powers of this Court in

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JACK PEEBLES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

MR. PEEBLES:

&

9

Very well.

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

I think there are basically three issues which this

10

case presents to this Court at this tine.

First, there is the

11

threshold question of whether or not this Court has jurisdic­

12

tion of this appeal in view of the provisions of Section 1253.
Once that hurdle is passed, I submit that the issues

13
14

then are: first, did the court below use its discretion in

15

granting

16

Federal Anti-ihjmiction Statute, prevent the court below from

17

taking the action that it took?

IS

the relief it granted or does Section 2283, the

And then the fourth question: if this Court has

19

jurisdiction and the court below properly considered the

20

issues on the merits below, then did it properly decide the

21

22
23

24
25

merits in this case?
But, before getting into those questions, I would
like to emphasise certain facts in this case which I think are
relevant and should be called to the Court's attention.
When August Ledesma, the news stand operator in this
19

1

case, decided fco mark off a section of his news store in

2

Chalmette, Louisiana and sell within that section to adults

to which he would be entitled.

2

Now, there was only one prosecution in this case;

3

that’s true, but I think it should be pointed out further that

4

the deputy sheriffs made it clear that the rest of these

5

magazines that were in that store had to be taken off the stand.

6

The affidavit filed by Ledesma and by his attorney

7

below, indicated that one of the deputies told him on three

8

separate occasions: "You had better get rid of the rest of fcheS2

9

magazines," and of course, there was no doubt of what he was

10

talking about.

There would have been further prosecutions if

S3

he had not done so.
Nov, in view of this fact, the three-*judge court

call the Court's attention to the decision of Dial versus

6

Fontaine, decided by this Court June 29, 1970, with Mr. Justice

seizure proper?
That court held., in Dial versus Fontaine below, that
the procedure for seizure was unconstitutional and was declared
to be unconstitutional.

Yes, Your Honor.

Alid I can only say that in Dial this Court felt that

Q

Well, then there

It would seem so

to me, YourHonor, but in

13
14

view

of the fact that this Court held no jurisdiction in Dial, in
15
which case the Court were also required a .return of the seised
16

materials, then there may be some question about it.
17

Q

Well, if they —.assume a state statute, for

criminal cases under controlled situations and a man is indicted

trial and he sues the Federal Court to

21

enjoin, to have declared unconstitutional the state wiretapping
22
statute and to enjoin the use of any wiretap testimony in his
23
criminal trial.

And the Federal Court declares the statute

24
unconstitutional and does enjoin the use of any of that evidence.

25

Yes, Your Honor.

The appeal is

Dunn versus University

Mr. Justice Douglas dissents from the dismissal of

the appeal."
If the Court please, yesterday our argument, other
counsel fairly adequately covered, I think, the question of the
effect that 2283 may have on the Civil Rights Statute. Suffice
it to say that we simply take the position that the Civil

13

Rights Act is oneact which expressly provides for an injunc­

14

tion and it is an exception, and one of the exceptions spelled

15

out in the language of the Federal Anti-injunction Act.

16

We feel that the Reconstruction Congress of 1871

17

clearly intended that in an approprate case the Federal Court

18

should intervene in a state proceeding.

19

point out that in the facts of this case, 2283 should not be

2Q

considered a bar because the court below did not grant "an

2!

injunction to state proceedings in a state court" which is the

22

language of 2283.

23

However, we would

I think

it's a question of whether they specifically stayed the injunc­

ceedings below, then it would not be forbidden by the ~~

We

What worries me about it is in one paragraph

14

they say they are not doing it; they say, "We will not grant a

15

temporary or permanent injunction, but we will retain jurisdic­

16

tion ."

17

A

They did that, Your Honor.

13

Q

How do you interpret that?

19

A

I interpret,that, Your Honor, to mean that if

20

the state should resume prosecution they would then exercise

21

the authority to effectuate their declaratory judgment by en-

22

joining the state prosecution.

23

Q

That's my interpretation.

The only difference is that at that stage they

24

can't be held in contempt and the only difference between their

25

being held in contempt and not being held in contempt is a
28

1

little piece of paper which says ''permanent injunction."

2

That6s the only difference?

3

A

I think so, Your Honor.

4

Q

If you had refused to return the exhibits, as

5

ordered, and on the contrary, had gone to trial the next day

6

or 'very soon; offered them in evidence; do you think your

Yes, Your Honor.

There is no question about

that.
Now, with regard to 2283, yesterday Mr. Justice

15
18

Stewart, inquired of one of the attorneys as to whether any

17

studies had been made of the increased number of requests for

10

Three-Judge Courts, and their effect upon the judicial system.

n

Yesterday afternoon I located a comment in the April 1970

20

edition of the Harvard haw Review, which may be appropriate

21

there.

22

In an article entitled; "Section 1983 Jurisdiction"

23

the commentator pointed out that an examination of 100 private

24

civil rights cases reported in the Federal Supplement in

25

December, 1966; March, 1968, it shows that 67 were dismissed
29

1

without a trial or hearing, the vast'majority in the face of

10

Q

in the remaining

What that also suggests is that it requires a

11

good deal of wasted time of members of FederalCourts? it's a

12

problem that.perhaps is easy in a circuit like the Second

13

Circuit or the First Circuit, but in the larger geographical

14

circuits the very assembling of one circuit judge, which is

15

requiredby the statute, in two districts, that is, and they

16

are traveling to whatever place it is going to be held, can

17

add up to a great deal of expenditure and judicial time.

18

if, as it turns out, most of the cases end up by getting dis->

19

missed, I suggest it's a good deal of wasted time? isn't it?
A

2©

Yes, Your Honor,

And

Certainly this process can

2!

be abused.

Howeverif a complaint is considered frivolous

22

the District Court is under ho obligation to request a Three-

23

Judge Court.

That's right.

3

Federal Courts simply are not going to inappropriately inter-

4

vena, unless there is really a chilling effect by the prosecu-

S

tion in a state criminal case, then counsel will surely learn

6

not to waste their time.

7

Now- there for a while we

But, we submit that the decision initially as to

8

whether or not to implement the provisions of the injunctive

9

authority should rest with the District Court.

Federal-State

10

relations are not cemented for the future and we don't know

but that there may be some time in the future in which Federal

12

Courts will find it very necessary to intervene in these

13

situations.

14

We submit that the discretion of the lower court

15

should be respected and perhaps, to coin a phrase, this Court

IS

should exercise "Appellate Judicial Restraint" in that regard

17

and permit the District Courts to make their initial determina'

18

tion.'
Incidentally, the Sixth Circuit, on September 9th,

19
20

in the case of Honey versus Goodman, held that the anfci-injunc

21

tion statute did not bar 1983 proceedings even after the pro­

22

ceedings were instituted in state court.

23

the view of that court the Atlantic Coastline decision from

24

this Court, does not mean that you can't proceed with the 1983

action.

14

Counsel for

the Appellant has argued specifically on the question >f

whether an adversary hearing is required before an arrest can

We call the Court's attention to the fact that in

18

"

q

this case there was no judicial supervision whatsoever? no

19

application for an arrest warrant or search warrant# either and

20

none was obtained# in spite of the fact that they had all the

21

time they needed in order to attempt to obtain such.

22

I really go further than that and argue that the

Amendment materials are entitled.
Some opinions from this Court have indicated that
there may be materials that are hard core, and that these can
be recognised easily.

But, speaking from the standpoint of

someone like Ledesma, I can assure the Court that it is ex­
tremely difficult to distinguish between those publications

It is impossible to do so.

In our neighboring State of Mississippi we recently
had one Federal District Court to hold that the movie, "The
Fox," was not obscene as a matter of law, and a neighboring
District Judge in Mississippi held that it was hard-core
pornographyi the

very same film.

Now, there are simply differences in this area of
obscenity because of the subjective values involved and the
opinions of the Deputy Sheriff of St. Bernard Parish can be so
different from those of a news stand operator or an attorney or
judge that we feel the only serious approach to take, as long
as the Court does feel' that there is not an absolute right to

Feed and Milky Way cases, which asks fcfee specific
This time we

are asking the Court to reaffirm that decision, your decision
in the Milky Way and New York Feed cases, using your own words,
that once and for all these Three-Judge Courts will understand
what Your Honors are telling them.

This is a problem that

happens when we have so many Federal Three-Judge Courts inter­
fering with state prosecutions, each one of them giving their
own pronouncement and they are so different, as to cause great
confusion, in the law.
And our confusion in this field of obscenity has
been caused not by Your Honors in the United Stater Supreme
Court, but by the Three-Judge Courts that have so many varying
opinions as to what should be the law of the land in this area.

Q

You are now addressing yourself now to the

propriety of any action of the Three-Judge Court in cases
generally, but you are talking about the necessary antecedent
conditions to an obscenity prosecution; is that correct?
A

Yes, Your Honor; both, I would say.

But in this

particular instance concerning prior -— Your Honors have

spoken out on this, in the New York Feed and Milky Way cases.

that really should be made by this Court.

of the mandates of 2283 and let the conventional'.course of
