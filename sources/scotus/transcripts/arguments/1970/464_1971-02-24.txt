MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 464: Gainesville Utilities against Florida Power
Corporation.
Counsels, may I inquire: is it contemplated that

5
6

464 and 460 will be interchangably argued in both sets of

7

arguments or are you going to enter them completely separately?
MR. SPIEGEL:

8

9

Well, procedurally they are com­

pletely separate.

10

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

11

MR. SPIEGEL:

12

matter they are the same.

But, in terms of the subject

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

13

Yes; I realize that.

My question is,

14

specifically: in the next hour are we going to concern our­

15

selves with 464?

18

MR. SPIEGEL: Yes.

17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

18

Very well.

proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Spiegel.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE SPIEGEL, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SPIEGEL.

You may

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

idle Court:
The City of Gainesville, Florida operates an

24

isolated electric system serving some 60,000 people in Alachua

25

County, Florida.

It is a rapidly growing system with a demand
2

1

doubling

2

continue to build additional generating facilities.

3

every five years and a concommitanfc necessity to

There is* in Florida* and there was at the time

4

in 1965* an interconnected system of five utilities* all of

5

whom are interconnected with each other? were selling power-

6

back and forth between each other and generally applying to

7

each other mutual assistance.

8

x\rere guided by an operating committee and their interconnec­

9

tions were founded upon bilateral agreements.

1©

And their operations in general

The City of Gainesville desired to interconnect

11

with this grid or this pool* but it was not able to negotiate

12

an agreement with either of its closest neighbors z

13

Power and Light Company and Florida Power Corporation and

14
15

Q

Excuse me.

Florida

Was the city ever a customer,

a direct customer of any of these five utilities?

16

A

No, Your Honor.

17

Q

It's always been a municipally-operated —

18

A

Yes.

During World War II there was an

19

emergency interconnection with Florida Power Corporation but

20

this was severed shortly after"the war.
The Commission, after extensive hearings, under

21
22

Section 202(b) of the Federal. Power Act, ordered the inter­

23

connection and fixed the terms and conditions for the sale of

24

energy across that interconnection and for the responsibilities

.

25

which Gainesville would have to assume by way of providing
3

1

generating capacity reserves to the interconnected system and

2

in general, the Commission fixed the same pro rata terms and

3

obligations on Gainesville as would exist among members of the

A

pool.

5

Appeal was taken — a petition for review was

6

taken tothe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals by Florida Power

7

Corporation

8
9
10
11

Q

Mr. Spiegel,, would you

say 'chat broadly,

all the significant conditions for Gainesville are the same as
they are between and .among the other members' of the grid?
A

Yes, sir.

There are some minor differences;

12

in certain individual bilateral contracts.

13

the same, but the Commission does require that. Gainesville

14

abide by the operating criteria of the Florida Operating Com­

15

mittee precisely the same as other systems.

16

In general they arc

Three issues were presented in the Court of

17

Appeals? the fourth issue being whether the Commission had

13

authority to order the interconnection and the court upheld the

19

Commission on that.

20

sion should be required to condition the interconnection upon

21

•the making of a territorial agreement between the parties.

22

Commission had declined to do so and the court had upheld the

23

Commission on that issue.

24
25

The second issue was whether the Commis­

The

The only question on which the -— the third
question and only question on which the court reversed, was as

4

to a single aspect of the compensation arrangement.

There is

2

no disagreement as to what the price should be when the

3

economy energy flows through the system, between the systems.

4

There is no dispute as to what — again, no serious question

5

as to what the rate should be when they arrange firm trans­

6

actions, short-terra transactions.
It is agreed that Gainesville shall pay all of the

7

8

costs of making the interconnection, but the court took the

9

position that because Gainesville was small and because it

m

considered that Gainesville was receiving the larger part of

ii

the benefits that there must be some other charge of some sort

12

And it wasn’t sufficient to accept the Commission’s principle,

13

its rule that when interconnected systems operate together it

14

is the duty that each one carry its proportionate utility

15

responsibility and that is — and if it discharges that pro­

16

portionate responsibility it has provided its basic cost

17

burden.

18

Now, what the Commission is sayins is -this: that

19

whan a group of utilities are interconnected, each one brings

20

some load to the interconnected system and that load, say 100

21

megawatts, is a burden on the interconnected system.

22

fore, it must also bring some generating capacity to offset the

23

load which it brings and it must bring generating capacity,

24

not just equal to its load, but it must be something greater.

25

It must bring a reserve capacity so that in the event of
5

There­

1

failure of the generator there will he other generating

2

capacity available to the system.
Now, what the Commission here is saying is that

3
4

if Gainesville brings that capacity to the interconnection,

5

that extra capacity, that reserve capacity to the interconnec­

6

tion, which it woulU be required to do under the operating

7

criteria of the Florida pool, as each system under the Florida

8

pool is required to do and it would meet its basic responsi­

9

bility for not burdening the pool,
Q

10
11

power that it actually used?
A

12
13

Q

When the energy flows there

And there is no question about the

adequacy of that rate as a rate for payment for that power?
A

16
17

Oh, yes; yes.

are payments and likewise, when

14

15

Wouldn't Gainesville have to pay for any

Wo question.

No; there isn’t.

I don't

think there is any serious question on that.
Q

18

So you really do, under this Federal

19

Power Commission order you would do more than just bring

20

generating, make your generating capacity available to the

21

system?

22

A

That's right.

23

Q

You v?ould be paying for power if the flow

24
25

in your direction was greater than the flow in the other
direction?
6

5

A

That is correct and. vice versa.

In other

2

words, this is a mutual arrangement.

3

agree to back up Florida Power Corporation and through Florida

4

Power Corporation, supply emergency energy to any system that

5

needs it and likewise there would be payments from Florida

6

Power Corporation .

In other words, we

/

7

Q

Is there any i^ay of — what is the

8

practical situation.

Let's assume that your system was using

9

all the power you had within the system.

Let's assume one of

10

your generators went out, and your system was using all the

11

power that you then had.

12

A

Right.

13

Q

And then say there was a need for power

14
15
16

17
18

in the larger system.
A

Under those circumstances we could not. supply

it nor would we be required to supply it.
Q

You just wouldn't give it to them because

there is a way of — what would do, cut the switch or what?

19

A

Well, the switch can be opened.

20

Q

Is that what you would do?

21

A

If I understand your example, you are

22

assuming that Gainesville has a load in excess of 50 megawatts,

23

Q

Yes.

24

A

Even though it has 100 megawatts of

25

capacity, only 50 megawatts is than operating.
7

1

Q

Yes.

2

A

The other 50 megawatts has been definitely

4

Q

Yes,

5

A

And the power company would ask us for

3

forced

6

power in an emergency in their situation.

7

it.
Q

8

9

We could not supply

I take it that would be true the other

way, too?

10

A

Thatwould be true theother way,

11

Q

If you suddenlyneeded

power,

which you

12

apparently need some connections to take care of the emergen-

13

cies — if there was an emergency in the Gainesville system.

14

A

Right.

15

Q

And you suddenly needed power.

16

A

Right.

17

Q

And the larger system was

19

A

Like Consolidated Edison in New York.

20

Q

Yes.

22

A

That8 s right.

23

Q

They have no obligation constantly to be

18

21

24
25

then overloaded

itself.

They ooStld not furnish you the

power?

on standby status to furnish you emergency power?
A

That is my understanding;
8

that is the

1

service for which we requested; that was the service that we

2

would order —

3

G

Which?

4

A

That the seller Ss system,- the helping

5

system doesn't help the other system --

6

Q

Unless

it's in a position to do

7

A

Unless

it's in a position to do

8

it. How,

this is fundamental —
Q

9
10

it?

Isn't fchex-e quite a difference between

the litigants in this case on that issue?
A

1?

There is, and the court, I -think this is

12

one ofthe basic areas the court made where I think it tried

13

to understand the electrical arrangements but misunderstood

14

them.

15

Q

Would you concede that if Florida Power

16

were under an obligation to maintain a capacity which, under

17

any circumstances ■—- so that under any circumstances it could

18

furnish your emergency needs for power, that it may be that

19

you should do something more than pay for power?

20

A

Oh,yes.

If they are obligating themselves

21

to have 50,000 kilowatts constantly available on call for us,

22

which they have to give to us in preference to their own cus­

23

tomers, and even irrespective of whether they have to unload

24

their own customers, then we have a fixed standby obligation,

OK

i doubt they would be willing to sell that service at $3.08
9

i

per kilowatt -

2

3

Q
that?

Would you?

4
5

Yes, and you wouldn't expect to buy it for

A

It’s an animal that 1 don’t understand

in terms of the e3„ectrical sitaation.

S

Q

7

A

Well, you’re saying that -If they are obligating themselves on a

3

firm basis to have the generation and have the transmission

9

then it’s obligation that runs in the order of $20 or $30 a

10

kilowatt, yes.

1!

Q

Wouldn’t it be cheaper for you to build

'33

A

It would be cheaper for us to --

14

Q

IS

A

12

your own?

How about, that?
The thing that needs to be emphasised here

16

is that

17

the hands, first of all, in the dispatchers of the system and

18

they, under an operation committee of the two parties, and

19

they are in a position to decide when and under what circum­

20

stances the switch is to be opened and by whom,,

21

the switch and the control of the operations is in

Now, the basic obligation as it exists in the

22

agreements which are a matter of record in this case between

23

the various companies, all say the same thing.

24

when you receive a call for an emergency you shall give it to

25

them if you can do so without jeopardizing your own service.
10

They say that

1

Q

So you are saying

2

A

And they further provide in the body of

«D

the contract that if at any time the operations of the other

4

body, the power it's drawing, jeopardises your service you

5

have a right to open the switch,, and the Commission's order,

6

when it orders

m

the context of that*

i1

8
9
10

emergency service here, must be read within

Q

Well, you are saying Gainesville’s right

for emergency power is only whenthe power isn't being used
in the other system?
A

11

That's righto

And that's the standard

12

throughout the industry by which systems interconnect»

Now,

13

that doesn't mean that this thing — that the kind of emer­

14

gency assistance available is not an important thing.

15

important thing becuase what happens is every system pools its

16

reserves.

17

Gainesville reserves, plus the Orlando reserves, plus the

18

Jacksonville reserves are available to anybody in the group

19

that needs it.

20

Q

It's an

It's like a co-insurance arrangement? so that the

But isn't it based on the assumption and

21

practical experience that the same disaster is not going to

22

strike all the merobers of the pool at the same time and in

23

the same degree?

24

A

That's right.

25

Q

Now, the probabiliare that the
11

'i

reserve capacity will be sufficient and the system under most

2

cases — in other words they rwill have a -- they will make

3

calculations, probability of loss calculations for a total

4

system and they will conclude that we have achieved a stand­

5

ard so that load will not exceed available capacity morethan

6

one day in ten years»

7

It's those kinds of possibilities»

8

Q

Does the sole question here relate to

A

The whole question relates to compensa­

12

Q

For the power that they get?

13

A

Not for the power that is given, but for

9

compensation?

SO
11

14

tion»

the fact that the power is available.

In other words —

15

Q

16

for; isn't it?

17

A

They get the compensation when the power

Q

That's right, but isn't that the issue

18
19

20
21

This is power they can get compensation

flows.

here, whether it's too much or too little?
A

No; the issue here is whether Florida

22

Power Corporation should be compensated when the power is not

20•J)

flowing because under their theory —

24

Q

I suppose it still gets back to the
t

25

question of whether

compensation is too much or too little;
12

1

doesn't it?

z

A

Yes.

3

Q

I thought it did.

A

A

Overall -- overall, yes.

5

Q

And that's what the Commission has passed

7

A

That's what the Commission has passed on.

8

Q

That' what the court set aside?

9

A

That's what the court set aside.

6

on?

The

10

court, in effect, prohibits the Federal Power Commission from

ti

utilizing this rule of proportionate utility responsibility.

12

It says that this is inadequate based upon its understanding

13

the court's understanding, it seems to me, of how electrical

14

systems operate.
And it seems to me a clear example of a policy

15
16

fact determination which has been placed in the hands of the

17

experts, the Federal Power Commission and should be allowed to

18

stand as long as there is warrant in the record; as long as the

19

Commission's reasoning is adequate and as long as there is

20

substantial support in the evidence.
Q

21

Now, I suppose there are a great many

22

pool agreements, multilateral and bilateral, throughout the

23

industry in the country.

24
25

'

.

A

Yes, there are.

Q

Does this record show, or do you happen to
13

1

know whether there are other arrangements of this kind imposed

2

by Conuhissionorders?

3

A

There have been very little in the way of

4

Commission orders, and this is a practically a case of first

5

.impressions, of this type of interconnection *

6

Now, there is testimony by the experts of the

7

staff who have examined a multitude of interconnection arrange­

8

ments and pooling arrangements throughout the country and

9

they say, in effect, and they testify, in effect, that the

10

kind of standby chart that’s here being recognized, is con­

ii

trary to the general practices in the country.
Now, the court, you see, reasons that a firm

12
13

obligation has been placed upon Florida Power Corporation,

u

even though the Commission states specifically that we have

15

provided no firm obligation, no firm service.

16

ceeding from that erroneous position is concludes that costs,

17

fixed costs are being placed upon Florida Power Corporation

18

which the Commission says are not.

And so, pro­

And proceeding further, the court then tries to

19

20

decide or does decide that in its group there can be no

21

reciprocity of benefits between the system as the Fifth Cir­

22

cuit Court system views it, a big system can never receive

23

benefits from a small system and all the benefits go the other

24

way.

25

Bat, here again is an area that was discovered in
14

1

the evidence and is covered by findings of the Commission

2

where the Commission determined otherwise that there are bene™

3

fits flowing both ways, even though one system is smaller than

4

the other»

5

there is the availability of the reserve capacity which

6

Gainesville will have and actually the court assumed — the

7

Commission indicates that these benefits can be very substan­

8

tial.

There are power transactions that can be made;

Well, here again the court, without, I believe,

9

1©

reviewing all the evidence before the Commission, has sub­

1?

stituted its view on the facts, for the findings which the

12

Commission has made.
Now, I think the case is as simple as that.

13

It

14

simply is an area in which the Commission had a permissible

15

range of choices, where it has developed a practice and a

16

policy which is of importance in this case and could well be

17

of importance in other cases.

18

it's beyond their authority; that the Commission is in error

1©

on the facts.

And the court is saying that

20

I would like to reserve my remaining time.

21

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

22

Very well, Mr.

Spiegel.

Mr. Emory.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD W. EMORY, ESQ.

25

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. .EMORY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
First I3d like to state that this case doesn91

4

involve whether there should or should not be a connection

5

because' Florida Power Corporation has been offering to inter­

S

connect voluntarily ever~since this case began._And~-i filed

7

in our brief. Exhibit 40, which is the interconnection agree­

8

ment which we offered.

9

Weera opposed to a forced connection or a connec-

10

tionordered by -the Commission which we feel doesn't meet the

11

statutory standards of necessary and appropriate in the public

12

interest and not an undue burden on our system.

13

Q

How does the Commission order differ

14

significantly, in your view, if it does, with the arrangements

15

you have with the other members of the pool?

16

A

Your Honor, these arrangements with other

17

members of the pool are based on mutuality or reciprocity of

18

service benefits.

19

systems where there are special payments provided for.

20

have an arrangement with Gulf Power Company where Florida

21

Power Corporation is paying Gulf $5.80 a kilowatt per year and

22

we are only asking for $3.08 here.

23

the arrangement or interconnection has mutual service benefits

24

If it doesn't have mutual service benefits there should be

25

something to offset that lack of mutuality and --

We have two other arrangements with other

16

We

It all depends on whether

1

2
3

Q

You say that Florida Power doesn’t have

apy benefit out of this?
A

We can’t see where we would get anything

4

out of this interconnection»

5

be seriously criticized if we even considered spending the

6

mi 1 lion-and-a-ha 1 f dollars that Gainesville proposed to spend

7

on the interconnection,

8
3

In fact* we think that we would

The Florida Public Service Commission would
criticize us for wasting our money and the consumers would

10

criticize us for wasting our money.

11

understanding what this interconnection does.

12

13
14

Q

And that gets down to

Well* what's the million-and-a-ha1f for;

what are you —
A

That is the cost of — Gainesville

15

estimated the cost of the interconnection to our system would

IS

be a million-and-a-half dollars.

17

found $3 million* but there isn’t anything in the record to

18

support this $3 million.

19

don’t think that we would be justified in spending any money or

20

it because all it is to our system is a burden.

21

22
23

Q

The Federal Power Commission

We don’t care what it costs; we

Well* I had an impression* and I want you

to correct it if it’s wrong* but Gainesville was to pay that.
A

They are to pay that and they say that

24

that will be a burden* but they won’t pay it because they are

25

ordered to; they will pay it because they want to* because they

17

I

are not subject to the Federal Power Commission..

They are outside the jurisdic­

connection order; isn. st that this posture -~

7

This order

That's my point.

1

Q

But I'm not sure I follow what it is you

complain about in that situation.

14

A

We complain that we - our system is going

15

to be required to subsidise and support their system and give

16

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. SPIEGELs

Ifc*s hard for me to believe that

3

we're talking about the same ease.

ordered here of GO megawatts * and when you evaluate the

5

resources on each side of that interconnection the likelihood

6

that Gainesville can supply 60,000 kilowatts to the Florida

?

Power Corporation when Florida Power Corporation needs it, is

3

hardly as great asthat Florida Power Corporation can supply it

9

to Gainesville.

There is an interconnection

10

I think it!s clear on the record here --

11

Q

12

A

Mr. Spiegel let me ask you a »-

13

Gainesville has a reserve, right new of
/
SO megawatts and the Commission found in the course of the

14

years it would have a reserve running in the amount .of 40

ID

percent of its peak.

IS

So, that's 50, 60 to 70 megawatts.

So, we have power on our side of the system.

And

17

secondly, the Commission found that our units, though smaller,

18

but because they are smaller, are more reliable; our average

19

rate is much less.

In other words, any

reserve shortage in Florida for both Florida Power Corporation j

-Well, if we're going to male© it bilateral,

if we are both going to charge for everything we do for each

before the Commission?

12

A

I don't think so, Your Honor.

13

Q1

Mr. Spiegel, do you know whether Gaines-

!4

ville has any standby arrangements with private industrial

15

customers who maintain their ox«i generating plants?

16

A

No; we do not.

17

Q

That's a common practice, though, in

18

the industry; is it not?

19

A

There is a form of service of that type.

20

Q

Did the power companies charge for that

21

standby service?
A

22

I believe there are rates that have such

23

charges.

That's true.

I have, in "many negotiations, always

24

opposed such charges in any interconnection arrangement between

25

utilities both of whom have their own generating resources«
44

The basic position that we always have taken and
i

2

in many negotiations and in many contracts is that if we

3

supply our proportionate share of the reserve and make it

4

available to the other side on an equalised basis we are

5

making our contribution by our investment costs in the facili-j

6

ties themse.lves.

7

Q

That's all that was in the context with the

0

parties who are reaching this by agreement# because the

9

parties themselves# receive a mutuality of benefits;; isn’t

10

that true?
A

1!

12

might make a complaint to the Federal Power Commission.
Kgw, in other words, the Federal Power Commission

A

Always .

3

Now, this business about the size, the compara­

4

tive size between the Florida Power Corp. and Gainesville is

5

no different than the comparativa size between Orlando and

6

Florida Power and Light and still there were no standby

arrangements in that arrangement and in the subsequent
