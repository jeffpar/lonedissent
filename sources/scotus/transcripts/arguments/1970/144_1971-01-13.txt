MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Poliak, I want t©

tell you that there is no requirement under the procedures of

10

the Court that you use the entire amount of time allocated here,

11

and this applies to all counsel.

12

and though this is an important case, the issues are relatively

13

narrow.
MR. POLLAK:

14

We allocated two hours here

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

IS

Court.

This case involved a racially motivated assault on a

16

public highway.

constitutionality of the civil provision of section 2 of the

18

1871 Ku Klux Klan Act* now in section 1985(3') of Title 42.

It presents questions as to the reach and the

The particular terms that the case focuses on in that

20

statute read*, and they are quoted at psige 3 of the petitioner's

21

white brief:

"if two or more persons...conspire...for the purpose»

23

of depriving either directly or indirectly, any person or class

24

of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal

25

We would believe that our argument rests on

But we would see 1985(3) as formed by the Congress

3

in 1871,, at a time when it was concerned with private action

4

developing conspiracies which had as their objective the

5

limitation of newly won rights in the exercise and enjoyment

6

of newly won rights by the recently freed Negro slaves.

7

that purpose finds expression in 1985 and would find this case

8

right at the heart of the concern of the Congress in draftim

the statute.
Q

?©

Mr. Poliak,

And

1 can understand the conspiracy to

11

interfere with,

say. a federally protected right like travel

12

or something like that, but if the threshhold of 1985(3) means

13

that you have to have a conspiracy by two or more people to

14

deprive someone of equal protection of the law.

15

h

Yes, Mr. Justice.

IS

Q

And how do you have a conspiracy,

how does a

17

conspiracy to. beat somebody up, how does that involve a con­

Q

I don't see that being beaten up interferes

with my right to be equally protected under the law.
A

Wellc we are focusing on a climate where there

13

are a series of rights which a citizen has from the state and

14

from the federal government.

15

those rights, and the court used those particular terms in

20

would interpose their actions or conspiracies between the

right and the citizen’s enjoyment of that right, and they

22

would make that interposition because of the citizen's rights.

Q

2

Wells is it a right not to be beaten up or is it

the federal judiciary and that there might be a purpose to limit

his actions in that scope, if he is merely assaulted by two men

we would not think he would have a cause.

we would still not think he has a cause.

9

Q

Well, this is becoming clear now.

10

h

We think that this is what the Congress meant

II

in framing the statute, to use the term "equal protection of

12

the laws and equal privileges of immunities, equal to others."
Now, we believe, may it please the Court, that the

13
14

scope of

the statuteas to the rights protected is also clear.

15

Congress

had in mind not only federal rights under federal

16

Constitution, rights of national citizens, but also rights flow­

17

ing from

13

the statute,

19

States, as do other provisions of the laws enacted in that 1860

20

period.

21

the states, and this reflects itself in the words of
it does not say under the laws of the United

It says under the laws.
So we see the possible sources of power of the

22

statute as being section 5 of the 14th Amendment, section 2 of

23

the 13th Amendment, and the oft-recognised power of the Congress

24

to make enactments aimed at protecting rights of federal

25

cifcisens, power which the Court has recognised in various
15

1

decisions

2

Yarborough,, Logan, and others.
The primary statutory fount of power that the

3

Congress was looking toward was, of course, the 34th Amendment.

4

The front piece of the statute states that it was enacted to

5

enforce the provisions of the 13th Amendment and for other

6

purposes.

7

the 14th and other sources, but we would look initially at the

8

14fch Amendment and at section 5.

9

that it was the question in Mr. Justice Jackson's framing of

So we think that the sources of power can be either

Indeed, the Court is aware'

10

the opinion in Collins, the question of whether there was

11

power to make this enactment that led him to circumscribe the

12

reach of the statute in order, I think it is fair to say, to

13

say what he considered to fee a very difficult constitutional

14

question.

Do you think this case can be squared with
I mean don’t you have to overrule it?

We state in the brief, Mr. Justice Harlan, that

you do have to overrule.

19

Q

That is what I would think.

20

A

We think that the opinion of the court in

21

really say that this was all Congress was seeking to do.

some public accommodation, for the purpose of keeping one class

of people from having access to that restaurant.

in this casef

Would you

Well, we would say that if the picketing was

part of it, that you would have several sources to reach the

19

picketing that would be a right of national citizenship.

20

the picketers are addressing a deprivation of rights of

Why is there a conspiracy to deprive someone of

equal protection of the law?

And we agree with Mr. Poliak that the equal pro­

there is no reason to read it differently in this statute,

I couldn’t see the reference including the right

Well, it could be read that way.

We have ex­

pressed some difficulty on the facts of this case about tying

in the allegations of this complaint with what has traditionally

14

been denominated as one of the rights of national citizenship.

Q

I don't see why you zero in on the 34th Amend­

Does that tie you down with the 14fch Amendment

and limit yourself?

A

Well* a.s I say* it is a statutory case but

5

obviously the words of the statute had a background in the pur­

8

pose of the Congress that adopted the 13 th,

7

ments and contemporaneously used the same words and this* after

8

all* was denominated by that Congress as an act for enforcement

9

of the

14th and 15th Amend­

for the purpose of enforcing the 14th Amendment and

10

for other purposes.

11

in the 14th Amendment* we rely also on the 13th Amendment,

12

which I think is very helpful in this kind of application of

13

the statute.

We say we are not limited in our argument

Would you think this would apply to traveling?

Of course.

That is what X was hoping to get to
