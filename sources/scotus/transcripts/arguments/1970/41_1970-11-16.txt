OH BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR» SWIENER:

Mr» Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court, this case is up for reargument only the second time*

9

We argued this matter last Spring*

10

The facts, as I told the Court then---and Mr* Chief

II

Justice, I can confirm I think at least as far as Texas is

12

concerned there has been a tremendous increase in three-judge

13

Federal Courts»

14

Attorney-General’s office a couple of years ago and had 2 or

15

3 pending at the time, and now we have something like 30 and

18

no longer can I do all the three-judge work.

17

I think I handled all of them for the

So in all of the three-judge cases that I had, I

18

think I would trade the facts in any one of the other cases

19

for the facts in this one, which is before this Court»

20

This began in Dallas, Texas*

It involved the

21

seisure and the filing of a complaint involving an underground

22

newspaper. The Dallas Notes» in this situation the complaint

23

involved a violation of the Texas obscenity laws was filed

24

and the police under search warrant ft, went out and seised the

25

Dallas Sotos and not only got printed newspapers, they picked
2

?

up any paper that was around that could have been used»

2

got the furniture or whatever they considered might have, been

3

the tools or the implements of the crime,

4

trade these facts for almost any others, 1 think,

5

particularly like the facts.

In any event, charges were filed “-“misdemeanor charges

that an injunction be issued against the pending prosecutions,

The defendants in those State

against future prosecutions, asked that the Texas obscenity

11

law be declared unconstitutional.

i2

How this was done prior to anything really happening

13

in the State Courts, I would say.

14

that that is significant, at least in this particular situation.

15

But I don“t really consider

How the three*-judge court was convened and that

16

three**judge court held the Texas obscenity statute to be un­

!7

constitutional for two reasons,

18

its sections, purportedly punished private possession of

19

obscene materialp violating an injunction laid down by this

20

Court in Stanley versus Georgia0

21

or severe that part of the statute out and said they were not

22

going to make that separafcion—that whole prohibition section

23

is unconstitutional.

24
25

Gn®e the statute in one of

The Court refused to separate

They also found that the definition of obscenity
in this Texas statute was lacking.
3

This statute was passed

1

shortly after this Court°s decision in Roth and followed the

2

definition laid down toy the Court in Roth*

3

court below here found that this court had in memoirs in

4

Jaeobeiiis, enlarged on or amplified or explained the Roth

5

decision and if the Texas statute was fatally defective be­

8

cause it failed to have the redeeming social value feature in it,

7

S©„ for those two reasons,, the court below felt that the

8

statute was unconstitutional.

The three-judge

They did not enjoin the impending prosecution, but

9

.10

they enjoined .all future prosecutions effectively stopping any

11

prosecutions at least at that time in Dallas Comity*

12

I might say to the Court that the Dallas statute has

13

been amended since the—this decision, and we now have the

14

memoirs type definition, we have read out of the statute a

15

prohibition against private possession,, and as best we could

16

tried to comport with the decisions of this Court,
But in any event we do—this was the old statute.

17

18

We did argue it was capable of constitutional interpretation,,

19

that we didnBt have to return indictments for mere private

20

possession, and that if no redeeming social value was. a part

21

of the

22

care of by a court°s charge to the jury and I think this Court

23

in a number of cases has permitted state amendments to bring a

24

state statute into constitutional interpretation.

But, here we argued first off that the statute was

the injunctions should not have been issued because of this

meekness*

that prosecution were dismissed it would make it loose; as long

3

as we have possible prosecutions under the old statute within

its prior limitations,, I think that the case would still be

timely enough*

But it-—of course* I don131 think that even if

Q

But—
This 22 83* you have suggested* is that normal

for a prosecution imbalance to take that long to be tried?
A

Your Honor* insofar as 1 know in the field of

obscenity* there have been only one of two convictions in

10

Texas since the massive attack has been levelled on obscenity*

11

In other words here in the last couple of years*

12

tors are not that sure what to do*

13

when they are getting ready to try a case, what kind of proof

14

they will need*

IS

and let the jury and the instructione decide if the material

16

is offensive and obscene* as the Federal Government, I under­

17

stand, is doing in some of their cases, or do they need expert

18

witnesses to testify as to the

18

interest, no anti-social value repugnant to the community,

20

if those matters are concerned*

Q

So this—

When do you think you are going to get the

answers to any of those questions in the case here?

What is causing the delay in filing that case

in Dallas, Texas?

Well,, again,, I think that they don't know what

There may-

X think that
X was

r

down in Houston at a three-judge court hearing in that par™

i

ticular situation»

3

is a Houston ordinance that says that if you remain on the

4

premises while lewd or obscene devices going on you are also

5

violating the law and may be picked up.,

6

has to foe found unconstitutional that seems to me a good

7

place to start,

8

as this ordinance* and X think also better relations for

9

the police* but 1 don°t think the spectators were picked up,

We did not arrest the patrons.

But there

1 am not—if something

\

Q

10

X think that is a bit problematical as far

With respect to this particular case we have

11

here before us* the Texas courts have had just-about two years

12

now to try this case and this constitution in Dallas and to

13

give what construction they may want to to the state law, and

14

I wonder why that hasn“t moved forward, it. basnet been enjoined.

15

A

Well, X—

16

Q

-—And when you argue that a District Court

17

should abstain or should not intervene you argue on the basis

18

that that should be left up to the State .courts* and the State

19

courts in this very case have had two years and they have done

20

nothing*

21

2 just wondered what the reason was.
A

Well* I don51 know the answer to that, although—

22

except as 2 was suggesting* this decision was on the books and

23

still is on the books as far as the old statute is concerned.

24

So, as I say, I am sure they hesitate to prosecute.

25

Mow. I would say there is another factor, too-“-they
8

?

are worried now that they have gotten into the field of obscen­

2

ity fl about the case*,

3

So many things have gotten worse in this area since this arrest

4

was reads almost two years ago* that they probably would be

5

perfectly frank,, they don’t like the looks of this case*

6

have got Stag News to go after now, and this—the Dallas Notes

7

was very tame compared to what is being purveyed today*

a
9

They are probably up against Dallas Notes*

Probably part of the answer*

They

But in any event„ 1

do say and would like to add to what was said this morning
X think this is

19

as to 2283 prohibiting pending prosecutions,*

11

a possibility and 2 donet think this Court has ever complete ly­

12

se tt led thato

13

was a difference between pending and future prosecutions*

In Dombrowski,, of course,, they suggested there

14

But only for the purposes of that ease, and lt like

15

several others before me* —and it becomes kind of hard to try

16

something that has not been said before in this cluster of

17

pages—2 do think that it is just as harmful to stafce-Federal

IS

relations to enjoin future prosecutions as it is pending pro­

19

secutions*

20

I think as far as declaratory judgment act is concerned

21

which X have heard all you, X made this suggestion to the

22

Court, I don“t understand Zwickler versus Koofca*

23

time X was here X asked the Court to decide this case, not on

24

the basis of the injunction and the impropriety of issuance

25

but I think on the basis of the obscenity statute*
9

The last

At that

!

?

time you told me X was asking for an advisory opinion* and I

2

had fco kind of nod my head and smile sheepishly and concede

<.J

perhaps that was true* because if I won on the authority of

4

the injunction you might net have fco decide obscenity»

5

I suggest fco this 'Court that any time a Federal Court considers

6

a State statute* the constitutionality of it* and does not hear

7

or issue an injunction but merely decides that the statute is

8

unconstitutional* it has only an advisory opinion*

9

But

T.t decides the statute is unconstitutional and does
y

10

not issue ah injunction.

u

I say the only reason the Federal Court should be

12

deciding the constitutionality of a State statute is fco deter­

13

mine whether or not an injunction should be issued.

14

say—

15

Q

If they

I am not clear—I am not quite clearcounsel*

16

just—-your point is—-you mean we should say "It is unconstitu­

17

tional and we mean it®".

Your Honors* if you do not issue—-if the Federal

19

Court does not issue an injunction* the federal—the State

20

Court would be* some might say* would be free fco go ahead and

21

prosecute»

22

pending case* but. they did say the statute was unconstitutional,

23

Of course* this is not

24

enjoined future prosecutions..

25

unconstitutional and no injunction^ then the State would be

Mow, perhaps a State defendant

would then go back into Federal Court and say„ “Look,

And the thing that worries ms,

the second step,, the lady from Sew York pointed out, this might

harassment, but 1 know what,

else it might make it the second time around, it might make
it a Dombrowski type of situation, because here the Court,
a distinguished court of three judges said the statute is un­
constitutional, no injunction®

The State proceeds to prosecute,

so the argument can he made coming into Federal Court here, is
“look what the State is doing, lawless behavior, 'harassment,
and yet you, the Federal Court0 has said the. statute is un­
constitutional, Dombrowski type of case, ”,
By the way, as far as Dombrowski is concerned, 1
differ a little as far as the gentlemen from New York» 'the
State*s counsel 'from New York says, I think Dombrowski seen®
to indicate that you must have a statute that is vague on its
face, and, the special lawless type circumstances before an
injunction should issue in the future prosecution type case®
Yet our case, 1 say they are not Dombrowski circum­
stances, and so no opinion, no—the pending prosecution should
not have been enjoined®
Q

Should you not have said future—

A

I beg your pardon, future prosecutions*

Q

And don0fc you think there is some significance

to the fact that the pending prosecutions were not enjoined?

2

Isn° t there a negative implication there that—

&

—2 think that the Court felt that the anti-

7

the pending prosecution»
It also suggests that the Court felt that they were

not perhaps Dombrowski circumstances except that I don151 really
suggest that very clearly»
How the circumstances here were bad, 1 think» - X am

X would liked to have had some

13

other facts3 but X would say that there are no Dombrcwski

14

circumstances here because the statute is not vague and un­

IS

clear on its face and too broad»

16

Q

How is Pur lent Interest defined?

17

A

Let ms see, you mean in the old statute, let°s

18

see now—Obscene is defined as whether to th© average person

13

much difference in the glory and the beauty of the Federal

system since you have 50 laboratories to

MRo RICHARDS:

I have my supplemental brief on the

argument. Your Honor.

16

I have taken to address myself t© the issue of declaratory

17

judgment in a fashion slightly more—I hope slightly better

18

than we did the first round.

It is a a roll, thin blue brief in- which

19

The opening fast that I would like to convey about

20

our case here is that this was not a case in which the State

21

sought to abort a State Court criminal prosecution»

22

the contrary.

23

criminal cases in the State Court but were frightened about

24

future prosecutions which threaten the existence of this under­

ground paper.

W@ were content to litigate the matter in a single

14

judge°s court at that stage*.

The State then filed its response-

15

on March 20, ten days later, and urged, at page 43 of the re­

16

cord, that this matter had to be resolved by a three-judge

17

court*

18

that even though we sought wholly declaratory relief, that

19

nevertheless required convening a three»judge court*

That is,- urged that, as X understand their pleading,

So as it appears in the record at page 75, a three-

21

judge court was convened in order to determine whether or not

reinstituted a demand for injunctive relief not against pending

A

United States District Court, the northern

District of Texas., and before Sarah T, Hughes at the time it

14

was filed.

15

Q

Did you file any in the State court?

16

A

Did not file any proceeding in the State court*

17

We, in the State court, did seek to resist Federal prosecutions*

18

We filed motions to suppress the evidence and (notions to dis­

What has been done with their views?

Well, in this court—the lower court opinion

In the meantime* you long ago got all the

material back that was seised, didn9t you?
ft

11

Yes„

In that connection when we filed our

12

suit in the Federal Court* one of our principal concernss of

13

course, was to seek to return the material the police had con™

fiscateda

they occupied as their own residence»

When I asked the police officer why they were arrested,

19

the Delaneys, his response was:

they were there „ and the obscene mate .rial was found there, ob­

"They were arrested because

Now all of these things that you say are inter­

23

esting facts,—and I may say outrageous facts—but are not in

this lawsuit; they were not considered by these three judges—

Those are whole—

Q

—All your allegations as to 'harassment were

2

reserved for determination by a single"judge court, as I under­

3

stand Judge Hughes" opinion*

Am X mistaken?

4

A

Well,

I was not—

5

Q

She* she—she, in her opinion, says that what

6

is declaratory is the constitutionality of the statute*

7

at the end, in her order, she has found that Section .1 and part of

8

Section 3 of the statute are unconstitutional, and the defen­

9

dants are permanently enjoined from any future prosecutions»

10

And

And all of the Evi—anything else having to do with

11

the harassment and this would include these searches and so on,

12

I reserve for the determination by a single judge*

13

as X prepared for this ease, that the argument that those mat­

14

ters were not really before us at all in this ease*

IS

A

And I—

16

Q

How, the second—

17

A

—Well,

And assumed,,

I would certainly hope that X can bring

18

before you our motion, the case moved off on summary judgement*

19

Our motion for summary judgement, which falls on page 57 of

20

the record, states that Plaintiff in making this motion for

21

summary judgement relies upon the depositions that Defendant

22

Police Officers Snyder., MonfiqueC?) and Rogers (?), and it was

23

from those depositions from which I just read*

24
25

Mow, X haven“t, and we briefed and argued in the
—before the three-judge panel, and 1 did quite extensively quote
-

20

-

?
2

from the depositions in ray Brief to the three-judge panel*
Q

Hadn®t the three judges quite decided not to

3

pass on that part- of your case, as a three-judge court, and

4

instead to direct that for consideration by a single-judge

5

court and as far as it appears in this record, the single

6

judge is never yet active on your claim of harassment,
\

7

&

Well, if 2 may say, Your Honor, w® were invoking

8

the equity panels of our court* below, apd I think necessarily

9

’saying, to the Court that the facts that have gone before—which

10

are the facts that I have recited here—suggest quite strongly

11

the threat of. future prosecutionis and future harassment over

12

this statute» .and it was in this fact contest we would say

13

that the Court looked to the future with their preparatory

14

judgement, saying, having reviewed what has gone before, there

15

is a reasonable—very reasonable, in my mind—-apprehension on

16

the part of this Plaintiff that he will be subjected to future

17

prosecutions if he tri—and searches and seizures—if he con­

18

tinues to publish his newspaper,

19

Dallas police have done in the past, there is a fair reason

20

to think that they have not abandoned their efforts with re­

21

spect to the Plaintiff and his newspaper,

22

So the—

23

Q

24
25

And in light ©f what the

Sir*—harassment by the police is not the same

thing as prosecution by the prosecutors,
A

it is not the same thing, you are quite right*
21

f

Q

Insofar as your lav/suit, a complaint of har­

a

assment by law-enforcement officers, it was reserved for deter­

3

mination by a single judge District Court *

4

of future prosecution by the prosecutor, even in all good faith,

5

by such prosecutor., was—that was based upon the unconstitu­

6

tionality of the statute,,

Mid the injunction

Asa I wrong about that?

7

A

Ah, —»

8

Q

And—and the probability that there might be

9

future prosecutions, X would certainly review that.»

10

A

Well, if 1 might say, 1 know it is—

11

Q

You might also—

12

A

--it goes behind the court8s opinion below some­

13

what, but I know that Judge Hughes who sat on the State District

14

Bench in Dallas for a number of years, served in the legislature

IS

from Dallas County before coining on the Federal Bench—was

16

deeply troubled by what t© do»

17

for her to issue an injunction that sought to compare or to

18

prohibit police conduct, sit in judgement on the day-to-day

19

activities of the policed Was that more disruptive or was it

20

more to the point to declare that statute, which was on its

21

face overbroad, unconstitutional and in that fashion cure the

22

underlying evil, because it was this statute, the obscenity

23

statute, that was, we say facially overbroad, by which the

24

Dallas police were allowed in victimizing and vandalising

25

That is,was it more disruptive

I deal with this problem which does present Federal questions

4

an intrusion upon Federal rights.*

5

Q

What do you say she reserved?

6

h

In the opinion* the courtas ©pinion* the

7

summary judgement addressed itself solely to the constitutional**

8

ity of the statute and remanded to the single, judge ray prayer

for injunction,, my injunctive prayer» set instructions to the

10

Dallas police that they should not seise material*

11

12

case of civil harassment even under a lawful statut©0

13

think what they did—well* I am sure what they did—they re­

14

manded that, matter for further hearings» disposed, however, of

the constitutional question on summary judgment of which fche

16

facts I have recited to you were undisputed, that is» —

17

Q

It said —

So 1

2 suppose that if the statute—you start off

18

the subject that fche statute is unconstitutional--the case is

19

no different than what it would be if the Mew York Times was

20

being taken over by investigators and the police in pressman“s

21

clothes and what-not—-it would be a form of censorship* X sup­

22

pose* like Mirror (?) versus Minnesota» wouldn°fc it?

23

it was as clear as one can imagine, of course*

but that is what the Dallas police were engaged in during—
Q

But I was told if fche statute is constitutional»
23

-

i

1

then you have a different question»

2

Q

Quite different.

3

But as 1 say 2 think the lower court can always

4

can always—that conceivably by declaring the statute uncon­

that they were relying upon its overbreadth and swarming around

Parenthetically the injunction at issue, the court®s

declaring the statute unconstitutional; on June 10, 196% the

n

Texas Legislature enacted its amended statute which.Mr? Zwiener

12

has alluded to, so for all prac—■and also the injunction ran

13

only to the Plaintiff, it didn8t run to a broad class of

14

Plaintiffs, it did not run to the world at large, . So the

IS

injunction that was issued is a very narrow injunction, pro­

16

tecting this Plaintiff against prosecution under the' old

statute and declared that statute unconstitutional,

•

We had a-»-! might say* I think the substance of
the relief that we obtained below was declaratory relief»
this is what we were seeking.

So

We were seeking it, as I say, on

behalf of a continuing enterprise, as continuing as best it
could under the circumstances of a paper that was published
every two weeks»

At the point where he caras into court,

the Plaintiff lost all his help, they were afraid to come
around to his address for fear they would get hassled by the
police and at the police station»

He was putting out the

paper by himself at that stag®, borrowing typewriters or
whatever else property was required»
Q

It wasn°t you who asked for a three-judge

court» was it?
A

The State9® response to ns after we deleted

the declaratory relief in lieu of the injunctive prayer {?) ,
said this was a matter for a three-judge court»
Q

But you originally had asked injunctive relief

against harassment and for a declaratory judgement that the
-28

-

1

statute was unconstit Mtiona 1 at least as applied to your client»

2

is that right?
A

3

Well, to be fair, Your Honor, I had originally

4

asked for an injunction against prosecution2o 1

5

that from my pleadings and restricted my pleadings to the

6

declaratory and harassment*
The State still took the position that the three-

7

8

deleted

judge court, was required and at that point Chief Judge Brown
convened the three-judge court and we then amended our pleadings'

10

and only at that time did we institute our prayer for injunctior

11

against—

12

Q

—future prosecution?

13

A

That is right»

14

We have cited in our Reply Brief, the Senate Report

15

on declaratory judgements which seems to—-at the time that

16

declaratory judgements statute was enacted—-it seems to, also

17

in all fairness, that this is precisely the kind of case which

18

declaratory judgement is envisioned —-fchat is the Senate Report

1

in its concluding paragraph, with respect to preparatory judge­

20

ment procedures, stated, "Finally, it may be said declaratory-

21

MRo ZWIENER:

May I take the last few minutes here

■' 1 *

24
25

of this Court0a session»
There are only two things I would like to say»
34

1

First, as far as police activity in this particular

2

case, 1 would like to say something about that®

3

of the facts in this case* as I told the Court several times»

4

But the minute this situation came to the attention of the

5

City -Attorney8s office in Dallas they no longer—-police can°t

6

get search warrants for First Amendment printed material without

7

conferring with the City Attorney^ office»

8

tated the amendment of the obscenity statutes and this was

9

done not after the Court decision, but it—it—wheels began

10

to turn months before this court below held the statute un­

11

constitutional but it does sometimes the police do not act

12

properly, but I do think when it gets to the District Attorney,

13

the County Attorney, the City Attorney, our office, breaks

14

can be put on and really 1 think they can do it pretty well

15

without the Federal Court intervention»

16

1 am not proud

This also precipi­

1 would say something about this declaratory judge-

17

men to

Apparently the plaintiffs here or a number of people

18

here are asking declaratory judgement doctrine be extended to

19

encompass just everything—-that one judge in a declaratory

20

judgement can pass on any State statute that somebody is

21

worried about, and the rediculousneas of this thing is that

22

we have lad an attack on our sodomy statute®

23

and said, IfWe v?ould like to practice sodomy in our bedroom

24

but this statute is bothering use the existence of it®"

25

that day that was a case of controversy? there were several
-

35

A couple came in

And

other parties to this but this can, I think, show the extent
that this thing can lead to»
&gainf I suggest really, and 1 don*t—-I apologise
to the Court in a sense for saying this, but Zwickler versus
Koota which tells the lower federal courts that they should
consider the constitutionality of State statutes even where
no injunction is proper, I think is authorizing advisory
opinions„
Thank you, if there are no other questions, sir„
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
gentlemen»

Thank you*

Thank you

The case is submitted„

thereupon,at 3:00

p„

t.0

the consolidated

rearguiaent in the above-entitled matter, was concluded»)
