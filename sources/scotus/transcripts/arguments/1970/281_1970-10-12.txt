These cases» No. 281 and 349» ar® here on writs

The Fourth Circuit adopted a new

reasonableness test» approved the plan of the District Court
for the junior and senior high schools, and vacated the
decision and directed further consideration of a plan for the
elementary schools requiring that the District Court apply a
reasonableness test.
The plaintiffs petitioned this Court for certiorari.
This Court gran ted certiorari in No. 281 on June 30th,
reinstated the District Court8s plan of desegregation, and
authorised further hearing by the District Court, as had been
directed by the Fourth Circuit.

i

The District Court conducted further hearings in
July 1970» and on August 3, 1970» applying the Fourth Circuit's;
new test of reasonableness, found the plan that it had directed:
-

3

-

!

in February 1970 to be reasonable and reinstated its February

E

5th order»

The School Board appealed to the Fourth Circuit and

4

petitioned this Court for certiorari prior to the decision by

5

the Fourth Circuit.

6

October <5th, along with the petition of the School Board to

7

review the plan of the Court with respect to the junior and

8

senior high schools which the Fourth Circuit had approved as

reasonable.

Sobiloff noted in his dissent that the extensive segregation

Q

How do you define a racially identifiable school

to use your phrase?
A

Cue

,

your Honor, that has a substantially

4

disproportionate number of black students in the school in

5

consideration of the percentage of black students in the system,

6
1

Q

In the system it is about 71 per cent white 'and

29 per cent black* . Am I correct about that?

8

A

That is correct, your Honor.

9

Q

So that if a school is 50-50, is that racially

10
11

12

13

identiflabie?
A

Your Honor, I think it would depend upon the

circumstances of the case and the facts in the case.
Q

Well,, how about the facts of this case, this
;

14
15

school system?
A

What is a racially identifiable school?
I think that in excess of 50 per cant black

16

in a particular school would make that school racially

17

identifiable.

18
19

Q

And how much percentage white?

i
!
i
!

71 per cent

would exactly reflect the school population in the school

\

}

20

district, so I expect 71 per cent white would hardly be

21

racially identifiable as white, would it?

22

A

I think that is correct, sir.

23

Q

How high would it have t© get to be racially

24
25

,

identifiable?
A

In this system, your Honor, I think that 90 per
-

7

-

'1

white or in excess of 90 per cent white would perhaps make it

z

racially identifiable.

3

Q

So a school in this system, and confining
I

4

ourselves to this system, a .school with 90 per cent or more

5

white students would bs racially identifiable, and a school

6

with 50 per cent or more Negro students would be racially
I

identifiable.

7
8

A

That is correct.•

9

Q

Was that the test of that phrase used in the

10

District Court?

11

bringing if. down to facts or figures than just that loose

12

phrase, "racially identifiable".
A

13

I could not really find any further statement

Maybe I missed something.

Your Honor, I think that the District Court

14

was basically concerned with the racially identifiable black

IS

schools, but in the November decision of ‘the District Court,

16

which appears

17

the schools it considers to be racially identifiable white

18

and racially identifiable black.

19

Hare the Court eays that schools that are 86 or 89 per cent

I
Q

1

£0 the Court's figure is 86 rather than 90 per
j

cent.

23

A

That is correct.

24

Q

And is the Court's figure 5© .par cent black to

25

make that a racially identifiable black school?

I

A

That is correct# your Honor.

Q

These schools all had their origin# did they

not# in a state supported system of segregated education?
A

That is correct# your Honor.

Q

I don't know, and 1 am asking for information.

Is there any state in the United States that at one time or
another, historically# maybe 100 or 150 years ago# did not have
segregated schools?
A

That did not have segregated schools?

Q.

Yes.

A

I am not familiar with that.

I don't know.

do know that in this system —
Q

it was more recent.

A

That is right# and that the practices of the

Board which par ofcwafced the segregated system continue-

down

through the present day.
We respectfully submit that the segregated school
system considered by the District Court below was the result
of the blatant practices of the School Board designed to
perpetuate a racially segregated system, that the District
Court directed a plan that was both feasible and «effective
to accord equal educational opportunities to the black
children# that the reasonableness test of the Fourth Circuit
would merely postpone the enjoyment of Constitutional rights
by black children! in the system# that the School Board# the

in this matter offer no viable alternative Constitutional

standard to that: followed by the District Court below, and

4

that this Court should now clearly announce the rule that

3

every blade child who has been segregated or denied equal

6

educational opportunity by state practice is tc be free from

7

assignment to identifiable black schools in ©very grad® and

8

every state of his educational experience.
The District Court describes Charlotte-Mecklenburg,

9
10

and I quote, "The central city may be likened to an automobile

11

hubcap, the perimeter area to a wheel, and the county area to

12

a rubber tire." We have here a map which shows the Charlotte

\
l

.

13

and Mecklenburg County area that the Court was concerned with. I

14

The area that the Court was principally concerned with was the

15

central area ©f the city, which the Court likened to a hubcap.

16

This is where the blacks are principally located in the city,

17

The Court described the dividing line between the black and
white residents in the city as the Southern Railroad line.

95 per cent of the black residents 1st the city are concentratedj

in the small northwestern part of the city.
The District Court found, and this finding was

21

22

approved by the Fourth Circuit, that governmental practices

23

had created and contributed to these racially segregated

24

patterns.

On® of the most pervasive was the practice of the

1954o

Both before and after 1954 the Board located schools

and controlled school sites to perpetuate segregation.

Several

all blade and all whit© schools have been built or have had
additions since 1954.

The Board limited the capacities of

schools, controlled grade structure and school district, and
used transportation to perpetuate segregation.
The District Court found that the Board had limited
and controlled school sizes; and districts to perpetuate
segregation, and of the 23,600 students transported in this
system in 1969-79, only 541 were transported to black schools.
The Court further considered the governmental
practice which had contributed to the segreget tad. housing
pattern„

The Court considered the urban renewal program,

public housing, zoning, city planning, streets and highways
and private discrimination.

All of these practices had

interacted and created or fostered the segregated system that
was before the District Court.
Additionally, state constitutional and statutory
provisions which the District Court collected is. its August
3rd opinion all contributed to the segregated system.
The Fourth Circuit found compelling evidence to
support the findings of governments,lly created segregated
schools and housing, and accepted the District Court's findings
on the traditional practices of appellate review.

The

government concedes these findings, and indeed asserts that
-

contributed to *■he segregated system.

it, Mecklenburg County, outside of the city school situation.,

Am I wrong about that?

A.

That is right, your Honor.

Q

2 am right about that?

A

That is correct.

13

Q

1

I further understand that the big argument is

£

about the elementary schools.

There is a somewhat more limited

3

and minor argument about the high schools involving the transfer

4

of some 300 students outward.

But the big controversy is

5

about the elementary schools.

Am I wrong about that?

6

A

That is correct, your Honor.

7

Q

Thank you.

a

Q

Mr. Chambers, let me bring you back to Mr.

9

Justice Stewart's inquiry as to your definition of a racially

10

identifiable school.

11

under no circumstances in a unitized system could a school be

12

beyond the prescribed racial balance?
A

IB
14

17

Yc.ur Honor, 1 was addressing my answer to the

Charlotte-Meeklenburg system.

15

16

Do I understand from your question that

Q

I would like you to answer as a matter of genera 1

A

Your Honor, I think it again would depend on

principle.

IS

the circumstances of the case.

10

identifiable school, it would be.one where the concentration

20
21

22
23
24
25

As we define racially

of black students,- is substantially disproportionate to the
percentage of black and white students in the system.
Q

Than it follows from that if -there is one

school beyond the limits that you propose, then it is not
unitized, or the system is not unitized.
A

I would agree, your Honor, provided that there
14

1

are plans available which can be implemented to eliminate that

2

disproportionate representation.

3

4

Q

This means then that you are arguing for racial

No, your Honor,, we are not arguing for racial

balance.

be saying»

Circuit seemed to apply, ard the feasibility approach of the

25

Do you draw

District Court?
A

18
19

One other question.

Yes, I do, your Honor,

The Fourth Circuit

begins its test — and I might say this is basically the test
that is proposed by the government — with a statement that
some schools can remain all black or segregated in a unitary
system»

It talks about the limits that might be imposed.

The j

;
test that we are proposing is on® that began with the assumption
that all schools can be desegregated, and would require that
these schools be desegregated unless no plan would be workable
-

15

-

i

1

z
3

or could possibly be implemented.
Q

So there is a difference between feasibility

and reasonableness.

4

A

Yes, your Honor.

5

Q

How would you apply this standard to a city o:;

6

an area, a school area, which was 97 per cent white and 3 per

7

cent Negro?

8

system must be roughly 97-3?

9
10

A

Do you mean that every school, each, school in that

No, your Honor, we are not arguing for an

absolute ratio or percentage in each school.

We are arguing
'

!1

only for a test which would require no substantially

»2

disproportionate representation or concentration of black

13

students in a particular school.

14

Q

Obviously, or I should think obviously, very

13

likely in a 97-3 ratio, ?ovl would not have any all black

18

schools, all Negro schools, would you, but would you conceive

17

that there might be some all white schools?

18

A

Your Honor, I can91 say, because it would
i

19

depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.

20

Q

You mean on the location ©f the 3 per cent.

2!

A

That could fce a factor, yes sir.

22

Q

If they were scattered evenly through the total

23

area, then the natural consequence even of the neighborhood

24

school concept would take care of that, probably,wouldn't it? f

j
I

25

A

Your Honor, 1 have some difficulty with the
16

f

neighborhood school, but if -the students are assigned
2

according to non-racial district lines —

I
Q

3

I

cirri

assuming that.

That is part of my

4

hypothesis, that no effort was made to direct them to a

5

particular place.

6

inevitably be some all white schools probably in that kind

7

of system.

9

It could happen.
A

3

But you do concede that there would

Your Honor, it might, but again I am talking

about a hypothetical case, and I can’t really discuss it,

10

because it would till depend on what the facts in the situation

11

would be.

12

Q

Them conversely, if you had a 97 per cent

13

Negro, 3 per cent white, then you might again unavoidably

14

have some all-black, all Negro, isn't that true?

15

A

Your Honor, again it would depend on the

16

circumstances and facts.

It might, but with all factors that

17

the Court should consider, it might be that all of the students

18

could be assigned to schools without any substantial

19

disproportionate representation of blacks in any school, or

20

concentration.

*

21

Q

But. I clears from your answer, since you said it

22

depends on the facts, that you are suggesting that there is

23

not an absolute Constitutional requirement to take this

24

percentage and mechanically put it in effect in each

25

individual school in the system.
-

17

-

i

A

That is correct, your Honor.

I would say,

2

however, as the District Court sought, to do here, that it

3

might be an ideal objective that a District Court or school

4

board might use in its discretion to prepare a plan.
The District Court sought to direct a plan that would

5

6

utilize the various techniques that had been utilized by the

7

fact in this record is that the School Board had purposely

by the Court consultant.

Q

When there is a satellite district, and I am

really trying to get the definition of terms, I had thought
that involved one way bussing usually outwardly to a school
from an area where there was no longer a school.

A

The way the satellite districts are proposed

1

here no junior high school is in the satellite area.

Q

Any more.

Any more.

The other example that w© have is

and the Board's plan is shown in red.

Again the satellite districts are shown in black

7

Q

Would you mind defining satellite?

8

A

Satellite,

9

your Honor, is a non-contiguous

zone established to serve a school district.

For instance,

10

the satellite district here would be the black zone which is

11

not contiguous to the black zone around Cochrane Junior High

12

School.

13

As the Court pointed out la its opinion also, the

14

efforts of the School Board to use contiguous grids ignored

15
16

17
18
19

20
21
,22

23
24
25

the traffic arteries.

The grid zones that the Board sought to

adhere to ran diagonally to the traffic.

Both the superintend© rvi

of schools and the Court consultant said that the plan directed
by the Court, or the Court consultant plan, would be much
easier to implement.
Q

That is because the second plan took the flow

of traffic into account more realistically.
A

That is correct, your Honor.

Q

Did this significantly shorten the travel time?

A

It shortened the travel time, and was also

easier to implement because we had the traffic arteries that
-23

-

were considered by the Court consultant in proposing the

2

satellite districts,

3

Q

Did did shorten the traffic time significantly?

4

A

Yes, your Honor, because the satellite

5

districts use the traffic arteries, where the zone lines,

6

the contiguous zones, did not.

7

in the narrow corridors proposed by the Board would not even

3

be on a street that could be serviceable for the school to

9

which the students were, assigned.

Some students, for instance,

This is equally true of the elementary schools.

10

The

11

Board proposed again to adhere to contiguous zones.

12

proposed to limit the schools that white students could be

13

assigned to to schools having 60 per cent or more white

14

students.

15

elementary schools SO per" cent or more black.

proposed by the Court consultant did not limit itself to

With two way movement.

Q

What is clustering?

8

A

9
10

Clustering means the pairing, if on® might

use that word, or grouping of three or more schools.
Q

But usually what you do is enlarge the son©

around two or more school buildings.

11
12

A

Isn’t that about it?

That is possible, your Honor, or you might

13

use the school -district that is not contiguous with the school

14

district that is used —

17
: 18

Q

1 thought that would be pairing, then, rather

than elusfeering«
A

We are. talking about number of schools for

pairing, and we are talking about an increased number of

10

schools for clustering.

In the plan here, for instance, that

20

Was proposed by the Court consultant, the colors show the
'

21

schools that are clustered,

22

the inner city is Lincoln High School, and it is clustered

23

with Mexxy Oaks, Albemarle Road, and this.

Are any of these more than three?

They are all either two white and one black,

We will be

Mr. Chambers, at some point before you sit down,

13

I wonder whether you could summarise precisely as you can the

16

legal issues that you think must be decided by the Court in

17

this ease.

18

A

Your Honor, 1 think that the basic issue

19

involved is whether a school board can continue to perpetuate

20

segregated schools where these schools have been created by

21

state action when a feasible plan is available to disestablish

22

the segregated schools.

23

in its reasonableness test that some schools can be maintained

24

segregated in a unitary system.

25

We submit that on the facts of" this case, there is a feasible

;

Basically the Fourth Circuit has said j

We submit that they cannot be.

i

plan that will desegregate the schools, and that the District:

z

Court was properly correct In saying that all black schools

3

or racially identifiable black schools in this system should

4

b© eliminated.

5

Q

That is from the point of view of students.

6

A

From the point of view of students.

7

Q

There is no question about — or do I misunder­

3

stand you — there is no question about faculty in this case.

9

A

That is correct, your Honor.

10

Q

There is no single racially identifiable

11

faculty under your definition.

12

A

That is correct, your Honor.

13

Q

There is no issue her© about transfers from

14

majority t© minority, is ther*r?
A

15
18

17

Not your Honor.

We contend and submit that

that kind of provision will not'satisfy the Board0© requirement
to ©©segregate the schools.

It is a provision that the

18

government advocates should be included in the plan where

19

segregated schools; are retained.

20
21

Q

Wersn't it in the Board’s plan?

A

It was in the Board3® plan, too, but the

-

22
23
24
25

Court ©f Appeals pointed out that th® Board had imposed
limitations on the majority to minority transfer, which the
Court of Appeal® found to be unacceptable.

We think that

under the plan that the District Court has directed that we
-

31

^

1

can eliminate all black and racially identifiable black

z

schools.
Q

3
4

Do blacks object

to this plan?
A

5
6

Whet is the situation there?

Your Honor, it is my understanding that blacks

are interested in the plan being implemented.

13
14

A

They would not. be permitted to do that under

Q

What is your answer to the arguments you. find

the plan.

13

in the briefs that this would just be reverse discrimination

19

in the sense that some blacks ar© kept out of their schools

A

Your Honor, I think that this Court has

answered that question.
Q

What ie: your answer to it?
-

32

-

I
I

1

A

My answer to it is the same as this Coart's»

2

Q

What is that?

3

A

The School Board and the Court might legitimately

4

consider race, and has to consider race, in order to

5

desegregate a school system»

6

Q

Where did the Court say that?

7

A

The Court has said that in Green.

The School

8

Board cannot be neutral.

It has created a segregated system

3

and it has now to consider race to disestablish it.

The Fourth,

'10

Circuit has said it.

11

School Board, that a school board had t© consider race in

12

order to desegregate, and I think it is absolutely necessary

3
4

It said it in Weiner versus th© Arlington

here that the Court consider race to desegregate.
Q

My brother, Harlan, suggested that, you say

5

something about what the issues are.

6

to carry out your viewpoint as to whether a court has power,

7
8
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Is there an issue here

Constitutional power, required by the Constitution, to fore©
a state to bus students to schools and to pay for new busses?
A

Your Sonor, I ttrak that th© Constitution

requires that the school board disestablish or dismantle
segregated schools that ‘they have created.
Q

I understand that,

A,

I think that as a matter of an equitable remedy

that tli® Court cast utilize devices that have been used by
school officials to creat® © segregated system.
33

I think

-

II

1

further that the school board and the Court are not limited

2

to the same devices that have been used to create a segregated

3

system, but can go us® other devices that are necessary to

4

desegregate.

5

in this system — bussing has been used in the past to

6

segregate — then the Court can use bussing in order to

7

desegregate«

3

9

If this requires bussing, and it has been done

Q

rhen as I understand it, vour position is that

to put your viewsin effect the Court would have to hold that

!0

the Constitution requires bussing under certain facts, and

11

that the state can be compelled to buy busses to do that

12

bussing9 by the Court.

13

A

I think that the rule would be a bit more

14

general, that being that the Board would have to use what

15

means were necessary —

1G

17
13

Q

. understand all that.

I air, talking about a

con.creta thing.
A

If it would require bussing, then I think that

19

the Constitution would require that the Board utilize the

20

facilities to do so, to desegregate.

21

Q

In other words, the Courts could order the

22

states to buy a large number of busses in order to transport

23

pupils, and would be required to do so by the Constitution.

24
25

A

I think the Constitution requires it,

I think

the Court should require the school board to do what is
-

34

-

%

necessary, and I think, the Constitution requires —

2

Q

X understand all of the abstract generalities

3

about "necessary”. The question I am interested in, and maybe

4

it does at this time, is to carry out your view of what the

5

Constitution compels, & Court of the United States can require,

6

schools and states to buy large numbers of busses at

7

tremendous expense to the state in order to transport students.
A

B
9

Your Honor, may I answer that this way?

First

of ali,- I don't think the Court has to go that far to affirm

10

what the District Court did

below.

I think, however, that

n

as a Constitutional matter, it should be required.

12

Q

In this particular case, how many busses?

13

A

The District Court estimated it would be 138

15

Q

And the money was available.

16

taking.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Actually it seems to me this is an example of the

tendency of many points in the law to expand themselves to
•their logical extreme.

It is clear, I think, that with the

success which so far has been achieved, and it is considerable,
though in many places not enough, there has been anexpansion
of rising expectations.

Specifically 2 think it is clear that

racial balance was not regarded as the objective, and I am
using racial balance in the sens© of the brief from what I
quoted, racial balance was not regarded as the objective when
the Brown case was presented before this Court, or when it was
53

1

decided.
In the Brown case, the United States submitted three

3

separate briefs for the Court's consideration.

One was filed

on December 3, 1952, and was signed by Attorney General

S

McGranery and by Philip Elman.

GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, ON BEHALF

OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
(Continued)

9
10

THE SOLICITOR GENERAL;

Before I proceed to the

11

Chief Justice's question, I would like to finish the theme

12

of the argument which I was pursuing when the Court recessed.

13

I had just quoted from the briefs filed-by the government 15

14

and 16 years ago.

15

Q

IS

17

A

I think it is relevant to bear in mind that- -

Which argument was that, the first or the

This was in the second and the third arguments,

18

Mr. Justice, those briefs I quoted fro®.

19

with the second argument, and also the third argument, the

20

Court propounded specific questions to counsel.

21

in 347 U.S„ at pages 495 and 496, and 4(a) was as follows.

22

This was the question of the Court at that time;

23
24
25

But in connection

These appear

"Assuming it is decided that segregation of public
schools violates the Fourteenth Amendment (a) would a decree
necessarily follow providing that within the limits set by

/

1

normal geographic school districting Negro children should

2

forthwith be admitted to schools of their choice?

3

It is perfectly plain that the Court there was

4

contemplating limits set by normal geographic school

5

districting.

©

Now9 the oral arguments of all three of those cases

7

have been printed in a book called “Argument", and if they

S

are examined, it is found that counsel for the petitioners

9

there proceeded on the same basis that the contention was not

10

in favor of racial balance or the new formulation of that which

11

appears in the present brief, but was in terms of eliminating

12

a dual school system.

13

Then finally in the opinion of the Court in Brown

14

in 34S U.S., I think we find recognition of this understanding

15

of the Court.

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

This appears in the opinion.

"To that end, the Courts may consider problems
related to administration arising from the physical condition
of the school plant, the school transportation system,
personnel" -- and hero is the important passage — "revision
of school districts and attendance areas into compact units
to achieve a system of

determining admission to the public

schools on a non-racial basis."
It is apparent, I think,that 16 years ago when Brown
was decided, and 15 years ago when the decision on remedies
was announced, the objective was not racial balance nor the

57

I

related objective as stated in the petitioner's reply brief.

z

The conception of racial balance is something rather new, and

3

it has arisen out of oar experience in the intervening years.

I think there is ranch tote said for racial balance in many

5

situations.

8

the standard or objective when the Brown case was considered

7

or decided, and I do not think that it can today be proparly

8

found within the text or within the appropriate penumbra of the

9

two Constitutional provisions which are applicable in this case,

10
11

But my submission is that it was not felt to be

Certainly this Court has never so decided.
Now, with respect to the question of the Chief

12

Justice, if the Court will examine our brief with great care,

13

you will find that we have never contended and we have never

14

used the word “reasonable11.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

We have used it when we quoted

from opinions, but we have never used the word "reasonable".
The word which w@ have used is "feasible" and how far that is
different from reasonable is perhaps a question.

I think it

is some different and I will refer to it.
One of the chief reasons ws have used "feasible" is
because that is what the Court used in the Green opinion,
v;here the Court said that it was incumbent for the Federal
Courts to assess the school board's proposal in light of the
facts at hand, and in light of any alternatives which may be
i

24
25

shown as feasible land more promising in their effectiveness.
i
Now, I think that feasible is a stronger xvord than
58

I

reasonable.

Reasonable is a somewhat negative word»

Oh,

2

well, you don’t have to do that because it would not be

3

reasonable,

4

affirmative connotation.

You must do it if you can.

5

do it if it is feasible.

Feasible means practicable.

8

point out that even the petitioners have some qualification

1

in -their statement of the situation.

in their brief in the Mobile case on page 75.

9

“absolute unworkability".

Whereas, to ra@ feasible has a very strong

Perhaps that appears best
Their phrase is

That is certainly vastly stronger

SO

than feasible, but even that shows that there are circumstances

11

where they concede it does not have to be done.

12

is, "W© believe that our proposed principle forbidding

13

relegation of pupils to black schools except in cases of

14

absolute unworkability of integration plans" has a number of

15

merits.

16

Their wording

Now, we believe that under the test of feasibility

17

which w® contend for that there is a strong

governmental

18

obligation, an obligation not only on the courts, but also on

19

the school boards, not only to disestablish a dual school

20

system, but to eliminate the vestiges of a dual school system.

21

Here there is no doubt that there was a dual school system

22

really down to 1965, maybe a completely dual school system

23

down to 1965 in Charlotte, and in Mobile down to 1969, and

24

that much of the present picture is a vestige of the situation

25

which arose at that time.

obligation on the school boards and the court to eliminate

2

not only the dual school system, but the vestiges of the dual

In that connection, I would point out some things

to which reference has not been made.

But under the Mobile order of

the Court of Appeals, such children must be provided with
bussing and they are given a priority in the school to which
they go.

They cannot be told, "You cannot go to that school

because it is already overcrowded."
Q

You do not contend, I take it, that bussing as

such is an impermissible remedial measure.
A

No, Mr. Justice.

It becomes a question only

with the amount and the distance of the bussing, and there is
60

one last point I weald like to make, which is relevant there.

to do that in a district like Inscribed.

could also make this as a requirement, or state statutes,, as

A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

There are a number of these

devices which have been developed.
Q

But whatever they are, nevertheless, the fact

that the Constitution requires them is based, or the position,
that the Constitution requires them is based on past official
discrimination.
A

Because here you have what clearly was a dual

school system, and which clearly has substantial vestiges of
a dual school system, and a great deal of the existing
allocation of students is the immediate consequence of the way
the school system was operated in the past.

limits of his discretion.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, do you. suppose there are

3

many school districts in the whole United States, east or west,

4

north or south, that don't show the vestiges of prior

5

discrimination, at least when you include some of the elements

6

that are included here, such as the enforcement of restrictive

7

residential covenants prior to Shelley against Kramer, or the

■8

building of school buildings by school boards to meat the

3

demands of the children in those areas?

I wonder if there is

10

a single school district in the United States that does not

11

show such discrimination.

12

A

I think, Mr. Justice, as counsel on my left

13

will say, that when those cases come, they will build a record

14

and 1 have no doubt that they can show a good deal.

15

many parts of the north they could not show a racial zoning,

16

for example, which existed in the Charlotte case.

17

restrictive covenants probably have bean utilised in a great

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, did I correctly understand

you to say that there is a reading of what Judge McMillan did
and what he said in his opinion under which it would be
consistent with the government’s position for us to affirm him?
A

I think, Mr. Justice, it ought to be remanded

to him to find out whether he felt that he was applying the
standard that he had to eliminate all of the all black* schools.
I think what the Court should do is to establish what is the
proper test or standard here,'and then remand these cases to
the lower courts.for th@ applicationc£ that standard.

If in

the light of that standard Judge McMillan should still cease
out with the same remedy, I would think there would be much to

66

1

be said in support of his decision»
Q

2

If you take the verbal distinction or difference

3

in standard between reasonable and feasible, and you embrace

4

the feasible standard, as I understand it, Judge McMillan

5

purports to have applied the feasible standard.

6

in light of applying that standard, he found it was feasible to

7

eliminate all of the all black schools.

8

except on use of discretion?

r

A

9

Therefore,

How do you attack that

Mr. Justice, because it seems to me -that it

io

all turns on what his standard or his objective was.

If he

11

felt that his requirement was that he eliminate all black

12

schools, he said I can do that and it is feasible.

13

Q

If it is feasible.

14

A

No, he said I can do it, and it is feasible.

15

Q

Wall?

16

A

But if the requirement is not to eliminate the

17
18
19

20
21

22

all black schools, if the requirement on the contrary is to
disestablish a dual school system and to establish a unitary
school system, he need not have required as much as he did
require to achieve that other standard, which is ths standard
that we think is all that can be found in the Constitution.

racial ratios of 1969-70 is what the Board plan produced, where
we had 17 predominantly black schools, 5 predominantly black
junior highs, and one predominantly black senior high.

that is not what the Board is here urging this Court to

That is correct.

Yes, sir.

In other words, in North Carolina the School

Is that the only answer?

How do you go about getting me, the black

student in ’the ghetto, who wants to got out to another school

but I haven't the money to pay the daily bus fare, how is that

9

disestablishment achieved Constitutionally?
A

10

It is achieved Constitutionally.

Any child

n

who

wishes to get out of the ghetto simply makes application

12

to the school for transportation, and it is furnished free.

13

Q

We start then with the problem of bussing.

14

A

If this is voluntary, if the child makes that

15

election to improve himself ■—
Q

16
17

Then the question is whether the Board can make

an appraisal as to the number that would be likely to apply.

18

These tilings have to be arranged, not day to day, but year to

20

needed to transport the number that would foe likely to want to

Is that the problem?
A

No, this is not the problem.

We can furnish

Is that February 5 order also the final order?

A

Yes, sir.

If your Honor please, the final

order, if you are referring to the August 3rd order, I remind
the Court that there were those July hearings that were
undertaken as a result of remand, where the Court of Appeals
sent it back to the District Court, and he found his February 5
order reasonable.

Q

12

Didn't he say, Mr. Horack — I don't have the

13

opinion in front of me, but I have read it more than once

14

recently —■ didn’t he say that the touchstone of what the

15

ideal objective should be would be 71 per cent white students,

16

29 per cent Negro students, in each school building in the

17
18

district, but he realised that that optimum objective was not
possible.

But he said what we are going to do is using the

Court of Appeals language, what can reasonably be done to make

a maximum approach to that objective.

That is at least the

way he verbalised what he did.

I would agree, Mr. Justice, with your

Again I am going to allude to this later, but X
extent, you talk about the rights of individuals,

rights that Mr, Justice Whit© referred to, of the whites,
whether their rights are being 'imposed upon, or used, as it
were, and hence denied under the equal protection, I suppose
that a School Board can — excuse me.

Let me back up.

X think

that both of those rights at the ends of the spectrum, like
almost any other right under the Constitution, are not a hard
nosed absolute.

YourHonors will recall that we attempted to

develop that thought, which time does not permit now in detail,
in our brief, in response to the comments of Judges Sobiloff
and Winters and Judge McMillan, who views these rights as
absolute rights to attend a school with some acceptable mix,
100

1

and that is an individual right, and it cannot, be taken away

2

fro® them* it cannot be denied.
i

3

Well, to that I say, as we said in brief, that that

4

right, as well as freedom of speech, right to counsel, jury

5

cases and all of the rest of them, they all, and this Court

6

has recognised this in a long series of cases, are subject

7

to an application ©f reasonableness.

8

How, to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

’
i

9

that a school board can reasonably go to a point and require

10

racial balancing, or saaybe 1 had better say that they would

11

have to go to a point that might involve some mixing, a

12

countenance ©f the racas, as it were, but they probably could

13

not go, ©ven under their own inherent powers, so-called,

14

plenary powers, they could not go beyond the point inhere they

15

©dieted racial balancing.

'

r

16
17

18

Q

Let me test that with this question.

Could the

school board provide that all children in the first four
grade©, irrespective of race, go to schools within one mile

19

from their residence, and not have that provision with

20

reference to any other grades?

21

22
23
24
25

Is there any Constitutional

question involved in the school board6s right to do that?
Or is that discretion?
A

If your Honor pleas®, I think that it gets down

to the reason why the differential was mad©.

If it were made

strictly, if you would presume this with me, for a racial
101 -

1

balancing reason —

z

Q

No* I said irrespective of race, no racial

factor at all.

A

Oh,, yes, sir.

There is no Constitutional question there, is

A

No.

Certainly they can.

there?

7

As a matter of fact, it goes without saying

3

that school boards make differences such as your Honor

9

suggested every day in administering the educational program

10

for one reason or other of school systems.

11

concede that.
Q

12

Of course I would

That is because you think, as I gather it, that

13

the state has complet® control of its schools except so far as

14

forbidden by the Constitution.
A

15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

yes, sir.

With reference to this all black

school business, I would say this.

What is the nature of the

right — let us say it is a black child, although it could be
a white — what is his right under the Brown and Green
decisions?

It is our view that it is not a right to attend a

particular school of a particular mix.

On the contrary, it is

the right of a child to go to school in a system where every
vestige of discrimination has been eradicated.
Q

On account of race.

A

On account of race.

I would agree, therefore,

that if the School Board undertakes to evolve a plan, as indeed
102

-

1

the Charlotte-Mecklenburg one did, that evolves zones where

2

the net result — and where those lines ran had absolutely

3

no racial bias to them at all —

4

5
6

Q

I misunderstood.

X thought the School Board’s

plan did have a benevolent racial bias.
A

Excuse me.

X concede that.

It is that phase

7

of it to which your Honor referred that occasions our comment

8

that our School Board plan of February 2nd went far beyond

9

what the Constitutional imperative was.

to
n
12

13

Q

The plan in fact did have a benign racial

gerrymander.
A

I did.

Obviously it did.

Admittedly it did.

It went far beyond what w© say w© were required to do.

14

Q

That is what I had understood.

15

A

So I say that the right of a child is to ba a

16

part of a system, and hence that is th© opposite of what the

17

petitioners contend for, and that is that a child has a right

18

which must eradicate ©very black school.

IS
20
21

21
23
24
25

Q

This is perhaps not the individual Constitutional

right of an individual public school student, but rather

it is

th© Constitutional duty of every school board to operat® a
non-discrirainafcory system in somewhat of an analogy to th®
jur^» cases.

It is th© duty of a state to have a non-

discriminatory system, but it is not the right of any
particular defendant to be tried by a jury which is racially
103

-

s

representative of the racial makeup of the community.

that it?

I would say your last, namely, the duty of a

school board to establish a non-discriminatory system.

Q

That is the Constitutional duty.

balance.

That is his right, to be a part of that system.
Q

Then I did, 1 think, understand correctly.

A

Excuse, me.

I misunderstood you.

Back to this racial balancing business, time is
running short, but I would commend to your Honors' consideration
the following portions of the District Court order, if there is
any lingering doubt that Judge McMillan did in fact prescribe
racial balancing.

Appendix 710-A, December 1 order.

Appendix 822-A of the February 5 order.
Q

You ara going a little fast for me.
194-105

What was

1

2

the first one now?
A

Appendix 710-A.

That is the December i order.

3

That is where ha said the Court will start with the goal that

4

there should be the idea of the 71-29 ratio.

5

the February 5 order.

6

0

Could we go back a moment?

Appendix 822-A,

What is the

7

paragraph of 710-A that you are referring to?

I see in

8

paragraph 12, "Fixed ratios of pupils in particular schools

9

will not be set."

This is the December .1 order, 710-A.

10

A

Oh, yes, it is paragraph 12, your Honor..

11

Q

That is what I am looking at.

12

A

It starts down there, "In default of any such

"Fixed ratios”.

1.3

plan, the Court will start with the thought originally

14

advanced in the order of April 23 that efforts should be made

15

to reach a 71-29 ratio."

16
17
18

19

I don't know how well 1 will do on these other
paragraph numbers, but tha second is the February 5 order,
page 322-A of the Appendix.

That is the one Mr. Justice

White referred to.

20

The next one, which needs a little emphasis, also

PJ

in the February 5 order, 823-A, wherein the Court said that

22
23
24
25

the "School Board shall maintain a continuing control over the
race of the children", and then page 824-A of the Appendix of
the February 5 order again, "shall adopt and implement a
continuing program, computerized or otherwise, of assigning
105

-

1

pupils for the conscious purpose of keeping things in a

2

condition of desegregation.15
Q

3
4

Are you arguing that that meant the continuing

surveillance to maintain substantially the 71-29 racial balance

5

A

Forever*; you mean?

6

Q

I am asking you.

7

McMillan meant?
A

8
9

What do you say Judge

Is that for jx^st this year?
Mr. Chief Justice, your idea about that is as

good as mine, and I have none.
Q

10

11

Is that your question?

Well, what would continuing control mean if it

did not mean that he was going to continue overseeing .it?
A

12

Oh, I think very definitely that is what he

13

is saying to us.

14

as a Constitutional matter and as a practical matter from h,er@

I think it portends rather grave problems

I think Judge McMillan basically will be an &x officio

member of our school board for I don't know how long.
Q

How long has this case been in court already?

A

This case was instituted back in 1963-641,,

Q

And it is not settled yet.

So why worry about

the future?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall, we are deeply concerned

about the future, not only to acquit in full measure our
Constitutional obligation, and apart from the Constitution;
to fully acquit ourselves to the children, black and white,
in our community.

We want to get back to education.

Could I ask you a question, please?

You say

6

the School Board went beyond what you think the Constitution

7

required.

3

A

That is correct.

9

Q

Would you say it went there on its own

10

initiative or was it told to do so?
A

11

I think, Mr, Justice, th© School Board went

12

to this school board plan which we say went beyond the

13

Constitution "voluntarily*5 under the pressure of the District

14

Judge.

15
16

Q

How about the Department of Health, Education,

and Welfare?

17

A

There was no problem on'that score.

18

No problem?

No, sir.

their plan that is shown on Map No. 4 -as submitted.

The HEW

9

one group of children go for grades 1 and 2 here, and then

10

3 and 4 here, and in some of the zones the children go to

11

four different elementary schools during the course of their

12

six years of elementary schooling.

13

District Court Judge found, was about on a par with what his

And

Those in passing are a few reasons why neither the

HEW plan.

Are you going to argue at all about whether or

That is why we take offens© at the order of Judge

McMillan.
As far as the Court of Appeals is concerned, I must
digress to remind ourselves what they did.

Incidentally, wa

object to the District Court at all three instructional levels,
elementary, junior and senior high schools.

As far as the

Court of Appeals is concerned, what did they do?

Wa approve

of their rule of reason simply because in our view in the nasi©
of common sense you have got to have a rule of reason about
almost anything.

But w® say that the Court of Appeals applied
110

I

or misapplied its own rule in the sense that it, too, issued

2

a ruling that was based on racial balancing for these reasons.

3

What is it the Court of Appeals did?

4

they said, "School Board, you have not done enough.

5

McMillan, you have done too much.

6

and transportation and dislocation and so forth when that is

7

superimposed on the secondary level, junior and senior high."

8

So in effect the Court of Appeals found Judge McMillan's

9

elementary plan to be unreasonable.

At the elementary level,
Judge

There is too much bussing

He went back and took

10

another look at it, and found that sure enough, he was

11

reasonable all along.
At the junior and senior high school levels, the

12

13

Court of Appeals looked at it and said that is not so bad, 'that

14

is okay, but in so doing, they approved the satellite bussing

15

and the balancing at the junior high, and what is the most

16

17
!8

glaring example already..alluded to at the senior high, they
approved that.

That is the 300 black children from the inner

city that are bussed 12 or 13 miles cut to Independence High

19

that under the Board plan had a

They took the 300 from schools that we already had an almost

bussed those 300 black kids was to make a white school less
white.

So really, although the smaller problem, the most

glaring single example of racial balancing is the senior high.

Let me begin, however, by stating that it is our

view that Judge McMillan's decision, his desegregation order,

can be affirmed on either of two grounds, either on the ground

that he did not ab\ise his discretion in ordering a plan which

A month earlier this Court

Mecklenburg had 25 racially identifiable schools in which two
