ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH P. WORK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. WORK;

7
8

Mr. Chief Justi.ce and may it please

the Court;
I move for leave to permit Mr. Jonathan Mr. Stein

9
10

a member of the Pennsylvania Bar to argue pro hac vice on

11

behalf of the Appellees in this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

12

13

We will be

Your motion is granted

glad to hear from Mr. Stein.

14

MR. WORK;

Thank you, Your Honor.

15

Your Honors, this case comes before you on direct

16

appeal from a decision of a three-judge statutory court con­

17

vened in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the decision of

18

which court was rendered on July 13, 1970; and which decision

19

held Section 432(2) of the Pennsylvania Welfare Code uncon­

20

stitutional.
And that in denying general assistance to aliens

21

22

who are residents of the Commonwealth it violated the precepts

23

of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
The facts of the case. Your Honors, is relatively

24
25

simple.

The Appellee, Elsie Mary Jane Leger immigrated to
2

I

this country from Scotland on May

8,

965 and undertook

2

employment in which she remained for a period of four years»

3

She applied for general assistance, together with her common-

4

law husband shortly prior to December 9,

5

denied assistance at that time solely on the grounds that she

6

is an alien»

969 and she was

She commenced her action in the Federal District

7
8

Court on December 9,

9

amendment of the action to add Mrs. Jervis as a party plain­

10

tiff and to permit t;h© action to continue as a class action»

3
14

The Court subsequently permitted

Mrs. Beryl Jervis, who is the other party plain­

11
12

969»

tiff to this action, immigrated to the United States from
Panama on March

,

968 and after working for two years, ceased

her employment because of illness and applied for assistance»

5

She, too, was denied assistance solely on the basis of our

6

statute which prohibits the dispensing of assistance to aliens.

7
8

I perhaps said that wrong; it doesn't prohibit it;
it doesn't provide for it.
Presently there are two assistance programs in

9
20

Pennsylvania.

One, of course, is the categorical assistance,

21

which provides Aid to the Blind, Aid to the Aged, Aid to the

22

Totally and Permanently Disabled and Aid to Families with

23

Dependent Children.

24

gories of assistance in which we receive slightly over one-

25

half of the funds from the Federal Government»

These are all Federally-supported cate­

3

1

Neither of the named parties here are qualified

2

for any of the Federal assistance categories.

3

assistance program which we have in Pennsylvania is our so-

4

called General Assistance Program, which is wholly state-

5

financed and which provides aid to all other persons who are

6

citizens of the United States for whom no aid is provided

7

under the categorical assistance program.

8
9

The other

I am going to be completely frank with this
Court, as I was with the lower court and state that there is

10

no question but what this statute draws a distinction between

11

citizens and aliens.

12

doctrine had been overruled, sub silencio, as the lower court

13

found that it was, then 1 am going to have a very difficult

14

task indeed in justifying the distinction.

15

And if the special public interest

However, if the Court will bear with me for a

IS

few short moments, I should like to discuss just briefly the

17

two cases by which the lower court found that this Court had

18

overruled the special public interest doctrine.

19

The first of these, of course is the Truax case,

20

which involved the employment or failure to employ a person

21

as a clerk in the State of Arizona because of the fact that

22

tiie Arizona statute provided that employment had to be 80

23

percent citizens.

24
25

Justice Hughes in that case, however, specifically
noted that the special public interest doctrine was an
4

exception to the ordinary tests of discrimination.

He stateds

"This discrimination defined by the act does not pertain to
the regulation or distribution of the public domain or of
common property and resources of the people of the state, the
enjoyment of which may be limited to citizens, as against both
aliens and citizens of other states."
We will, of course, admit immediately, Your
Honors, that we realize that this doctrine has been somewhat
changed by your decision in the Shapiro case, with respect at

!

least to citizens of other states.
W© submit, however, that it retains full vitality
insofar as application to aliens is concerned.

Thirty-two

years later in the Takahashi ease this Court also said,
speaking through Mr. Justice Black, that the special public
interest doctrine was still in existence? although this Court
specifically denied the claim that the preservation of fish
within its three-mile border was a special public interest
for the State of California.
One thing I think, however, Your Honors, is very
important to note in the Takahashi case, and that, is, if 1
understand the case correctly the statute there also discrimin­
ated among aliens, in that -those who would have'been denied the
v

right to apply for the fishing permit would have been those who
would not have been eligible for citizenship in the United
States and therefore it would have applied only to orientals.
5

1

While the Court didnot make a great deal of this

2

fact, I do think that there was a very important distinction

3

between that case and. the case that we are talking about here.

4

Finally —

5

Q

Well, in what respect do you think it makes

A

I think, Your Honor, that we have agreed

6

a difference?

7
8

thatthere is no doubt that the 14th Amendment applies to

9

aliens, with, of course, the so-called "judicially-created"

IQ

exceptions.

1?

would therefore follow that you cannot discriminate among

12

aliens because the judicially-created exceptions are between

13

aliens and citizens.

14
15

IS
17
13

IS
20

I think it does apply and equal protection.

Q

j

So you say that you think the discrimina­

tion isn't on race or national origin, but on citizenship?
A

CorrSCt, Your Honor.

In our particular

case hare it applies to aliens, regardless of —
Q

Oh, you think it might make a difference

in the test that would be required to a discrimination?
A

I think it certainly should, Your Honor,

2!

because if the 14th Amendment applies to all it would cer­

22

tainly apply to say that you cannot discriminate .

23

25

I mean you would have to have some com­

pelling state: interest?
A

I really think that it would go beyond

1

that. Your Honor»

2

is justified, particularly not in the language of this Court

3

in

could be a compelling state interest to justify discrimination

5

among aliens, as between one class of aliens and another class,

I rather doubt that there

In other words, Pennsylvania couldn't give

welfare to everybody except Mexicans?
Correct, Your Honor.

9

Finally, this Court has intimated, I submit, in

to

those cases, such as Tashahashi and Truax# that the cases in­

11

volved the right to earn a livelihood.

12

gone one step further and said that, if the right to enter and

1.3

abide as granted to aliens under the Immigration and Naturali­

14

sation Act„ it would be meaningless if they didn't have the

15

right to employment.

And the courts have

IS

And I for one, Your Honors# am just old fashioned

17

enough to believe that there is still a distinction in our law

18

between the right to earn a livelihood and the right to re­

19

ceive public largesse.

20
21

22

Q

Could 1 be old fashioned enough to suggest

that both ©f them involve the right to eat?
A

I would accept Your Honor's statement com­

23

pletely and 2 think, if I may at this time, just by departing

24

a little bit# refer to a question which Your Honor asked in the

25

previous case.

I think in that respect# Your Honor# we get to

7

1

the question of responsibility.

2

is, and of course 13m getting a little ahead in my argument,

3

but if the Federal Government has the complete right to

4

regulate aliens then of course I might answer Your Honor that

S

e

And whose responsibility it

the responsibility for these persons, if it lies anywhere,
lies with the Federal Government, and not with the states.
Q

7

Hare is somebody who has been living in

8

your state for 14 years and paid taxes and contributed just as

9

mush to the state as you did, but he can’t make it.
Q

10

11

Does this record show whether these parties

or either of them ever paid any taxes or —
A

12

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that the record

13

does disclose that both of them paid at least sales tax and

14

income taxes within the Commonwealth ©f PennsyIvania.
Q

And the person was employed for four years?

wasn't it?

17

21

1

Yes, Your Honor? four years.
So she paid all of the taxes.
Yes, Your Honor.
Well, sine® you reminded me of the other

question I asked, what's the interest of the State of Pennsyl­
vania, other than money?
A

The interest of the State of Pennsylvania,

to be completely frank, Your Honor, is the conservation of
assets for its citizens.
8

1

Q

That8s money; that's money.

2

A

It is money; yes,

It is not necessarily

3

the state — due to the fact that we can perhaps conserve

4

assets for our citisens we were recently able to go to 100

5

percent of the Federal level.

6

I'm not saying w© couldn't have—- there is a possibility we

7

perhaps, couldn't have gone to that 100 percent.

Had we granted it to aliens •

8

Q

But anyhow it's money?

9

A

It is money? yes, Your Honor.

10

Q

And that's all.

11

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

12

Q

Are you in her© with just general assistance ?

13

A

Yes, Your Honor.

54

financed general assistance program.
Q

15
16

That's completely sfeafce™

The Federal Government contributes nothing

to this program?

17

A

Absolutely nothing.

18

We do, by the way, in the course of our informa”

19

tion we do in our Federal categories, we do grant assistance tc

20

aliens under

21

Q

22

A

23
24
25

mistake.

Why do you do that?
Well, honestly, Your Honor, it was a

The Department of Welfare —
Q

Which was a mistake: to cut them out or to

let them have it?
9

1

A

The mistake was occasioned by the fact that

2

when tiie Federal statute first cams out our Department felt

3

that they were required by that statute to grant assistance

4

under the Federal categories„

5

of the hearing before the lower court,.

6

That appears in the transcript

Going to the second phase of Appellees' argument?

7

which, of course, was the contention that -- important in the

8

lower court's decision,tut it was alluded to there and of

9

course was raised again before this Court on appeal, and that
i

10

is the alien's right; to travel for which position the

1!

Appellee placed great reliance on this Court’s decision in

12

Shapiro versus Thompson.

13

Mow, iii the beginning of that decision, Your

14

Honors.*'is the fact, that this Court found the right of citizens

15

to travel derived from several provisions of the constitution,

16

and from the very nature of the

17

did not, however, according to my understanding of that case,

IS

say the right was derived solely from the 14th Amendment,

19

which of course, had been conceded applies equally to, aliens,

20

©accept for the judicially created exception which we are ad­

21

vancing to this Court at this point with respect to the public

22

interest doctrine.

23

himself.

The Court

We would further point out, Your Honors, that the

24

right to enter and chide, we feel, by virtue of the decisions

25

of this Court, are not on the same footing as the citizen's
10

1

2

right to travel»
In the Truax case? for example, this Court noted

3

that the alien9s right to enter and abide stemmed from Federal

4

lav? and not from the 14th Amendment»

5

therefore, be retracted by a Federal statute»

6

And such right might,

It would seem to follow, therefore, that an

1

infringement upon this right which we would deny was brought

8

about by the statute here in question, might be invalid under

9

the Federal statute? it might be invalid by virtue of the

10

supremacy clause, but it certainly would not be invalid by-

11

virtue of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause»

12

We come, therefore, to the final-issue raised by

13

the brief, and that is whether this statute from Pennsylvania

14

is an obstruction of Federal law dealing with immigration and

13

naturalisation? or, an intent on the part of the state to

IS

regulate aliens.

17

We concade that in the decision of this Court in

18

Hines versus D&vidowitz, the state can only do this within very

19

narrow limits.

20

decision ©f this Court in the Hines case, must be construed

21

very, very strictly and within the very narrow limits.

22

Any regulations, Your Honors, under the

However, as Judge Wood appropriately noted in his

23

dissent in the lower court :

if Pennsylvania had no general

24

assistance program at all Federal laws dealing with aliens

23

would not be obstructed.

It is therefore difficult to sea
11

1

how Federal laws are any more obstructed because the state

2

decides to give welfare payments to its citizens.

3

Furthermore, insofar as attempting to regulate

4

aliens is concerned, how can a statute which grants assistance

5

to citizens be said to regulate aliens any more than a statute

6

which would grant assistance to persons over 65 can be said

7

to be regulating persons under 65?

8
0

And to take it one step further; let us assume
that the statute grants assistance to all persons over 65,

10

alien or citizen.

11

the statute as being discriminatory in violation of the 14th

12

Amendment and in violation of the supremacy clause because it

13

attempts to regulate him?

14

15
16

Can an alien then come in and challenge

We respectfully submit that to state that proposi­
tion indicates its absurdity.
Appelleres in their brief, assert that the state

17

denial of general assistance to aliens may have some effect

18

on the decision of an alien to settle in Pennsylvania, or if

19

may cause them to remove elsewhere.

20

might be said of Pennsylvania’s six percent sales tax or its

21

liquor tax, which is the second highest in the nation, or its

22

cigarette tax, which is also somewhere near the highest.

23

i

Of course, the same thing

No one, we submit, however, Your Honors, would

24

seriously contend that these statutes are invalid as an attempt

25

to regulate aliens because they might cause them to remove
12

1

elsewhere.

2

Furthermore * we would submit —

3

Q

Well you might have a little different

4

problem if the cigarette tax was imposed only if the purchaser

5

of the cigarettes were an alien that were not imposed on a

6

citisen of Pennsylvania»

7

isn’t. it?
A

8
9

That6s the analogy with this casei

It is, Your Honor# except that as I under-

stand the Appellees’ argument the test that they are trying to

10

assert to ask this Court to determine whether or not we are

11

violating the supremacy clause in regulating aliens is whether

12

or not this statute does have some effect on their decision to

13

locate elsewhere, or not to locate within the State of

14

Pennsylvania.

15

an effect on that decision.

16

And any of these tilings could certainly have

We would also submit# Your. Honors# that because

17

of the Federal statuteand the Federal schema of' intent# which

'18

isindieated by that statute and the requirement fcJaat aliens

19

entering in this country be able to demonstrate their ability to

20

earn a livelihood# we sincerely doubt that this factor was

21

given much# if any consideration at the time of entry.

22

is the fact of whether or not Pennsylvania grants assistance fcc

23

aliens or not.

M

24
25

That

And finally# Your Honors# I would point out# and
1 think it has come up in the Arisona argument: the Federal
13

1

statutes do not impose any duty on the states to provide

2

assistance to aliens.

3

categories the statute leaves it open to the states and would

4

not cause the Department of Health, Educationg and Welfare to

5

hold a stats plan invalid where it does discriminate against

6

aliens.

7

In fact, even in the Federal assistance

We would further submit in this regard that the

Q

statutory intent and scheme as set forth in the Federal

9

statutes on immigration and naturalization, particularly in

JO

8U.S.C. 1182(a) ~ 1182(a)(7), 1182(8), 1182(15), 1183 and

1?

1251, would lead one to presume that the Congressional intent

12

was to relieve both the states and the Federal Government of

13

the burden of aliens who might become public charges.

14

We submit, therefore, that it is difficult to see

15

how the State8s decision could grant an affirmative benefit

IQ

to citizens pf the United States residing in Pennsylvania con­

17

flicts with this scheme of Federal regulation of aliens»

18

We had an allegation which I think, Your Honors,

19

that I have to specifically respond to in the brief, and that

20

was that this statute, according to the Appellees9 position,

21

was enacted as a result of war hysteria.

22

I i^anted to point out to the Court that in the

23

lower court transcript which the Court has before it, there is

24

only one minute quantity of proof and this was submitted by

25

one man“s opinion in writing on the scheme of assistance in
14

1

Pennsylvania,, which said that this was enacted as a result of

2

war hysteria.

3

support that assertion.

4

©videnqe to support the charge, except the opinion ©f the one

5

author.

There is absolutely no legislative history to
There is absolutely no other credible

We submit, Your Honors, it would be just as

6
7

logical and more in keeping with the presumption that the

8

legislature has a proper motive in enacting legislation to

9

assume that .after the enactment of the Federal Social Security

10

law of 1935 and after four years of trial and error basis, the

11

states could see a vast area of persons 'who were not encom­

12

passed within the Federal statutory scheme and they enacted a

13

general assistance statute to take ear© of

14

persons»

particular

Wo would not say that they did not at that time

13

IS

have the special public interest doctrine much in mind when

17

they did not provide for aliens under that same scheme.
In summary, therefore, Your Honors, we would

18
19

submit, and we will admit that these laws which create a

20

distinction between aliens and citizens which have evolved in

21

the formulation of the special public interest rules, are

22

based upon the assumption that aliens told allegiance to foreign

23

nations„

24
25

V

We respectfully submit, however, that if the
Court is ready to say

that this distinction violates the

15

1

precept of the 14th Amendment we would also submit that this

2

Court may in the very near future be ready to say

3

of the right to vote and tine denial of the right to hold

4

public office are also rights which may not be denied to

5

aliena for the same reasons.

S

Q

Would you think — did Takahashi say ■—

7

A

Did they say that, Your Honor?

8

Q

Yes c

9

A

In the Takahashi case the Court specifi­

that denial

10

cally noted that there was such a doctrine as the special

II

public interest doctrine.
Q

12

They denied --

But do you think the provision that only

13

citizens and not aliens may be employed on public projects.

14

Do you think that kind of a rule could survive Takahashi?

15
16

23

Q

Well, Neither Crane nor Heim survived

Ho, Your Honor, for the reason that I

To the extent that a state may attempt to

A

6

So it*s no authority# even if it

Only to the extent that# Your Honor# that

7

the Crane doctrine, as I understand it, was the first real

8

enunciation of the so-called special public interest doctrine.
Q

9

10

Well, it was preceded by Heim versus

McCollum ~

11

A

Heim

versus McCollum on the —

12

Q

Heim

versus McCollum on the

13

same day.

And they both relied ©n McCready; didn9t they?

14

A

15

I agree; completely, Your Honor, that this Court

IS

has certainly by its later decisions, said that the fight to

17

earn a livelihood may not be even ~
Q

18
10

Yes,

Your Honor.

Mr. Work, do you agree that you couldn’t

prevent an alien from working in Pennsylvania?

20

A

I agree. Your Honor.

21

Q

And you agree that you couldn’t tax him

22

a certain,

23

©n him?
A

24
25

amount of money, restricted to aliens, a work tax

You mean different from other citizens, You*'

Honor?
17

No; I don’t 'think you could, because that, again,

would be attempting to regulate the right to earn a living.
Q

You couldn't put any additional tax on him

for anything; could you?
A

I believe you ar© right, Your Honor? yes.

Q

Why not?

A

Again, 1 think that the special public

interest, doctrine, if it has vitality today, as I submit that
it still does, it has been at least watered down, to use the
term, by this Court to the extent that if it involves the
right to earn a livelihood, this Court has said that is incon­
sistent with ‘the Federal rights granted to enter and. abide.
Q

So that you can't discriminate against him
\

in putting money into 'th© treasury of the state?
A

That is correct. Your Honor.

A

It. would presumably be so, Your Honor, for

the same reasons, if I may submit, that he is denied the right

to vote and that h® is denied the right to hold public office.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

We have before us today a ease of alien discrim­

earlier year in Pennsylvania.

In addition, this law which was passed in 1939

was passed within five days of the State Alien Registration

Both basically rest in a

Do you think the limitation^ the stats

places on voters and holding a public office is rooted in

11

some of the same kinds of hostility?

12

A

It may be, Your Honor, but I think the

13

voting area and this political public office area is very much

14

distinguishable from this area before the Court today.

15

the government has much wider latitude in acting to protect

16

the political processes, the governmental processes and they

17

don't have that latitude in the area which is before us today,

18

of social or economic benefits which are based upon a classi­

While

"

20

That's the teaching o£ Talc ah. as hi, which says that

21

a state is limited, is very much limited in making a classifi­

22

cation based on alienage.

I might point out in response to the Commonwealth s

argument that TakahaShi wasn't an alienage case.

Japanese and other ' groups which were affected by that pro­

4

vision,

5

to view this as a racial case, as a Japanese case? in ■ fact,

6

the option was made clear by the concurring opinion of Mr,

7

Justices Rutledge and Murphy, who perhaps would have preferred

8

to view it as an anti-Japanese case, but that's not the way

9

the majority of the Court viewed the case.

Moreover, this Court had an opportunity in Takahashi

The majority of the Court viewed the case and

10

equated alienage with color as both being impermissible bases

12

for classification both under the 14th Amendment and both

I might add that —

Mr, Stein, is your fundamental position

here on the Equal Protection Clause?

17

A

Yes, it is,

Q

If it is, why isn't it as much on a

forfeiorari, why isn't the Pennsylvania law in conflict with

20

Section 1981?

21

A

Well* wa add. Your Honor, that it is in

22

conflict both with the Equal Protection argument and those

23

statutes that have put that clause, in effect, that Section

the government, in our view, has much greater latitude in

10

What is really, I think at issue here in terms of

11

what the basis of -the Pennsylvania is is really the assumption

12

that these aliens are less deserving than citizens.

13

has been judicially recognised, both by the court below; both

14

by the Purdy Fitzpatrick California Supreme Court opinion and

Arid it

in the concurring opinion in Oyama, that aliens have contri­

history of productive contributing to the state and to the

A

My answer there is that since there is wide

12

latitude for state governments to regulate in the area of

13

political concerns that right now aliens do not have that

14

right to vote under the Equal Protection Clause.

15

IS
17

Q

Right now they 'dbn'fe have the right that

you are. arguing for as yet; do they?
A

Well, Your Honor, in fact they do in terms

18

©f hew the Equal Protection Clause has been interpreted in its

19

application to aliens.

20

stronger factual pattern than d©es the Shapiro v« Thompson

21

residency ease; in terms of whether there is a rational basis

22

for this classification.

23
24
25

This case in one sense presents a

In the residency case you had newcomers to the
state; people living in the state less than one year.

In our

case you have people who have- been in the state for many years,

25

1

who have clearly made contributions to the state and to the

2

nation.

3
4
5

Q

Yes, but at the same time haven51 they

chosen not to become; naturalised?
A

No, Your Honor? in many cases, as the

6

record shows, many resident aliens cannot become naturalised

7

simply because they can’t pass the literacy test.

8
9
10

Q

Well, then they have chosen not to become

naturalised by becoming literate.
A

Well, if that is a choice of volition, a

II

question of volition I would say that for people, at least

12

literacy is not always for 'everyone a voluntary act.

13

there are people who haven8t been literate and can’t speak

14

English or they may be quite literate in Russian or Spanish,

15

due to no fault of their own.

1G

Q

I mean

And so that aspect —

Well, take the other case where let's

17

assume could have become a citizen, was quite literate and

18

just chose not to.

19

A

What would you suggest then?
I think that’s really an irrelevant concern

20

because the Equal Protection Clause does apply to aliens,

21

irrespective to their desire to become naturalized, irrespec­

22

tive of their literacy qualifications.

23

The Pennsylvania, in a sense, is saying that they

24

are trying to save money for their own people.

25

through this citizenship bar they are, in fact, denying
26

Well, but

1

assistance to their own people, the residents of Pennsylvania.

2

And for that reason we suggest that there is no rational

3

basis to this classification»

4

The conservation of funds argument we maintain

5

also comes down to the post hac rationalisation for what has

6

amoufced to a quite casual and pointless discrimination.

7

Court below questioned the fiscal concernwhen they pointed

8

out that about 55 or 70 people each year are denied general

0

assistance in Pennsylvania# in a state where there are over

10
11

The

700,000 people on assistance.
In addition, Pennsylvania, although saying that

12

they are saving money for U. S. citizens and denying

13

aliens, is giving money to aliens in the Federal categories.

14

Q

it to

But on your arguments don't we have to

15

resolve the constitutional issues precisely as though 500,000

IS

of the 700,000 were aliens?

17

many or how £eiw aliens are- involved?

18

A

Does it make any difference how

No, It doesn't, Your Honor. It only makes

19

a difference as fe© the State's argument in suggesting a

20

rational basis in a fiscal concern.

21

where is the fiscal concern really, when merely 65 ox 70

22

people are at issue?

It's unconstitutional.

A

•

.

«

Well, it is not relevant in the abstract to
21

1

the constitutional issue but in this case where the sole

2

basis for justification resides in the conserving of state

3

funds one has to scrutinize that solution and see it for what

4

it is, which is, we suggest, a fiction in this case, because

5

there is really no fiscal, concern here.

6

which is a post hac rationalization for a discrimination made

7

30-odd years ago, when prejudiea and ill will against aliens

8

was really the motivation for this statute.

9

Q

This was an argument

But if you have in the State of Pennsylvania,

10

setting aside, let vis say arbitrarily $660 million for this

11

program and 600 of the 706,000 total eligible people were

12

aliens would that not work a hardship to the reduction of the

13

amount paid to the citizens if we accept your argument?

22

because 'that cuts equally for 0. S. citizens or for aliens and

23

Q

What is the assistance in Panama?

How

A

Well# I believe Panama gives gives social

much is it?

17
18

security benefits and hospital benefits to aliens in the

19

country.

20

Q

Well# do they give welfare benefits?

21

A

I don't think they do.

Great Britain does#

22

though# and U„ S. citizens in Great Britain are eligible for

23

supplementary benefits.

I'd like t© say in conclusion that w@ are# as
President Kennedy's book set forth; "a nation of immigrants#"

with a tradition and I guess the strengths of our history

2

reside in the fact that when immigrants have come to our

3

shores and to live among ua they have been afforded equal

4

treatment»

5

and vigilance of this Court whan such immigrants have been

6

met with ill will and prejudice when they have come to this

shore„

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH P. WORK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

16

U
18

Thank you, Mr. Stein.

MR. WORK:

Mr. Chief Justice I have nothing

further unless the Court has some specific questions.

19

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you Mr. Work.

20

Q

May I ask you one question?

21

A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

Mi at do you do with the language of the

23

14th Amendment itself, which draws a distinction in certain

24

places, between citizens and aliens?

25

A

I find nothing in the amendment itself,
37

1
2

Your Honor, which draws that distinction,
Q

You do not?

It says this: 9,All persons

3

horn or naturalized in the United States and subject to the

4

jurisdiction thereof ar© citizens of the United States and

S

p£ the state wherein they reside»

6

©nforoo any law which shall abridge the privileges or immuni­

?

ties of citizens ©f the United States, nor shall any state

No state shall make or

.

8

deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due

3

procusa o£ law,51

10

"Not deny to any person within its jurisdic­

tion the equal protection of the laws."

11

Doesn't that signify some difference?

12

A

1 think that there is some difference!

13

however, Your Honor, if 1 understood the decisions of this

14

Court correctly with respect to the Equal Protection Clause of

IS

the 14th Amendment it is ray understanding that 'this Court had

10

already said that the Equal Protection Claus® did apply to

17

aliens, as well as citizens»

18

Q

f@s.

IS

A

Right.

Well, it was under the language of it.
The only distinction -that I see,

20

Your Honor, and the only, perhaps as I stated in the beginning

21

my whole position in being here is based upon the fact that

22

there are judicially-created exceptions to the overall applica­

23

bility of the Equal Protection Clause, one of them being the

24

special public interest doctrine.

25

Q

What?
38

i

A

The special public interest doctrine.

2

Q

What do you mean by that?

2

A

That fch© state has the right in the conser­

4

vation of its assets for its own citizens to draw a distinc­

5

tion between aliens and citizens.
Q

6

7

But the amendment says in reference to any

person they shall not be denied equal protection ©f the laws»

8

A

I fully appreciate that? Your Honor.

9

Q

And grants no authority it seems, to treat

10

then differently than you are treating the other citizens of

11

the state.
A

12

I would, in all humility, say to His Honor,

13

that if I were reciting the case at this time perhaps I would

14

decide it differently, but it is my understanding of the

15

decisions of this Court that they hav© said there are judi­

IS

cially-created exceptions to that specific thing.
Q

17

As to aliens, but not as to other people

18

who are permitted to liv® there under the laws of the United

19

States.

20

A

21

Q

22
23
24
25

Fight.

But only as to aliens.

And you agree, do you not, that the Supreme

Law of the United States says they have a right to live in
Arizona like anybody else or Pennsylvania?
A

Correct.

Q

And b© treated like other people.
39

I

A

To the extent that this Court has not drawn
s

a distinction? yes.
