We will hear arguments

next in Humber 239s Cohen against California.

Mr. N armer, you Kay proceed whenever you are ready.

4
B

I might suggest to you that, as in

tost cases, the Court is

thoroughly familiar with the factual: setting of this case and

it will not be necessary for you, I am sure, to dwell on the

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MELVILLE B„ NIMMER; ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

SO
11

MR. NXMMER:

Thanh you, Your Honor.

12

Mr. Chief Juslice, and may it please the Courts

13

This case is, of course, here on appeal from a

14

judgment of the Court of Appeals, State of California, upon

15

this Court's order postponing jurisdiction pending hearing on

16

the; merits.
At Mr. Chief Justice's suggestion I certainly will

17
m

keep very brief the statement of facts, but fundamentally we
do have here the Appellant charged and convicted of engaging

20

in tumultuous and offensive

conduct in violation of the

And, although there was a reversal upon the first level

of appeal held by the Superior Court-, it was then, certified by
the Court of Appeals which vacated .ad affirmed the judgment.
The California Supreme Court refused, to hear it in a 4 to 3

i

1

decision on that»

2

And of course, fundamentally# may it please the

3

Court, what this young man did was

4

corridor in Los Angeles County on his way to a courtroom where

S

he had some business»

6
7

.

:o walk through a cpurthouse:

Q

What business did he have?

A

Mr» Justice, although it was not in the

8

record, he was called there as a witness in a case which he

9

was not involved in himself»

Then, while walking through that

10

corridor he was wearing a jacket on which we re inscribed the

'11

wordst

12

and several peace symbols»

13

Tuck the draft»”

Also inscribed were words "Stop War-,"

Mien he entered tie courtroom he took off his jacket

14

and held it folded»

15

for disturbing the peace? specifically engaging in tumultous

16

and offensive conduct»

17

18
18

Q

When he left tie courtroom he was arrested

When he took the jacket off did he put it in

a place where it was prominently on view?
A

No, Mr« Justice Stewart, he held it folded

20

over his arm and it was not on view there.

2t

policeman who observed him walking ■ ’trough the corridor before

22

he went into the courtroom — • this is in the record — request©

23

the judge in the courtroom to hold the young man in contempt»

24

The judge refused to hold the young man in contempt because

25

there was nothing to be seen in the courtroom -- I shouldn81

Furthermore, the

2

anything, but there was nothing to be seen.

3

and at that point he was arrested.

4
5

I don’t know what he would have done, if he did see.

Q

And then he left

So the conviction rests basically upon his

wearing it in the corridor of the building?

6

A

Precisely, Mr. Justice Stewart; yes»

7

Q

In.this respect it is no different, is it,

8

from what, it would be if he had beer picked up on the street ir

9

front of the building or in any other public place?

10

A

11

the point —

12

Q

The courthouse atmosphere has nothing to do

A

I think it is not an issue in this case; yes,

Q

Well, wouldn’t you think that there are some

I think that’s

with it?

14
15

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

Your Honor.

10

17

things people couldn’t do in a courtroom that they could do at

18

other places?
A

19

Mr. Justice Black, I would think there are

20

some things that in the courtroom itself while court is in

21

session, would be improper, consistent with the First Amendment.

22

I don't think that arises in this case.

23

Q

You said he did not wear this jacket in the

That is correct, Your Honor.

courtroom?

4

1

I would make the distinctions if, hypothetically,

.2

something had occurred in the courtroom while court was in

3

session, it might be a different case.

4

Your Honor.
Q

5

That, is not this case,

If he did it right at the front door of the

courtroom while the court was in session

A

Your Honor, as far as the record is con­

10

have something to say more than they would if it was — if a

13

man was walking down the street?

14

A

IS

Mr. Justice Black.. I think that when you ge.fc

into the question contempt,

IS
17

fhich that really raises, this

• Court's standard that has been adopted in numerous cases,

'

18

namely: that there* must .be a showin

19

20

process, would apply.

21

these words do appear during the session of the court, not

22

<&f.

that the speech creates a

interference with the judicial

And, conceivably, in given facts where

merely in the physical courtroom, hut while court is in

23

session, conceivably that would apply? but that is not this

24

case, with all respect, Your Honor.

25

So that this young man was arrested while walking in
5

1

the corridor# and 1 think it is vital to point out to the

&

Court that there were --

3

Q

What courthouse was this?

4

A

It was in the Los Angeles Comity Courthouse,

5

Mr. Justice Brennan.

6

Q

That5s not the very large one? is it?

7

A

It is# yes.

8

Q

Is that the one with the 1.00 courtrooms?

9

A

That is a very large one.

Something like that# Your Honor? yes.

It#

10

incidentally is not a courtroom where draft cases are tried.

11

Xt9s not the Federal Court? it!Js the State Court.

12

Well# I think it’s important at the outset to point

13

out. t© the Court that there was no violence# no component of

14

violence present.

15

signed by the trial judge that the Appellant did not engage

16

in violence# did not threaten violence; that no one observing

17

him engaged in violence or threatened violence0

18

violence component is completely out.

m

is terribly significant# for the broader significance of this

20

case# pointing out as it. do©3# as it can do# depending upon

21

this Court's decision# the vary vital distinction between dis­

It is terribly important{ we submit, Your Honors,

3

that this Court

4

by its very nature, involves the right to be offensive.

S

offensive dissent is almost.' a contradiction in terras, because;

6

if it’s nonoffensive it means that ; ou agree with it.

7

the other hand, violent dissent is : omething quite different.

Would it be your position that your client

could have had a First Amendment right to say these words

11

orally# face-to-face? to any person in the hall outside the

12

courtroom?

Mr, Justics White# I don’t think the distinc­

.

I don't offhand see a. viable distinction

between the written and the oral? yes.

3

But, Your Honor, I think itEs terribly important —

4

you are not suggesting, but it suggests to me the "fighting

5

words" concept taken from the ChapHusky case, decided by this

6

Court some years ago, where this Court suggested that in cer­

1

tain circumstances the words may be regarded as fighting words

8

because men will reasonably mow that they will result in

9

violence and hence, that those word;:’ are part of the First

1,0

Amendment.
Q

11

Is your view of fighting words different

12

than — do you think fighting words are different than insul­

13

ting words?
A

14

No, Your Honor? that's precisely my point?

IS

I think they are synonomous, arid hence these are not fighting

words because they are — well, perhaps I should be more

Mr, Chief Justicefirst of all# in terms of

11

the fighting words# X;don't see any likelihood of the facts

12

constituting those fighting words# but in any event# I -think

13

the fundamental- point is it is the burden of the state to show

14

that under given circumstances — the circumstances were such

15

that these ware fighting words? that is# given the factual

16

situation that you describe# of servicemen around and so on#

17

that it’s a factual burden on the state to show that in those

18

particular circumstances there v- , the likelihood of violence»

19

No such showing was made in this case»

20

Beyond that# perhaps I should further elucidate on
■

21

the possible distinction between oral and written.

22

tainly true that there may be some nonspeech interests that

23

arise in connection with an oral statement that may not arise

24

with a written statement.

25

. .

It is. cer­

.

For example# you spoke of enchanting; well# if there

1

were a constant oral kind oi commun: cation that became a dis­

2

turbance, then regardless oi the content of the speech that

3

might be grounds for the state moving in and stopping this«

4

So, in that sense there can. foe a distinction between oral and

5

verbal, but I don't make the distinction in terms of the in­

6

tellectual content of what is said,,
Well, the Court of Appeals, the California State

7
8

Court of Appeals, attempted to deferd the lower court5s decisio: .1

0

on the grounds that there was a possibility it might have

10

happened that there would be violence, despite the fact that

11

the settle (?) statement clearly say,: , signed by the Court

12

judge, that -there was no violence as.d no .likelihood of violence V

13

either by -the Appellant or by anyone hostile to him or with

14

him, viewing him»
And s© this was quite contrary tc -tine facts of the

15

16
17

records
Beyond that, quit*:: apart from that, the standard

18

adopted by the Court of Appeals is quite improper in view of

IS

the carefully worked out doctrine, that this Court has emm~

20

dated through the years about the First Amendment»

i

Note the possible implications, for example in casss

like Edwards versus South Carolina,

3

that thatss not enough of a standard, the mere possibility.

There must be a likelihood, a real likelihood and an imminence

in order to justify a breach in freedom of speech.

7.

record to reflect -such a standard here.

We submit, Your Honors, that there are very serious

10

and important First Amendment implications here that should foe

12

because, having passed the point anc

13

to come back if any ofthe Court wishes, on any of these various

14

exclusionary grounds why the First Amendment does not apply,

IS

assuming that none of those pertain and we submit they do not, j

18

as set forth in the whole part 1 ©f our brief, going to part 2 ;

of our brief, why is profanity itself worthy of protection?

I would certainly foe happy

Well, on© really doesn61 nave to put it in

20

you don't have to justify it on any other grounds.

First Amendment if we may, and

7

Now, what does fchis have to do with communi­

cating dialogue or discussion of public issues?

8

9

Your Honor, I understand the argument can be

made and perhaps you, by implication, are making it? why did

10

he have to use these words?

11

"I hate the draft,."and have out forth the democratic dialogue

\z

equally as well.

Why couldn't he simply have said,

13

We have a severalfold answer to that,

14

on a more superficial level, if you will, if this Appellant

15

had used the more laundered .;arm of expression, if he had said,

16

"I hate the draft," then the self-governing people, the people

17

who must make the decisions based upon freedom of speech and

18

what they hear from that freedom of speech, would be somewhat

10

less wise than they are,
Now, what do I mean by that?

20

First of all,

I mean by that that the

21

the mere fact that this young man chose to use a word which

22

many people would no doubt find disagreeable, and no question

23

of that.

Why did he take the jacket off when he

Mr, Justice Marshall, he took the jacket off j

Yes, sir.

No? I'm certainly not saying that at all.

a somewhat different question? ones wb.at his motive was in

On the other hard.

it's a different question to con­

8

clude whether or not people had to see it for any considerable

9

period of time and we would respectfully suggest that was not

10

necessary under the circumstances.

11

people momentarily probably couldn't avoid seeing it? but therej

It is true that some

{

12

was no continuing requirement at all, and that gets to this

Captive Audience Doctrine; ir was a kind of fleeting contact as

14

one has if one walks through a Hyde Park-type area where you

15

may have fleetingly offensive sounds but they are no more than
i .

16
17

fleeting.
Well, I started tc get to what — if X may — to what

18

X think is the more profound reason why this Court must recog­

19

nise that the First Amendment goes not only to offensive con­

20

tent? and certainly this Court has made clear over and over

21

again? that no matter how offensive the idea conveyed? it still

22

is protected.

23

certainly are far more offensive to many people than the word

24

before this Court in this case that appears in seven out of 10

of our brief
Certainly of fens: .veaess per se does not derogate

3

from the right to speak undor the First Amendment«

4

the question comes backs what about the form of the offense,

5

if offensiveness comes in form rather than substance»

But then

And I

S

mad© one point on that* knowing the depth of feeling* this is

7

data that the public is entitled to know is a more profound

3

point* if I may* and that is': linguists tell us that language

9

performs two functions»

10

There is the emotive content- of language and there

11

is the intellectual content of language and that, these inter­

12

sperse.; that is that intellectual content is that which carries

'13

the message per se»

The ©active content of language is that

14

which persuades»

15

a degree by emotional considerations as wall as by intellectual

16

considerations and that the emotive content is also important.

17

We are all human beings: we are all moved to

Now* we get to what the First Amendment is all

18

about* and what it is all about* of course* is competition in

19

a marketplace of ideas and what ideas are going to prevail»

20

We subscribe to the democratic faith, that the ideas that pre- j
vail for a majority are the ideas which should be followed* but!

21
'

22

in order for that system to work it's important that the State

23

not step in and try to censor either emotive content or in­

24

tellectual content because*

25

particular emotive content* it will appeal, the message will

....depending on the emotive content,
;

19

appeal to various groups of citizens and by determining what
— by censoring the emotive content , even. if not the intellec­
tual content the state is thereby enabled to a great degree to
determine what group will buy this idea? to what group this
idea will appeal, and hence, ultimately will be able to deter­
mine what ideas prevail in the competition of the market.
And so for that reason, we submit to the Court*
respectfully, that emotive contentr just as much as intellec­
tual contentp or to put another ways that the offensiveness of
form, no less than offensiveness of substance, must be pre­
served by the First Amendment if the First Amendment is to be
meaningful.
Now,.I should like to, if I may, with the Court's
permission, point out another aspect, and that has to do with
the hostile audience veto that was referred to a little bit in
the last case.

This is another element that comes into play

in this case.

The Court could reach a decision here without
.

deciding that,but we submit It would b© both proper and
desirable for the Court togat into this issue.
What that has to do with is the Court of Appeals”
decision saying there was a likelihood of violence, ..not from
those who were following, followers of the defendant here, but
from those who were hostile to what he had to say. They might
resort to violence.

And the question was posed% even if there

was such a likelihood, even a mere tendency is a sufficient

Q

Before you sit down, Mr, Kfirmer# may I ask

6

you to comment, because you haven't made one, on the Bushman

7

case in California since this one was decided?

8

A

9

Several points, if I may? Mr. Justice Blackmun:

Yes, Your Honor,

10

first of all, it's to be noted that the Bushman case, further

n

construed.by the California Supreme Court the very statute we

32

have here, that occurred after the

13

Appeals here and after the California Supreme Court refused to

14

hear our case.

15

cision by the Court of

There, the Bushman case, per Mr. Chief Justice

16

Traver, construed Section 413 and the offensive conduct.

37

that construction is somewhat ambiguous, it seems to me, be­

18

cause part of the opinion speaks of the requirement of a clear

39

and present danger that the offensive — that offensive conduct

20

will produce violence.

2!

tendency to produce violence.

22

suggested I think there is some ambiguity =.■

23

Now,

Elsewhere in the opinion it speaks of a
And so on the very issue 1 have

Beyond that, it is interesting to note that the

24

Supreme Court opinion in Bushman cites this case, Cohen, as

25

standing for the position, for the proposition that there was a
22

i

likelihood of violence here* where there is absolutely nothing

2

in the record to support that* and to the contrary, in the

3

settle statement, page 20 of the appendix

4

countering that.

5

Q

a statement directly

D© you feel that the California Court, in

6

Bushman, disapproved ofthe holding of the Court of Appeals in

7

the present ease?

8
9

A

Your Honor, 1 have to conclude that the

California Supreme Court approved the holding because they

10

cited, apparently with approval, the Cohen -case as standing

11

for -the correct propositions namely that there must

12

lihood of violence in order so justify convicting a speaker for

Then my he.tt question ins do you feel that

the Bushman construction of she statute meets Federal Constitu­

A

17

Your Honor, I think it comes a lot closer to

meeting it than does the Court of Appeals

20

all, because it is ambiguous, as I say, or. the question of

whether on the one hand there must be a clear and present danger

of violence arising from the words which constitute offensive

conduct, or whether there would merely

in this

I would still suggest, with respect, Your'Honor, that it

I

The second point is that the California Supreme

2

Courts, in Bushman* in no way goes into this hostile audience

3

doctrine * indicating that the statu..:® would not apply if the

4

likel.ife.ood of violence arises from a hostile audience.

5

indeed, the California Supreme Court in People versus Davis,

6

which is cited in our colleague's brief, took, the contrary

7

positioni not on this same statute, but oa a anti-riot, statute,

8

saying that even if the danger comes from a hostile audience

9

that's still enough to abridge the speech.

50

1!

14

And*

So, the suggestion is' that the California Supreme
Court does not recognize that doctrine.
Q

Then you \ ould see no point in our remanding

this case for reconsideration in the light of Bushman?
A

I certainly do not, Your Honor.

First of

all, of course it would go Lack to the Court of Appeals and

16

the Court of Appeals would look at the Bushman opinion and see

I agree that, conversation is important

believe this type of language has to be subjected upon an
unwilling public.

I think : n the past wehave seen candidates

for public office who have been subjected to offensive signs,
language being yelled at them? things that at the moment are
not accepted by all the public.
I don't believe this is the same as an individual
in Edwards or some of the sit-in cages

from the south: the

fact that some white individuals may have objected to the fact

37

'I

that these people were peacefully protesting, because there is

a

no showing that they displayed such signs *

freedom songs and engaged in conduct like that, but in this

case the man has displayed a sign that the State of Califor­

We believe that this is verbal communication that
is not permitted.

Again I

/Quid gc. back to the Chaplinsky

case where it's no showing that Major Brownly who was yellec
at, was going to react to these words in any way.

The man

yelled to him and this Court approved the- words "offensive
conduct” in relation to the lower court decision.
Q

Mr. Sauer, let me see if I understand your

comment about Bushman.

You feel that the: California Supreme

Court in Bushman approved what was said in Cohen in characteri­
zation of the statute under consideration?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

I believe that

would be the only way; one in the fact that the California

:

1

Supreme Court denied a., hearing in Cohen? and two by the fact

2

they cited with approval what offensive conduct is.

3
4

Q

Nothing Inconsistent in the two opinions,

in your judgment?
A

5

No? going into offensive is something that

6

is likely or would tend to cause others to violence or if the

7

individual actually engaged in violent conduct on his own.

8

don’t believe there is any discrepancy between the two court

9

opinions.

I

Because, the very same court# the same seven

10

justices who ruled in Bushman unanimously were the same seven#

11

by 4 to 3 who denied a hearing in Cohen.

1£

they —-oaev of the dissenter i in Cohan# Chief Justice Trainer#

IS

retired Chief Justice Trainer, wrote the opinion in Bushman,

14

so I would have to as surae that they are then approving of

15

Cohen.

16

And by the fact that

We would just repeat, as I cited in our brief, in

17

going back to Chaplinsky: it has b an well-urged, paraphrasing

18

that, that words of this type are no"essential part of any.

'19

exposition of ideas and — cite social value as to the — *

20

step to the truth, that any benefit that may be derived from

21

them is clearly outweighed by the social interests in order

We believe the conviction of the Californici
Court of Appeals is valid and that the judgment should stand.

MR. NIMMER:

Thank you very much, Your ffotor.

I would like to make a few comments simply about, f

taking off on what Mr. Sauer said about the number of arrests j

I

that have occurred.

Actually, to look at the amicus brief of I

j

the ACLU of Northern California in this case, there is the

12

suggestion that there are numerous arrests all over the coun­
try all the time for this kind of offense, and particularly

Now, sometimes It may be fighting words, but not.
Sometimes, that is, it may be a preliminary to

violence, but even if it’s not, this kind of thing occurs.
And that gets to what the final point is that the
final point made by the ACLU amicus brief: of Northern Califor­
nia where they suggest that this Court may decide this case on
very narrow grounds and of course we agree on the narrow
grounds suggested by them, and I won't repeat them' because of
the lack of time.
But, may I close, Your Honors, with the suggestion

40

1

that if this case is decided for our side on narrow grounds
what it will mean that it '-/ill continue to be the fact that

3

hundreds of thousands of people all over the country are

4

arrested because they simply have used s word that others

3

find offensive in the profanity area where there is no

6

likelihood of violence»
We suggest. Your Honors, that just as the basic

7

8

underlying theory of the doctrine of overbreadth, in order to

9

avoid a chilling effect you will decide the case, even though

10

you could decide it more narrowly, in order to avoid the

IS

chilling effect on those not before the Court that it would be

12

particularly appropriate for this Court in its decision, if it

does decide that there shot.Id be a reversal, to go further and
make clear that the language of profanity is not outside the
scope of the First Amendment simply because it’s offensive»
It may be outside in given circumstances where it is a pre­
liminary to violence or where there are other specific other
grounds»

But simply because it's offensives it should be made

clear this is within the First Amendment.
And one other point, final point on the hostile
audience doctrine.

Again,

;© make clear to college students

that there is a distinction between engaging in dissent in
such a way that you don't like it and engaging in dissent as
to put down the speaker.

T.aat, toe,, is outside the bounds of

the First Amendment and this Court should make that clear.
