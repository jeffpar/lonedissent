ARGUMENT OF WILL R. WILSON, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

1

MR, WILSON:

May it please the Court, this is a re-

8

argument or second argument of this case and therefore I am

9

going to assume that the Court is somewhat familiar with the

10

case and point out that it involves a criminal conviction for

i!

the sale of heroin,

12

application of the Fourth Amendment to the investigatory pro­

13

cess, which was an overhearing by radio without a warrant.

14

the principal low point centered in the

There are other issues.

The first issue that the

15

defendant stresses is whether the informant who made the pur­

IS

chase gave his consent to being equipped or wired with a radio

17

for the purpose of transmitting the interview.

18

The second issue is whether there were in this in­

19

vestigatory process search and seizures which required a

20

warrant where no warrant was issued and therefore qo to the

21

admissibility of the evidence contained.

22

The third issue concerns the trial procedure where

23

the informant or purchaser did not himself testify and the

24

case was made exclusively from the testimony of the investi­

25

gatory agents who observed the transaction.
2

1
2

The fourth issue is the retroactivity of the Katz
case under Desist.

Now*

or the purchaser or agent,

5

the whole course of conduct establishes an overwhelming basis

8

for the consent of the informant to have a radio placed on him

7

and to go through with the transaction.

And then that conversation is carried outside

In this situation most of the interviews oc­

curred in the home of the agent and the -- of the informant,

19

and two of the government agents were stationed across the

street.

I believe it was either a car or another room

or something.

It was across the street from where the thing

occurred Wow, going to the consent of the informant, to follow

3

the procedure, he met agents at one place where they searched

nearly all of these informants are themselves addicts that are

of the Kitchen and the other two were across the street.

12

one of the government agents hid in a closet

There -were four such meetings over the period of

13

roughly thirty days, in addition to a telephone conversation

14

that was overheard, and two conversations in a car and one in

13

a restaurant, some eight or nine transactions over a period of

18

thirty days, and our position is that any objective view of

17

this course of conduct would establish without question that

18

the informant did consent to the procedure and did cooperate

19

with it in the sense that consent is an element in a consentual

20

overhearing.

2!

The informantes name was E&rvey Jackson.

He called

22

him on the telephone.

In addition to that, he tooK the delivery

23

of several deliveries of heroin which he in turn turned over

24

to the government agents, and he collected from the government

25

agents $1,000, $1,350 and $1,300, which he in turn paid over
4

1

at one time or another for the purchase of narcotics.

z

We say that this whole course of conduct establishes

3

that the informant„ Harvey Jackson, did consent in a sense

4

that is material to the Fourth Amendment issue.

5

The defendant, in some of his arguments, attacks or

6

raises questions about the motivation of the informant for con­

7

senting, and we say that that is wholly immaterial as to why

8

he did it.

9

Now, going to the analysis of the facts, the law

10

point centers around the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment

II

questions, and I want to give you -- to take a set of facts, a

12

typical set of facts and go through them and analyse them

13

against the contentions of those amendments.
Harvey Jackson met three government agents at 57th

14
15

and Outer Drive, where they searched him, installed the radio,

16

gave him the money and the group together went to Harvey

17

Jackson6s home.

18

with the door cracked open where he could see and hear the

19

transaction that was about to take place.

20

across the street.

One of the government agents hid in a closet

Two of them went

Then the defendant got up and left.

And. after that,

Jackson turned the narcotics over to the government agent who

Mow, there is no Fifth Amendment problem in this

4

because this was the event, this was the crime itself, and

5

there is no confession or admission involved,

6

that came from the lips of the defendant referring to past

7

events, and so there can't be a question of him

3

against himself in this question, because in none of the proof

9

involved the introduction of any statements by the defendant

there is nothing

testifying

10

with reference to a past event.

All of them are to a current

n

event which is a commercial transaction of the crime itself.

12

There is no Sixth Amendment question involved in

13

this because he was not under arrest at any time any of the

14

statements were made.

15

arrest that was introduced in evidence, and so there is no

?S

question about him being entitled to counsel or to be furnished

17

counsel or anything like that.

18

There was nothing he said after

So the only constitutional question, as I see it,

19

that could be involved are the questions of the Fourth Amend­

20

ment and that is was this an unreasonable search and seizure

and he shut the door.

17

Q

Yes.

18

Now, I feel like the Katz case is not in point

Those are the four.

take anybody in the phone booth with him, did he?

Well, the essential difference is Katz is not

let's come to the telephone conversation where

18

the Court will recall Jackson,

19

to the telephone and called the defendant White for the pur­

20

pose of making a date to pay some money, and he took vifch him

21

a government agent who went into the phone booth with him and

22

listened by holding his ear up close to the telephone and he

23

listened to Jackson's end of the conversation,, with the con­

24

sent of Jackson.

25

Now,

the government informant, went

that gets closer to a Fourth Amendment problem.

in my judgment, than anything else in the case at this junc-

ture.

3

Rathbun case, which you remember is the telephone extension

4

case, where the man was listening on an extension of the

5

telephone instead of listening to the very telephone itself,

6

it will tell that that was not a warrant situation.

7

see here little difference in this case and the Rathbun case.

3
9

But again,

it is a consent case, and if you take the

And we

Again I point out that what the agent listened to
was not an admission or confession and so there is no Fifth

59

or Sixth Amendment,

only a Fourth Amendment problem, and it

ti

was not a wiretap,

vz

was invited by one party to the conversation.

and it was not an unvited ear because he

1.3

And we see really no difference between, when you

14

get to looking at it, between that incident in the telephone

13

booth and the incident of the radio.

16

SJow,

there was a car,

I believe, or two cars, and I

17

think they are substantially the same situation as the others.

18

The next is defendant White's home, where the agent went by

19

himself but equipped with a radio where government officers

20

could listen to the conversation in defendant White’s home but,

2!

again, we say that the Lewis case squarely holds that there is

22

no invasion of the privacy of the home when defendant con­

23

verts his home to commercial use by selling narcotics.

That

24

is the square holding of the Lewis case; and, secondly,

you

23

have got the consent element as far as electronics are concerned.
13

!

And the Lope-2 case supports a consentual recording,

2

and I see really no difference between a consentual recording

3

and a consentual radio which broadcasts somebody to somebody

4

else over here to record.

S

So,

in summation of this point, we say there was no

6

violation of the confidential relationship to which the Fourth

7

Amendment could attach, and there was no violation of a pro­

Q

tected place to which a Fourth Amendment could attach in all of

9

these situations.

Oh, well,

Why is all of this relevant at all?

Why is not
