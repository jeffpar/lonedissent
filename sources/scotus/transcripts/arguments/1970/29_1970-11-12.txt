ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE W* SULLIVAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SULLIVAN'S

1!

Mr. Chief Jusice, and may it please

12

the Courts

in this case -the Petitioner, a steamship operator,

13

has sought to review a decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of

14

Appeals, a divided decision which reversed the U. S. District

15

Court in the City of Baltimore.

16

The case involves in essence, whether the grievance

17

and arbitration procedures in the collective bargaining agree­

24
25

ment that were negotiated by the National Maritime Union, with
the steamship employer will be the basis upon which the disputes
that have arisen and have referred to in this case will be
resolved.
The initial cause of action as stated by the
Respondent in the District Court sought to recover, firstly, a
transportation differential between first class and second class
transportation.

That was resolved before the case ever got to
2

1

its final posture in the District Court.
The next item in his claim involves certain over­

2
3

time earnings that he said he was entitled to, but had not been

4

paid and these were disputed by the master of the vessel at the

5

time he signed all articles in the Port of Saigon,
The 'third issue involves alleged penalties to which

6

7

he refers as his source of entitlements 46 U.S.C.A. Section

Now, to see this case more or less in posture I would

10

like tor ©view briefly the facts,

n

Merchant SEasnan, was engaged in the Port of Galveston, Texas on

12

August 3, 1955 to serve as an Ordinary Seaman aboard the

13

S.S.UoS, PECOS,

14

vessel, despite the U. S, in the title.

15
16

17

Mr, Arguelies, an American

This is a merchant vessel; this is not a Navy

He served aboard the vessel and at a time when the
six months which was the period of the articles he signed as
part of his engagement, expired on February 3, 1966,the vessel

18

was entering at anchor, anchorage off from Cape St. John, which

19

is just off the coast of South Vietnam,

20

to go to Saigon and discharge cargo which was in the ship.

The vessel was destined

21

22

24
25

The local authorities denied — they didn't deny;
they just didn't grant it; as a factual matter the vessel
couldn't go up the river to the port of discharge and everyone
was required to stay on the vessel until practique was granted.
This is a form of clearance to establish, that the crew is
3

3

healty, meets the quarantine requirements and

what have you.

On February 13 th, practique was granted and the

2
3

vessel proceeded up the river to Saigon, a trip of some seven

4

hours.

5

on the 17th the Respondent, in company of seven other men, asked

6

to be signed off articles.

Consul who was acting in that port in the capacity of Shipping

8

Commissioner, which is customary in foreign ports when a seaman

9

leaves a ship.

Thereafter, on the 15th the cargo was discharged and

They were referred to the U„ S.

The men were given a payroll voucher, which outlined

11

the earnings, the base wages and overtime which was certified

12

by the Consul and the men were given transportation to return

13

to the United States.

A dispute arose at that time? the men
Because of the situation in

South Vietnam and the currency situation, U„ S. currency was
not given to the men.

They were allowed $50 to use for expenses

incidental, perhaps, to their travel home.
Because of the dispute that arose the men —
Respondents, missed, the plane.

They left the next day, and

based on the testimony of the Respondent in his pretrial deposi­
tion, he arrived in Galveston on or about the 19th of February.
For reasons of his own convenience, 1 assume, he
didn't report to the company agent until the 22nd of February,
when he was given cash as certified to in the voucher.

It was

his claim that this was wrong; he should have been paid off

wages was likewise a

Further, he was claiming because the 11 days when

•3

7

practique had not been granted at the anchorage at Cape Sfc. John

&

that he was unjustifiably restricted to the ship and was en­

9

titled to additional 11 days of overtime, eight hours a day, as

10
11

a penalty.
It gets somewhat confusing in analyzing the claims

12

for penalty because it appears that at one point in "the com­

13

plaint filed in the District Court there is a claim for double

14

a day's pay as provided for in Section 596 as a penalty on top

19

20
21

25

of the penalty of overtime not paid — rather claim for restric­
tion to the ship but not paid.
Now, our position, in essence, is this; that all of
the claims that have been presented here are based on the terms
and provisions ofthe ©collective bargaining agreement and in the
collective bargaining agreement there is a procedure for presen­
ting grievances, a procedure for arbitration and it has been the
position of the Petitioner that at least in idle first instance,
based on the decisions of this Court, he is required to pursue
those procedures to get the remedy available, if he is entitled,
rather than going to cotart and start a lawsuit.

Well, is there an "all disputes" clause in the

contract or just something limited to the interpretations of the

contract?
A

It is limited to the interpretation of the

about statutory penalties.

If the employer owed you overtime and was late

A

Yes; double day’s pay, but —

Q

All right; that’s something that -- let’s assum a

that that’s all that’s left over in the dispute between the
parties.

It has nothing to do with the collective bargaining

agreement.
A

Well, we first have to determine the overtime

is due and owing.
S

!

Q

No; the employer agrees; ha’s paid it already.

Then there would be no basis for penalty

As

opposed to the facts of this particular case* because we don’t

9

concede there was a delay in this case»
Q

10
11

Well* you jmean your arbitration should then

consider only the amount of the overtime?

12

A

Yes* Your Honor.

13

Q

1 thought there was an "all disputes'’ clause

14

to this contract.,
A

15
16

this.

19

20
21

Perhaps we are differing on terminology.
"In case a disputa arises over the interpretation ot

17

18

If I may read from Article 12 which covers

any of the provisions of this agreement, whetherthe said dispute
originates on board ship or on shore, the union agrees to take
the matter up with the company and make every effort to adjust
said dispute.
"Inthe even that no —- " and so forth.

22

This would pretty much be resolved through the
23
disputes arising under the terms and provisions of the contract
24
itself.
25

Q

What kind of disputes'arise that would not be

covered under that clause.

A

If? in -the context of v?ages? if the earned

wages admittedly due to a man were not paid I don8t believe the

8

contract would then be able to be resolved»

9

to go to court and sue? but the big question is determining

You would then have

under the contract, and that's what I think are the basic issues

in this case? whether anything is due in the first instance.

arbitrarily refuses to pay it? I think the man has a cause under
596? because the contract doesn't go that far.
But? before you can even get to anything like that?
of arbitrary nonpayment one has to first determine that some­
thing is due? and this has not been done and that's where I
believe it's very important the grievance procedure be pursued.
I think in the decisions of-this court in cases —
Q

Then your position? Mr. Sullivan? is that the

collective bargaining agreement provides pro tanto? anyway? a
barrier to bringing suit under this statute?
A

Until the disputes are resolved one way or the

other and if it is assumed that if they are resolved in favor
of the seaman the wages would be paid? there wouldn't be any need
8

1

for the penalty in that instance.
Q

2

Then, I take it you are conceding Mr. Justice

3

White’s hypothetical situation, where there was overtime and

4

its payment was delayed,, but it eventually was paid and then we

5

have a question of the availability to him of the statutory

6

penalties?

7

A

1 believe the decisions have held* Mr. Justice

8

Blackmun, that overtime

all wages are earnings within the

context of the statute, so there wouldn’t be any distinction
10

between -the base wage and the overtime rata.

11

mined that the overtime earnings are due, if they are arbitrarily

12

withheld beyond the period provided in the statute the penal™

13

ties might very well be justified, unless again, we get back

14

to another aspect of Section 5 6; sufficient cause,, if it can

15

be shown there was sufficient cause for the nonpayment of the

16

1
20

22
23
24
25

Once it is deter­

monies due. Then, of course, the penalties have

not been

applied in most instances.
This Court in Johnson versus Isbrandtsen determined
a case which doesn’t quite touch the facts of this case that we
are reviewing here, determined that there was sufficient cause
arid even though th@r@ was a delay in the payment because of
wrongful withholding of certain funds out of earned wages.
Q

Well, isn’t there a strong policy reasoning

underlying the statutory penalty?
A

I think it —
S

In terms of protecting a seaman who doesn51

Q

1
2

carry much of a reserve as a businessman does; isn't that part

3

of the statutory scheme?
A

4

I think that purpose, where money is due is to

5

prevent the employer from being arbitrary and capricious and

6

not paying money conceded to be due to the roan.
Q

1
8

Well, really isn't it broader than that, that

it prevents the employer from delay in payment of the money due?

9

A

Well, when you come to the --

10

Q

It doesn't make any difference whether

11

it's

arbitrary or capricious under the statute? does it?
A

12

No; but there may be sufficient cause.

If that

13

is resolved then we come to another problem or there could be

14

a problem.

But, what has bean claimed here, these overtimes and

describe, create ■—rights that were created by the terms and
provisions of the collective bargaining agreement themselves;
therefore, if there is a dispute, we submit it should be re­
solved on the basis of the grievance procedure and the arbitra­
tion procedure in this contract.,
Q

Well, do you envision that the grievance pro-

cedure itself, if it's found that this overtime was due and
further held

it further was determined that they were withhel I

without sufficient cause that the grievance procedure itself
could take cognisance of the statute and give double pay?
10

A

1

I don’t find

anything in the agreements that

2

would provide that.

The agreement merely provides that the

3

resolution of the dispute would lead to the payment.

4

would refer the matter to the company for payment.

The union

You see, as a practical matter,what happens when

5
6

these ships pay off at the end of a voyage, you usually have a

7

union patrolman aboard and the individual crew member that has a

8

being allowed.

10

head«

The union patrolman will talk to the department

In one instance, the chief mate or the chief engineer or

12

tiie chief steward and they will endeavor to resolve it there.

22

If this can't be done it will be referred to the contracting

officer or contract, enforcement officer at the union's headquarters and it will endeavor to resolve that between the con­
tract enforcement officer and the company representative in the
company office.

And it usually would be done.

If not, then

it would go on to arbitration and the arbitration will find.
Q

So, in the lower court, both the majority and

the dissent, as I read it, agreed that in order to bring your
position or the grievant5s position into play the rights asserted
by the seaman had to have their source in the collective bar­
gaining agreement.

At least that's the way I read it.

And what I want to ask you is whether the different
facets of this man's claim can be traced to eit sr the collective
bargaining agreement itself or the articles under

3

Q

You can do that?

9

A

I endeavor to do so, both

in my

brief and in

10

outlining those sections in a single appendix we have referred

11

to them.

12

Q

And the articles have no relevance?

13

A

The articles containing thestatutory

forth Title 46 U.S.C.A. 596.

However, the conditions under

which he worked on the vessel, the nature of overtime which is
not covered in the articles, is determined in accordance with the
agreement.

And the restriction to ship which he is talking abou :

for those 11 days when practique was not granted off of Cape St.
Jagues, would be something that has ceded5 a right given to him
by the contract, and not by the articles.
Q

I suppose the only reason he would be entitled

to overtime, any overtime pay at all is because of the GOU.eetiv<i
bargaining agreement.
A

Yes, Your Honor? this is true and this is our

12

1

position and in reading the decisions in this Court it appears

2

that -the Court has gone to great lengths to give the collective

3

bargaining agreement the force almost of law,

4

phrases "the common law of the contract/’ and the "code of the

5

industry" and there we have this maritime industry that operates

0

many, many vessels.

1

unions as well as a number of companies and a number of manage­

8

ment organisations and have endeavored to set up a practical

9

basis on which to keep the vessels operating smoothly and to

10

determine the rights of the union memberse especially in this

11

overtime and perhaps restriction to ship area where overtime

12

would be involved? and provide a uniform, expeditious basis for

13

resolving these claims.

Now, if you go to litigation and you come into the
U,, S„ District Court every time a man says, "Well, the chief
office didn’t allow my overtime/’ you will have a lot of raises?
you will also have a lack of uniformity and resolution because
the men in the union and in the company offices are very
familiar with the ship’s operations and the conditions under
which these claims may arise.
Q

Mr. Sullivan, did I detect in this record a

reference of this man to the union’s agent in Japan?
A

Yes, you did.

Q

Is this action of itself indicative of the

desirability of such a statute?
13

1

A

Mr. Argue lies , the Respondent in this case,,

2

returned to Galveston, which was his port of sign-on.

3

understand his testimony in the pretrial deposition, ordinarily

4

he shipped out of Balitmore*

S

in Galveston, I think the first problem there is to

6

question of the restriction to ship and whether it was justi­

7

fied and the best man to determine "this or to give information

8

on the positions in Saigon and that this anchorage where the

9

ship was held, would be the port agent in Yokohama.

10

If I

And in going to the union agent
the

Now, in writing to him he would get, perhaps an

n

authoritative expression on whether the restriction of ship was

12

infact, a condition in that area and whether the basis of his

'33

claim that he is entitled to eight hours a day overtime for fhos

14

11 days when he couldn't get off the ship, is justified.

15

idea of him writing to the agent would allow an opportunity for

16

the reply from Japan to come back to Mr. Arguelles in Baltimore,

17

18

19
20
21

23
24
25

The

since he was not living in Galveston and not regularly shipping
out of Galveston made his base of operations in Baltimore.
And in any event, under that Article II, Section 2
of the collective bargaining agreement, if he was dissatisfied
with that advice it says as you read down, that he was entitled
to a further matter to the head office of the union, if he
didn’t want to follow the advice of the agent in halvas tOR-*
which apparently he didn’t do, but he wouldn’t do anything else.
He went back to Baltimore? he engaged counsel and
14

1

ultimately brought this lawsuit, which gave rise to the probieras

2

we have here.

3

Mow, again I go back to the decisions of this Court

4

in similar problems in other industries and it seems, in follow­

3

ing the provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act of

6

1947, Section 301(a) that it is desirable to have these things

7

resolved between the company and the union in accordance with

3

their contract.

9

the Fourth Circuit more than anything else is the time-honored

10

concept that a seaman is a ward of the Admiralty and therefore,

It

a person to be protected.

12

And.X think perhaps one thing that disturbed

But, in these instances you have on the one side a

13

very powerful union; you have a very effective labor-management

14

relations system working in the maritime industry and it seems

15

that at least to make an exception in this type situation, to

16

let the parties to the agreement endeavor to work tills out and

17
13
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

I think they are best qualified to do so.
Now, as in the Maddox case and the Baca versus
Sipes case, a decision of this Court, it was suggested that the
effort be made to resolve in accordance t© grievance procedures
before the litigation would be resorted to, and perhaps that is
what you had in mind, Mr. Justice Blackmun: did he get fair
treatment, adequate treatment at the hands of his union?
1 think that he did here.
really a chance to take the matter up.

15

He didn't give the union
1 think he just dropped

1

it when they said "Write to Yokohama."

He didn’t take it any

2

further and I think he should have.

3

counsel? and counsel has certainly been qualified to take 'the

4

matter up for him with the union and that wasn't done? instead?

5

they started the lawsuit.

Ha eventually engaged

And really? in granting summary judgment of the

6
7

District Court? I think the District Court Judge reached the

8

conclusion that there was really no dispute on this point? that

9

he didn't pursue grievance and arbitration procedures.

10

That's

why the summary judgment was justified.
Now? today? again with the shipping .industry

11
12

operating all over the world and men leaving ships occasionally

13

in foreign ports? I think uniform procedures are most important

14

and we should have a system on which everyone may .rely and

15

expect to have a certain amount of predictability in the results

16

This is why it becomes important? I believe? to follow the

17
13

grievance procedure and the arbitration procedure set up in the
agreement.

This is what they wanted to do and this is what

19

would best serve the needs of the Indusfry generally.

Mr. Avnefc.

Mr. Chief Jusice„ and may it please the

n

Court;

13

befo.ro I go into the argument.

I would like just to cite a few additional facts here

I would like to point out that the statute provides

14
15

that in the foreign voyage

16

off in 24 hours after the cargo is discharged? or in four days

17

the seaman is entitled to be paid

after he is discharged? and for not doing so, the ship is liable

13

for two days pay for each day of delay.

19

should be recoverable, "as wages in any claim made before the

20

court."

21

22
23
24
25

And that the wages

Then there is another Section 597 which provides
that where a seaman asks for a draw at any port he must be paid
a portion of his wages due; a third? otherwise the whole amount
becomes due and he is entitled to be discharged.
Now, in this case Mr. Arguelles, the seaman, went
17

1

first to Saigon during the six month period of these shipping

2

articles and then went back to Taiwan to take on another cargo

3

and the six months was about to expire and one day before the

4

six months8 period, on February 2 of 1966, Mr. Arguelles asked

5

the captain to be discharged.

S

said, "I’d like my draw," and the captain said "no."

7

between the lines it is obvious here the captain did not wish

8

to lose Mr. Arguelles and he intended to keep him beyond the

9

six months period of his articles, knowing that by the time the

The captain said* "No."

And he
Reading

10

ship got to Saigon or near Saigon, that the six months would

11

have expired and he would still have the services of Mr.

12

Arguelles, even though Mr. Arguelles no longer wanted to serve

13

beyond -the six months'period.

14

Well, I point out it’s not a case of a man who

15

didn'twant to go to Saigon, the thing he agreed, to do? he had

16

already been there, but because the articles were about to ex­

17
18
19
20
21

22

24
25

pire he wanted to get off the ship and get paid.

Then the

vessel arrived in Cape St. Jacques, which was on the 3rd, the
day the articles expired, he again asked to be discharged and
be paid off and again he was refused.
Now, assuming that the ship was not granted clearances; that is that the crew was not granted shore leave.

There

was no objection, apparently, to the agent coming aboard with
an American Consul, if necessary, so that the men who wanted to
get paid off whose articles had expired, could be paid off, but
18

1

the captain didn1t want that.

2

lines, he wanted to keep that crew on the ship and maybe it

3

was because he couldn’t get replacements or it was difficult to

4

get replacements.

5

articles so far as Mr. Arguelles was concerned, because he was

8

there only on sir month® articles and they were forcibly keeping

7

him there beyond that.

But be that as it may, this violated the

at

Cape St. Jacques for a period of some ten or eleven days and.

10

finally the ship was moved up the river toward the Port of

11

Saigon.

12

Q

May I ask you this —

13

A

Yes, sir.

U

Q

If the six months 0 expiration date comes at

15

a time they are in a foreign port, does the seaman have a right

16

to iinsist upon —* the articles until he's at his home port or

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

can the master of the vessel terminate him then and there?
A

The procedure, Your Honor, is to decide — for

the man to decide whether he wants to continue on and then he
resigns his articles or if he decides he doesn't want to continue on then he's paid off right there and the captain replaces
him with someone else.
Q

Suppose he wants to stay on but the captain

wants to terminate him.

My question is s may he be terminated in

a foreign port?
19

A

1
2

it6s only for six months.
Q

3
4

X would think so; because the article says

Suppose the six months 1 period ends when the

ship's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
A

5

Wall,, of course, as a practical measure, he

6

would be continued on until the next port and he would be paid

7

off at that next port.
Well, when the vessel arrived then in Saigon, and

8
9

this is on the 13th of February, again he asked to be dis­

10

charged and be put off and again .he was refused, it being the

11

obvious intention of the captain to keep him aboard there

12

regardless of

articles and regardless of what his wishes

Finally, it was on the 17th that Mr. Arguelles was
finally permitted to leave the ship and then, instead of being
paid in American dollars, as the law requires, he was paid by
simply a voucher and given $50 and the answer was given, not
there, but here, later on, that- there not cash enough to do it.
Now, there is no proof that there was any law that
barred the payment of American dollars in Saigon? there was no
proof in the record at all.

On the contrary, Mr. Arguelles

testified, and that's the only testimony we have here, direct
testimony, that he thought he was entitled to be paid off there,
and this prompted an argument between him and the .American
Consul and some of the other seamen who wished to be paid off.
20

1

Then they flew him to the states and there he had to

2

wait for approximately three days before the company decided to

3

pay him off.

11

•this is a futile thing for him to do? he couldn't negotiate

12

Now, the grievance contract says, "Must be settled

charge? here being Houston.

Or the American Continental Port,

which would have been also Houston.
Now, this is wtee it should have been settled and
it wasn't settled here and it was for the union to take it up,
not this man, because this man wasn't getting any relief from
•the union and therefore he came to me and after I wrote to the
company to try to get them to pay the man they refused and I
finally took it to.court.
“21

Now, these are the facts in the case, may it please
the Court.
Q

1 think that you are emphasizing these facts

4

on 'the theory that this is the kind of recalcitrance that the

5

statute was intended to penalize.

6

A

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

And, to answer now, Justice Stewart's questionz it

8

is true that the amounts of the overtime — or rate of the

9

overtime, is fixed by the collective bargaining contract, but

10

the remedy, Your Honor, is given by the statute and this is —

In other words the pay remedies

out that precisely to overcome an abusa such as has occurred

guaranteed by ‘that statute. Of course that statute is in the

interests of making and building a strong Merchant Marine for
the defense of the country and for a solid mercantile develop­
ment in our country with regard to the Merchant Marine as was
22

1

indicated by this court in a decision written by this Court

2

fairly recently, which 1 cite in my brief.

3

Q

How long has this statute bean on the books?

4

A

The statute originated, Mr. Justice, about

3

i‘/5k and there it was amended about IS 15, in its present form,

3

and -this has teen the policy ■— -this statists is based, of course

7

upon policy, t© have a strong Merchant Marine dating from —

8

back to the date of the Revolution.

9

""

I would like to point out now at this point .that Mr.

10

Sullivan, my opponent, is arguing -that there's no lead now for

11

this type of statute because American seamen are much better off

12

than they were a century ago.

13

are better off now and that that is due to the collective bar­

14

gaining machinery; however, it is not as good a situation as

15

counsel x-rould have you believe.

16
17
18

20
21

22

25

I won't argue with him that they

Today, the passenger vessel trade, that is American
passenger vessel trade is very much off.

These people are

having difficult times, which means than that seamen may be
subjected to delay in payment of their wages or nonpayment.

We

have a number of marginal shippers in the Merchant Marine to­
day, people owning one ship or two ships who are making their
profit through trade iri the Saigon run.

Now, with the unwinding

of that war and the end of that war, obviously these small
companies are going to be in financial straits and these seamen
then will suffer as a consequence, because there will be a

23

1

delay in payment and which will mean no payment at all*

2

eventually.

3

And so it is important to have this two'-for-one

4

specter facing the ship owner or ship operator so he will know

5

that fchos© wages must be paid promptly in order to encourage

6

these men to go to sea.

7

We're having a number of mergers today and people

8

don't know who their employer is and in these instances there

9

are delays and nonpayment of wages compelling the men to go to

10

11

court under this statute.
Q

Do you think that the grievance procedure it­

12

self* could take account of the statute and give the man what

13

the statute gives him? that is; double pay for any wages wrong­

14

fully withhold?

A one-hundred percent penalty for each day -that

13

it was wrongfully withheld and that that could be done bythe

16

grievance machinery and that would give your clients and others

21

22
23
24
25

similarly situation much fastor relief because* generally speak­
ing, a grievance procedure works faster than a Federal Court
case; doesn't it?
A

Well* in the first place* Mr. Justice* I

don't think that the grievance machinery would necessarily work
any faster because in this particular industry where you have
the personna commodus involved* being out at sea* whether it be
on the company’s side or the workmen's side* these cases are
long in the handling.

Now, until you get the parties together;
24

f

until they can be heard, particularly an arbitration case, it

2

takes a long time.

3

in the industry,
Q

4

5

There is considerable grumbling about this

Welly it couldn't go any

faster in a Federal

Court, could it?
A

6

Welly it is3 Your Honorf because they don't go

7

this long or this far? they don't come up to the United States

3

Supreme Court.
Q

9

They usually terminate in the District Court.
Welly if a man's in Japan he can hardly be a

10

witness in the Federal District Court in Baltimore, either, any­

11

more than he can be in these grievances.
A

12

13

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But usually they end up in the

District Court and do not go up on appeal.
To answer your other question, Mr. Justice * it is

14
15

That's correct.

true that an arbitrator could do that, that is, impose the
penalty of two-for-one, but I have never seen it. done and it is
very unlikely -that the arbitrator would do that.

There is

nothing in -the grievance procedure that would require them to
do that.
Q

Suppose he didn't take account of it, what

you're talking about.
A

You mean the arbitrator?

Q

Yes.

A

If he didn't -- you mean recognise -the grie­

vance of the seaman and didn't decide in. his favor?
25

1

Q

Yes.

2

A

Then? of course, the seaman wouldn’t get

3

anything and he's come away empty-handed and that would be

4

controlling.

5

Q

Why couldn’t he come to the Court at that

A

1 doubt if he could then, Mr. Chief Justice,

6
7

stage?

3

because if he did then there would be nothing due him because

9

he had agreed to go into the arbitration proceeding.

10

11

Q

Does the grievance procedure and the arbitra­

tion operation have the power to subpoena?

12

A

Mot that I know of? no, sir.

13

Q

So that if the employer wanted to engage in'

14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

dilatory tactics in not having their master or other available
and they didn't want to take their depositions they could delay
an arbitration a good deal longer than they could do it in
Federal Court by power of subpoena.
A

That is correct, sir.

And so I think, Your Honors, that it8s best to leave
the law as is and if they want to substitute the collective
baxgaining run before the statute, I think the place to do that
is in the Congress and not to come here and ask Your Honors to
do that and I think it is salutary that we have both remedies so
that the seaman can choose which one he wants.
Thank you.
