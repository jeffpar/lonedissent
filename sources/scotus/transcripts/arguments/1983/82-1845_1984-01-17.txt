ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN LEON BERNARD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On the 7th day of November of 1981, Denver

11

Detective Sergeant Don DeNovellis obtained information

12

from a confidential informant.

13

Detective DeNovellis that a person known as Antonio

14

Guadalupe Nunez had been seen by the informant within

15

the last 24 hours preparing heroin for sale.

16

diluting the heroin and putting it into balloons, a

17

common mode of packaging for sale.

18

Detective DeNovellis that Mr. Nunez said that he had

19

recently been to Mexico and in Mexico he had purchased

20

five ounces of heroin.

21

The informant told

He was

The informant told

Detective DeNovellis then obtained a search

22

warrant based upon this information and, along with

23

Adams County Sheriff's officers, went to Mr. Nunez's

24

home in Adams County, Colorado.

25

and searched Mr. Nunez and from his pocket they took 15

They entered the home

3

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

balloons which contained heroin.
Mr. Nunez was charged with possession of a

2
3

Schedule One Controlled Substance in Colorado and his

4

counsel filed a motion to suppress the fruits of that

5

search, alleging in part there was no probable cause for

6

that search.
He also filed a motion for the disclosure of

7

8

this particular confidential informant who provided this

9

information.

10

A hearing was held in September of 1982

upon that motion for disclosure.
At that time, Mr. Nunez himself testified.

11

He

12

stated among other things that he was off in the

13

mountains hunting in his motor home, that he had to been

14

to Mexico, and that the only people who had been at his

15

home within 24 hours of the 7th day of November of 1981

16

were members of his immediate and extended family.
He also said at one point during cross

17
18

examination that he did not know what heroin was.

19

The court, based upon this information,

20

ordered the prosecution to disclose the name of the

21

informant.

22
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Bernard, do you think that the

Colorado court based its holding on federal law?
MR. BERNARD:

I certainly do, Justice

O'Connor, and for the following reasons:
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

The court in the case of Colorado versus Nunez

1

2

relied upon three prior Colorado decisions.

The first

3

decision was People versus Dailey which had been decided

4

approximately one and a half years before.
In People versus Dailey, the Colorado Supreme

5

6

Court referred at one point to the Colorado

7

Constitution, but at that time it was only for the

8

amount of information necessary to begin a veracity

9

hearing .
QUESTION:

10

Well, on that point, I think Dailey

11

states that in Colorado the rule is that a defendant is

12

entitled to a veracity hearing once he shows a good

13

faith basis for believing the material in the affidavit

14

was inaccurate.

15

based on federal law?

Now, do you think that that holding is

MR. BERNARD:

16

Your Honor, I would like to say

17

so, but I don't believe that I can, because there is an

18

indication —

19

QUESTION:

Well, no, it is not.

20

MR. BERNARD:

There is an indication clearly

21

that it was based upon the Colorado Constitution.

22

the issue in this case concerns the disclosure of the

23

informant.

The Colorado court in Dailey —

24

QUESTION:

The Roviaro-McCray issue?

25

MR. BERNARD:

That is correct.

That is

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

But,

1

correct.
QUESTION:

2

On that you think the Colorado law

3

is the same as or based on federal law on that aspect of

4

the question?
MR. BERNARD:

5

6

that.

7

McCray.

Justice Lohr said exactly

They have adopted the same test of Roviaro versus

If I may elaborate on my answer a little bit,

8
9

Yes.

in the Dailey opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court said

10

specifically that while the Colorado Constitution may

11

support a lesser amount of evidence shown, when it

12

talked about what consequences, and disclosure is one of

13

the consequences, that must flow from the decision the

14

court must make after that showing, it referred

15

specifically to both the United States Constitution and

16

to the Colorado Constitution.
At that hearing — After that hearing and

17
18

after the order of disclosure, the prosecution took an

19

interlocutory appeal to the Supreme Court of the State

20

of Colorado in which that issue was addressed.
The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the lower

21

22

court's decision and we petitioned for certiorari.

23

Court granted review.
The issue in this case is essentially

24
25

twofold .

This

QUESTION:

1

Excuse me

In Colorado is it true

2

that you could have had an in camera hearing on this

3

point?
MR. BERNARD:

4
5

That is correct, Justice

Marshall.

6

QUESTION:

And, you didn't ask for it?

7

MR. BERNARD:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BERNARD:

No, we did not.

Why?
We were concerned for the

10

informant's safety.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BERNARD:

13

The first issue in this case is an issue that

In an in camera?
Yes, Your Honor.

14

was reserved in Franks versus Delaware.

15

at page 170, Justice Blackmun reserved the issue, a

16

difficult issue, of whether an informant should be

17

disclosed after a satisfactory showing at a veracity

18

hearing.

19

In that opinion

The issue in this case also concerns where, as

20

in the case at bar, if the counsel for the accused and

21

the court both concede that the credibility of the

22

police officer of Frank is not at issue, therefore,

23

should there be disclosure at all?

24

Before we get —

25

QUESTION:

Do you think the federal
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

Constitution imposes some limits on how liberal a

2

state's rule of evidence can be on that point?
MR. BERNARD:

3

Your Honor, I believe that this

4

goes to a question of Fourth Amendment interpretation

5

and the exclusionary rule.
First of all, beginning with Aguilar and

6
7

Spinelli and with this Court's recent decision in

8

Illinois versus Gates, there is clearly an issue of

9

whether a confidential informant can be used in a search

10

warrant.

11

Amendment issue.

12

When that happens, that becomes a Fourth

This is not merely a question of evidentiary

13

law, but this is a question of the application of the

14

Fourth Amendment.

15

The question is, therefore, does the Fourth

16

Amendment require disclosure if, after a veracity

17

hearing, there is a certain showing.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

Do you think the Fourth Amendment

forbids the disclosure of an informant's name?
MR. BERNARD:

Yes.

We submit that the Fourth

21

Amendment does that.

And, we submit, even assuming in

22

certain situations that the Fourth Amendment does permit

23

disclosure of an informant's name after an appropriate

24

showing at a veracity hearing in our case, that should

25

not be because the whole purpose of a veracity hearing
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

is to question whether the state itself has erred in any

2

way, whether there has been police misconduct, if the

3

affiant's credibility is not at issue.

4

if the affiant in good faith relied upon what he was

5

told by his informant, then there is no purpose, no

6

application, no deterrant result for the exclusionary

7

rule.

8
9

QUESTION:

How will you get to the veracity if

you don't admit who the person is, if you don't have an

10

in camera investigation?

11

That means truth, doesn't it?

12

truth if you hide the truth?

13

In other words,

MR. BERNARD:

You use the word "veracity."
How do you get to the

Well, Justice Marshall, first of

14

all, I do not believe that the purpose of using

15

confidential informants is to hide the truth.

16

this Court has recognized what their use is in the past.

17

The issue at a veracity hearing —

18

QUESTION:

I think

Well, what remedy does the defense

19

counsel have if the government says we have this

20

information, but we won't tell you where we got it from?

21

MR. BERNARD:

First, the defense counsel could

22

strenuously cross examine the affiant himself.

23

affiant was present in —

QUESTION:

MR. BERNARD:

The officer, yes.
I would hope that the officer —

He is a well trained person?
Yes, sir.

So, if you can't break him down,

then you lose.
MR. BERNARD:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

There is —

12

QUESTION:

What else can you do?

13

MR. BERNARD:

There are alternative forms of

14

information.

15

from the accused himself, information from other people

16

whom the accused may bring into the court who have

17

information to give to the court on this issue.

18

For example, as in this case, information

Hypothetically, if the assertion had been that

19

I had not been at my home when that person said I was

20

there, and the defendant could bring in people who could

21

say, yes, he was not at his home, he was with me. That

22

would be an alternative form of establishing that

23

information.

24
25

So, I submit there are at least two
alternatives.

One is questioning the affiant and one is
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

permitting the defense himself to bring in information

2

to attack the credibility of the affiant.

4

QUESTION:

But, why can't you have the in

camera hearing?

5

MR. BERNARD:

6

QUESTION:

7

Is there somebody in there that you

don't trust?

8

MR. BERNARD:

9

QUESTION:

10

you to name them.
MR. BERNARD:

12

QUESTION:

14

No.

Because if you say so, I will ask

11

13

An in camera hearing —

No.

Well, why can't you have an in

camera hearing?
MR. BERNARD:

Because an in camera hearing, we

15

feel, has certain threats.

16

informant knows that he is going to be brought before a

17

court, even in camera without defense counsel'present,

18

he may not provide the police the information that is

19

neccessary to either solve a crime or to —

20

QUESTION:

One threat is this.

If an

If I assume that correct and I also

21

assume that on the same facts an informant would not

22

hesitate to lie because nothing could be done about it.

23

MR. BERNARD:

Justice Marshall, I submit that

24

there is always the possibility that an informant may

25

lie and I think that is undeniable.

There is always the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

possibility that a police officer may lie.

But, I don't

2

think that the presumption is either that police

3

officers or informants lie.

4

itself was established to permit a flow of information.

I think that the privilege

5

And, I think in McCray versus Illinois Justice

6

Weintraub forsaw exactly the problem that we see in this

7

case.
In the quote that I have cited in my brief,

8
9

Justice Weintraub says that if a defendant knows that he

10

can submit to the court any evidence at all, the court

11

itself is going to order disclosure because they have no

12

ability to impeach.

13

always be disclosed and the whole chain of information

14

will be broken, the flow of information will be dried

15

up.

At that point, the informant will

16

If at a veracity hearing the purpose is to

17

determine whether there is probable cause to believe

18

that the accused has committed a crime and probable

19

cause to believe that at his residence are the fruits of

20

that crime, then in this case the disclosure of the

21

informant is an ancillary part of that.

22

the probable cause determination.

23

It is part of

Since Aguilar and Spinelli and Gates made

24

rules under our Constitution to govern the use of

25

confidential informants and warrants the decision
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) S28-9300

1

whether to disclose them becomes a Fourth Amendment

2

consideration here.

3

As I said to Justice O'Connor earlier, it is

4

not a question of evidentiary law, state evidentiary

5

law, it is part and parcel of the Franks versus Delaware

6

analysis and it is part and parcel of the issue that

7

this Court reserved in that case.

8
9

There is an issue as to whether there was an
independent and adequate state grounds for this decision

10

which Justice O'Connor raised.

11

Court has established in a series of cases, Delaware

12

versus Prouse, South Dakota versus Neville, culminating

13

with Michigan versus Long, which was decided in July of

14

1983, I believe, indicates that this Court presumes that

15

there is not an independent and adequate state grounds

16

if there is not a clear and express showing on the face

17

of the opinion.

18

The tests that this

In this case, as far as the issue of

19

disclosure is concerned, there was no clear and

20

independent showing of state law.

21

to be derived from a veracity hearing, there was no

22

clear and independent showing of state law.

23
24
25

As far as any remedy

Based upon that presumption, I submit that
this Court does and should take jurisdiction.
In the Colorado Supreme Court's decision in
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the Nunez case — It referred, as I said earlier, to

2

three cases — The case of Dailey, the case of Martinez,

3

and the case of Bueno.

4

about disclosure, it referred to two things. First,

5

Franks versus Delaware, which was a case decided by this

6

Court on Fourth Amendment grounds, and then the Court

7

talked about solely in Dailey if there is the affiant's

8

perjury or reckless disregard for the truth, the

9

Colorado Court discussed that remedy in terms of Dailey

In Dailey, when the Court talked

10

— Excuse me, in terms of Franks only.

11

in terms only of the Colorado Constitution.

12

In fact —

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BERNARD:

15
16

Constitution.

In other words,

Of what Constitution?
Excuse me, in the United States

I apologize, Justice White.

My mistake.

In fact, that Court said that the test for

17

disclosure is the same as this Court established in

18

Roviaro and in McCray versus Illinois.

19

QUESTION:

20

the disposition of the case?

21

the judgment should be reversed.

22

say that the Colorado Supreme Court could not reinstated

23

its prior judgment and explain that it really did mean

24

to base it on Colorado law?

25

May I just ask one question about

MR. BERNARD:

Your brief ends by saying
Do you mean by that to

Justice Stevens, that is always
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

a possibility.

2

this was a decision that should have been decided on

3

Colorado State law, refer to the Colorado Constitution

4

and decided that way.

5

The Colorado Supreme Court could say

QUESTION:

So, the outcome of the case con­

6

ceivably — we don't say it would — but conceivably be

7

exactly the same no matter what we do.

8
9

MR. BERNARD:

I would submit that if this

Court reversed, the Colorado Supreme Court would be

10

bound by this Court's opinion.

11

Colorado Supreme Court wished to adopt the Colorado

12

Constitution, then it could do so.

13
14

QUESTION:

But, do you think we can tell them

they must hold a veracity hearing?

15

MR. BERNARD:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

If, in a later case, the

Well, I believe —

I mean, they must direct the lower

court to hold a veracity hearing?
MR. BERNARD:

I believe so, especially since

19

it referred to the United States Constitution.

20

since this Court is the ultimate arbiter of that

21

Constitution, I believe that this Court can say that.

22
23

QUESTION:

And,

And they have lost their authority

to reach the same conclusion based on state law?

24

MR. BERNARD:

25

QUESTION:

I would submit that they have.

Well, Mr. Bernard, that is quite a
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

remarkable conclusion, I think, that you reach in answer

2

to Justice Stevens' question that — I can see how we

3

could say in correct case that the Fourth Amendment

4

doesn't require the sort of rule which the Colorado

5

Supreme Court thought it required, but you are saying

6

that even though the Colorado Supreme Court wished to

7

base its ruling on state law, the Fourth Amendment

8

prevents it from doing that.

9
10

11

MR. BERNARD:

No, I am not saying that,

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well then, could you spell out

12

exactly how you reach the conclusion that you do in

13

answer to Justice Stevens' question?

14

MR. BERNARD:

Certainly.

This Court can

15

decide the federal issue present in this case.

If it

16

does so, then the Court must say that since the Colorado

17

Supreme Court referred to the consequences under the

18

United States Constitution, the Colorado Supreme Court

19

cannot take the United States Constitution and do what

20

it wanted to do in this case.

21

If the Colorado Supreme Court wishes to rely

22

on the State Constitution, I concur it is the ultimate

23

arbiter of that Constitution.

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

And, in any mandate that

comes down from this Court to a state court reversing
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

the state court opinion says the judgment is reversed

2

and the cause or matter for further proceedings is not

3

inconsistent with this opinion.

4

proceeding be a hearing by the Colorado Supreme Court in

5

which it said, well, we also relied on our State

6

Constitution or, although we didn't before, we now rely

7

on our State Constitution to reach the result we did?
MR. BERNARD:

8
9

Wouldn't such a

Justice Rehnquist, I would

submit that that certainly is a possibility, however,

10

if, in fact, that were the case, I am not cognizant of

11

the subsequent decisions in Michigan versus Long at the

12

state level and South Dakota versus Neville at the state

13

level.
QUESTION:

14

That wouldn't take our jurisdiction

15

away to hear the case, but I think that that would mean

16

that your answer to Justice Steven's question perhaps

17

ought to be reconsidered.
MR. BERNARD:

18

Well, Justice Rehnquist, I guess

19

what my position is is this; that this Court can tell

20

the Colorado Constitution it can't do what it did under

21

the United States Constitution.

22

under the Colorado Constitution, I suppose they can do

23

so.

24
25

QUESTION:

If it wishes to do that

Haven't several state supreme

courts done that after we have reversed on the federal

MR. BERNARD:

3

QUESTION:

4

The Opperman case, I think, South

Dakota.
MR. BERNARD:

5

6

Yes.

Yes.

And, I know California has

done that too.
QUESTION:

7

Several of them have done that.

8

That might lead some people to the conclusion that the

9

Court should not have been so ambiguous about the basis

10

of its holding.
MR. BERNARD:

11

Well, ultimately I think that

12

that is probably an appropriate resolution anyway.

13

court does decide that it is going to rely on state law

14

— I think Michigan versus Long says if it is going to

15

do that it should make it very clear and that has not

16

been done in this case.
Ultimately, there is no Fourth Amendment

17
18

violation if an affiant in good faith —

MR. BERNARD:

1

At the time the Colorado case

2

was decided, there was in existence the following cases:

3

Delaware versus Prouse, South Dakota versus Neville, and

4

those cases indicated that there is an appropriate basis

5

for this Court taking jurisdiction.

6

independent ground, but it is not adequate and that was

7

the prior test.

There may be an

In fact, in our petition for writ of

8
9

certiorari, in the jurisdiction statement at pages 1

10

through 9, we did argue those cases and not Michigan

11

versus Long.
I think even under those tests there is an

12

13

appropriate basis for this Court to take jurisdiction

14

and there is not independent adequate state grounds.
QUESTION:

15
16

But, you do contend, don't you,

that Michigan against Long announced a new rule of law?

17

MR. BERNARD:

18

QUESTION:

19

Do you argue that rule is

retroactive?

20

MR. BERNARD:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

Your Honor, I am —

Maybe that is the issue in the

case, whether Michigan against Long is retroactive.
MR. BERNARD:

23
24

Well —

That is not the issue here

obviously.
QUESTION:

Well, it is a jurisdictional issue
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

I might suggest.
MR. BERNARD:

2

This Court has to decide whether

3

it has jurisdiction.

4

Michigan versus Long is retroactive nor whether —
QUESTION:

5

And, we have not briefed whether

Are you content to have us decide

6

the jurisdictional issue without reference to Michigan

7

against Long?
MR. BERNARD:

8
9

because I think it is clearer.
QUESTION:

10

11

I would prefer to have it

You think it is a little helpful to

you?

12

MR. BERNARD:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BERNARD:

Yes, I do.

Yes.
The exclusionary rule which was

15

applied in this case, because the evidence was

16

suppressed when the state refused to disclose its

17

informant, balances two social issues.

18

the deterrent of police misconduct against convicting

19

guilty people.

20

application of the exclusionary rule if there is no

21

police misconduct.

22

effect, there is no need to let the guilty go free.

23

First of all,

There is no deterrence by the

Therefore, if there is no deterrent

The purpose of a veracity hearing, therefore,

24

has to be determine if the affiant, not the informant,

25

has engaged in misconduct.
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

There will be, I would submit, an effect on

2

law enforcement in revealing the names of confidential

3

informants on a regular basis.

4

of information which lead to the solving of crimes and

5

dry up sources of information that lead to the

6

apprehension of criminals.

7

That will dry up sources

It is a sad but true fact that some people

8

will not come forward and cooperate with the police

9

unless they are assured of anonymity.

10
11
12

13
14

QUESTION:

Sometimes it is bad for their

health, is it not?
MR. BERNARD:

It is, Your Honor.

And, that

sadly has been something that has happened in the past.
As we indicated before, we say that there is

15

no need as a matter of law ever to reveal an informant's

16

name and I discussed with Justice Marshall the

17

alternatives to disclosure of that informant.

18

However, even if an informant should be

19

revealed in some circumstances, he should not be

20

revealed here.

21

It was only private action in this case,

22

although there has been some indication by the

23

Respondent that the Respondent didn't mean to say that

24

he did not question the affiant's credibility,

25

nonethless, the record contains four separate references
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

\

1

to the fact that he was concerned with the informant,

2

not the affiant's credibility.

3

Secondly, disclosure does not serve in this

4

case, because there was no police misconduct, the Fourth

5

Amendment, or the purposes of the exclusionary rule.

6

Even people who are involved at the fringes of

7

the warrant process are going to be affected by the fact

8

that they will not be assured of anonymity.

9

We ask this Court to at least, as far as the

10

Fourth Amendment is concerned, indicate to the State of

11

Colorado that the disclosure of informants should not

12

occur at veracity hearings, and even if this Court feels

13

that disclosure is in some cases appropriate, we ask

14

this Court to indicate that the disclosure of the

15

informant in this case was inappropriate because there

16

was no indication, no allegation, and no proof that the

17

affiant lied or recklessly disregarded the truth.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH H. STERN, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

22
23

MR. STERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The way this case has been postured, both in

24

the briefs and during oral argument, is inconsistent

25

with the record below.

The Petitioner has raised and
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

melded together three separate issues, only one of which

2

was ever adjudicated in the Colorado court system.

3

In Colorado, the process of challenging a

4

search warrant, in making a veracity challenge, has

5

three separate steps.

6

preliminary showing to be entitled to a hearing in the

7

first place.

8

successful on the merits —

9
10

One step is making a threshold

The second step is actually being

QUESTION:

What is the purpose of that

veracity hearing as you call it out there?

11

MR. STERN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. STERN:

In Colorado?
Yes.
Well, the purpose of the veracity

14

hearing at this point in time under Colorado law is to

15

see if the affiant either committed perjury or reckless

16

disregard of the truth.

17

QUESTION:

The Colorado Supreme —

Let's put that in concrete terms.

18

What did the affiant say about the informant?

19

he say that is going to be tested in this hearing?

20

MR. STERN:

What did

One, does the information even

21

exist; and, two, if the informant does exist, did he

22

actually relate to the affiant what the affiant placed

23

in the affidavit.

24
25

QUESTION:
concrete terms.

Now, that doesn't tell me much in

What is it said that the informant
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

informed to the police in this case?
MR. STERN:

2
3

In the affidavit there is certain

information allegedly stated by an informant.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. STERN:

What was it?
It was that on a certain date that

6

the informant was in the home of the defendant and

7

observed the defendant engaged in certain conduct.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. STERN:

The conduct was packaging heroin.

QUESTION:

10
11

And, what was the conduct?

And, what happened when they made

the search?

12

MR. STERN:

13

QUESTION:

14

They did find heroin.
Does that have any bearing on

whether he was telling the truth?
MR. STERN:

15

Obviously, it would have some

16

bearing, Chief Justice, however, there are other

17

possible sources of informationt that could have lead to

18

the conclusion that Mr. Nunez had heroin which didn't

19

come through an informant.

20

commentators have stated that it is possible that

21

information could have come through an illegal wiretap.
QUESTION:

22

In fact, a number of the

Now, let me see.

I am not sure I

23

track you.

You say the informant told the police that

24

on a given day he was in the home of Nunez and that he

25

saw him engaged in handle dope, packaging it?
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. STERN:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is correct.
And then he gave that information

to the police?

4

MR. STERN:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And, they put that in whatever form

6

is required in Colorado law to get a warrant to search

7

the house, is that right?

8

MR. STERN:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. STERN:

12

QUESTION:

And then they found the packages

MR. STERN:

Very close to how he said they

would be, that is correct.
QUESTION:

16
17

Correct.

exactly as the informant said they would, is that right?

14
15

And then the police took that

warrant and went and searched the house, is that right?

11

13

Correct.

What is the problem about his

veracity then?
MR. STERN:

18

The problem about his veracity is

19

that the defendant testified that the informant could

20

not have done what it was alleged he had done in the

21

affidavit because on those dates in question the

22

defendant had not been in his home.

23

24

his vehicle during those two weeks. He was not in his

25

home when the informant said he was there.

He was away for two

He could not have been delivering heroin using

He was on a

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

fishing trip and that the only people who were there the

2

second half of the day were his immediate relatives.

3

So, there was testimony from the defendant

4

that created in the mind of the trial court judge a good

5

faith basis and fact to question the accuracy of the

6

affidavit.

7

Colorado law —

8
9

And, under that particular test, under

QUESTION:

What if the informant had said to

the police that he had been in the home of this man on a

10

day within recent weeks or months, and he could not

11

remember the day or the week, but that he distinctly saw

12

him putting narcotics in packages on that day unnamed?

13

It would make it a little difficult for the man to say

14

he wasn't there at that time, wouldn't it?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. STERN:

That would create a different

problem of proof.
QUESTION:

Would it be sufficient to issue a

warrant if the informant could not fix the date?
MR. STERN:

That would be up to the magistrate

20

to determine if that was sufficient to establish

21

probable cause.

22

However, in the instant case, you have an

23

informant saying he was located in the house at a

24

particular time when, based upon testimony under oath by

25

the defendant and other collateral evidence, he could
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not — At least created a reasonable basis and fact to

2

believe that he could not have been in the house, and,

3

therefore, Colorado, under Colorado's common law, as an

4

evidentiary matter allows the informant to be disclosed,

5

either in camera or to all the parties so that the

6

defendant can have a reasonable opportunity to make the

7

showing that he must make at the veracity hearing

8

itself.

9

QUESTION:

Who was it that had to decide

10

whether the defendant here was telling the truth when he

11

said he was out on a fishing trip on that day?

12

MR. STERN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STERN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

The trial court judge.
Without a jury?
Without a jury.
And, is that an in camera

proceeding in Colorado or is it an open hearing?
MR. STERN:

Well, the first stage where the

18

defendant must meet his burden of showing good faith

19

basis and fact — the affidavit contains inaccuracies —

20

is an opening hearing. . If after hearing that, the trial

21

court judge decides that the defendant has met his

22

burden and, therefore, is entitled to either disclosure

23

in camera or to all the parties, then they would proceed

24

accordingly.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Stern, do you think that

I do not.

13

As I was stating before, the issue regarding a

14

must prove to be successful at the veracity hearing

16

In fact, if you were to remand this case —

That second motion to suppress,

10

I would think, to the necessary conclusion that there is

11

not a federal basis for the Supreme Court of Colorado's

12

decision.

13

one than you say your oponents have painted.

14

It is just that its decision is a narrower

MR. STERN:

My response is twofold.

First,

15

the only issue is the motion to disclose informant.

16

Second, if you were to look at the four corners of the

17

Nunez opinion, there is not one federal authority cited,

18

not one federal case cited.

19

QUESTION:

It is only state cases.

Well, let me put this question —

20

Supposing that the District Court in Adams County says I

21

am going to order the disclosure of this informant

22

pursuant to Roviaro, which I think as being on us, the

23

no, we won't disclose, but I am going to appeal to the

Supreme Court of Colorado.

Colorado says under Roviaro this informant should have

MR. STERN:

That is absolutely not what

11

corners of the Nunez opinion, they don't mention a

12

single federal case or federal authority.

consistent with Franks, but they stated our rule was the

And, in fact, in the Appendix to the Franks

QUESTION:

Do you think Roviaro is itself a

decision which construes the federal Constitution?
MR. STERN:

Roviaro is — This Court, as I

19

understand it, is acting in a supervisory capacity

20

dealing with an evidentiary matter based upon federal

21

common law.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But, McCray, of course, would be

construing the Constitution.
MR. STERN:

Absolutely.

And, in fact, it was

McCray that established clearly that Roviaro was not

rather this Court acting in a supervisory capacity.
And, there is nothing inconsistent in McCray

3
4

from what Colorado has done.

5

McCray decision is the most supportive of the authority

6

and right of the Colorado Supreme Court to create

7

evidentiary rules regarding the common law informant's

privilege as it sees fit, just the way it can create

Well, it can be more favorable to

12

the defendant, criminal defendant in that area.

13

can't be less favorable.

MR. STERN:

It

Isn't that what it —

Well, the only way, in my opinion,

15

that the United States Constitution would get involved

16

in this question would be if the Colorado Supreme Court

17

interpreted the common law informant's privilege in such

18

a way that it infringed upon defendant's rights.

19

For example, if it said a defendant may never

20

get disclosure for trial or at a suppression hearing,

21

that would run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment.

22

if Colorado did come up with a liberal interpretation,

23

certainly since there is no constitutional principle or

24

no constitutional right enjoyed by a law enforcement

25

agent or by the informant to not have the identity

Given that fact, as long as the Colorado
