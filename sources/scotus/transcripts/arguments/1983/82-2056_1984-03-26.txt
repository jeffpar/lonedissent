A recognition of the reserve

I don’t think anything in that sense

I think that our statute precludes us from

such a finding.

It would be ultra viries of our

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

authority.

To that extent, I think the District Court

2

opinion would be the one that is cold sway in the day,

3

that is, that courts make that determination, and this

4

Commission, if it tried to do so, it seems to me, would

5

be exercising absolute power that it just doesn’t have.
I would like to turn to the legislative

6
7

history which I think supports our view.

First of all,

8

I want to point out there is an error at Page 5 cf cur

9

second supplemental brief in which we attribute to

10

Congressman -- excuse me, to Senator Walsh a statement

11

made by Congressman Walsh in an effort to distinguish

12

Senator Walsh’s apparent approval of the veto

13

authority.
That is an unfortunate error.

14

I am sorry for

15

it.

But in any event it seems to us that Senator

16

Walsh's statement is not all that persuasive.

17

made in terms of a discussion with regard to the

18

appropriateness of giving the Indians the authority to

19

stop a project and the Senator was responding to that.

20

Also, Congressman Walsh, the statement we attribute to

21

the Senate, did make that statement.

22

Congresman Fayka, who in fact was the House proponent of

23

the Administration’s bill and made clear that he thought

24

one vote could not terminate a project with two votes on

25

the Commission, which was then comprised of the three

There are statements in the Secretary's brief

It is the Secretary's position here that the

2

statute, Section h(e), means exactly what it says.

The

4

statute provides that licenses may be issued for

5

projects on reservations, but only if the Commission

11

reasonableness of these conditions.

12

that point certainly could challenge -- the applicant

13

for the license certainly could challenge those

14

conditions in the Court of Appeals, and the Secretary

15

would be obligated to defend those conditions under the

statutory standard that is laid out in 4(e).

In other words, the Secretary must show that

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT INDIAN MISSION BANDS
MR. PELCYGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court,

I would like to begin by addressing a

few of the issues that were raised previously.
First of all, with regard to the judicial

7

review

Question, I agree with Justice White's analysis

9

of that.

Let me just add that I see no difference

10

between the Court of Appeals'

11

conditions as opposed to the Commission’s own conditions.
The record is compiled before the Federal

and an

QUESTION;

you.

And this is the relicensing

16

provision, and T don't understand why there's a

17

controversy about whether this is an original licensing

18

or a relicensing, because the relicensing provision

19

specifically says that the Commission can issue either a

20

new license or an original license under the then

21

existing laws and regulations, and obviously the

22

reservation proviso is an existing law.
So, as the Court of Appeals for the District

which is cited in the briefs,

MR. PELCYGER;

To put that issue in context,

our first position is that the provision of the Michigan

Indian Relief Act must be giver effect because the

reservation proviso specifically protects against

9

interference the purposes of Indian reservations.
The Mission Indian Relief Act defines the

10

purposes of Indian reservations, and therefore pursuant

to 4(e) must be given effect, tut if the Court disagrees

13

with that, and if the Court concludes that somehow the

10

obtaining canal rights of way across Mission

That makes nc sense whatsoever.

The one point on which all parties in this

15

requires a Commission license.

1

the Secretary contend,

requiring both a Commission

2

license as well as compliance with Section 8 of the

Mission Indian Relief Act gives effect to both statutes

4

while preserving their overall sense and purpose, and

5

does not subordinate one to the other.
On the definition of reservations, I agree

6
7

with hr. Schulder. The ambiguity that is created here is

8

that water rights are expressly concluded, and there is

9

no doubt about that, within the Act’s definition of

10

reservations.

That much is clear and unambiguous.

11

ambiguity arises because the reservation proviso applies

12

to licenses within a reservation, and the question is,

13

how can a license be within a water right?
That doesn't really make sense,

14

The

and so that is

a real

true to life ambiguity, and our contention is

16

that that ambiguity has to be resolved in favor of the

17

First and foremost is that that interpretation

18
19

carries out and furthers the evident protective purpose

20

toward

21

the reservation proviso itself as well as in the broad

22

definition cf reservation in the Act,

23

Mr. Schulder pointed out, because of the provision in

24

Section 23(b) that indicates that the word

thirdly, because

2

Section 10(e) of the Act expressly uses the term "tribal

3

when manual charges are to be fixed by the Commission.
So, when Congress wanted to limit the term
