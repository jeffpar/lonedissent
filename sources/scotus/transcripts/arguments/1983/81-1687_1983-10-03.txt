ORAL ARGUHENT OF DEAN C. DUNLAVEY, ESQ.,

ON EEHALF CF FETITICNEES
HR. DUNLAVEY;

Since the advent of free off-the-air

Hr. Chief Justice and may it

television in the United States in about 19U8, it has

10

become what is undoubtedly today’s most important

11

ccmitunicaticn medium.

12

progress since all of that time, which most of us lived

13

through.

14

black and white has gone to color, tubes have gone tc

15

transistors, and live broadcasting has gone tc delayed

16

broadcasting using pretty much the same VTR that we’re

17

concerned about here this morning.

There has teen a let of technical

The small screen has gone to the large screen,

television shews all had tc be broadcast live because

20

there was no means of recording them.

21

fact, in 1976 Sony get an Emmy from the National Academy

22

of Television Arts and Sciences for the VTR, which had

23

enabled delayed broadcast of an earlier recorded shew.

24

As a matter of

And new progress has continued.

That same VTE

has been put in the hands of the public so that, instead

3

copyright owners or a few of them whc are profiting ty

exploiting their product on free television arrest this

5

latest progress of science?

And the Question this morning is«

Can the

For the Court's information# by the end cf

8
7

this year there are expected to be something like 9-1/2

8

million video tape recorders in television households.

9

That is at or near at or past the ten percent mark cf

10

television households in America.
Now, this case has left us with three issues

11

12

that I would like to address this morning.

The first#

13

cf course, is dees the homeowner commit a direct

14

infringement when he records the program at home with

15

his VTR?

16

committed a direct infringement?

In short, when he makes the tape has he

The answer to that lies in the fair use

17
18

section.

19

that's a di sere tion-type statute which tells the court

20

that you can apply common sense to any instance where

21

there seems to be literal infringement and if it's net a

22

fair result then it doesn't have to be treated as

23

infringement.
The Ninth Circuit subdivided that into two

24
25

That’s Section 107 of the Copyright Act, ard

questions.

First of all, it said that fair use has to

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST 8T., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

5

1

be a productive use, like the first author using a

2

second author's works -- a second author using a first

3

author's works in creating something new.

4

of that is called intrinsic, where you're using a

5

copyrighted article in much the same way or exactly the

6

same way as you would have used the original.

7

Circuit says it has to be productive as a matter of

8

law.

The converse

The Ninth

9

It alsc left us with a factual question as to

10

what is the effect vis a vis the copyright owner cf the

11

heme recording, because if you're testing for fair use

12

the effect on the copyright owner is probably the most

13

import ant.

14

The third test, assuming, just assuming that

15

home recording is direct infringement, the question is

16

has there been contributory infringement by the VTR

17

suppliers, manufacturers and suppliers, for having dene

18

nothing more than to make the machine available.
Sew, taking these three ad seriatim, the

19
20

productive test is best answered if you could find seme

21

indication on the part of Congress that a productive use

22

was in fact contemplated among the variety of fair

23

uses.

24
25

COESTIQB:

Well, hr. Dunlavey, would you agree

that Congress when it kind of codified the fair use

The answer is yes,

found to be fair use in the past.
QUFSTICNs

Isn't it accurate to say, with

12

respect to the law at the time Congress codified it,

13

that fair use required some sort of a productive use,

14

like one author — a bock reviewer quoting a text in a

15

beck review or something like that?

16

NR. DUNLAVEY;

I submit, Justice Fehnquist ,

17

that that was most definitely net Congress' intention,

18

and I have three examples to put before Your Honor tc

19

support that.

20

First of all, remember the Williams £ Wilkins

21

case had been an intrinsic kind of usage, where medical

22

articles were Xeroxed and distributed to doctors in lieu

23

of originals.

That was an intrinsic use.

24

QUESTION;

25

divided Court here.

It was affirmed by an equally

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

7

MR. DUNLAVEY;

1

Which left it the law of the

2

land, at least in the Court of Claims.

3

well known case of intrinsic use just at the time

4

Congress was passing the new Act, and Congress made r.o

5

indication that it disapproved of the outcome of that

6

case.

7

mind and they accepted the intrinsic use.

Sc arguably Williams £ Wilkins was in Congress'

But T can do tetter than that.

8

9

So it was a very

Senate report at pages 65 and

In the 1975

'6, it talked about the

10

school whose classroom schedule does not synchronize

11

with a broadcaster's television schedule.

12

the time the broadcaster is putting out an educational

13

program that the students want to see, the students

14

aren't in class.

It means that

That specific example was in the Senate report

15
16

and it said that that school could record off the air

17

the broadcast for delayed viewing at a time when class

18

was in session and that would be an example of fair

19

use.

20

because, first of all, that's an intrinsic use and

21

Congress is approving it.

22
23
24
25

And there we've killed four birds with one stcne

Secondly, it's the copying of an entire work
and Congress is approving that.
Thirdly, the purpose is time shift and
Congress is approving that.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

8

And lastly, it's for convenience, the very

1

2

same reason that the homeowner is doing it.

He can't

3

see the show when it's broadcast, so he records it for

4

later.
But that still isn't the end of it, because in

5
6

the 1976 Conference Committee report they acknowledge

7

that the educators and the copyright owners had

8

negotiated and would continue to- negotiate on what were

9

called guidelines, and these were to be examples of fair

10

use.

11

people agree upon will be regarded as part of the

12

conferees' understanding of fair use.

13
14
15

And the conference report said that whatever these

Do you think that involves any

problem of unlawful delegation?
HR. DUNLAVEYi

That's occurred to me and I

16

can't answer it.

17

along and agreed to guidelines, and therefore Universal,

18

of all people, is not in a position to claim that there

19

20

Eut fortunately. Universal has come

In 1981 guidelines were adopted for off the

10

So I would submit that the Ninth Circuit by

11

one of those three, twc of them or all three of those

12

has erred because it has said productive is a sine oca

13

non.

It obviously is not.
QUESTION:

14

Hr. Eunlavey, I suppose of course

15

the Court doesn't have to resolve this question in order

16

tc resclve the contributory infringement question.

17

Court could resolve it as a means of getting to the

18

contributory infringement question, but does it have

19

tc?

20

HR. DUNLAVEY:

The

Justice O'Connor, that's

21

precisely right.

There are twc reads tc Rome.

Ycu can

22

say that there is direct infringement but nevertheless

23

there was no contributory infringement or, as you have

24

just suggested, you can say, whether or net there was

25

direct infringement, and we bypass that question, there

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

10

1

clearly was nothing that constitutes contributory

2

infringement.

3

this case without resolving whether home use is

4

inf ringement.

So Your Honor is correct, you can resclve

Now, if you’re going to make the conventional

5
6

fair use test, assuming that it can be fair use, the

7

question is whether it is, the most important test cf

8

all by common sense and by general acknowledgment is

9

what's the effect on the copyright owner.

Because I

10

don't think anybody has trouble with the concept that

11

you really shouldn't be using the copyright owner’s

12

works against him, all other things being equal.
So the question is, recognizing that the

13
14

copyright owner for some reason doesn’t want you to do

15

it — you have to assume infringement — but recognizing

18

that there may be other reasons why he should have tc

17

put up with it, the test is first of all let’s see what

18

is the. effect on him.

19

New, the Ninth Circuit with nc explanation

20

simply says, it seems clear that home recording does

21

tend to diminish the potential market fer the

22

Universal-Disney works.

25

No explanation, just ipse

Conversely, the district court had said
several things.

Firstly, it said that Universal-Eisney

That's a fact.

2

There's no argument about that.

At the time of the

which was several years after roost of the

Then the question comes about predicting the

5

e

future, and the district court listened to the witnesses

7

and the surveys and came to the conclusion that there

8

was no likelihood of prospective harm and there was no

9

reduction in the potential market for Universal's and

10

11

Disney 's .
Sow, the district court did that after hearing

12

four general kinds of complaints by Universal-Disney •

13

First of all, Universal-Disney said, the money that we

14

get for putting our shows on television is determined by

15

the ratings systems, and the bigger the audience the

16

more we make.

17

but the ratings system doesn't pick him up, then we

18

don't get paid, so we've been hurt.

19

And if the VTR owner joins the audience

The district court listened to a ratings

20

expert and concluded that the VTR owners will be

21

measured as part of the broadcast audience by the

22

ratings services, and he was dead right.

23

the VTR set in a household just the same as it counts a

24

TV set, so the audience of the VTR owners is measured.

QUESTION;

MR. DUNLAVEY;

5

No, the fact that they make the

argument today certainly does net indicate that the

7

record stood in their favor at the time of trial.

have bitten off a little bit more than I can chew.

I think the district court may

that they’re doing it new, sc that the district court's

conclusion was right.
QUESTION;

But if not, the fact is

Another complaint that they

made was that, by virtue of having recorded something at

18

there’ll be no librarying to any significant extent.

19

And today, the current use of the VTB# 60 percent is

20

21

squeezes librarying down into what’s left of 60 plus 30

percent.

But the fact of the matter was at the time of

Finally, they complained that there would be a

Sheinberg, who was the President cf Universal, took the

stand and in all seriousness said this will be the

In fact,

Wasserman, who's the head of *CA and Universal, and gave

his testimony, often quoted, that forecasts of doom in

So the summary on the effect test is that no

one is viewing the home recordings off the air except

members within the intended audience at the time of the

ME. DUNLAVEYi

If the parade of horribles came

Yes, I suppose Congress could

deal with any of these problems.

But having given the

8

courts the fair use statute, the courts can deal with

Do you think we should look to one of those

two fields for precedent, and if so would you not lock

13

14

MR. KROFT;

Why not?
I do not think you should look to

15

the patent law in this particular case because the

18

patent law is a statute which was designed specifically

17

to meet years of history in this Court dealing with

13

certain patent problems, that is misuse and contributory

19

infringement.

20

And it alsc deals, Justice Stevens, with the

21

very peculiar attributes of patents.

up of a series of components which together, taken as a

23

whole, end up being something that’s protected as an

24

invention.

Patents are made

And that's not the case with copyrights.
In addition to that, I might add that the

you took it as a fact -- I know you don *t -- that there

were, that the time shifting actually enlarges the size

9

cf the audience.

10
11
12

13

Assume that's a fact.

Then could you

possibly show harm?
HE. KRGFT:

Yes.

There are two answers to

that. Justice Stevens, one legal and one factual.
The legal answer is that the cases have held

14

that just because there may be an increase in one market

15

— and let's assume under your hypothetical that there

16

is — that dees not destroy the copyright owner's rights

17

to enforce his copyright under the fair use doctrine if

18

there are going to be harms in other markets, because

19

it's up to the copyright owner to determine how and in

20

what manner and in what markets and in what progression

21

he will exploit his product.

22

The factual answer to your question is that

23

the so-called increase in audience depends on who's in

24

that increased audience.

25

advertiser support.

The name of the game here is

They pay for the audiences and the

35

1

broadcasters in turn then pay the suppliers cf the

2

produc t.

3

If that increased audience, for example#

4

included people whom the advertiser cf a particular

5

program wasn't interested in reaching — for example# a

6

truck driver who doesn't buy the family detergent, likes

7

to record soap operas for some reason or another, and

8

the advertiser now picks him up as a viewer at night

9

because he watches his time shift recording — the

10

advertiser's not going to be willing to pay for him.

11

To allude tc a question you asked earlier,

12

although the district court in fact did find that the

13

ratings services at the time of trial were measuring

14

recordings,

16

found this — they were not measuring playbacks, neither

16

when it was played back nor who it was played back for.

17

they were not -- and the district court also

Another example of why your hypothetical would

18

not necessarily increase revenues or cause the fair use

19

defense tc come into play is because it depends when the

20

advertisement is watched.

21

is broadcast the week before Christmas and it's watched

22

the day after New Year's, it's of no value to the

23

advertiser and he's not going to pay for it.

fit the time cf

So it's quite misleading to suggest that we

10
11

only have that market because off the air recorders are

12

out there.

13

That's net at all the case.
The district court expressly found that off

14

the air recordings, both time -- and he didn't

15

differentiate in this finding between time shift and

16

library copies — will compete with the sale and rental

17

of those devices.

18

realize that that competition is going to reduce the

19

income to the Respondents from the sale and rental cf

20

their copyrighted motion pictures.

It doesn't take much imagination to

21

This is probably best illustrated by the fact

22

that this year the Electronics Industry Association has

23

estimated that there will be a sale of approximately 55

24

million blank cassettes in this country, as opposed to

25

only 8 million prerecorded cassettes.

they're just not willing to pay the extra price to buy a

bit more prudent and say I think there's a good chance

20

that it is no longer the law, because the legislative

history of the 1S76 statute specifically said with

respect to sound recordings that recapturing those sound

recordings off the air is a violation, and when it said

Sow, when you realize that this can’t be a

QUESTION*

Mr. Krcft, did you say Alaska

within itself had six different time zones?
MR. KROFTs

I did say that.

I may have erred

6

in the amount, but the reference in the House revert did

7

talk about the fact that Alaska, being so large, did

8

encompass several time zones, and that was the reason

9

that the House report in that unusual example indicated

10

that off the air copying for educational purposes there

11

might be allowed.

12

But the House report also went on to make very

13

clear that, even in the educational context, the fair

14

use doctrine had to be very narrowly circumscribed with

15

respect to motion pictures and generally should be

16

applied only to the use of excerpts.

17

With respect to the staple article of commerce

18

doctrine, I've explained, I believe, that it's not

19

really designed for the sale of things other than salt

20

tablets and dry ice and things of that nature.

21

addition to that, if we're going to analogize to the

22

patent statute, the patent statute also has a section

23

that says that when the seller of an article, even a

24

staple article, sells it with encouragement, urging or

25

inducement of some sort that it be used in an infringing

Eut in

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

way, and it is used in that way, then the seller cf that

2

article cannot escape liatility even though the article

3

may be a staple and even if he can prove the separate

4

and second test.

5

It has to be a staple and it has to be

6

suitable for substantial non-infringing use.

7

could prove those two things, if he sells it with

8

inducement and encouragement that it be used in an

9

infringing way then he’ll be held liable.

10
11

Even if he

And in this case the evidence shows beyond
dispute, and the district court did not find otherwise,

2

that Sony is selling this machine for the primary

3

purpose cf recording copyrighted works off the air,

4

including copyrighted works owned by the Eespondents;

5

and that the advertising and selling activities, as well

6

as the instruction manuals,

7

instructions as to how to record television programs off

8

the air, exhort and contribute to this copying.

which give very detailed

9

In fact, in recognition of what this machine

20

could and would do, Scny gave its advertising agency a

2

written indemnity agreement against any liability for

22

advertising Eetamax because, in the words of the

23

agreement, "our legal counsels were concerned about the

24

risks of advertising a video recording product that can

25

be used tc record copyrighted material."

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

44

Now, given those facts, you don't ever have to

1

2

reach the staple article of commerce doctrine.

And I

3

might add that even if the Court were to try to avoid

4

the fair use issue by reaching the contributory

5

infringement issue here, we still have other theories of

6

liability that weren’t addressed by the Ninth Circuit

7

below on which we also hold the Petitioners

8

responsible.
But even if the Court did reach the staple

9
10

article doctrine here. Petitioners have the burden cf

11

proving that the Eetamax is available and suitable for

12

substantial actual non-infringing uses, and the district

13

court very pointedly refused tc find on the evidence

14

brought before the court by Petitioners that that was

15

enough to allow the district court to find that Betairax

16

was suitable for substantial and actual non-fringing

use .
