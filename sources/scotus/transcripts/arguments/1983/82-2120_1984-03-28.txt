ORAL ARGUMENT CF E. RICHARD LARSON, ESC*/

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. LARSON;

may it

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

please the Court;
This case involves Petitioners' entitlement to

10
11

attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 in this

12

action

to enforce constitutional rights through Section

13

1933.

This case also involves fee entitlement under

14

Section 505(b)

15

brought to enforce and to charge a violation of Section

16

504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

of the Rehabilitation Act in this action

As in Vlum v. Stenson, decided unanimously by

17
18

this Court last week, resolution in this case begins and

19

ends with the legislative history accompanying these fee

20

provision, a legislative history in which Congress

21

stated

22

constitutional claim or on another overlapping fee claim

23

in order to be entitled to fees.

24
25

that plaintiffs need not prevail on a substantial

This case we submit is further controlled by
this Court's unanimous decision in Maher v. Gagne, a

3

1

decision in which this Court not only conclusively

2

applied the foregoing legislative history,

3

is the

same legislative history that is applicable

4

here.

And in that case this Court held that a plaintiff

5

who never obtained a ruling on her substantial

6

constitutional claim nonetheless was entitled to fees

7

under Section 1988.
In this case, Petitioner Tommy Smith is a

but indeed it

phyiscally and emotionally handicapped child who walks

10

with the aid of leg braces and crutches due to cerebral

11

palsy.

12

was commenced in 1976.

13

in a special education day program approved by the

14

Respondents and paid for by the school committee as part

15

of their education program.

16

Tommy was eight years old when this litigation
Tommy at that time was enrolled

This litigation was commenced when the local

17

school committee, with the subsequent approval and

18

support of the Respondents, proposed to exclude Tommy

19

from receiving an education solely because of the nature

20

of his handicap.

21

Respondents'

consistent litigation position

22

throughout this litigation has been that the school

23

committees, including the local school committee here,

24

and the Respondents had no responsibility for educating

25

Tommy or similarly situated persons who had an emotional

and also a straight equal protection claim — that

an education, in violation of equal protection.
Petitioners also alleged a federal claim under

11
12

Sectio n 50h of the F.ehabilit;ition Act, the language cf

13

which specifically precludes the ex clu sion of a pers on

14

from r eceiving fed eral benefits i n a f ede ra 1 program / a

progra m supported by federal mone ys, s clely on the b asi s

16

of han dicap.
A third federal claim was also alleged in this

17
18

case, the

'75 Handicapped Act.

After the Act became

19

effective and subsequent to plaintiff's success on their

20

constitutional claims, plaintiffs added the claim that

21

the Respondents had violated the Education for all

22

Handicapped Children Act of 1975.

23

Now, there is no question in this case about

24

the appropriateness of the education that was designed

25

for Tommy.

It’s simply a question of exclusion versus

There also is no question in this case

QUESTION;

Mr. Larsen, you say that your

clients prevailed throughout the litigation on their due

10

process claim.

11

is necessarily agreeing with that.

12

primarily as a

I didn’t read Judge Campbell's opinion

MR. LARSON;

The characterization of Judge

13

Campbell’s opinion -- or in the opinion, is that we

14

ultimately prevailed as a matter of the Education for

15

all Handicapped Children Act.

16

disagree whatsoever that throughout the course of this

17

litigation it was the preliminary injunction entered on

18

the due process claim pursuant to which plaintiffs

19

through the course of the litigation prevailed.

20

QUESTION :

Judge Campbell does not

What is the difference between

21

prevailing through the course of the litigation and

22

ultimately prevailing?

23

see these as two different thinga.

24
25

MR. LARSON;

I take it from your argument you

No,

I was saying that there is no

question on this record whatsoever, Justice F.ehnquist,

6

1

about the fact that the plaintiffs prevailed.

Hensley —

QUESTION;

23
24
25

I don’t believe that

Indeed, in the first

Well,

I think the Court of Appeals

agreed

that the plaintiff prevailed without a doubt.

But I

read the Court of Appeals opinion as intimating

that you prevailed on the EAHCA.
MR. LARSON;

Eut that is belied by the record,

Your H onor.
QUESTION;

But then you’re arguing about a

question of fact, really, where the Court of Appeals is
against you, and we ordinarily don’t review questions of
fact.

decision to the First Circuit —

15
16

Oh,

the plaintiff as having prevailed.

13
14

Well, tut the Court of Appeals

there is any question that the Court of Appeals viewed

9
10

Under

Justice Rehnquist,

it doesn't

matter with regard to the statutory threshold that
plaintiffs must meet through Hensley v. Eckerhart how
plaintiffs happened to prevail here.

The matter cf fact

as found by the district court is that plaintiffs did
prevail.

Indeed, our opponents at the fee hearing

admitted that we had obtained the objective sought in

7

1

the lawsuit and that we accordingly were the prevailing

2

P a r ty .

3

QUESTION:

Well,

but I don’t suppose anyone

4

disputes that, but I think, what the First Circuit says

5

is you prevailed on the EAHCA count; that’s an

6

all-embracing statutory claim that really covers

7

everything you could have gotten on your constitutional

8

counts, and since that doesn't provide for attorney’s

9

fees you can't get them.

10

MR. LARSON:

The First Circuit's decision on

11

the fee issue is different from the First Circuit's

12

decision on defendant's appeal on their motion to

13

dismiss.

14

states that plaintiffs have obtained the objective of

15

their lawsuit as a matter of state law.

16

merits.

17

Cn the first decision, the First Circuit

That’s on the

Subsequently in the collateral fee proceeding,

18

the First Circuit basically stated that the plaintiffs

19

have prevailed both as a matter of state law and as a

20

matter cf the Education for All Handicapped Children

21

Act, ultimately prevailed.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, did not the district

23

court,

after the decision cf the state supreme court,

24

say that you had prevailed as a result of the state

25

decisicn?

8

1

MR. LARSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LARSON:

The district court -It did?
— in its final order on the

4

merits held that we had obtained the objective of cur

5

lawsuit.
QUESTION:

you sought --

MR. LARSON:

QUESTION:

10

That you'd obtained all the relief

That's correct.
-- as a result of the state

decision.

11

MR. LARSON:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And was it not after that decision

13

was made by the district court that you filed your

14

second amendment and alleged a
MR. LARSON:

15
16

1983 action?

No, that's not correct. Your

Honor.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LARSON:

When did you first file that?
The second amended complaint was

19

filed after the summer of 1980, the June 1980 decision

20

by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LARSON:

23
24
25

That was after -That was one year before the

final order on the merits.
QUESTION:

But it was after the decision of

the supreme court of the state.

ME. LARSON;

1

That’s correct, and that

2

nonetheless related back to — I mean, it was a motion

3

to file a second amended complaint, which was granted

4

and which relates back.
QUESTION;

5

But the point is, hadn't you

6

obtained all the relief you sought before you filed your

7

amended complaint?
MR. LARSON;

9

Not necessarily.

On

certification, the decision by the Rhode Island Supreme

Court is essentially an advisory opinion.

Now, there was never any injunction entered

14

against the Respondents directing compliance.

17

their compliance.

18

compliance would be obtained.

24
25

The defendants tried to get out of

QUESTION;

But was there a substantial issue

left after the decision of the state supreme court?
MR. LARSON;

The matter of compliance,

yes,

plus there was also the matter that on this record ir.

10

1

this case the state hearing officer decision was still

2

on the record in this case, and that plaintiffs had a

3

right to have that decision basically stricken or

4

recognized as not controlling, and that is indeed

5

something that happened in the final order.
QUESTION;

6

On the same point, I also fail to

7

understand what happened and why there was a year's

8

worth of litigation after the state supreme court issued

9

its ruling, which furnished the only basis for the

10

ultimate ruling in the federal court.
MR. LARSON;

11

It’s true. Justice O'Connor, that

12

a year in time passed.

There was not a year of

13

litigation.

14

opinion, the motion for amended complaint was filed.

15

That was granted shortly thereafter, basically in July.

10

The amended complaint was then actually filed in the

17

fall,

18

to he filed to complete the matter of relief in this

19

case.

Immediately after the state supreme court

and then we're into the winter,

During that period of time,

20

when motions began

the Petitioners

21

and the school committee worked out a consent decree,

22

basically, which included the award of attorney’s fees

23

against the school committee.

like further litigation might be necessary against the

The state, however, was

sure that it was going to go along, and it locked

MR. LARSON;

obtain it because the district court judge in his final

6

order said that, we don’t have to reach the federal law

7

issues because we -- I recognize, the district court

8

recognizes, the plaintiff has obtained the objective of

9

the lawsuit.
QUESTION;

10
11

MR. LARSON;

13

QUESTION;

17
18
19

They of course did not

You made two different types of due

That's correct.
One was against a local school

committee, and that was the basis of the original -MR. LARSON;

15
10

Well, basically the Petitioners

process claims during the course of the litigation.

12

14

Cn what, the fee?

Well, but that was also against

the —
QUESTION;

-- injunction, I guess, the

preliminary injunction.
MR. LARSON;

Yes, an injunction which was

20

continued also against the state after the state was

21

brought in.

22

QUESTION;

Yes, but that was really a

23

complaint concerning the termination of funding pending

24

resclu ticn of the dispute against the school committee.

25

MR. LARSON;

Well, no.

12

The termination of

1

Tommy’s education.
QUESTIONi

2
3

The funding for the child's

education.

4

HE. IARSCN;

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.
All right.

And then the second due

6

process claim was against the Respondents here and had

7

to do with their serving as hearing officers in your

8

dispute with the school board.
HR. LARSON:

9
10

claim,

challenging the bias in the process itself, yes.
QUESTION;

11
12

It was a Gibson v. Berryhill type

And no relief was granted under

that claim.
HR. LARSON:

13

That's correct.

But the first

14

claim;

the due process claim, equally runs against the

15

Respondents as well because of the modified preliminary

16

injunction that was subsequently entered after the

17

Respondents were in this case.
QUESTION:

18

Well, but didn’t the terms of the

19

preliminary injunction run only against the school

20

commit tee?
HR. LARSON;

21

Initially, yes.

But of course,

22

the state was involved in the funding of this process,

23

the state has the responsibility for enforcing state

24

law.

did it or not, in terms of

the words of the preliminary injunction?
MR. LARSON*

In the words of the preliminary

injunction, it’s only against the school board.
QUESTION*

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Well, you said a moment ago that it

ran initially only against the school.

I gathered from

your answer that perhaps later it was amended to run -MR. LARSON;

MR. LARSON;
QUESTION*
MR. LARSCN;

Yes.
Is that what you meant?
It was the -Could you answer the question?
Yes.

The original preliminary

injunction was directed solely against the school
committee, because indeed the Respondents had not yet
been sued, and the terms of the preliminary injunction
were to maintain Tommy in his educational program during
the pendency of the exhaustion of the administrative
proced ures.
Thereafter, it was extended because the

Justice O'Connor, I got the implication that at some

Well, the state defendants —
New, is that true or not?

Is that

correct or not?
MR. LARSON:

As Justice O'Connor pointed out,

it did not name the state in the injunction.

So it never did run in terms

against the state defendants?
MR. LARSON:

In that they were co-actors

responsible in this litigation —

MR. LARSON:

Were they named in the injunction?
No.
Mr. Larson, could I bring you back

to something you started off with, and

that was your

reference to Maher against Gagne.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Correct.
The First Circuit mentioned it once

in its opinion, as I recall.
MR. LARSON;

That’s correct.

look at it.
QUESTION:

16

and vacated the opinion and sent it back, would it be

17

open in remand for the application cf the Hensley

18

principles announced last term?

19

MR. LARSON:

The Hensley principles, even

20

pre-Hensley, were applied by the district court.

example, Justice O'Connor --

QUESTION:

23

25

For

Well, it doesn't appear to have

MR. LARSON:

Well, Justice O'Connor, you

referred to the fact that the substantive due process

claim with regard to the Gibson v. Berryhill issue was

2

not one on which claims prevailed.

3

deducted the fees or the time spent on that issue from

4

the fee award that was granted.

5

The district court

There is a type of Hensley issue still pending

6

in the First Circuit.

7

Hensley issue, but it has to do with whether or not the

8

time that was spent in the administrative proceeding and

9

the state court proceeding is correctly time which

10

I wouldn't really consider it a

11

That was not addressed by the First Circuit in

12

this appeal because of the way the First Circuit

13

disposed of the fee entitlement issue.

14

course, would be open on remand.

15

QUESTIONS

That issue, cf

Mr. Larson, I'm afraid we've not

18

given you much time to argue the case, but the point

17

that I asked you about before is central to my own

18

understanding of the case.

19

qu est i on.

20

Let me ask you one more

After your view had prevailed in the state

21

supreme court and you of course had to go back to the

22

district court because the questions had been certified

23

to the state court --

24

MB. LARSON:

25

QUESTIONS

That's correct.
-- did you ask the district court

2

state supreme court had not given you?

When you say a motion -— of impartiality --- a motion filed, was this ir your

8

complaint that had already been filed some time before,

9

or did you -- what did you request specifically when you

went back?
MR. LARSON:

11

We requested that the hearing

process itself be declared violative of due process

13

because cf interested persons acting as hearing

14

officers.

15

denied that.

16

We sought further relief on that and we were

That is in the complaint and it was part cf a

17

separate motion subsequent to the Rhode Island Supreme

18

Court’s decision.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

The district court, though, still

said that you had won everything you ever sought?
MR. LARSON:

There is no question that the

22

majcr issue in this case was Tommy’s education.

23

the district court was correct in its finding of fact

24

that plaintiffs had obtained the result sought, and I

25

think the First Circuit in its appeal on the merits was

18

I think

1

correct in also making that same finding of fact.
QUESTION;

2

And you did not file your 1983

claim until after/ according to the district court, you

4

had won everything the plaintiff sought?
MR. LARSON;

claim in the case.
QUESTION;

7
8

No, the 1983 claim was the first

Yes, but you've been paid for that

work.
MR. LARSON;

9

No.

I mean, the 1983 equal

10

protection claim, which the trial court found to be

11

substantial, is a claim that is encompassed within the

12

initial complaint that was filed, yes, against the

QUESTION;

17

Well,

why was it necessary, then,

18

for you to amend your complaint, the second amended

19

complaint?

20

MR. LARSON;

We

The first amended complaint added

21

the Education for All Handicapped Children Act claim,

22

because that had then become an effective federal law.

23

And the third amended complaint added the 50U claim.

24
25

QUESTION;

And when did you add the Section

19 8 8 claim ?

MB. LARSONi

The Section 1988 claim was in the

2

first amended complaint and also in the second amended

complaint.

5

was a boilerplate reguest for such further relief in the

6

first complaint, and that in the Court of Appeals has

7

been held as sufficient to encompass a request for

8

fees.

Section 1988 with regard to fees, as a
There

As I have stated, I believe that because of

9
10

the legislative history and because of the unanimous

11

decision by this Court in Maher v. Gagne, this case is

12

conclusively -- or it should be resolved in favor cf

13

Petitioners here.
QUESTION:

14

On that point, Mr. Larson,

the

15

Court didn't discuss, and I don’t believe the briefs do,

16

cases such as Erown against the GSA and Pryzer versus

17

Rodriquez, where this Court has said that a detailed

18

comprehensive statute precludes remedies under the

19

broader

MR. LARSON;

10

that statutory threshold of having prevailed without
ever receiving an adjudication on their constitutional
claim,

and this Court unanimously held that plaintiff,

because of the fact that she had raised a substantial
constitutional claim, was entitled to fees under Section
1988.

And the same result flows here, not only under

Section 1988 but also under Section 505.

want to explain a lit,tle bit of the history of this so

we see hew this case came into focus.
I want to point out here that I represent the

Commissioner of Education and not the local school

committee in this action.

MR. AVILA;

I think I see it all the time.

QUESTION;

12

Is this a Rhode Island expression?

9
10

What happened --

We've come across it in one other

case.
MR. AVILA;

13

I was not aware that it was an

14

unusual expression, Your Honor.

15

usual term for it.
QUESTION;

16
17
18

It's always been cur

You never find it in California,

anyway .
MR. AVILA;

In this case, long before the

19

Commissioner of Education became involved in it, what

20

happened was the local school committee agreed that the

21

child concerned should be placed at Bradley Psychiatric

22

Hospital, and so the school committee did that.

23

the school committee lcoked at the situation and

24

reevaluated it and made a determination that there was

25

another -- there was a state agency, the Rhode Island

25

Then

1

Department of Cental Health, that it felt under certain

2

statutes was responsible for this child’s -- or should

3

be responsible for educating or placing this child at

4

Bradley Hospital.

5

So the school committee told the parents that

6

the school committee was not going to fund that

7

placement, not going to provide any more funds for that

8

placement, which of course would result in that

9

placement being ended.

10

At that point what happened in the case was

11

the plaintiffs in this action filed a complaint in the

12

federal district court, and I don't believe that this

13

first complaint speaks of equal protection.

14

remember it correctly,

15

procedural due process, and more particularly, the basic

16

argument of this complaint was simply that Phode Island

17

regulations, Rhode Island special ed regulations, which

18

even though the Handicapped Act was not yet in effect

19

apparently we had some pre-knowledge of what these

20

regulations would lock like, sc it looks as if the

21

regulations we were using at the time really matched the

22

ultimate federal handicapped regulations.

If I

I think it solely speaks to

23

Under those regulations, a placement couldn’t

24

be changed unless the parents consented to it or unless

25

they were granted a hearing and as a result of that

26

1

hearing a change was ordered.

Well, what happened in

2

this case was the plaintiffs felt that they weren't

3

ccing tc be granted that hearing, even though they had

4

asked for it, so they filed the complaint in federal

5

district court.
The federal district court judge looked at the

6
7

complaint and he said, yes, under Rhode Island

8

regulations you have a right to a hearing before the

9

placement can be terminated, and this funding, potential

10

funding dispute between the state agencies was exactly

11

that sort of funding dispute or that sort of change in

12

placement dispute that should be adjudicated through the

13

available state administrative procedures.
So the federal judge issued a preliminary

14
15

injunction to keep the child at Bradley Hospital at the

18

expense of the school committee and then required the

17

school committee to conduct a due process hearing as

18

required by Rhode Island administrative special

19

education regulations, and also that opportunity should

20

be given the parties tc appeal to the Commissioner of

21

Education.
So that's what happened in this case, Your

22
23

Honors.

24

committee, an administrative sort of hearing.

25

There was a hearing before the local school
The

school committee took evidence and looked at the matter ,

27

1

and they resolved in a written decision that they were

2

nor responsible because a state agency was responsible.
That decision was then appealed to the

3
4

Ccnunis sioner of Education, who held a de novo hearing,

5

acting as a hearing officer, and listened to both

6

sides.
Now, the Rhode Island Supreme Court in a case

7

8

-- and by then, by the time the matter reaches the

9

Commissioner of Education, the Handicapped Children's

10

Act is in force.

And you'll note if you lock at the

11

record, one of the complaints the plaintiffs had against

12

the Commissioner, and an issue on which they lost, they

13

were arguing that he couldn't act as a hearing officer

14

under the Education for all Handicapped Children’s Act.

15

So there is no doubt here, the plaintiffs have even

10

agreed, that this was a hearing pursuant to the

17

Education for all Handicapped Children's Act at that

18

stage.
What happened was, the Commissioner heard the

19
20

matter.

21

indica ted at the time that this was a difficult gues tio n

22

and it

23

Commis sioner in the positio n of having to make his cwn

24

decisi on.

25

And the Rhode Island Supreme Court had

had not yet resolved the issue.

So that left the

So what the Commissioner did was, he found

28

1

that the Rhode Island Eepartment of Mental Health should

2

have been educating this child.

3

How, what happened after that was the plaintiffs

4

appealed the matter to federal district court.

5

took the matter up there, arguing that, no, it was net

6

the Department of Mental Health, but rather the schccl

7

committee, that should be responsible.

8

9

That was his decision.

They

New, with that Rhode Island Supreme Court
prior precedent that I mentioned, indicating that this

10

was a difficult issue, I was involved in the case at

11

that point and I suggested to the court that the matter,

12

the question, be certified to the Rhode Island Supreme

13

Court for a determination as tc who was responsible and

14

who wasn't.

15

came down with a decision indicating that, that in fact

16

the local school committee was responsible.

17

And so then the Rhode Island Supreme Court

So in this case I would suggest that what you

18

really have, it's not a normal special ed case.

19

you have is a state level hearing officer who heard a

20

case and he decided the case in a way that ultimately

21

was not — that was held to be wrong by the Rhode Island

22

Supreme Court.

23

Now, because he --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. AVILA:

What

As a matter of state law?
As a matter of state law, Your

29

1

Honor .
And the strange thing about -- I shouldn’t say

2
3

-- the interesting thing about this case, if you read

4

one of the later opinions of the district court in this

5

matter, he said — what finally happened in this case

6

was, once the Rhode Island Supreme Court rendered its

7

decision, which from my perspective ended it — I don’t

8

think you can presume that state agencies are not going

9

to follow their own supreme court.

Plaintiffs, though,

10

perhaps wishing to have some sort of order on the

11

record, looking forward to some sort of attorney's fees,

12

requested a declaratory judgment declaring that the

13

Commissioner's decision was wrong.

14

the point of doing that, other than trying to form a

15

basis for fees.

I still don’t knew

Now, the court ultimately entered that sort of

16
17

decision and declared, for whatever purpose, that the

18

Commissioner’s decision was wrong.

19

decision by the Commissioner of Education really taken

20

entirely, I would say, in essence in his judicial

21

capacity.

22

But that was a

And you'll note in one of the district court’s

23

opinions, the district court makes the point that it is

24

not ruling against the Commissioner -- and it uses these

25

words -- "on any basis that the Commissioner ever failed

30

1

tc enforce state lav or failed to see that state law was

2

carried cut."

3

No, the court rejected that, said that that

4

was not the reason.

5

acting in the case was because the Commissioner had

6

rendered this decision, and it gave the date for the

7

decisi on.

8
9

It said the reason why it was

So I would say there's no doubt that all we
have in this case is a pure Education for all

10

Handicapped Children's matter, where a hearing officer

acting under that Act has rendered a certain decision.

what he did.

No, Your Honor.

I would say that

it's not following state regulations.

failure to follow state regulations — and I don't know

require —

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Avila, why did the Court cf

12

Appeals not address the Maher versus Gagne type approach

13

and talk about the substantiality of the constitutional

14

claim and the meritorious nature of the statutory claim

15

under 504?

16

MR. AVILA:

Well,

I think, Your Honor, they do

17

mention that decision, and why they did not -- why they

18

did not follow it is simply this.

19

plaintiffs, as the Petitioners indicate, they are not—>

20

arguing that the Education for all Handicapped

21

Children's Act is enforceable under 1983.

22

would be the straightforward way to get fees, to argue

23

that it's enforceable under 1983 and therefore under

24

1988 you should get fees.

25

In this case, as the

What they did is, they said that

programs and provision of related services.

just don’t see how 1983 comes into play.
QUESTION:

I didn't think the Court cf

didn't hold that this Act precluded any parallel

remedies anywhere else.

They just said it precluded

attorney's fees.

That's the issue in the case.

ME. AVILA:

2

Well, what they were saying is

3

that the only reason why these constitutional claims

this;

Ycu could raise this sort of constitutional

issue, whatever it may have been — I don't think in my
mind it was ever, assuming that it existed, it was ever
that well articulated -- and there was no real way that
anyone could ever get at it.
I think that in the old Siler case this Court
established a rule about avoiding deciding
constitutional questions, and the purpose cf that rule
was because the Court for prudential reasons wanted to
turn away from deciding these issues, recognizing the
problems you get with constitutional constructions.
When you've got a state -- when you’ve get a
federal statute like the Handicapped Children's Act,
it's so wide-ranging, realistically no one is turning
away from deciding the difficult constitutional issue.
That's not really involved in the case.

Everyone's

attention is simply focused on the statute.
So that rules seems to be potentiating here

37

1

into something that it was never intended to involve,

2

the fee award question.

3

when the alleged 1983 constitutional claim is

4

coextensive with the Education for All Handicapped

5

Children's Act, we con't believe the 1988 fee provision

6

is applicable.
MB. AVILA;

7

What I'm suggesting is that

I also want to point cut briefly.

8

Your Honor, that we've raised the contention that the

9

Commissioner here is net liable for fees because he was

10

acting in a judicial capacity.

11

p o i nt.

I won't belabor that

I just want to point out that we would contend

12
13

that if administrative hearing officers are going tc be

put in

15

to have to pay fees depending upon how they decide the

16

case,

17

equal due process for anyone.

18

a position where they or their agencies are going

that's really not going tc contribute to fair and

Finally, Your Honors, I'd like to suggest that

19

this Court's recent decision in the Pennhurst case iray

20

have some applicability to this matter.

21

that this question was ultimately decided on state law

22

grounds, that decision suggests that perhaps the federal

23

district court shouldn't have gotten involved in the

24

matter in the first place, at least in relation to the

25

Commissioner's decision.

38

To the extent

New, we have to concede that we're here cn a

1
2

motion for attorney's fees, but I would suggest that if

3

there's some Eleventh Amendment immunity applicable in

4

this case that it should be applicable even now on the

5

question of attorney's fees, because the effectiveness

6

of that ruling is best served by avoiding -- by

7

nullifying federal judicial actions, which in essence,

8

on the basis of a state court, state supreme court

9

decision, it just goes out of its way to reverse, fer nc

10

very good reason perhaps, a decision of an

11

administrative hearing officer.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E.

MR. LARSON;

in this case, the 504 claims and the constitutional
claims, were kind of back door claims to get attorney's
fees.

I respectfully disagree.
This is an exclusion case.

There could be no

stronger case for an equal protection claim on this
record.

The original complaint sought relief under the

Constitution in general, and it did specify due
process.

The subsequent complaints can all be read as

having, no question about it, an equal protection claim
in it.
The 504 claim is as substantial as a 504 claim

20
21

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

My adversary seemed to imply that the claims

can be.

This is, again, an exclusion case.

The

language of 504 bars exactly what happened in this case,
exclusion on the basis of handicap.
New, as attorneys representing the plaintiffs
we had the responsibility to allege net only substantial

40

claims, but claims which we believe we can win on.

No,

The fees were in

this case from the beginning to the extent that there

face of the initial complaint.

I should also point cut that the trial ccurt
here made as an ultimate finding of fact the finding

that the equal protection claim was substantial, and

that was deferred to -- a similar finding was deferred

There is no question that plaintiffs were
