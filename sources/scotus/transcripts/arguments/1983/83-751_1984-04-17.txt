ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GELLER:

6
7

may it please the Court.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

held in this case that the Securities and Exchange

10

Commission, and in effect every other government agency,

11

must provide to the so-called targets of its ncnpublic

12

investigations notice whenever it issues a subpoena to a

13

so-called third party.
We've sought certiorari because the Ninth

14
15

Circuit’s ruling is without any basis in the law,

16

conflicts with the decisions of this Court, and

17

threatens to impede law enforcement investigations by

18

the SEC and other administrative agencies.
The facts that give rise to this case car be

19
20

briefly stated.

In September 1980, the Commission

21

issued a formal order, authorizing its staff to begin a

22

private investigation into possible violations of the

23

securities laws in connection with certain mining

24

stocks.

25

formal

Several of the respondents were named in this
order.

3

1

During the course of the investigation, the

2

Commission staff issued subpoenas to the respondents and

3

several other people.

4

brought this suit to enjoin the investigation on the

5

grounds that the Commission's formal order was

6

defective, and that the staff was proceeding with the

7

investigation improperly.
Respondents also claimed that as the so-called

10

notified of all subpoenas issued to people other than

11

themselves during the course of the investigation.

held that respondents had available to them an adequate

ago, t he Court of Appeals r eversed as to the so- called

4

third party notice issue.

5

Appea 1 *s reasoning seems to be the following two

6

sen ten ces from its opinion, which are reprinted at page

7

7 a cf the Appendix to the G cvernment's petition,

8

last t wo sentences in the f irst paragraph on pag e 7a ,

9

the Si nth Circuit said, and I quote;

E ut, as I mentioned a metre nt

standa rds."

that t he target has the opp ortunity to assert th is

20

consis tently with the Powel 1 standards, "notice cf third

22

The Ninth Circuit therefore ordered th e

23

Commis sion to notify the ta rgets of its investig ation,

24

25

sub poe na to a third party.

And this is all appa rently

5

a

so that the target can bring some sort of legal

2

proceedings, to assure that the subpoena to the third

party complies with the Fowell standards.

4

New, one of the problems one has in analzying

5

the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case is that it

6

is not at all clear from the Court's short and somewhat

7

cryptic opinion, exactly what source of legal authority

8

the Court of Appeals thought it was relying on in

9

imposing this unprecedented notice requirement.

It

10

seems tolerably clear that the Court of Appeals was not

11

relying on any provision of the Constitution, and

12

respondents seem to concede as much.

13

Court's decision in cases such as Hannah v. Larche and

14

Fisher v. United States, United States v. Xiller , leave

15

little doubt that the Fourth and Fifth

16

give anyone a protectable interest in records held by

17

third parties, don't give anyone the right cr the

18

opportunity to challenge the validity of subpoenas for

19

records held by third parties.

20

I think this

Amendments don't

It also seems fairly clear from the Court cf

21

Appeals' opinion that it wasn’t relying on any expressed

22

provisions of the securities laws, because the statutes

23

that govern the SEC's issuance of subpoenas don't

24

contain any requirement that the Commission notify

25

so-called targets of its investigations each time it

6

1

issues a subpoena to a third party.

The fact is, I hope

2

to discuss in a few moments, when Congress has wanted tc

3

require the Commission to give notice of its subpoenas

4

to someone ether than a subpoena recipient, it has said

5

so expressly in carefully crafted legislation.

6

there is no legislation that requires that the

7

Commisison notify so-called targets when it issues

8

subpoenas to third parties.

But

And the Ninth Circuit’s sole reason for

9
10

imposing this novel third party notice requirement is

11

apparently based on its construction of this Court's

12

decision in United States against Powell.

13

moment ago, in reading from a portion of the Ninth

14

Circuit's decision, the Ninth Circuit seems to have

15

understood

16

targets of an agency's investigation to be investigated

17

consistently with the Powell standards.

18

extent that we can understand the Ninth Circuit's

19

reasoning, it seems to have concluded that notices tc

20

third parties is essential to protect this so-called

21

right to be investigated consistently with the Powell

22

standards, and this is so because in the Court of

23

Appeals' view, apparently, third party recipients of

24

subpoenas who are not targets of an agency's

25

investigation would not have standing tc suggest that

As I noted a

7

And to the

1

the subpoena somehow failed to satisfy the Powell

2

standards.

3

Now, there are a number of obvious flaws in

4

the Court of Appeals analysis.

5

of course, is that Powell has absolutely nothing at all

6

to do with how administrative agencies go about

7

conducting their investigations.

8

that if an agency can't get voluntary compliance with a

9

request for information, it has to make certain showings

The principal problem,

Powell simply holds

10

in order to get judicial enforcement of its subpoenas.

11

The purpose of this rule, as the Court noted in Powell,

12

is to protect the enforcement ccu.rt's own processes, not

13

to superintend investigations conducted by agencies.

14

And, contrary to the Court of Appeals*

15

somewhat puzzling assumption, which T think to some

16

extent underlies its whole notice requirement, it’s

17

quite clear that the recipient of an administrative

18

subpoena would have standing to insist on compliance

19

with the Powell standards,

But Powell only concerns the rights of

about the rights of third parties, much less anything

about requiring that third parties be given notice --

rather , targets be given notice when subpoenas are

issued to third parties.

Mr. Geller, are there any

Yes, yes.

QUESTION;

14

Mr. Geller, the Fowell case dealt

15

with the Internal Revenue Cede, and I know the Ninth

16

Circuit assumed — I guess there are some lower court

17

cases saying it applies to SEC investigations as well.

18

Do you agree with that view?

19

MR. GELLER;

To the extent that Powell

20

standard overlap Fourth Amendment standards set out in

21

cases like Oklahoma Press, and

22

they do, then, of course, the SEC would have to make the

23

same showing at a subpoena enforcement proceeding.
There are, however, certain elements of the

24
25

to a large extent I think

Powell

test, such as the third element, that the IPS not

11

1

already have the information in its possession, which I

2

think were simply construction of the Internal Revenue

3

Code,

4
5

and those —
QUESTION;

It really purports to be mainly a

construction of the statute, rather than --

6

NR. GEILER;

That’s correct.

And to that

7

extent, to the extent it is simply a construction cf the

8

statute, it would not apply to other agencies.

9

as I say, some of the elements of the Rowell test, such

10

as that the subpoena be issued for a legitimate purpose

11

and that it be relevant, seek relevant information, are,

12

I think, simply Fourth Amendment standards.

13

extent, of course, the SEC and other agencies would have

14

to meet it as well.

15

However,

And to that

So, to sum up, there is no constitutional

16

basis for the Court of Appeals' decision, and it didn’t

17

purport to identify one.

18

for the Court of Appeals’ decision, and it didn’t

19

purport to identify cne.

20

seems to be based on a plain misreading of the Powell

21

case in two respects;

22

so-called targets of an investigation, and

23

recipients of a subpoena who are not targets would

24

somehow not have standing to challenge the subpoena cn

grounds.

There is no statutory basis

The Court cf Appeals’ decision

(1) that Rowell grants rights to
(2) that

Both of these assumptions are plainly

inccrr ect
And, finally, the relief awarded here, which

2
3

is providing notice, seems plainly inconsistent with the

4

decision in Donaldson, which held that targets of

investigations don’t even have a right of intervention

in a pending judicial enforcement proceeding.

7

being

Ninth

That

sc, it seems inconceivable that they could have a

Circuit ordered here.
Now, I think it’s important to emphasize that

10
11

the issue presented in this case is of tremendous

12

concern to the SEC and other administrative agencies,

13

not simply because the Ninth Circuit’s decision is wrong

14

-- which it is -- and not simply because it would be

15

tremendously quite burdensome administratively to try to

16

apply

17

SEC often investigates transactions rather than

18

individuals, and it would be quite burdensome to try to

19

figure out who has to get notice.

20

concerns the government is that the Court of Appeals’

21

decision, the notice requirement, will severely impair

22

the ability of the SEC and ether agencies to conduct

23

effective law enforcement investigations.

It's not clear what a target is; the

And the reason for this are the reasons that

this Court has consistently explained in upholding the

need for secrecy in the Grand Jury.

12

cooperate with the SEC if they knew that their names

13

would immediately have to be given over to the targets,

14

the so-called targets of the investigation.

15

And, in addition, many people, especially

And I should add that this is not a

16

speculative or fanciful concern on the SEC's part.

In

17

the Wedbush case, which was a fcllow-up to this case in

18

the Ninth Circuit, the District Court ordered the SEC to

19

provide the targets of that investigation with the names

20

of subpoena recipients.

21

Ninth Circuit and specifically argued -- and this is on

22

page 28a of the Appendix to the Government's Petition --

23

specifically argued that some of the third party

24

witnesses had requested confidentiality, and the

25

disclosure of these witnesses to the target would impair

The SEC sought a stay from the

14

1

2

the effectiveness of the investigation.
Despite this, the Ninth Circuit summarily

3

denied a stay in Wedbush and ordered the SEC to provide

4

the so-called targets cf that investigation, with the

5

names of third party subpoena recipients.

6

Finally, providing notice would tremendously

7

increase the opportunities for delay in conducting a r.

8

investigation, and would prejudice the privacy rights of

9

people called to testify or produce evidence in the

10

investigaticn.

11

These consequences are important, we believe,

12

because Congress could not possibly have intended them,

13

at least without expressly saying so.

14

out earlier, there's no provision of the securities laws

15

that requires this sort of notice, and in this regard,

16

it's extremely significant that Congress has enacted

17

legislation that dees,

18

require the SEC and other agencies to give notice to

19

certain types of people when subpoenas have been served

20

on third parties.

21

And, as I pointed

in very limited circumstances,

Section 21h of the Securities Exchange Act

22

incorporates the Eight to Financial Privacy Act, which

23

was passed by Congress in 1978.

24

Financial Privacy Act creates a limited exception to

25

this rule by providing that the SEC and other agencies

15

And the Right to

1

have to give customers of banks notice when

2

administrative agencies serve subpoenas on banks fcr the

3

private records of

these customers.

4

Now, I think the enactment of Section 21h and

5

the Right to Financial Privacy Act is very instructive,

6

for two reasons.

7

knows hew to provide fcr a notice requirement when it

8

wants to do so.

9

Right to Financial Privacy Act leave no doubt that

First, it shows that Congress clearly

And the debates on Section 21h in the

10

Congress thought, when it was enacting those statutes,

11

that there was no sort of requirement in the law

12

previous to that point, such as the Ninth Circuit seems

13

to have discovered in this case.
And secondly, I think the enactment of Section

14
15

21h is quite instructive, because when Congress did

16

impose a notice requirement, it quickly surrounded that

17

requirement with a number o f P rotections designed to

18

prevent, the sort of harms t hat I was discussing a few

19

moments age.

20

ruling does not contain any of these protections, nor

21

could it.

22

A nd,

We think

needless to say, the Ninth Circuit’s

what all of this shows is that the

23

Ninth Circuit’s ruling represents nothing more than that

24

court’s notion of what constitutes sound public policy,

25

and even if the Court of Appeals were right in that

16

1

judgment, and we doubt that it was, it was not a

2

judgment that the Court of Appeals was entitled to

3

make.

4

requirement that the SEC or other agencies give notice

5

to the so-called targets of its investigations, and

6

therefore the Ccurt cf Appeals had no power to order it.

7

We think what this Ccurt said only a few weeks

is extremely relevant

There, the Court said, this kind of policy

10

choice, restricting agency investigative power, is best

11

left to the legislative Branch.

12

If there are no further questions, I'd like to

13

reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT CF WILLIAM D. SYMMES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SYMMES:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
I’d like to divide my argument, with the

20

Court's permission, into two parts.

21

to address the Ninth Circuit's opinion, why it's

22

correct, why we believe it should be upheld, and

23

secondly, respond to counsel's argument, in that order.

24
25

First, I would like

This Court, back in 1964, handed dcwn the
Reisman decision.

The Reisman decision essentially said

17

1

four things.

2

agency investigation has a remedy for unlawful subpoenas

3

or for agency subpoenas which have been issued in excess

4

of or in abuse of statutory authority.

5

specifically was not limited just to the recipient of

6

agency process.

7

not only may the recipient intervene, but also any party

8

who is affected by the agency process.

9

Firstly, it said that a target of any

That case

The language cf that case stated that

The Reisman decision went on to say that the

10

remedy for this situation is the opportunity to

11

intervene, the opportunity to intervene in the subpoena

12

enforcement action that would occur in order to enforce

13

the third party subpoenas.

14

this is very important — to say in the Reisman case,

15

that to preserve that remedy of intervention, the

16

affected person may seek a restraining order to restrain

17

the compliance of the third party witness with the

18

outstanding subpoenas, pending hearing at the subpoena

19

enforcement hearing.

20

very important — the Reisman case said was that, at

21

this subpoena enforcement hearing, the recipient or the

22

target, the person affected by the outstanding subpoena,

23

whether it be the target or the recipient, may challenge

24

the subpoena or summons, the administrative summons or

granted, it’s permissive; we don't say it's absolute --

8

in order for such a target or affected person to not

9

only intervene, to obtain a restraining order, and

And

10

challenge the subpoena on appropriate grounds, that

11

affected person or target must be aware of the

12

outstanding process in which he has a protectable

13

interest, if the subpoena seeks information that's net

14

legitimate to the purpose of the investigation, or if it

15

seeks information of documents which are not relevant to

16

that purpose, or if in the conduct of investigation the

17

agency

is violating its own rules.
Therefore, the Ninth Circuit concluded that in

18
19

order for the target or affected person under Peisman

20

and Powell to intervene, to challenge, to get a

21

restraining order, in order to do this he must have

22

notice.

MR. SYMMES;

Not my reading.

I think

Donaldson, Your Honor, clarified Reisman and Fowell

2

clarified that intervention exists, net as a matter of

right; it’s a permissive intervention.

that it's permissive intervention doesn't rule out,

But the fact

How do you respond to the Solicitor

is reguired.

QUESTION:

No.

But if — I think the

19

Solicitor General's argument is that if Donaldson only

20

went as far as it did in allowing permissive

21

intervention, a requirement of notice on top of

22

permitting intervention goes even further, and that

23

Donaldson would have had to go further as to

24

intervention before you'd even think about notice.

25

MR. SYMMESs

Cur answer would be simply this;

21

1

that under Donaldson or Powell or F.eisman, a target

2

doesn’t even have the opportunity to intervene, can’t

3

even exercise, if you’ll forgive the phrase, permissive

4

intervention unless he knows about the outstanding

saying is, Donaldson at least held there was permissive

20

totally illusory, and I’ll tell you what happened and

21

why, and what the Ninth Circuit had in mind.

22

Permissive intervention as applied to
It’s

When we were at the District Court level, the

23

Court held that the targets, O'Brien and Magnuson, had

24

an adequate remedy at law to challenge the subpoenas

25

issued

to them, Magnuson and C'Erien.

22

The adequate

1

remedy at law was found in Reisman.

The adequate remedy

2

consists of intervention and the opportunity to

3

challenge on any recognized grounds, specifically the

4

Powell grounds, those subpoenas.
After the Court handed down its ruling, the

5
6

SEC brought no subpoena enforcement action.

Instead

7

what happened is, many, many third party subpoenas were

8

issued; that is to say, subpoenas issued to third

9

parties seeking, in some cases, the very same

10

information, in other cases, tc the extent that it came

11

to our light, other or additional information which we

12

believe were not legitimate to the purpose of the

13

investigation or relevant; and in the process of doing

14

so, avoided the opportunity, prevented us, precluded us,

15

preempted us from the opportunity that Reisman said that

16

a target or affected person would have.

17

the opportunity to intervene and obtain judicial

18

scrutiny of the outstanding subpoenas.

3

please let me know, and that the broker could

MR. SYMMES;

First of all, in this case, there

4

were — at least to our knowledge -- over 60 third party

5

subpoenas served.

6

QUESTION:

Well, they might all call you up.

7

I mean you might well do business only with people who

8

are willing to give you notice if there's a subpoena

9

like this served.

10
11

Why isn't that an adequate protection

for most third party relationships?
MR. SYMMES:

The reason why it's not adequate

12

protection — and I may be begging the question, if I

13

understand your question -- the reason why it's not

14

adequate protection is because the third party doesn't

15

have any incentive whatever to disclose to the target

16

the fact that there's an outstanding subpoena --

17

QUESTION:

If he wants to retain your

18

business, I don't suppose he's going to be too happy

19

with his -- too popular with his customers if he doesn't

20

tell them about things like this.

21

MR. SYMMES:

But not all third parties are

22

brokers or dealers.

Net all third parties are persons

23

who are friendly to the target, and therefore would not

24

have the incentive.

25

QUESTION:

Well,

those who are unfriendly

2U

1

might well respond to an inquiry without a subpoena.

2

And you get no notice of that.
MR. SYMKES:

3

I agree.

If the SEC, in the

4

course of conducting an informal investigation, chooses

5

not to issue subpoenas, it can talk to whomever it wants

6

and, presumably, about whatever it wants, even if that

7

information they seek is beyond the scope of the formal

8

order of investigation which is issued by the Commission

9

to the

staff and authorizes them to proceed.
We may want to challenge that.

10

That's net an

11

issue before this Court, and there's no practical way to

12

monitor that.

13

and I think this is a point that may be lest on this

14

argument, at least so far -- Congress has specifically

15

placed

16

Commission in the course of issuing subpoenas and the

17

enforcement of the same, by not allowing those subpoenas

18

to be self-enfcrcing or self-executing, and as a result,

19

has put the courts squarely in the middle.

What the Congress has done, however --

the courts between the Securities and Exchange

And what we're asking that this Court do is to

20

affirm

22

that a logical extension of Reisman is to provide the

notice necessary to allow us tc intervene..

several things.

First of all, delay to the extent you

may call that -- and I would put it in quotes — a

to the extent that if someone doesn't comply voluntarily

that the courts are well-situated -- we argued this in

they certainly can be met.

2

Your argument is basically that they're not likely tc be

3

urged upon the court by the recipient.

MB. SYXMESs

They're not likely to be urged on

5

the court, and as a practical matter, most people who

6

are the recipients of such subpoenas are not in a

7

position to do so.

8

itself, is so strong -- fail not at your peril, you must

9

do this — subject tc fines — I realize the courts

The subpoena itself, the form

10

haven't imposed that -- but the subpoena is so strong

11

and so demanding and sc official that even if a

12

recipient might be inclined to do so, he has no

13

incentive whatever based on the subpoena alone.

14

So for those reasons, we believe that the

15

Powell standards could only be met by a target having

16

the oppcrtunity to intervene, and only by intervention

17

can he assert those rights, and he needs notice in order

18

to intervene.

19

And that's our position.

And I think that what we must not forget is

20

that this Supreme Court in Reisman said that a target,

21

one affected by a subpcena, has a protectable interest

22

in not having information or documents disclosed or

23

revealed by a third party in response tc a subpcena

24

that's not lawful or issued in excess or abuse of

25

statutory authority, or thus in violation of the Powell

38

1

standa rds.

And if Resiman is correct, and if we do have

2

pro tec table interest, then as a target we ought to be

3

able t o intervene, and we need notice to intervene --

4

becaus e, as I pointed cut in this case, there were

5

subpoe nas outstanding and being responded to by third

6

partie s before Magnuson and C’Brien were ever even

7

a wa re ,

were ever even aware that there was a formal

8

order

investigation cr any investigation of any kind

9

pen din g against them.

10

Thank you.
