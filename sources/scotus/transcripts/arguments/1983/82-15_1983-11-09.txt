ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER OLIVER

field.

That motion was sustained.

A panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed.

On

petition for rehearing en banc the Sixth Circuit held

15

that the per se open fields doctrine permitted the state

16

police to conduct the open field search, and that

17

holding by th=> Sixth Circuit was contrary to the

18

position of.seven other circuits who have rejected the

several hundred yards to his house and then continue

officers after finding this marijuana they came back out

7

and while traveling on the road they saw Mr. Oliver and

8

ultimately arrested him and charged him with

manufacturing and proving marijuana in violation of the

10

federal statute that was involved.

11

and many cases before the Katz case was that searches

approval by a magistrate were per se unreasonable

that since Oliver excluded the public — the

19

distinctions we will make in a moment -- this was not an

HR. HADDAD.-

Do, sir.

2

The definition of open fields has changed

3

through the years.

4

polic=> could search in an area from which they are not

5

exclud ed.
There are other views of Hester holding that

6
7

it is a per se open fields doctrine.
QUESTION:

10

In Hester the Court held that the

Do we know that much about the

facts in Fester, Hr. Haddad?

It is just that very kind

of conclusory statement in Justice Holmes' opinion.
MR. HADDAD:

11

Yes, sir.

I think that you are

12

correct in that, hut there was a holding there or some-

13

holding to the effect that the defendant himself is who

14

led the police to the evidence by passing the jugs cf

15

whiskey to the other person that was on the property at

16

the time which the officers were able to observe.

17

also held in that case that there were ether people who

18

came onto and off of the property even while the

19

officers were there and after the arrest had been made.

So we next come to the Clmstead case about

20
21

four years later when there was a holding that has been

22

referred to as the per se locational theory, and that

23

was that anything outside of the curtilage was

24

considered to be an open field and no warrant was

25

needed.

In the Katz decision this Court rejected the

/

1

Clmstsad*s per se theory of the open field doctrine, and

2

in more recent cases since Katz the holding has been

3

that a field is not open if the public was excluded.

4

In the Air Pollution Variance Board v.

Western

5

Alfalfa case decided in 1974 the Court analyzed

that a

6

federal agent can trespass onto an area where the public

7

is not excluded and view that which was exposed

to the

8

public without violating the Fourth Amendment.

So they

9

held that if the public was not excluded the area was an

10

open field, and in that case they held, which was an

11

OSKA warrantless search case, they held that the search

12

was okay and legal.

13

In Marshall v. Barlow a few years later, some

14

four years later, this Court using the same analysis

15

held that without a warrant the government agent is in

10

no better position that a member of the public and

17

observations capable of being made by the public can be

18

made by the agent without a warrant.

19

Court held as unconstitutional the authorization under

20

the 0554A Act or search without a warrant because it

21

permitted a warrantless government agent to search in an

22

area where the public was excluded.

23

In that case the

So we get into that fine distinction that this

24

Court has made that if the public was excluded the area

25

is not an open field.

If the area is not an open field

then the Fourth Amendment applies.
If the Fourth Amendment applies then we must

3

use the 'two-part Katz test to determine if the Fourth

4

Amendment has been violated.

5

part of the Katz test which is was there an expectation

6

of privacy we find in this particular case that this man

7

had his property fenced.

When we look at the first

He had it posted throughout with Ko

He had a gate to the road which had

area through wooded areas to find the marijuana growing

in the corn field.

There was a travel back into

There was also the additional, which the Sixth

15

Circuit dissenting opinion put a lot of weight upon —

16

There was also the additional fact that somebody on

17

property had hollered to the police officers that no

18

hunting was allowed and to come hack or to come hack, no

19

hunting was allowed.

So when we apply that and as the District

21

Court judge said in his memorandum -- opinion, short of

guards at the entrance it is difficult to see what else

the defendant could have done to assert his privacy

interest in the property —

not necessarily mean that the owner wishes to exclude

QUESTION;

Well,

then what comfort do you draw

from the additional conversation about hunting?

HR. HADDAD:

13

None except that I felt that —

The Sixth Circuit dissenting opinion felt that that was

It said No Trespassing?

something added to show that there was an expectation of

It means just what it says, no trespassing,

sign to give you an expectation of privacy apparently it

What you are saying is that a field

1

can have some expectationcf privacy, but in no event

2

would it acguira the expectation of privacy that you

3

would have in a house because of the different treatment

4

of what is seen in plain view from outside the field.

5

MR. HADDADs

Exactly.

I think that is where

your Hester case comes back into play, and it would

QUESTION;

What difference does it make that

this could have been seen from the air?
MR. HADDAD;

Well, it does not make any

14

difference at all in this case because if it can be seen

15

and the air searches have been held legal because the

16

air is a place where the public is expected to be

They then radio down to the police car that is stopped

go right on into the corn field?
MR. HADDAD:

17

May the police then

Well, I think, they would have a

18

right at that point under the open fields doctrine

19

because any member of the public could do the same

20

thing, could fly around in the air in a helicopter and

21

observe that.

We say that it is.

Certainly society is ready

to accept as reasonable a farmer's right to exclude

MS. ZEEGERS;

18

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
In State of Maine v. Richard Thornton

17

the area

18

in question was not as a ma tter of fact akin to an open

19

field.

20

wooded area was not akin to an open field.

21

The area by its ver y nature of being a heavily

It was not a field for one thing, and it was

22

not open in any sense of the word.

If you will look at

23

the information in this case starting from the affidavit

24

by the police officer after he had made his warrantless

25

search they made reference to an informant here who had

16

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

told, about marijuana growing in back of someone’s
trailer home in a heavily wooded area.
The police officer said in the affidavit as
well that he went to the heavily wooded area and saw
what he wanted to see and then asked the magistrate to
give him a search warrant tc search the heavily wooded
area.

Also at the suppression hearing it is very clear

from the record that the area searched was in fact woods
and not fields.
There were photographs.

An aerial photograph

in particular showed that the complete property except
for some very small patches, smaller than this table,
were in fact open.

The rest of it was a completely

heavily wooded area.
The police themselves made testimony that the
area that they searched was heavily wooded.

Krs.

Thornton's testimony, the defendant's wife’s testimony,
was also that the area was heavily wooded.
Therefore, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine
should be free as a matter of fact to determine that the
nature of the particular area was not an open field.

It

was in fact closed woods and secluded woods.
QUESTION!

Then let me take you back to the

questions we were putting to your colleague about a
helicopter or a light plane flyina over the area taking

say about that?

5

v

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, my

6

feeling on that would he that if they made an aerial

7

search that may have been enough to establish probable

8

cause to get a search warrant.

9

may have been difficult to in fact observe marijuana

Well, in my situation it

10

growing because the patches were so small in this

11

heavily wooded area.

12

they might have been able to see them.

13

Perhaps if they had binoculars

But if it were a large area and they were

14

easily seen, then that would have been enough to

16

establish probable cause.

not a privacy violation from the air to the extent of

17

the privacy violation of police actually coming onto

your property.

13

Well, Mr. Justice Eehnquist, I

14

do feel that there is adequate and independent state

15

grounds for this decision, and the reason that I am

saying that is because the State of Maine had to talk

my position that the court had to discuss Hester and

Katz because those were the cases that were raised by

the Petitioner on appeal so they had to discuss them,

but then they said we are in accord in determining

whether or not there was a search.

Then the court cited

MR. MOSS:

Mr. Moss.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Fourth Amendment protection does not apply to

20

Mr. Thornton's woods because any subjected expectation

21

of privacy he entertained in his woods was unreasonable

22

as a matter of Fourth Amendment law.

23

But the intent here is to protect

14

an underlying core zone of privacy which is essential

15

QUESTION;

17

But don’t you think that there is

18

substantial property law involved in determining whether

19

there is this expectation of privacy or not?
MR. MOSS;

20

There can be property law

involved.

forth certain examples as to what would constitute that

Acting on information that

Petitioner was growing marijuana on his farm police

drove up a road onto the farm.
When a gate which contained a No Trespassing

6
7

sign blocked that road they continued unobstructed on

8

foot on a frequently used path around the gate and then

9

down the road until they reached the marijuana field.

10

It is not disputed that the marijuana was not discovered

11

until the officers were on Petitioner’s property, but it

12

is well settled that that fact alone does not require

13

suppression on Fourth Amendment grounds.

14

The notion that somehow the area was

particularly secluded and that there was dense

It is our position that Fourth Amendment

25

and to create an expectation of privacy in these areas

/
44

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

that the Court might disagree and the Court might take
the view that there should be some Fourth Amendment
protection for those areas.
In that event it is still our position that
these areas can never have the sort of protection that
is granted by the warrant clause and the probable cause
requirement and at a minimum the police must be able to
enter when they have reasonable suspicion.

I think that

that position only makes common sense — The
consequences of enforcing the warrant clause
requirements here are just — There are just too many
cases where any balancing of Fourth Amendment values
would suggest that the police ought to be able to enter
and they would not be able to enter.
There are cases cited in the briefs where kids
have gone onto the fields to hunt or fish or something
and come back and report to the police that there is a
marijuana patch growing or something that might be a
marijuana patch growing.

It just does not make any

sense that the policeman cannot follow these kids back
onto the yard where they had just been unless he has
probable cause and a warrant.
QUESTION s

There is no restriction at all.

That is what worries me.

You say that a police officer

can go on anybody's land at any time under any

that.
HR. HOROWITZ:

You certainly cannot mean

First of all, there is

certainly a practical restriction.

5

QUESTION:

That xs what I mean.

6

HR. HOROWITZ:

Hut I do not think it is a

7

restriction that is constitutionally required.

There is

8

a practical restriction in that the police do not -- I

9

do not know how many trillions and trillions of acres of

\

10

open fields in this country.

The police do not have

11

time to go tramping through them.
In almost all the cases you see cited

12

13

involving the open fields doctrine the police only go on

14

the fields because they have a reason because someone

15

has suggested to them.

16

for that.

17

So there is a built in safeguard

I do not think the Fourth Amendment itself

18

extends any protection to these areas.

If the warrant

clause applied here and even if the police had gotten

20

some tip, let's say something that does not amount to

probable cause.

You need a warrant

I think that illustrates why fields are so

20

probable cause to go into a house is because the Fourth

22

interests that individuals have.

The facts in Hester are that the police knew that

from this one.

13

I think the Court's decision there reflects a

14

common sense understanding that these sorts of places

15

are not really in a practical sense restricted from

16

outsiders and if people are going to do things in these

may make an unjustified intrusion into a private area if

25

police get a warrant on probable cause.

In some not insignificant percentage of these

1
2

cases their suspicion is going to turn out to be

3

unfounded, and they are going to make an intrusion into

4

the home that invades serious privacy interests and that

5

is not warranted by law enforcement interests.

6

the reason we have the warrant and probable cause

7

requirement to minimize those entries as much as

8

possib le.

That is

Now in the case of a field it just does not

9
10

make sense to have the same sort of requirements because

11

there is very little privacy value in what goes on in a

12

field.

13

matters that the Fourth Amendment was intended to be

14

directed at when they are out in their fields.

People just do not engage in the sort of private

So let's assume the police go onto a field

15
16

with less suspicion.

let's say they have only 5 percent

17

reason to think that there is marijuana in the field and

18

in 95 percent of the entries they turn out to be wrong,

19

but in

20

anything except cows and corn and trees.

those 95 percent of the entries they do not see

21

It does not really matter so it just does not

22

make sense to erect this kind of barrier which is going

23

to have a serious impact on lav enforcement to protect

24

what is basically a theoretical privacy interest or one

25

that is going to exist in only very unusual cases.

I

1

would also like to talk briefly about looking at this

2

case from the standpoint of the land owner.
I think the facts in this case are not very

3

4

strong for an expectation of privacy.

The police walked

5

directly onto the field without any barrier.
The idea that the No Trespassing sign somehow

6
7

creatas a significant expectation of privacy I think

8

just does not accord with reality.

this case was that there was a No Trespassing sign when

Ms. Zeegers, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT CF DONNA L. ZEEGERS, ESQ.,

6

OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT THORNTON
MS. ZEEGERS:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The core area analysis set forth by the State

10

of Maine in that a core area and the house are the only

11

areas subject to Fourth Amendment right is a theory that

12

was specifically rejected by United States v. Chadwick

13

and upheld by other cases in this Court.

14

by the State that people would be able to buy land and

15

fence it and grow marijuana any way they want to without

16

the police being able to do anything about it, of

17

course, has no merit because the police can get a search

18

warrant as they have in the past and as they will in the

19

future.

The contention

20

In terms of the body or kidnap victim being on

21

the premises certainly the police would be able to go in

22

without a warrant because those circumstances have been

23

held to be exigent circumstances in state courts as well

24

as in federal courts.

25

I would like to take a look at the policy

reasons which do not justify abandonment of the Fourth

favor of a per se exception.
QUESTIONS

to open fields.

6

isn’t it?

This Court has never extended that

That is what is at issue in this case

MS. EEEGERS:

7

Well# in terms of the per se

8

exception this Court# of course, has never extended that

9

to open fields# but if you look, at the reasons for the

10

exception to the warrant requirement that this Court has

11

upheld

12

to preserve the safety of police officers# to prevent

13

the loss or destruction of evidence or in the special

14

nature of a government interest such as inventory

15

sea rch es .

we have seen that they have been in the context

We have seen hot pursuit, exigent

16
17

circum stances# automobile searches, searches incident tp

18

an area surrounding a lawful arrest, the search of a

19

border, the consent search#

20

course# these are none of the situations presented in

21

this case.

22

the stop and frisk.

Cf

It is important to note -that the possibility

23

for police abuse is manifest if we adopted a per se

24

exception because we would need no probable cause.

25

would allow indiscriminate searches by police to

We

1

continually hope to find evidence of a crime instead of

2

the general rule that all warrantless searches are per

3

se unreasonable except for a few carefully guarded

4

except ions.
The bright line rule proposed by Petitioner in

6

e

this case will alter that general rule to the extent

7

that all warrantless searches are per se reasonable

8

except those searches of houses and the core area.

9

I would have to say is not in keeping with the spirit

10

This

nor the letter of the Constitution.
It is important to note in this case that

11

12

there was clearly a subjective expectation of privacy

13

which

14

was reasonable.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you one question.

It

15

isn't very often that sensitive constitutional questions

16

can be resolved by use of modern technology, but did I

17

understand you to indicate that if a helicopter or a

18

light plane went over and took one of these very

19

sensitive pictures concluslively showing that it was

20

marijuana and took that to the magistrate that a warrant

21

could properly issue?

22

MS. ZEEGERSi

That would be one factor which

23

might be enough to establish probable cause.

I mean it

24

would depend on certainly the person taking and

25

examining the picture whether they would have the

)

v

expertise to determine from the air whether that was

2

marijuana -QUESTION;

3

Assume all that.

The magistrate

4

himself if you want or at least a prosecuting attorney

5

takes the pictures, supervises them and they are

6

unquestioned.

7

it?
MS. ZEEGERS:

8
9
10

Now that is enough to get a warrant is

Certainly the case law has said

that and I have not heard any constitutional arguments
that have said that that is not the correct analysis.
QUESTION

11

There is another proposition

12

announced in a good many opinions that the knowledge of

13

one officer involved in an operation is the knowledge of

14

all.

15

MS. ZEEGERS;

16

QUESTION;

Yes.

I take Justice White’s

17

hypothetical.

The man in the light airplane or

18

helicopter is an expert on foliage and he says this is

19

marijuana, and they radio that down to the officers who

20

then move in without a warrant.

21

MS. ZEEGERS;

22

QUESTION;

23

No.

I see.

Is that okay?

That would not be okay.
I just wanted to clarify

your position.

24

MS. ZEEGERS;

Eight.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Thank you, gentlemen.
