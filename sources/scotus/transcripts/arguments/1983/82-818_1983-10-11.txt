ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

10

NR. WALLACE;

Thank you, Nr. Chief Justice,

11

and may it please the Court, the consolidated cases

12

involving the same Chapter 11 debtor in possession, the

13

Court of Appeals in this case prescribed a standard to

14

be used by a bankruptcy court in determining whether to

15

approve an application to reject a collective bargaining

16

agreement as an executory contract, and how that

17

approval of such rejection operates retroactively to

18

deprive employees of rights under the contract during

19

the entire post-bankruptcy petition period, and thus to

20

deprive the National Labor Relations Board of.authority

21

to remedy 'as an unfair labor practice the debtor in

22

possession’s unilateral departure from the contractually

23

prescribed terms and conditions of employment durina the

24

post-petition, pre-rejection period.

25

We believe the court of app-als erred in both

1

respects.

2

reserve a little time, because much can happen during

3

the ensuing 45,

4

think are the governing principles, and why our position

5

best accommodates the two federal statutes involved and

6

maximizes the effectiveness of each.

Because I have only 15 minutes, and hope to

all I can try to do is summarize what we

All the courts of appeals that have considered

7
8

the guestion have agreed, and the respondent in this

9

Court does not dispute that a special standard must

10

govern

rejection of a collective bargaining agreement.

11

This is partly because of the special nature of such an

12

agreement, as prescribing a code of industrial conduct,

13

and because the employees, unlike others, are totally

14

dependent for their livelihood on their relation with

15

the employer.
But the basic reason is because of a statutory

16
17

conflict between the application to a collective

18

bargaining agreement of the bankruptcy court’s authority

19

to set

20

Relations Act's prohibition of mid-term modification or

21

termination of a collective bargaining agreement unless

22

both parties to the acreement agree .

23

aside an executory contract and the labor

QUESTION*

Mr. Wallace, is it so much a

24

conflict between two statutes as a problem of executory

25

contracts of a different character, one with a supplier.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

perhaps, and one with an employee?

2

conflict in the statutes?
MR. WALLACES

3

Is that really

Well, the Labor Act does say

4

that there cannot be midterm rejection or modification,

5

termination or modification of a labor contract, of a

6

collective baroaininq agreement, unless both parties

7

agree pursuant to prescribed procedures, and yet there

8

is reason to think that the authority of the bankruptcy

9

court to set aside executory contracts does extend to

10

collective bargaining agreements.
On the face of the statutes, they do look in

11
12

opposite directions, and Congress has not explicitly

13

said how this conflict should be resolved, but as we

14

explain in our brief, we' believe it implicitly ratified

15

the resolution that had been developed by the Court of

16

Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was the only

17

appellate decision at the time Congress enacted the

18

Bankruptcy Code, and Congress did indicate some

19

awareness of those decisions.

20

QUESTION;

21
22

How did Congress indicate, that

awaren ess?
MR. WALLACE:

In legislative history of prior

23

amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, but not in the

24

legislative history of the cede itself, but because the

25

same Committees dealt with —

QUESTION:

1

Well, then, what is it you rely on

2

to say that they implicitly ratified a court of appeals

3

decision?

4

HR. WALLACE:

Hell, just the general principle

5

that Congress is presumed to he aware of how the law has

6

developed, but —

7

QUESTION:

Now, wait a minute, Mr. Wallace.

8

Is there any general principle that Congress is presumed

9

to be aware of every district court, every court of

10

appeals decision, or every decision of this Court,

11

however episodic it may be?

12

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we relied basically on the

13

Lorillard case, which refers to that principle, but cur

14

main argument is that in any event, the Second Circuit's

15

resolution is the proper one, regardless cf whether it

16

can be said that Congress implicitly ratified it, and

17

under that standard

18

QUESTION:

—
We really have three separate

19

standards expressed by the courts of appeals, don’t we,

20

this one, the Migra case, and the Eleventh, and —

.

MR» WALLACE;

Well, and Judge Mansfield's

3

opinion in REA Express for the Second Circuit.

We dc

4

think that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is very close

5

to that.

6

it, it does say in another passage that it thinks that a

7

factor that the Second Circuit says is essential is

8

going to be an important inquiry in many, many

9

instances.

Although it explicitly says it disagrees with

The case will turn on that.

And that is the

10

inquiry whether rejection of the collective bargaining

11

agreement is necessary to avoid collapse of the business

12

as necessary to tne preservation of the viability of the

13

busine ss.

14

This, we believe, should be the central

15

inquiry, because for one thing it is a question that is

16

properly within the competency of a bankruptcy court to

17

determine, unlike the kind of second guessing of the

18

collective bargaining process that otherwise is

19

suggested in opinions about balancing the equities to

20

determine whether terms and conditions of employment

21

other than those bargained for would be fairer under the

22

circum stances to both the employees and the employer,

23

and to take into account what is the likelihood that a

24

strike might be provoked if the collective bargaining

25

agreement is set aside, the kinds of inquiries that

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Congress, as this Court has emphasized, has left to the

2

bargaining process and the parties themselves, and has

3

prohibited even experts in labor manaaement relations,

4

such as the Labor Board, from second guessing the

5

bargaining process with respect to, and the kind of

6

inquiries that it is difficult to conceive of Congress

7

asking a bankruptcy court to resolve.

8

9

And while the standard focusing on preservatin
of the business, its viability, thus would preserve the

10

basic policy of the Bankruptcy Act, it would also

11

maximize preservation of rights under the Labor Act by

12

reducing only to a risk of error in the resolution cf

13

that question the preservation of rights that otherwise

14

would survive under the labor contract, and by making it

15

less apt that the bankruptcy court's decision will

16

provoke a work stoppage because of unacceptability to

17

the employees who have been operating under the contract

18

if they perceive that the question that has teen

19

answered is whether their contract rights can survive in

20

any event, and that has been the inquiry.

21

'It also puts in the proper context for

22

bankruptcy court resolution such emotional matters as

23

evidence of anti-union animus that may have motivated

24

the employer to go into bankruptcy.

25

court by and large should regard that as going to the

13

A vendor, for example, obligated to provide

14

lumber or potatoes or what have you, is prohibited by

15

the bankruptcy law from terminating the contract merely

because the other party goes into bankruptcy, and the

obvious meaning of that is that as he continues to

2

entitled to while they were performing those services,

3

and the mere fact that there may be reason to ask the

4

court to set aside further obligations under a

5

collective bargaining agreement does not provide a

6

reason to treat employees operating under that agreement

any differently. If anything, it brings in

considerations of the Labor Act as well.
I would like to reserve the balance of my

ORAL ARGUMENT GF JAMES R. ZAZZALI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL 408, IET, ETC.

14
15

Very well.

SR. ZAZZALI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16

please the Court, I adopt the position of the Solicitor

17

General with respect to the standard issue, and instead

18

I would move on to the subject of 8(D), which is the

19

requirement in. the National Labor Relations Act which

20

compels a party seeking to modify or terminate, a

21

contract t'o give notice to and to negotiate with the

22

other party.

23

precedent to the rejection of a union contract, because

24

we think 8(D) is in the public interest as a public

25

statute designed to protect the common weal.

We think that 8(D) should be a condition

*

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

We are only asking tor purposes of this

2

discussion that not ail of the trappings and the

3

trimmings of 8(D) be superimposed upon the employer cr

4

the union.

5

to and to negotiate with the other party to that

6

contract before the contract is automatically rejected

7

ipso facto.
If the employer refuses to come to an

8
9

Father, we simply ask a party to give notice

agreement, and mind you that we have never suggested

10

that concessions must be made by the employer, but if

11

the renegotiations do not work out, or if the union

12

simply refuses to negotiate, the employer is then free

13

to seek rejection of the contract in the bankruptcy

14

court, and Justice O'Connor, in response to your

15

question, we do indeed agree with the Solicitor General

16

that generally a labor contract is an executory contract

17

which may be, in appropriate circumstances, subject to

18

the correct standard, be rejected.
But again, as a legitimate and viable

19

20

condition precedent to that rejection, we think there

21

should be "negotiations.

proposal.

23

It is designed, above all, to again protect the public

24

interest and to pay due respect to the Bankruptcy Code,

25

and to the interests and to the rights of employers who

QUESTIONS

6

You think, though, that they must

comply literally with all the requirements of 8(D)?
ME. ZAZZALIi

7

I think in terms of the policy

8

considerations here, because there are multiple

9

requirements, I don't think so, Justice White.

I think — I think --

amount of bargaining?

Is that it?

ME. ZAZZALIs

No, it is in negotiations.

16

Obviously, we would like to see notice to the Federal

17

Mediation and Conciliation Service,

which is mandated,

18

notice to the state agencies, but I

think in an

19

appropriate exercise of discretion these requirements

20

can be dispensed.

21

responsibility, to use the vernacular, is to get the

22

parties together in the public interest to bang cut an

urge that --

QUESTION:

It seems the key — the key.

HR. ZAZZALI;

lour Honor, I can appreciate the

5

concern about time.

6

made by some of the parties to the briefs and some of

7

the amici in the case.

8

this is not the Railway Labor Act, which has a complex

9

and convoluted series of requirements for negotiations.
QUESTION;

10
11

It is a suggestion that has been

We would note, Number One, that

No, but I gather, Nr.

would require them to bargain to impasse, would you not?

14

NR. ZAZZALI;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, but impasse —

That can be a long time.
It can be —

I gather your position is, they

16

must bargain to impasse before the debtor in possession

17

may seek rejection.
NR. ZAZZALI;

18

That's correct, but given the

19

exigencies of the particular situation, that is,

20

bankruptcy, and given the responsibility of both parties

21

and, we hope, the maturity of both parties, impasse can

22

be in two weeks, it can be achieved in two days, it can

23

be achieved in two hours.
QUESTION;

24
25

It could be achieved in six months,

too.

UR. ZAZZALIi

That's correct, but I think it

is appropriate for the bankruptcy court in a proper

exercise of its discretion to perhaps order an expedited

negotiation schedule.
QUESTION!

6

There are —
If the union has notice, and surely

7

it would, of an application to reject the collective

8

bargaining agreement, the union could certainly

participate in the hearing, couldn't it?

is something considerably different than negotiations.

It may be.

Eut what

— what if the — what if the standard is as high

5

as you would like it to be, the standard for rejection?

6

You can -- you can assume that standard, and if the

union can get in its two bits worth as to whether that

8

standard is satisfied, why aren't -- why isn't that

9

enough?

UR. ZAZZALIi

2

'QUESTION!

Because I don't --

Because if the court were going to

22

conclude that, yes, the company would or would be likely

23

to fail unless there were modifications, why would you

24

have to go off and negotiate some more about it?

25

HR. ZAZZALIi

Because as we understand the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

bankruptcy court’s determination, it is an all or none

2

decision by the bankruptcy court to terminate or net to

3

terminate, to reject all parts of that collective

4

agreement or none at all, to reject the non-monetary as

5

well as the monetary benefits.

6

QUESTIONS

Well, does that requirement, does

7

that suggest that even if they arrived at an agreement,

8

even if they did, the bankruptcy court could still

9

perhaps even sui sponte direct rejection?

10

MR. ZAZZALIi

I can conceive of that

11

happening, but of course, sui spente, the court in an

12

exercise of its discretion — it might well be an abuse

13

of discretion --

14
15
16

QUESTIONS

The court, in other words, would

not be concluded by the agreement?
MR. ZAZZALIi

Absolutely net, but going back

17

to Justice White's inquiry, it's too late by the time we

18

get to bankruptcy court to have a hearing on rejection

19

to negotiate out the problems.

20

more sense to have the parties sit down, discuss,

20

the distressing aspect of this case is that some of the

The difficulty with so much of this is that

rather than reconciling the two statutes in favor cf

Justice Stevens, that we really aim towards some kind of

a sensible accommodation of the conflicting statutes.
It is interestincr that the employers are

QUESTION*

That’s correct, but —

And if the debtor in possession

refused to bargain with the majority representative of

its employees, I would suppose it would commit an unfair

labor practice, wouldn’t it?

HR. ZAZZALIs

That’s correct. Your Honor, but

7

keep in mind that the contract has not only been

8

rejected, but every part of that contract is being

9

rejected, including seniority provisions, and therefore

10

what will happen is what is happening, according to the

11

documented cases, and employees are being laid off and

the union is losing its majority.

In closing, I thank Your Honors, and would

MR. ZACKIN;

Then they wouldn't be bankrupt.
Well, that's correct, Justice

10

Rehnguist, and if they tried to use Chapter

11

increase their profits by rejecting the union contract,

12

that would constitute bad faith, and I think in

situation not only would the application to reject the

There is an implicit good faith requirement in the

QUESTION:

Well, is there something over and

2

above the good faith requirement that extends across the

3

beard to consideration of executory contracts by the

4

debtor in possession that applies to labor contracts in

5

particular, or is a labor contract protected by no mere

6

than the requirement of good faith that you have just

7

spoken of, which I think, extends across the board in

8

executory contracts?
HE. ZACKIN:

9

I believe that it does extend

10

across the board, Justice Kehnquist.

11

you look at the specific provisions of the Bankruptcy

12

Code itself, there is certainly no indication that

13

Congress intended collective bargaining agreements tc be

14

treated differently than any other executory contract.

15

I think that what the Third Circuit recognized was that

16

there are competing policies, as expressed in the

17

national labor laws, and that in order to accommodate

18

those policies, a special standard should be adopted so

19

that the rights of organized labor enjoy a special

status .

that Congress thought an employee was aoing into

bankruptcy at midterm and rejecting the contract.
ME. ZACKINj

3

That’s correct, Justice

4

Rehnquist, but I think it is important to note that

5

Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code did provide for

6

one specific exception with respect to the rejection of

7

labor agreements, and that is Section 1167 of the

8

Bankruptcy Code, which applies to collective bargaining

9

agreements negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, and

10

in that case Congress saw fit to say to the bankruptcy

11

courts, you may not, you may not modify or terminate

12

this contract except if the debtor complies with

'I think that Congress recognized that there

so-called new entity theory, but they wound up adopting,

-- or formulated by the Third Circuit, which is the

19

balancing approach, as well as the Third Circuit's

20

conclusion that a debtor in possession need net comply

21

with Section 8(D) of the National Labor Relations Act.

suspends the enforcement of the contract.
QUESTION;

I think what 365 stands for is, and the

But what the Third Circuit also

said,

and which we also agree with, is that once a

QUESTION!

May I ask, and this is prompted by

13

Mr. Wallace's closing remarks, what standard applies to

14

the compensation of the employees during that interval?

15

What frame of reference should govern?

16

MB. ZACKINi

I think that if the contract is

17

rejected, then the employees are entitled to the

18

reasonable value of their services which they render in

19

that interim period, and I think that that is not a

20

difficult calculation to make.

21

look to wh'at the standards in that industry are in the

22

particular geographical area and determine what were the

23

reasonable value of the services provided by those

24

employees, and if they have not been paid that

25

reasonable value,

I think the courts can

we concede that they are entitled to

reasonable value and what they were actually paid.

QUESTION;

Would you agree that the contracts,

the collective bargaining agreement is strong evidence

of the reasonable value?
SE. ZACKINt

7

I think it may be in certain

8

instances, but it also may not be indicative if in fact

9

the economic situation of the employer has changed, has

10

deteriorated to the point where he can no longer

11

legitimately pay the compensation required in the

12

collective bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

13

Well,

wculd there be any room fcr

14

any bargaining over what is reasonable value under your

15

approach ?

16

WR. ZACKINt

I think that if we got to the

point where the labor agreement is rejected, there would

be bargaining in the sense of there may be settlement

discussions.

by the employees or by the union on behalf of. the

that under the Third Circuit's test, the debtor in

9

Relations Act.

It is required to barcain.

It must sit

10

down, if requested by the union, and bargain over new

11

terms and conditions.

12

the union is forced tc sit back forever and wait until

13

the debtor decides whether it wants tc assume or reject

the contract.

You indicated that there was some

20

difference between the successor doctrine and the new

21

entity doctrine, and certainly there is, tut I think

22

where the successorship principles make sense in this

23

context is in the sense that a debtor in possession

24

should be free to set the initial terms and conditions

of employment, which is not to say that he does not then

QUESTION;

But ordinarily, outside of

bankruptcy, a successor employer can't unilaterally

modify the wages.

SR. ZACKIN;

Well, I think that -- I think

7

that this case, as I read it, as I read what this Court

did in

9

necessarily bound by the terms and conditions of its

the Byrnes case, said that a successor is not

to say that it doesn't have the obligation to bargain in

I don’t believe so, Justice

when one analyzes it.

the burden is still on the debtor to show that the

It is really a twofold,shewing

Number One, the debtor must show as

1

to everyone else involved in the reorganization

2

process.

3

I think, that that in itself is quite a

4

stringent standard, especially in the absence of any

5

suggestion in the Bankruptcy Code that collective

6

bargaining agreements are to be treated differently than

7

any other type of executory contract.

8

types of executory contracts, the so-called business

9

judgment test, of course, is applied, and

Under all other

that is simply

10

a requirement that the debtor show that rejection of the

11

contract would benefit the estate.

12

I suggest that any time a debtor in possession

13

moves to reject a contract, it is going to be able to

14

show that, at least in the majority of the cases, or it

15

wouldn't be seeking to reject.

10

benefit to the estate concept, which doesn’t give any

17

import whatsoever to the harm to the non-debtor party to

focus attention in collective bargaining agreements on

20

the harm to the non-debtor party, in this case the union

21

employees,’ and consider what the potential impact of

22

rejection is going to be cn those employees.

23

But in place of that

I think that in itself is quite a leap forward

24

from the business judgment test, and it is quite a bit

25

of a more stringent showing which must be made.

If I might in the time remaining address

myself to some of the arguments which have been made in

opposition to the new entity theory, what we have is a

criticism that — of the theory on the grounds that

5

since management and operations and work force of a

possession is more properly deemed as the alter ego cf a

I suggest that the Second and Third Circuits,

HR. ZACKIN;
