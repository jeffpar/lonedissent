CHIEF JUSTICE BUFCEFi

Nr. Popofsky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF K. LAURENCE POPCFS.K Y, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. POPOFSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here because we believe that the Ninth

8

Circuit fundamentally misconceived the background,

9

history and purposes of the statute enacted in 1980, and

10

as a consequence also misconceived the congressional

11

solution to the problem of the northwest region.

12

would like to dwell just a brief moment on the history

13

because I think it is instructive of how the preference

14

problem fits into the congressional solution.

15

I

Under the Bonneville Project Act of 1937

16

Bonneville was authorized to serve all classes of

17

customers with power.

18

included not only those who were accorded statutory

19

preference and priority but also utilities, which were

20

privately owned and which had no such a priority,

21

federal agencies and my clients, the DSI’s, the Direct

22

Service Industries, which are principally aluminum

23

companies operating in the northwest.

24
25

Those classes of customers

Now the service tc the aluminum companies, to
the DSI’s has certain characteristics which are

3

1

important as we move into the congressional

2

consiierations in 19B0.

3

that the load is interruptable.

Among those considerations are

Unlike most industries or indeed most

4

5

utilities it is possible without absolute and complete

6

harm to operations to stop electricity, at least for

7

short times, on an immediate basis in order to protect

8

service to other customers.

9

the character of the DSI load it is also possible to

At the same time because of

10

serve that load with what is called nonfirm energy,

11

essentially energy, the production of which cannot be

12

guaranteed based on historic water conditions.

13

As a consequence, over the years the DSI load

14

was conceived by Bonneville has having unique values to

15

the northwest in the form of providing reserves to

16

protect firm power loads by others.

17

problem with the system as it existed in the thirties,

18

fourties and fifties, and that is that water was

19

finite .

There was only one

20

Dams were built on all acceptable locations,

21

environmentally acceptable locations, and by the early

22

1970's

23

amount of power being generated by Bonneville would run

24

out.

25

statute was triggered.

all the best estimates were that the finite

That is where the preference clause of the 1937

First, went the private utilities.

Their

2

contracts expired in 1973.

3

5

In 1975 and

fill service to them was

1976 the DSI's were advised that

6

their contracts which had been in existence since the

7

early sixties would when they expired most likely not be

8

renewed, again because of the existence of the

9

preference clause.

The consequence was and the picture

10

which emerged was that the only power that would be

11

available would go to preference customers, preference

12

utilities alone, and that that would be inadequate.

13

But the anomcly was that the Bonneville

14

Project Act of 1937 was intended to serve consumers and

15

farmers in the region and yet only a portion of the

16

region was served by the preference utilities.

17

I believe you will see ' in the record that Oregon was

18

generally not served by preference utilities whereas

19

Washington was largely served by preference utilities

20

and the disparity in rates that emerged in the seventies

21

caused, needless to say, a considerable political

22

problem in the northwest.

23

The fact

What happened in sum was that preference

24

emerged as the problem, not an adequate solution to the

25

problems of the northwest.

The only solution that was

c

1

possible was congressional, and that is why the statute

2

was enacted in 1980.

3

Now the statute ended what was called a

4

regional civil war, and it ended it in a manner which we

5

think is straightforward.

6

element of legislation that the power which was to be

7

available would be legislatively allocated, not

8

allocated administratively.

9

It decreed as its first

Priority and preference, the old preference

10

clause after all, was a congressional direction to the

11

administrator giving him instructions as to how he, the

12

administrator, should allocate power.

13

preference clause does.

14

allcca tions.

15

That is what the

It governs administrative

The heart of a statute in

1980 was to take the

16

allocation function away from the administrator and

17

legislate it directly by statute.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

Mr. Popofsky, do we find this heart

of the statute in any one section or subsection?
MR. POPCFSKY;

We do not find it in any one

21

section of the 85 pages of legislation, but I believe

22

you will find it mostly in section 5 where the sales to

23

classes of customers are mandated, and that is the key.

24

Justice Rehnquist.

25

administrator is mandated directly by Congress to enter

You will see in section 5 that the

6

1

into contracts, the terms of which are specified.
Now historically the preference clause has

2
3

always honored the existence of contracts.

Contracts

4

could be performed in accordance with their terms

5

without an invasion by a preference customer so long as

6

they had been validly entered into in the first

7

instan ce.
What Congress was doing in mandating contracts

8
9

for all four classes of customers, for the preference

10

customers, the privates, for the federals and directly

11

for the DST's, what Congress was doing was saying, we

12

mandate directly by statute this amount of power -- we

13

will come to that, of course -- this amount of power for

14

these classes of customers.

15

mandating more power than Bonneville has.

16

that.

Now we know that we are
We know

17

The answer to that is we will also authorize

18

Bonneville for the first time to acquire the resources

19

necessary to serve these contracts, and then we will do

20

one more remarkable thing so there can be no doubt and

21

no dispute.

22

will write a fiction right into the statute which says

23

the administrator shall be deemed to have sufficient

24

power to enter into these contracts.

25

In 5(g)(7) we will create a fiction.

QUESTION;

8

That is correct.

What is it in section 5 that

mandates the allocation that you describe?

9

MR. P0P0FSKY;

If you look further into

Your Honor,

For example,

I am working in the statute.

(b)(38)(5)(g)( 1 ).

QUESTION;

(5)(g)(1)

is on page 3 of the

petition for certiorari.
MR. P0P0FSKY;

I was also referring to the

appendix to the petition.
But in (5)(g)(1)

there is a mandate that the.

21

administrator shall commence negotiations.

In

22

(5) (d) ( 1) (b ) , the crucial provision, after the effective

23

date of this Act, the administrator shall offer — it is

24

mandatory language — in accordance with subsection (g)

25

of this section to each existing DSI contract, etc.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Indeed if you look at the legislative

1

2

hearings, the committee reports they are described

3

throughout as required, mandated contracts.

4

it is because of the character that they are mandated

5

directly by Congress that section

6

can be read to subsist with them in accordance with its

7

t e r ms .

(5)(a) of the statute

(5)(a) applies to all power, all power which

is not subject to a valid and lawful contract, and a

lawful initial contract are those specified as

11

mandated by the statute.

12

But, Mr. Fopofsky,

13

say that.

14

it says all power sales under this Act.

15

make any exception.

Perhaps it should maybe by implication, but

MR. PCPOFSXYi

16

(5)(a) does not

It does net

I agree, Your Honor.

It

17

absolutely says that, and the only question, therefore,

18

before the Court is hew does one reconcile a mandate by

19

Congress, a congressional allocation, if you will, of

20

power with the flat statement in (5)(a) that all sales

21

are subject to preference.

22

Honor,

23

The answer to that, Your

is plain.
Preference has never, has never required the

24

invasion or invalidation of a lawful, valid contract.

25

For example, in the 1970's the clients that I represent,

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the DSI’s, had lawful contracts which were going to

2

expire in 1981 to

3

1991.

There was not adequate power by 1976, and yet

4

nobody suggested that because if there was now an

5

insufficiency of power that these contracts were in any

6

way invadable.

7

notwithstanding the coexistence of a preference right.

8

9

They were valid according to their terms

Preference attaches only at the time of the
offer of a new contract to competing applicants, and

here Congress preempted the process.

16

ME. P0P0FSKY*

Yes.

Under the preference

clauses of various statutes as they have been

18

interpreted throughout the federal courts, preference

19

attaches as a directive to the administrator under a

20

statute who is marketing federal power.

the time when the administrator has power for sale and

22

announces that and there are competing applicants.

23

It attaches at

If among the competing applicants, for

24

example, a preference utility on the one hand and a DST

25

on the other, both applied and there was not enough

govern and direct the administrator to serve the

preference agency.

If there was sufficient power for

into that contract, goes ahead and enters into that

11

has ever held he has a right to invade an existing

entered into.

14

in the statute a requirement that in the contracts for

15

the private utilities there is a five-year pull back

16

clause to protect the preference notion that after five

17

years if power has become insufficient for any reason

18

those contracts can be interrupted by direction of

19

Congre ss.

20

It is for that very reason you will find

That is the historic functioning of the

preference clause and why section (5)(a) can coexist in

a cohasive and integrated legislative scheme with the

mandated contracts of our clients.

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

NR. GANZFRIEB:

I'r. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The government’s argument boils down to two

5

6

points I would like to stress this morning:

first, that

7

the Bonneville administrator’s decision fully accords

8

with expressed statutory directive and with

9

congressional intent, and that alone should suffice to

10

reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision.

Our second point

11

is that even if other interpretations of the Act are

12

possible that the administrator's decision is a

13

reasonable one and is, therefore, entitled to

14

substantial deference.
I am not going to spend much time putting the

15
16

Regional Act in perspective.

17

done that.

I think Nr. Popofsky has

18

I would like to emphasize only that at the

19

time that the Act was under consideration the region

20

faced

21

shortage, uncertainty in planning for the future, and a

22

great disparity in rates paid by consumers.

23

needed and what was recognized as the solution to this

24

was a legislative plan of allocation, and for this the

25

region

three pressing concerns:

an impending power

What was

turned to Congress.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) S28-0300

The Act that Congress passed was a careful

1

2

balance of interdependent factors.

In the end the

3

competing interests that addressed Congress arrived at a

4

compromise, and in this compromise all customers derived

5

benefits and all were required to make concessions in

6

order that the common good in planning for power could

7

be served.
Now in this proceeding the Respondents are

8

9

seeking to upset that balance, and they are trying to dc

10

that by preserving the enormous benefits they got in the

11

Regional Act while rejecting the tradeoffs that they had

12

to make.

13

are highly technical and complex, but the legal issues

14

in the case are straightforward and relatively simple.

Obviously the statute and its subject matter

15

In our view they are easily believed under

16

well established rules of statutory construction and

17

administrative law.

18

expressed directive of section

19

Regional Act that Bonneville shall offer to each

20

existing DSI an initial long-term contract that provides

21

for an amount of power equivalent to that which such

22

customers are entitled under its 1975 contract.

23

25

QUESTIONS

The key to the case is the
(5)(d)(1)(B) in the

May I interrupt right there with

just one question?
MR. GANZFRIEDs

Surely.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) S28-0300

QUESTION:

1

Under your view of the issue in the

2

case if your side wins will the DSI customers get the

3

same or a greater amount of power than they would have

4

gotten under the prior law?
ME. GANZFRIED:

5

6

same amount of power?
QUESTION:

7
8

They would be entitled to the

Would they not get a little more

because they have an additional protection?
MR. GANZFRIED:

9

Well, they have an additional

10

protection as to the first quartile.

They have less

11

protection as to the second quartile,

and what I would

12

have to do, and I am net in a position to do that, is to

13

predict which set of circumstances, namely, those that

14

trigger first quartile interruptions or those that

15

trigger second quartile interruptions would be the mere

16

likely

17

to occur.
In Congress* view it was likely that the

18

amount of power actually received, the energy received

19

by the DSI's, would go up, and I believe that the DSI's

20

reply brief addresses that in reference to the comments

21

in tha Senate committee report indicating Congress'

22

expectation that the energy received would go up to

23

between 85 and 96 percent of the total contract load,

24

which was somewhat more than they had actually received

25

under the 1975 contracts.

So your answer is that Congress

2

thought it would be higher, but you are not sure they

3

were right.
HR. GANZFRIEDs

6

higher.

Congress thought it would be

Now, that was their determination —
QUESTION*

Is it correct that if we take your

7

opponent’s interpretation of the law they would get the

8

same amount of power?

9

HR. GANZFRIED*

Nell, not necessarily because

10

what would happen under the Respondents’ view of the

11

case, as I understand it, is that the total entitlement

12

to power would be — I might add under what I understand

13

is the Ninth Circuit’s view of the case -- the total

14

entitlement to power for the DSI’s is not the full

16

contract load, not what is specified in the '75

16

contracts as the amount of power, but rather

17

three-quarters of that because as the Ninth Circuit

18

believed it was only three-quarters of that that had

19

been allocated.

20

21
22

QUESTION*

It is a right to three-quarters and

a possibility of more.
MR. GANZFRIEE*

Well, but that is not the way

23

the *75 contracts work.

The '75 contracts indicated in

24

section 4 — that is at page N-2 of the appendix to the

25

petition — that the amount of power that is sold is the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

full amount, the full contract load.

Those were the

2

figures that were before Congress when it was

3

considering the Regional Act.
Sow I might also add that the questions as to

4
5

interruption do not appear in section 4 of the 1975

6

contracts, but rather they are elsewhere.

7

power is clearly the full amount and was clearly

8

understood by everyone to be the full contract load.

The amount of

On this question of the amount of power, in

9
10

our view what we were required to do was to offer a

11

contract that provided an amount of power equivalent to

12

the amount they were entitled to in 1975, and as you can

13

see from the chart on page 20 of the joint appendix we

14

have dene precisely that.
We offered new contracts for the same amount

15
16

of power that the DSI’s were entitled to before, and in

17

our view there is really nothing else that need be

18

addressed in this case.

19

entitle the DSI’s to no greater amount of power

20

Bonneville clearly followed an express and specific

21

statutory command.

Since the 1981 contracts

Unfortunately the Ninth Circuit in its initial

22

23

opinion did not even address this issue, amount of

24

power.

25

at page 65 of the joint appendix, it specifically

In footnote 9 of its original opinion, which is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

declined to decide whether the new contracts involved a

2

greater amount of power than the old ones.

3

It was wrong for the court to do that.

The

4

issue had to be addressed, and eventually when the court

5

did address it in its amended opinion it added footnote

6

4 that says, in effect, the '75 contracts never entitled

7

the DSI*s to the top quartile and, therefore, the new

8

contracts can do no more.

9

The point is that that is wrong.

As I

10

indicated, section 4 of the '75 contracts specified an

11

amount of power, and it was the full amount.

12

because the top quartile was subject to interruption

13

which is something that happens under a different

14

section of those contracts, the court concluded that the

15

DSI*s are now entitled to -- are limited to the same

16

terms of service as they were before.

17

How

What it did'was it confused the notion of

18

amount of power and terms of service,

19

to point cut why that is wrong.

20

Regional Act is to the contrary, and the House Commerce

21

report makes clear at page D-123 of the appendix to the

22

petition that section 5(d)(1) refers to the amount of

23

power to which the DSI’s were entitled and not to the

24

amount that happened to be used at a particular time.

25

and I would like

First of all, the

In addition, there were tables that were

listing what the DSI entitlement was and what Congress

2

understood it to be, and these figures in the House and

3

the Sanate reports are references to the full contract

4

load under the 1975 contracts.

5

also ignored was the clear congressional directive that

What the Ninth Circuit

Now that language "as if it were firm" is from

10

the Senate committee report at page F-74 of the appendix

11

to the petition.

12

that this was the congressional plan and said so in

13

footnote 7 of its opinion it did not understand the

14

significance of the plan.

15

While the Ninth Circuit acknowledged

Instead it dismissed the committee reports as

16

ambiguous and meaningless, but the Court of Appeals

17

really made no effort to understand what those reports

18

were about, and in particular the court made no

19

reference to section 5(f) of the Act, another provision

20

dealing with the question of when the preference

21

customers are entitled to assert that preference.

Now even if the question of the quality cf

Your position just is not that the

statute is construable one way cr another and that

Bonneville chose one of the reasonable courses and that

4

we should defer.

That is not your point.

HR. GANZFRIED;

Our first argument is that

there was only one way it could be done, and it was done

7

that way and it was the way that Congress was told it

8

would be done.

9

If I am wrong about that and there is

10

to do what it did, it was certainly a reasonable reading

of the statute for the administrator to do what he

readable either way, but that it just preferred another

2

reading .

3

HR. GANZFRIED*

What it did was it focused on

4

the preference clause.

Its original opinion spoke only

5

of the preference clause and did not address the amount

6

of power issue.
There was really no way for this case to be

7
8

decided without the amount of power issue beina decided

9

for reasons I think you suggest in your question.

If we

10

did what we were expressly told to do, we complied with

11

the statute and other provisions would have to be put

12

into harmony with the specific directive we followed.
If we violated the specific directive of

13
14

5(d)(1)(E) then the provisions of this contract would be

15

invalid, not because of a preference claim but because

16

we violated the specific prevision telling us what we

17

were to offer to the DSI’s.
I would just like to add one other comment to

18
19

what the Ninth Circuit had to say that supports our view

20

in the case is that the Ninth Circuit had to say at page

21

13 cf its opinion in the appendix to the petition under

Bonneville’s construction all of its customers would

because of the interdependency and the need to sell to

7

The solution was not, as Petitioners would

The solution as Senator Henry Jackson, the

8

sponsor of the bill, said was simply to bake a bigger

9

pie and for the first time give Bonneville the authority

10

to acquire resources.

In fact, I believe the statement

11

is, the Act will give Bonneville the authority to buy

12

power to serve nonpreference customers without offending

13

the principles of preference.

14

That is what is unique about this statute.

15

That is why it passed after four years of discussion

18

with the regional consensus.

17

Now the answer to the question posed, did

language of the Act, two provisions, one of which

20

Justice Stevens has already referred to.

There is

no place in the legislative history where they asked to

QUESTION*

That is

What about the provision of the

21

statute — I do not have it in mind — that says the

22

power shall be deemed to be firm power for the purpose

23

of their contract?

24

*R. WALDRON*

That was as they described it a

legal fiction that said that there could not be a law

suit initially if Bonneville had not been able tc buy

2

enough resources to serve them.

3

with that because Bonneville also had short-term

4

purchase authority.

There was no problem

This was a provision that the aluminum

5
6

companies authored that some outsider could not come in

7

and say, Bonneville, you cannot enter into 20-year

8

contracts because you have not acquired the resources

9

yet.

10

What are you selling?
They had short-term authority to sell them

11

over the first few years, and then they needed to

12

acquire the resources.

13

prevent that challenge.

14

So it was a legal fiction to

When we are talking also about the legislative

15

history, and again I refer to the Act as being clear, I

16

think the most instructive piece of legislative history

17

is when the BPA administrator testified before Congress,- .

18

before Senator Jackson on the final hearing of the bill

19

that become this Act.

20

I am not going to repeat it, but the emphasis there is

21

the BPA administrator informed Congres that this

22

priority was expressly to be protected and that we were

23

to have first call on the federal base system, which is

24

what produces the nonfirm,

25

in this priority.

We have quoted it at length, and

authorized these reserve provisions described them as

providing reserves to the administrator for his firm

The court in the Ninth Circuit in Port of

I would also like to emphasize a point I male

2

earlier regarding its importance to us.

This power —

3

again the ratio is perhaps 30 to 100, but this nonfirm

4

power we use first of all when our reservoirs are

5

depleted, when we are not sure we can serve our firm

6

loads because it has not rained on our side of the

7

mountains; secondly, when we have scheduled

8

maintenance; — we schedule our maintenance of our plant

9

when we can have available EPA nonfirm service.

thirdly, when we have a forced outage.

13

put that 1,000 unit load ahead of us we can almost rely

14

upon their being small amounts, even in a drought year,

15

of EPA nonfirm that can protect our firm load when we

16

need it.

When a plant

Their reading is inconsistent with the plain

11

Nr. Waldron, do you think the Ninth

Do you

17

think the Ninth Circuit opinion was a good

MR. WALDRON;

Yes.

The reason I do. Justice

18

Rehnquist, is if you look at the Ninth Circuit opinion

19

it begins by saying the priority is clear.

20

5(a) and 10(c) has kept that priority, and that is as

21

far as we need to go.

had no priority under their 1975 contracts.

3

QUESTION:

And that the material treated in

4

the footnote 4 should not have been in the text at all.

5

It was just a footnote type of item?
NR. WALDRON:

6

I am not obviously going to

7

comment on how they write an opinion, but,

yes, it

8

should have been in a footnote because the opinion says

9

that the priority is clear and that, therefore, we do

10

not have to go beyond the priority to the equivalent

11

amount of power.

12

time they ever emphasized it was in the petition for

13

rehearing and rehearing en banc — when they raised that

14

at that time then the Ninth Circuit added

15

which basically summarizes it and says they are tied to

their entitlement under their 1975 contracts, and under

those contracts they had no entitlement to this nonfirm

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. LAURENCE POPOFSKY, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL
HR. POPOFSKY;

13

Let me start with the

14

observation that the statute nowhere uses the concept of

15

firm power and nowhere uses the concept nonfirm power.

16

The assumption that somehow everything Congress was

17

doing took those separate concepts into mind as a

18

statutory matter, preference for one but not for the

19

other,

20

imagin ation.

21

is, I think, a figment of the other side's

What Congress mandated was contracts for an

22

amount of power, 5(b)(1)(B), for our clients, that is,

a

23

concept of load capacity, not load usage, but load

24

capacity, and it was the same amount of load capacity as

25

existed in the then extent ESI contracts.

Now, Congress

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

intended as BPA told them it would that it would use

2

nonfirm power in the lead subject to interruption or

3

protection, of firm resources only in load in order to

4

serve the purposes Congress intended by guaranteeing

5

this mandated contract.

6

Those purposes were, one, to provide rate

7

relief

8

served by the private utilites, rate relief which the

9

DSI's

would have to pay for, and that is why that power

10

getting to the DSI’s was important, and also provide

11

through the raising of rates from wholesale to retail

12

essentially more profit downstream for Bonneville.

13

this was all integrated into the comprehensive

14

legislative scheme.

15

Now

Congress intended specifically that a higher

16

level of actual service be received by the DSI’s through

17

the combination of

18

demand capacity; and (2) a limitation in 5(d)(1)(A) on

19

the circumstances under which that power could be

20

interr upted.

(1) a direction to Ponneville of a

You can find nowhere in the legislative

22

history, if I may return the compliment, any discussion,

23

any discussion whatsoever that by reaffirmation of

24

preference somehow nonfirm power has been kept outside

25

of the DSI load where Bonneville wanted to put it in

customers are going to be served by mandate of Congress

contracts, of the old preference problems and a

reaffirmation of preference for the future, preference

9

in its traditional meaning, preference which honors

lawful contracts, but preference which governs

11

everything including my client's rights to any future

contracts.

precisely what Bonneville did in the contracts under
