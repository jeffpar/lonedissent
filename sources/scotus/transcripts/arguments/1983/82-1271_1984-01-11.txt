PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Mr. Frey, I think you

may proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER
SR. FREYi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
This case is a suit ty four individuals — two
citizens of the United States and two aliens lawfully

10

present in the United States — for declaratory and

11

injunctive relief challenging the lawfulness of the

12

manner in which the Immigration and Naturalization

13

Service conducted factory surveys at two garment

14

factories in southern California in which

15

Respondents were employed.

16

the

The importance of these factory surveys to the

17

INS’ responsibility to attempt to apprehend and deport

18

aliens illegally present in the United States is

19

difficult to overstate.

20

Angeles in 1977 20,000 illegal aliens were apprehended

21

in the course of such surveys,

22

Service has told us that away from the border at the

23

time prior to the decision in this case approximately 60

24

percent of all apprehensions of illegal aliens occurred

25

in the course of factory surveys.

The record shews that in Ics

and the Immigration

Now some years ago the factory surveys became

2

during

3

several reasons.

4

Previously a lot of the enforcement efforts had been

5

concentrated in residential investigations of areas

6

where there were believed to be high concentrations of

7

illegal aliens living, and it was thought that it would

8

be far less intrusive, it would raise fewer Fourth

9

Amendment problems, it would be less intrusive in

the 1970s a more important tool to the INS for
One was a matter of «values.

10

privacy values for the agency to concentrate on the

11

workplace rather than in residential areas.

12

Secondly, it was. believed

and I think quite

13

plainly accurately — that this was a more effective

14

utilization of the resources of the Service, because a

15

relatively small number of agents were able to make

16

relatively substantial numbers of apprehensions.

17

And, thirdly, it was deemed appropriate

18

because the prospect of employment is the principal,

19

magnet that draws people to attempt to enter the country

20

illegally and work force surveys and enforcement efforts

21

concentrated on the work force seem correlative to the

22

factors that have drawn the people here.

QUESTIONS

Nr. Frey, may I ask you a

preliminary question?
NR. FREY:

Certainly.

1

QUESTION:

And that relates to whether the

2

Plaint iffs here in the case below had standing under the

3

Lyo ns decision cf this Court last time.
NR. FREY:

4
5

Yes, I believe that they do.

don *t challenge their standing.

6

QUESTION:

I know you don’t, but why not?

7

NR. FREY:

Well,

8

We

the reason I think they dc is

that t hese work place surveys are recurrent and at
garmen t factories where these individuals were employed

10

it is likely that there will be, and in fact at Davis

11

Pie ati ng Company there were two surveys during the year

12

in que stion.
QUESTION:

13
14

in the future, assuming the practice?
NR. FREY:

15
16

And is that likely to be repeated

It is likely to be repeated if the

Ninth Circuit’s decision is reversed.
The consequences of the Ninth Circuit’s

17
18

decisi cn, while factory surveys are still being dene,

1

they a re very difficult to do at large facilities like.

20

Davis Pleating because the restrictions would make it

21

too ch aotic, and I’ll get to that shortly.
Now I’d like to briefly describe these

22

23

survey s.

First, the first point that I think is

24

signif icant is that they are not done randomly but they

25

are ba sed on investigations which lead to the

1

acquisition of information that a substantial number of

2

illegal aliens are employed at the particular target

3

factor y .

4

^

find indeed the results of the surveys that we

5

have before us in this case indicate this.

Davis survey —
QUESTIONi

7

The first

Is there something in the record

8

about that -- about the fact that these aren’t just

9

random?

10

Is there some testimony or anything?
HR. FREYs

Well, I think there is, yes.

11

think there is an affidavit from one of the INS

12

directors, I believe, that suggest that.

13

I

logic would dictate that it would make nc

14

sense for them to go about randomly.

15

limited resources in terms of personnel to do these

16

things , and they obviously want to utilize them in the

17

most effective way where they can arrest the largest

18

number of people with the smallest number of agents.

19
20
21

QUESTION;

They have very

Mr. Frey, is an administrative

warrant possible?
MR. FREY;

There were warrants in two of the

22

three searches in this case.

They proceed either by

23

warrant or by consent.

24

percent cf the cases the factory owner cr management

25

gives consent to the survey, and where consent is net

I'm told that in about 90

given a warrant is used.
In these cases, 78 illegal aliens were

3

arrested in the first Eavis survey; 39 in the second;

4

and in the Mr. Pleat survey 45, which was 50 percent of

5

the work force.

6

be illegal aliens and apprehended.

7

course, have been some more.

There were 90 workers; 45 were found to

QUESTIONS

What would be the situation if the

employees were working on a paving project or building a
bridge cut in the open — no enclosure at all?
MR. FREY;

Well, the Court of Appeals decision

relied fcr its holding, in part, on the fact that the

3

factories are enclosed and

4

were stationed at the exits.

5

There may, of

that the exits -- that agents

If you had an outdoor job site you would have

6

a different factual situation.

7

Court cf Appeals wculd reach the same conclusions.

8

We're not dealing here with any issue of a search.

9
20

21

QUESTION;

I'm not sure that the

Could a warrant be obtained to

check out in open spaces?
MR. FREY;

No.

No, no.

The warrant is

22

obtained to deal with the interests of the owner of the

23

factory and not having his premises searched.

24

involves no search issue; it involves only issues cf

25

seizures -- whether there were seizures and, if so.

This case

1

whether they were lawful.

2

3

QUESTIONi

Mr. Frey, may I ask?

This may be a

far-out hypothetical.

4

Let's suppose you have a study of a given

5

neighborhood and the study was that the probabilities

6

are that -- it's a black neighborhood — that 20 to 25

7

percent of the residents of that neighborhood have

8

committed crimes.

That's all.

9

And then the police launch a program to stop

10

and interrogate on a random basis all of the blacks in

11

the neighborhood.

12

think ?

13

MR. FREYs

Would that be all right, do you

I think that would pose seme

14

interesting and difficult questions whether — if you

15

had this abstract 20 or 25 percent probability that the

16

individual you stopped had committed a crime but no

17

specifica information.

18

Martinez-Fuerte was a case somewhat like that,

19

and I think that that is not at all involved in this

20

case because there are no individual seizures of

21

particular workers based on — not based on information

22

specifically relating to those workers.

23
24
25

QUESTIOFi

No, but the interrogations were

random, were they not?
MR. FREYi

Well,

as I -- the interrogations

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

are not random but the interrogations —

2
3

MR. FREY;

But they are not.

They don't

involve seizures of the individuals.
QUESTION i

6
7

Well, they are in the sentence, are

they not?

4
5

QUESTION:

I know.

We're talking only afccut

the interrogation that was made.
MR. FREYs

8

Well, but the Fourth Amendment

doesn't apply on interrogations.

It applies to

10

seizures.

If you must seize and forceatly detain a

11

person in order to question them, then the Fourth

12

Amendment is brought into play because you have seized

13

them and they have a protection against being

14

unreasonably seized.
QUESTION;

15

Well, Mr. Frey, is there not a

18

seizure or detention when the agents question the

17

employee?

18

there's no overall seizure of the premises, is there an

1

individual seizure if a person is detained for

20

questioning ?

Even if we were to agree with you that

MR. FREY;

21

I think that is absolutely clear.

22

It think it is absolutely clear after Florida against

23

Royer that what — if you look at the record of this

24

case,

25

he's a citizen.

what happens is a person is approached, asked if
There is no physical contact except

that Miramontes, I think, or Lebonte was tapped on the

2

should er.

3
4
5

QUESTION;

If he says it*s none of your

business, you don't seize him?
MR. FREY;

We don't.

We don't do anything

6

unless in the course of saying it or something else that

7

he or she has done we acquire a particularlized

8

suspicion of illegal alienage.

9
10
11

QUESTION;

What happens if the person refuses

to answer the question?
BE. FREY;

You move on to another person.

12

That in fact doesn't happen in these situations very

13

frequently, but that is what the agents are instructed

14

to do unless they have a particularized suspicion cf

16

illegal alienage.

16

questioning.

17

They are not to engage in^detentive

And if you look at the record in this case and

18

read the Joint Appendix, which I urge you to dc, and

19

read the testimony of the Respondents in this case, it

20

seems to me you would only — I mean, I come away with

21

the conclusion that they were trying to give the agents

22

an award for their scrupulous sensitivity to Fourth

23

Amendment rights and net to —

24
25

QUESTION;

Mr. Frey, what if there is a

particularized suspicion abcut a particular person and

10

-

1

the agent goes up to him and says "Are you a citizen?"

2

and he says, "Sorry, I won’t answer; it’s none of ycur

3

business."

What does he do then?

4

EE. FREY:

Well, that would be the —

5

QUESTION;

He hasn’t got probable cause.

6

EE. FREY;

Well,

there is nothing — that is

7

the problem that’s inherent in any Terry stop situation,

8

if the individual refuses --

9

QUESTION;

Well,

then he can walk away.

10

EE. FREY;

If probable cause does not develop

11

during the course of the detention, then the detention

12

must be terminated.

13

QUESTION;

Exactly.

14

QUESTION;

Well, I take it that what this adds

15

up to is a statement on your part that the Fourth

16

Amendment does not prevent officials, police or ethers,

17

from asking questions.

18

MR. FREY*

Well, that’s what the Court said in

19

Florida against Royer — even questions of people who

20

they suspect, as long as it is not accompanied by

21

conduct that would lead the person reasonably to believe

22

that they were not free to leave.

23

QUESTION;

But if you have particularized

24

suspicion but not probable cause, you may momentarily

25

detain them to ask a question; is that right or net?

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

MR. FREY;

Yes, you may detain them and you

2

may ask a question and if in the course of that brief

3

detention probable cause develops, you may then arrest

4

him .

5

QUESTION;

But if he says "get your hand off

6

my arm; I'm just not interested in answering any of your

7

questions, I'm going to walk away", you’ve got to let

8

him walk away?

9

MR. FREY;

You are out of luck except in

10

circumstances where there may be some ether brief

11

investigative measure that you can take while you're

12

holding him that might clarify the situation and develop

13

probable cause.

14

QUESTION;

But it's your position that the

15

reasonable suspicion that’s required here is net

16

reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the country,

17

but merely reasonable suspicion of Hispanic origin?

18

MR. FREY;

Well, let me define somewhat the

19

issues in this case because I think it's very important

20

and I think the Ninth Circuit's opinion and the

21

Respondents' brief is quite confusing on this.

22

But there are two separate issues.

One is the

23

question of whether the entire work force is seized by

24

the techniques that are employed in the factory survey

25

and, if so, whether that seizure violates the Fourth

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Amendm ent

2

Then there would he -- the next question would

3

be whether in the course of conducting the survey and

4

having contact with individual workers at the work place

5

what transpires is a seizure and, if sc, is that seizure

6

lawful on an individual basis rather than a group basis.

7

QUESTIONs

Well, tut you've already answered

8

me that you say the questioning does not involve a

9

seizur e .

10

ME. FREY*

That's correct.

11

QUESTIONs

But you said in response to Justice

2

White it might involve a momentary detention of the

3

Terry-type to ask questions.

4

MR. FREY*

No, no, no, no.

If I said that, I

5

did not intend that.

6

if there were such a detention what consequences would

7

flow if there were no questions asked, or no answers

8

given .

9

I understood him to he postulating

Let me back up for a minute.

If the Court of

20

Appeals is correct that there is an illegal seizure cf

2

the entire work force,

22

of whether people can be questioned on the basis cf a

23

suspicion of alienage alone, because there already is a

24

Fourth Amendment violation.

25

unlawfully seized.

then this case presents no issue

They have all been

The relief that's been entered wculd

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

be entered

2

If the Court of Appeals, as we submit, is

3

wrong in that, the record in this case presents not a

4

single instance in which any person was detained for

5

questioning on the basis solely of a suspicion of

6

alienage alone, and not of illegal alienage.

7

QUESTION*

Well, it does present, does it not,

8

situations where individuals were questioned?

9

these named plaintiffs were questioned; is that true?

10

HR. FREY:

In fact,

Yes, but as I said earlier, the

11

Fourth

12

regulates seizures.

13

QUESTION:

Ycu said there were no seizures in

15

MR. FREY:

seizures?

18
19

stoutly as I am able to that there were no individual

20

seizures in this case, and if you look at the

21

interchanges Ccrrea was not asked any questions during

22

the first survey and during the second survey; she was

23

asked if she was a citizen, said she was, and the agent

24

moved on.

25

QUESTION :

What are they — what do the agents

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

QUESTIONS

12
13

Hr. Frey, can I ask you a question

on thi s point?

14

MR. FREYs

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

One of my problems is that I think

16

that w hat one might normally expect in the way of

17

findin gs of fact are really quite sparse in this case,

18

Are th e findings -- do the findings actually spell out

Everybody suggests that there is no dispute
I would say there is no —

That's really what troubles me.

25

MR. FREYs

I would say there is no dispute

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

about the material facts.

2

look at the testimony you will see nothing that raises

3

any factual issues.

4

QUESTION*

That is, I would say if you

But should we have to look at the

5

testimony in a case of this kind that comes in this way,

6

because I read the briefs and I get an entirely

7

different impression of the facts from both sides.

8

look for findings, and I am kind of at a less.
ME. FREY;

10
11

I

Well, you can get a different

impression from the adjectives.
QUESTION;

And in a summary judgment case that

12

normally isn't true.

13

say these are the facts and you can decide the case on

14

this basis.

15

Normally the people are willing to

I don't know exactly what happens, for

18

example, if a worker during work hours gets up and walks

17

to the gate where an agent is posted.

just walk right out.

You say they can

1

MR. FREY;

Well, they did in this case.

20

QUESTION;

Pardon me?

21

MR. FREY;

The Respondents did.

22

in this case walked right out.

And we have to read the testimony

to so conclude, don't we?
MR. FREY;

Well, I don't really —

1

QUESTION:

What I'm really asking — I won't

2

take your time up — but is it not possibly a case which

3

requires some findings of fact to know exactly what

4

should

5

be dene with it?
ME. FREY:

Well, I think it’s a case in which

6

it would have been perhaps helpful to have some findings

7

of fact, but if the Court of Appeals is right in its

8

legal conclusions it makes no difference whether anybody

9

was stopped or would have been stopped, because the

10

Court of Appeals says that the fact that agents were

11

visible in the doorways was itself enough

12

a seizure and violate the Fourth Amendment, and on that

13

basis an injunction has been issued against —

14

QUESTION:

c

to constitute

I understand your position there.

Are you saying, though, that -- assume we disagreed with

16

the Court of Appeals and say they went too far.

17

correct disposition to reenter the summary judgment cf

18

the District Court or send it tack and say we've get to

19

know more about it?

20

NR. FREY:

21
22

Well,

there were cross motions for

summary judgment.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but is

23

that your position — that we should reenter the

24

District Court's summary judgment?

25

Is the

MR. FREY:

That would be our position, I

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

think, but we are into some areas of civil procedure

2

that I don't feel terribly comfortable with.

3

QUESTION»

Aren't you just objecting to the

4

holding of the Court of Appeals as a matter of law, that

5

the whole factory is seized?

6

ME. FREY:

Yes.

Me disagree with the Court of

7

Appeals on a number cf points, tut if the Court were to

8

conclude, as we think it must if it applies its prior

9

Fourth

10

Amendment principles, that there was no seizure

of the entire work force —

11

QUESTION i

Do we have to reach anything else?

Then there is an incident described in the

is significant and, of course, our position with respect

about the surveys.

18

19

alien workers who were arrested had not committed any

crime, in her view, and it disturbed her that they v,ere

21

being arrested and deported.

22

And what bothered her about the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It also disturbed her that citizens are not

In one of the

But, Nr. Fenton, may I interrupt?

2

There are really three kinds of individuals.

3

4

lawful residents.

5

that a person other than an unlawful alien attempted to

6

leave the factory and was restrained from doing so?

Is there any evidence in the record

MR. FENTON:

7

Some are

The only evidence was this one

instance that Mr. Frey referred to where someone was

9

handcuffed and then the handcuffs were taken off.
QUESTION:

10

11

Do we know whether that person was

a citizen or not?
MR. FENTON:

12

13

indicated that he or she was a citizen, was disbelieved,

14

evidently, was handcuffed, and subsequently the

at it from their vantage point — the vantage point of

the average worker.

9

QUESTION:

But part cf the point that Justice

10

Blackmun makes, I think, is maybe they don't really have

11

any motive to leave, except the unlawful people.

12

MR. FENTON:

Well, I think that — I think

13

that when they see people being handcuffed at the outset

14

and they see law enforcement officers there, I think

15

they may very well have a motive to leave, and I think

16

the reason that they are forced to remain is simply

17

because they see that if they do leave they themselves

18

might be suspected of being illegal aliens, or they

19

themselves might be handcuffed.
They themselves may place themselves in a

20
21

position where they could possibly be deported.

that he never tried to leave, nor did he leave the

compelled to remain not only because of the people who

were stationed there, but because there was a large

MR. FENTON;

QUESTION i

Mr. Fenton, what does the record

show — and perhaps some else has covered this, tut I

8

think there seems to be some confusion — about people

9

who sought to leave and were prevented from leaving in

10

the absence of any showing of reasonable suspicion?

11

MR. FENTONs

Okay.

Well, the only thing the

12

record shows is, as I said before -- and I can refer to

13

it — is, for example, Delgado saw five people being

stopped at the back door.

seek to question them on the way out, even though they

QUESTION;

2

MB. FENTON;

Well, it's the closest case.
Yes, it is.

If I Bay discuss it,

3

the situation there involved a permanent checkpoint

4

which had been in place for some 24 years.

5

held that there was a very minimal subjective intrusion

6

because all motorists using that highway knew it's

7

there.

8

practically every week, and all you do is slow down, and

9

you know that that is all that's going to happen.

The Court

I personally use that road all the time,

The Court contrasted that very minimal

10
11

subjective intrusion to the very substantial intrusion

12

involved in roving stops by border patrols.

stop.

It’s a surprise entry by these officers; it's

know this is going tc happen and it’s going to recur;

that it's going to recur at any particular point in

They don't know necessarily that it's going to

I think that cur standing lies in the fact

7

that the government has admitted that they're going to

8

continue engaging in these surveys.
QOESTIORj

Would Martinez-Fuerte be different

10

if the government didn't maintain its checkpoint at the

11

same place every day of the year?

12

MR. FENTONt

I think the decision would have

13

been different.

14

and this Court said that you had a very minimal

15

subjective intrusion.

16

anxiety was engendered by the checkpoint, since it was

17

permanently there and everyone knew that it was there.

18

I think it was crucial to the decision,

Very little fear, very little

This Court also held that one has a much lower

1

expectation of privacy in an automobile and everyone

20

expects to be stopped once in a while for vehicle — for

21

traffic tickets and so forth by law enforcement agents.

22

And another factor, another crucial

23

distinguishing factor, I think, in Martinez-Fuerte is

24

that really it was an extension of the border.

25

at the junction of two highways leading away from the

situation.

the highway between San Diego and Los Angeles?
ME. FENTON:

That’s correct.
So that it’s hard to say it was the

border because people headed north from San t)iegc had to

12

pass through that stop.

13
14
15

ME. FENTGNi

Well, it's net technically the

border, but I think it’s an adjunct to the border.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t think the Court would

16

have needed the reasoning it used in Martinez-Fuerte to

17

justify the step if it had teen a traditional border

18

stop where you can stop anybody, regardless of any sort

19

of probable cause.

MR. FENTON:

I recognize that. Your Honor.

I’m just saying that that was a factor.

I think the crucial point was

that it was a very minimal subjective intrusion.

we have a very substantial subjective intrusion.

the law suit was -- the Ninth Circuit took the position

MR. FENTON;

Well, Your Honor, we would submit

20

that they really are in the case even though the Ninth

21

Circuit didn’t deal with the standing question.

22

But I think the crucial point is that these

23

surveys are continuing and we submit that hundreds of

24

thousands of people each year are — have their rights

25

violated by virtue of these surveys, so that it’s

14

MR. FENTON*

Yes, Your Honor, that’s correct.

Cur point is that —

Now again in considering the reasonableness of

16

the seizure, it's appropriate to examine whether or not

17

there are alternative means of enforcement available to

18

the INS to solve the problems that they assert exist,

19

and we'submit that there certainly are.

20

First of all, INS workplace surveys have never

been seriously proposed as any portion of the solution

22

to cur immigration problems.

24

our problems and surveys were not among them.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ANDREW I. FREY

4

CN BEHALF OF PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

5
6

MR. FREY*

A couple of points, Mr. Chief

Justic e.

7

First of all, I think my colleague

8

underestimates the intelligence of his clients when he
suggests that they are so frightened for their own

10

welfare.

In fact. Respondent Correa, in explaining what

11

bothered her, at page 116 of the Joint Appendix, was

12

talking about she was upset that production was

13

interrupted and they had to compete with non-union

14

shops.
And then she says, "Immigration goes by in the

15
16

car."

She says, "These people are legal.

17

have anything to fear.

13

they're going to come through."

It's just the idea, I guess,

"Well, do you fear when you see an Immigration

1
20

officer?"

21

It's what I see."

22

They don't

"Not when I see them.,

I don't fear for me.

I think these individuals are quite clear

23

about what is going on and what kind of threat the

24

survey represents tc them.

1

these places, they are likely targets.

2

Let nie just — Justice Brennan raised the

3

question of Davis against Mississippi and I do think

4

that that is a very different case, because you have to

5

distinguish between this hypothetical group seizure

6

that’s gone on here and the question of the seizure and

7

arrest in Davis against Mississippi cf an individual.

8
9

-

And I agree that you would need probable
cause, under Dunaway against New York, a well settled

10

law, -- to arrest an individual you would need

11

reasonable suspicion, as in Cortez, to make a seizure of

12

a particular individual suspected of an offense,

13

suspected of being subject to a seizure.

14

theoretical seizure of the entire work force is a

15

totally different animal.

But this

And the point that Justice Stevens was getting

16
17

at with

my colleague, suppose that they had identified

18

39 people on the second day of a survey by name who were

19

present and they had gotten a warrant naming those 39

20

people.

21

same procedures to prevent those people from running out

22

and hiding and to try to identify who they were.

They would still have employed precisely the

And under the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit,

24

even if they had a warrant based on probable cause they

25

would still be violating the Fourth Amendment rights of
