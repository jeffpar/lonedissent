ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. EASTERBROOK*

10

TMr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The questions in this case concern the

11
12

application of the Sherman Act to the NCAA's

13

arrangements for the telecasting of college football.

14

Two agreements are at issue.

15

by the

16

contracts signed between the NCAA and

17

Turner television networks.

One is the TV plan adopted

NCAA's members and the other is a series of
the ABC, CBS and

These agreements collectively govern the TV

18
19

appearances of college football teams.

They give ABC

20

and CBS the right to broadcast football in

each fall, or roughly one slot

Saturday.

23

total of 35 different games each fall,

24

each network to broadcast the games of at least 82

25

different teams, different colleges, over a period of

14 time slots

Colleges may telecast games outside the

2
3

network contracts only in compliance with a series of

4

rules called the exceptions rules.

5

exceptions rules have permitted the telecast of more

stadiu ms.
The decisions of the lower courts rest on tvo

11
12

principal bases.

First they held these agreements are

13

unlawful per se because they are horizontal arrangements

14

among competitors, the colleges, to reduce the output,

15

that is the number of different games shown on TV.
Second, the courts held

16

they're unlawful under

17

the rule of reason.

The Tenth Circuit thought that the

18

plan violated the rule of reason because only large

19

networks would be able to bid for these contracts and

20

that created objectionable foreclosure of broadcasting

21

by competing TV stations.
As the case comes here there are seven issues

22
23

before the Court.

24

questions:

Our petition presents four

questions concerning the scope of the per se

existence of market power, and the application of the

2

rule of reason if the Court funds market power.
Respondents have invoked two different grounds

3
4

in support of their judgment.

They have argued that the

5

arrangements are unlawful per se as boycotts and as

6

monopolization.
And the Solicitor General has added still a

7

8

seventh issue to this case.

The Solicitor General

9

argues that the Court should replace the traditional

10

dichotomy between per se analysis and rule of reason

11

analysis with a new three-tier analysis.
Seven issues is obviously too many to handle

the centerpiece of this case.

19

rule of reason rather than the per se rule applies

20

because the agreements are useful in helping the NCAA

21

and its members compete against other forms of

22

entertainment.

23

We have argued that the

What you think of that argument will depend on

24

what you think of our market power argument.

If you

25

agree with us about the nature of competition in this

market, it follows not only that the NCAA has no market

power, but that the arrangements are pro-competitive

tools that help to compete against other forms of

entertainment.

QUESTION;

Mr. Easterbrook, is the NCAA a

for-profit association or a non-profit?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It is a non-profit

association, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

And are the universities that are

members of it non-profit?

11

MR. EASTERBROOK;

12

If the Court doesn't agree with our

13

contentions on market power, though, we have I think an

14

uphill fight on the per se issues, because most of our

15

arguments about how these arrangements help the NCAA's

16

members to compete depend on our characterization of

17

what the market is.

18

They are.

Market power is also the principal thing

19

separating us from, the Solicitor General in this case.

20

The Solicitor General joins us in arguing

21

se rule is inapplicable here because the NCAA's

22

arrangements are potentially pro-competitive.

23

Solicitor General then calls for a novel intermediate

24

tier of scrutiny under which the Court takes a quick

willing to agree with the Solicitor General's approach,

2

but only if the quick look starts with a look at market

power.

4

Market power is essential in our view because

5

otherwise the courts end up condemning whatever they do

not fully understand.

7

power.

It's this:

Market power under this Court’s

14

cases is the ability to raise price by reducing output.

15

That is, we want to know if the defendant has the

16

ability to charge a monopoly price.

17

there's no antitrust reason to be concerned about its

practices.

MR. EASTERBROOKi

11

They are flat commitments,

12

Your lonor.

But the amount of money the network will be

13

willing to pay as a flat commitment or a contingent

members supply programs to television stations and

fewer people watch, the network gets less money and it

that market definition, like any other definitional

10

around a set of activities that gives people who engage

11

in those activities the power to drive up price by

reducing how much they sell?

And that's where we say the lower courts have

14

failed, because they haven’t even attempted to do that.
QUESTION;

15

Mr. Easterbrook,

may I ask you a

16

question.

17

earlier that viewers or advertising dollars are

18

essentially fungible,

19

district court at page 75A of the opinion said something

20

quite different, that they pay a much higher rate for

21

Saturday football than they do for baseball or soap

22

operas .

23

Does your argument depend -- I think

viewing time.

MR. EASTERBROOK;

you said

I thought the

That’s correct,

they pay a

24

much higher rate per thousand viewers per 30-minute spot

25

than they do for pro baseball.

The question is what one

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

makes of that.

2

collect in a footnote in our brief shows that they pay a

3

much lower rate than for pro football, they pay about 51

4

percent less than for horse racing, and 131 percent less

5

than for Dynasty.
Now,

6

As it turns out, the lata which we

Horowitz,

11

testified at pages 602 to 604 of the appendix that the

12

reason

13

that the people who watch have a higher amount of

14

education than the people who watch baseball.

15

Advertisers are always willing to pay more for more

16

educated, higher income viewers, on the theory that they

17

go out and buy more.

why the NCAA gets a higher price per viewer is

What you then have to answer in order to

19

figure out whether the NCAA has market power, given the

20

difference in these viewers, is whether there is

something special about the NCAA's audience.

QUESTION;

That is,

I think maybe more precisely, Mr.

17

Easterbrook, what I'm asking is, if the district court

18

took the view that I just indicated, do you have to

19

convince us that it was clearly erroneous in doing so?

20

The Solicitor General argues rather heavily that maybe

21

you're right in theory, but you've got to contend

23

two ways.

the result is reached,

20

full-blown rule of reason analysis, or a more carefully

species of a rule of reason violation is what
