Thank you.

hr.

Mr. Chief -Justice,

and may it please the Courts
This case and the companion case of Strickland

10

versus

Washington concern the circumstances under which

11

an otherwise valid judgment of conviction may he set

12

aside on the basis of asser ted.defects in district court

13

by defense counsel.
This issue is one of substantial importance to

14
15

the administration of justice in the federal and state

16

courts .

17

such claims are raised and because of the often extended

18

proceedings that some courts have ordered to dispose of .

19

those claims.

20

This is so because of the frequency with which

All too often, in our view,

the courts engaged

21

in a somewhat detached inquiry into the litigating

22

judgments and performance of counsel in the abstract,

23

rather than focusing on what we submit should be the

24

central concern, that is, whether any errors by counsel

25

in turn prejudiced the accused by causing a fundamental

1

defect in the proceedings.

2

In order to obtain relief on a claim of

3

ineffective assistance of counsel, it is our position

4

that the accused must show errors that fall below the

5

minimum level of competence of counsel; and second, that

6

any such errcrs in turn had a probable effect cn the

7

outcome of the case or otherwise undermine the

8

fundamental fairness of the proceedings.

9

In this case, the Court of Appeals did net

10

make any such findings in reversing the Respondent's

11

conviction cn the ground of ineffective assistance of

12

counsel.

In fact, it did net —
QUESTION;

13

Nr. Kneedler, I'm troubled in this

14

case by the fact that there are two different types of

15

ineffective assistance of counsel claims;

16

state itself impairs the effective assistance of

17

counsel, either by not appointing counsel at all or by

18

taking seme action that would impair the right; a second

19

time is, assuming there's no interference by the court

20

or the

22

adopt.

one where the

state as such w.ith counsel, counsel simply fails

23

Now, which type of claim was litigated here?

24

KB. KNEEEIEE;

25

Well, the principal basis of

the claim and the one that the Court of Appeals decided

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-4300

1

was of the first type that you mentioned.

2

Appeals held that, in effect, that it must be

3

conclusively presumed that Respondent's attorney Cclston

4

did not have — it was impossible for him to prepare for

5

trial within the 25 days allowed.

QUESTION;

The Court of

So that it was an impairment by the

state itself, in effect, of —

8

HR. KNEEDIER;

9

QUESTION*

That's correct.

-- the right to counsel.

Now, is

10

that the presentation that was made by the Defendant in

11

this case, the Respondent?

12

some other kind?
MR. KNEEDIER;

13

Or did the Respondent argue,

That was the principal claim.

14

There were passing allegations of inadequacies in the

15

actual

16

general assertions that counsel never objected to any

17

evidence, without identifying particular objections.

18
19
20

performance of counsel as well.

QUESTION;

There were seme

In your view, did the Court of

Appeals resolve only the first type of claim?
HR. KNEEDLER;

The Court of Appeals plainly

21

resolved only the first, because the Court noted the

22

Government's objection that in fact Respondent had net

23

identified any specific failings by counsel.

24

QUESTION;

Is the other issue here?

25

MR. KNEEDIER;

I believe it's not here in its

5
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

entirety, largely because most of the specific failings

2

of trial counsel that Respondent points to were never

3

identified in the Court of Appeals, even though there

4

was a claim that counsel in fact had performed

5

inadequately.

QUESTIONS

The specificity with which Respondent now

Well, if we dealt only with the

part type, do we have to remand as to the second type?
MB. KNEEDIEFs

9

No, as to the second type it's

10

our position that the appropriate procedure would be for

11

Respondent tc raise any claims about specific defects in

12

counsel's performance in a motion under 2255, because

this was —

MR. KNEECIER;

Yes.

That was, I think, the

premise of the question.

18

QUESTIONS

That was the assumption, yes.

19

MR. KNEEDLER i

That allegations of specific

20

defects be raised under 2255, largely because they are

21

often thought, and usually do, arise from things outside

22

the record, so it would often be necessary to make a

23

record, and in any event to have the trial court in the

24

first instance tc make an assessment of the impact of

25

any errors by counsel.

QUESTIONS

1

I don't see how he could do that,

2

Mr. Kneedler, unless we're to adopt a flat rule that

3

assistance of counsel “claims can't be raised on direct

4

appeal .
MS. KNEEDLERi

5

Well, if the claim can be

6

raised on direct appeal and resolved on the basis cf the

7

record created, then there'would be an appropriate

8

occasion to dispose of the case in that instance.

9

if it would require an extensive hearing, that's net the

But

10

sort of thing that would ordinarily be part of a direct

11

a p p ea 1.

12

QUESTIONS

But in this particular case,

13

supposing that the Respondent argued in the Court cf

14

Appeals specific failings and the Court of Appeals just

15

felt they didn't have to get to that because of the

16

shortness of time which counsel had and his lack of

17

experience.

18

wouldn't we send it back to the Court cf Appeals, if we

19

didn't decide the other issues ourselves, to let them

20

consider things that had been properly raised before

21

them in the first instance?

22

Then if we decided that was wrong, why

MR. KNEEDLERs

Well, if there were specific

23

errors that the Court of Appeals could dispose of by

24

assessing the record, then that would be appropriate.

25

Part of this ties into cur submission on the merits.,

1

though, as well, and that is that the essential pact of

2

a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not

3

counsel's performance in the abstract, but how it

4

affects the conduct of the trial and the rights of the

5

accuse d.

6

And so what the court would be doing on direct

7

appeal, what we submit it should be doing, is

8

determining whether the errors by counsel amounted to

9

plain error of the type that would warrant relief cn the

10

basis cf those errors themselves, without regard to

11

whether counsel had caused them or not.

So on direct appeal, if counsel is said to

have committed a plain — cr caused a plain error tc

HR. KNEEDLER ;

That's correct, and this comes

back to Justice O'Connor's position.

Respondent in

Powell.

on the ground that the Defendant did not have effective

assistance of counsel, arising cut of the circumstances

MR. KNEEDLER;

That’s right, initially.

They didn’t make an appointment.
And then when counsel finally

did assume responsibility,.it was too late and he had nc

oppcrt unity.

6

And the Court reiterated this point in Avery

7

versus Alabama, in which the Ccurt said that the

8

principle of Powell is whether the attorney had an

9

opportunity to consult and prepare.

And yet, in Avery

the Court rejected a Powell-type claim, even though

defense counsel had only three days to prepare a capital

case.

MR. KNEEDLER;

The Court did take into account

the need for conducting the trial promptly, but that is

Yes.

And that somehow fell below a

constitutional standard?
MB. KNEEDIERs

He did argue that, because his

20

lawyer did not have prior experience in criminal cases,

21

that that was a factor to be considered under what the

22

Tenth Circuit in this case devised to be a five-part

23

balancing test in which experience is one.

24

this Court, Respondent doesn't contend that he was

25

entitled absolutely to a lawyer with more experience,

But even in

13
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and we submit that that concession is well founded.

2

The Constitution speaks of the assistance of

3

counsel, and there’s no reason to believe that the

4

framers of the Sixth Amendment had anything in mind in

5

using the term "counsel" other than a person admitted to

6

the bar and admitted tc practice before the Court, as

7

Colston was.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

On the day when the case was called

for trial, did he ask for more time, defense counsel ask
for more time?
MB. KNEEDLER:

11

No, he did not, and when the

12

trial court made the inquiry as tc whether counsel was

13

prepared to proceed defense counsel pronounced

14

themselves ready.
I would also point out that Colston was net

alone in this case.

2

that mail fraud, which is what we had here, is an arcane

3

and complex area of the law.

accomplish the scheme.

Eut that generalization

Here there is no dispute about the use of the

9

mails in the scheme, and the scheme itself was a simple

10

one.

It involved check-kiting, which this Court

11

described in simple terms just two terms aco in Williams

12

versus United States.

13

advantage of the float created when checks are sent back

14

and forth from one bank to another.

15

that sort of scheme would not be difficult for any

16

attorney or anyone who maintains a checking account to

17

figure cut.

It involves the Defendant taking

The mechanics cf

There were a number of transactions in this

18
19

case,

but they were part of cne overall similar course

20

of conduct, and the defense counsel had available to him

21

the full records in the case and in fact a

22

reconciliation of the accounts of the banks by his

23

company’s own CPA that disclosed that the bank in

24

Oklahoma had lest a half a million dollars or that there

25

was a net overdraft of a half million dollars.

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Respondent does not dispute any of those facts

2

regarding the sending cf checks back and forth or the

3

net overdraft that resulted, and he concedes in his

4

brief that there was overwhelming evidence of his

5

control of the company involved and that he directed the

6

check-cashing activities.
COESTIGNs

7

Mr. Kneedler, what do you say about

8

his argument that the best defense was the absence of

9

criminal intent, and that the lawyer didn't raise that

10

def ens e?
MR. KNEEDLERi

11

Well, with all respect. Justice

12

Stevens, I believe that defense would be quite

13

far-fetched in these circumstances, largely because of

14

— or in part because cf the overwhelming nature cf the

15

Government's case.

16

there was testimony at trial that there was just

17

$150,000 a year annual sales.

18

testified tc that.

19

there were $5 million deposited in the two accounts over

20

a period of four months, the checks going back and forth

21

without any, even to this day, explanation of what sort

22

of legitimate banking practice would have been gcirg

23

on .

25

But the business involved here --

She was his secretary.

And yet,

I think in these circumstances for Respondent
to suggest that if there was a swindler it was the

contends that the bank ultimately recovered the proceeds

And in fact, although Respondent

and that there was no fraud, that’s also beside the
point.

5

First of all, it’s not necessary that a scheme

6

to defraud be successful under the mail fraud statute.

7

But in any event, the facts here just do not establish

8

that the bank was repaid, much less that it was repaid

9

voluntarily by Respondent in a way that could refute the

10

existence of criminal intent.

MR. KNEEDLER;

We don't know.

All I'm saying

19

is that it can't be said on the face of this record that

20

there was in our view anything approaching an argument

21

that this was a substantial avenue of defense in the

22

case.

There's certainly no basis in this record for concluding

that Colston made a Jencks Act error or any other.

And

He had the assistance of another

Another point that I would like to make in

21

this regard is that an attorney who does not have

22

extensive prior experience in a criminal case will often

23

compensate for that lack of experience by unusual or

24

atypical zeal in preparing the case and doing perhaps

25

more research and more preparation than another lawyer

2

might do.

Perhaps he would have more time to do sc.
But in any event, we submit that it would be

3

illogical under the Sixth Amendment to set aside a

4

conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of

6

counsel solely on the basis of counsel*s experience when

6

— cr if that attorney performed in exactly the same way

7

an experienced lawyer would do.

8

there could be no claim that the right to effective

9

assistance of counsel had been abridged.

10

In these circumstances

The last point I'd like to make on this, the

11

first prong of Respondent's argument in this case under

12

Powell, is that the Court cf Appeals' approach in this

13

case seems to us to be directly contrary to the Court's

14

decision last term in Morris versus Slappy, in which the

15

Court recognized that the scheduling of trials presents

16

a considerable problem for district courts and that the

17

court's scheduling of a trial will not be set aside

18

except in the face of an arbitrary action.

19

And in these circumstances, where the court in

20

fact granted the continuance rather than denying it, as

21

in Morris versus Slappy, we think it follows clearly

22

that there is no basis for setting aside the

23

conviction.

24

in this case, then, is simply to second-guess the

25

district court's ruling on a continuance under the guise

Basically what the Tenth Circuit has done

19

of adopting a five-part balancing test on the

2

ineffective assistance of counsel, and we think that

3

that's inconsistent with the approach in Morris.

4

I would also like to briefly address

5

Respondent’s second argument in this case, going tc

6

allegations of specific defects in attorney Colston’s

7

performance at trial.

8

these specific claims were not raised in the Court cf

9

Appeals, including the claim of a lack of criminal

11

necessary for this Court to review the record and go

12

raised

14

15

several of those claims in cur brief.

16

for the first time to determine whether there has
We have addressed

But we do think in this case that the nature

17

of the claims Respondent is making is instructive and in

18

fact vividly illustrates the problems that will be

19

created if this Court does net adopt a test as to

20

reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel

21

that requires a look to see whether there was a

22

fundamental defect in the proceedings that resulted from

23

the attorney's actions, rather than looking at the

24

attorney's actions in their own right.

25

What Respondent has done is tc comb the record

20

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 820-0300

-

1

to second-guess the counsel's performance as if the

2

purpose were to grade the lawyer, rather than to see

3

what happened to the client.

4

to stress that there are a number of difficulties with

5

this approach, a number of things that should give a

6

court pause before it engages in this sort of post hcc

7

review of counsel's litigating strategy.

8
9

And I think it's important

First, it requires an unseemly probing in many
cases of the lawyer's thought processes and

10

communications with his client.

In the long term, this

11

could have a very disheartening effect for defense

12

counsel, knowing that they would be routinly exposed in

13

their litigating judgments to scrutiny after the trial,

14

and this could, have the effect of deferring people from

15

accepting appointments in criminal cases.
Secondly, the nature of the inquiry is in some

16
17

respects as perversion of the adversary process.

A

18

hearing such as that required to determine why the

19

lawyer did what when has the effect of putting the

20

lawyer in the awkward position of defending himself,

21

while not wanting to undermine his client's claim for

22

relief.

23

the position of defending his former adversary's

24

actions, to say that they were reasonable and

25

effective.

And at the same time it puts the prosecutor in

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 820-9300

1

Third, it's often a highly subjective inquiry,

2

because it requires predictions about the state of the

3

law, what the attorney perceived in the case at the

4

time.

5

Fourth, it undermines the independence of

6

defense counsel, independence that this Court held just

7

two terms ago in Polk County is constitutionally

8

mandated; that once the lawyer is freed of the external

9

restraints that Justice O'Connor referred to, that is

10

effectively the assistance of counsel to which the Sixth

11

Amendment refers.

12

But under a rule that did not require a

13

substantial showing, the result could be to have ccurts

14

and prosecutors oversee defense counsel's actions at

15

trial in order to prevent the conviction from later

16

being set aside.

17

And also, under our adversary system, the

18

heart of it, the premise of it, is that the attorney,

19

either retained or appointed, who assumes responsibility

20

in a criminal case, is, as the Court said in Polk

21

County, performing an essentially private function, and

22

the integrity of the adversary process depends on the

23

presumption that the attorney will perceive his duties

24

and will conscientiously perform them according to his

25

ethical responsibilities.

Sc the Court should give

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

effect to that presumption.
And last, to have too quick, an inquiry into

3

counsel’s actual performance would detract from the

4

trial itself, because cur adversary system attaches

5

finality to a judgment of conviction and it presupposes

6

that a trial of the Defendant himself will not

7

automatically be followed by a trial of the attorney, as

8

Justice Brennan observed in his dissenting opinion in

9

Wainright versus Sykes.

10

Therefore, we believe a substantial showing

11

should be made before these sorts of inquiries are trade,

12

and in our view the appropriate objective criterion for

13

this is whether there is a substantial defect in the

14

proceedings that resulted from counsel’s action.

15

is an anchor, something rooted in the proceedings

16

themselves, rather than in counsel’s actions, to be

17

guided by the Court — to guide the Court.

18

This

It must be remembered that a party in
/

19

litigation cannot ordinarily get a valid judgment set

20

aside by saying his attorney made a mistake.

21

relief that a client has in those circumstances is

22

against his attorney for malpractice, not to set aside a

23

conviction and impose the burdens on his opponent.

24

we suggest — and in that malpractice action, the client

25

would have to show more than that the lawyer didn’t

2

some prejudice as a result and in fact, under

3

malpractice law, that the client would have prevailed.
We suggest that a similar showing of prejudice

is appropriate where what the lawyer seeks is to -- cr

what the Defendant seeks is to have his conviction set

12

If

But where the claim is that the lawyer

13

committed specific errors, it’s our submission that

14

these errors must be of comparable severity, comparable

15

seriousness or gravity to an outright denial of counsel

16

in order for relief to be granted.

17

purpose of the Sixth Amendment, as stated in Gideon and

18

other cases, is to guarantee the fairness of the

19

proceedings, the fundamental fairness of the

20

proceedings, we suggest that the inquiry therefore is

21

whether counsel's errors affected the fairness of the

22

proceedings.

23

And because the

This is reflected in this Court's decision in

the conviction resting on that sort of guilty plea would

be unfair.

of the inquiry is not to find fault or to award relief

10

attorney in the case, tut tc guarantee fairness to the

that counsel was ineffective, and the essence cf the

argument about ineffectiveness was that counsel was

these two, and it presumably read the record.

MR. KNEEDLERs

Yes, several points, Mr. Chief

Justice, thank you.

4

First with respect to the discussion during

5

Mr. Duke’s argument about what the client may have told

6

the attorney, I think that issue is highly relevant, as

7

is — and Respondent concedes this, too — the

8

information that counsel receives from the Government.

9

In this case the investigative file is relevant as to

10

counsels’ duty in the circumstances of the case, his

11

professional obligation to assess -- after all,

12

what counsel’s for, to assess the circumstances facing

13

the Defendant and try to make some judgment as to what's

14

worth pursuing and what isn’t.

that's

And again, I think it’s useful to draw on the

15
16

analogy in the Agurs decision, where the Court

17

determined the materiality of the evidence that should

18

have been turned over to the defense in terms of hew it

19

would have appeared to the prosecutor, its materiality,

20

the weight of whether it was a close case or not a close

21

cas e.

22

We think precisely the same rule applies with

23

respect to judging defense counsel’s performance,

24

including the weight of the Government’s case, and

26

that's the very reason why we believe it is appropriate

49

ALDSRSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC

1

in judging the element of prejudice in a case like this

2

to see whether in fact what the lawyer would have dene

3

would have had any effect on the outcome, given all the

4

circumstances of the case.
And in this case, I submit that, while Mr.

S
6

Duke has come up with a defense that might be

7

thecretieally plausible, to suggest that this sort of

8

defense in the circumstances of this case would have had

any effect on the jury's determination of Respondent's

10

guilt or innocence is, we submit, quite incredible.
