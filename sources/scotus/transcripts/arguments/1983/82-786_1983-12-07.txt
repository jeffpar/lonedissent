ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ALITO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case concerns the application of

10

the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled

11

self-incrimination when a subpoena is issued for the

12

standard business records of a sole proprietorship.

13

A federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey,

14

was investigating corruption in the awarding of county

15

and municipal contracts.

16

subpoenas for the records,

17

of sole proprietorships operated by respondent.

18

documents included records such as general ledgers, bank

19

statements, telephone toll records, vouchers, invoices,

20

in other words, wholly business records, and the sort of

21

records kept by virtually every business, no matter what

22

its size or form of organization.

23

The grand jury issued five
the standard business records
These

When respondent argued that the act of

24

producing these records would tend to incriminate him,

25

the government offered in exchange for receiving the

3

1

records not to use the act cf production against him in

2

any way in any subsequent criminal case.
QUESTION;

3

Nr. Alito, did the government ever

4

explain to the court that it would give the statutory

5

kind of use immunity?
HR. ALITCi

6

7

The government never made an offer

of statutory immunity for a number of —

8

QUESTION;

9

HR. ALITC;

Why not?
For at least two principal

10

reasons. Justice O'Connor.

11

lower courts in this case rejected the very concept of

12

act of production immunity.

13

that even if such immunity were given and the evidence

14

could

15

criminal trial, he would nevertheless inevitably be

16

incriminated in the eyes of the grand jury.

The district court held

not be used in any way against respondent in a

QUESTION;

17

First of all, both of the

Well, as I read the record, the

18

government was just never clear at all that it would

19

give statutory use immunity, and I wondered whether your

20

position is that that's the appropriate way to proceed,

21

if it is covered, if the act of production is covered at

22

all.

23

HR. ALITC;

Well, Justice O'Connor, our

24

position is that the ncn-statutory constructive act of

25

production immunity that was offered in this case is

4

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

sufficient, but we also believe that statutory immunity

2

would be available for the act of production and would

3

also be sufficient in this area, and if the Court were

4

to make clear in deciding this case that such statutory

5

immunity would obviate any Fifth Amendment objection,

6

then I think we would have no serious objection to such

7

a holding.

8

QUESTION*

Mr. Alito, is one of your

submissions that production wouldn’t Incriminate at all
10

in this case?

11

MR. ALITO:

We believe that here, as in

12

Fisher, the act of producing the documents would not

13

amount to testimonial self-incrimination.
QUESTION;

14
15

Is that one of your submissions

here?
MR. ALITC*

16

That is one of our submissions,

17

but. Justice White, we are not interested and never have

18

been interested in the act cf production, and therefore

1

we are quite happy to give respondent immunity from any

20

use —
QUESTION*

21
22

interested in the act of production?
MR. ALITC*

23
24
25

What do you mean, you weren’t

act of

We have no interest in using the

production in evidence or any evidence —
QUESTION*

But you are interested in the

materi ais
MR. ALITO;

We are interested in the

3

materials, and we are interested in the issue of act of

4

production only if it helps us get the materials.

5

6
7
8
9

QUESTION;

Well, both courts below thought the

act of production would incriminate in this case.
MR. ALITO;

Well, we respectfully disagree

with them, but I think —
QUESTION;

Well, we have to decide that issue

10

here, don’t we, whether it would incriminate or net?

11

can’t decide that you must offer statutory immunity

12

unless it is incriminating.

13
14

MR. A LITO;

I don’t believe it’s necessary to

reach that issue.

15

QUESTION;

Why?

16

QUESTION;

Doesn’t the statute require that

17

there be some threat of self-incrimination before the

18

government can grant immunity or some claim made?

19
20
21

MR. ALITO;

Well, there certainly was a claim,

and a colorable claim.
QUESTION;

I don’t believe --

Here is the United States saying

22

that the predicate for immunity is not present in this

23

case, namely, incrimination, unless you are going to

24

withdraw that.

25

We

MR. ALITO;

We don’t withdraw that submission,

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIR8T ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 6284300

1

and if the Court wishes to reach that before reaching

2

the issue of immunity —

3
4

QUESTIONS

Wishes.

I would suppose we would

have to.

5

KR. ALITCs

Well,

I don't believe that when

6

statutory immunity, for example, is offered, it is

7

necessary to fully adjudicate the legitimacy of the

8

Fifth Amendment claim before immunity can be conferred,

9

and I would suppose —
QUESTIONS

10

Do you think the United States is

11

free in the District Court to say, well, we are quite

12

sure that there is no incrimination in this case, but

13

even if there isn't, we will offer statutory immunity?
MR. ALITOs

14
15
16

claim,

When there is a Fifth Amendment

I believe that is essentially what happens.
QUESTIONS

Well, I guess the government could

17

say, we are not sure whether there is a Fifth Amendment

18

protection here, but if there is, we offer the immunity

19

under the statute.

20

ME. ALITCs

21

QUESTION*

That is my —
That is fine, but that isn't your

22

submission here.

23

incrimination. That is your submission.

24
25

You are sure there is no

KR. ALITCs

That is our submission.

I think

that because the lower courts found the colorable claim,

7
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the immunity issue could be reached first, but we have

2

absolutely no objection to the Court reaching the issue

3

of self-incrimination by means of the act of production

4

first, because we firmly believe that that is not

5

self-incriminating, for the same reasons, as in Fisher.

6

We think that the existence, possession, existence and

7

possession of standard business records is not

8

testimonial, and does not pcse a real and substantial

9

danger of self-incrimination in the case of sole

10

proprietorships just as that is true in the case of

11

corporations and partnerships.

12

QUESTION;

13

in some cases, would you not?

14

You would concede that it could be

MB. ALITO:

Certainly, in special

15

circumstances it could, but it is up tc the claimant of

16

the privilege to make it appear to the judge that those

17

circumstances are present.

18
19
20
21
22

QUESTION;

Well, he did.

He did.

Both courts

agreed with him.
MR. ALITO;

Well, he did, but we would submit

that that was incorrect.
QUESTION;

I am a little puzzled by one thing.

23

Three times now you have, perhaps without emphasis, but

24

at least I detected an emphasis, you have referred to

25

the act of production.

Now, are you distinguishing

8
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
4« FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-MOO

1

between the act of producing and then the content cf

2

what is produced?

3
4

SR. fiLITCi

Yes, we draw a very clear

distinction between that —

5

QUESTION*

Of course, the only thing he is

6

interested in protecting is the content of what is

7

produced. The act of producing doesn’t — couldn’t

8

possibly incriminate him.
MR. ALITO;

9

That is our submission, and I

10

think it is crystal clear in these cases that the

11

practical concern of the witnesses is solely the

12

contents of the documents.
QUESTION;

13

But you concede that in some ca ses

14

where,

15

had the records and was able to produce them might cast

16

suspicion on that person which hadn’t existed before,

17

that it is at least abstractly possible that the act of

18

production might incriminate.

19

for instance , merely identifying the person who

MR. ALITCi

It is abstractly possible, but I

20

think when you are talking about standard business

21

records, the kind cf records that every company has,

22

that it will seldom be the case that the act of

23

production will amount to testimonial

24

self-incrimination.

25

QUESTION;

Well, what of his uncertainty about

They do in their original form.

They are redacted in the petition.

12

QUESTION*

Suppose the government knows there

13

is a silent partner involved in some shady enterprise

14

but doesn't know who it is.

15

ten people, and they know that the silent partner is

16

reputed to have the records, so they simply issue

17

subpoenas for the records to each of the ten suspects.
MR. ALITO*

18

They know it may be one of

I think this is possible in

19

certain cases, but there is no question in this case

20

about who owns these companies.

21

first argued in District Court, respondent came in and

22

said,

23

proprietorships, and the government and the District

24

Court accepted that for purposes of argument.

25

is no issue here about who owns the companies and who is

QUESTION:

But if he produces them, if he

3

produces them and you want to use them at trial, would

4

you have to further authenticate them?

5

ME. ALITO*

6

QUESTION*

Yes, if -Why would you?

He produced them.

7

And isn’t the inference that they are his records, and

8

were prepared under his authority?

MR. ALITOs

Well, I believe they could easily

QUESTIONS

That is not my question.

Would you

have to offer further authentication?
ME. ALITOs

We would have to authenticate them

in some way at trial.
QUESTIONS

Well,

would it be enough to say he

to, if it has been produced under a subpoena.

You don’t

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

go through a long formality about authentication, do

2

you ?

3

HR. ALITO;

No, I don't believe you do.

I

4

think that is just our point.

Authentication is not a

5

substantial barrier under modern lav to the admission of

6

standard business records, and it is essentially a

7

fiction to argue that the unprivileged contents of these

8

records should be blocked, that the grand jury's access
to these unprivileged contents should be blocked based

10

upon this largely academic argument that the act of

11

production would amount to tacit authentication, and

12

would result in self-incrimination of the sole

13

proprietorship.

14

QUESTION;

Well, if it is largely academic,

15

why don't you just tender him immunity for any use of

16

the act of production?

17

HR. ALITO:

18

do. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

Well, that's what we attempted to

25

The district judge, as I read it, was trying to figure

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

out what the government was willing to do and never got

2

a clear, unambiguous statement.

3

ME. ALITO:

The district judge felt that our

4

immunity offer was insufficient because he believed that

5

incrimination in the eyes of the grand jury was

6

sufficient to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. We

7

disagree with that, and for that reason, he disagreed

8

with the entire concept.
QUESTION:

9

But you never offered immunity from

10

that particular exposure.

11

unnecessary.

12

is that this is all academic, it seems to me you can

13

solve the problem by giving him statutory immunity.

You may be right, but — If your position

MR. ALITO:

14

You thought it was

If the Court were to make it clear

15

that we could do that on remand, we would be entirely

16

satisfied.

clear that statutory immunity would obviate respondent's

2

QUESTION;

I just don't understand the

positi on at all, I confess.

3

QUESTION;

Do you think the District Court —

4

As I u nderstand your submission, even if you had

5

formal ly offered statutory immunity, the District Court

6

would not have required the records to be produced

7

becaus e the immunity wouldn't effectively replace the

8

privil ege.

9
10

Is that right?
MR. ALITO;

That was certainly the logic of

his po sition .

11

QUESTION:

It was the logic, except that he

12

didn't have to rule on that against the -- in the face

13

of an offer of statutory immunity.
MR. ALITO;

14
15

Well, we did not offer statutory

immuni ty.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. ALITO:

That's right.
We did not offer it in large

18

measur e because it was unclear that either of the courts

19

below would have construed an offer of statutory

20

immuni ty as limited to the act of production, because

21

both r ourts felt that there were serious problems with

22

the co ncept of act of production immunity.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Wouldn't it have been easier to

have o ffered it and had it refused?
MR. ALITO;

In retrospect, Justice Marshall,

14
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

it might have been. It might have been easier.

2

didn't —

3
4

QUESTIONi

We

Well, you want us to retrospect you

back and give you another bite.

5

On this question of the act, you say that

6

simply because these are ordinary business records, the

7

act of production doesn't involve anything?

8

9

KB. ALITO:

I think that's correct, Justice

Harsha 11.
QUESTION:

10

Well, do you know of any IRS cases

11

that were decided solely on regular business records?

12

mean,

how many millions, do you think?
MR. ALITO:

13
14

QUESTION:

MR. ALITO:

18

QUESTION:

MR. ALITC:

21

QUESTION:

23

That's true.
So the act of production does

incriminate you, doesn't it?

20

22

Many IRS cases are decided solely

on payrolls, for example.

17

19

I am not sure I understand the

question.

15
16

I

Well, perhaps I am not making —
I mean of producing ordinary

record s.
MR. ALITO:

The act of producing certain

24

documents in certain situations may well be

25

incriminating.

Our position is I think essentially what

15
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

you said in concurrence in Fisher.

2

existence of corporate records is not in doubt/ and

3

therefore conceding the existence and possession of

4

these records is net testimonial, and the same must be

5

true of partnership records in light of Beilis, and we

6

would argue the same would be true of the standard

7

business records of a sole proprietorship.

8

You said that the

There simply is not a rational basis for
drawing a distinction between these forms of business

10

units on this ground.

11

that corporations have general ledgers, for example, it

12

is equally a foregone conclusion, I would submit, that a

13

sole proprietorship has such document, and the logic of

14

that position means that in the case of a subpoena fer

15

standard business records, regardless of the form of

16

company involved, this — the act of production would

17

not amount to testimonial immunity — it would not

18

amount to testimonial self-incrimination.

1

QUESTION j

If it is a foregone conclusion

Well, it wouldn't be necessary to

20

prove that it had some general ledgers, but it would be

21

necessary to show that these were the particular general

22

ledgers that this company had.

23

seems to me.

24
25

HR. ALITOj

Quite a difference, it

Put in honoring the subpoena, the

witness is not vouching for the accuracy of the contents

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

of the documents.

2

documents —

3

He is simply saying, I have these

QUESTION:

Mell, he is saying, these are the

4

documents described in the subpoena, and then up until

5

now they have been in my custody.

6

saying.

7

the documents are produced.

8

9

That is what he is

So you are not going to argue about that after

ME. ALITO:

If there is some question about

whether he has possession of the documents, then I

10

suppose the act of production would be incriminating,

11

but in the case of standard business records, where it

12

is a foregone conclusion that the company has those

13

records, I don’t think it amounts to testimonial

14

self-incrimination.

15

But in any event, that was not the point that

16

I intended to press here this morning.

The point that

17

we want to make clear is — that we would like the Court

18

to address is that a person in respondent's position has

19

no basis for asserting a Fifth Amendment claim based on

20

the act of production when act of production immunity is

21

tender ed.

22

Now, if that argument is self-evident, that --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I take it you hope that this is the

only trouble we are going to have with your submission.
ME. ALITO:

I certainly hope so.

2

QUESTION:

Well, you don't need the Supreme

Court of the United States to tell you that.

3

HE. ALITO:

Kell, many of the lower courts

4

have had difficulty with that problem.

In this case,

5

the Court of Appeals held that the contents of these

6

documents were privileged.
QUESTION :

That is the major issue here, I

9

QUESTION:

And that is really what you want

10

reversed, isn't it?

7

8

take it.

NR. ALITO:

11
12

we want reversed.
QUESTION:

13
14

That is the principal thing that

I guess we should let you argue

that.

15

MR. ALITO:

All right.

16

(General laughter.)

17

MR. ALITO:

On the question of the contents,

18

whether the contents of the records are privileged, we

Now,

I would quickly add that there are

undoubtedly certain highly personal documents — a diary

is perhaps the best example — that may well be

12

protected by other provisions of law, the Fourth

Amendment or the First Amendment, but not by the Fifth

The Court of Appeals and respondent attempted

18

to distinguish Fisher on two grounds, authorship and

19

ownership of the papers, and we think neither of these

distinctions make sense either under Fisher's reasoning

or under a protection of privacy rationale taken from

23

Under Fisher, of course, what matters is

whether the documents were voluntarily created, not who

insofar as Boyd stands for the proposition that private

HR . ALITO:

I think there were two reasons for

3

the long string of statutes for immunity for actual

4

testimony.

5

enacted beginning, I think, in 1863, most of the

6

questions that have now been answered about immunity

7

were still unanswered, about the scope of immunity, the

8

circum stances in which a witness was required to claim

9

the Fifth Amendment privilege, and so forth, and so the

One was that when these first started to be

10

statutes were an attempt to address those questions, and

11

of course it took a long time to sort out the answers.

12

The other reason is that in the case of

13

immunity for testimony, at least the procedures that

14

have almost invariably been built into the statute

15

worked to protect the government, because of the serious

16

taint problems that can arise when immunity is given for

17

testimony.

uncertainty than he is when a state court orders him to

MR. PHILIPS:

That is my understanding as to

the testimonial nature of the act of production as

discussed in Fisher.

In Fisher, the Court found that

are in existence.

this is an attempt by the government to link up my

client with these proprietorships, and that the

no evidence that these documents are in existence.

7

Well, why would your client say

that the very existence of the documents would tend to

In any event,

the point is that

the government never did use the statutory immunity

QUESTION;

Are you asking for enforcement of

the subpoenas?

13

MR. ALITO;

We are asking for the judgment to

be vacated below, and the judgment below merely quashed

15

the subpoenas.

It didn't enforce them.

QUESTION;

16

Well, if you vacate a

judgment but

17

refuse to enforce the subpoena, presumably you have to

18

write something about why you are vacating the judgment,

1

and when you write that, ought the Court to discuss

20

whether the subpoena should have been enforced or not?
MB. ALITO;

21

Yes, and what I am saying is that

22

if it is made clear that on remand a grant of statutory

23

immunity would obviate Fifth Amendment objections, that

24

would

maintain that in the limited area of act of production
