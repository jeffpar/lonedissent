MR. FHILLIFS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court;
The issue in these consolidated cases is

9
10

whether Section 613A of the Internal Revenue Code
permits a lessor of oil and gas property who receives an

12

advance payment upon the execution of a lease, the

3

advance payment either in the form of a lease bonus cr

4

an advance royalty, is entitled to a percentage

5

depletion deduction against those royalties even though

6

no oil or gas allocated to that income is produced

7

during the taxable year.
The facts in both of these cases are not

8
9

disputed.

In the Farmer case in 1976 taxpayers leased

20

the mineral estate of lands they owned in Texas to two

21

com panies 'interested in oil and gas exploration.

22

Fart of the compensation for that agreement

23

was a substantial lease bonus to be paid in

24

installments, and that was in no way dependent upon the

25

actual production of oil or gas.

Instead, it was based

Taxpayers also included in that agreement a

6

royalty was paid.

7

Taxpayers in their 1976 federal income tax

8

returns claimed a 22 percent depletion deduction for

9

both the lease bonus payment and the royalty.

In the

properties they had in Wyoming to producers in return

In both of these cases the Commissioner

21

assessed a deficiency by disallowing the percentage

that had no relationship to any actual production during

Nr. Phillips, even after 1975 are

Yes, Your Honor.

We do not

dispute that decision in this case.
QUESTION*

10

Well, is there anything in the

11

statute we are talking about here or the amendments that

12

specifically changes the definition of gross income to

13

exclude bonuses and advance royalties or that overrules

14

Herring?
MR. PHILLIPS*

15

Nothing that expressly does

16

that.

Congress did add Subsection D to Section 613 in

17

1975.

Subsection D says you do not start with Section

18

613 which is the provision that forces you to look at

19

gross income.

20

Section 613A and only for so much of the production as

21

you can demonstrate satisfies the requirements of

22

Section 613A do you then come back into Section 6 13 and

23

apply the gross income tests under Herring and for that

24

matter all of the Commissioner's rulings regarding gross

25

income.

Instead it says that you look first at

QUESTIONS

Well, Congress did not change the

2

definition of gross income is what you are saying, but

3

it did state that the deduction for percentage depletion

4

had to be with respect to production.

5

HR. PHILLIPS;

QUESTION;

That is right, Your Honor.

New is the statutory language net

Well, of course, that is not
They are seeking to assent the

Well, I am asking you if that is

not a better application of this statutory language?
HR. PHILLIPS;

14

Well, I will concede that that

15

is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory

16

language.

17

Section 613A on production in the taxable year seems to

18

expect that that is the taxable year that they focus

19

on.

20

production the Commissioner has concluded that Congress

21

simply did not intend for that to be subject to the

22

depletion allowance.

23

The Commissioner's view is that the focus in

When the income is acquired prior to actual

As I said, Justice, I think in this case where

24

the Seventh Circuit held that both interpretations are

25

reasonable I submit that you could probably make a

1

reasonable argument with regard to the hypothetical you

2

set, but I think it important to make clear that

3

regardless of how you decide your hypothetical you would

4

still deny the deduction for the taxpayers in these

5

cases.
QUESTION;

6

How about the converse?

What if

7

you have a deduction in one year and no income until the

8

next?

9

55S. PHILLIPS;

The Commissioner has taken the

10

position at least with respect to the hypothetical he

11

presented in his proposed regulations that if you have

12

say $100,000 of production in one year and $85,000 of

13

income in that year and $15,000 of income in the next

14

year he will permit you the $15,000 deduction in —

15

QUESTION;

16

not any production.

17

literally either.

18

In the next year even if there is
So he does not apply the statute

MR. PHILLIPS;

Not precisely.

I think the

19

exception made, for that — It is not clear that he would

20

allow that if all of the income were derived in a

21

separate year, only if a small portion is.

22

In addition, it is clear that that distinction

23

that the Commissioner has drawn is fully consistent with

24

the intention and purpose of Section 613A.

25

Congress* dominant concern was to assure the production

That is,

of oil and gas, the extraction of oil in hand and

2

certainly under the hypothetical that the Commissioner

3

has proposed you have production in hand so, therefore,

4

he has decided to go ahead and allow that.

5

taxpayers are likely to complain about the propopsed

regula tion.
QUESTION;

7

Certainly nc

Is it clear that he would net if

8

you have advance royalties in one year and the next year

you have production he would not allow the depletion of

HR. PHILLIPS;

11
12

That seems clear, yes, Your

Honor.

13

QUESTION;

He will not do that?

14

HR. PHILLIPS;

He will not do that.

He will

15

be allowed cost depletion for the income that you have

16

received in the prior year.

17

special advanatage frankly that is afforded through

18

percentage depletion.

QUESTION;

They will not allow the

Hr. Phillips, let me just be sure I

20

understood you correctly.

21

of Congress in granting this exemption was to be sure

22

there was some production of oil and gas unrelated to

23

any particular time period.

25

HR. PHILLIPS;

You said the dominant purpose

During the taxable year.

I

failed to say that, but I believe tht Congress’ dominant

concern was some production prior to the income.

2

think -- I'm sorry.

3

QUESTIO'!;

I

Go ahead.
I am just wondering about whether

4

there was this refinement of the general objective that

5

there must be some production during the lease term

6

which would be consistent with the old law and it really

7

would not make much difference whether you had a year

8

beginning or the end of the year lease where there was

9

no production whereas there is a difference under the

10

proposed regulations.
ME. PHILLIPSi

11

Well, of course, the proper

12

result

in this case does not really hang on whether cr

13

not the proposed regulations are consistent.

14

to me we are still dealing with this particular case

15

which is a situation where we have income and no

16

production.
QUESTION;

17

It seems

If there is no production during

18

the entire life of the lease even the taxpayer would

19

agree he would- have to give tack the -MR. PHILLIPS^

20

That is correct, but it seems

21

perfectly ‘consistent with the statute to expect that

22

Congress may have preferred to have production as

23

quickly as possible and net postpone it five to ten

24

yea

25

es.

QUEST ION;

One of the purposes of Congress was

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to discourage the practice cf leasing with an advance

2

royalty payment scheme?

3

HR. FHILLIPS;

Well, I think not to discourage

4

it particularly but simply not to provide the

5

extraordinary encouragement that percentage depletion

6

would otherwise grant.
QUESTIONS

7

It is correct, is it not, that the

8

Commissioner’s position will discourage this particular

9

form of lease?
MR. PHILLIPS;

10
11

it will not be as readily adopted but of course —
Which may in turn cause —

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. PHILLIPS;

14

Anybody other than a small

producer would not be —
QUESTION;

15
16

From the prior practice, yes,

That is right.

We are only talking

about small producers, but this may in turn make it more

17 difficult for small producers to enter into advantageous
18

leases.
MR. PHILLIPS; ‘ I do not think sc, Your Honor.

19

20 The small producer retains the very substantial
21

advantage ‘that comes when there is production on the

22

proper ty.

23

QUESTION;

Right, but he loses the advantage

24

if the lessee cannot assure him that there will be

25

production in the year in which he is first receiving

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

royalties.
MR. PHILLIPS;

2

That is correct.

But most

3

royalty owners I would imagine would still realize that

4

a small producer if there is reasonable likelihood of

5

production will offer the advantages of percentage

6

depletion that were not available if he used a large

7

producer so that all this does is make the large

8

producer small producer equal with regard to advance

9

payments from which no oil is produced and for which

10

Congress presumably had no real concern or interest in.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL

7

REVENUE AND THE RESPONDENT, UNITED STATES — CONTINUED
HR. PHILLIPS:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1975 Congress in the Tax Reduction Act

10
11

eliminated for the most part percentage depletion

12

allowance for oil and gas.

13

the percentage depletion allowance was no longer

14

contingent exclusively on the existence of gross

After 1975 the existence of

15 income .
16

Instead Congress added Subsection D to Section

17

613 which expressly requires the taxpayer to determine

18

availability of any deduction, percentage deduction that

19

is, under Section 613A first and then determine cn the

20

basis of whether you comply with the requirements of

21

Section 61'3A how much of the deduction generally

22

specified in Section 611 will be computed specifically

23

under Section 613.

24
25

Congress in Section 613A permitted percentage
depletion for a royalty owner such as the taxpayers in

13
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62M300

1

these cases who leased to an independent producer "with

2

respect to so much of the taxpayer’s average daily

3

production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the

4

taxpayer’s depletable oil and natural cas quantity."

5

Average daily production is determined by dividing the

6

aggregate production for the year by the number of days

7

in the taxable years.
The depletable quantity is an arbitrary number

8

9

that the Congress had set in order to limit the maximum

10

amount of production and the guarantee that the

11

producers were in effect small producers.

12

majority of the Tax Court held, Section 613A places

13

repeated emphasis on the concept of production, and

14

production itself commonly means extraction from the

15

ground and, therefore, it is fair to read the statutory

16

language itself as requiring actual production during

17

the taxable year, and accordingly the taxpayers in this

18

case who cannot attribute any of their income to actual

19

production during the taxable year are not entitled

20

under the plain meaning of the language of Section 613A

21

to a percentage depletion deduction.
QUESTION;

22

As the

Nr. Phillips, what do you make of

23

the language immediately preceding the critical section

24

where it says "with respect to".

25

that?

Are you familiar with

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

NR. FHILLIFSi

1

Cur view is that the

Yes

2

"with respect to" is the way to describe how much

3

production you get to use for the percentage depletion,

4

that is, you get with respect to so much production

5

depletion under 611 to be computed under Section 613.

6 The "with respect to" language is actually the pivotal
7

language in our mind in determining that production is

8

crucial because it is only with respect to so much

9 production that you are allowed any kind of a
10

depletion.
QUESTION:

11

12

I do net quite read it that way.

It says "except as provided in Subsection D the

13 allowance for depletion under Section 611

shall be

14

computed in accordance with Section 613 with respect to

15

so much of the taxpayers average daily production of

16

domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayers

17

depletable oil quantity."
That suggests to me that there may be other

18
19

instances of depletion allowance that are not embraced

20

within

21

that language.

Do you disagree with that?

'HR. PHILLIPS:

No, I agree with that.

It is

22

clear that it is with respect to both that you have to

23

have some production and with respect to sc much as does

24

not exceed the depletable quantity.

25

So anything over 200G barrels in 1975 will not

15
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

be with respect to which you can deduct under the

2

percentage depletion.

3

production it is with respect to zero production that

4

you are allowed the depletion.

5

language as saying with respect to whatever number

6

between 1 and 2000 barrels are produced by primary means

7

of extraction.

8

9

Just as if you do not have any

So I would read

that

Of course, the taxpayers are still entitled to
cost depletion under Section 612, but in our reading of

10

the plain meaning of the statute they are no longer

11

entitled to percentage depletion simply as a simple

12

arithmetic means.

13

production is zero divided by any number obviously

14

equals zero, and so with respect to how much production

15

is there a deduction the answer is zero.

16

That is, the numerator of aggregate

QUESTION;

hr. Phillips, does the Commissioner

17

require the lessees to capitalize lease bonus and

18

advance royalty payments that they make and to take a

19

percentage depletion allowance against them in the year

20

of actual production?

21

'HR. PHILLIPS;

Well, he does not permit them

22

— They have historically net been permitted to take the

23

lease bonus and advance royalty and deplete that, use

24

percentage depletion on that.

25

capitalize it as a straight deduction.

He does require them to

bonus and advance royalties are not subject to the

report in 1974.

That, by

We submit that the result compelled by the

6
7

statutory language is equally supported by the only

8

relevant legislative history in this case.

9

Reduction Act was passed out of the House committee in

10

1975 it contained no provision with regard to oil and

11

gas depletion, and an amendment on the House floor

12

completely abolished oil and gas depletion which passed.
The bill then went to the Senate.

13

When the Tax

Again,

the

14

Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill that again

15

contained no provision for oil and gas depletion, and on

16 the floor of the Senate was the amendment added that
17

conforms basically to Section 613A.
All of the courts that have considered this

18
19

issue below have concluded that reading the legislative

20

history in 1975 provides no useful insights into the

21

solution o'f the problem presented by these cases.

22

is, there is nothing in there that tells you how to

23

treat lease bonus and advance royalties.
However, in 1974 during the prior Congress,

1

four months prior to the date that the conference

2

committee announced the final Section 613A compromise,

3

the House considered legislation that had been proposed

4

by Wilbur Mills then the Chairman of the Ways and Means

5

Committee that is strikingly similar to Section 613A.

6

That legislation provided a percentage

7

depletion deduction that was permissible again with

8

respect to so much of the taxpayers average daily

9

production of domestic crude oil as in that bill did not

10

exceed 3000 barrels.

legislation was defined precisely as it is defined in

When that bill was reported out of committee

14

the House Ways and Keans Committee made the only

15

statement that is directly relevant to the appropriate

16

disposition of this case, and the House committee's

17

report states thus the deductcn applies to gross income

18

attributable to oil which is sold or removed from the

19

premises and not to other types of depletable income.

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, does any of the

on Herring is?
MR. PHIILIFSs

Is that it obviously did net

3

require Congress to have considered the prior law in

4

order to change that law.

5

statute that is just completely inconsistent with the

6

basic ground rules that gave rise to the Herrino

7

decision which we submit it did, then Herring is just no

8

longer appropriate as a basis for decision.

9

The House committee report says expressly, for

10 example, a lease bonus paid
11

If it adopts language in the

to the lessor of mineral

lands in a lump sum or in installments is independent of

12 any actual production from the lease and thus would not
13

be within any of the exemptions.

14

inconsistent with Herring, and it is clear that Congress

15

meant to change the rules that income alone was no

16

longer the basis for percentage depletion.

17

necessary now is actual production and that in the

18

taxable year.

19

That is directly

What was

I take it as self-evident frankly that if that

20

legislative statement had been included by the Senators

21

who proposed the amendment in 1975 on the floor of the

22

Senate that these cases would not be here today.

23

is simply no way to mask the clear intent of the House

24

Ways and Means Commitee four months before this actual

25

legislation was passed with regard to exactly what this

There

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

language means, and it is the with respect to the

2

taxpayers average daily production that is the pivctal

3

language in the 1975 legislation, and under our theory

4

that is precisely the same language that the House Ways

5

and Keans Committee was interpreting in 1974.
We submit there is simply no justification for

6

7

doing as the Seventh Circuit did to disregard the only

8

clearly relevant legislative history we have to tell us

9

what that statute meant and intended in the cases we

10

have before us today, nor indeed do we believe that such

11

an extraordinary result as the Seventh Circuit reached

12

can be justified simply on the basis that Congress

13

failed to make reference to the prior law with regard to

14

lease bonuses and advance royalties in 1975.
QUESTION;

15

Hr. Phillips, can I interrput you

16

one second.

17

legislative history you are relying on, say you had a

18

five-year lease with a five-year lease bonus paid in

19

five installments, equal installments, and there was

20

production in the first four years of the lease but not

21

in the fifth.

22

the fifth installment of the lease bonus under your

23

view?

In looking at the language from the

1974

9

QUESTIONi

So that when we are looking at
*

10 lease bonuses we do not care whether there is production
11

12

or not.
ME. PHILLIPS;

That is correct, Your Honor.

I

13 believe that is a fair interpretation of the House
14
15

committee's report.
The Seventh Circuit believed that it could

16

reach a contrary result.

17

reaching its decision first stated that under the

18

statutory language the Commissioner's interpretation was

19

perfectly reasonable.

20

The Seventh Circuit in

Under the legislative history in 1975 the

21

Commissioner's interpretation was perfectly reasonable.

22

That recognized that the 1974 legislative history if

23

considered provided

24

Commissioner's interpretation, and it blinded itself to

25

all of that and decided the case on the basis of the

substantial support for the

failure of Congress in

3

1975 to expressly state that it

In the context of what Congress was doing in

4

1975 that simply ignores the reality of that

congressional session.

6

between the time that the Senate proposed the amendment

Congress acted within six days

7 and the House committee — Excuse me, the House-Senate
8

conference committee adopted the compromise solution to

9

this proposal that that legislation came out.

10
11

In the context of eliminating almost all
percentage depletion allowance it is just simply net

12 reasonable to assume that anyone would have worried
13

about this very small portion of the problem of

14

percentage depletion.

15

depletion simply was in no way contingent on the

The future of percentage

16 treatment of the royalty owner's advance royalties and
17
18

lease bonuses.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to rely cn

19 the failure to make comment in 1975 as the hasis for
20

deciding this case.

In 1975 Congress was reacting to a

21

severe oil shortage which caused the price of

22

deregulated oil to skyrocket.

23

It responded by eliminating the extraordinary

24

tax advantages that percentage depletion had previously

25

granted in most situations.

Congress decided to

440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

continue to give some depletion protection to

2

independent producers, but it quite reasonably withheld

3

the percentage depletion advantage to situations where

4

oil was actually extracted during that taxable year and

5 even then only so long as the amounts reflected a small
6

producer.
In all other situations Congress simply

relegated the taxpayer to the cost depletion that most

9

other taxpayers are able to use in most of their

10

industries.

11

latter.

Taxpayers here were entitled to the

They were not entitled to the former.
The federal circuit correctly so held, and its

judgment in Farmar should be affirmed.

I am

just wondering how important the words "lease bonus" are

MR. PHILLIPS;

Sure, but if that is not done

makes clear that you ought not to be entitled to the

19

percentage deduction in that year.

20

QUESTION;

The thing that troubles me about

21

your emphasis on years are if I understand the papers

22

correctly there are situations in which you would agree

23

that in a fifth year of a lease there could be a

24

depletion allowance based on production during earlier

25

years in the lease, a fifth year in which there was no

The

Commissioner's proposed regulation does suggest that

conceded, but it dees seem to me that the notion of

allowing the deduction in that situation is fully

I think it will have some

QUESTIO??;

Mr. Phillips, if you look at the

14

conference committee report because this language was

15

added in a floor amendment so we do not have a lot of

16

history to go by and if you just look at the conference

17

committee report for the language that was actually

18

adopted, there is no indication that Congress intended

19

to amend the definition of gross income from property.

MR. PHILLIPS;

21

QUESTION;

22

23

just is not there.

I do not believe --

Cr to change the prior result.
You cannot find it.

MR. PHILLIPS;

It seems to me there are two

24

answers to that.

First, we are not arguing that the

25

definition of gross income from property has been

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

interpretation.
Second of all it seems perfectly unreasonable

3
4

to assume that the conference committee six days after

5

the Sanate amendment would be sitting down trying to

6

sort out these problems.

The problems that the

7 conference committee addressed itself to were twofold.

First, the conference said we are going to

8
9

keep percentage depletion at 22 percent.

That is how we

10

resolved the difference between the House and the Senate

11

version.
Second of all, we are going to keep the

12

depletable quantity at 2000 barrels.

difference between the 3000 and the 1000 barrel

15

proposals that were in the Senate.

You would expect that in the conference they

10

how they were resolved, and

that is all the conference

That makes sense in context, but that

20 is not basis for saying that our interpretation should
21

not be adopted simply because Congress did not go

22

further and explain every other problem that might

23

exist.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it also indicated that it

retain the percentage depletion at 22 percent for 20C0

barrels.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. DONNELLY, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF CF THE RESPONDENT, ENGLE
MR. DONNELLY;

19
20

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
T represent the Engles who are the Respondents

21

22

in No.

82-599.

The Engles received $76C0 in advance

23

royalties in 1975, a year in which there was no

24

production in the sense of physical extraction from the

25

oil and gas properties that were involved.

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) «28-9300

1

The Engles nevertheless claimed under the

2

independent producer exemption Section 613A(c) of the

3

Revenue Code which was added under the Tax Reduction Act

4

of

1975 the percentage depletion allowance.

The Tax

5 Court decided against the Engles' position findino that
6

the statute had overruled the decision of the Herring

7

case and required production, that is, that the payment

8

must be directly related to production.
The Seventh Circuit reversed finding that

9
10

there was no production requirement imposed by the

11

statute but rather that the statute imposed a limitation

12 only on the amount that would be eligible for the
13

deduction in effect defining who is the small

14

independent producer that was to have available tc him a

15

continuing percentage depletion allowance though

16

Congress had intended to eliminate the depletion

17

allowance for the large oil company .

18

It is the Engles'

position that the language

19

in Section 613A which requires the deduction to be

20

computed in accordance with Section 613 requires that

21

the deduction be based only on gross income from the

22

property.

23

the property.

24
25

The advance royalties are gross income from

There is nothing in Section 613A that says
that the deduction is to be calculated on the value of

production, and Mr. Fhillips' position would suggest

2

that the calculation is to be based on the value of

3

production.

Since we contend that prior law was to be

4 retained for the small independent producer, a brief

5
6

summary of prior law would be in order.
Under the Herring case there was no production

requirement.

8

eligible for percentage depletion in the same manner as

12

lease there had not been production sufficient to

13

justify the advance royalty or lease bonus, then under

14

the tax benefit rule the amount of depletion previously

15

claimed would be recaptured.

16

QUESTION:

If by the termination of the

Mr. Donnelly, would it not be a

17 reasonable position for the Commissioner to require that
18

the deduction -- Even if you are right about the fact

19 that bonuses and advance royalties are part of gross
20

income,, would it not be reasonable for the Commissioner

21

to require that the deduction be taken in the year of

22

actual production?

23

MR. DONNELLY:

Well, I think that would be

24

reasonable, but under the statute cannot be done.

The

25

percentage depletion allowance can only be taken in the

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1
2

year in which the proceeds or the money is received.
It has to be based on the gross income from

3

the property.

There is a limitation contained in

4

Section 613 that it may not exceed 50 percent of the net

5

income from the property so that the deduction, its

6 calculation requires that it be taken in the year in

7 which the money is received for cash basis taxpayers.
8

It would have been reasonable I think for

9 Congress to have drafted the statute so that at the time
*

10 there is production the depletion allowance be taken.
11

QUESTION*

Well then maybe that is what

12 Congress did do.
13
14

HR. DONNELLY*

Well, Congress -- You see under

the 1974 bill that Hr. Phillips referred to there was no

15 requirement that the calculation be made in accordance
16 wth Section 613.
17

That, however, is in the 1975 bill.

The statute does not say compute the deduction

18 with respect to the barrelage amount allowed under
19 Section 613A(c)(1)(a).

It says the calculation is to be

20 made in accordance with Section 613, that is, with
21

respect to' the gross income from the property on sc much

22

of the production as does not exceed the barrel

23

limitation.

24
25

Our position, of course, all along has been
zero production does net exceed 2000 barrels.

If we had

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

zero production and we had gross income from the

2

property# the calculation is simply to be based on the

3

gross income from the property.

4

Only in the event that our production should

5

exceed

2000 barrels a day would the limitation come into

6

play.

We believe that we are indeed then what Congress

7

intended to define as a small independent producer.
The statutory history, I think, has been

8
9

given, and we believe that since the independent

10

producers exemption was inserted into the law as a

11

result of the Senate amendment that the Senate committee

12

report is of particular relevance.

13

indicates that it was the intention to retain percentage

14

depletion for the small independent producer.

That report

We believe that this meant that prior law was

15
16

to be retained as to the calculation of the exemption

17

for the small independent producer, that the words "in

18

accordance with Section 613” fully reflect the intention

19

of Congress to make the calculation in accordance with

20

prior law.
QUESTION;

21

Hr. Donnelly, can I ask you a

22 question?
23

HR. DONNELLY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

It will reveal my ignorance, but is

there another definition of the term "small independent

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

2

MB. DONNELLY:

3

QUESTIONS

4

MR. DONNELLY;

5

No.

This is what defines it.
This is the definition.

The

statute prevents large retailers and large refiners and

6 large producers if you fall into any one cf those
7 categories from being eligible for the small independent
8 producer exemption.

The intent was to eliminate percentage

9
10

depletion for the large oil company.
QUESTION:

11

Explain this to me then.

Why would

12 this language not permit one of the giant oil companies
13

to tak-e this deduction to the extent that their

14

production did not exceed this limit?
MR. DONNELLY;

15

Well, most of the giant oil

16 companies are retailers and

refiners or one of the two.

17

If you are a retailer or a refiner you cannot use the

18

small independent producer exemption.
If you are a producer only the oil company

19
20

would be eligible for the exemption within the

21

limitations of the small independent producer

22

exemption.

23

QUESTION;

Sc the only meaning of the word

24

"small" is that if you are otherwise an independent

25

producer ' then you may take depletion up to the maximum

35

QUESTION *

4

ME. DONNELLY;

That is correct.

If production limits do not

5

exceed

6

and you are entitled to the full depletion —

that total, you are considered a small producer

QUESTION*

7

It seems to me that tends tc

8

support your view that this is a limit rather than a

9

basic condition for eligibility.

that.

In the case of our client, our

price of oil as it existed in 1975.

17

day as compared to the 20C0 which the statute allows.

That would have

But you do not say, do you, that if

19

there is never any production that you can have

payments?
MR. DONNELLY;

Justice White, we recapture.

MR . DONNELLY;

QUESTION;

So as to avoid recapture.

Okay.
Right.

Your answer is yes.

It is the same

14 precondition that existed before 1975?
15

MR. DONNELLY;

That is correct.

16

The effect of the government's position on us

17

I think can be expressed by an example.

18

that there were £7600 in advance royalties received in

19

1975, a 5 percent royalty rate and no physical

20

extrac ticn.

21

Let us assume

In 1976 $200,000 in value of oil is extracted

22

from the property.

£10,000 then in royalty would have

23

been earned, 5 percent of $200,000.

24

The $7600 advance would be offset against the

25

£10,000 earned and the balance of $2400 would be owing.

1976 because there was no gross

7

under the government's position in this case we would

get no percentage depletion during that year either;

9

however, Mr. Phillips has said

that the government would

10

condescend in that year because there had been prior

11

production to grant depletion on a reasonable quantity

12 whatever that is, whatever he may mean by that, the
13

gross income from the property which is paid during that

year.
We think the statute does not work as to

The government attempts tc convert the

statutory language which imposes merely a limitation

21

the government attempted to do at the time of Herring

some 50 years aco to impose a production requirement,

We represent two taxpayer ranchholders in west

installment bonuses.
They received a part of their installment in

14

leases.
Not only is that a differentiation that one

15
16

In that same year they also received a royalty

should note as a fact but also there is actual proof in

17 this case that as the amount of the bonus goes up the
18

amount of the percentage royalty goes down and vica

19

versa.

As a matter of economic logic that must be.
May I digress from what I would otherwise say

20
21

to perhaps address what Justice Stevens was asking

22

about.

23

that a

25

certainty of income regardless of the depletion

There is a very pertinent point to be realized

2

he cannot afford to gamble cn the royalty that might

ultimately be greater if he said forget the bonus and I

4

will take the greater royalty in the future.

5

Now with respect to the reply brief of the

6

government which was filed just a week ago, we believe

7

it would be profitable to spend a few moments on that

8 reply brief, and in that connection we respectfully ask
9

the Court if it should choose to do so to look at the

10

copies of Section 613A and the bill in 1974.

11

it might be more convenient for the Court if it could

12

lay those two down side by side because what that shews

13

one when it is done it — Section S13A, and it is

14

unfortunate they put a cap "A” there because of a

15

section reference.

16

but a 613 cap A.

17

We thought

It is net a small "a” in parantheses

QUESTION;

Mr. Collie, are you referring to a

particular point in the briefs here that you would like

19

to have us look at?

20

MR. COLLIE;

Sir, Justice Rehnquist, what I am

21

referring 'to is where the brief says there is remarkable

22

similarity between the 1974 bill and the Act that came

23

out as 613A.

24

then I would like to compare it to the other bill and

25

show the difference.

If we could look at the Act for a moment

QUESTION:

7

MR. COLLIE:

8
9

It

That is 93 in your case.
In application for certiorari in

my case, yes, sir.
The point that we desire to make is that

10

Section 613A says that without regard to Section 613,

11

the old Act granting depletion, we will have two

12

exceptions.

13

gas wells and then it starts off with respect to the

14

exception for certain gas wells with this very important

15

language, this clinching language.

16

mentioned two types of natural gas that will still get

Section 613."
Now why did Congress choose that

3

cross-reference, this webb of cross-references that it

4

has woven into the fabric of the Internal Revenue Code?

5

It is because Congress wanted to tell us that we wanted

6

to go back to 613.

7

We want all of the law, the regulations, the

8

baggage, the decisions of this Court including Herring

9

in order that we can see when we go to the limitation

10

that Congress meant for this Court to look and meant for

11

the administration of the Internal Revenue Service tc

12

look at what it has said before over a period of 50

13

years with respect tc Secticn 611 through Section 613.

14

That is the important thing.

When the

15

legislative history of the prior bill in 1974 is

16

referred to by the government and saying that there it

17

said you cannot have the bonus, the depletion on the

18

bonus, look what that bill says.

19

anything, not a word, about a cross-reference to Section

20

611, not a word about a cross-reference to Section 613.

21

There is the all-impcrtant difference between

Now a moment more about legislative history if

2

3

legislative history should be relevant here.

4

original briefs of the government they cited us three

5

cases saying that we should look back from one Congress,

6

the Congress in

1975 to a prior Congress in 1974

They cited two cases.

7

In the

.

In our briefs we shewed

8

that neither of those cases were applicable.

Now they

9

come along with the Dahlaheight case, the famous Texas

10

City disaster case involving the Federal Tort Claims

11

Act.

12

In that case this Court considered a prior

13

legislative, report to the Congress that enacted the Tort

14

Claims Act.

15

bill in the prior Congress was exactly the same and the

16

legislative report was exactly the same word for word.

17

The only reason 'they leaped forward back a year is

18

because they wanted to pick up some testimony with

19

respect to the. prior bill because the bill that was

20

actually enacted never had any legislative hearings.

21

But why?

It was because the statute, the

Therefore, we respectfully submit that it had

22

absolutely no support for going back into a prior

23

Congress as to a bill that was never enacted.

24

Your Honors, in the situation the government

25

would have us look at here we had a bill that came out

It was never referred to again in any place.
The danger as the Congressional Record shows

is of doing such a thing as that aside from the vaccuum

They would simply apply the same technique that the

nothing more than he does today with respect to cost

depletion in order to allocate this percentage depletion

that he takes on his bonus over the actual production

that he may receive in the future, and of course as

the future the percentage depletion evaporates.

MR . COLLIE :

2

QUESTIONi

Lastly —
Hr. Collie, before you go on do I

3

understand that you think that it would be appropriate

4

to require the deduction then to be taken in the year of

5

the actul production?

6

MR. COLLIEi

No, ma'am.

I think, Justice

7

O'Connor, it would be appropriate to take the percentage

8

depletion deduction in the time of the receipt of the

9

dollar.

It is possible to devise a method to take the

10

deduction at a later period of time, but I do not

11

believe that is in accordance with the teaching of the

12

Herring case which we believe is still vital and was not

13

destroyed .

14

QUESTIONi

Well would it not be consistent

15

with it and be a reasonable interpretation that the

16

Commissioner could make?

17

MR.. COLLIEs

18

QUESTIONi

Yes, ma’am.
So perhaps even if we agreed with

19

you on the gross income issue it should be remanded

21

Commissioner on that?

22

MR. COLLIEs

2

QUESTION*

Well, maybe we could disabuse him

of that position in the process.
SR. COLLIEs

3

I would hope, of course, the

4 Court would, yes. Your Honor.

Lastly, we would respectfully call the

5

6 attention of the Court to the fact that the Farmars and
7

the Suggs had actual production during the year of the

8 receipt of their bonus and so there is absolutely
9

nothing in the statute that says that they cannot

10

combine these two types of gross incomes from the

11

property.

12

The gross income that is truly gross income

13

from the property in the form of a bonus and the dollars

14

they recieve from the percentage royalty, I put the two

15

together and take their percentage depletion upon that.

16

You can easily combine them and see whether or not the

17

limitation had been violated.

18

So, therefore, we have an even, simplistic

19

method of applying the statute.

20

are suggesting conform with all of the decisions, the

21

mosaic, almost Grecian mosaic that this Court worked out

22

with respect to percentage depletion on bonuses over a

23

very long period of time.

24
25

What the taxpayers here

It conforms with what Congress intended for
the small producer.

It is simple.

A very large producer.

It is an

stuff, which produced ten barrels on December 31, or the

thereafter.

14

Would it get the full deduction under ycur

HR. COLLIE:

Yes, sir, but then it would have

15

to be spread over the large production if I understand

16

the question correctly in the later years and it would

17

immediately violate the 3000 or 2000 barrel limit and

18

you would immeidatley in the next year restore a part of

19

the depletion deduction to income.

20

In other words, you estimate your recoverable

21

reserves, Your Honor, and then you spread that -- Say

22

you are going to get 1000 barrels — I mean a million

23

since we are dealing with big figures a million barrels

24

a year for the next ten years.
