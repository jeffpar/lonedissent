CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We"will hear arguments

3

first in Kathy Keeton against Hustler Magazine.

4

Grutman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

MR. GRUTMAN:

Mr.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether or

8

not the sovereign State of New Hampshire's long-arm

9

statute is to be denied enforcement under the due

10

process clause despite the conduct of Hustler in

11

circulating its magazines in New Hampshire out of which

12

a cause of action for libel arose.

13

question was part of a series of unprovoked calumnies

14

and vilifications heaped upon the Plaintiff acusing her

15

of among other things licentious promiscuity and having

16

a venereal disease which in any jurisdiction would be

17

tantamount to libel per se.

18

The libel in

The law suit was initially instituted in the

19

state court of Ohio in 1977 where there appeared

to be

20

no question about obtaining personal jurisdiction over

21

both Mr. Flynt personally and his magazine.

22

outset of the litigation Ohio specifically applied its

23

own statute of limitations to dismiss the libel claim

24

while upholding the viability of Plaintiff's claim for

25

invasion cf privacy.

At the

3

Reiving upon that determination for several

1

2

years thereafter Plaintiff continued to vigorously

3

prosecute her case in Ohio until on the night before

4

trial was to commence the Ohio trial court reversed

5

itself and applied the New York statute of limitations

6

reparable to the cause of action for invasion of privacy

7

and dismissed the Plaintiff's case entirely out of

8

court.

9

After the Plaintiff's appeal was affirmed by

10

the Ohio Appellate Court Plaintiff promptly brought a

11

diversity law suit in New Hampshire serving the

12

Defendants under the New Hampshire lcng-arm statute

13

which the New Hampshire Supreme Court has interpreted as

14

being intended to be extended as far as the Constitution

15

will permit under the due process clause.

10

The District Court found that while the New

17

Hampshire long-arm statute was satisfied due process

18

forbad entertaining the action and it dismissed it

19

giving two reasons:

20

contacts with the State of New

21

lack of New Hampshire's interest in the litigation.

Plaintiff's lack of connections or

The FirstNCircuit affirmed without disturbing

23

the District Court's evaluation of the Defendant's

24

presence in New Hampshire as regular, systematic and

25

continuous because of the monthly circulation of

seeking to exploit the New Hampshire market place which

2

took place on a continuing basis since 1975.

The reason

3 or the reasoning of the First Circuit in affirming is
4

epitomized in the catchy phrase at the conclusion of its

5

opinion in which it said the New Hampshire tail is too

6

small to wag so large an out of state dog.

7

The phrase captures what we submit to this

8

Court is the essential misconception of the lower courts

g

in assuming that jurisdiction turns on a little more or

10

£ little less of Plaintiff's contacts and damage in the

11

forum overlooking that for 38 years since this Court's

12

opinion in International Shoe the jurisdictional inquiry

13

has always focused on the contacts of the defendant, not

14

the plaintiff.

\

15

He submit to the Court that insofar as the

18

assertion that jurisdiction is to be determined there

17

are essentially three levels by which or three tiers by

18 which a determination can be made.

If a defendant by

ig

its continuous, systematic process can be said to be

20

doing business then it is dogmatic that general

21

jurisdiction exists in that forum for litigation against

22

that defendant for all kinds of causes of action.

23

We do not argue in this case that we fall

24

within that rubric.

We submit that synthesizing all of

25

the cases in which this Court has spoken from

International Shoe through Hr* Justice White’s opinion

in World-Wide Volkswagen.

3

QUESTION:

4

KR. GRUTMAN:

5

Hr. Justice White.

6

That was the Court’s opinion.
The Court’s opinion written by

Forgive me.

The synthesis of those cases holds that where

7

you have purposeful conduct by a defendant directed at

8

the forum in question and out of which conduct the cause
\

9

of action arises or is generated that satisfies the

10

formula of those minimum contacts which substantial

11

justice and reasonable fair play make it suitable that a

12

defendant should be hailed into that court and be

13

amenable to suit in that jurisdiction.

14

QUESTION:

I am a little surprised, Mr.

15

Grutman.

16

came after International Shoe.

17

brief but not in —

18

You do not make much of the Boxite case which

MR. GRUTMAN:

You cited in your reply

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

^he

19

Bcxite case as I interpret it has to do with the failure

20

of the defendant who by its waiver to its failure to

21

comply with orders of the court to demonstrate its

22

non amenability to suit was found by the Court in

that

23 case to have subjected itself to a determination that
24

facts could be found against it so that jurisdiction

25

could be properly assessed against that defendant.

QUESTION*

But it certainly bears on

2

World-Wide Volkswagen.

3

H5. GRUTMAN*

I think it does, but I think

4

that Volkswagen in its facts and in the more expansive

5

treatment in the Court’s opinion is a case which I think

6

provides the springboard from which the Court can find

7

in this lawsuit that what you hare present in this case

8

and what was lacking in Volkswagen.

9

had purely adventitious or fortuitous circumstances by

In Volkswagen you

10

which jurisdiction was asserted against a little

11

automobile dealer in Mesena , New York whose only

12

business was in Nesena, Maw York and who had no

13

connection with the State of Oklahoma.

14

Similarly the tri-state regional dealer albeit

15

under the name World-Wide Volkswagen it unlike Hustler

18

in this case in no way for its economic advantage did

17

business in Oklahoma or sold its products in Oklahoma.

18

As I read what the Court was saying and what your

19

opinion I think pointed to Mr. Justice Blackmun is that

20

you were looking for in the conduct of the defendant

21

willful, purposeful economic activity.

22

Now that is clearly present in this case as it

23

relates to Hustler because Huslter in the Court’s

24

opinion directly or indirectly was responsible on a

25

systematic basis from 1975 for sending copies of its

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

magazines into Sew Hampshire out of which the record

2

shows they derived substantial economic benefit running

3

into millions of dollars.
That was not one insurance policy which this

4
5

Court found sufficient in McGee v. International

6

Insurance.

7

sv«ep of this Court’s opinions on jurisdiction starting

8

with the germinal case of International Shoe and running

9

through World-Side Volkswagen into the Bcxite case I

That was a 1957 case and again tracing the

10

think the Court has acknowledged that we are seeing an

11

expansion of jurisdiction since the second World War in

12

recognition of the changing facts of life in American

13

society.

14

I say that on the second level of analysis

15

which our reply brief attempted to explicate for the

16

Court we believe that we are squarely within the

17

philosophical underpinnnings by which this Court has

18

formulated those circumstnaces in which jurisdiction can

19

properly he laid, and again

the conduct of the defendant.

T say the focus must be on

Respondent’s briefs tend to castigate us by

22

opprobrious references to so-called forum shopping,

23

which, while it is sort of a pungent phrase, seems tc

24

lose sight of the fact that it is not the plaintiff that

25

creates the forum, it is the defendant, by his conduct

in the forum
QUESTION*

Of course, a nationwide publisher

3

creates a forum, presumably, in almost any state, and I

4

suppose it has always been libel plaintiff's position

5

that they are perfectly at liberty to shop.

6

MR. GRUTMANi

7

QUESTION!

8
9

They are what?

They are perfectly at liberty to

shop in that kind of —
MR. GRUTMAN;

I think that is absolutely

10

correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because libel is a

11

peculiar kind of a tort, and when we are dealing with

12

media defendants that are nationwide in the scope of the

13

economic activities that they pursue, seeking the

14

benefits of the marketplace nationwide, they have the

15

unique ability of simultaneously creating the harm which

16

the libel causes in all of the places where the

17

publication is disseminated.

18

Now, the publications have the benefit of the

19

single publication rule.

That is a rule which I think

20

is uniformly recognized throughout the country in which

21

the plaintiff is required to prove all of her damage or

22

all of his damage in whichever forum the case is

23

properly brought, but if one were to look at that from

24

the standpoint of the publisher, what should the

25

publisher do in the event of concern with statutes cf

1

limitations or the special niche which this Court has

2

carved oat for media defendants in libel cases?
This Court in its decisions beginning with

3
4

Sullivan and working through Gertz against Welsh in the

5

evolution of the public figure doctrine, has established

6

that the states, so long as they do not create liability

7 without fault, may establish standards whrch are
8

different.

State A may say that it is gross

9

negligence.

State B may say that it is simple

10

negligence.

State C may say it is the malice standard.

11

Now, assuming that we have a publication, of whatever

12

nature, whether it is acceptable or presumably

13

reputable, if a harm occurs nationwide, then

14

conscientious and responsible lawyering would require

15

that a plaintiff take cognizance of where it would be

10

most propitious to hring the lawsuit, and in that, I

17

think there is neither shame nor disgrace.

18

it is an incident of our federal system under the

19

peculiarity which adheres in defamation law.

I think that

The submission, may it please the Court, which

20
21

we make, is that we are squarely within all of your

prior holdings.

1

2

respondents that there must he, in order for

3

jurisdiction to be appropriate against an out of state

4

resident in an action such as this, a so-called state's

5

interest.

6

Well —
QUESTIQSs

Do you understand respondent’s

7

contention, in that regard to mean something more than

8

just the state of Hew Hampshire was willing to accept

9

this case in a state court?

T suppose it must, because

10

it is obvious that the state of New Hampshire would hav

11

accepted this case.

QUESTIONS

dimension, the- term states —

15

Precisely.

I do.

And —

So it must have a constitutional

HR. GRUTMAN*

I think that there is a

18 constitutional dimension, and it could primarily be

17

derived from the fact that an indispensable ingredient

18

of state sovereignty is the right of any state to

19

regulate intentional harm which takes place within the

20

perimeter of its geographical confines, particularly

21

where that harm is not unintentional.

22

QUESTION*

I meant that I thought the

23

respondent's contention that there must be a state

24

interest had a constitutional dimension to it.

25

HR. GRUTMAN;

Beyond what I have said,

I am

■ • t' .

3

is that your understanding of respondent's contention?

4

Nhen they talk about a state's interest, it isn’t just a

5

question of what New Hampshire wanted in this situation,

6

but that there are some limits on what New Hampshire can

7

do.

8
9

ME. GFUTMANi

I am not really sure that I can

agree with that, because I think that takes us into a

10

very murky area, where it would be extremely difficult

11

to predict or to understand

12

they want.

13

kind of a case, in a case in which you have something

14

less than purposeful conduct out of which the cause of

15

action arose, and you were looking to ascertain whether

16

jurisdiction could be affirmed, you would have to find

17

affiliating circumstances with the defendant plus a

18

so-called state interest.

19

what kind of state interest

Perhaps, Mr. Justice Eehnquist, in another

Now, that kind of a state interest, if you

20

look for it in this case, and it is to that to which I

21

address ray attention, is demonstrated, as we have set

22

forth in our reply brief, by the fact that New Hampshire

23

in 1971 amended its long arm statute so as to permit the

24

use of that statute for non-residents.

25

interpreted its long arm statute to permit the furthest

It has

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

reach permissible under due process

2

In Leaper versus Leaner, which was treated by

3

the First Circuit, New Hampshire said it had an interest

4

in protecting not only its residents but non-residents

5

against just such kinds of harm as are involved in a

6

case like this in libel, and lastly. New Hampshire,

7

expressing as another part of the cluster of its

8

evidences of its interest in this case, has a criminal

9

statute which makes it a misdemeanor if anyone

10

intentionally by falsehood holds someone up to the kind

11

of ridicule, calumny, and obliguy which 8r. Flynt did in

12

this case.

13

So, if you ask me in this case, because I am

14

not really entirely sure whether the respondents are

15

advocating that there should be a general grab-bag of

16

so-called state interests which are highly amorphous

17

that should be considered at every stage in all cases in

18

the equation of ascertaining if jurisdiction exists or

19

net, that is so far out of the question, I would prefer

20

for the purposes of the adjudication of this case to

21

confine myself simply to the facts of this case, and to

22

point out that if you are looking for state interest, it

23

is abundantly present in all of the indicia

24

have just alluded.

QUESTION*

It is — not only is it

4

alleged, it is conceded by the First Circuit that harm

occurred in Hew Hampshire.

6

QUESTIONS

That harm being?

7

MR. GROTMANj

The harm occurs in the

8

defamation itself, the negative reputation if she

9

doesnti have a positive reputation.

It is the libel,

10

the accusation, the psychic mayhem, which is what

11

Professor Tribe calls it, of simply disseminating

12

something which is itself a libel.
There is no requirement when you speak of

13
14

harm. Hr. Justice Brennan, as far as I understand it,

15

that the plaintiff has to demonstrate that she suffered

18

her principal injury or loss in that particular state,

17

sc long as some harm occurred there, and the harm by

18

definition under the restatement and under the law of

19

New Hampshire would be the circulation, not necessarily

20

where it was published, but. the circulation of something

21

which is libelous.

As I think — forgive me.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

MS. SHAPTROs

The states that have the

these are the states with a paramount interest, and

these are the states where the statute of limitations

QUESTIONi

We say

Mr. Shapiro, would not the New

6

Hampshire court have the authority if it found

7

jurisdiction to apply the statute of limitations of the

8

other states with respect tc the recovery?

9

MR. SHAPIRO*

One would think that the court

10

should cic such a thing, and that it would be reasonable

11

to do so, but the law in New Hampshire is that the

12

statute of limitations is procedural in nature, and that

13

the court therefore applies its own local statute of

14

limitations, bringing back to life a tort action that is

15

dead in the other 49 states where 99 percent of the

16

damages actually arose.
QUESTION*

17

Mr. Shapiro, if your concern is

18

with what you feel to be manipulation of statutes of

19

limitations, it seems to me that is not a jurisdictional

20

argument.

21

law, maybe constitutionally mandated choice of law.

22

That is perhaps an argument over choice of

MR. SHAPIRO:

We submit that the choice of the

23

forum here for the purpose of escaping the statute of

24

limitations in the 49 other states is indeed a

25

jurisdictional matter, because it implicates the

5

MR. SHAPIRO*

The answer is, Hr. Justice, that

6

we are talking about the selection of a reasonable forum

7

to litigate this particular dispute, and that requires

8

consideration of the location of the parties.

9

requires a consideration of the interests of the ether

states in the federal system, and to permit this

the policies of the ether states in the Union.

MR. SHAPIRO*

the complaint the way it is drafted as a nationwide

Justice, I am even doubtful about the constitutional

2

validity of sustaining this merely as a proceeding to

collect damages in the state of New Hampshire, in light

of the burdens on the parties that would be produced by

this sort of forum shopping, by the lack of direct state

interest compared to the interests of Sew York and Ohio ,

and by the other factors that this Court mentioned in

the Volkswagen case, which I would like to enumerate.

9

QUESTION*

Hr. Shapiro, I am afraid we are not

10

giving you much chance to argue your case, but you

11

suggest that the plaintiff has little or no interest

because she may not have been known in Hew Hampshire,

13

but let's assume that she was not known at all,

therefore had no favorable reputation there.

reputation in Hew Hampshire?

wrong, that any such interest is a very abstract

Doesn't the state have an interest

HR. SHAPIRO;

not just a matter of inferences about what the most

According to the restatement of

in a multi-state defamation proceeding are the state

24

where the plaintiff lives, the state, if there is

25

another state, where she has a more well established

domicile of the defendant, because the state is

responsible for the conduct of local residents, and the

4

principal place of business of the defendant.

These are the logical focuses of a multi-state

defamation case, and to say that the plaintiff is

in the Union without regard to

MR. SHAPIRO*

We think the Constitution says

2

something in addition to this, and that is that the

3

forum has to be a reasonable and a fair forum from the

4

point of view of all the parties, and from the point of

5

view of the other states in the federal system.

6

are two things that the due process clause guarantees, a

7

fair forum for the parties and the witnesses, and a

8

forum which is reasonable in light of the needs of the

9

other 49 states in the Union.

discussion of which states really do have a palpable

interest in a multi-state defamation case, and the place

if the Court were disposed to look at the case that way,

if it were to say in the opinion that damages are

restricted to the forum, which has a connection with the

parties, that would be a substantial contribution to

this body of law, and it would be a significant holding,

21

but if — our position still is that even if it was

that there are very serious constitutional questions

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SHAPIRO*.

Thank you.
The factors that this Court has

6

mentioned in its recent decisions are the forum’s

7

interest in deciding the dispute, the burden on the

8

defendant, the plaintiff's interest in convenient

relief, the judicial system's interest in efficient

20

disposition of suits, and the chared interests of all of

2

the states in efficient application of their own

22

substantive policies.

23

And we submit that each of these factors

24

weighs very heavily against the choice of forum in this

25

particular case.

The burden here on the defendants is a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. GROTSAN s

9

I would like to begin by responding to a

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

question which you put to my colleague, and pointing to

11

that place in the record, which is to be found at 15-A

12

of the appendix, where the First Circuit said, "The

13

major factor favoring plaintiff is that she is suing in

14

part far damages suffered in New Hampshire," which is an

15

acknowledgement of the fact that she did suffer injury

16

in New Hampshire, "and although the defendant's contacts

17

with New Hampshire are sparse, they were not random,

18

isolated, or transitory.

19

in circulating magazines throughout the state was

20

purposefully directed at New Hampshire.”

21

The general course of conduct

Counsel has spoken to the Court about that

22

state which has the paramount interest, and although the

23

language was written by Mr. Justice Brennan in his

24

dissent in Volkswagen, I do not think he was expressing

25

anything with which the Court would disagree when he

57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W„ WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

said that, "A defendant has no constitutional

entitlement to the best forum or, for that matter, to

any particular forum.

Under even the most restrictive

6

That is certainly the case in this lawsuit.

7

I promised that I would allude to something

8

Kr. Justice Stevens raised at the conclusion of

9

principal remarks, and I would like not to omit what I

10

was saying when I originally concluded, and that was

11

namely that the district court focused on the

12

plaintiff’s lack of contacts, and therefore they

13

reached the minimum contacts of Flynt or of his

14

publication, and they therefore dismissed a fortiorari

15

because of plaintiff's lack of contacts, and I submit

16

that on remand we would, and I represent this

17

responsibly, be able to demonstrate that Flynt had those

18

contacts himself, as did the corporation, which would

19

satisfy the International Shoe formula as to them.

never

The references made by counsel to the

20

21

restatement were to the restatement of conflict, and I

22

think that what is spoken of in that restatement

23

primarily has to do with choice of law, not with

24

jurisdiction or definition as to what constitutes a

25

tort.

There was a considerable reference to the

the case could be tried, but it ought to be mentioned

7

that under the Van Dusen case, the corpus juris that

would be applied so far as the statute of limitations is

9

concerned is the corpus juris of the forum in which the

10

action was brought, namely, New Hampshire.
Essentially, what this Court has heard this

11
12

morning is a claim which the respondents argue that

13

other states* statutes of limitations prohibit New

Hampshire from exercising a jurisdiction which for

15

itself it has determined at six years.

conclude, Mr. Chief Justice and members of this Court,

the airports in which you land, we are so homogeneous it

is almost impossible to know where you are, but I think
