Mr. Schafer, I think

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. SCHAFER, III

CN BEHALF CF THE PETITIONEE

5

MR. SCHAFER:

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7

please the Court, this case questions the propriety

8

under the double jeopardy clause of the Arizona Supreme

9

Court ordering a resentencing, following a life sentence

10

that was imposed after the sentencer erroneously

11

concluded as a matter of law that one of the statutory

12

aggravating factors was not applicable to this case.
New, the facts are rather simple.

13
14

Dennis Rumsey decided to rob the motorist who picked him

15

up.

16

convicted of both murder and robbery.

17

hearing to determine the sentence for murder, the State

18

offered no new evidence to the sentencer,

21

the trial.

To accomplish that, he shot him.

Rumsey was

The State simply

One of the aggravating factors,

the State felt

23

had been shewn by the evidence that was introduced at

24

the trial, was that the killing had been done for

25

pecuniary gain.

Now, without deciding whether that had

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

been shown or not, the trial judge said that that

2

aggravating factor — pecuniary gain -- applied to only

3

a very narrow class of killers, hired killers, and it

4

had no application to a robbery murder such as occurred

5

here.
The State at the initial hearing also argued

6

7

two other aggravating factors, claimed that they had

8

beer shewn by the evidence, tut the trial judge

9

disagreed.

In the special verdict where the trial judge

10

is required by statute to list his findings on each of

11

the aggravating factors under the statute, the judge

12

found that there were none present, and he imposed a

13

life sentence which the statute requires where no

14

aggravation has been shown.

15

imposed a consecutive sentence for the robbery.

16

The judge at that time also

Now, both sides appealed to the Arizona

17

Supreme Court; Hr. Rumsey from the consecutive sentences

18

that had been imposed, and

19

legal ruling that the pecuniary gain circumstance

20

applied only to hired killers.

21

QUESTION:

the State from the judge’s

Hr. Schafer, may I ask right there,

22

would the State have had the right to appeal if the

23

defendant had net appealed?

24

HR. SCHAFER:

We would not have under the

appeal statute. Your Honor.

QUESTION;

There is seme ether statutory

14

method of review in Arizona by which the prosecution can

15

get a review of the sentences?

16

MR. SCHAFER;

There is an action, which is

17

called in the rules "Special Action," which permits the

18

State or the defense, either part, to gain a hurry-up

19

decision frem the Supreme Ccurt where it is claimed and

20

is shown that there has been abusive discretion.

21

22

opportunity arisen.

QUESTION*

13
14

Mr. Schafer, could the State and

the defense offered evidence that there be sentencing?

15

MR. SCHAEER*

Yes, Your Honor, we could have.

16

And with that finding, the judge then set the

17

sentence at death.

Rumsey’s appeal was then automatic

18

to the Arizona Supreme Court, and the Arizona Supreme

19

Court reversed itself cn the basis of Eullingtcn v.

20

Missouri .
The State sought certiorari because of its

21

22

belief that Eullington is not implicated in this case,

23

because there has been no acquittal in the trial court.

24

And I believe that's the question that this Court must

25

decide:

Was there a resolution of the factual issue

against the State?

tie contend the record shows that

2

there was not, that there was no rejection of our

3

position that the murder was for monetary or pecuniary

4

gain.
The reason for the holding in Bullington was

5
6

that the State of Missouri had a full and a fair

7

opportunity to muster its forces and to present its case

8

to the sentencer.

9

rejected the case of the State.

And in that case, the sentencer

acquittal.

given another opportunity#to present its case when it

had failed to make its case the first time.

There was no such acquittal here.

Because the double jeopardy clause gives

to that murder was that he was net going to reach the

19

factual issue, because it simply didn't apply in the

20

case.

The only thing he decided in regard

QUESTION:

23
24
25

This means, I suppose, Mr. Schafer,

that further proceedings are necessary then?
MB. SCHAFER;

I do not believe further

proceedings are necessary at this point, Ycur Honor.

The relief we would ask for is that you overturn the

2

Arizona Supreme Court opinion and allow them to go

3

forward' with the appeal.
The appeal from the death sentence has never

4
5

been held.
QUESTION*

6

In your brief, on page 19, you say

7

that the tria court found that Rumsey committed the

8

crime for pecuniary gain.
MR. SCHAFERs

QUESTION*

10

You do not cite to the record on

Now, specifically, what I*m referring to in

18

in the brief — is that in regard to the robbery, the

were before the trial judge, I believe the conclusion is

The same force was used

And if you read what the trial

inescapable that in his mind he had concluded that the

2

murder was for pecuniary gain, that the case of the

3

murder was the robbery, which cur Supreme Court .has

4

defined under the murder statute as the definition cf

5

pecuniary gain.
Now, a little earlier when I spoke, I -- I

6

7

believe made the statement that the trial judge did not

8

make a factual determination in regard to the murder.

9

tried

to be clear in the brief to show that his

10

conclusion was really stated when he was sentencing for

11

the robbery and not for the murder.

12

I

Ny point is that I believe the entire record

13

shews that there was nc question in his mind that he

14

believed, if he could have considered that circumstance,

15

that the murder was for pecuniary gain.

16

QUESTION*

Hr. Schafer, what do you — hew do

17

ycu distinguish the language of this Court in United

18

States v. Scott when it said that the fact that the

19

acquittal in a criminal case may result from an

20

erroneous evidentiary ruling or erroneous interpretation

21

of governing legal principals affects the accuracy of

22

the determination, but it doesn't alter its character?

23

In other words, even though an acquittal might

24

be based on an erroneous interpretation of law, it's

25

binding for double jeopardy purposes.

Now, to the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

extent that the death sentencing curing is given similar

2

characteristics, how dc you distinguish that?
ME. SCHAFER;

3

I distinguish it like this, Your

4

Honor.

5

Scott and other cases from this Court, there was an

6

actual acquittal.

7

terminated the proceedings against the State, as this

8

Court said last week in Lydon.

9

show there but termination.

10

I believe that there was no acquittal here.

In

There was nothing in this case that

There was nothing to

The only thing that could approach being an

11

acquittal here was the trial judge’s statement that "I

12

am not even going tc consider this," although I am

13

paraphrasing, of course.

14

finished with the sentencing, as he is required to do by

15

statute, without even getting to that aggravating factor.

And he went ahead, then, and

16

My point is that —

17

QUESTION;

Well, the problem, of course, is

18

that Bullington has treated the sentencing hearing as

19

much like a trial for purposes of acquittal.

20

MR. SCHAFER;

21

QUESTION;

22
23

Yes, that is true.

Sc that's why, when you combine

Bullington with Scott, you have a problem, don’t you?
MR. SCHAFER;

I think I have a problem, tut i

24

think the answer to that is. Your Honor, that even with

25

Bullington and all of the language in Bullington, ve can

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

argue, reasonably so, that there was nc acquittal.

2

Bullingtcn dees require an acquittal.

3

acquittal in Bullington of death, of course, but we have

4

nc such acquittal here.

the case against the State, and I think that*s the

6

distin ction.

7

QUESTIONi

There was ar

He have no such termination of

Mr. Schafer, doesn’t that argument

8

depend on your being right about the special action

9

being a method of reveiw?

Because if ycu could not have

10

appealed independently, could it not be said that the

11

case on sentencing was ever against the State?

12
13
14
15

MR. SCHAFERi

If we had no method of appeal.

Your Hcncr, I think I would have to —
QUESTIONi

Wouldn't that have been equivalent

tc an acquittal?

16

MR. SCHAFERi

17

QUESTIONi

At the State — well, I would --

Sc that doesn't the case under your

18

approach really require us to decide whether you did

19

have this method of review otherwise?

20

MR. SCHAFERi

I would not like tc concede

21

that, but logically, Ycur Hcncr, I believe I'd have to

22

say that there would be a termination in our favor

23

because we could gc nowhere from that.

QUFSTIOSi

The facts of its case had already been presented

What Arizona asked for in its

appeal was to correct the error that had been made, and

11

in that sense it was much like the appeal the government

12

took in the DiFrancescc case.

correct an error by the sentencer, and that appeal was

14

upon the record that was made in the sentencing court.

That’s the same thing that was done here by the State of

That appeal was to

If the controlling consideration behind the

18

double jeopardy clause where there is an acguittal, is

19

to prevent the government oppression that would come

20

with repeated efforts to convict and to make up its

21

deficiencies in the State's case with each new effort of

22

reprosecution, then applying the double jeopardy clause

23

here would net accomplish that.

that the first jeopardy was terminated.
But it was not terminated here.

2

And I

3

believe, absent that, Bullingtcn really does not apply

to this fact situation.

16

It was felt that there was no need to overrule Stroud,

17

that what distinguished the two cases were the number of

18

trial protections given in Eullington that were not

19

present in Stroud.

And we have the Pearce,

And Stroud involved a death sentence after
Eullington did not overrule Stroud.

The effect of that recognition is that the

20
21

more trial attributes a state builds into its sentencing

22

procedure, the more likely it is to lose the ability to

23

eliminate aberrant sentences like that given to Dennis

24

Rumsey .

25

Since

1972 and the Furman case, we, the states

10

to take it away from the holding in Bullingtcn, and

11

perhaps return it to a case like DiFrancesco or Stroud.

12

And that would not be the signal that should be sent to

13

such a state.
Our argument is that Bullingtcn dees not apply

14
15

because there has been no final termination factually

against the State’s point.

In fact,

1

these differences that do exist either are insignificant

2

to the double jeopardy issue or they make Arizona's

3

procedure even more like a trial than is Missouri's.
First of all, the fact that a judge is a fact

jury trials.

Third, the fact that the rules of evidence do

not apply to mitigation in Arizona is net significant.

13

What is significant is that the rules of evidence apply

14

to aggravating circumstances, those things which must be

proven in order to result in the imposition of the death

This implies that the risk of error at that

22

that this is not the case in Arizona,

like a trial.

The fact

crime beyond a reasonable doubt, does not have to prove

separately that they are sufficient for a conviction.

Once they are proven, that results in conviction.
Finally, the fact that Arizona's procedure

5
6

dees net allow the Court tc exercise compassion and

7

sentence a defendant to life, even though the State has

8

proven its case, makes the Arizona procedure more like a

9

trial than Missouri's.

Never at a trial on guilt or

10

innocence is the jury ever instructed that even though

11

they find the State has proven their case beyond a

12

reasonable doubt, that they can still acquit the

The petitioner also attempts to fit the
