CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Deatherage, I think

you may proceed whenever you're ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. DEATHERAGE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DEATHERAGE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and rray it

please the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit.

The battle lines

were drawn in this case on the issue of whether or net
the Education of All Handicapped Children Act requires
public schools to provide and perform medical treatment,
prescribed by a private physician and delegated to the
school as a related service in order for the child tc
benefit from education, special education,

and to

receive a free, appropriate public education.
Initially, the plaintiffs, the respondents
here, filed an application for preliminary injunction
seeking an order from the district court ordering the
district, the Irving Independent School District, tc
provide a medical procedure subsequently stipulated and
found tc be medical treatment tc the respondent, Amber
Tatro.
The school district denied the application —
I'm sorry -- the district court denied the preliminary
3

1

application for injunction relief and held

2

medical treatment requested did not arise from the

3

effort to educate, and that Section 504 of the 1973

4

Rehabilitation Act could not be converted into a statute

5

requiring the setting up of governmental health care.

6

QUESTIONS

that the

Nr. Deatherage, I guess there's

7

some question, is there not, whether there is indeed

8

medical treatment?

9

NR. DEATHERAGE:

Justice C'Ccnnor, the record

10

reflects there is no question at all.

Ultimately, the

11

plaintiffs stipulated — or the respondents stipulated

12

in. the pretrial order bound in the joint opinion that

13

clean intermittent catherization, the procedure in

14

question, was medical treatment.

15

George Hurt, who was one of the co-authors of the

16

document ultimately adopted by the American Nedical

17

Association — testified it was the medical treatment of

18

choice of a disease state suffered by Amber; that is, an

19

urgent bladder.

Their position -- Dr.

20

So there's never been a question or a dispute,

21.

at least since the administrative hearing, as to whether
\

22
23

or not the procedure is medical treatment.
QUESTION;

If — if a child had tc have seme

24

medication administered routinely during the school day

25

in order to remain in school would it be your position
4

1

that it constitutes medical treatment for someone at the

2

school to administer the medication?

3

MR. DEATHERAGE:

Under Texas law, Justice

4

0'Conner, I don't believe that is construed as medical

5

treatment by the school employee who gives the

6

medication.

7

prescribes it so that the parent or the child can gc to

8

the pharmacy and obtain the medication.

9

It is medical treatment when the doctor

QUESTIONS

Well, isn’t this the same kind cf a

10

thing?

11

be administered by a physician?

12

The doctor prescribes it, but it doesn't have to

MR. DEATHERAGE:

Whether or not it has to be

13

administered personally by the physician does not take

14

it out of the realm of medical treatment as defined

15

under the Texas Medical Practice Act.

16

amended since trial cf this case, the physician — and

17

at the time of trial -- the physician may, in accordance

18

with the act and the Board of Medical Examiners rule,

19

prescribe certain medical tasks and delegate them to

20

another party, a third party other than the patient, for

21

performance, such as a scrub nurse in surgery, so long

22

as that physician retains supervision and control cf the

23

delegatee and the act to be performed; but it is still

24

medical treatment.

25

QUESTION;

Under that act as

Well, then, is giving medication

1

medical treatment, in your view and in Texas law?
MR. DEATHERAGE:

2

Prescribing it by the

3

physician is.

4

construe it as being medical treatment, if the

5

school teacher gives what the parent had brought, the

6

pill,

7

attached as an appendix to cur reply brief that

8

specifically authorizes the public school employee under

9

certain conditions, if the parent sends the medication

There is a specific statute — even if we

in a container -- there is a Texas statute

10

in its original container, that allows the schoolteacher

11

to give that child that pill and be immune from civil

12

liability for damages if something adverse happens.

13
14

♦There is no similar statute in Texas that is applicable
to this type of procedure involved in this case.
The district court initially, as I related

15
16

earlier, held that the requested medical treatment did

17

not arise from the effort to educate and that it could

18

not be converted into a statute requiring the setting up

19

of governmental health care under Section 504.
The Fifth Circuit panel initially in Tatro I

20
21

held that the district court was wrong on both counts

22

and vacated and remanded for further proceedings

23

consistent with what we believe -- we believe to be an

24

advisory opinion, since the court acknowledged initially

25

it had

no facts before it.
6

1

Cn remand, the district court, feeling

2

constrained by Tatro I, found that the petitioner, the

3

school district, could not lawfully provide the medical

4

treatment under Texas law without additional services of

5

a licensed physician; that under —

QUESTION:

Mr. Deatherage, let me interrupt.

The little girl Amber is a good bit older now, isn't she?

8

MR. DEATHERAGE:

9

QUESTION;

Yes, Justice Blackmun.

Do you know — maybe I should ask

10

your opposing counsel — is she able herself to

11

administer CIC at this point?

12

MR. DEATHERAGE;

I have no personal knowledge

13

of that, Justice Blackmun.

14

one of

15

goals for Amber through occupational therapy and other

16

specialized instruction to — where she can ultimately

17

do that.

18

tc take care of herself, I have no personal knowledge.

I know it was

the -- it has been and always has been one of the

Whether or not Friday at school she was able

QUESTION;

19

She may be.

Let me get back tc Justice

20

O'Connor's question, because it was going tc be mine if

21

she hadn't asked it, and I’m not sure of your answer.
Suppose this were a prescription drug, and it

22
23

was just a question of the — someone in the school

24

digging it out every four hours and handing it to

25

Amber.

You would say this was not medical treatment.
7

MR. DEATHERAGE;

1

Under Texas law, Justice

2

Blackmun, I don't think so.

I don't believe sc.

There

is a distinction.

4

for medication, he writes the prescription directed to

5

the pharmacist to fill this prescription.

6

direct that prescription to the public school employee

7

and does not delegate to the public school employee the

8

administering of that pill.

9

the prescription is written to the pharmacy.

When the doctor writes a prescription

He does net

That's dedicated to the —

The parent may choose to bring the medicine in

10
11

its original container, under the state statute, and in

12

writing authorize the school employee to give out cf

13

that original container that medication in accordance

14

with the label on -- on the container.

15

instance, you see, the employee of the school is making

16

no judgments, forming no judgments, is not exercising

17

any medical judgment in merely removing the capsule and

18

giving it to the student with the consent of the parent,

19

because the prescription is not directed to the school

20

employee.
QUESTION*

21

But in that

May I ask a followup on that

22

question?

Your reply brief has the statute about the

23

immunity from liability if they fellow that procedure.

24

Is it your suggestion that until that statute was

25

passed, it would have teen a violation of law for that
8

1

procedure to have teen followed?

2

MR. DEATHERAGE;

The public school employee at

3

that time was subjected individually to claims for

4

damages —

5

QUESTION;

I understand.

Had no immunity from

6

liability.

7

all the employee did, they didn't follow -- there’s no

8

statute to protect them -- tut could not the employee

9

have performed the procedure without doing anything

10

unlawful?

11
12

That was -- yes.

They've

done it for years.
QUESTION;

But there’s no immunity issue in

this case, is there?
MR. DEATHERAGE;

15
16

Just without immunity is all.
MR. DEATHERAGE:

13
14

But assume that there was no negligence, and

No, Justice Stevens, there's

not.

17

Under the Texas Medical Practice Act, the

18

district court found a physician may prescribe medical

19

treatment and delegate its performance to a nonlicensed

20

person or institution that he deems qualified subject to

21

control, supervision and adequate monitoring by the

22

physician* that the physician may prescribe the medical

23

treatment to be furnished by the public school if he

24

believes the school has personnel qualified to perform

25

it.

The school employee was found

sufficient training, the court found, the school's

nurses are capable of performing the medical treatment,

and that when the medical treatment is performed by such

6

nurses in accordance with a valid doctor's prescription,

7

it would not constitute the unlawful practice of

medicine.

Until that occurs, the court had found,

opinions, that if the school had provided

12

catheterization without a doctor's prescription valid

13

under Texas law, it would have unlawfully been

practicing medicine.
Also, the court found that if these conditions

15
16

are met, the medical treatment then becomes services

17

provided by a qualified school nurse or other qualified

18

person, which is the definition of school health

19

services under the regulations implementing the

20

Education of All Handicapped Children Act.

21

Therefore, these are school health services

and are therefore related services because also under

school health services, and that's not mentioned in the

The Fifth Circuit —

you're correct and the school does not have to provide

MR. DEATHERAGE*

The state and the Irving

Independent School District must provide Amber Tatrc

defined in the statute, as interpreted by this Court in

QUESTION;

Is that likely to cost more than tc

service — that is, services of a qualified — of a

school nurse or a qualified person — or medical service.

16

Finding that it fits under either

17

classification doesn’t answer the question.

18

question is did Congress intend that the nature and

Deatherage, at what is a medical service to federal law
13

1

for defining that fcr purposes cf this Act without

2

regard

to how Texas law might treat it?
HR. DEATHERAGEs

3

If I understand your

4

question, Justice O’Connor, at least -- yes, I think --

5

I think you must -- I think this Court is going to have

6

to look, and all the courts in this area,

7

to state law in determining perhaps what is medical

8

treatm ent.
QUESTION;

9

to some degree

Well, that’s my question.

Would we

10

have to decide what is a medical service with reference

11

only to federal law, or do we have to look to state law

12

to determine that?
MR. DEATHERAGE;

13

I submit that is answered by

14

looking to the state plan that is agreed to by the state

15

and the Secretary under the Act, that’s called fcr fcr

16

the Act, in order for the state to get those — to get

17

the federal funds; that the content of a state plan will

18

address what the state provides as medical services,

19

schcol health services, which is then agreed to by the

20

Secretary.

QUESTION:

The district court, I notice on

indicated that in footnote 12 that it agreed with you;

6

that the statute tolerated state-to-state variance.

Yes, Justice Eehnquist.

8

That's included in the cites of part of the implementing

regula ticns.

10

QUESTION:

Do you think the statute also

11

admits school district to school district variations,

12

depending upon the personnel that are available?

13

ME. DEATHEEAGE;

Justice O'Connor, I don't see

14

how that could apply, because the state is the one that

15

enters into the contract with the federal government,

16

and a part of that state contract is they require the

17

local school district to -- applying for funds to adhere

18

to the provisions of a state plan.

19

believe — I can't envision a situation or a set of

20

circumstanees in which one school district is not

21

required to provide certain services and another school

22

district is within the same state.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAKES C. TOED, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. TODD

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The true issue of this case before the Ccurt

8
9

i

is one of access to public education; more specifically,

10

whether an eight-year cld girl of normal intelligence

11

who is capable of doing schcolwork in regular public

12

elementary school will be able to attend class in a

13

regular public elementary school alongside her

14

non bandicapped age group peers.

*

If she is to receive a free public education

15
16

in the public schools, it's been found as a fact that

17

she must be provided the safe, simple, quick, effective

18

and inexpensive service of clean intermittent

19

cathet erization.

20

As was brought out this morning in questioning

21

by Justices O’Conner and Blackmun, the service of clean

22

intermittent catheterization is closely analogous tc the

23

dispensing of medication by school personnel during the

24

school day to permit a handicapped child to attend

25

school.

And that service, even the petitioners concede.
17

is not medical treatment within the meaning of the Act.

1

Fcr example, an orthcpedically handicapped

2
3

child who suffers arthritic pain may have his physician

4

prescribe for him aspirin at regular intervals during

5

the school day.

6

medication, the pain that is a symptom of his handicap

7

may prevent him frcm participating in a public

8

education.

9

child has access tc a free public education.

Without the provision cf that

With the provision of the medication, the

A similar analogy would be the child disabled

by the handicap of epilepsy whose physician prescribes

12

anti-seizure medication during the schccl day.

QUESTION:

What if you had a pupil who had a

14

lower tack disk problem or a cervical disk problem and

15

had to be in traction periodically?

16

tracticn would be required as a related -MR. TODD:

17

Would you think

Probably not, Your Honor, in that

18

the traction would actually remove the child frcm the

19

public educational setting, so that this would net be a

20

servie e.
QUESTION:

21
22

Ycu cculd have some kinds of

traction right in the classroom.
MR. TODD:

23

Right.

Well, the — to the extent

24

that medical equipment — equipment is involved, the

25

school

district would not be required tc provide the
18

1

equipment, just as it is not required to provide the

2

catheter in this case, and just as it is not required to

3

provide, for example, a hearing aid.

4

school district would have to make some accommodations

5

so that a -- a child who is in traction, and if there

6

are not other reasons to remove him, would be able to

7

attend and participate.

However, the

8

I think that the — what makes the

9

catheterization so analogous to the type of service we

10

talked about this morning is that although it is

11

prescribed by a physician, it is actually delivered

12

quite easily by nonmedical school personnel.

13

although it can be said to treat a health-related

14

symptom of the handicapped, it is a service that's

15

needed to enable the child to have access to the public

16

educat ion.

17

QUESTIONs

Well,

And

I didn't understand from your

18

colleague on the other side that under Texas law that a

19

nonmedical person would be allowed to administer -- to

20

perform the CIC.

21
22
23
24
25

HR. TODD:

Oh, under Texas law it's quite

permissible, and as a matter of fact -QUESTION:

I don't mean a doctor.

I mean how

about a nurse?
HR. TODD:

Well, or even someone other than a
19

nurse such as the aide.
QUESTION i

2

Well, my question really is will

They

10

I know.

What if it were — what if

11

they -- what if under the law or in their judgment, in

12

order to carry out this procedure they would have to

13

hire an additional person that they wouldn't ordinarily

14

do?
MR. TODD.

16

That would still not offend the

Act, Your Honor, in that if you’ll notice -QUESTION

Well, would the Act require them to

Yes.

QUESTION

Even though it wouldn't require

17

21
22

do that?
And, for example --

their, tc tuy a piece of equipment like a catheter.
MR. TODD;

Right.

And the example I wanted to

23

give you, the Act specifically requires physical

24

therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathologists and

25

audiologists, and then it states that state standards
20

1

must d etermine the qualifications of these individuals.

2

A licensed physical therapist is the person

who mu st provide physical therapy.

QUESTION;

Mr. Todd, did you stipulate that

it's a medical service?
MR. TODD;

It was stipulated that it can be

11

called a medical treatment, and if I cculd, I would like

12

to address that.

13

One of the things that's led to so much

14

misunderstanding is the assumption that the word

15

"medical" has a fixed meaning from one context to

16

another, and I'd like to give you an example.

17

In the Education of the Handicapped Act,

18

medical service is defined not to include physical

19

therapy, occupational therapy,

20

audiology, psychologic services.

21

speech pathology,

Now, in another act of Congress, the Medicaid

22

statute, 42 U.S. Code 1396 and the sections following,

23

these very same services, by name, are defined as

24

medical services.

And it was the task of the Department cf

And I think what the Department did was to

balance two policies that are clear in the Act.

the policy of nonexclusion, or as this Court pointed out

7

in the Board of Education v. Rowley case, the inclusion

8

into public school of previously excluded handicapped

9

children.

One is

10

On the other hand, balanced against that was

11

that strictly medical services are not included in the

12

array of related services.

13

line was to define medical services as the services of a

14

licensed physician.

15

from the most expensive type of medical services they

16

might be called upon to provide and —

17

And the way they drew the

But you stipulated that it was such

19
20

well,

I didn't do the stipulation, but it was stipulated

21

that it's medical in the sense that a physician

22

prescribes it for medical reasons, but that -- just as a

23

physician might prescribe physical therapy, for example,

24

for a medical treatment purpose, for example, the

25

prevention cf the atrophy of muscle tissue.
27

But that

1

would not exclude it as a service that is also needed

during school hours to enable the child to be educated.

3

We're not asking here that a school district

catheterization that Amber happens to receive during the

6

school day would not by itself be enough to accomplish

7

the complete medical purpose, because she still needs it

20

Community College v. Davis case concerning Section 504

21

that the accommodations — that a state cannot be

MB. TODD

The Department of Education

2

considered -- considered excluding clean intermittent

3

catheterization, or at least they took up the question

4

of whether or not it should be, because it was receiving

5

a lot of discussion.
There's a passage from the most recent

6
7

Department of Education commentary on this point that's

8

quoted in part, in part by the petitioner's reply

brief.

The very next sentence of that passage, which is

10

not included in the petitioner's reply brief, states

11

that "Clean intermittent catheterization will continue

12

to be a service for which a state can be reimbursed

13

•

under the Education of the Handicapped Act."
So the Department of Education has not made

14
15

any definitive ruling to exclude it.

Sc.

I agree.

31

MR. TODD

1

They gave an illustrative list

2

And if the -- if I can, I think there are three ways

3

that I can discuss in which this service is needed tc

4

assist

Amber to benefit from special education.
Congress clearly envisioned a number of types

5
6

of educational benefit.

One, of course, is the benefit

7

of an academic instruction in the classroom; and we’ve

8

discussed how this is needed in order to get Amber to

9

the classroom and allow her to remain there, just as

10

physical therapy might work with a child’s mobility so

11

that a child can mcve from room to room or so that a

12

child can get into a desk and get out of it.

13

But there’s another important educational

14

benefit to which Congress attached at least as much

15

importance, and that’s the benefit derived from just

16

being in that classroom with ncnhandicapped children,

17

with sharing the normal educational experience in public

18

schools that shapes most people and prepares them fcr

19

independent life in the community.
That’s a key benefit, and so much stress is

20
21

laid on it in both the legislative history and the key

22

words of the Act that it's clear that — in fact, it

23

even gees sc far as to say that a child is net tc be

24

denied

25

even with the use of supplementary aids and services.

that benefit unless it just can’t be provided,

32

1

So tha t the only children who should be removed from

2

this n ormal educational experience are those whose

3

specia 1 instructional needs are so complex and so

4

specia 1 that they can only be provided in an environment

5

that’s

separate .

6

But here there’s nc question tut that the type

of ins truction that Amber can benefit from, not to

history by both the principal cc-author of Section 504,

Senator Humphrey, and one of the major co-authors cf the

8

Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Senator

9

Stafford .

10

let me recall a very

They gave the example of a building that's

11

architecturally inaccessible, and said — each of them

12

said it's still discrimination not to do something, even

13

if — whether it's a ramp or whether it's adult

14

assistance tc go and get the child and bring the child

15

up; that for a school district — a school district is

16

still violating both acts by failing tc extend that

17

additional service needed tc overcome this obstacle.

18

Now, in Amber's case, the obstacle is

19

different, but it's an obstacle posed by the handicap;

20

that is, to get through a school day she needs adult

21

assistance with her toileting function.

22

that adult assistance, which involves a very small

23

amount of time and trouble, then she can share with

24

other children the public school experience that

25

Congress wanted to make available to the maximum extent

If she doesn't

And the cost — it was brought out in

4

questioning this morning, I believe by Justice O'Connor,

5

as to the disparity in cost between excluding her and

6

segregating her from the regular public school system.

7

I'd like to say that the cost is not only in

8

terms of the extra amount of dollars which the taxpayers

9

have to pay to support her in this expensive private

10

school? there's a cost in frustrating the intent of

11

Congress.

12

whatever additional burdens are required to admit

13

handicapped children and integrate them into the normal

14

public school experience is more than offset by the

15

savings in that by being part of this normal experience,

16

which is social as well as instructional, they are

17

better prepared to be independent in later life,

18

means that for the rest of their lives they don't have

19

to be paid, for example, supplemental security income,

20

or they don't have to be paid as much; they don't have

21

to be institutionalized; they don't have to have as many

22

adults or as many publicly paid caretakers to assist

23

them.

24
25

Congress made the judgment that the --

And this also is — it's a policy judgment

35

Looking at that

1

policy and trying to judge the facts of this case in

2

terms of it, it's clear that -- I think, that the

3

balance should be struck in favor of Amber to provide

this service, allow her to participate, and that this

falls well within the meaning of the Act, especially as

QUESTION;

Didn’t our Davis case pretty much

3

say there was — there was no affirmative action

5

HR. TODD i

Your Honor, the Davis case did

6

address the question of affirmative action, but in that

7

case you had a college student seeking to have the

8

standards of admission altered so that she could qualify

9

for a program that she didn*t qualify for.

10

Here, you have the -- the public secondary and

11

elementary context, and we’re not asking for the

12

lowering of standards.

13

secondary level, has already made the judgment, and

14

state laws have already made the judgment that it's a

15

free public — that everyone should have access to it.

16

So it’s not a question of lowering standards in order tc

17

enable people who were not otherwise qualified to become

18

qualified, as has been sometimes the issue in seme cf

19

the affirmative action cases dealt with by this Court --

20

QUESTION;

Congress, at the elementary and

I think Davis gees a little further

21

than that, indicating that it’s a question of not

22

discriminating rather than providing special services.

23

HR. TODD;

Right.

24

QUESTION;

And I think the argument -- I thin k

25

that your argument is much stronger under the first act
37

1

than i t is under this act.

2

HR. TODDi

Well, if -- if -- the Davis case

3

went o n to say that technological advances can bring

4

about services which can accommodate the needs of the

5

h andie apped at no undue burden.

6

is a v ery good illustration of just such a service.

7

And T think this case

Its predecessor, sterile catheterization, was

8

burden seme and somewhat expensive.

The technology has

9

predue ed a service which is very easy, which even a

10

ten-ye ar old child can do, and which makes all the

11

differ ence in the world to the — to the child's

12

accept ance and admission.
And the legislative history covered not only

13
14

the ki nd of overt discrimination when you put up a sign

15

that s ay no handicapped need apply, but it also covered

16

this e xample of failure to remove barriers that prevent

17

an oth erwise qualified handicapped person from admission.

18

However, as to whether — as to which basis

19

relief is grounded on, obviously our primary concern is

20

tha t A mber receive the service and that she be enabled

to par ticipate in public school and receive this

Well, it cculd.

If you ruled that

the Education of the Handicapped Act preempts 504, then

that would settle that.

MR. TODD;

Okay.

Thank you. Your Honor.

I think that I can just summarize by going

back to the original point.

This is really an access

a child who’s capable of doing schoolwork in the public

schools, who’s entitled by law, will be given the simple

and safe and inexpensive service that will permit her

This is a case that poses the question of whether

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAKES W. DEATHERAGE, ESQ.,

25

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
40

1

2
3

MR. DEATHERAGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Let me answer one issue or, as counsel says,

4

the only issue, and that is access.

5

Court's opinion in Rowley and if I read the intent and

6

purpose cf the Education of the Handicapped Act, it is

7

-- I don't find any — anything -- any authority to say

8

that it's tc guarantee access to any particular,

9

specific class, program or activity.

If I read this

Eut as I believe

10

this Court said in Rowley, it is access to special

11

education and to an appropriate public education.

12

The underlying theory or philosophy of the

13

Education of the Handicapped Act, in addition to its

14

purpose of providing for early identification, proper

15

evaluation and appropriate placement, is the

16

individualization of an education plan for a child.

17

as Rowley again said, I believe in footnote 4 of that

18

opinion, Congress recognized that not all children are

19

going to be able to be safely educated in what is

20

referred to as the least restrictive environment.

21

recognizes the health and safety conditions of a child.

22

And

It

So to characterize the issue in this case as

23

access to a particular classroom is to disregard a

24

record made in this case since June of 1979 which has

25

been always, until counsel's brief, whether cr net
41

1

medical treatment required to be prescribed by a private

2

physician is mandated by Congress to be provided as a

3

related service by the public schools.

4

issue.

5

QUESTION*

That is the

Well, I suppose — I suppose,

6

Counsel, that physical therapy can often be by -- on

7

prescription of a physician and nonetheless required to

8

be provided by the public school under the Education for

9

the Handicapped Act.

10

HE. DEATHEEAGEs

Yes, Justice O’Conner, it may

11

be, depending on the doctor’s purpose in the

12

prescription and tc the degree whether it's related to

13

benefitting from special education.

14

prescribe a particular physical therapy may or may net

15

in a given case fall within the requirements of the

16

Education of the Handicapped Act.

Eut to merely

17

Further, the recitation of physical therapy in

18

the statute doesn't have the limiting language volume as

19

medical services dees, which says except for diagnosis

20

and evaluation only.

21

As to what ether courts deal with the extent

22

or parameters cf physical therapy, I would not represent

23

to this Court today.

24

on the face of the statute exceptions, and there are in

25

the st ate plan.

But certainly, there would appear

42

1

Another issue or a matter to keep

that's

2

involved in this case is remembering what qualified

3

Amber for special education under the Act in the first

4

place.

5

entitled her to special education.

6

treatment prescribed by the doctor in this case is for

7

treatment of a condition completely unrelated to what

8

qualifies her for special education.

9

been a dispute in that in this case, and in fact, that

That was an orthopedic impairment.

That is what

The medical

And there's never

10

has been stipulated to as to the orthopedic impairment,

11

and that the neurogenic bladder to which this case is

12

designed is not related to that.

13

Under the court's reasoning below, whatever --

14

QUESTION :

Is it your position that a child

15

with the spina bifida condition cannot qualify as a

16

handicapped child under the Act?

17

HR. DEATHERAGE;

18

saying it cannot qualify.

19

case indicates that only the orthopedic impairment with

20

some speech impairment is what qualified.

21

case it very well could, in a more severe case.
QUESTION;

22
23

impairment was?

24

it?

25

No, Justice O'Connor,

I'm not

I only say the record in this

In another

May I ask what the orthopedic

There seems to be a great mystery about

MR. DEATHERAGE;

Developmental delays in gross

43

1

and fine motor skills, which is why the physical therapy

2

was designed for the improvement cf gross motor skills,

3

so the child can benefit from special education, can

4

participate in physical activities, i.e., physical

5

education classes offered by the school district;

6

occupational therapy designed to develop and improve

7

fine motor skills in which Amber was developmentally

8

delayed, so she can grasp a pencil to write, so some day

9

she can learn to grasp a catheter and take care of her

10

own self.
QUESTION*

11

Well, we've had comments all

12

through the argument about an orthopedic impairment, and

13

no one ever said what it was.

14

we’re talking basically about a urological problem, and

15

urology and orthopedics are somewhat different.
NR. DEATHERAGEi

16

Eecause it seemed to me

Correct, Justice Blackmun.

17

And my

18

qualifies her for special education, but is what the

19

respondent seeks the medical treatment for.

20

point is that the urology problem is not what

QUESTIONS

Well, to the extent this case turns

21

on whether -- whether under state law administering CIC

22

is a medical service, aren’t we -- aren’t we entitled to

23

rely on the court of appeals for that?

24
25

KR. DEATHERAGEi
it this way.

Justice White, let me answer

As I said in my opening argument, the
44

1

history cf this case has been a battle as between

2

whether this is a medical service or whether it is a

3

school health service.

4

We submit to the Court that the question is

5

whether or not this medical treatment is required.

6

net who may be qualified to perform it under either the

7

federal act or the state act.

8

purpose of the treatment.

9

QUESTIONj

Well,

It's

It is the nature and

so let’s suppose that it was

10

-- that you just agreed that this was not a medical

11

service within the -- within the meaning cf -- of the —

12

of the Act.

13

concede that this is a — another supportive service?
ME. DEATHERAGEi

14
15

It was not medical service.

Then would you

If the fact situation in

another case were different, Justice White —

16

QUESTIONS

Well, no.

17

MR. DEATHERAGEj

For this case.

In this case I cannot concede

18

that,

because the district court found that the school

19

could

net lawfully provide this treatment without a

20

doctor *s prescription.

21

QUESTIONS

Well,

I knew, but the court -- that

22

may be true, but the court of appeals nevertheless said

23

it was not a medical service within the meaning cf the

24

Education for the Handicapped Act, didn’t it?

25

nothing in state law made it so.
45

And that

It had to hold that.

1

HE. DEATHERAGE

The court of appeals had no

2

facts and did not have the facts that this Court has

3

before it now.

4

Justice Goldberg in the Tatro I opinion in his

5

three-prcnged test in dealing whether a life support

6

system is a related service, said that excluded from the

7

term "related services" are these health-related

8

activities which must be performed by a licensed

9

physician that are not provided to determine a child's

10

medically related handicapping condition which results

11

in the child's need for special education.

It had no record.

But in that regard,

By looking at Texas Hedical Association brief

12

13

requested by the trial court, made a part of its

14

memorandum opinion, page 25 and 6 of our brief are

15

listed

16

are required in this case in order for the school

17

district to provide what is prescribed.

18

listed

19

numerous services of a licensed physician that

And we have

some seven or eight Texas Hedical Association -So by — under the Fifth Circuit’s own

20

reasoning and its exclusion, in this case this medical

21

record falls within that exclusion, because it requires

22

the services of a licensed physician.

23

Under the reasoning of this -- of this case

24

and of the courts below, whether the treatment

25

prescribed by the doctor is simple or complex, whether
46

1

it is costly or cheap, will have to be provided by the

2

public school, whether that treatment might be sterile

3

catheterization, which prior tc CIC was considered the

4

treatment of choice.

5

knowledgeable of the current standard of practice,

6

prescribes sterile catheterization or another procedure

7

to empty the bladder called purveying the bladder, and

8

delegates that treatment tc the school, under the

9

reasoning of the courts below, the school will have to

10

provide it or will have to challenge that prescribing

11

physician over his standard of medical practice.

12

They'll either have to do it or be subjected to having

13

knowledge it's net the current treatment of choice and

14

get going on and doing what the doctor prescribed.

15

QUESTION;

If a doctor, who may not be

you’re not asking us to disagree with the court of

17

doctors and medicine and things like that?
