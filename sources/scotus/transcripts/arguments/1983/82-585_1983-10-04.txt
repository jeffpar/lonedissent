ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. GRIFFITH, ESQ.,

OR BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

5

MR. GRIFFITH;

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
%

These consolidated cases are on appeal from

the Supreme Court of Hawaii.

10 issue,

11

They present a single

whether a Hawaii tax of 3 percent of the gross

income of airlines from the airline business is exempt

12 from the section of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.,
13

Section 1513, which forbids a state from levying a tax

14 on the gross receipts derived from the carriage of
15

passengers or the sale of air transportation.
The Hawaii Supreme Court upheld the Hawaii

16
17

tax.

Its decision thus conflicts with the holdings cf

18 the other state courts which have considered the same
19

issue,

namely, the highest court of the State of New

20

York,

21

Court of Alaska, all of which have struck down similar

22

state taxes because cf this federal statute.

23

the State of Ohio, the Attorney General rendered an

24

opinion that the Ohio tax was invalid in view of the

25

federal statute, and the Ohio legislature then repealed

the Court of Appeals of Arizona, and the Superior

the tax
Appellants Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian

3 Airlines are commercial airlines flying in federal
4 airways between the six major islands of Hawaii.
5

I will make three points on oral argument, and

6 only three.

First, the plain language of the federal

7 statute, 49 U.S.C.

1513, prohibits this tax.

Second,

8

the Hawaii tax can't be saved under subsection (b) of

9

that federal statute because subsection (b) is

10 consistent with subsection
11

(a).

And finally, the

legislative history of this statute requires a decision

12 in favor of the airlines in this case because Congress

13

meant exactly what it said in Section 1513, and it meant

14 to forbid precisely this kind of state tax.
15

With regard to my first point, that the

16 federal statute expressly prohibits the Hawaii tax, we
17

need examine only the gist of the Hawaii tax statute and

18

the key sentence of the federal statute.

First,

the

19 Hawaii statute says there shall be levied and assessed
20

upon each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income

21

each year from the airline business.

That language

22 conflicts directly with the federal statute which
23

provides no state — this is the federal statute — no

24 state shall levy or collect a tax, fee, head charge or
25

other charge directly or indirectly on persons traveling

4

1

in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling

2 in air commerce, or on the sale of air transportation,
3

or on the gross receipts derived therefrom.
This federal statute thus expressly prohibits

4

5 every conceivable method by which a state could tax the
6 carriage of passengers by air or the sale of air

7 transportation or the gross receips derived therefrom.
8

QUESTION:

How about a next income tax, Mr.

9 Griffith?

10
11
12

MR. GRIFFITH:

Subsection (b) expressly

permits a net income tax, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Is there all that much difference

13 between a gross income tax and a net income tax?
14

MR. GRIFFITH:

I think there definitely is.

15 gross income tax is a tax at the immediate point of
16

transaction between a passenger and the airline, cr

17 between a customer and the provider of a service, and
18 that is a tax which can easily be passed on dollar for

ig dollar to the customer.
20

QUESTION:

Well, you say that a gross income

21

tax is necessarily one on the passenger?

22

have thought so, or perhaps I misunderstood you.

23

QUESTION:

24 different ways,

I wouldn't

The statute is defined four

to hit a tax directly on the passenger

25 or a tax on the carriage of that passenger, cr a tax on

the sale of air transportation, or a tax on the gross

2

receipts realized by the airline.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but what I am try — what I

4 want to ask you is whether a gross income tax or gross

5 receipts tax on the airline that is collected at the
6

head office of the airline, it isn’t imposed on

7

passengers individually at all —

8

MB. GRIFFITH:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is that appreciably different from

10 a net income tax similarly reflected?
SR. GRIFFITH:

11

Very definitely different in

12 concept and theory, Your Honor.
13

QUESTION:

How?

14

MR. GRIFFITH:

Because a net income tax

15

depends cn many other factors besides the price of a

16

ticket.

17

depends cn many other things, including other deductible

18

state taxes.

19

It depends on administrative overhead, it

Many other deductions and concepts are

QUESTION:

New, the act does not prohibit, I

21

gather, a property tax or a franchise tax to be levied

22

bu the state.

23

MR. GRIFFITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct.

And what reason would Congress have

to forbid the use of gross receipts as a measure for

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

imposing a property tax or a franchise tax?

2

MR. GRIFFITH:

3

QUESTION:

4

HR. GRIFFITH:

Because Congress --

If the amount is the same?
Congress was very much

5

concerned about the price of air fares, and the fact is

6

that Congress as part of an overall federal program

7 levied an 8 percent federal excise tax on air fares.
8 did not want the states competing with that tax.

It

It did

9 not want the states adding an additional tax up on top
10 of the federal tax because that federal tax was the
11

prime revenue raiser to fund the Congress* airport aid

12 program, a program which funneled vast sums out to the
13

states for the development cf airports.
QUESTION:

14
15

Well, I Know that is what you have

argued on the purpose, but if the state can get the same

16 revenue and

just label it something else, it is little

17 hard to understand the position.

HR. GRIFFITH:

18

I am saying, Ycur Honor, that

19 the states cannot reach the same revenue through another
20

21
22

label.
QUESTION;

Well, now. Congress has amended the

law in a way that doesn't apply to the tax years in

23 question here.
24

MR. GRIFFITH:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

But they have since amended it, and

7

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

they have created a new exemption for in lieu taxes.
Sow, if that were applicable today, does that

2

3 have any implication on this?
4

HR. GKIFFITHi

Ho, it would not, Your Honor,

5

because Congress left the two Key sections we are

6

talking about,

7 undisturbed.

(a) and (b)

cf Section 1513,

It then added an in lieu tax, but that

8

would be taxes not prohibited by subsection (a), but

9

certain in lieu taxes in other areas providing that the

10

funds received from such in lieu tax go into airport

11

development and improvement.

QOESTIONi

14

Hr. Griffith, if you should prevail

15 here, is there anything to prevent the state from
16

turning around and levying even a higher income tax cn

17 y.our clients?

MR. GRIFFITH:

18

Nothing whatsoever except the

19 usual constitutional guarantees against unequal
20

treatment, but otherwise nothing whatsoever.

22 then here.

MR. GRIFFITH;

25

QUESTION;

We are willing to take that

That isn’t the only kind of tax

8

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

they could levy either, is it?

2

HR. GRIFFITH;

3 Justice.

The subsection (b) lists a whole litany of

4

That is correct, Hr. Chief

state taxes that are still permitted so long as they do

5 not reach head taxes, gross receipts taxes,

taxes on air

6 carriage, taxes on the sale of transportation.

So long

7 as the states will stay away from the area of

8 prohibition, they have freedom to tax the airlines like
9 any other business or citizen.

QUESTION;

10
11

If you were entirely an intrastate

airline, didn't fly over international waters, you would

12 have no case here,

would you?

HR. GRIFFITH:

13
14 Honor.

We would have a case, Your

I'll tell you why.

And the Arizona case was

15 exactly on this point.

Section 1513 speaks of persons traveling in

16

17 air commerce, and it also speaks in

terms of carriage of

18 persons traveling in air commerce.

Air commerce is a

19 defined term in the Federal

Aviation Act.

It has

20 several definitions, but one key definition is flights
21

within the federal air space.

22

airlines before you today are entirely within the

23

federal air space, so even if we were totally

24

intrastate,

25 fact,

The flights of the two

we would be covered by this statute, and in

I would remind you, in the Arizona case, Cochise

9

ACDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Airlines was flying between points in the State of

2

Arizona; it was stipulated that that was intrastate, but

3

because of that definition of air commerce, that

4

airline's flights clearly came within the scope of the

5

statute.

6

In subsection (a) Congress precluded all

7

traditional forms of tax by specifically prohibiting any

8

tax or any fee or any head charge, and it then went on

9

to try and preclude preventive minds by prohibiting

10

other charges to ensure that this prohibition would

11

encompass any prohibited tax, however labeled.

12

Second, Congress broadly defined the subjects

13 and measures of tax to be prohibited;

namely, taxes,

14

first, on persons traveling in air commerce; second, on

15

the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce;

16 third, on the sale of air transportation; and fourth, on
17
18
19

the gross receipts derived therefrom.
And then finally, Congress extended this
absolute prohibition to all taxes that are directly or

20 indirectly levied or collected on any of these
21
22

prohibited areas.
Congress thus meant to sweep the field clean

23 of state taxes on air carriage, on gross receipts
24

therefrom, and on head taxes.

The plain language, I

25

submit, of Sectin 1513(a) thus prohibits the Hawaii

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

tax.

.
Now, the Director of Taxation of Hawaii

2
3

attempts to avoid the effect of this language with

4

several theories, mostly looking to subsection (b) of

5

the federal statute, and our second major point is that

6

these arguments should not prevail because subsection

7

(b) is clearly consistent with subsection (a) which I

8

have quoted with you.

After sweeping the field clean of

9 gross receipts and head taxes. Congress added subsection
10

(b) simply to clarify which state taxes are still

11

permitted.

This section provides that states may levy

12 taxes other than those enumerated in

(a), and then it

13

lists property taxes, net income taxes, franchise taxes,

14

and sales or use taxes.
But the key clause in the subsection (b) is

15
16

taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a).

17 This clause clearly means that a state will be permitted
\

18 to levy a tax if but only if that tax is not based on
19

the carriage of passengers or the sale of air

20 transportation or the gross receipts derived therefrom.
21

The Director argues that the Hawaii tax is a

22

property tax and thus is permitted under subsection

23

because that is one of the listed taxes there, and he

24

relies on a phrase in the Hawaii statute which says

25

"this tax is a means of taxing the personal property of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

(b)

1

airlines and other carriers."

2

There are several flaws in this argument.

3

First,

4

receipts.

the Hawaii tax is actually based solely on gross
It therefore violates subsection

(a) and is

5 not permitted under (b) because the Hawaii tax is not
8 one of those taxes other than those enumerated in
7

subsection (a).

The Director, it seems to us, is

8 therefore asking this Court

9

to rewrite subsection (b)

and to ignore that clause, taxes other than those

10 enumerated in subsection (a).

11

But this clause cannot be

ignored.
Secondly, the Hawaii tax is in no sense truly

12

13

a property tax.

The tax return used requires

14

information only as to the airline’s gross receipts.

15

requires no information as to the airline’s personal

16

property.

17

the personal property, and Justice Jfarumoto in his

It

The tax is only labeled as a means of taxing

18 dissent below pointed out that Hawaii has no personal
19

property tax as such, and there was none at the time

20

this tax was enacted.

21

Federal standards are controlling here, and

22

for federal purposes, I submit this is not a personal

23

property tax.

24

The Director also argues that Section 1513(a)

25

prohibits only taxes on gross receipts and not property

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

taxes measured by gross receipts.

But I submit this

2 argument exalts form over substance and asks this Court
3

to disregard the broad sweep of subsection (a) which

4

forbids the use of gross receipts as the measure of a

5

tax as well as the subject of a tax.
Finally, the Director argues that the Hawaii

21

The Director argues the tax is a general

22 business tax which does not discriminate against
23

airlines because other businesses in Hawaii bear a

24

similar state tax on their gross receipts.

25

this argument is that unlike other businesses in Hawaii

wisdom. Congress determined that this federal tax is

4

steep enough and that the s tates cannot tax air fare s or

tax the gross receipts of a irlines from air

9

tax, thereby depriving the airport and airway

In i ts

Congress b elieved that any state ta xes

10 development program of the funds to carry out its
11
12

purpose.
Finally, my last argument, and I will be

13

brief, although resort to legislative history is not

14

required because I believe we have a very clear federal

15

statute here, I believe this legislative history clearly

16

tells us that Congress meant to say exactly what it said

17

in Section 1513, and meant tc bar precisely the kind of

18 tax here in
19

issue.

In 1970 Congress found that the nation's

20

airports and air control system were outmoded and

21

inadequate to handle the massive growth in air traffic.

22 Congress responded with a two-part program.

First, it

23 vastly increased grants of federal funds to the states
24

for airport improvement.

And second, to pay for this

25

program, it adopted a comprehensive and uniform program

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of federal taxes on passengers and on airlines.

That

2 comprehensive program has been considered and described
3

by this Court in Massachusetts v. the United States in

4

1978 in a very able opinion written by Justice Brennan.

5 The most significant tax in this federal program, and
6

the largest revenue raiser by far is the 8 percent

7 federal tax on all domestic air fares.

After this program took effect, Congress

8

9 learned of efforts by states and localities to impose
10 head taxes and gross receipts taxes of their own.
11

Congress regarded the state and local taxes as a threat

12 to the revenue base underlying the 1970 airport
13

development program, and in

1973 it enacted the Airport

14 Development Acceleration Act which included this federal
15

statute that I have been describing today, and it also

16 included an additional increase in grants to the states
17

for airport development.
In fact, in the years in issue, this fine

18
19

program has yielded $55 million to the State of Hawaii

20 for airport and airway grants.
21

aftert

That is the six years

1973.
Also, we note that Congress recently acted to

22

23 continue this program of grants and taxes until the year
24
25

1987.

So this decision is important.
The Solicitor General has filed an amicus

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

brief in support of the airlines in this case.

2

called

He has

the Hawaii tax a threat to the fiscal integrity

3 of the federal airport development program.

In the

4 Solictor General's brief he points out that if this

5

Court is to sanction the Hawaii tax, other states would

6

regard

the decision as an invitation to evade the

7 federal prohibition by labeling their gross receipts
8

taxes as a means of taxing personal property.

Surely,

9 Congress did not intend that its mandate be so easily
10

evaded or that its national fiscal program be so easily

11

undermined.
Congress in its wisdom has determined that the

12
13

steep federal tax on passenger air fares is all the

14 taxation that air carriage of persons should bear.

At

15

the same time, the federal government has distributed

16

subsetantial grants to the state, fueling a great

17

improvement in the nation's airports.
The plain words of the federal statute forbid

18
19

this Hawaii tax.

The Court should not embark on an

20

invitation to rewrite that plain language, and the

21

Hawaii tax should be stricken and the decision below

22

rev ersed.

23

Thank you.

ON BEHALF CF APPELLEES

MR. DEXTER:

2
3

please the Court:
I believe that Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian

4
5

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it

Airlines in the argument here have said nothing that has

6 not been substantially covered in the briefs.
7

So I

would like to focus this Court's attention on what I

8 believe to be some of the underlying practical
9

considerations that need to be considered and

10 undoubtedly are controlling in the disposition of this
11

case.
QUESTION:

12

Hr. Dexter, you will speak about

13 the language of the statute, won't you, because I have
14 gone through your brief and I do not find it quoted
15 anywhere.
16

SR. DEXTER:

Yes.

17 that question right now.

Well, let me just answer

The statute has to do with the

18

same user taxes that were preempted by Congress under

19

the Airport and Airways Development Act.

Congress had

20 imposed an 8 percent ticket tax on domestic flights, a

21

3

percent emplaning tax on international flights, and a 5

22 percent tax on air transportation of goods.
23
24

Now, 1513(a) simply prohibits a tax on the air
transportation of persons.

Also, it prohibits a tax on

25 the air carriage of persons in interstate commerce.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It

1

also prohibits a tax on the sale of air transportation.

2

Those are the three taxes that are prohibited.

Those

3 parallel, if you will, the federal taxes that have been
4 preempted by Congress, and as we have indicated in cur
5 brief, those deal with specific subjects of taxation.

6
7
8

Subsection (b) says except for the taxes
enumerated in subsection (a) —
QUESTION;

Mr. Dexter, you didn't mention in

responding to Justice Blackmun, or at least I didn't
10

hear you —

11

HR. DEXTER:

12

QUESTION;

What?
That the prohibition is not just on

13

taxing the sale of air transportation but goes a s they

14

are on the gross receipts derived therefrom.

15

MR. DEXTER:

But on the gross receipts derived

16

therefrom. Your Honor, as far as the legislative histor y

17

history is concerned, is traceable to a discrimi natory

18

Ohio tax on singling out airlines.

1

about trying to get at measuring the going concern value

It is measured.

HR. DEXTERs

What?
Is that statute quoted?
No, it is not, and we would --

10 there are some supplemental statutes we want to refer to
11

here in the argument, if I get to it — and we would be

12

glad to furnish a supplemental appendix to the court.
Let’s turn back to these practical

13
14

considerations that I wanted to talk about.
The Hawaiian tax here applies to all of the

15
16 income

from the business activities of these airlines.

17 That is the public service company tax.

The airlines

18

are here contending that only the tax as applied to

19

their receipts from air transportation of persons is

20

invalid, so they have asked for a specific deduction

21

from the tax.

22

invalid.

23
24

They are not claiming the tax is

In addition, the airlines' pay on their
nonoperating utility property a general business

25 privilege tax measured by 4 percent of gross receipts.

22

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

So they have paid into the state of Hawaii for the

2 purpose of conducting substantial business activities in
3 or 4

3 Hawaii as a public utility and otherwise of

4

percent of a tax — a tax on 3 or 4 percent of their

5 total gross income from that business.
6

Now, the Hawaii tax, indicating again the

7 nature of its franchise, the Hawaii tax is due January
8

1* measured by the receipts of the prior year for the

9 next ensuing calendar year,

very much like a franchise

10 tax for the privilege of doing business for the next
11

year, very much like an ad valorem property tax where

12 the tax is due on a specific date.
In contrast, the 1513(a) tax is on a

13
14

transactional type of tax fcr the furnishing

15

specifically of air transportation services.
So the tax computation under 1513(a) and the

18
17 actual

tax computation under the Hawaiian public service

18 tax are entirely different.
19

Now, the Hawaiian tax applies only to

20 intrastate business in Hawaii, considering the
21

interisland transportation as intrastate.

22 United

For instance,

Air lines, Northwest Orient, other airlines that

23 fly in and out of Hawaii that do not do intrastate
24 business pay no public service commission tax.

It is

25 only on those utilities conducting a substantial

intrastate business with employees, substantial

2

properties, substantial business activities there.

3

Now, the Hawaii tax also applies to all ether

4 utilities doing business in the State of Hawaii.

The

5 public service commission tax applies to all utilities.
0 Therefore, steamship companies, gas companies, electric
7 companies, motor carrier companies, telephone companies
8 and so forth all pay the same tax at the same or higher
9 rate than the tax impose on the airlines in question.

10
11

In addition, comparable taxes are paid by
every business in the State of Hawaii measured by gross

12 receipts with the exception of life insurance companies
13 and financial institutions.

Mr. Dexter, that argument would

7 protection, but it is that it violates a specific

MR. DEXTERs

9

Well, we think — well, let — we

10

think that (a) is talking about specific excise taxes

11

where airlines have been singled out for discriminatory

12

treatment such as the Ohio excise tax.
QUESTION*

13

just doesn't bear that construction, do you think?
MR. DEXTER*

to get at in (a)?

19 except for the taxes enumerated in

indirectly.

That is what all the legislative history is

22 about.

transportation is a tax of general applicability, don't

2 you think?

I don't see why a gross receipts tax on air

3 transportation or receipts is any less a tax of general
4 applicability than a net income tax on the revenue from
5 air transportation.

MR. DEXTERi

6

Well, but what I am saying is

7 that if you had — for instance, take the problem of the
8

net income tax you raised.

This Court said, I think, in

9 the Oakcoke Blue Company case that any deduction from
10 gross receipts that was not proportionate to the
11

receipts resulted in an income tax, so that when you are

12

talking about the differences between the taxes in terms

13 of labeled used in (b), it seems to me that that is
14 subsidiary to what was the general pattern of (a) versus
15

(b), and (a) was singling out airlines for

16 discriminatory treatment by indirect means — by
17 directly or indirectly imposing head taxes or comparable
18 taxes.

(b)

assured everyone that it did not include any

19 general applicable business taxes.

In my judgment, that

20

is — if you want to get a large framework to look at

21

the statutory language.

for airport development, or was it trying to immunize

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

Or let me put it this way

The issue, the way

that it is framed by the airlines, is by Congress

3 imposing a head — user taxes on you and me for the
4

purpose of airport development and improvement, it

5 intended to exempt airlines from their obligation to pay

6 their fair share of general business taxes on the
7 happenstance that those taxes historically were measured

8 in some states by gross receipts.
9

That in my judgment

is the basic issue here, and we don't think there is

10 anything in the Congressional record or history to
11
12

support that idea.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Dexter, supporting that you had

13

a — say you win this case, and there is another state

14

that doesn't have the same history of taxing in the way

15 you say Hawaii always has, but just decides, well, since
16

Hawaii can impose this tax, I think it's a pretty good

17

idea, let's impose a gross income tax in the language of

18

the Hawaii statute.

19

Would that statute be valid?

20

MB. DEXTEB;

21

brief two things.

Your Honor, we have said in our

One, we think that the Congress

22 intended by the legislative history to prevent head
23

taxes or that type of taxes, directly or indirectly? and

24

secondly, that Congress was concerned with the airlines

25

being singled out for discriminatory treatment.

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

So I would say if somebody wanted to impose a

discriminatory treatment, I think that this would very

well be prohibited by this statute.

the legislative history of this act about the Washington

In fact, the reason that we have published and

5

6 printed this 187 page volume is simply to demonstrate to
7 the Court that there is not one word in that volume
8 having to do with general business taxes except one

statement, and that was the statement of the
10 representative of the airline industry, Mr. Tipton, and
11

in reference to the Ohio discriminatory tax he said we

12 oppose this tax because it singles out and discriminates
13 against the airlines.
14

But he very definitely said that

the airlines had no objection in Chio or elsewhere of

15 paying

their fair share of general business taxes along

16 with other members of the business community.
17

And what I think is the real differentiation

18 here is there is a vast difference between being singled
1

out. Congress singling out an industry from general

20 business taxes for preferential purposes on

the

21

happenstance that they might — on the happenstance that

22

those taxes are measured by gross receipts.

There is a

23 vast difference between that and singling out the
24 airlines for discriminatory tax treatment by duplicating
25 federal head taxes directly or indirectly.

And I think

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 02S-0300

1

that is really the underlying question here.
I would like to emphasize, although I know

2
3

that I have had some problems with it with this Court at

4 the moment, but there is, there is a substantial
5

difference between the public service company tax, a

6 utility tax, and a tax directly on gross receipts.

Now,I know there’s much argument in the briefs

7
8 of the

airlines that there is no difference between a

9 measure and a subject matter of the tax, but I believe
10 if you do some real reflecting, you will have to realize
11

you have got to have a subject of a tax because you

12

can’t measure nothing.

There is in every taxing statute

13 that I have ever seen two things, a
14 measure.

Now, if the measure, the Court might say the

15 measure is the same as the subject and substitute, then,

in place these two things.

18
19

And we think this —

Well, the trouble is the statute

says the tax will be on gross income, and that sounds

20 like the subject to me.

HE. DEXTER;

21

Well, but then it turns around,

Yes, it does, yes, that’s the

4 last part of — that's the last part of 239-6.

6

So it

then if you look at the

definition of public utility in 269-1 of the Hawaiian

7 statute, you see that in the definition of the public

8 utilities they were trying to arrive at the growing
9 concern value of these franchises and properties used by
10 the utilities, and the easiest and most direct way to do
11

it was to measure that by capitalizing net income, which

12 we do many times in the utility field today, or

taking

13

the gross receipts.

And those really are the same as

14

property taxes because as was indicated, the 1982

15 amendment to 1513, by adding subsection (d)

clearly

16 indicates that in lieu of property taxes were covered by
17

(d), and (d) had to do with the property taxes permitted

18 under

(b), so that in lieu of taxes are within the scope

19 of property taxes under 1513.

And I would suggest if othey were not, then

20

21

the Four R legislation under the Railroad Revitalization

22

Act of

1975 and the same language in the Kotor Carrier

23

Act of

1980 would not become effective because on these

24

utilities they talk about ad valorem property taxes, but

25 obviously those statutes have been construed by the

So we think that traditionally in this
country, for over a century, property taxes on utilities

decisions of this Court that uphold it.

5

important example of legislative history, and it is set

6 forth in pages 22 and 25 of the brief of the State of
7

Washington and other states.

In those pages, this

8

was — Senator Cotton of New Hampshire wanted to

9 grandfather in the New Hampshire head tax,

so he

10

proposed to Senator Cannon, who was the sponsor of the

11

legislation, an amendment to grandfather in the head tax

12

of New Hampshire until the end of 1973.

13

Senator Cannon agreed to it.

14

said that this covers only the head tax now in effect in

15

the State of New Hampshire.

In that — and

And in agreeing to it, he

Now, the language submitted by Senator Cannon

16

17

I believe is set forth on page 79 of the legislative

18

history appendix is identical to the language of Sectin

19

1513(a).

In other words, that shows specifically a

20 legislative intent that they were talking about the
21

subject matter generally of head taxes, the direct or

22

direct imposition of them.

23

the gross receipts derived therefrom" is admitted by the

24

Air Transport Association, the Solicitor General, the

In fact, the language "or

25 airlines in question, to have -- to find its place in

1

the statutory language only to take care of the specific

2 excise tax imposed by the State of Ohio.
3

Ohio had

imposed on airlines alone an excise tax on air

4 transportation measured by the emplaning or deplaning of

5 passengers, and the airline association and others were
6 disturbed about that kind of specific discriminatory tax
7 against airlines, and everybody agrees, to the extent

8 there is any legislative history known about this, that
9 the phrase "or gross receipts derived therefrom" had to
10 do with that legislation.

And I would like to close by saying you can go

11

12 through this 187 pages of legislative history, you will
13 hear the words discriminatory taxes, head taxes,
14 equivalent taxes and abuses.
15

18

You will never hear one

word about any nondiscriminatory general business taxes

16 of any
17

or

state in these United States mentioned.
And I want to also tell you that if you decide

that Congress -- that the airlines’

position is right in

19 this case, you will have decided that Congress for the
20 first time in the history of this nation had singled out
21

one industry from discharging their general obligations

22 to state governments.
23

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. GRIFFITH, ESQ

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

3

MR. GRIFFITHS

4

Just a couple of quick points,

5

fly learned friend has described at length the

Thank you.

6 Ohio tax as a discriminatory one, but I would point cut
7 to the Court that the Tax Commissioner of Ohio appeared
8 before the House Commerce Committee and went to great

9

lengths to list the various Ohio taxes and to show that

10 in fact the Ohio tax was not discriminatory as compared
11

to the railroads, the truckers, or other businesses, and

12 he then submitted language to the Congress to permit a

13 nondiscriminatory gross excise tax.
14 declined his invitation.

The Congress

They did not accept his

15 language, and I think that tells us that Congress was
16 concerned about much more than discriminatory taxes.
17

Finally, I would just point out that the

18 Hawaii statute says that it is levied and assessed upon
19

each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income each

20 year from the airline business, and

then it goes on

21

later on to say that that tax is in lieu of the Hawaii

22

general excise tax which is also a gross income, gross

23 receipts tax.
24

I have no further points.

25

Thank you.
