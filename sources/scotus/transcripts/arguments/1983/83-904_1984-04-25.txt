MR. SHOOP;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court, on January 25,

1979, one Thomas Fill

with murder, and at the preliminary hearing stage,

County

Grand Jury found probable cause existed to

23

believ e that the defendant, respondent in this case, had

24

violated four separate criminal statutes and returned

25

one indictment charging this defendant/respondent with

3

1

one count each of murder, involuntary manslaughter,

2

aggravated robbery, and grand theft.
The defendant/respondent had already fled the

3
4

jurisdiction before the Grand Jury indictment had

5

returned.

State of Tennessee and returned tc the State of Ohio.

7

On October 9,

8

before the lake County Common Pleas Court for the

9

purposes of arraignment on the aforementioned indictment.

And 20 months later he was apprehended in the

1980, the defendant/respondent appeared

10

At that point, he proffered pleas of guilty tc

11

involuntary manslaughter and grand theft, and not guilty

12

pleas tc murder and aggravated robbery.

14

The State

Bond was set, and the case assigned to a

15

different trial court,

which had then tc decide whether

16

to accept the proffered pleas of guilty which the first

17

court reserved ruling upon.

18

following written arguments, without any testimony or

19

evidence even proffered, the trial court was persuaded

20

by the defendant/respondent to exercise its discretion

21

and accepted the guilty pleas on involuntary

22

manslaughter and grand theft.

On November 26, 1980,

25

Hr. Shcop, is that a common

and he said, "This is unusual; we will have to think

MR. SHGOP;

Net in every instance.

It is a lesser offense.
All right.
Cn November 26,

1980, following

10

the written arguments, without any testimony even

11

offered or proffered,

12

accept the guilty pleas, as I said.

13

the defendant/respondent tc consecutive sentences, three

14

to ten

Authority.

22

the trial court was persuaded to

That is -- in

And the second sentence was two to five

QUESTION;

It’s possible that he'd serve cry

five years altogether,
MR. SHCOF;

isn't it?
It is possible that he cculd serve

23

only five years, and likely that he would serve even

24

less because cf the Chic Adult Parole Authority's

25

interpretations and understanding and control of release

of those that are incarcerated under indeterminate

sen ten cing.
Following these pleas the defendant/respcndent

3
4

moved tc dismiss the murder and aggravated robbery

5

counts on the arounds of double jeopardy, arguing

6

multiple prosecution and collateral estoppel.
On March 31,

7

1981 the trial courts, after

8

briefs and arguments, again without any evidence or

9

testimony even proffered, granted the defendant's motion

10

to dismiss on the double jeopardy grounds.

11

the State appealed tc the trial court’s dismissal cf the

12

murder and aggravated robbery.
QUESTION:

13

Thereupon,

Mr. Shcop, you mentioned that the

14

motion

15

ordinarily expect testimony in connection with a motion

16

tc dismiss cn double jecpardy grounds?

17

was granted without any testimony.

MR. SH00F:

that the two offenses are mutually exclusive.

What do you think the Supreme Court meant in

16

In

its opinion?

What is it holding?

MR. SHOOPs

17

I couldn't understand.

I agree with Justice O'Connor.

I

18

have the same apprehensions through every decision of

19

each court and judge, except for the dissenting judge,

20

Judge locar in the Chic Supreme Court, "They have

21

misunderstood and misapplied all the Elcckburger double

QUESTION;

Well, do you know which the court

was holding?

8

MR. SK00P:

1

I can only understand from all of

2

the court’s holdings in Chic that there is no decision

3

that we can find which specifically states that murder

4

or involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included cffense

5

of the crime of murder.

6

he cites State v. Willis fcr supporting that

7

proposition, and upon perusing State v. Willis you’ll

find out that that is -- or have found cut -- that that

instrument, has nothing to do with the crimes of murder

11

cr involuntary manslaughter.
QUESTIONi

Are the two offenses mutually

exclusive ?
MR. SHCOFj

14

In my argument I say yes, they

And the difference is that, as the courts telcw

15

are.

16

have tried to interpret the mental states requisite in

17

order to include these in the Blockturger test or under

18

Chic Revised Code 2941.25, which is our multiple counts

19

statute, they have attempted tc say that the mental

20

state requisite in murder, which under the laws of the

21

State of Ohio is purposely,

22

fulfilled with any lesser mental state which may be

23

encompassed in the involuntary manslaughter charge.

State ground?
MR. SHOOP:

11

I would have to state that armed

12

robbery — excuse me --.aggravated robbery and grand

13

theft,

14

verbiage that was used, aggravated robbery can be

15

charged either as threatening the force or, in the

16

second section, having a concealed weapon or weapon upon

17

their person, whereas theft then would only encompass

18

the theft.

19

that because of peculiarity in the charging

I would say that that, because in this

20

instance of the charge and the way it was framed, that

21

in this instance .1 would have to agree that probably the

22

theft and the aggravated rettery have teen charged as

23

lesser included offenses.

QUESTION;

This takes me,

regard as a very strange rule,

10

of course, to what

this syllabus rule you

I

1

have in the State cf Ohio, and I'm net sure it's in

2

effect anywhere else.

3

that side of the four issues, it sounds to me like it's

4

all state law.
ME. SH00P;

5

Eut as I read the syllabus cn

I don't believe that it's all

6

state law, because they apply all of the Elcckburger

7

tests in their application and understanding.

they’re using 2941.25 cr they're using just the dcuble

Whether

10

to this situation and their understanding and their

11

interpretations of even the state statutes is all dene

12

in liqht of federal double jeopardy standards, case law,

13

and decisiens.
I did not quite finish with Justice O'Connor's

14

15

question, but I believe that the separation of the

16

murder and the involuntary manslaughter can be shown

17

under

18

murder

19

the involuntary manslaughter may be totally absent cf

20

any mental state requisite tc causing the death of an

statute is purposeful, and the mental state in

QUESTION:

When the trial judge indicated h<=

24

was ooing to accept these pleas, did the State ever

25

propose dismissing those charges and going ahead cn

11

1

murder and aggravated robbery?

2

MR. SHOOPi

No, the State did not.

We never

3

proposed dismissing those charges because case law in

4

the State of Ohio up to this point had not said anything

5

that gave any indication that involuntary manslaughter

6

in this specific case could be a lesser included offense

7

of the crime of murder in this specific case.
We had no indicat ion until we got

to Johns on,

that the court was going to make any kind of

ruling with this regard.
QUESTION;

11

May I ask, though, in Johnson

12

itself, did the Ohio Supreme Court upheld that

13

involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of

14

murder?

I do not believe that they stated

QUESTION;

Is there any difference between the

21

two offenses as a matter of Ohio law, ether than the

22

mental state of the defendant?

23

MR. SH00P;

24
25

Yes.

And that is what I was

trying to explain.
QUESTIONi

What is there, other than the

12

1

mental state of the defendant, that is different between

2

the twc offenses?
MR. SHOOP;

3

We have a lower offense which has

4

a separate, distinct element necessary in its proof, and

5

a higher offense which also has a separate and distinct

6

elemen t.
QUESTION;

7
8

And what is that element, apart

from the mental state of the defendant?
MR. SHOOP;

It is only mental in — that is

MR. SH00P:

Initially, the limitation would be

All right.

14

Now,

right there the

1

first cne is "Aggravated rettery is an allied effense cf

2

similar import to theft."

3

said earlier that indicates that theft is an element of

the offense of aggravated retbery.

MR. SH00F:

MR. SKOOP;

paragraph 2 says?

Now, that's -- you, I think.,

Yes.
For double jeopardy purposes.
For double jeopardy purposes, I -How does that differ from what

involuntary manslaughter share the common element cf

ME. SHGOP;

14

Yes.

To me.

Now, is that

And I believe it has

15

been to every court that has attempted to understand

that reasoning.

be wrong, but that's ycur law apparently.

MR. SH00F;

That's ycur

21

In cur hearts, we know there has only been one death,

allowed to do this.

But the State specifically set up

15

1

convictions, even under the federal guidelines in one

2

proceeding.

And we have to keep that in mind.

Under the federal law, we are still under one

3
4

proceeding.

The courts below have adopted this duality

5

of purpose cr subject to future events, causing this

6

case to now be here before this Court as if it is a

7

legitimate double jeopardy application.

8

9

presumes an intended result, we certainly hope.

We have net
The argument

Bu if we reach that upon remand and the case

10
11

is remanded, then we can address the questions, and

12

there are safeguards within the state statutes to

13

protect the rights so that an individual cannot be

14

charged.

15

The intent -- it is very important, I

16

believe,to understand that the mental state in murder

17

relates to the mental state, the culpability of taking a

18

person’s life.

19

the courts tried to attach in the misdemeanor cr in the

20

involuntary manslaughter has nothing to do with taking a

21

person *s life.

The mental state requisite, if any, that

22

The mental states are entirely different. The

23

element of theft or discharging a firearm within a city

limits, discharging a firearm, requires no requisite

Ycu said they are entirely

MR. SHOOPi

Correct.

In the higher crime, the

mens rea goes to the intention cf killing scmecne.
QUESTION;

They are different, I take it ycu mean, in

But then if he's guilty of

involuntary manslaughter, he cannot be guilty cf murder.
MR. SHOOP:

QUESTION:

10

I disagree.
Well, how can he have both nc

mental state and the wrong mental state?

12

understand that.
MR. SHOOP;

13
14

(laughter.)

16

MR. SHCOP:

17

QUESTION:

Ihey could be mutually —
On that point, you said they were

mutually exclusive, did ycu not?

19

MR. SHOOP:

QUESTION;

21

Ah, now we're beginning to

I don't

That is -- that is my argument.
But if that's so, if you find that

MR. SHOOP;

23

QUESTION:

Nc, I didn't say the -Well,

you said that.

Now, if the

24

person

then is found guilty or pleads guilty to

25

involuntary manslaughter, that would be the equivalent

17

1

of an acquittal on murder, and you'd be collaterally

2

estopped for going from there.

3

NR. SHOOP;

4

No, I did not say -- I hope I did

not.
QUESTION:

5

I thought you did in response to my

6

question, that you believed that it was mutually

7

exclusive.
ME. SH00F:

8
9

your question as to the mutual exclusive proposition.
QUESTION;

10
11

Then I perhaps did not understand

Ycu don't think they’re mutually

exclusive.
NR. SHOOP;

12

Nc.

I believe they are entirely

13

separate offenses.

And if allowed to be tried, we may

14

be able to establish that they are not even lesser

15

incluled offenses, and be allowed to convict and charge

16

on both.

17

QUESTION;

Put then, if I understand ycu --

18

QUESTION;

-- your question of lesser included

19

offense, as between first degree murder and

20

manslaughter, you never had your chance -NR. SHOOP;

21
22

We've never had that opportunity

to present that one full litigated issue or trial.

We have not had cne full hearing

yet.
QUESTION;

3

Mr. Shcop, let me go back, if I

4

may.

The Ohio Supreme Court said

that involuntary

5

manslaughter involves a lesser mental state, and T think

6

you've agreed that they're different, as it is "killing

7

which prcximately results from the defendant's

8

committing or attempting tc commit another cffense.

9

is manifestly obvious that these two states" -- and

It

10

understand, that's two states cf mind -- "are mutually

11

exclusive and that in any given killing, the offender

12

may be possessed of only cne."

13

As I understand you, you disagree with that?

I would think that I would ask the

Court to accept —
QUESTION;

19

Sc we should follow you, rather

than the Ohio Supreme Court.

17
18

Absolutely.

And to disagree with what the Chio

Supreme Court said about Ohio law?
ME. SH00P;

21

I understand.

Because they are

interpreting Ohio law and that statute in light cf

MR. PUROLA:

QUESTION:

And this Court could

Only, sir, if -I can assure that, speaking for one

21

member of the Court, the Ohio syllabus rule would have

22

no weight with me whatever when it would permit a court

23

to hide behind -- or to decide a federal question, and

24

insulate it from review here by this specious kind cf

25

cha rad e.

22

MR. PUROLA:

1

The only way they could do that

2

sir, would le if the syllatus was a mask, and clearly in

3

opposite to what the controlling language in the opinion

4

was.

5

I would point cut that in Zacchini v.

6

this Court recognized in an opinion by Justice White

7

that you will lock to the syllatus to define the law cf

8

the case that it is controlling.

I don't think that would happen all the time, tut

I have no doubt whatever, however, that if the

11

12

not hide behind that local rule to prevent review here.
QUESTION;

13
14

If you know, why does the Ohio

court file an opinion?
MR. PUROLA:

15

If you know.
The Ohio jurisprudence,

16

Your Honor, is that the opinion is to explicate the

17

facts cf the case,

19

facts of the case.

value?

and the syllabus that goes with the

Is the opinion of any precedential

I don't know, sir.
It's to expound on the facts that the

21
22

particular case that gave the genesis to the syllabus

23

was abcut.

24
25

Put, in any event -QUESTION;

Mr. Purcla, as to the second

paragraph of the syllatus in this case, dealing with

23

1

murder and manslaughter, it just says basically that the

2

prohibition v. double jeopardy requires the result,

3

it isn’t clear from the syllabus alone whether it’s the

4

federal prohibition of some state requirement.

5

find

Now, doesn't Zacchini v. Scripps-Hcward

6

indicate that under those circumstances, we go ahead and

7

read the opinion tc see if the reliance was on federal

8

or state law?

9

MR. PUROLA:

Precisely, Justice O'Connor.

10

That’s exactly what happened in Zacchini.

11

was just as unclear.

12

QUESTION;

Right.

The syllabus

Sc we go ahead and lock

13

then at what the opirri.cn said, at least as to that

14

murder manslaughter question, and when we do that,

15

doesn't it show us that the court was relying on federal

16

law as tc the murder manslaughter issue?

17

MR. PUROLA;

I cannot argue that federal

18

considerations are not present in the opinion.

I do

19

argue that it is not clear tc me that the rule of

20

Michigan v. Long was ever written to contemplate that

21

kind of a situation, where one syllabus is clearly on

22

state law and the other may be on federal law.

23

I think if it were just the second syllabus

24

QUESTION;

Well, you have two issues.

25

24

You

1

have the theft aggravated rctbery that you can treat

2

separately, and then you have the murder manslaughter

3

issue,

4

dcn't you?
ME. PUEOLAi

I think, however, that the long

5

decision requires the Court to lock at the opinion, to

6

determine if within the four corners of it there is an

7

explication of some independent state law ground.

8

think that even though there are references to double

9

jeopardy law in the syllabus, the state law analysis,

And I

10

partially that referred to by Justice Stevens on these

11

solely on state grounds to be a potential risk.

MR. PUROIA:

Yes. Tha would be clearly state

law only at the point.
In the event, however, that the judgment below

20

is found to be based at least in part cn federal law,

21

it's my position that the double jeopardy clause

22

prohibits further prosecution in this case.

23

The first and foremost point that must be

24

considered over and ever again as far as the respondent

25

is concerned is that he has been convicted by a valid.

In my view, that implicates the second prong of

11

the North Carolina v. Pearce test that is the analysis

12

of the double jeopardy protection where there has teen a

13

prior conviction.

14

this case, and it is an extant conviction for the saire

facts.

There has been a prior conviction in

9

that at the general issue, at the arraignment, the

11

the statutorily authorized pleas which are, I think,

identical to the federal pleas — guilty,

That's the only reason, I gather.
Yes, sir.
Otherwise, I assuire you would have

6

QUESTION:

Right.

That was the reason.

7

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Purola, to the extent

8

that the double jeopardy clause was designed to prevent

9

a defendant from going through the anxiety of twice

10

being forced to go to trial, it seems to me that its

11

purpose isn't served by allowing the defendant himself

12

to force entry of a plea and avoid not only two bites of

13

the apple by the State, but even the first bite.

14

MR. PUROLA:

Justice O'Connor, I don't agree,

15

respectfully, with what I think is the underlying

16

premise to your question.

17

jeopardy clause is at all implicated until the State's

18

right to a trial has grown or has appeared.

19

arraig nment, they do net have an independent cognizable

20

right to a trial.

21

QUESTION:

I don't think that the double

And at the

Well, the point is, the State has

22

never been given an opportunity for even a single trial,

23

and the defendant has teen in the position of himself

24

forcing this situation and asking for it.

25

little hard to see hew the policies behind the double

30

Sc it's a

1

jeopardy clause are served ly applying it in these

2

circum stances.
MR. PUROLA;

3

Well, I think that the double

4

jeopardy clause might reach its highest point if this

5

further trial is protected or is precluded, because it

6

is precisely this present conviction, brought upon by

7

this accepted final plea, that makes this case just like

8

all others in which a prior judgment has precluded the

9

trail.
And I think that it is not our position to

10
11

suggest at all that the State has an independent right

12

to trial.
CUESTICNi

13

May I ask — Justice C’Conncr

14

suggested that the judge was forced to accept the plea.

15

As a matter cf Ohio law, did he have the alternative to

16

decline to accept the plea?
MR. EUROIAi

17

Without question, Justice

18

Stevens.

19

question of state law discretion.

20

discretion in favor of the plea.

21

And that if there is error in that, that’s an Ohio

22

problem which should be corrected there, but it is net a

23

matter of federal constitutional law.

25

One of my arguments is that it is purely a

CbESTIGN;

Mr. Furcla, you say that the

QUESTION:

Well, one difference,

I suppose, is

22

that the State did have an opportunity to proceed to

23

contest a judgement in at least one of its count.

24
25

MR. PUROLA:

That’s correct, sir, but that is

only important if somebody wants to equate the State’s

right to proceed with the defendant *s right to be free

2

frcir. former jeopardy.

And I dc not equate those.

3

I think that the State’s right to proceed is

an independent right coming from the Executive Branch,

and it has got nothing to dc with the defendant's

protection v. governmental oppression, which I consider

7

this a

moderate form of, net a great form.
With regard to the normal protections

things must be satisfied:

MR. PUROLA;

The same offense question is

obviously a constituticnal prerequisite tc any sericus

25

to theft and robbery.

There have been questions this

34

morning or this afternoon, regarding whether or net the

2

manslaughter and murder are the same offense, or at

3

least are they lesser included offenses.

4

don't think that you can doubt that they are the same

offense for double jeopardy purposes, though I'm net so

6

sure that I would want to venture a guess on whether or

not they're a lesser included offense either, except for

That’s right.

prohibition v. more ttian one conviction -- and I think

14

in my petition, or I mean my brief in opposition to the

15

petition for certiorari, I suggested that what Jchrscn

16

really did here was decide himself which two would be

17

dismissed, instead cf waiting until there was a multiple

18

conviction and letting the judge decide, because it

19

wouldn't take much imagination to determine which the

judge would dismiss at that point, and it wouldn't have

2

to make two proceedings out it rather than one.
ME. EUROIA:

3

The fundamental difference with

4

Jeffers, however, Jeffers did three things.

He first

5

denied

He secondly

6

overtly opposed trial together on the offenses, the 846

7

and. 846 section, and (3) he never tcld the trial judge

8

or the prosecution what might be happening.

that the twc offenses were the same.

Kenneth Johnson dees not fit any cf these,

9
10

because again I have to point out that in Jeffers there

11

was an arraignment and a not-guilty plea and two trials

12

scheduled.

13

attorney in that case — becomes an integral part cf the

14

case.

15

When that happens, the prosecutor -- U.S.

One cf my majer points in this Court is that

16

on state law, when the arraignment is the first

17

opportunity one has to plead tc the indictment, a plea

18

of guilty will obviate the necessity of the prosecutor's

19

involvement with regard to that and eliminate the

20

necessity of a proceeding on the same effense.

21

That is different than Jeffers.

Jeffers did

22

clearly deny that the two offenses were the same.

23

Johnson took precisely the opposite tack.

24

wanted two separate trials cnce the issue was joined.

25

That's not what happened here.

41

Jeffers also

The issue wasn't joined

1

at all on the involuntary manslaughter and the theft,

2

and clearly the court knew what the defendant's motion

3

was going to be after the plea was accepted.
In fact, what this points to is that this

4
5

somewhat unusual set of proceedings is maybe an aberrant

6

state law arrangement.

7

matter

8

implicated if this whole problem could have been

9

corrected or could be corrected by a state law ruling or

It maybe isn't a double jeopardy

because the double jeopardy clause shouldn’t be

10

a state law modification, which I think is an excellent

11

reason for this court not to produce a decision on the

12

double jeopardy clause on this fact setting, which is

13

unusual, likely to be unrepeated, at least in most

14

cases,

15

to handle this position.

and I think that the state law thing is the way

16

The government argues in the amicus brief cf

17

the United States that they would just suggest to you,

18

if this were a federal case, that the plea be vacated

19

because it's beyond the power cf the federal court tc

20

accept it.

21

That isn't the rule in the federal courts

22

either.

23

suggest that, if not order it.

24

not a matter for this Court to decide.

25

But this Court clearly, under its power,

cculd

But in state law, that's

With regard to why a second trial now, or a

42

1

trial new will be a second prosecution -- and I point

2

out that Pearce uses the word "prosecution," not "trial"

3

-- would violate the double jeopardy clause is that this

4

is a guilt-related ending of the first proceeding which

5

is significantly different than other interruptions in

6

proceedings that are net guilt-related.

7

difference has always made a -- I mean that distinction

8

has always made a difference to the court.

9

And that

In this particular case, Johnson's guilt was

10

established on the very first day, at least to the facts

11

that took place on January 25, 1979.

12

QUESTION;

Mr. Purola, may I ask one other

13

question about the situation immediately before the

14

guilty plea was accepted?

15

cculd the prosecution have dismissed the involuntary

16

manslaughter charge or could you have prevented that?

17

MB. FUROIA;

As a matter of Ohio practice,

I could not have prevented it,

18

Justice Stevens.

19

And I guess the timing is important.

20

arraignment on October 9th did not result in the final

21

entry of any plea.

22

to the judge that drew the case, and it wasn't finally

23

decided until the following month.

24
25

He could have nolle’d it at his will.
The original

That judge reserved ruling, sent it

With regard to one issue that may seem to be
in this case, the idea of continuing jeopardy, one that

43

f

1

this Court has grappled with, if not directly, at least

2

tangentially recently.

3

jeopardy has never been undertaken, at least in the

4

sense cf Justice Holmes’s dissent, to be an acceptable

5

way of

6

It’s clear that continuing

analyzing double jeopardy principles.
This case is much like Reed v. Jones in the

7

sense that no analyis could allow the prosecution to go

8

forward on the theory that Hr. Johnson is still in

9

jeopardy, and that’s why I think the case decided last

10

Wednesday about Lydon talks about the termination.

11

I think that ends the jeopardy, because the

12

justifications for a continuing jeopardy referred to in

13

last week’s case all seem to be met in this case, and I

14

don’t think this would be the case, if this Court were

15

ever inclined to adopt a continuing jeopardy notion to

16

perhaps give the State the right to stay in the case, I

17

don’t think this would be the case to adopt it in,

18

though I certainly don’t suggest it should be adopted at

19

all, but ideas of fairness to society, lack cf finality,

20

and limited waiver are all, in this case, resolved in

21

favcr cf the respondent.

22

Put

It may not be what all would choose, but the

23

fact that Mr. Johnson has been convicted of involuntary

24

manslaughter and been imprisoned for the maximum term

25

allowed by state law, by the trial judge, is fair to

44

1

society.

He is not escaping this conduct.

He was

2

consequently, or in addition, was sentenced

3

consecutively for the theft which was never challenged.
It is final, another suggestion in

4
5

Justice White’s opinion last week that deals with

6

continuing jeopardy.

7

obvious need tc not have this ever with.

8

and there’s clearly no waiver of Hr. Johnson’s right to

9

end his case.

This is final.

Hy time is nearly over.

10

There isn’t any
It is over,

I would like tc end

11

by saying that this unique case is not the vehicle, in

12

my view, to change again the principles of double

13

jeopardy that have started tc be changed in recent

14

years.

without — or *67 -- without ever incorporating the

double jeopardy prevision as v. the states.

19

HR. PUROLA:

Precisely.

And some states took

an entirely different view cf double jeepardy, notably

21

Connecticut, prior to 1969.

22

principles cf cases like ex parte Lang and Perez and

23

Nielsen are sufficient to govern double jeopardy

jurisprudence.

case, is not one where this Court should attempt tc

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

MR. SHOOP;

15

Do you have anything

Just a few comments, Mr. Chief

Justice.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. SHOOP, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. SHOOPs

The Fifth Amendment provisions and

16

protections that have steered this entire case through

17

the courts rely upon prohibitions against unlawful

18

government oppressive practices, protections afforded tc

19

the accused.

20

In Singer, though, the Court — this Court --

21

has stated that the State and the government does have a

22

right tc one full trial.

23

has been no State action by the prosecutor, by the State

24

of Ohio, that is oppressive, that is burdensome, that is

25

placing an extra burden upon this accused.

And we ask for that.

46

There

All that has

1

happened is he has chosen to attempt a ploy that would

2

now put restrictive and very binding confines on the

3

application of the double jeopardy provisions to the

4

State in these matters.
2941.25 of the Chic Eevised Cede is a

5
6

statutory embodiment of the federal law in this area,

7

and it’s intended to extend, by statute, the protections

8

of the Fifth Amendment to the defendant and, in doing

9

so, it extends also the weighing and balancing tests

10

that must be performed and the intended protections must

11

be weighed v. the public interest, both by the double

12

jeopardy previsions and by 2941,25.
The State did exactly what it was required to

13
14

do.

The defendant has artifically attempted to create a

15

double jeopardy problem where one dees not exist.

16

ask you to reverse and to remand and to strongly

17

indicate to the courts cf Ohio hew to properly

18

understand and interpret similar acts and lesser

19

offenses under the Elockburger test, according to the

20

double jeopardy standards that they have attempted to

21

apply.
