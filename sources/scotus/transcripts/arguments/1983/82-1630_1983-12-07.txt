CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Broaddus, you may

proceed when you are ready.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM G. BROADDUS, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER AND CROSS RESPONDENT
MR. BROADDUS:

6
7

please

the Court:
The two petitions in this case bring before

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

this Court two important constitutional issues

10

pertaining to prison administration.

The first issue,

11

that presented by the Petitioner, is whether a prison

12

inmate has some reasonable and legitimate expectation of

13

privacy while in prison so that he is entitled to the

14

protection of the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth

15

Amendments against allegedly unreasonable searches.
The second issue, that presented by the Cress

16
17

Petitioner, is whether a prison inmate whose property

18

has been destroyed by the random unauthorized but

19

unanticipated act of a guard has in law been deprived of

20

property without due process when the state provides

21

adequate post-deprivation remedies which are adequate to

22

make the inmate whole.
These issues arose out of an incident which

23
24

occurred at Bland Correctional Institution in September,

25

1981.

Eland is a state run penal facility which houses

450 felons
According to the inmate's complaint the prison

2
3

guard conducted a shakedown, that is,

4

locker but the shakedown was not routine and was

5

conducted for purposes of harrassment.

6

alleged that the guard destroyed some cf his property.

He further

Although the guard denied these allegations

7
8

a search of his

the District Court accepted them as true for purposes of
ruling

upon the guard's motion for summary judgment.

10

The trial court concluded that the allegations of

11

deprivation of property did not constitute a taking

12

without due process because of this Court's reasoning in

13

the case of Parratt v. Taylor.
The trial court also concluded that the

14
15

allegations of harrassment did not rise to the level of

16

a constitutional violation.

17

affirmed both of those rulings.

The Court cf Appeals

The Court of Appeals found that the inmate had

18
1

some minimal right of privacy entitled to protection

20

under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court of Appeals

21

ruled

22

established program or policy for random searches or in

23

the alternative that the guard had some reasonable basis

24

for believing that the prisoner possessed contraband.

25

The Petitioner submits the Court of Appeals

that a guard could not search unless there was an

4

1

erred with respect to this conclusion, and I would like

2

first to address this issue.

3

Court's prior opinions that an iron curtain does net

4

exist between the Constitution and our nation's prison.

5

It is equally clear, however, that prisoners suffer a

6

substantial reduction and even loss in many rights and

7

privil eges.
In each case before the Court determines that

8

9

It is clear from this

an inmate possesses a right it carefully weighs that

10

claim in light of the accute need of prison

11

administration for prison security because that is the

12

paramount need which prison administration is charged

13

with.

14

the effect upon the prison inmate.

Secondarily, it will weigh the claim in light of

With respect to the claim that a prison inmate

15
16

possesses a right of privacy this Court is well aware

17

from its many cases that prisons are dangerous places.

18

They are used to house dangerous men.
Inmates may seek to assault, to brutalize

22

inmates.

They may seek to assault guards.

They

The introduction of drugs and weapons into

23

this situation can only exacerbate an already dangerous

24

place and situation.

QUESTION*

General Broaddus, can I ask you a

5

1

questi on about the scope of your submission?

2

MB. BROABDUSi

3

QUESTIONi

Yes, sir.

As I understood your opening

4

statem ent you were suggesting that the Fourth Amendment

5

has no application to searches in the prison.

6

say th at there is no protection for the prisoner against

7

seizur es in searches.

You also

I notice the complaint alleges that the

8

9

office r shook down my locker and destroyed a lot of my

10

proper ty, that is, legal materials, letters and other

11

person al property.

12

destru ction of property.

It is not so much the search as the

Is there a protection against unreasonable

13
14

seizur es — That is what I am asking — as opposed to

15

s e a rch es.
MR. BROADDUS*

16

Justice Stevens,

with respect

17

to the destruction of property aspect, that, of course,

18

will b e controlled by Parrat v. Taylor.

19

the S3 izure of property we would submit that because

20

there is no legitimate expectation or right of privacy

21

that t he Fourth Amendment does not apply and that,

22

theref ore, a seizure would not be controlled by the

23

With respect to

Amendment but by some other aspect, if at all,

QUESTION*

Mr. Broaddus, I suppose that if I

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

ara a policeman and you are a suspect I may have a

2

probable cause that would justify my searching for and

3

seizing a gold ring in your possession that is maybe

4

worth $20,000, but the fact I may seize it in the Fourth

5

Amendment sense does not justify me in keeping it.

6

MR. BR0ADDUS:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is what you meant by the

8

Parrat rather than Fourth Amendment being applicable to

9

the property destruction?
MR. RROADDUS:

10

Yes, sir.

Of course, in

11

Virginia there would be many other ways in which the

12

inmate might recover that particular property, through

13

the inmate grievance procedure or through state

14

actions.

15

recover in that situation.

16

So he is certainly not without remedies to

In order to minimize the problems which are

17

brought about by the introduction of drugs and weapons

18

into prisons official surveillance is and as this Court

19

has noted traditionally always has teen the order cf the

20

day in prisons.

21

Court has established for Fourth Amendment cases which

22

emanated out of Katz and applied more recently in United

23

States versus Knox and before that in Smith v. Maryland,

24

one can only conclude that a prisoner dees not have a

25

legitimate expectation of privacy in prison.

If one follows the analysis which this

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

First, does the prisoner himself actually

2

expect privacy?

In this particular situation we know

3

from the prisoner’s affidavit that he and I quote,

4

"realizes routine shakedowns are necessary to properly

5

run a prison".

6

of privacy, but even if he did certainly society is not

7

prepared to legitimize such an expectation because

8

society has recognized the paramount needs of prison

So he himself had no actual expectation

administrators to search, to seek out weapons, to seek
10
11

out drugs and contraband.
Both society and inmates want prisons to be a

12

safe place, but they can only be safe if weapons and

13

drugs and contraband are kept out.

14

that because the prisoner does not expect privacy and

15

because society is not prepared and has not in any way

16

legitimized an expectation that he has no basis for

17

claiming privacy entitled to Fourth Amendment

18

protec tion.

1

QUESTION;

So we would contend

What if in a shakedown which you

20

say is perfectly permissible, a random shakedown,

21

suppose it is and the officer enters his cell and is

22

searching around and he just picks up a radio and

23

carries it out.

24

say the Fourth Amendment protection of effects just does

25

not apply in a prison?

He doesn’t destroy it, he just — You

BE. BROADDUS:

1

We would take the position.

2

Justice White, that it does not apply.

3

is not the case here.

4

destruction of property without due process —
QUESTION:

5

Of course, that

That was simply an allegation of

I know, but there was a seizure of

6

it.

7

I guess as the case comes to us we assume that it was

8

destro yed.

9
10
11

There is no question that there was a seizure, and

MR. BROADDUS:

That is the allegation, yes,

sir, which was —
QUESTION:

At least it was seized.

You say

12

that the prison authorities are completely free from any

13

Fourth Amendment restraints from seizing a

14

effects even if they are not contraband or even if their

15

possession is wholly consistent with prison rules.

16

MR. BROADDUS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BROADDUS:

prisoner's

Under the Fourth Amendment —

Is that right?
Under the Fourth Amendment,

19

yes, sir, we would.

20

right of freedom from seizures must be something

21

different and separate and apart from the taking of

22

property without due process.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I think that the Fourth Amendment

But it certainly is a separate

question from the search.
MR. BROADDUS:

Yes, sir.

In, for example,

1

Delaware v. Prouse which could be analyzed as a seizure

2

case the Court was concerned with the intrusion upon the

3

driver of a motor vehicle, his freedom from anxiety, the

4

limitation upon his movement and what not.

5

concerns*simply are not present in prisons.
QUESTION*

6
7

That may be.

Those

That is the argument

going to the search, the shakedown.

8

MR. BROADDUS*

9

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

But even on the search supposing

10

you had a prison system whereby they censored all the

11

incoming mail so it was all read before the prisoner was

12

permitted to have it and he gets his mail.

13

guard

15

There would be no Fourth

Amendment prohibition in that situation.
QUESTION;

16
17

go in and say, "I think I'll read your mail"?
MR. BROADDUS:

14

Could a

There would be no prohibition at

all then would there?
MR. BROADDUS;

18

Well, if that were to

19

constitute abuse then under the Virginia regulations

20

which prohibit guards from abusing inmates the inmate

21

1

Just what remedies are available

under state law in Virginia for redressing the property

would be made whole by payment of the value of the

QUESTION*

7

MB. BROADDUS:

If the radio could be valued he

Yes, sir.

Funds are made

available to the various institutions, and that is the
source of the payment.

10
11
12

QUESTION*

Who is it that makes the final

judgment in the grievance procedure?
MR. BROADDUS*

That ultimately goes up -- It

13

is a hierarchy level, if you will, sir, and depending

14

upon the nature of the claim it may be the

15

superintendent of the particular facility or it may be

16

the regional superintendent who has control of many

17

various facilities or it might be the deputy director of

18

the overall Department of Corrections.

If there is no right of privacy under the

20

Fourth Amendment then surely there must be no right of

privacy in a prison inmate —

I gather there is no judicial review?

MR. BROADDUS

1

2

That is correct, sir

There is

none.
We submit that there is no right of privacy

3
4

which a prison inmate possesses under the Fourteenth

5

Amendment.

6

right of privacy in his locker comparable to a woman's

7

fundamental privacy to an abortion or a couple's right

8

of privacy to practice birth control simply is novel at

9

best and to find such in a prison setting is simply

10

To suggest that an inmate has an intimate

untena ble.
The Court of Appeals' approach seemed to be

11
12

calculated to give a little bit to the prison

13

administrator and something to the prison inmate as

14

well.

15

baby but is simply unworkable.

We suggest that that approach not only splits the

Under the Court of Appeals' approach the

16
17

prison inmate would not have any greater enhanced

18

freedom from searches.

19

random

20

would certainly limit the capability of the guard to

21

make a search in a meaningful manner such that it would

22

deter the introduction- to prisons of weapons and drugs

23

and other contraband.

24
25

He would still be subject to

searches, but the Court cf Appeals' approach

Now the unreasonableness of the Court cf
Appeals' approach is demonstrated we believe by a 1976

1

University of Virginia Law Review article by Gianelli

2

and Galligan which was cited with approval by the ccurt

below.

promulgated on constitutional grounds before prison

guards may search.

That article suggested that a plan should be

It would require limitations upon the

frequency and the intensity of the search.

It would

8

suggest that if a guard was searching for a knife that

9

he would be able to search only in those places where a

10

knife might be found, and once the knife was found the

11

search would have to cease.
We submit that such an approach is

12

13

unreasonable and unworkable.

It simply tranforms the

Such an approach would simply increase federal

17

litigation without substantially advancing the rights of

18

prison inmates.

19

that the prisoner is without any protection whatsoever.

20

We do contend, however, that he may not wrap himself in

21

the Fourth Amendment and use the Fourth Amendment to

22

erect a wall between his activities and necessary

23

security activities undertaken to a properly run

24

prison .

25

As I have indicated we do not suggest

We urge this Court to hold that the Fourth

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Amendment is not applicable in a prison.

If the Court

2

rejects this position then we would further urge that it

3

should reject the requirement of the Court of Appeals

4

that random searches can be conducted only pursuant to

5

an established program or policy for such.
We would urge this Court to adopt an approach

6

7

which would say that all prison searches for security

8

purposes undertaken in a reasonable manner are per se

9

constitutional under the reasonableness clause of th

10

Fourth Amendment.

That approach would be comparable to

11

what this Court has utilized in the

12

States v. Biswolf which is not cited in our brief but

15

and reasonable suspicion were not present and there was

Finally on this point we would also urge the

17
18

Court to clarify that the normal rules of proof and

19

going forward in civil cases should control a 1983 claim

20

such as this and not the burden shifting approach which

21

the Court of Appeals seemed to adopt in what be more

22

appropriate in criminal suppression motions in criminal

23

cases.

24
25

I would like to turn now to a second issue,
that of the Parrat v. Taylor.

The Petitioner submits

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

that the line of cases beginning with Paul v. Davis and

2

going through Zimmerman Brush do not depend upon the

3

state of mind of the state actor or the state public

4

official charged with the wrongful conduct.
Indeed Paul v. Davis, Ingraham v. Wright, and

5

6

McCollan v. Baker, the action was at least arguably

7

intentionally undertaken.

8

depend instead upon whether the state was logically able

The analysis we submit must

to anticipate the wrongful act.
If the state was not able to anticipate the

10
11

wrongful act then it was not in a position to provide in

12

a meaninful manner a predeprivation hearing.

13

situation if it does go forward and provide in a

14

meaningful manner a post-deprivation remedy which is

15

capable of making the victim of the tort whole under

16

Parrat v. Taylor, the person has not been deprived of

17

procedural due process and has not lost property without

18

due process of law.

In that

In this situation we have only an allegation

1
20

of random conduct which was not sanctioned or condoned

21

by the state.

22

or pi a n.

23

It was not pursuant to an official scheme

Accordingly the state action is not complete,

24

and because the state action was not complete and the

25

state has provided meaningful remedies there has not

been a taking of property without due process of law.

2

In the reply brief the Cross Petitioner suggests that

3

the Petitioner seeks to constitutionalize the

4

deprivation of property without our argument.
If the state condoned the action here then

5
6

perhaps it would fall under Zimmerman Brush, but that is

7

not the case.

In conclusion, we would ask this Court to

13

reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals so that the

14

matter may be sent back to the District Court and have

15

that decision upheld dismissing the complaint.

can call for some kind of remedy?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH C. WYATT, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT AND CROSS PETITIONER
MS. WYATT:

7
8

Ms. Wyatt, I think you

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on summary judgment frcm a

9
10

suit against a guard himself who conducted what has been

11

described as a ransacking search of my client's locker

12

and destruction of his property for harrassment

13

purposes.

14

there is now to be drawn around prison walls an ircn

15

curtain for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

16

It presents two questions.

QUESTION:

First, whether

What would you say if in searching

17

the locker or the cell of the prisoner they found a

18

pistol or narcotics in an examination and seizure of

19

these things without a warrant?

20

about that?

21

MS. WYATT:

What would you say

I do not believe that under the

22

analysis of search and seizures and prisons that a

23

warrant is required, but I think we still might focus on

24

the justification.

25

harrass I think it would still be a harrassing search

If somebody went in to search to

and seizure
QUESTION :

2
3

Would it be admissible against him

in evidence?
MS. WYATT:

4

The pistol?

I think if it

5

violated the Fourth Amendment as the lav stands nov it

6

would not be admissible against him.
QUESTION:

MS. WYATT:
confiscated.

Yes, Your Honor.

It could be

Obviously it could be, but —

QUESTION:

Is that

your answer?

9
10

Would not be admissible?

How about heroin,

14 packages of

heroin in small packages for delivery?
MS. WYATT:

13

I think all of that would be

14

analyzed the same.

15

search, and that is quite broad in a prison context.

16

You can search randomly if that is your pattern in the

17

prison.

18

particular suspicion, and under either cf those

19

circumstances if you find the heroin, if you find the

20

gun they are, of course, admissible because that is a

21

reasonable search and seizure under prison

22

circum stances.

23

If the search is a legitimate

You can search an individual if you have a

But if you search to harrass for no other

24

purpose but to harrass then you have violated the Fourth

25

Amendment, and therefore the suppression issues would

A search for no legitimate purpose

at all •

7

What do you take the search to

find,

That is correct.

Not expecting to

not looking for contraband, not even doing this as

10

a deterrent.

I think prisons vould have the right tc

11

have a search policy as a deterrent, random searches,

12

and I believe the Fourth Circuit recognized that and

13

said that you could have a system of random cell

14

searches but there must be a system pursuant to which

15

the individual is being searched.

16

If you did it —

17

QUESTION;

New there certainly is a middle

18

ground between a system for searching, a prescribed set

19

of rules, and the harrassing search that you say is a

20

search simply to no purpose whatever.

21

that case a guard would simply figure he had nothing

22

else to do and would just want to wander through

23

people *s cells.

24
25

MS. WYATT;

I take then in

I believe if there is no

legitimate purpose it would be analyzed as unreasonable.

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and I think, in a prison situation we have obviously a

2

very broad standard of reasonableness.
QUESTION!

3
4

Are harrassing and no legitimate

purpose equivalent in the way you are using the terms?
MS. WYATT:

5

6

same.

7

purpos e.

Yes, Your Honor.

It would be the

Harrassing as I use it means not for a legitimate

If you have a suspicion that someone has

8

9

contraband even if you are lethally searching him for

10

that contraband that is not for a harrassment purpose.

11

The way I am using it is an abusive purpose.
You are picking on someone in your custody.

12
13

You are not doing it for any legitimate prison security

14

or administrative purpose.

15

summary judgment in this case.

16

QUESTION:

That is what we have on

So that is apart from any

17

requirement that there be rules or anything else?

18

take it your view is the Fourth Circuit could be

19

affirmed without laying down any requirement that there

20

be rules for Fourth Amendment searches in prisons.
MS. HYATT:

21

Absolutely.

I

In fact the question

22

presented is simply whether the Fourth Amendment applies

23

within prison, ani that is what the Fourth Circuit

24

held.

25

issues as burden of proof and, of course. Petitioner has

The Fourth Circuit did proceed to address such

1

argued

2

inccrr ectly•

3

that that has been shifted and shifted

I read the Fourth Circuit’s opinion

4

differently, and I read it to be that a prisoner must

5

allege an unreasonable search and seizure which is going

6

to be a very small range of searches or seizures in a

7

prison setting that will be unreasonable.

8

alleged that then the state can justify it if they do

Cnee he has

honestly justify it by saying that we have a pattern of
10

random searches or I had a particular suspicion about

11

this individual .

12

But to pick on the person, to do it abusively

13

for only the purpose of harrassment would be I think a

14

classic case of an unreasonable search and seizure and

15

perhaps one of the only cases of an unreasonble search

16

and seizure within a prison setting.

17

why Petitioner is retreated to a bright line request for

18

this Court.

1

I believe that is

I certainly suspect that Petitioner is not in

20

a position to request a bright line because Petitioner

21

knew that what Petitioner was doing was wrong, but even

22

if this Court felt that a bright line was needed I can

23

suggest another line that I think is equally bright in a

24

prison setting which is that it is unconstitutional to

25

search and seize for the purpose of harrassment.

I

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

think

that Petitioner’s position on the Fourth Amendment

2

is unwarranted.

3

that reason the Court should decline the invitation to

4

sweep away this constitutional right any more broadly

5

than necessary.

It is unsound, and I think that fcr

Again, the only question that has been framed

6
7

for this Court is whether the Fourth Amendment applies

8

in prisons, and indeed it should even though that may

9

only provide limited protection to a prisoner.
With regard to the second question in this

10

11

case,

that is, the due process issue and the question of

12

whether a due process violation, whether an intentional

13

abusive deprivation can ever violate the due process

14

clause when it violates a state’s own laws which is to

15

say when a state --

16

QUESTIONS

I am not sure, Ms. Wyatt, I observe

17

that in your cross petition you stated the question only

18

in terms of the due process violation, not a Fourth

19

Amendm ent.

20

MS. WYATTs

That is correct, Your Honor, in my

21

cross petition.

The Fourth Amendment issue was raised

22

in the original petition by the Attorney General’s

23

Office, and I am addressing now the issue I raised which

24

is the due process, whether an intentional, abusive

25

deprivation is totally unprotected by the due process

24

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

cla use
I think Petitioner who alleged that it dees

2

3

not has totally missed a major distinction in this case

4

which is a distinction between suits against higher

5

supervisory officials or otherwise against general

6

policies or procedures and challenges directly to

7

individuals who themselves have abused.

8

case understandably the analysis is going to turn on

9

whether a wrongful deprivation was pursuant to that

In the former

10

policy or was instead a random act not authorized by the

11

procedure, a fluke, or even an abuse under a procedure

12

where the risk of abuse is low as in Ingraham.
But that is not this case, and that analysis

13
14

does not apply to this case.

This case is a challenge

15

directly to the individual who abused, and in that sense

16

this case is governed by Screws v. United States and

17

Monroe v. Pape.
Both of those cases involved challenges

18
19

directly to the officials who abused, net to supervisory

20

officials.

21

it is no defense that the act is unauthorized.

22

defense that it is unauthorized even if that means that

23

a state then provides remedies and that, therefore, one

24

might be able to receive compensation in state courts.

25

This was rejected in Screws v. United States

In both of those cases the Court said that
It is no

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

where the Court cleanly held under a challenge to the

2

individual official that that intentional wrongful

3

deprivation violated the due process clause immediately

4

and state court remedies are completely and totally

5

irrela vant.

6

QUESTION:

Is there not a difference between

the facts in Screws and the facts here, though?

There is a difference.

MS. WYATTs

QUESTION*

15
16
17

A different kind of deprivation,

too, was it not?

12

14

That was a life deprivation.
It was all completed before there

was any possibility of a hearing.
MS. WYATTs

I think there could always be a

wrongful death action, for example, in state court.
QUESTION*

Well, would that make the person

18

who suffered the deprivation of life whole?

19

restore his life can you?

20

That was a

MS. WYATT*

You cannot

I think our principles of tort law

21

except the fiction that, for example, a suit for

22

wrongful death does make that deprivation whole, but I

23

certainly acknowledge that that is life and that when we

24

are looking at a procedure whether we are talking about

25

life, liberty or property may enter a Matthews v.

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Eldridge analysis because that is the weight of the

2

particular interest at stake.

3

But this Court has never severed property off

4

from the other rights, and the due process clause, of

5

course, mentions them in the same breath.

6

held was that it did not matter whether there were

7

remedies after the fact, that the deprivation

8

immediately at once violated the due process clause.

Shat Screws

In Monroe v. Pape, of course, we are talking
10

about the Fourth Amendment although the Court does not

11

focus very often and in fact I think gives only a

12

paragraph to which particular constitutional violation

13

was at issue.

14

very clear is the fact that abuse of power is really at

15

the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.

16

Another factor that both those cases made

QUESTION*

I am a little confused, Ms. Wyatt.

17

You probably can clarify it very quickly.

18

understand the Attorney General's Office in Virginia

1

appearing in the case because it is one of their guards,

20

one of their attendants that is involved, but is the

21

state as such a party to the litigation?

22

MS. WYATT*

23

QUESTION:

I can

Absolutely not. Your Honor.
What is the source of authority for

24

the court, any court, to lay down any regulations about

25

random searches or any other kind of searches in a

1

private lav suit between a prisoner and a guard?
MS. WYATT*

2

Your Honor# I think, that that

3

points cut a very important distinction in this case.

4

This case is not against a prison warden as in Parrat.

5

It is against the guard himself.
As in Honroe v. Pape there was an action

6
7

against the officials themselves, but the Court did not

8

find it difficult in that case to say the Fourth

9

Amendment had been violated.

10

A private suit.

are proper for adjudication.

MS. WYATT;

10

It is not a — The

It says no state.
Correct, Your Honor.

That is

11

exactly why I say that this case is mostly governed by

12

Screws and Monroe because that argument was presented in

13

both of those cases, and in both of those cases as in

14

United States v. Classic before the courted stated that

15

the misuse of state power,

16

state power can be attributable to the state itself in

17

the sense of the --

I think the law on that is quite

19

clear,

20

judgment on the state's deprivation of due process is

21

not to be pronounced solely on the basis of the action

of a guard or a warden.

was going to do this, or was this a random,

But that is not this

This case is a suit against the fellow who did

8

it.

This is a suit against the abusive guard himself.

10

The only cases that are that are very notable which

11

present such a challenge are Screws and Monroe, and the

12

analysis is not, therefore, the risk of error.

13

not, therefore, whether this was random, an unauthorized

14

and uncontrollable by the state.
Once you are suing the guard himself who

15
16

abused

17

does it matter that it is unauthorized, if it is

18

intentional —

1

It is

then you turn to Screws and Monroe when you say

QUESTIONS

Do you think Parrat would have come

20

out different if the two assistant wardens or guards in

21

the mail room had been sued rather than the warden?

22

MS. WYATT;

Parrat was a negligent case, ani

23

believe if you sued an individual who had negligently

24

lost property, and he said

25

property" that you would have no due process violation

"Yes, I negligently lost the

I

1

but you would have no due process violation because that

2

is negligent.

It is not an abuse of power.

I think, that when you are looking at the local

3
4

level, when you are looking at the specific officer it

5

makes all the difference in the world whether he is

6

abusing his power and acting under pretense of law or is

7

really involved in an automobile accident or computer

8

error.

Those are not under pretense of law.
QUESTION:

Then to your mind the distinction

10

really turns on negligence versus intent, not the

11

superior versus the actual actor.
MS. WYATT:

12

Your Honor, I believe it is both.

13

As I understood your question if I were suing — If we

14

were suing the guard himself and said, "You lost this

15

property.

16

negligence, not that he was trying to run him over, that

17

would simply not be a due process violation.

18

You hit me with your police car" and it is a

What we have, of course, at this level is an

1

intentional abusive taking, but both of those situations

20

are different from a situation where we are holding

21

higher people to account for policies, where we are

22

saying the procedures you have enacted do or do not have

23

a high risk of error.

24

risk of error.

25

many safeguards in Ingraham which prevented this, but in

In Logan there was a too high

In Ingraham there was not.

There were

31

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

all of those cases and in fact in most of the cases that

2

have been before this Court in due process situations we

3

have been looking at supervisory officials for their

4

policies and whether they allowed too many things tc

S

happen .
In that context I think negligence can state a

6
7

cause of action.

But if we are looking to the

8

individual himself for his own particular action I do

9

not think due process is implicated unless we are

10

talking about an abuse of power, and I think Screws and

11

Monroe made it very clear that an abuse of power was the

12

very target of the Fourteenth Amendment.

If an officer can walk up to someone and grab

19

his glasses off his face because he does not like him

and grind them into the ground, Petitioner’s argument

would say as long as there is a state tort of conversion

22

the victim of that abuse is confined to state court

exactly as if his neighbor had done that.

QUESTION 4

Screws says if you are an officer

MS. WYATT:

QUESTION:

7

MS. WYATT:

Your Honor, I believe —
Is that not what Screws said?
I believe we have Screws although

8

it is not life.

It is property.

He have at this point

9

in this Court the facts that this was deprived --

10

Property was destroyed for an abusive purpose only, and

11

by abusive I mean under pretense of law but for an

12

unauthorized or illegitimate purpose.

13

The hypothetical I was giving I think would

14

show that there is something inherently fundamentally

15

unfair about an officer on the street being able -- to

16

go back to the glasses analogy — to do that and to

17

confine somebody solely to state court.

18

QUESTION:

Why is that fundamentally unfair if

19

he will get paid at state court the same thing he will

20

get paid at federal court?

21

MS. WYATT:

Because there is something

22

different that has happened.

To say that is to say that

23

the action by the official is not different than the

24

action by the neighbor.

25

if we start also a new sort of layer of

11

distinctions here between property and life and liberty

it is going to be all the more confusing although it may

about how much process is due and when and how under

is no process, when there is an abusive taking it should

not matter whether it is life or liberty or this pen

forever.

think they are two separate ones.

I think again

10

that the due process clause itself recognizes a

11

prohibition against arbitrary use of power, and I simply

12

cannot believe that it any less protects against power

13

not arbitrary but abusive.

14

It says that an officer cannot pick on someone

15

for no reason.

16

someone — that an officer should be able to pick on

17

someone for a bad reason, for an abusive reason.

18

Certainly it cannot say any less that

I think this Court has recognized in many

19

cases that this very conduct, an abusive deprivation, is

20

at the heart of the due process clause.

21

which was the target of the Fourteenth Amendment, and as

22

Screws did hold though, yes, that was a life deprivation

QUESTION*

I guess the Court held in Ingraham

2

v. Wright that state court remedies were an adequate

3

process for students subjected to corporal punishment in

4

school, and that of course is even a liberty interest,

5

not even a property interest.

6

are talking about more significant than that?

7

MS. WYATT;

How is the interest you

Justice O'Connor, I think that is

8

a very important question because I read Ingraham a

9

little bit differently.

I do not read Ingraham as

10

saying that state court remedies are going to be always

11

sufficient and, of course, Ingraham clearly does not

12

address substantive due process.

13

Ingraham was one of these challenges to higher

15

assistant principal and at one point I believe even the

16

school board though they got dismissed before they

17

reached this Court.

19

They were the defendants, not the

That is a case, therefore, where the Court

20

looked at the risk of abuse and said, "We've got state

21

remedies that are a deterrent.

22

We've got a number of ether reasons that the risk cf

23

abuse is very small and, therefore, the procedure

24

satisfies due process —

25

QUESTION;

We've got openness.

Well, might that not be true here,

too, for a deprivation of property with state remedies

2

that could be considered adequate?
MS. WYATT:

3

I think it would be if we were

challenging the prison that allowed it.

I think the

5

prison could say, MWe had no idea that this guard was

abusive.

that is not this --

QUESTION*

This was random, and the procedures we've

administered the punishment were a defendant?
MS. WYATT:

12

But

I think it absolutely would have

and should have been.

I think at that case we might

14

have been talking about something more substantive.

15

That teacher who had done the spanking to a hematoma

16

might be held accountable in a way that somebody who had

17

adopted the policy would not be.
That is exactly the distinction that I think

is very important in this case and that has been missed
