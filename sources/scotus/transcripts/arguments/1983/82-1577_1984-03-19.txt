SCOYILLE:

The Californi a bargaining Act,

5

which is the one that is analogous to the Michigan Act,

6

the one that directly regulates agricu ltural marketing

7

and bargainnng, is not at all like the Michigan Act in

8

the two particulars that I mentioned,

9

farmers are not affected at all.

First, unwilling

Unwi lling farmers are

Furthermore, Your Honor, although there is a

14
15

duty to bargain to impasse under the California

16

bargaining law, the duty to bargain between cooperatives

17

and purchasers is not so draconian as it is under the

18

Michigan Act.

19

and a cooperative do not agree a certain time before the

20

marketing season begins, the purchaser must either

21

submit to compulsory arbitration, in which the price and

other terms and conditions of trade will be fixed for

particular crop.
In those two important respects, the Michigan

2
3

Act is much different from the California Act.
The California pro rate lav. Your Honor, is a

It is very analogous to the

6

federal Act, the Federal Marketing Agreements Act of

1937.

It has nothing to do with cooperatives.

A

10

commodity, and the marketing orders, although approved

11

by a majority of farmers, are also approved by an agency

12

of the state of California, and that is the big

13

difference between the Michigan Act here under attack

14

and the federal law in which federal marketing orders

15

are isssued by the Secretary of Agriculture and the

16

California state Act.

17

QUESTION:

Have you identified any other state

18

agricultural marketing Acts which you feel have the same

19

problems as Michigan's?

20

MR. SCOVILLE;

No, Your Honor.

As we say in

21

our reply brief, none of the other state bargaining Acts

22

impinges on the rights of non-consenting farmers to the

23

extent the Michigan Act does.

24

Minnesota, the Act expressly says that the cooperative

25

may not bargain on behalf of or assess fees against any

That is a distinction of great

2

maanitude between the Minnesota Act and the Michigan

3

Act, because the Michigan Act makes unwilling farmers a

4

part of the cooperative in every important economic

5

r espec t.
I will turn, if I may, to the facts of this

6

controversy, because I think they show the interest of

8

the appellants very clearly.

MACMA

then petitioned the appellee board for

QUESTION;

It directly

Mr. Scoville, I thought their

13

answer to that argument was, it is not the handler, even

14

when you define it broadly, but rather the state of

15

Michigan that has applied the coercion when they talk

16

about that specifically.

17

MR. SCOVILLE;

Your Honor, the Supreme Court

18

of Michigan went further than that.

The Supreme Court

1

said that the federal Act was not designed to create any

20

federal right to join or not join a cooperative.

21

said that the federal Act was designed only to prohibit

22

certain bad acts, certain acts of handler coercion and

23

intimidation, and that Congress was not concerned with

24

the underlying economic right of a farmer to join or not

25

join a cooperative.

It

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

In other words, Congress was concerned only

1
2

that farmers lead tranquil lives, free of coercion,

3

fraud,

4

unconcerned about the basic core economic right of how a

5

farmer may market his or her product, and the

6

legislative history. Your Honor, is replete with

7

discussion and consideration of the economic right to

8

market through a cooperative or market individually, and

9

to limit the scope of the federal Act prohibiting bad

and intimidation, but that Congress somehow was

10

acts, and not give protection to the basic economic

11

right protected in the federal Act really renders the

12

Act negatory.

Elsewhere in the opinion, the Michigan Supreme

7

into a federally unregulated area in restructuring the

arrangements between cooperatives and unwilling

farmers.

The only way to say that is -- the only way to

10

conclude that is to say that the relationship between

11

cooperatives and unwilling farmers is not regulated in

12

the federal Act, and that stems from their basic

definitional mistake in failing to realize that

Mr. Garvey.

ON EEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GARVEY;

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

20

please the Court, let me begin by saying a word about

21

Justice Stevens* concern.

22

the Michigan Act is not preempted by the federal Act in

23

this case because the federal Act only applies to

24

handlers, and Michigan is net a handler.

25

Appellees have contended that

That observation might be more pertinent if

the claim in this case were that Michigan had violated

2

the federal Ret, but that is not the claim. The claim is

3

that the Michigan Act is preempted by the federal Act.

4

For example, Michigan surely could not pass a law

5

consistent with the federal Act forbidding farmers to

6

join cooperatives.

7

purposes of Section 2303(a) and (c).

That would be inconsistent with the

For the same reason, Michigan cannot pass a

8

law requiring farmers to join cooperatives, because in
10

Sections 2303(a) and (c) the right not to join a

11

cooperative is guaranteed in the same language as the

12

right to join a cooperative.
Appellees also raise a number of other points

13
14

about how Michigan's Act doesn't actually require

15

membership in an association, and about how Michigan's

16

Act is somehow not preempted because it involves state

17

action.

The government contends that Michigan's Act is

24

as it requires that unwilling farmers be represented by

The

federal Act says that cooperatives may not control

3

unwilling farmers in their relations with handlers, and

4

may not force unwillinc farmers to join.

QUESTION;

Ur. Garvey, is the federal statute

here kind of a branch of the antitrust laws?
MR. GARVEY;

14

No, it is not.

As I said, one of

15

Congress's concerns in insisting — the basic purpose of

16

the Agricultural Fair Practices Act is to make it easier

17

for farmers to join cooperatives if they wish by

18

protecting them against coercion to keep them out, but a

19

corresponding purpose of the federal Act is to assure

20

that they don't have to join if they don't want to,

21

and —

Does it have anything to do with it?

MR. GARVEY:

I perhaps overstate it.

What I

mean to say is that because the Agricultural Fair

5

Practices Act has a number of purposes that are

6

unrelated to the purposes of the antitrust laws, that

7

the fact that it is also consistent with the antitrust

8

laws doesn't make Parker against Brown decisive.
QUESTION;

9

Well, you say it is not decisive,

10

but does it have some role to play in deciding whether

11

or not the Michigan law is preempted?
MR. GARVEY:

12

Well, let me try and explain it

13

this way.

15

involves state action.

16

inconsistent with federal law.

that are not preempted by the Sherman Act, and those

20

have come to be called state action cases, where the

21

state gets involved in fixing prices, but that is not —

22

To say that this case involves state action only sets up

23

the question about whether what Congress was trying to

24

do is frustrated by what Michigan has done.

25

What the appellees say is,

2

suggest that there are a number of other purposes that

3

underlie it.

4

don't want to pay fees to an association.

5

example might he that in the course of the passage there

6

was considerable concern expressed that if farmers had

7

to join cooperatives, buyers of agricultural products

8

couldn't shop around for quality or price terms that

9

were different from those offered by the cooperative.

For example,

the protection of farmers who
.Another

There was also some sense that competition

10
11

among cooperatives was beneficial to the farmer,

12

competition among cooperatives for farmers' membership,

13

but that if membership in cooperatives were not

14

voluntary,

15

be made on o the merits.

16

the decision about what one to join mightn't

So, because Michigan's Act is inconsistent

17

with those purposes as well as the antitrust theme that

18

underlies the voluntariness requirement, it is preempted

19

by the federal statute even if it might be state action

20

under some Parker against Brown analysis, although I

21

might suggest that it is not.

22

what Michigan's Act does is to authorize private

23

parties, that is to say, farmers and handlers, to set

24

the price in their private dealings at which other

25

farmers may buy and sell their goods.

I was about to say that

21

1

That is quite similar to the private action --

2

the non-signer provision in Louisiana’s statute that

3

this Court held invalid in Stregman Brothers.

4

also quite similar to the California statute which

5

required private parties to set prices in Hidcal

Aluminum.

7

private parties about the price at which people should

8

buy and sell was inconsistent with Section 1 of the

10

So even if state action were relevant, this

11

wouldn't qualify as state action, but as I say, the Ag

12

Fair Practices Act, while consistent with the purposes

13

of the antitrust laws, also has a number of other

14

purposes which are frustrated by the Michigan Act.

15

QUESTION*

Hr. Garvey, what about a state

16

requirement that the farmers even if they haven’t joined

prices that will affect even those who haven't joined?

MR. GARVEY:

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

11
12

MR. WHITE;

Mr. White.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.

13

The issue in this case, generally stated, is

14

whether the Federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act of

15

1967 preempts the Michigan Agricultural Marketing and

16

Bargaining Law of 1972.

17

Section 2305(d) of the federal Act states that

the provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to

19

change or modify existing state law, nor to deny the

20

proper state courts of jurisdiction, clear Congressional

21

intent not to occupy the field of farm bargaining, and

ME. WHITE:

That’s right, Justice Blackmun.

4

It was net in existence, hut I believe that in reading

5

the Congressional intent from that statement, it was

6

that certainly the existing state law or certainly

7

anything that would not be in contravention of it or

8

contrary to it.
QUESTION:

9
10

Why do you think the Congress used

the word "existing" then?
MR. WHITE:

11

I think it looked at the statute

12

certainly that existed, and found nothing in those

13

statutes that was contrary certainly to the statute, or

14

they would have built in their own contradiction.

15

do not read from that further Congressional limitations

16

upon the state to an otherwise act of legislation which

17

was indeed a fulfillment of the overall objectives of

18

the Congress in passing the Agricultural Fair Practices

19

Act.

20

I think the general purposes of both the

21

federal and the state Act are in the end the same.

23

bargaining table with processors.

But I

That

24

The appellants claim that there are

25

essentially three aspects of the Michigan Act which are

\

1

repugnant to the federal Act.

Those are essentially.the

2

concepts of exclusive bargaining representative, duty to

3

bargain, and the fair share fee.

4

the fair share fee.

Let's first talk about

5

They argue that because under the Michigan

6

statute all growers and farmers that are affected by

7

that or come within the purview of the bargaining unit

8

must pay to the sole exclusive bargaining representative

9

a fee,

that this is coercieve of their right not to

10

join.

We do not believe that the payment of a fair

11

share bargining fee as part of a collective bargaining

12

system

13

not to join that organization that may be their sole

14

exclusive bargaining representative.

15

This Court implicitly seemed to recognize in

16

the recent decision that we have handed down within this

17

past month in Minnesota Community College Faculty

18

19

share bargaining fee was not coercive of a person's

associational right, and although T simply —; I do not

in tha t -QUESTION;

5

Mr. White, certainly there is some

6

analogy, I suppose, to the Section 14(b) of the

7

Taft-Hartley Act and the right to work states versus the

8

non-right to work states.

Now, courts in those states

have differed, have they not, as to whether the
10

requirement of payment of any agency shop fee by workers

11

who don't want to join the union is or is not prohibited

12

under

the -ME. WHITEi

13

As I understand what you are

14

talking about there. Justice Rehnquist, is the -- I

15

guess the argument of the Solicitor General that under

16

NLEB versus General Motors, that that somehow indicates

17

that there was a Congressional intent somehow not to

18

reguice anyone to join or not to join when he states

1

that there was — one was the financial equivalent of

20

the other.

21

But I do not think that that analogy is

22

appropriate here, because I think that what we were

23

dealing there with was the interpretation of a federal

24

statute which expressly permitted -- first of all, there

25

was pervasive and comprehensive legislation establishing

a collective bargaining plan for workers in interstate

commerce, and the question

3

was whether or not when Congress indicated in Section 8

4

that they could have a union shop, that they could

5

negotiate -- the union could negotiate the union shop,

8

did that in and of itself preclude the negotiation then

7

of so-called lesser item of agency shop.

w

And what the Court said in essence as I read

own right to work law.

QUESTION:

13

That is up on each indivdiual

Yes, but then certainly the result

14

of that holding is that Section 14(b) does permit states

15

to include within the proscription of a right to work

16

law not only an actual union shop but an agency or

17

agency fee state.

18

there to say — you knew, you are saying in effect you

19

are not forced to join the cooperative. All you have to

20

do is pay the same dues as you would have to if you did

21

join.

Now, I think there is some analogy

22

MR. WHITE:

23

QUESTION:

That’s right.
Well, that’s really why most people

24

don’t want to join the cooperative, isn't it?

just don't want to pay the fee.
MR. WHITE:

3

I think that even -- that may be ,

4

although Justice Stewart pointed out in NLPE v. General

5

Motors that there may be some valid reasons for a person

6

not wanting to join, and he was only talking in the

7

financial sense of them being the equivalent, but it

8

seems to me that this case — or this Court in the

9

Knight case made it clear in the case that the mere

10

payment of a fee to a sole and exclusive bargaining

11

representative is not coercive of the right to not join

12

or not to be a member.
QUESTION:

13
14

Is there a standard fee for being a member?
KR. WHITE:

In my opinion, legally we could,

8

I think this is what we have

Whatever one may think of collective

bargaining in general, the question here is, is there
10

anything in the Federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act

11

that is intended to preempt the states from passing a

12

collective bargaining scheme which entails the concepts

13

of fair share fee, duty to bargain, and having an

exclusive bargaining representative.
We do not find that.

15

Now, the appellants

16

argue that the disclaimer language found at 2304 which

17

is denominated by the Congress as a disclaimer of intent

18

to prohibit normal dealing somehow establishes a federal

1

right on the part of processors not to have to deal with

any, and I think that what the appellants consistently

ignore is the first four words of that disclaimer, which

one purpose of the federal Act was to protect the right

MR. WHITE;

15
16

It was intended to prevent any

improper pressures on behalf of handlers.
QUESTION;

17

Well, yes or no to my question.

18

Was one purpose of the Act as reflected in the

19

legislative history and the language of the Act to

20

protect the right of an individual farmer not to join an

21

agricultural co-op?
MR. WHITE;

to say

Answering yes or no, I would have

that was one of their intentions, yes.
QUESTION;

All right.

Then do we have to look

at the Michigan Act as a whole to determine whether it

provides what amounts to coercion to farmers to join the

co-op?

MR. WHITE;

QUESTION;

5

I think we can -Is that what we really have to

focus on?
MR. WHITE;

6

I don't think that the Michigan

7

Act does that certainly insofar as the requirement to

pay the fair share.

9

QUESTION;

10

that g uestion.
MR. WHITE;

11
12

But you agree we have to answer

I think you do in light of what

the — the plain wording of the -QUESTION;

13

All right, and then in answering

14

the question, don't we have to look at the whole package

15

of what the Michigan Act does to the farmers to

16

determine whether it is coercion, not just break it

17

down,

18

do it?

19

answer whether that amounts to coercion?

20

well, does the fee alone do it, or does this alone
Don't we have to lock at the whole thing and

MR. WHITE;

It seems to me that you have to

21

look as to whether anything in the Michigan Act amounts

22

to handler coercion, and I think that important from our

23

standpoint is the fact —

24
25

QUESTION;

And the co-op is defined as a

handler under the terms of the federal Act.

MR. WHITE:

2

QUESTION;

3

That’s right.
Althouqh the court in Michigan

didn’t acknowledge that in its opinion.

4

ME. WHITE:

With that, I guess I would have to

5

respectfully disagree with the appellants .that the

6

Michigan Supreme Court did not recognize that.

7

example, at A-10 of the jurisdictional statement, there

8

is a statement by the Michigan Supreme Court within

9

their opinion.

For

It says, "While 2303 makes it unlawful

10

for a handler to coerce a producer to join and belong to

11

association, it does not forbid the state from requiring

12

exclusive representation of individual producers where a

13

producer majority sees fit."
Now, the first words of that, where it says,

14
15

"23C3 makes it unlawful for a handler to coerce a

18

producer to join or belong," there was a tacit -- there

17

was a

18

Act included a definition of handler -- they wouldn’t

19

have made that statement, because they can assume the

20

processors weren’t going to coerce them not to join.

21

recognition that they understood that the federal

The other thing is, I disagree with Mr.

22

Scoville's statement that Section 7 is any type of a

23

clear indication that the Michigan Supreme Court did not

24

understand that the federal Act --

25

QUESTION;

You mean Footnote 7?

37

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

MR. WHITE;

Excuse me. Footnote 7 at A-5..

The

2

statement — Footnote 7 reads, "For ease of reference,

3

we use the terra

4

interohangeably in this opinion.

5

germane to our disposition of the issues, there is a

6

technical difference between the two."

8

'handler* and

'processor'
Although in a way not

I think they absolutely — they recognized the
difference between the Michigan and the state Act in
that the federal Act stated that a cooperative was also

10

a handler for the purposes of that Act, but they were

11

saying insofar as our determination is concerned, we do

12

not think that that is determinative of our decision.

13

So I believe that they did recognize the

14

difference.

15

the Supreme Court of the state of Michigan was

16

recognizing is the same thing that Congress recognized

17

in the passage of this Act, and that is the vulnerable

18

position that the individual grower finds himself in

1

dealing with the process.

20

I think that what the state of Michigan --

It seems to me that the appellants' argument,

21

to accept the appellants* argument that this federal Act

22

intended to prevent the states from enacting in effect a

23

collective bargaining model for growers just stands on

24

its head 70 years of Congressional history in doing

25

whatever they could to encourage collective action by

MR. WHITE:

Yes.

I think that 2303(a)

24

protects the farmer against coercion by a handler, which

25

includes -- which under the federal Act includes both

It seems to me that we have years of

This Court certainly was not unaware of the

21

plight of the farmer.

For example, in the National

22

Broilers case, this Court clearly recognized the plight

23

of the individual farmer.

that decision, "Farmers were seen as being caught in the

25

hands of processors and distributors who because of

Now, there again, this isn't determinative.

10

That was a Capper-Volstead case, and the extent to which

11

the Court would permit the extension of the

12

Capper-Volstead protection to cooperatives.

13

throughout this we have recognition by the courts and by

14

Congress of the vulnerability of the farmer, and I

15

understand that the National Foci Processors and

16

American Food Institute very well may not want to deal

17

with cooperatives, but to say this federal Act which was

18

in effect very narrow in scope and was intended to
