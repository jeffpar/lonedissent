Mr. Palmer, you may proceed

whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT CF J. I. PALMER, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF

MR. PALMER:

We'll hear arguments

please

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

the Court:
Louisiana and Mississippi once again disagree

10
11

about the location of cur common boundary in the

12

Mississippi River.

13

with about a four-mile stretch of the river which is

14

situated approximately three and a half miles north of

15

the Natchez, Mississippi, bridge.

In this litigation we're concerned

This case is remarkably similar to the one

16
17

that ycu decided in 1966, that being No.

1U Original, in

18

that,

19

oil well which was drilled in 1972 from the Mississippi

20

side of the river and ycur decision will in large

21

measure determine, among several issues, in which state

22

this oil well is located.

while the facts are similar, we also have here an

23

Mississippi has filed exceptions to the report

24

of the Master in this case and they focused on two basic

25

areas:

the evidence in the case and fashioned his

refusal to draw a specific tcundary by geodetic

in dispute, which is essentially 1972 through

How, as the Master's report correctly

7
8

reflects, Your Honors, Louisiana and Mississippi both

9

recognize that the law cf the thalweg controls here.

10

Your landmark decision of Iowa versus Illinois in

11

announced the basic law of the case, and in

12

you decided Louisiana versus Mississippi in the first

13

instance you told both states that the law of the

14

thalweg controls.

So to that' extent we agree on the law.

15

1892

Cf

16

course, the thalweg principle has two basic predicates,,

17

one being the principles of accretion and avulsion --

18

excuse me, accretion and erosion — and the other being

19

the principles of avulsion.
Now, the Master on page 4 of his report

20
21

suggests to you both in the text and in footnote number

22

one that this Court now is involved only with the

23

principles of accretion and erosion as they would apply

24

to the so-called live thalweg cf the river in this

25

area.

You'll see that the Master asserts in that

QUESTION;

17

Well, that's not inconsistent with

18

the thalweg being live, is it?

19

MR. PALMER;

Your Honor, we say to the Court

20

that the thalweg or the boundary in this case consists

21

in the upper part of the live thalweg and in the lower

22

part of the so-called dead

The state boundary must be continuous, and in

2

Corps of Engineers cutoff.

3

And that's one of the key contentions cf

4

Mississippi here, is that Louisiana not only asserted

5

that the law of avulsion is involved here, tut both

6

states throughout trial introduced ample evidence to

7

shew the location of the old dead thalweg and also hew

8

that has been affected by the westwardly movement cf the

9

river.
I would call your attention, Your Honor, to

10
11

the fact that, in addition to the assertions of both

12

states in the pleadings, the very second exhibit which

13

was introduced at trial, which

14

is a map depicting several features in 1971.

15

surface location of the well on the Mississippi side of

16

the river, the bottom location, and the specific

Palmer, on reading

4

footnote one of the Master's report to which you refer,

5

he says;

6

the location of the Louisiana-Mississippi boundary

7

relative to the bottom hole location of the well must be

8

determined by reference to the live thalweg.”
Now, is that an incorrect statement in your

MR. PALMER;

11

Your Honor, the implication or

concerned about is the location of the boundary with

14

respect to that well, and that we say is the fundamental^

We're concerned about the location of the

Okay.

But is that a correct

19

you do, that with respect tc the location of the oil

21

govern ?

22

MR. PALMER;

Your Honor, a latitude line drawn

23

through the bottom hole location in an east-west

24

direction would intersect that portion of this boundary

25

which is live.

It would not intersect that portion of

the boundary which is part cf the dead thalweg

2

that extent that is a correct statement.

Sc to

The problem we have, Your Honor, is the

4

suggestion of the footnote,

which is consistent with the

Master’s report to you, that all he wants to do is lcok

at that one point on the boundary.

Is there a top hole?

KR. PALMER:

12

Yes, sir, and that top hole is

13

located in the State of Mississippi on the lands of cur

14

Co-Eefendants, the Dille family.

15

drilled deviationally, in an angular fashicn, under the

QUESTION:

What are the concerns other than

the well?

I take it that you say the period that you're

23

concerned with ends in

the period in '82, it would no longer be the boundary

consequences of this case in addition to —
QUESTION;

9

That’s what I’m asking you.

MR. PALMER;

10

— the oil well ownership.

First

11

of all, as we have said, both states have asked that the

12

boundary be drawn, and here are the reasons that we say

13

it’s extremely important here.
First of all, Louisiana through its own

14
15

exhibits in evidence has shown that their recommended

16

boundary falls well to the west of the 1964 dead

17

thalweg.

18

has proved that she has lost land in that time period

19

and Mississippi has gained land in that time period.

20

Therefore, Mississippi has acquired additional lands

21

over which to assess ad valerem taxes, we have

22

additional lands to exert our police jurisdiction ever.

23

New,

that taken to be true, Louisiana herself

Louisiana conversely, having lost some land,

24

has these drilling units, one cf which surrounds this

25

oil well, diminished in scope.

And if we sit here and

let Louisiana continue to claim out to a dead thalweg

2

which she herself proves doesn’t exist any more, you’re

3

talking about giving a state mere land than even she has

4

said she’s entitled to.
QUESTIO»s

5

Well, I know, but setting the

boundary at the end of

MR. PALMER*

let me point out --

QUESTION*

*82 wouldn’t settle your dispute,

It’s not there. Your Honor.

The boundary has moved.

11

knew,

12

how it’s moved since *82?

13

which way has it moved?

MR. PALMER;

But

I don’t

Do you know which way,

I don’t, and that would only be

14

determined through the addition of more testimony.

15

me point out something, though. Your Honor.

16

in his suggestions to you as a basis for net drawing

17

that line used your precedent, the old ICC case back in

18

1311 or thereabouts.

19

QUESTION*

Well,

The Master

I’m still interested in your

20

reasons for wanting the — all of your reasons for

21

wanting the boundary as of

22

that four-mile run.

23

MR. PALMER*

Let

future probably, entertained petitions for the entry of

1

a supplemental decree

2

shows in the future that the boundary has moved

3

radically to the west, then of course Mississippi would

4

come before you and ask for the entry of a supplemental

5

decree.

In the event that the evidence

The case would be reopened, additional facts

8
7

would be presented.

Then you would have another

8

determination as of the date of the conclusion of that

9

supplemental hearing.

How, Your Honor, if we're not

10

going to draw a boundary here, then at that later time

11

we start all over again.
QUESTIONS

12
13

So long as the thalweg is live, you

can't draw a metes and bounds boundary.
HE. EALMERs

14

Your Honor, you can draw the

15

metes and bounds boundary for every year for which you

16

have evidence of its location after —
QUESTIONS

17

18
19

<20

Hell, what's magic about a calendar

year?
ME. PALMER*

It's magic in the sense that

we're determining net only the rights between the

21

states, but you must remember there are private

22

Defendants in this litigation, and to that extent in the

23

lower court, in the action that precipitated this very

24

lawsuit, the Dille family has complained of possible

25

drainage of the oil from their land.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

New, that’s their private concern

1

That’s not

2

the concern of the state.

Put Your Honors, unless they

3

can prove where that boundary is in this tine frame,

4

they cannot make their drainage case.

5

sitting there, if this Court does not draw the boundary,

6

with a pending case before a lower federal court and

7

they’re being folds

Okay, prove your boundary — prove

8

your drainage case.

They can’t prove it.

9

QUESTIONS

So they’re

Well, can’t they get a witness to

10

testify as to which side of the property they’re

11

claiming the thalweg is then running or is running at

12

the relevant date for that case?
NR. PALMERs

13

That is still basically a

14

boundary decision. Your Honor, and Louisiana got this

15

case removed to here because they say this is the only

16

forum

17
18
19

20
21
22
23

for determining that boundary.
QUESTION;

But no one doubts the boundary is

the live thalweg, do they?
ME. PALMER:

It is live at that one point,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Which is the point at which the

Dille family is concerned, I would take it.
MR. PALMER;

Well, that is the one point on

24

their property boundary. Your Honor.

But their boundary

25

is commensurate with the Louisiana boundary for the

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

entirety of their ownership.

So they get one point on

2

their boundary line, but the rest of their boundary is

3

left indeterminate.

4

What I'm suggesting to you basically as tc

5

that question, that if this Court does not draw that

6

boundary and the private Defendants are remanded tc the

7

lower court to prove their drainage case and they can't

8

do it, you have the classic situation like the ICC

9

case.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

HE. PALMER:
and Louisiana said:

14

16

Why

can’t they do it?

13

15

Well, why can't they do it?

Because they attempted to dc that
Nc, you can't do it at the lower

QUESTION:

Louisiana can't keep them from

going into the lower federal court, can they?

17

MR. PALMER:

18

QUESTION:

They did.
Well,

We're here.

I know you're here.

But if

19

we don *t determine the dispute — what if we had turned

20

down jurisdiction?

What if we hadn't permitted

21

Louisiana to file?

What would they — just on the

22

grounds that the only real issue involved was who owned

23

that oil well and that was a private matter,

24

essentially.

25

MR. PALMER:

Which is exactly what we argued

13

That may be, but suppose we had

Well, they certainly could have

gone forward with proof.

8

MR. PALMERs

9

QUESTIONS

Well —

MR. FALKER:

10

Yes, sir.

Of course, this Court had that

11

very same question posed to you in No. 92 Original,

12

Arkansas versus Mississippi, when Arkansas was cn the

13

courthouse doorsteps going to trial and backed up and

14

saids

16

Wait a minute, that’s not the right forum tc
And you entertained their

They did file suit.

17

The Master suggests that if this oil well

18

weren't involved in this suit you wouldn't have let

19

anybody do it.

20

But it's already happened in No. 92.

QUESTION

i

Well, if we reject your exceptions

21

to the Master's report and accept his report, I take it

MR. PALMER;

Your Honor, the only prcbleir —

New, if they will concede to try

10

their boundary case in a lower federal court against a

citizen of another state, okay.

12

that here, so they removed it to this Court.
This is an unusual case in which the state

QUESTIONS

15

There isn’t exclusive jurisdiction,

16

is there, in this Court just because a state is a

17

party?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. PALMER;

No, sir, and we suggested to you

originally not to grant leave for that very reason.
QUESTION;

I understand, I understand that, I

understand that.
MR. PALMER;

Your Honor, we simply say that,

23

since the Court has taken the case, we’ve tried it, the

24

evidence is before the Court, the Master has labored

25

diligently with several thousand words to describe one

15

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

picture, why not just have him put his line on those

2

hydrog raphs?

3

A suggestion has been made by the Master even

4

before today that, as in the last Louisiana case. No.

5

14, that someone should be able to just read the report

6

and determine from his reading where the boundary is.

7

Dnfcrtunately, in that latter case, Your Honors, if

8

you’ll refer to the Master’s report you’ll see there

9

were no hydrcgraphs in that case for any of the years in

10

disput e.
QUESTION:

11

Hell, if the thalweg is migrating,

12

you can't get an accurate description of the boundary

13

from the time it takes the surveyors to go out and see

14

where the thalweg is on January 15th until the time they

15

can come and testify before the Master on February 1st.

16

The boundary may be different between January 15th and

17

Februa ry 1st.
MR. PALMER:

18

Correct.

Your Honor, we are

19

arguing about '72 to

20

saying that there are material consequences of this

21

determination for that time period, regardless of what

22

happens —

23

QUESTION:

*82, net anything after '82.

We’re

Are you suggesting that there was

24

only one metes and bounds description of the boundary

25

between 1972 and 1982?

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

SR. PALMER:

1

We’re suggesting that there is a

2

metes and bounds description for every year for which

3

there is .proof upon which a boundary could be

4

determined.
QUESTION:

5

There may be a metes and bounds

8

description for every week that would vary from week to

7

week.

8

over ten years?

Do you-want the Master to go week by week at it

MR. PALMER:

9

Your Honor/ we have asked that

10

you do what the Master did in No.

14 and simply have him

11

draw it for every year.

12

decree recites the metes and bounds description of the

13

state boundary for about a ten-year period at the end of

14

the case.

That was done there.

Your cwn

15

So to that extent we have the same thing, and

16

yet the Court is being asked tc depart from all of that

17

and to do what you’ve never done before and have a

18

boundary case in which you don't determine a boundary,

19

you just determine one point on it and say, well, this

20

is — Louisiana owns the oil well, forget about it and

21

go home.

22

Now, it would be like in 92 Original, Arkansas

23

versus Mississippi, just telling Arkansas:

Well, you

24

don’t cwn this little piece of land, but we’re not going

25

to drawthe boundary, so forget about it.

QUESTION:

5

Kell, what if the Master, to get

back to that, gave you a metes and bounds description of

7

the dead part cf the thalweg and then, with respect to

8

the part of the boundary that was covered by a live

9

thalweg, simply described what a thalweg is, the deepest

10

point of the channel and so forth, and gave no metes and

11

bounds.

12

Would that satisfy you?
ME. PALMER;

Your Honor, in Nebraska versus

13

Iowa this Court plainly said that when you're talking

14

about a boundary and the law of avulsion, which is what

15

you're talking about with that dead thalweg, that that

16

thalweg remains fixed unless and until the river comes

17

back and reoccupies it.

Okay.

Eut I say if the Master had

20

23

live thalweg from point sc and so, whatever it is,

24

MR. PALMEE;

Your Honor, my point has been

that in the past this Court has not required some major

QUESTION:

You certainly haven’t done it in

But you

think

just because two states want their boundary

about accretion versus avulsion or that, you know, that

that nonetheless the Master is employed simply to plot

MB. KIKHEL

If there’s a legal issue involved

2

in that, I don’t know «hat it is, because the boundary

3

— in my opinion the boundary does not have to connect.

4

Mississippi asserts that the boundary needs to be

5

continuous, but if that were the case then this live

thalweg would have to go all the way up to the beginning

of the state of Mississippi and Louisiana in the river.

We don’t have a continuous boundary with

QUESTION;

Well then, maybe you’re wrong in

thinking that the lower thalweg is dead.
MR. KIKMEL;

No, sir, the lower thalweg is

13

dead as a result of a cutoff.

Honor, and what has happened is the cutoff area dries up

and forms a dead thalweg.

QUESTIONt

3

Well, is that all that Louisiana

prayed for in its complaint?
KB. KIMMEL:

4

Yes, sir.

We asked for a

5

boundary to be determined in that particular area,

8

disputed area.

7

concerning the 1964 thalweg, and the reason we did that

8

was because when we filed the suit we were not sure

9

whether cr not that 1964 dead thalweg would be an issue

We did also include an allegation

10

in the case.

fts it turned cut through discovery and

11

depositions, that particular thalweg was not an issue in

12

the case and the entire case can be disposed of by the

13

determination of a live boundary in the vicinity of the

14

well.

MR. KIMMEL:

Yes, sir.

Because when there's an avulsion,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you're absolutely

2
3

right, if this Court does not draw a boundary you have

4

no more than a quiet title action.
QUESTION;

6

Hell, let me ask you.

If you're

6

connecting, say, the north end of the dead thalweg here

7

with the southern end of the live thalweg in the area in

8

dispute, you say the lines are there, tut connecting

9

those two points would not be in the current live

10

thalwe g ?
MR. PALMER;

11

That's correct, because by

12

definition the terminus of the southern end would be the

13

live thalweg.

14

QUESTION;

Exactly.

15

MR. PALMER;

16

QUESTION;

And it has migrated.

Yes, sir.
And so you have — the boundary

17

line would be traversing a section of the stream that

18

wouldn't be in the live thalweg.
MR. PALMER;

19

That's correct, and that's why,

20

as was testified to at trial, the accepted technique is

21

to draw the perpendicular line through the live
