CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Tower against Glover.
Mr. Frohnmayer, you may proceed whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. FROHNMAYER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FROHNMAYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, the narrow subject

10

presented by this case is whether public defenders are

11

immune from their clients' Section 1983 claims when they

12

are cast as conspiracies.

13

But the broader question directly implicated

14

is whether the Civil Rights Act of 1871 in this Court

15

must countenance conspiracy claims which act to

16

undermine effectively the independence and functioning

17

of the state in judicial processes.

18

This Court has previously recognized the

19

integrity of the judicial system by granting absolute

20

immunity to three of its four vital participants:

21

judges, witnesses, and prosecutors.

22

This case presents an opportunity to close the

23

fourth side cf an iron rectangle of protection for the

24

judicial process by acknowledging the immunity of the

25

public defender.

3

Extension of this protection obviously gees

6

Fourteenth Amendments in Gideon v. Wainwright.

to provide indigent defense counsel in accordance

In urging reversal of the Ninth Circuit, below

7
8

the mere desire for geometric symmetry/ because

we submit four propositions this morning.
First is that public defender immunity from

10

Section 1983 conspiracy claims is, in fact, necessary to

11

protect against destructive suits which themselves

12

threaten the integrity and finality of the judicial

13

process itself.
Second, that public defender immunity is

14
15

necessary to protect the institution of public defender

16

as one of the most effective methods of meeting Sixth

17

Amendment mandates.
Cur third contention and proposition is that

18
1

public defender immunity, in fact, best serves the

20

interests of indigent clients.
And, finally, we submit to the Court that

21
22

there exist alternative remedies for those few abuses

23

which

24

absolute immunity.

25

might exist which amply justify the grant of

The facts giving rise to this case are simple

counsel.

4

his state and county public defenders.
QUESTION:

6

We note simply that respondent Glover, a

You limit your arourcent to public

defenders, not to privately-retained defenders.
ME. FRQHNMAYER:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, the facts

8

of this case, of course, just present the issue of

9

public defender.

Seme cf the policies which we urge and

10

favor,

obviously, would extend to the whole gamit cf

11

counsel, although we dc not argue their case precisely

12

because we believe that the most forceful case for

13

immunity, if immunity is to be granted, does in fact lie

14

with the public defender institution.
QUESTION:

15

Well,

what of the private lawyer

16

who is

17

particular case?

18

counsel and public defender.

19

just appointed tc represent an accused or a
He’s in between the privately-retained

MR. FROHNMAYFR:

Yes.

And the difference,

20

Justice Erennan, is this — and whether the difference

21

would cause any difference in result, of course, is open

22

to question.

23

counsel does have the option as tc whether or net tc

24

accept a particular appointment, whereas those cases

25

which come to the public defender office are ones which

The difference is that the appointed

5

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the public defender has no capacity to refuse.
The intake of that office is fixed; the risks

2

3

may be high; and the public defender has no way of

4

minimizing the risks of a highly litigious group of

5

people .
QUESTION;

6

But, neverthless, do not some of

7

the suggestions you made in your initial summation apply

8

as much to the appointed counsel as they do to the

9

public defender?

10

MB. FPOHNMAYEB;

Yes, they could.

11

We are simply suggesting to the Court that

12

absolute immunity did apply to all counsel at common law

13

with respect to defammation proceedings, and that if one

14

locks at the contemporary policy and the contemporary

15

structure of indigent defense, there is a continuum on

16

which

17

public defender; a slightly less strong case made for

18

the appointed counsel; and perhaps the weakest, but

19

perhaps still an acceptable case, made be made for

20

privately-retained defense counsel.

the strongest case, then, can be made for the

21

That's our position.

22

QUESTION;

On the one point you made,

I’m not

23

sure it’s consistent with history.

The public defender

24

is not drafted for the assignment.

He volunteers, or

25

she volunteers to become a member of the staff of a

6

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

public defender; whereas, certainly, the tradition was

2

that when a court called a private practitioner and

3

asked that private practitioner to appear and defend a

4

person charged, certainly the tradition was that the

5

lawyer should not refuse but should accept.
MR. FROHNMAYERi

6

I think that that is the

7

tradition, Chief Justice Burger, but I think that the

8

common

9

counsel who wish to be appointed some flexibility in

practice in seme jurisdictions, obviously, gives

10

determining whether they wish to be on the list for a

11

particular court or for a particular time.
And with reference to history, there is an

12

13

interesting point which is raised by the Kaus citation

14

on page 28 of the respondent's briefs, the UCLA study of

15

the English practice at common law for at least 200

16

yea rs.
And the import of that common law immunity

17
18

from malpractice actions in criminal defense proceedings

19

for English barristers was, in part, grounded on the

20

fact that the English barrister at common law has rc

21

discretion to refuse a client and does not have the

22

contractual relationship with the client, but must

23

instead take whatever accused criminal walks in the door

24

as his client on behalf of the solicitor who offers the

25

brief

to the barrister.

Sc, in that respect,

1

there is a strong

2

comparison between the policy reasons underlying the

3

English common law immunity from malpractice actions or

4

barristers, and that which obtains most strongly, we

5

believe, in the case of the public defender with respect

6

to immunity that we’re arguing in this case.
QUESTION;

7
8

societies?
ME. FROHNMAYER:

9

QUESTION;

10
11
12

What about private legal aid

With respect to --

Your point.

Like, for example, in

New York.
MR. FROHNMAYER;

Well, in the State of Oregon,

13

the private legal aid society dees not provide for

14

criminal defense.

15

QUESTION;

I’m not talking about — I'm saying

16

what about states other than Oregon that have private

17

public assistance programs for lawyers defending

18

indigent clients?

19

QUESTION;

Would they be immune?

20

MR. FROHNMAYER;

We would submit that many of

21

the common law arguments for immunity and many of the

22

policy arguments for immunity would apply equally to the

23

private legal aid organization, at least to the extent

24

that it could not control its intake.

25

QUESTION;

Well, what makes you think they can

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

control their intake?
ME. FRGHNMAYEB;

2

It may well be that they

3

cannot, and if they cannot —

4

QUESTION;

5

percent of the cases, would they be immune?
MB. FROHNMAYEB;

9

7

Well, if they can, but they take 99

Yes.

Under the reasoning

that we advance, they would be immune.

8

QUESTION;

Why?

9

SB. FBCENMAYEEi

Eecause of the nature of the

10

risk which they accept.

11

population that they have is a client population that

12

they are not, in effect, practically free to refuse,

13

then the same degree of risk affects the operation of

14

their criminal defense activities.
QUESTION;

15
16

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Then I get back to the Chief

J u s ti c e .
What about a private lawyer who gets a $50,000

17
18

If 99 percent of the client

fee?

Is he immune?
MB. FROHNMAYEB;

that we urge, yes.
QUESTION;

Under some of the policies

Under the most -You mean he collects a $50,000 fee,

and he doesn’t have to account for what he does?
QUESTION;

Well,

Mr.

Frohnmayer;

It might

help an awful lot if you got to your very last point now.
You weren't arguing that they're immune from

malpractice suits, are you?
ME. FROHNMAYER;

2

Your Honor, this is a very

3

interesting point because --

10

in the authority cited by respondent on page 28 of its

11

brief,

13

States up until the year 1984.

that there are cnly eight reported criminal

14

And it may very well be that there is --

15

QUESTION;

16

Criminal?

What about just a — how

about just a malpractice suit?
MR. FROHNMAYER;

17

Well, a malpractice suit

18

which arises from the conduct of a criminal defense.

19

There are eight.

20

to 1871.

21

And that is all.

QUESTION;

None of them prior

That may be, but would — you

22

wouldn't say that a private lawyer who earned the fee

23

that Justice Marshall mentioned is immune from a

24

malpractice suit, would you?

25

MR. FROHNMAYER;

Not from a malpractice suit,

but
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, is he different from the

legal aid society or from the public defender?
MB. FRCHNMAYER:

4

He’s different in two

5

respects, Justice White, and these two respects are,

6

first of all, that the client does have an independent

7

contract remedy against the attorney; and, secondly, the

8

client has an economic incentive not tc urge the

9

pressing of frivolous claims on behalf of his case.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well,

we haven't held that the

appointed counsel is net immune from malpractice suits?
MB. FROBNMAYER:

I don't believe that you

13

have.

14

case,

15

Act did not, by itself, import an immunity which would

16

apply in a state malpractice proceeding.

17

If you're referring to the Ferri v.

Ackerman

all this Court held was that the Criminal Justice

It is not, in our judgment, a holding to any

18

degree that the federal common law under 1983 justifies

19

a malpractice action against lawyers, and, in fact,

20

quite the contrary.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I wasn't asking that.

I'm

22

asking whether, in your view, the legal aid clinic or

23

the public defender is immune from a state law

24

malpractice suit, in your view.

25

MR. FROHNMAYER;

That depends on the state.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, how about the great State of

Oregon ?
HE. FROHNKAYER:

3

That issue has never been

4

litigated by the Oregon Supreme Court,

5

recognized, in the case of Watt v. Gur key, which this

6

Court cited in Imbler v. Pachtman, the prosecuto rial

7

immunity exists as in absolute manner, and it may well

8

be that the Oregon Supreme Court would follow that case

HR. FR0HNMAYER:

conspiratorial liability, which is the issue that we

25

have before us.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Frohnmayer, none of our

2

immunity cases, whether judicial immunity, prosecutorial

3

immunity, suggest that there is immunity as a matter of

4

federal law from state actions, do they?

5

MR. FROHNMAYER;

6

law or statutorily based?

7

QUESTION;

8

ME. FRGHNMAYFR:

9
10

From state actions at common

Whichever.
No, there's not, and we're

not contending that's the case.
QUESTION;

So, whether or not the petitioner

11

here would be liable under an Oregon malpractice

12

statute, is something we certainly don't have to decide.

13
14
15

MR. FROHNMAYER;

That's correct, and we have

not suggested to the Ccurt that it need decide that.
QUESTION;

Well, I thought you were kind cf

16

weaving together kind cf malpractice arguments, together

17

with 1983 arguments.

18

MR. FROHNMAYER;

No, no.

I was simply

19

suggesting a continuum of different forms of legal

20

representation.

21

QUESTION;

22

them together, but he refused.

23

QUESTION;

I attempted to get him to weave

General Frohnmayer, isn't the fact

24

that there are so few malpractice actions against public

25

defenders an argument against your position that finding

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

1983 liability would open floodgates of suits?
MR. FROHNMAYEEs

2

I think not.

I think net,

3

for several reasons:

4

this Court’s decisions in Ferri v. Ackerman and Folk

5

County v. Dodson, that any of the lower circuit or

9

district courts in this country believed that there was

7

any question but that the public defender was immure.
Secondly, one has to recognize that with all

8
9

First of all, it was not until

of the other actors in the criminal justice process

10

which convicts a particular defendant possessing

11

immunity, the last and perhaps only target for the

12

person who feels unjustifably dissapointed at his cr her

13

conviction will look tc the public defender as a way of

14

reopening the validity of the entire criminal justice

15

process that convicted that person.
And so in that -- and beyond that poin t, I

16

I belie ve tha t

17

think there's quite a diffe rence, and

18

Tu rner study that we cited in our brief would at lea

19

partially bear this out.
There is a difference in the mind of many

20
21

persons who are incarcerated, between the availability

22

of a federal remedy and the availability of a state

23

remedy .

MR. FROHNMAYER:

If I may submit this,

Justice

13

Marshall, under this Court's holding in Polk County v.

14

Dodson, the fact that a statute authorizes the operation

15

of the public defender was net sufficient, in this

16

Court's judgment in that case, to add the color of law

17

requirement for 1983 jurisdiction.

18

It was -- and the only reason that this case

19

is different than this Court's holding in Polk County v.

Dodson is the additional allegation of a conspiracy

The only possible distinction between the

Dennis case and this one is that in the Dennis case, it

was the immune state official himself who took the

bribe or be subject to undue influence and change his

decision; whereas in this case, it might be argued that

24

the public defender who is not acting under color of

MR. EDWARDS:

I understand that. Your Honor,

2

but to the extent that a public defender performs in the

3

interest of the public in providing efficient and

4

economic assistance to indigent accused, we should net

5

take that liability away.

6

I think that it would be the, perhaps, the

7

Congress which should, or the state legislatures which

8

should provide additional funding for the provision of

9

indigent defense services;

that it's up to the

10

legislature to fund these principles which this Court

11

believes are very important, and obviously this Court

12

believes that effective assistance to indigent accused

13

is important.

14

Amicus professional criminal lawyers’ defense

15

associations, both state and national, who have joined

16

us in saying there should be no immunity for the public

17

defender, both understand and both have advanced the

18

argument that a finding of immunity does nothing at all

19

to advance the effective representation of accused.

20

It’s also clear that the common law immunity,

21

which under — common law immunity from defammation —

22

was also advanced to see that attorneys did not fear

23

subsequent litigation in the defense attorney’s role in

24

judicial proceedings.

25

Again, this was to make sure that all the

2

could get to the truth of the matter.

3

To the extent that we're asked at this point

4

to advance a policy from 1983 liability to — to the

5

extent that we're asked to see that immunity from 1983

6

claims should lie, we’re not asked to accept that

7

because that policy advances the truth.

8

we're asked to do that is based upon the fact that there

9

is a more efficient expenditure of state resources.

The only thing

And

10

that’s why, I think, that the legislature would be the

11

proper authority to see that there are sufficient funds

12

to protect constitutional rights and tc provide

13

effective assistance tc the accused.

14

I would also point out that, although there is

15

a speculative burden that the courts may be -- there is

16

a speculative overburden argument.

17

In addition to that, police officers, who are the most

18

likely target of 1983 litigation, members of the

19

Executive Branch, are only afforded a qualified

20

immunity, not an absolute immunity.

21

It is speculative.

We're asked tc provide an absolute immunity

22

for the -- this Court's been asked tc provide absolute

23

immunity, based on the fact that there will be an

24

overburdening of the courts and an overburdening of the

QUESTION;

3

To what extent do you think the

4

availability of attorneys* fees to a successful

5

plaintiff under 1983 is an incentive to use that as a

6

cause cf action?
MR. FROHNMAYERi

7

To use Section 198 -- I think

8

that still hangs in the balance, Justice O’Connor.

0

not clear even now how much success a plaintiff has to

10

enjcy

11

attcrneys*fees are awarded, even in light of last

12

court’s decisions.

13

It’s

in a Section 1988 — 83 action before

It certainly is seme incentive, but bear in

14

mind that counsel can be appointed in habeas corpus

15

proceedings, and counsel can be appointed in state

16

post-conviction proceedings, whereby these issues can be

17

dealt with in a logical manner without involving , ab

18

initio, the state — the federal court jurisdiction

10

under Section 1983.

20

We submit also that when learned counsel for

21

the respondent says that the public defender has no

22

obligation to urge the frivolous, that the obvious

23

retert is, yes, but he doesn’t have any obligation net

24

to he sued either.

25

And here, the public defenders are asked for

1

$10 million and the State cf Oregon must provide their

2

defense, probably beyond a summary judgment proceeding,

3

and the cost can be catastrophic; catastrophic, not

4

merely fcr the system because it diverts from a fixed

5

class cf indigent defendants whose defense will no

6

longer be adequately prepared because cf the loss cf

7

that person from an office, but it will cause advocates

8

to make a paper trail, a stream of consciousness paper

9

trail about every trial tacticle decision; it will fcrce

10

them to explain why every piece of the brief ended up on

11

the cutting room fleer instead cf before the court.
That’s not the kind cf advocacy which this

12

13

Court’s decisions have encouraged, and that’s not what

14

is in

the interest cf the public.

15

Thank you.
