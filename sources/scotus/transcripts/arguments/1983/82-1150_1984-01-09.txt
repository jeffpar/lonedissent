MR. MERRILL;

It is sometimes not pleasant to

past,

When those two rights are juxtaposed, it is

14

clear that the First Amendment interests of the

15

petitioners must override, absent a compelling

16

governmental necessity for giving sway to the union's

18

QUESTION:

hr. Merrill, are you saying that

19

any time the individual says something that is done to

20

him violates the First Amendment and the person who is

21

violating the First Amendment or alleged to is

22

interested primarily in the financial outcome, that that

automatically decides the case?

24
25

MR. MERRILL;
that assertion.

Justice Rehnguist, I do not make

We do assert, consistent with Abocd,

that when a union obtaining money under the force of

2

federal statute uses that money in a way that would

3

otherwise impinge upon associationa1 or expression

4

rights, that that must be -- must upheld — that use

5

must meet constitutional standards of the First

6

Amendm ent.
Interpretincr the statutory scheme here, the

7

8

Railway Labor Act, must be done from the standpoint of

9

viewing it with strict scrutiny. We must ascertain what

10

Congress sought to accomplish in passing this statute.

11

We have dependable guidance in making that journey in

12

the decisions of this Court, in the Street case, in the

13

Allen case, and in Abood.
In the latter case, this Court has ruled that

14
15

the First Amendment sweeps broadly in a context of

10

compulsory dues litigation, that it extends to encompass

17

social interests, economic and philosophical interests,

18

literary interests, and, of course, political and

19

ideological interests of employees.
As noted, there must be a compelling

20
21

justification to intrude upon those rights and those

22

interests.

23

Amendment principles, the means selected by Congress to

24

accomplish the governmental purpose must impose the

25

minimum burden on plaintiff's constitutional freedoms.

In addition, using established First

Now, the specific Congressional purpose

1

2

authorized and not commanded in the 1951 amendments to

3

this statute was that of obtaining payment for specific

4

services.

5

in a specific collective bargaining context for the acts

6

of the

7

services in administering that contract, and in handling

8

and prosecuting grievances of employees arising under

9

that contract.

negotiating agent, and for its

Again, we have many decisions of this Court

10
11

which make it plain that the procedure used tc protect

12

the union’s interests in this case, that of obtaining

13

money from the plaintiffs, must be drawn in such a

14

fashion so as not to sacrifice the overriding

15

constitutional interests of the petitioners.
As the Court analyzes this case, it is of

16
17

extreme importance to remember that the union wears two

18

hats.

19

to the occurrence of the statute giving rise to this

20

controversy, is that of a voluntary fraternal

24

political activity.

25

The first of these hats, which existed long prior

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

chooses to do, and we note that this Court recognized in

2

Street that unions are inherently ideological and

3

political organizations. Surely no one would argue that

4

a private citizen can be compelled, consistent with the

5

exercise of his First Amendment rights, that one must

6

support the activities of a fraternal organization in

7

that light.
Sc, we turn then to the second hat warn by

8
9

BEAC, and it is wearing that hat when it sought the

10

Congressional purpose, the Congressional permission to

11

obtain money from dissenting employees.

12

collective bargaining representative hat, and when the

13

unions went to Congress in

14

compel the payment of dues, they stressed that they ware

15

required to perform duties with respect to dissenting

16

employees.

It is the

1950 seeking permission tc

They already enjoyed excellent success in

17
18

generating voluntary membership support.

As the Ccurt

19

noted from the legislative history, voluntary membership

20

levels of 75 to 80 percent were commonplace by the late

21

1940*s.

22

that they were required to provide the duty of fair

23

representation to those who chose not to support the

24

unions, who disagreed with

25

not to be a part of these organizations.

Nevertheless, the unions stated to Congress

thair policies, who wished

On the limited basis that those functions had

1

2

by law to be performed, Congress was persuaded to

3

authorize compulsory payment for those services only.
QUESTIONS

4

5

Weren't there closed shops in the

railway industry before the early fifties?
NR. HEBRILLs

6

There were not, Your Honor.

In

7

the 19 34 Act, no form of union security was permitted,

8

so it was strictly voluntary unionism from 1934 until

9

195 1.
QUESTIONS

10
11

Sc this Act didn’t follow the same

path as the National Labor Relations Act.
NR. HEBRILLs

12

That is correct, and I miaht

13

point

14

compulsory unionism to be essential to their wellbeing,

15

because at the time of the 1934 statute, only one such

16

organization had compulsory membership provisions in it

17

out that the railway unions had never found

So, we see that the collective bargaining

18

representative hat is that which Congress addressed in

19

the statute, and it is a confusion of those two roles

20

that 3RAC urges upon this Court and successfully urged

21

upon the Ninth Circuit.

22

I point out that not only did BRAC provide a

23

limited statutory role with respect to petitioners, it

24

did so grudgingly,

25

collective bargaining.

treating them as objectives of
Petitioners were not entitled

1

under this union’s constitution and practices to attend

2

meetings, to vote for officers, to serve as grievance

3

representatives, to vote for grievance representatives.

4

Even with respect to the fraternal activities, which

5

this union seeks to compel payment for, petitioners were

6

excluded.

7

Agency fee payers did not receive union

8

publications.

They were expressly made inelligible for

9

death benefit fund participation.

Only at a later time,

10

when it became apparent that the union might not be able

11

to continue collecting for these functions, after

12

plaintiff's motion for summary judgment had been filed,

13

did this union generously say, oh, well, we meant to

14

make these benefits available t-o all.

15

So, we see that petitioners were treated in a

16

very limited sense by BRAC, just as they were viewed by

17

Congress in a very limited sense.

18

The Ninth Circuit majority decision has

19

interpreted this statute from the perspective of a

20

financially acquisitive union, not from the perspective

21

of Congress, and not from the perspective that this

22

Court described in the Street case.

23

the statute as did the Ninth Circuit majority. Congress’

24

objective was to maximize union power in general, and to

25

legitimize charges for any union fraternal activity

2

function of the union in the realm of collective

bargaining.
QUESTION:

4
5

That is really not the test they

stated, is it, any conceivable, arguable relationship?
MR. MERRILL:

6

Their test is stated that it is

7

anything that is done by the -- the work of the union

8

that is germane to the realm of collective bargaining,

9

test we have not seen in any other case before or

10

since.

QUESTION:

than the one you just stated.

13

But it is quite a different test

MR. kERR ILL:

In practice. Your Honor, I

14

believe that it is exactly the test that I stated.

15

one locks closely at the range of activities supported

18

through the compulsory fee by BRAC, one finds no limits

17

other than partisan political activity.

19

modified by the Ninth Circuit majority.

If one is to take this expansive statutory

21

interpretation, it assures us that we will run roughshod

constitutionality of the statute.

I am prepared to agree.

Well,

I know.

We left it open.

Well, certainly the issues

before the Court are presented on the appropriate record

19

for the first time today.

20

Congress did not enact a statute to favor unions ever

QUESTION;

3

Hr. Merrill, are you going to

4

address yourself to the so-called Paragraph 22 items one

5

by one at some point during your oral argument?
MR. MERRILL;

6

Time does not permit me to

address them individually.

to any questions.

I will be happy to respond

an extraneous federal statute which does require the

2

election of officers.
QUESTION;

3

Part of your response to Justice

4

White suggests to me that you view our previous cases in

5

the Railway labor Act as saying that the union has to

6

justify any charges it makes to your members, rather

7

than saying that your members must make some sort of a

8

showing to avoid paying what is otherwise the normal

9

agency

fee.
NR. MERRILL;

10

I believe that I agree with the

11

gist of Justice Rehnguist’s remarks.

12

remains that dissenting employees voice an objection to

13

the payment of compulsory dues and fees, and they did in

14

this case.

15

written objection to the use of any dues and fees, but

16

particularly for anythina other than direct collective

17

bargaining expenses with Western Airlines.

The requirement

Each petitioner registered a specific

QUESTION;

What about social activities?

Now,

19

I can see your point that they probably have virtually

20

nothing to do with collective bargaining activities, but

21

I can’t for the life of me think why they involve any

22

First Amendment considerations either,

23

there the question is pretty clear.

24

the burden of the argument, so to speak.

25

NR. MERRILL;

so it seems tc me

On whom do you put

encompass union social activities. It is the functioning

3

of a f raternal —
QUESTION*

4
5

recognized that the First Amendment freedoms

In Abocd, how did it recognize

that?
MR. MERRILL*

6

It recognized that when it

7

listed — when it rejected the union argument that only

8

political and ideological activities of the union were

9

safeguarded by the First Amendment, and the Court said,

10

we have never held that the First Amendment does not

11

also cover social, literary, artistic, philosophical,

12

and religious activity.
QUESTIONS

13

Well, you think the Court in Abcod

14

meant that the First Amendment covers a dance in the

15

union hall?
MR. MERRILL:

16

I certainly do.

To the extent

17

that the statute authorizes this union to establish a

18

fraternal organization which undertakes activities of a

19

fellowship nature and a direct association of persons

20

which

21

think that the First Amendment certainly does encompass

22

that type of activity.

23

is not favored, which is opposed by petitioners,

QUESTION:

Just how would you go about

24

connecting up the First Amendment with what you say are

25

your clients* rights here?

I

ME. MERRILL:

1

I would do that by saying, as

2

the Court did in Street, when it placed a strained

3

construction, according to one Justice, upon the

4

statute, and it said only those duties under the Pailway

5

6

duty of an exclusive bargaining representative to hold

7

the dance —
QUESTION:

9

Act can be the subject of charges.

Okay.

There is no

That is a permissible

argument from the point of view that Congress intended

10

only very narrow things to be permissible under the

11

agency fee, but you are saying that there is a First

12

Amendment argument in support of that exemption, that

13

somehow your clients* First Amendment rights are

14

impinged on when they are required to put a part of

15

their agency fee to support a band at a union hall

16

dance,

17

we have ever decided supports that proposition.

18

and I can't for the life of me see how any case

MR. MERRILL;

I believe that the antecedents

19

of that proposition are present in Abood when it said

20

that there must be a governmental necessity for the

21

extraction of the fees.

22

QUESTION:

That isn't necessarily a

23

constitutional argument.

You could win your case

24

without even mentioning the Constitution.

25

logically you could.

I mean,

It would be a question of

15

1

statutory interpretation

2

KB. MERRILL*

3

QUESTION*

That is true.

You could say that in order to

4

justify any fee, you must show — somebody must shew

5

that Congress anticipated that the non-union employees

6

could be charged this much to cover these things.

7

MR. MERRILL*

8

QUESTION*

9

That is correct.

And it wouldn’t have to be anything

to do with the Constitution .
MR. MERRILL*

10

We can win the case, but we

11

cannoit obtain the appropriate remedy, because the use

12

of these dissenters’ fees has been expended on

13

activities of the union which violate their First

14

Amendment rights, so the remedy cannot —
QUESTION*

15

Does it violate their rights in the

16

sense that they pay for it but they are not permitted to

17

take part?

Is that your thesis?
MR. MERRILL:

18

It is not.

That is not my

19

thesis.

It is incidental that they were excluded from

20

those things.

21

support them under any circumstances.

It is that they may not be forced to

QUESTION*

22

What if the statute didn’t

23

contemplate your clients being charged for these kinds

24

of things?

25

union extracts from them something that the statute does

Why couldn’t they have a remedy for it?

Now, what is -- why do you need the help

2

of the First Amendment?
MR. MERRILL*

3

Because the use by the union

4

inflicts more than a monetary injury.

5

intangible injury to constitutional rights which cannot

6

be unspent, if the Court will.

If the union extracts —

MR. MEHRILLs

That is correct.

The case is to be remanded to

of the issues that those holdings leave open.

Thus, what has been established to the

objecting employee's or petitioner's benefit to this

8

point by the cases decided by this Court is that on

16

Now, to this point, the Court has not stated

what is encompassed in the area germane to collective

responding to your question, we believe first of all

that the statute contemplates at least normal union

MR. GOLD:

2

On the other hand, we do know again from the

death benefits directly with the employer, and that

Congress indicated an intent to include death benefits.

QUESTIONS

10

11

Well, certainly not by any very

clear language, Kr . Gold.
FR. GOLD;

Justice O'Connor, in those terms,

12.

the language is extraordinarily clear, because it

13

requires the payment of dues by everyone, whether or not

14

they are a member, and it was against a background where

15

Congress was very fully advised of how unions were going

16

to use that money.

Sc, if this were not a case which arises

18

against the background it does, and the only issue this

morning was who wins under the clear language, I think

20

we would be in a very strong position, but we do see

21

this case as one where the indications are that Congress

22

intended to include death benefits, and that there is

23

sound reason for believing that the provision of death

24

benefits is part of the union's activity in dealing with

25

the wages, hours,

and terms and conditions of employment

MR. GOLD;

21

I would think that is not germane

to collective bargaining.

22

QUESTION;

Yes.

So it is just not politics.

MR. GOLD;

Well, it is — we know that it is

politics, and we know that it is ideological activity

25

unrelated.

We are not contesting that.

from that, what we are arguing is that the test is

germane to collective bargaining, and not everything

unions do are germane to collective bargaining.
QUESTION:

For example, Mr. Gold, I take it

the purchase of an automobile with a local’s funds for

MR. GOLD:

Suppose it was a Rolls Royce.
I — One of the issues before

Congress by — created by the opponents was that there

10

ought to be a system of limiting union expenditures

After all, unions have to go and get dues from

MR. GOLD:

I am forced to say that under the

20

statute he loses, and that he doesn't have any possible

21

constitutional argument.

22

in that regard —

Oh, yes, there's Title 5 of the

Landrum-Griffin Act, which provides that anion officers

So he would be a fiduciary in the

NR. GOLD*

7

Congress didn't write the statute

8

to give people who choose not to be members that cause

9

of action, but the cause of action is there if Justice

10

Brennan's example is changed in one respect, that the

11

union dees it over the objection of one union member.

Congress has provided a cause of action.

Congress could

money to a political party?

Yes.

QUESTION*

Why wouldn't they have precisely

the same cause of action for wasting union funds?
HR. GOLD*

21

They could in theory, and Congress

22

could

provide it to them, but my argument, Justice

23

Stevens, is that the statute doesn't give it to them,

24

and Congress is not constitutionally compelled to give

25

it to them.

Congress to this point has given two

HR. GOLD;

3

I am not positive what is true

here,

but most union publications either do not accept

5

advertisements or have a rule like Layman versus Shaker

6

Heights, and they don't take ideological advertisements,

one or the other.
In whatever time remains to me, I do want to

stress the point that what Congress was doing in

adopting the union shop was not, as Hr. Kerrill says,

11

providing a system whereby the unions would provide a

12

certain narrow service and then bill people in the union •

14

the legislative history shows that Congress understood

15

that the free rider problem was the refusal of objecting

QUESTION:

MR. GOLD:

It has to be inexact, because one

union cannot simply take the money and use it.

The District Court — In other words, the

District Court ruled that insofar as we had provided an

internal system for segregating, allocating, and

had met our obligations, and then added this additional

that part of the District Court's opinion, and we told

the Court of Appeals we didn’t think that was in the

We didn’t appeal from that.

ER. MERRILL:

Hay it please the Court, I would

when it is stated that it is abundantly clear that

2

Congress did not abandon the policy of full freedom of

choice embodied in the 1934 Act, but rather made inroads

on it for the limited purpose of eliminating the

problems caused by the free rider.

How, it is without question, we submit, that
