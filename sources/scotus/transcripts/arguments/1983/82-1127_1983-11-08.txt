ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. WHALEN:

please the Court:
As in the cases we heard this morning this

case involves in personam jurisdiction over my client

Helicol.

3

sense.

4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Helicol is a foreign corporation in the true

It is a company organized existing in the

5

country of Colombia, and its sole business is the

6

transportation of persons principally in South America.

7

The jurisdictional issue in this case arises in the

8

context of a wrongful death action which was brought in

9

the State Court of Texas by the family of Dean Hall and

20

several other families who were killed in an accident

2

that occurred in Peru.

22

Helicol had entered into a contract with

23

American construction companies known as

24

Williams-Sedco-Horn, and this contract was executed in

25

Peru and it was designed to be performed in Peru.

In

1

the course of this helicopter operation it was necessary

2

for the operation of the contract that

3

Williams-Sedco-Horn had with the government of Peru, and

4

they were building a pipeline from the jungles of Peru

5

to th? Pacific Ocean.
They needed Helicol to transport workers from

6

7

construction sites to base terminals in Peru.

On the

8

course of one of these trips an accident occurred in

9

which the Respondents* decedents were killed along with

10

two other passengers who are not involved in this law

11

suit or this case.
The case was brought in the state court of

12
13

Texas.

14

State of Texas was established in the course of the

15

hearing on a preliminary motion on jurisdiction was the

16

fact that Helicol had a single contract discussion with

17

the personnel of Williams-Eedco-Horn in Houston, Texas,

18

and also in the course of five or six years prior to

19

that contract they purchased equipment fro® an American

20

manufacturer, Bell Helicopter Company.

MR. WHALEN;

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Do you not regard both of those as

contacts with Texas on the part of your client?
MR. WHALEN;

Yes, Your Honor.

They certainly

are contacts, but the idea of purchases being a basis
for general jurisdiction, that is, this is a case in

21

which the cause of action did not arise out of the
22
purchase of that helicopter.

Even looking at it from the point of view of

the purchase itself without looking at it from the point

of view of the verdict of the jury which found that Ball

2

was not at all negligent in the manufacture of the

3

helicopter, the cause of action in this case as the jury

4

found solely was based upon

5

in Peru.

6

the negligence of our pilot

There were no contacts of the Defendant

7

Helicol in Texas which in any way was connected or arose

out or created the cause of action in Peru.

9

QUESTION*

Unless we regard the training in

10

Texas and the purchase of the helicopter there as

11

bearing on that.

12

MR. WHALEN*

Well, Your Honor, I would suggest

13

that there was no connection and would also suggest that

14

the Supreme Court of Texas among other things ruled that

15

there was no connection between the cause of action and

16

the contacts in Texas, and this is the position which I

17

do not believe my adversary contests.

18

What we are dealing here if Your Honor please

19

is not a case of contacts in a jurisdiction which gave

20

rise to a cause of action.

21

here is a case of what is known as general

22

jurisdiction.

1

which under the Perkins case I believe would give a

2

basis for jurisdiction against Helicol with respect to

3

any cause of action.

4

Supreme Court decided this case.
QUESTION!

5

That is the basis upon which the

Mr. Whalen, I suppose if the facts

6

were exactly the way they were except that the accident

7

had taken place while they were flying over Texas there

8

would be no question they had jurisdiction to sue

9

Helicol for that particular accident.
MR. WHALENs

10

There is no question that Helicol

11

under the ruling of this Court, International Shoe,

12

would be subject to the jurisdiction of the court

13

because the pilot error and negligence as well as the

14

resulting injury occurred in Texas and that there were

15

other minimum contacts as well, the contract discussion,

16

for example, and perhaps in those cases in those

17

instances the purchases of equipment could be a basis of

18

additional minimal contacts to support —
QUESTION;

19

Would there be any difference if

20

there were an adequate showing that the training itself

21

caused the accident?

22

and that was proved.
MR. WHALEN;

23
24
25

I mean, if he was poorly trained

No, Your Honor, I would suggest

not .
QUESTION;

Would that make a difference?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

MS. WHALEN*

It would make no difference

2

because the cause of action arose in Peru.

3

have arisen in Texas.

4

QUESTIONj

It would not

Suppose he was trained if he turns

5

to the left he should boot it to the right, and

6

what wrecked the plane and everybody in the world agrees

7

that that was wrong.

MR. WHALEN;

that is

Well, his —
And he was taught that in Texas.
Well, if he was —
It is your position that that has

nothing to do with it.
ME. WHALES;

If he was improperly taught by

14

Bell Helicopter then, of course. Bell helicopter stands

15

to be liable.

18

taught, in Texas in Peru then that negligence and the

17

conduct or the result of that negligence would all have

18

occurred in Peru.

19

If he violated his teaching, what he was

There is no connection I think under Your

20

Honor's example if you please that there is no

21

connection under your example between the faulty

22

training and the accident in Peru.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Whalen, if the suit had been

24

brought in Peru could Bell Helicopter and

25

Williams-Sedco-Horn have been sued in Peru —

MR. WHALENi

2

QUESTION*

3

SR. WHALENs

4

As a matter of fact we raise this question --

5

We introduced our special appearance which procedurally

6

is the way in Texas we raised a jurisdictional

7

objection.

8

after the accident so if there was a jurisdictional

9

problem then, of course, a protective suit would be

Yes, Your Honor.
It had jurisdiction in your view?
Yes, Your Honor.

We raised it approximately eight months

10

filed in Colombia or in Peru in the event jurisdiction

11

as we believe should not be found in Texas on this

12

course of action.
After the jury returned its verdict we had to

13
14

continue after the jury returned its verdict and we

15

appealed solely on the jurisdictional issue.

16

went to the intermediate Court of Appeals where it

17

reversed the decision of the trial court that the court

18

had in

19

The case

personam jurisdiction over Helicol.
The other side then appealed to the Supreme

20

Court of Texas and the Supreme Court of Texas initially

21

affirmed the decision of its intermediate Court of

22

Appeals, but my adversary then filed a petition for

23

rehearing and the Supreme Court of Texas reversed.

24

is our position that the contacts or the issue in this

25

case is one of solely general jurisdiction that the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

It

1

contacts that Kelicol had in Texas were insufficient to

2

form a basis for general jurisdiction.

3

As the United States government --

4

QUESTION;

Yr. Whalen, do you rely at all on

5

the contract provision that provides for jurisdiction of

6

disputes in Peru?

7

MR. WHALEN;

No, Your Honor, I do not.

I

8

would interpret that provision as determining the rights

9

of the parties to that contract which in that case would

10

be Silliams-Sedco-Horn and Helicol.

11

that decision but it does indicate the intention of the

12

parties particularly Helicol to remove any basis for

13

jurisdiction by any United States court.

14

Their opertaion --

15

QUESTION;

I do not rely on

Well, if the contract provision

18

means what it says and if you were to rely on it I

17

suppose the contract was entered into in a sense in

18

Texas and that might give Texas jurisdiction.

19

NR. WHALEN;

If I may, Your Honor, the

20

contract was not entered into in Texas.

There were

21

contract discussions and the cause of action, the

22

negligence cause of action,

23

before the Court did not arise out of that contract.

24

arose simply out of the negligence on the part of the

25

pilot of Helicol.

to the Respondents who are

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It

1

So again T suggest to the Court that there is

2

no basis for finding that the cause of action in

3

case arose out of that contrtact.
QUESTION;

4

this

So you would like to forget all

5

about the contract provision at least for purposes of

6

this argument in this case?
MB. WHALEN;

7

Yes, Your Honor, for the purposes

8

of the jurisdiction of these Plaintiffs against this

9

Defendant on the Plaintiffs* cause of action.
If the position that the Supreme Court of

10
11

Texas is to be upheld that the purchases of $4 million

12

worth of equipment from an American vendor which is the

13

principle contact which the Supreme Court of Texas

14

relied on for general jurisdiction then it would appear

15

that any time a foreign company purchased American

16

products from an American vendor no matter what its

17

extent that if there is a cause of action which is

18

unrelated to those purchases that foreign purchaser

19

could be dragged into American litigation and all the

20

expenses involved in it solely because of the purchaes

21

of American products.
As the United States government in this case

22
23

succinctly but pointedly established this would as a

24

policy matter be against the export policy of the United

25

States.

In the decisions of this Court certain policy

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

matters have entered into the decisions as to whether

2

there should be or should not he jurisdiction.

3

One of the policy matters in some of the cases

4

has been the residence of the Flaiatiff.

5

out in this case that none of the Respondents were

6

residents of Texas.

T should point

So we have in this case Plaintiffs who are

7
8

nonresidents of Texas suing a commpany which is not

9

based in Texas on a cause of action which occurred in

10

Peru, and as the Supreme Court and the Respondents

11

acknowledge there is no connection between the contacts

12

of HeLicol in Texas and the ultimate cause of action

13

which was brought against Helicol in the State of

14

Texas.

15

The decisions of this Court from International

18

Shoe through Volkswagen have emphasized that there must

17

be a relationship between the parties, the litigation

18

and the forum if jurisdiction is to be established over

19

a nonresident who is not based in the forum state.

20

this rase I suggest to Your Honors that Helicol in no

21

way was based in Texas, and lacking that finding which

22

the Supreme Court of Texas acknowledged there can be no

23

basis for in personam jurisdiction over Helicol on an

24

unrelated cause of action.

25

In

I think this Court respectfully is bound by

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the findings cf the Supreme Court and of the Court of

2

Civil Appeals that the cause of action in this case did

3

not arise out of the contacts cf Helicol in Texas.
QUESTION*

4

Mr. Whalen, are there any

5

circumstaces in which a purchaser or a buyer of goods in

6

the forum state would be sufficient simply because of

7

the quantity purchased, let's say, or the frequency of

8

that occasion to provide general jurisdiction over that

9

buyer?
Yes, Your Honor.

HR. WHALEN;

10

If the business

11

of the company was the buying and selling of helicopter

12

equipment and that the commpany went into Texas to buy

13

equipment for the purpose of reselling it then in that

14

case I

15

equipment would be doing some business under those

16

circumstances.

17

goods for the use of its business in South America its

18

businss is not buying and selling equipment.

19

business is transporting people in South America.

20

would suggest that that company by buying that

But whereas Helicol was buying capital

Its

So the purchase of capital goods I suggest to

21

the Court cannot be the basis for a finding of doing

22

businass, and I belive that this was the gist of Justice

23

Brandeis' decision in the Rosenberg case which I've

24

cited in my brief in which he points out that purchases

25

are not doing business.

That was a case arising in Naw

QUESTION:

alters the relationship of Texas with the buyer though.

4
5

I am not sure that that distinction

MR. WHALEN:

I am sorry, Your Honor.

I do not

understand the question.

6

QUESTION:

Well, if the purpose of the inquiry

7

is to determine the extent of contacts with the State of

8

Texas in this case the forum state for the purpose of

9

inquiring what interest the state of Texas would have

10

and the degree to which Texas, for instance, might want

11

to consider the interests of the buyer I would think it

12

would not make much difference why the buyer planned to

13

buy the goods.
MR. WHALEN:

14

But the cause of action,

Your

15

Honor,

16

with you that that would be a contact on which

17

jurisdiction would be based against Helicol, that is, if

18

Helicol failed to pay for its equipment and Bell wanted

19

to sue Helicol for its failure then I believe that

20

Helicol plus other contacts — Those purchases plus

21

other contacts would form a basis for jurisdiction

22

because the cause of action arose out of those

23

contacts.
I hope I have answered your question, Your

24
25

was based upon that purchase, and I would agree

Honor.

I am not certain I have.

Suppose it was qualified to do

also in business in Peru and on the side it was in the

9

real estate business and it borrowed some money to buy

10

some real estate and did not pay the note.

11

On your facts, Your Honor, yes it

could because I think the first point that —

Could it be

That would not have arisen out of

any of the business they did in Texas.

you said that Helicol was authorized to do business in

18

Texas —

I would interpret —

That is the presence.

1

files with the state and says I want to do business in

2

this state I in effect consent to the general

3

jurisdiction and I recognize that the case that the

4

amicus brief, not the United States, the other brief,

5

has contested this point, but my view is that if a

6

company files with a state asking for authority to do

7

business I believe under one of the older Supreme Court

8

decisions that he has consented to jurisdiction, and I

9

would consider that a consent to be sued on any cause of

action .

MR. FLETCHER;

Xr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Xy clients it is true were not residents of

3
4

the State of Texas.

Their relationship with the State

5

of Texas was purely with Williams-Sedco-Korn which was

6

domiciled in the State of Texas in Houston.
These four men were employed in Texas by

7
8

Williams-Sedco-Horn to work over in Peru.

9

had absolutely nothing to do with any cf the Helicol

10

Xy clients

contacts with the State of Texas.

11

They came into the State of Texas based upon

12

the record in this case, and the discovery was limited

13

to that area cf time from 197C when the helicopter which

14

crashed in Peru was purchased in Texas up until the time

15

of the special appearance motion being heard.

16

came into the State of Texas for far greater reasons

17

than simply to buy some helicopters and some helicopter

18

parts.

18

Helicol

In addition to purchasing the helicopter which

20

crashed this company purchased approximately BO percent

21

of its fleet, and it purchased virtually all of the

22

parts that were necessary to keep that fleet going.

23

They also had pilots who were trained in the State of

24

Texas, and they also had their maintenance personnel who

25

were trained in Texas.

1

They did not stay in Colombia and order

2

helicopters and parts from the State of Texas and then

3

wait for them to be delivered.

4

to Texas and they sent their people from the head man in

5

that company, Mr. Restrepo,

6

president, the head of the maintenance department of

7

that company as well as their pilots and their

8

maintenance personnel.

9

They sent their people

The records in this case will indicate that

10

there were some 33 different business trips taken to the

11

State of Texas by various officials and employees of

12

this company.

13

the Plaintiffs were immediately faced with one

14

fundamental problem and that was where could their

15

rights be determined.

Mow when this incidant occurred in Peru

16

Knowing that this Court has for the last 38

17

years affirmed and reaffirmed the standard of minimum

18

contacts established in International Shoe, the

19

cornerstone of a jurisdiction in personam case must be

20

that there be certain minimum contacts.

QUESTION;

Plaintiffs domiciled in Texas?
KR. PLETCHER;

Ho, Your Honor, not one of

24

them, none of the decedents nor any of their families.

25

The families were from Illinois, two families from

18

1

Oklahoma and ooa family from Arizona.

2

Helicol had absolutely nothing to do with

3

Illinois.

They had nothing

to do with Arizona and had

4

nothing to do with the State of Oklahoma except for one

5

brief overnight stay there on the way to Texas to

6

discuss the contract which has already been mentioned in

7

the opening argument by my adversary.

8

The states of whom my poeple were resident

9

could not hear their case because under this Court's

10

ruling of no contacts, no jurisdiction then those three

11

states could not possibly have passed upon my clients'

12

rig hts.

13

QUESTION*

Even though one of their

14

domiciliaries had been killed as a result of the claimed

15

negligence?

16

HR. FLETCHER*

I think that this Court's

17

decisions have repeatedly reaffirmed, Your Honor, that

18

unless there be minimum contacts then nothing else

19

matters, that it simply —

20

QUESTION*

I suppose in Volkswagen the

21

Plaintiff was clearly resident of Oklahoma, but that was

22

really all that was going --

23
24
25

MR. PLETCHER:

Yes, sir, that is all there was

in Volkswagen.
But without those minimum contacts this Court

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

has held repeatedly there can be no jurisdiction.
QUESTION*

2

Well, your position I take it is

3

that it does not make any difference what kind of a

4

cause of action that is being pressed against the

5

helicopter company as long as it has these minimum

6

contacts in Texas.

7

MR. PLETCHER:

No, Your Honor.

My position is

8

that having once established minimum contacts which has

9

bean done, and I think there is no dispute that there is

10

at least minimum contacts in this case, that then the

11

focus of attention shifts from merely what did the

12

defendant do in the forum state to examining the case

13

from its four corners and particularly in this Court's

14

opinion written by Your Honor in the Volkswagen case and

15

that is where else can the Plaintiffs go to have their

16

cause of action heard.
QUESTION;

17

Well, would you say that — Suppose

18

some United States company sold the helicopter company

19

some gasoline to be delivered in Peru and the helicoptar

20

company did net pay its bills.

21

Texas on that bill just because it has these minimum

22

contacts?

23

Could it be sued in

I would think you would say yes.
MR. PLETCHER*

Yes, sir.

I think that is the

24

single act contact cases that are in both federal and

25

state courts in quite a state of disarray.

QUESTION;

It ships it out of California, but it sues

8

in Texas just because that is where it wants to sue.
MR. FLETCHER;

9

No, sir.

No, sir.

I do not

10

believe then that jurisdiction would be permitted, and I

11

think, that it would

12

QUESTION;

13

not be permitted —
So you think the focal point is

whether they can sue any place else?
MR. FLETCHER;

14

Well, if they could sue any

15

place else, that is, the situation in my case here is

16

that there is no place else in the United States —

17

QUESTION;

Except Peru.

18

MR. PLETCHER;

19

QUESTION;

Except Peru or Colombia.

Mr. Fletcher, you said that there

20

is no issue here of minimum contacts that they

21

conceded?

22

MR. PLETCHER;

I think. Your Honor, that they

23

conceded except insofar as the quality and the quantity

24

and the importance of those- contacts, but that the

25

contacts exist I think is --

Are you asking us to overrule that

MR. PLETCHER;

QUESTION*

23

MR. PLETCHER;

Am I asking you to —

Overrule the Rosenberg case.
No, sir.

I am not asking you

24

to overrule that case at all.

What I am suggesting

25

though is that that case since it was decided 23 years

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

before the minimum contact standard was ever established

2

and dealt purely with the question of whether or not

3

purchases alone equated with corporate presence which

4

was the fiction which was then being used and which was

5

later abandoned by this Court.

6

controlling in a case involving commercial contacts

7

which is now the minimum contact standard.
I do not think that the Rosenberg decision

8
9

That is no longer

needs to be overruled.
QUESTION*

10

I just think that it is —

Well, would you think you had

11

enough if there was nothing in the case except the

12

purchase of the helicopters?
MR. PLETCKER*

13

I certainly would not have

14

enough in the case if counsel persuades this Court to

15

ignore purchases as he requests.

Yes, sir.

Do you have some cases that support

you ?
NR. PLETCHER*

Well, Your Honor, I have

22

basic a lly the Perkins case.

The Perkins case is not

23

unlike this case except in one way and that is that

24

the re the Philippine company president because the

25

J a p an e se had taken over the Philippine Islands flew back

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to his home state of Ohio and was actually physically

2

present there.
But the basic factual situation in that case

3
4

is the same as it is here.

5

Q0 EST IONi

Is Perkins relied on below?

6

KB. PLETCHERt

Oh, res, sir.

Because there in

j j
7

the Perkins case a nonresident,

plaintiff sued a

8

nonresident defendant on a cause of action which was

9

entirely unrelated to contacts within the state, and

10

there this Court held that Ohio did not have to open its

11

courts but it was not constitutionally prohibited from

12

doing so.

13

That is basically our argument and has been

14

from the oustet in this case is that the contacts with

15

this nonresident defendant were so pervasive and over

10

such a long period of time and of such substance that it

17

is then what we ask the Court to do and what this Court

18

has said is a proper thing to do is to look at the other

19

factors in this case as to whether or not it is

20

reasonable and fair to ask a nonresident defendant to

21

appear in the forum state to defeni a cause of action.

22

It is our belief and we urge upon this Court that once

23

you look at this case on those other relevant matters

24

they all come down favoring the Plaintiffs.

QUESTION:

6

That is the second

Well, a resident of Ohio buys some

7

stock in the helicopter company ani the company is not

8

doing very well and they think the directors are guilty

9

of fraud or something so they want to bring a derivative

10

suit.

Can they bring a derivative suit or can they sue

11

the directors of the helicopter company in Texas, sue

12

the helicopter company itself?
HR. PLETCHER:

13

Yes, sir.

I believe they could

14

if it is shown that the helicopter company is doing

15

business on a consistent basis in Texas.
QUESTION:

16
17

You mean on these very facts of

yours you think that suit would lie?
HE. PLETCHER:

18

Yes, sir.

They have a general

19

presence in the State of Texas under those

20

circum stances.
It is for that reason that it is fair and

21
22

reasonable to expect them to come in and defend that

23

case.

24

the second peg of the minimum contacts standard set

25

forth in International Shoe protects defendants against

But, Your Honor, the fairness doctrine which is

1

those kind of casas that in a given case may render it

2

unfair and unjust and not in keeping with the

3

traditional notions of fair play.
Thera is another matter that T would like to

4
5

discuss particularly with reference to a question by

6

Justice O'Connor, and that is whether or not in the

7

country of Peru the Plaintiffs could have sued Bell

8

9

think that it is not possible even if we assume that the

Your Honor, from this record I

I think that there is absolutely no showing

Bell Helicopter, and it is true that the Plaintiffs, ay

3

clients, failed to raise a fact issue as to negligence

4

5

is also true that the helicopter company's claim of

fact issue.

8

A case such as this is almost a certainty.

9

When a helicopter flies into a tree in a fog and all

It

prepared to have the case decided on the Perkins case.

The facts in the Perkins case are that it was

ani the position I think of this Court in the Perkins

2

case »as as a commentator says it is never a violation

3

of due process for a defendant to be sued in his own

4

backyard.
In that case the defendant had in effect set

up an office.

7

under those circumstances a defendant should be subject

to suit on any cause of action, ani that is essentially

9

what this Court held in that case.

He was equivalent to a domiciliary and

Perkins came after International Shoe and

10

11

Perkins was in a sense signaled by International Shoe

12

because the language in International Shoe suggested

that there would be circumstances in which the contacts

facts as to whether it arose out of the purchases.

3

Notwithstanding the fact in Posenberg that the

4

cause of action arose out of conduct in the State of New

purchase of a significant amount of capital as well as

inventory is not sufficient to form basis for

is simply that he represents United States citizens and

that his court, the Texas court, should provide a forum

QUESTION?

14

world-wide due process clause administered perhaps by

15

the World Court of the Hague and that court had decided

contacts for a country certainly somewhere in the United

18

States should qualify as minimum contacts to adjudicate

this dispute don’t you think?

20

HR. WHALEN:

No, Your Honor.

There are no

21

minimum contacts as I understand the doctrine of minimum

22

contacts from International Shoe that the cause of

23

action simply did not arise out of those contacts.

24
25

QUESTIONS

Well, it did not arise but all the

plainciffs reside in the United States.

of several of the United States no one of them seems

The constitutional due process

which is the argument I am proposing to this Court is

the due process which should be accorded to this

Defendant.

14

this Court should not find jurisdiction where he can be

I do not believe as a matter of the United

country.

22

of the argument of my adversary.

23

I believe that that is the fundamental basis

This Court because they are the United States

24

says it must find a forum.

I think

that in this case

under the present rulings of this Court there is no

jurisdiction in Texas — There is no basis for holding

3

Helicol subject to the jurisdiction of Texas on this

4

cause of action.

5

My adversary has not disputed the fact that --

6

What he is relying on are soley the purchases of capital

7

equipment in Texas and a single contract discussion

8

which lasted only about two hours in the City of

9

Houston, and that is the basis upon which he is claiming

10

that my client is subject to suit on a cause of action

11

which happened in South America.
