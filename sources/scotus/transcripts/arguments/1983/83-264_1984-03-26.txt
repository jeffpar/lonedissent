whether the fact that the Fair Employment Statute remedy

I will argue that Maryland’s Fair Employment

there are sound reasons of public policy supporting its

application to Respondents' suit; and finally, that the

2

Maryland statutory six-month limitation period is fully

3

adequate for Respondents to assert their cause of action.

4

As to the first issue concerning the

5

appropriate analogy.

6

Practice Statute which is Article 49B of the Maryland

7

Code is the closest analogy to Respondents* suit.

8

in that regard, it has almost no competition concerning

9

which is the analogous statute.

Maryland's Fair Employment

QUESTIQHt

And

On that point, I notice that the

11

Respondent cited a case, federal case Davidson v.

12

Koerber that referred to Article 23 of the Maryland

13

Declaration of Rights, in which the District Court held

14

that it’s beyond dispute that Maryland's Article 23

15

protects the same interests as the 14th Amendment, and

16

therefore Section 1983.

17

You think the Respondents could have brought

18

an action under Article 23 in this case, then, in

19

M a r yl a n d ?

20

KR. STRAIN;

Justice O'Connor, I think the

21

Respondents very definitely could not have brought an

22

action under Article 23.

23

They did bring an action under Article 23, and as the

24

district judge found, there is no action under Article

25

23.

Let me correct that slightly.

Maryland courts have never recognized any direct

was such an action.

11

were to address the issue of whether there is a direct

12

cause of action under the Maryland Constitution, I think

13

for the same considerations that led this Court in Eush

14

v. Iucas not to infer such a cause of action where there

15

is a comprehensive statutory scheme, for that same

16

reason, I would expect the Maryland court -- Maryland

17

Court of Appeals not to infer direct cause of action for

18

employment discrimination.

Of course, if the Maryland courts

And after all, that is what Respondents

Grattan and Hedman are challenging.

QUESTION*

And I submit that

Mr. Strain, the Court cf Appeals,

though , said that the Maryland legislature intended the

6

three-year statute cf limitations period to apply to

7

Section 1983 actions.

8

MR. STRAIN*

9

Justice O'Connor, I don't recall

that precise language in Chief Judge Winters' opinion

10

for the Fourth Circuit.

11

Chief Judge Winter where he questioned whether the

12

Maryland legislature intended the Fair Employment

13

Statute to apply to Section 1983.

14

suggested that the catch-all provision, Article 5-101 of

15

the court's article was intended to apply to Section

16

1983.

17

he was very wrong.

18

I think I recall language of

I don't think he

If he did say that, I submit very respectfully,

QUESTION*

Well, what if a legislative body

19

expressly said it intended a longer statute of

20

limitations to apply, would you give recognition to that?

21

MR. STRAIN:

Justice O'Connor, if for example

22

the Maryland legislature had intended the catch-all

23

provisions to apply to civil rights statutes, I think

24

that would be important to this Court in determining

25

what was the appropriate analogy.

I think it would not be binding.

Justice O'Connor.

5

What this Court locks for is the appropriate

analogy for the individual Section 1983 cause of

action.

8

that all civil rights statutes along with -- actions --

9

along with many other things, be governed by a

court would consider.

QUESTION;

It would not be binding on this

decided that question, have we?

19

MR. STRAIN;

Whether a legislative

Justice O'Connor, I think this

20

Court has not directly decided the issue.

However, in

21

the Del Costello opinion,

22

don't recall the number offhand -- but a footnote which

23

dealt with the argument that the Congress, in enacting

24

Section 10(b) of the NCRA, had not intended it to apply

25

to Secton 301 suits.

there was a footnote -- and I

And this Court observed that the

1

fact that Congress had not intended that it apply tc

2

Section 301 suits was no more despositive than the fact

3

that the New York or Maryland legislatures had not

4

intended their statutes for actions tc vacate

5

arbitration awards to apply.

6

And I think, while this Court has net decided

7

it, that footnote may give a strong indication of how

8

this Court would go.

9

And as I said, I think there is nothing in

10

either the language cr the logic of this Court's

11

decisions which, supports the Respondents'

purposes.

1

untoward.

2

the logic of this Court's opinions that gives the

3

Respondents no support for their position, because as

4

this Court's opinions on borrowing and applying statutes

5

of limitations demonstrate, what the Court is involved

6

in may be termed an inexorable search for the

7

appropriate analogy based on the nature of the cause of

8

action, a search for the best fit; not a perfect fit,

9

not something that is hand-in-glove .

10

find it is net only the language; it is also

As the Court observed in the United Parcel

11

Service opinion, the Court does not expect or search for

12

a hand-in-glove perfect analogy, but the best analogy.

3

And for that reason -- for example, in Section 301 suits

4

such as the United Auto Workers v. Hoosier suit in 1966,

5

the Court searched' for the nature of the cause of

6

action.

7

contract or on a written contract.

8

in the United Parcel Service opinion, the Court made the

9

same inquiry as to the nature of the cause of action.

Was it more appropriate to an action on an oral
And 15 years later,

20

Was it mere akin to an action to vacate an arbitration

21

award or more akin to an action on contract?

22

And for Section 1983 and ether civil rights

23

suits, the inquiry is the same.

The Court chooses the

24

statute of limitations by borrowing and examining the

25

nature of the cause of action, for in Section 1983, even

principles that apply in Section 301 suits, in Section

appropriate state limitations period.

6

And the Court has examined appropriate

7

limitations periods — I should say appropriate causes

8

of action in 1983 suits to determine what is the most

9

appropriate analogy.

10

The Runyon v. McCrary decision in 1976 is an

11

apt example.

12

five-year catch-all limitations period for a Section

13

1981 suit in favor of a two-year period that was -- cn

14

which a cause of action depended that was a better

analogy for

In that case, this Court rejected a

the Section 1981 suit there at issue.

QUESTION:

General Strain, may I ask you a

guesti cn?

18

MR. STRAIN:

19

QUESTION:

Justice Stevens.
Supposing the underlying claim cf a

20

constitutional violation here didn't involve

21

discrimination, but rather, was something like a First

22

Amendment claim or something like that; the employee was

23

discharged for speaking out about some issue.

24
25

I take it you would then say that that
particular 1983 claim -- the limitations period for such

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

an 1933 claim would be determined by seme other statute,

other than the one you're --

MR. STRAIN:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Stevens.
So you’re not contending all

are subject to this?

That’s very correct. Justice

Stevens.

because one of the initial causes of action was a free

claim.

We argued for a three-year limitations

10

period on the Section 1983 free speech claim.

11

within even the three-year period, and the trial judge.

12

Judge Ramsey, knocked cut the free speech claim because

13

it was

It wasn’t

QUESTION:

There’s a certain practical

awkwardness about that result, isn't there?

16

is suing for unconstitutional dismissal from employment,

17

to the extent his claim may sound in free speech, it's

18

three years; to the extent it may sound in racial

19

discrimination, it’s a much different period of time,

20

even though it’s the same facts perhaps out of which the

21

thing arises.

22

MR. STRAIN;

If a

person

Well, Justice Rehnguist, I

23

believe that normally it would not be the same set of

24

facts out of which the claim arises.

25

this case, the contention was either that they were

dismissed on the grounds of race or dismissed because

2

they were speaking cut.

3

More normally, there would be the coupling of

4

violation of a free speech claim perhaps that did not

5

lead to discharge, and discharge based on racial

6

reasons.

7

different causes of action in separate counts, as they

8

did in this case.

9

would apply to different counts, as if there was a

10

common law account in contract and account in tort.

11

And the complaint should set out those

So a different limitations period

And in summary, on the point of the purely

12

judicial cause of action, in each of the cases that have

13

been referred to, and in others, the Court has sought

14

the best analogy.

15

appropriate analogy was an administrative judicial

18

limitations period in Section 10(b).

17

Blackmon observed for the Court in Railway Express in

18

1975,

19

nothing justifies a special reluctance in applying state

20

law, as compared with what the Court does in other

21

situations such as Section 10(h).

22

In Del Costello last term, the most

And as Justice

when we're talking about civil rights statutes

Article 49B is the state analogy to Grattan

23

and Hedman’s employment discrimination suit.

And

24

Article 49B is an administrative judicial remedy that is

25

a lineal descendent of Section 10(b) which this Court

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

utilized last term in Del Costello

2

The second issue I wish to address this

3

morning concerns the sound policy reasons for borrowing

4

the F3ir Employment Practice Statute, statute of

5

limita ticns.

6

An important policy reason in favor of that

7

borrowing is the policy of uniformity.

8

has observed that a lack of uniformity is no reason to

9

defeat an application of state law.

Now, this Court

That observation

10

was made, for example, in the Temonio -- the Board of

11

Regents v. Temonio opinion in 1980.

12

was on the other foot, so to speak, because the

13

application of state law will not defeat uniformity, it

14

will promote uniformity.

But here, the shoe

As we make clear in our petition for

15
16

certiorari in a very long footnote, Footnote 7, there

17

are at least 30 states with Fair Employment Practice

18

Statutes that have limitation periods remarkably similar

19

to that of Maryland.

20

Employment Practice Statute limitation period will

21

promote national uniformity in this regard among the

22

states.

23

within Maryland, because then the state cause of action

24

and the federal cause of action for the same grievance

25

or the same matter will have the same limitations period.

So application of Maryland's Fair

It will also, of course, promote uniformity

QUESTION:

Is the state of limitations that

2

you want borrowed for this purpose in connection with

3

the discharge of a state employee?

4

ME. STRAIN*

The statute of limitations,

5

Justice White, comes from a statute which covers state

6

employees and privat employees.

7

applied for several — our case, of course, concerns a

8

public employee, and we ask that it be applied for these

9

public employees.

QUESTION:

We ask that it be

What dees that limitations period

11

say?

12

in the state court within a certain time?

13

Does it say that the discharged employee must sue

MR. STRAIN:

It says, Justice White, that the

14

discharged employee must file a claim with the Maryland

15

Human Relations Commission within six months, just as

16

the union employee must file a claim of unfair labor

17

practice charge with the NLRB within six months.

20

QUESTION :

If the claim is what -- racial

discrimina tion ?
MR. STRAIN:

If the claim is racial

discrimination, sex discrimination, handicap, age,

QUESTION:

And that’s the period you’re

referring to?

That's correct, Justice White.

QUESTIONS

It isn't a period connected with

2

any kind of a court proceeding?

3

ME. STRAIN:

No, it is not.

It is a period --

4

and I should stress this — the administrative structure

5

of Article 49B and the Maryland Human Relations

6

Commission is remarkably similar to the administrative

7

structure of Section 10B and the National Labor

8

Relations Act in an unfair labor practice charge with

9

the National Labor Relations Board.
QUESTION;

10

Dees the Maryland Code of Statutes

11

have a section on limitations generally and limitations

12

for different kinds of judicial proceedings, like the

13

limit actions in torts?
MR. STRAINS

14

The Maryland Code does not have

15

such a

16

specificity.

17

has several other specific periods for categories cf

18

actions such as assault and battery, defammation,

19

contracts under seal, and bends, and things of that

sort.

Is that right?

No, it is not.

It is not a

15

uniformity that would be promoted -QUESTION;

16

On that point, Mr. Strain,

I wonder

17

whether national uniformity can be said to be the

18

applicable policy if we're looking to Section 1988 which

19

tells us that if the federal law is deficient, we look

20

to state law.

21

state to state.

And we know state laws can differ from

So I wonder if national uniformity is a goal.

uniformity is a governing principle in light of Section

MR. STRAIN:

Justice O'Connor, I think

uniformity is not a governing principle.

This Court has

If the most appropriate analogy

The point I wish to make here is that the most

10

appropriate uniformity would have the happy byproduct,

11

if you will, of promoting national uniformity.

12

that remarkable similarity among the states for actions

13

such as this demonstrates is that there is a national

14

policy in favor of prompt resolution of employment

15

disputes, and it isn't just among the states.

16

reflected in actions of the United States Congress, such

17

as Title VII, and such as 10B, and in many, many

18

opinions of this Court, the national policy in favor of

prompt resolution of employment disputes, and I --

QUESTION:

And what

It is

But, Nr. Strain, if Section 1988

21

tells us to look at state law, and if the Court

22

intend the shorter period to apply, why doesn't that

24

have to inform our decision?

Well, let’s look at the — the

6

Fourth Circuit said that, did it not?

7

instance, in the appendix with the petition, reciting

8

the history and referring to Article 49E,

9

indicates that the Maryland legislature did not intend

It said, for

"This,

10

that the passing of 165-day period should bar an

11

employee," and so forth.

12

MR. STRAIN;

tcc,

Justice O'Connor, that passage is

13

referring to Article 64A, a grievance period that is an

14

alternative limitations period.

15

QUESTION;

Well,

But I would like to --

then, and earlier it said "It

16

is for this reason it was unlikely the Maryland

17

legislature intended that this limitations period apply

18

to civil actions," meaning 49B.

19

I certainly read the opinion anyway as

20

indicating CA4 thought the Maryland legislature did not

21

intend the shorter period to apply.

22
23
24
25

MR. STRAIN;

Yes.

And I would like to respond

very directly to that, Justice O'Connor.
I believe what the Fourth Circuit was locking
for was any indication that the Maryland legislature had

18

1983 in mind one way or the other when it created the

2

six-month period.

3

legislature have Section 1983 suits in mind when it

4

created the three-year catch-all period.

5

unrealistic —

6

It did not.

QUESTIONS

Well,

Nor did the Maryland

It would be

what if the CA U meant what I

7

said I thought it meant; namely, that Maryland didn’t

8

intend the shorter period to apply?

9

MR. STRAIN;

Then, Justice O’Connor, we get

10

back to the issue that we discussed before and that was

11

of what significance would that be to this Court.
My position is,

12

that would be of some

13

significance.

14

Costello opinion, the fact that Congress in Section 10B

15

did not intend that it be utilized for Section 301 suits

16

was no mere despositive than the fact that the New York

17

legislature did not intend an action to vacate an

18

arbitration award to be used for that section.

But as this Court noted in the Del

But I want to emphasize, as a matter of fact,

19

20

that there is no more indication that the Maryland

21

legislature intended the three-year period to apply to

22

Section 1983 than it intended the six-month period to

23

apply.

24

either of those two statutory periods.

25

It had no intention about Section

1983 as to

The Maryland legislature — there is no

19
ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

indication it ever thought about it.

2

history in Maryland is very skimpy, but there is nc

3

indication it had either statutory period in mind.

4

position is that on the question of legislative

5

intention, it very simply is a wash, and that avenue is

6

a blind avenue for purposes of this case.

7

QUESTION:

legislative

Cur

There is seme significance that the

8

writer of this opinion. Chief Judge Winter, is from

9

Maryla nd.

10

ME. STRAIN:

11

I would point out as well that the author cf

Yes, Justice Marshall, there is.

12

the District Court opinion who disagreed with Judge

13

Winter and was reversed by the Fourth Circuit was also

14

from Maryland.

MR. STRAIN:

If you are going to go that far,

you are, too.

(Laughter.)

20

MR. STRAIN:

22

Pardon me?

I wouldn’t be so bold,

Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Were you involved or was the -- I

23

suppose the Attorney General's office was involved in

24

the McNutt case — or not?

25

MR. STRAIN:

The Attorney General’s office was

I see.

As I recall, that was

in that case, I suppose?
MR. STRAIN;

I honestly don't know whether

there was a petition for certiorari or not.
QUESTION:

But that's the case that Judge

Winter thought was controlling here.
MR. STRAIN:

That's correct.

Judge Winter

11

relied on McNutt which, of course, was decided prior to

12

Del Costello.

13

been at least one motivating factor for the McNutt

14

opinion was that they thought it was wholly

15

inappropriate to use the limitations period of Article

16

49B because they said it was administrative.

And in McNutt, what seems to me to have

17

QUESTION:

Administrative, yes.

18

MR. STRAIN:

That's correct.

And I would

19

sugget respectfully to the Fourth Circuit that McNutt --

20

the reasoning of McNutt has been completely obviated by

21

this Court's opinion in Del Costello.

22

QUESTION;

Not entirely, General Strain,

23

because there's a footnote in the McNutt opinion

24

pointing out the irony of relying on a Maryland

25

administrative procedure rather than a federal

That you might

as well lock to the Title VII, the 180-day provision in

Title VII, if you're going to do that.

Costello, we locked to a federal proceeding.

Could you help me on one thing?

didn't mean to interrupt.

I

Rut under your h9B, the

10

equivalent of Title VII, does a time come when the

11

alleged victim of discrimination may bring some kind of

12

a judicial proceeding and, if so, when?

13

MR. STRAIN;

Justice Stevens, that time comes

14

after the administrative adjudication.

15

the employee, may appeal an adverse decision of the

16

administrative agency.

17

where there is an independent cause of action, and very

18

similar to Section 10B where there is an adjudication by

19

the NLRB and then appeal to the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION;

20

The Complainant,

And so it is unlike Title VII

He only gets review of the

21

administrative — he can't then bring his own damage

MR. STRAIN;

23

He cannot bring his own damage

24

action.

He gets review under the Maryland

25

Administrative Procedure Act.

That review is a fairly

robust, I would say, than the form of judicial review

that this Court observed in the New York Fair Employment

14

ON BEHALF CF THE RESPONDENTS

15
16
17

MR. LASKIN*

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
Petitioner's position is based upon a

18

fundamental error in the analysis of the functional

19

differences between the statute of limitations triggered

20

by Article 49B, Section 9A, and the routine judicial

21

statute of limitations which applies in litigation.

22

If applied to employment discrimination suits

23

in Maryland, the use of the Section 9A would lead to

24

three harmful effects*

25

of statutes of limitations within one state for actions

It would encourge a multiplicity

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983; it would encourage a

2

multiplicity of federal claims which might otherwise not

3

have to be brought, due to the shortnesss of the period;

4

and it would also encourage individuals to avoid

5

utilizing state procedures which, particularly after

6

this Court’s decision in Patsy, should be encouraged

7

rather than encouraged.

8

9

First, as to the functional differences, the
Respondents have never claimed that 49E is an

10

inappropriate statute of limitations to apply merely

11

because it invokes administrative remedies.

12

we say it’s an inappropriate period to apply is because

13

of the functional differences in the procedures which

14

are invoked.

The reason

4

15

Article 49B, like Title VII, is a multistep

16

enforcement procedure which ultimately culminates in a

17

formal

18

49B.

19

of the Section 9A complaint is an administrative

20

investigation.

21

-- and the agency has given itself two years and ten

22

months, in effect, from the date of the discriminatory

23

act to complete that process -- a lengthy process of

24

investigation, probable cause-finding, attempts at

25

conciliation which is central to the statutory scheme --

adjudicatory hearing under Section 11 of Article
However, all that is invoked by the initial filing

It is only after a very lengthy process

24
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

only after all of these has failed may the Commission

2

issue a formal statement of charges and compel the

3

Respondent to answer and prepare and present a defense.
Until that point, all that happens is an

4
5

administrative investigation.

6

The Karyland Court of Appeals has made very

7

clear in the Banach case that the filing of the 9A

8

complaint merely triggers that investigative process,

9

and that a respondent is not entitled to formal notice

10

of the claim in the sense of stating a claim against

11

that respondent until the invocation of the Section 11

12

enforcement proceedings which, as I've said, can take

13

two years and ten months from the date of the

14

discriminatory action, a period virtually the same as

15

the period we are urging upon the Court.
If 49B were to be applied to employment

16
17

discrimination suits within the State of Maryland, it

18

would encourage a multiplicity cf statute of limitations

19

within one state for claims under 1983 and 1981.

20

and 1983 apply to discrimination claims broader than

21

that of employment discrimination, broader than that of

22

4 9B.

23

1981

Therefore, if this Court were to hold that the

24

statute of limitations in employment discrimination

25

cases is six months, it would be multiplicity of

25

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

litigation over the issue of what the appropriate

2

statute of limitations is.

3

While it is true that national uifcrmity as

4

applied to 1980 is an impossibility, it does not fellow

5

from that that internal uniformity should not be

6

encouraged.

7

of limitations should not commence to run so soon that

8

lay people would find it difficult to invoke the

9

procedures.

10

As this Court made clear in Picks, statutes

If there were a different statute of

limitations under each and every 1981 or 1983 claim

13

MR. LASKIN;

I think that’s absolutely right.

And to the extent that the state is urging a statute of

4

limitations for public employees, then they must be

5

doing that by virtue of the 1983 aspect of the suit.

And they’re further complicating the question of what

statute of limitations would be appropriate outside of

10

I might point out that in Runyon v. McCrary,

11

one major reason for the decision was this Court was

deferring from the decision of the Fourth Circuit on a

13

matter essentially of state law.

19

that under that procedure, at least the administrative

months or something like that, after the charge is filed?

ME. LASKIN;

However, in two cases -- the

Maryland Court of Appeals and the Court of Special

Appeals have made it very clear there is a difference in

6

function between those two notices.

7

Banach made clear that all the 9A complaint

8

does is put the respondent cn notice that an

21

has stated a claim against the respondent and the

22

The State Commission reaffirmed Banach to that

extent.

It drew a distinction as far as the case was

25

before it, in that in that case, a Section 9A complaint

2

investigative subpoena, and for the purposes of

3

determining whether the subpoena was adequate, the 9A

complaint had to at least state how the individual was

discriminated against.

But at page 46, Xaryland Appeals 56, the

Ironically, the statute which the Petitioners

MR. LASKIN;

Well, I can speak from personal

14

experience.

15

for two years, and at the time that the district courts

16

in Maryland began to hold that the 1981 statute of

17

limitations was six months, in order to preserve their

rights, individuals represented by counsel filed a 1981

that the state raised.

to have administrative statutes of limitations similar

Well, what about the common sense

argument that utilization of the state procedure will be

And forego the federal suit, or
