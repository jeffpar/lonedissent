ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. CROSS*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
This case raises a unique issue.

Hr. Cross, you may

Does Public

Law 280 authorize a state to absolutely bar actions

10

against non-Indians by Indians if they arise on an

11

Indian reservation?

12

to review a decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court

13

affirming the State District Court's dismissal of

14

Petitioner's negligence and breach of contract action

15

against Respondent Wold Engineering.

This matter is here on certiorari

The facts of the case are simple.

16

Petitioner,

17

a federally recognized Indian tribe known as the Three

18

Affiliated Tribes, employed Wold Engineering to

19

construct a water supply system on the Fort Berthold

20

Indian

21

Reservation in northwestern North Dakota.
The project known as the Four Bears Water

22

Project was intended to provide a water supply from Lake

23

Sakakawea to a portion of the reservation population.

24

However, after completion of the project in 1977 defects

25

were discovered in that system that prevented the

3

1

accomplishment of that objective.
Despite attempts at correction by Wold

2
3

Engineering of the system Petitioner, Three Tribes,

4

commenced their negligence and breach of contract action

5

in the State District Court for the Northwestern

6

Judicial District o.f North Dakota.

7

Wold moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the

8

federal law prohibited state jurisdiction over the

9

act ion .

At trial in 1982

The trial court agreed on the grounds that the

10
11

Three Tribes failed to consent to Public Law 280 civil

12

jurisdiction over the reservation in favor of the state

13

and on

14

appeal to the Supreme Court of North Dakota the State

15

Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal construing a state

16

statute, Chapter 2719, which is included in our appendix

17

to cur brief, as evidencing the state legislature's

18

intent to disclaim any jurisdiction over the matter

19

until the Indians consented to Public Law 280

20

jurisdiction in the civil area.

21

that ground dismissed Petitioner's action.

Cn

The court noted in the course of its decision

22

which is in the appendix of the petition for cert that

23

state judicial jurisdiction had extended to these

24

actions against non-Indians by Indians prior to the

25

enactment in 1963 of Chapter 2719.

On that basis the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

State Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the

2

tribe's action against Wold Engineering.

3

Only two sections of Public law 280 are

4

involved in this matter. Section 6 and Section 7.

5

that jurisdictional classification scheme North Dakota

8

is a so-called optional state and a disclaimer state

7

meaning that under Section 7 it must take appropriate

8

action to amend its state constitution to remove the

8

federal disclaimer imposed in its admitting act, and

Under

10

secondly under Section 7 of Public Law 280 it must enact

11

affirmative legislation assuming jurisdiction under

12

Section 7.
QUESTION;

13

Mr. Cross, I take it since you are

14

appealing from the judgment of the highest court of the

15

State of North Dakota it is your position that there is

16

some federal constitutional principle or federal statute

17

which that decision has violated.
MR. CROSS;

18

That is right, Your Honor.

We

19

feel that the state court misconstrued Public Law 280 in

20

holding that it prohibits state court jurisdiction ever

21

actions of this sort.
QUESTIO??;

22

Well, do you think the Supreme

23

Court of North Dakota actually read Public Law 280 to

24

reach

25

well be construed to mean that the referendum in the

that result?

I thought its opinion could just as

Dakota that they did not want their courts to

HE. CROSS*

4

Your Honor Justice Eehnquist, the

5

decisi on itself indicates plainly that the state court

6

regard ed judicial jurisdiction of the state as extending

7

to the se actions before the enactment of the state

8

statut e involved under the authority of Public law 280.

9

The so le source of the authority reading it either as an

10

author ization or as compelling the state legislature to

11

take t hat action is the source of that disclaimer.
So taking a look at the state judicial history

12
13

und er the state constitution and under the course of

14

state judicial declaration the state had judicial

15

jurisd iction over these actions prior to that

16

ena ctm ent.

17

Sectio n 7 of Public Law 280 and consequently it concerns

18

the qu estion of federal interpretation.
QUESTION i

of sta te law is it not?
HR. CEOSSs

21
22

That enactment was explicitly taken under

That is correct, Justice

Rehnqu ist.
QUESTIONS

This case is a curious one, is it

24

not, b ecause here the tribe is asserting jurisdiction in

25

the st ate court and usually these cases come up here in

6

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

just the reverse posture.
NR. CROSS;

2

That is correct, Justice

3

Blackmun.

It is a surprising case in the sense that the

4

Indian people here are asserting the right as citizens

5

the rights that they have in common with other members

6

of the state to sue in state court.

7

constitutional question that is at stake is that assume

8

that Public Law 280 was lifted out of this context and

9

that this action was taken solely as a matter of state

So the

10

law would that violate equal protection and due process

11

rights of the Indian people involved.
QUESTION;

12
13

Was your due process argument

argued below?

14

KR. CROSS;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, it was, Your Honor.
hr. Cross, I suppose that it would

16

not be necessary to reach that if in fact we thought

17

that Public Law 280 was the grounds on which the North

18

Dakota court based its holding and we could I suppose

19

give North Dakota another look at it.
KR. CROSS;

20

That is correct. Justice

21

O’Connor.

Our position is this is that the state

22

statute is based on a misconstruction or on a

23

construction of Public Law 280 and that raises a federal

24

law question that is appropriate for resolution by this

25

Court.

Let me ask you another question.

2

MR. CROSS:

3

that limited extent.

4

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor, to

Is there any jurisdictional problem

5

of a state court asserting jurisdiction against an

6

Indian tribe over a- claim arising on the reservation?

7

MR. CROSS:

Your Honor, based on the state

8

court decision below they did not differentiate between

9

claims by tribal members or claims by tribes.

Based on

10

their reading both of the state law and of Public law

11

280 they did net make a distinction in that regard.

12

If there were a distinction tc be made I think

13

that would have to be made by the court below on remand,

14

but here in the decision they made no distinction

15

between the rights of the tribe to sue in state court

16

nor am I certain they could tut in fact they did net.

17

The state court decision below established a

18

simple proposition:

19

Public Law 280 civil jurisdiction or they are barred

20

from suing non-Indians in state court.

21

has been enacted for over 30 years now, and the

22

decisions by this Court make clear that there is no

23

legal cr factual connection between suits against

24

non-Indians and Public Law 280.

25

either the Indian tribes consent to

Public Law 28C

It is possible to give quite a full account of

9

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 626-0300

1

what the meaning both in the plain terms and the

2

legislative history of Public Law 280 is in the light of

3

recent decisions by this Ccurt most notably Kennerly v.

4

District Court, Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation and

5

Bryan v. Ithasca County.

6

QUESTIONj.

Hr. Cross, am I correct under the

7

decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court your people

8

have no forum whatsoever?

9

NR. CROSS:

That is correct. Your Honor.

10

Now in the course of those decisions that I

11

mentioned this Court has construed the application of

12

Public Law 280 in a variety of contexts, in cases cf

13

non-P.L. 280 in HcClanahan v. Arizona State Tax

14

Commisson, in cases where the states assumed full F.L.

15

280 jurisdiction in Bryan v. Ithasca County and in cases

16

where the state has assumed partial jurisdiction in

17

Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation.

18

In each of those cases this Court has

19

construed the plain terms and the legislative intent of

20

Public Law 280 as being remedial in nature, and by this

21

I mean that Congress intended to correct problems on the

22

reservation both in the criminal and in the civil

23

jurisdictions.

24

provided that the state if they assume civil

25

jurisdiction may adjudicate cases between Indians even

In Bryan v.

Ithasca County this Court

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

as between Indians and may apply their state lav to

2

govern

3

those actions.
Consequently in this Court's decisions

4

construing Public Law 280 there is no indication that

5

preexisting rights of Indians were terminated, and this

6

Court in a course of decisions over the last hundred or

7

more years has indicated that Indians have the right to

8

seek the aid of state courts and state statute in

9

protecting their property against intrusion by

10
11

non-In dians.
Justice Lamar in Choit v. Trap at 224 U.S. 665

12

said that Indians' rights, their private rights, are

13

enforced to the same extent and in the same way as other

14

residents or citizens of the United States.

15

decision came in the context of Indians enforcing their

16

federal tax exemption in state court.

17

That

The power the Indian people have to sue in

18

state court to protect their property rights has been

19

exercised on a number of occasions, first, in a decision

20

in 1857 Fellows v. Blacksmith

21

affirmed a state court order ejecting non-Indians from

22

tribal lands.

23
24
25

19 Howard this Court

This Court likewise indicated that the states
may seek the aid of state statute in New York

—

Those were cases, were they net.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

where the state court had affirmatively said we have

2

jurisdiction.

3

that exercise of jurisdiction.

We want jurisdiction.

This Court upheld

Here you have a different situation where I dc

4

5

not see those are necessarily relevant because here the

6

state court says our law provides that in the absent of

7

consent by the Indians under the 1968 revisions of the

8

Public Law 280 we are not to exercise jurisdiction.
ME. CPOSSs

9

That is correct, Justice

10

Eehnquist.

However, that decision turns on an

11

interpretation of Public Law 280.

12

clearly states that the Court feels that the state

13

legislature was disclaiming jurisdiction under Public

14

Law 280.

The decision below

Consequently, the question arises does Public

15
16

Law 280, not state law authorize a bar against these

17

sorts of actions?

18

construction of Public Law 280 this Court has said that

19

state legislations enacted under that authority cannot

20

be construed as termination or abrogation of preexisting

21

rights.

22

I think it is clear that in the

In Bryan v. Ithasca County this Court held

23

that civil jurisdiction granted under statute was for a

24

very limited purpose, and it was not intended to

25

indicate that the state had broader authority beyond the

12

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

terms of that act to tax Indian property.
Consequently if there was a negative reading

2
3

of Eublic Law 280 so that the state felt compelled to

4

disclaim jurisdiction outside of Public Law 280 that is

5

a matter of federal law and federal construction of the

6

statute.
QUESTION;

7

8

What you want is to have the North

Dakota Supreme Court take another look at the situation
disabused of any misapprehension about 280.

10

MB. CROSS;

That is correct. Justice.

11

In the context of the situation where the

12

state assumes no Public Law 280 jurisdiction this Ccurt

13

has still recognized that the Indians have access to

14

state courts for actions arising on reservations.

15

McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commission this Court in

16

deciding an issue of whether the state of Arizona may

17

tax Indian income said that Indians have access to state

18

courts to sue non-Indians citing the case of Felix v.

1

Patrick which is cited in our briefs.

In

Secondly, in that same case this Court

20
21

indicated that the states have a recognized interest in

22

regulating non-Indian conduct citing Surplus Trading Co.

23

v. Cook.

24

jurisdictional rules and relationships outside of the

25

plain terms of the act and what the intent of the act

Consequently it is clear that the preexisting

13

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 626-0300

1

was were not disturbed.
In other words, if the Indians were recognized

2
3

as having access under state law to state court and if

4

the state took the position they had the authority tc

5

regulate non-Indian conduct on reservations as North

6

Dakota did before the enactment of Chapter 2719 under

7

Public Law 280 it would seem that that jurisdictional

8

relationship was not disturbed.
QUESTION;

9

Mr. Cress, may I ask a question

10

because when one reads the North Dakota Supreme Court’s

11

opinion one might get the impression -- At least I get

12

it the first time I read it — that they were just

13

construing their own law and they did not feel compelled

14

to construe it the way they did by Public Law 280.

15

I ask if in the briefs and argument before that court

16

did your opponent argue that Public Law 280 required

17

them to deny jurisdiction or did he rely on North Dakota

18

law?

19

ME. CEOSSi

Can

As I read the appellate record in

20

the North Dakota Supreme Court the position taken by

21

Respondent was that Public Law 280 authorized the state

22

to enact Chapter 2719 and disclaim jurisdiction that it

23

previously claimed or in the alternative that Public Law

24

280 was the nature of a preemptive statute which by a

25

negative reading precluded —

14
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

QUESTION;

1

That reading would be consistent

2

with ycurs, but the former reading would just merely

3

authorize if they decided

4

suppose they could have claimed they had the authority

5

even without Public Law 280.
MB. CROSS;

6

to authorize them to dc it.

I

That would raise a different

7

issue.

That issue would be raised in the context of a

8

state policy barring Indians.

9

North Dakota that is reviewed in our brief indicates and

The legal history of

10

repeated declarations of the Supreme Court that Indians

11

along with other state citizens are entitled to sue in

12

state court.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. CROSS;

15

QUESTION;

That was all before 1963.
That was before 1963.
Then they say that because of the

16

1963 enactment of 2719 which is a North Dakota statute

17

everything has changed.

18

MR. CROSS;

Cur expectation is that when this

19

issue is clarified by the Supreme Court on the

20

construction of the Public Law 280 or the federal law

21

issue that the prior declarations that was a matter cf

22

state constitutional law and federal constitutional

23

rights that the Indians do have access to state courts

24

for actions arising on reservations is the proper policy

25

they would follow.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

A recent decision by the Eighth Circuit Court

2

of Appeals entitled Poitra v. Eemarrias indicates that

3

is how the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals viewed the

4

repeated declarations cf the state supreme court.

5

that context they were called on to decide whether a

6

substantial state policy would be infringed if diversity

7

jurisdiction was allowed in the Indian case that arcse

8

on a reservation.

9

the state supreme court indicated no such policy.

10

In

They found that the declarations of

QUESTION*

I am just wondering if one possible

thing we should consider is perhaps sending the case
12

back to that court and asking them the basis of their

3

decision because if it is one basis then it presents a

4

federal constitutional question.

If it is another basis

5

it presents a statutory question.

I do not think it is

6

as clear as you tell us to be hcnest with you.

7

HR. CROSS*

That is correct, Justice.

That

8

would be one option to clarify the underlying basis cf

9

the decision.

I do feel that based on the prior

20

decisions of the State Supreme Court the Eigth Circuit

21

Court of Appeals* decision in Foitra that it is quite

22

clear that the sole basis for decision was federal law.

23

I do admit that there could be some ambiguity,

24

but I do not see it either in the record or in the state

25

court's decision below.

I think that if the legislature

what this Court has to say very seriously indeed.

You are saying it would take a new

11

act of the legislature, not just a new decision of the

12

Supreme Court of North Dakota?

13

MR. CROSS:

No, I am saying, Justice

14

Rehnguist, that the statute as construed by this Court

15

since it is under the authority of a federal law and a

function of the delegated power would take on a new

17

aspect to that court.

QUESTION:

You are also relying on decisions

22

MR. CROSS;

That is correct.

There were

23

decisions subsequent to that statute and that decision

24

that indicated that Indians do have access to state

25

courts for certain purposes.

That is the case of White

addressing Justice Stevens’ concern, that is, the exact

basis on which to the extent that we can discern it from

judgment.

I draw the Court’s attention to the end of

The court is here addressing and very

16
17

conscious of the constitutional problem both under the

18

state constitution and under the federal constitution.

19

It would arise if the state courts were closed to

20

Indians in this discriminatory way absent special

21

authorization by the Congress for that closure.
The court concludes its opinion by saying

after discussing this constitutional problem and saying

24

that it does not stand as an impediment to their

result.

10

We, therefore, find no

It seems to us plain that the North Dakota

11

Supreme Court was resting its judgment that no

12

constitutional violation either of its own or of the

13

federal constitution was involved only because they

14

construed Public Law 280 as having authorized not as

15

Public Law 280 does authorize an assumption of new

16

jurisdiction but a disclaimer, a repudiation of

17

preexisting jurisdiction.

18

If the North Dakota Supreme Court were

19

disabused of that misreading of Public Law 280 every

20

indication is that the court would then find that there

21

was no justification under either its own constitution

22

or under the federal constitution for uniquely closing

23

the courts of the state to Indian plaintiffs whether the

24

tribe or individual members.

25

that the appropriate disposition is to remand the case

18

Our suggestion is simply that as a matter of

more a ppropriate to afford the highest court of the

21

state an opportunity to correct its own error without

22

QUESTION;

10

He likewise

How about Section 1981?

Do you

11

think that is applicable if this Court goes ahead and

12

tries to solve the problem?
MR. CLAIBORNE*

13

It dees seem to us that

14

Section 1981 may well be applicable.

However, it is

15

fair tc say that as far as I am aware that ground was

16

not argued below, and accordingly it might be

particularly inappropriate for this court to reach that

18

questi on.

19

He simply mention it as one more indication of

20

the problem that is created by this misreading of Public

21

Law 280.

22

Public Law 280 was intended in its own words under

23

Section 6 to remove impediments to the assumption of

24

jurisdiction, not to erect new impediments — No license

25

is given for that — and to the assumption of

jurisdiction, not a disclaimer of jurisdiction.
likewise Section 7 is clear in that it gives

3

federal permission to states net having jurisdiction

4

over certain categories of claims involving Indians to

5

assume jurisdiction, not to repudiate previously

6

existing jurisdiction.

7

I may say that the North Dakota amendment to

8

its constitution itself suggests no direction to the

9

legislature of the state to repudiate any previously

10

existing jurisdiction.

Gn the contary, all that

11

happened in 1958 is that the people of that state in

12

response to Public Law 280 and with in a way that on its

13

face seems unobjectionable said, "We retain our

14

disclaimer of jurisdiction over Indian lands provided,

15

however, that the legislature may accept such

16

jurisdiction as is delegated by act of Congress."

17

That in no way to us suggests any repudiation

18

of preexisting jurisdiction, and indeed the 1963 act of

19

the state legislature speaks of jurisdiction being

20

extended to cases involving Indians, nothing about

21

disclaiming or repudiating older jurisdiction.

22

those statutes and constitutional amendments read in

23

that way it is and must be inviting to the Supreme Court

of North Dakota to reconstrue those statutes which are

perfectly able to be read as consistent with Public law

Of course, it is possible to argue that

notwithstanding Public Law 280 the states might be free

which

I thought was today before this Court.

In

Petitioners’ petition for a writ of certiorari the

question presented was did the state trial court have

galloped around in the various briefs.

possibly I should not do it — I thought I would try and

2

bring it back to the question as it existed on the

3

application for writ of certiorari by showing the

4

distinction, but it is easy to find the distinction if

5

the Court will simply recognize that in the government's

6

brief cn the certiorari application they stated the

7

question.

8
9

There are some extraneous words in it that
should be stricken, but when that is dene it comes

10

basically back to the Petitioners' question, and in our

11

brief on the same pcint the certiorari the question

12

there then comes very close to what I have outlined.

13

Then it begins to deviate, and in the Petitioners' brief

14

on the merits the questions presented which

15

presumptively to me mean the issues there are now three

16

different questions set out.

17

Number one is not in

this proceeding at all in

18

my judgment.

Number two should be carved of extraneous

19

language to bring it somewhat within the question upon

20

which we think the writ of certiorari was granted, and

21

number three should be also reworked because we now get

22

into equal protection and due process clauses.

23

say this that those clauses were argued in the North

24

Dakota Supreme Court, and the North Dakota Supreme Court

25

did reach those issues.

Let me

the case.

argument advanced by both counsel for the Petitioner and

counsel for the government.

in its conclusion and specifically that the North Dakota

Supreme Court should have recognized that it had prior

jurisdiction.
What counsel for the Petitioners is arguing

9

The argument seems to be

today Is that 280 did not bar a prior exercise of

10

jurisdiction by a court, but that presumes something.

11

This Court has stated many times in these cases that the

12

jurisdiction must be conferred by an act of Congress.

13

Now until 280 which this Court has said in

14

several recent cases -- I believe you said it just a

15

couple of months ago in the New Wexico v. Wescalero

16

Apache case — that 280 was the first, not the second,

but was the first grant of power of general
