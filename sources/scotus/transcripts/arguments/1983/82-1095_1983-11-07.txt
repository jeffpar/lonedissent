ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WELLINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises in the context of the ten-year
effort on the part of the states to establish constitu­
tionally valid death penalty laws.

11

Harris was tried under California's 1977

12

statute enacted in response to this Court's series

13

of decisions in the Gregg series of cases.

14

claims that the California's statute was unconstitutional,

15

in part because its perceived lack of proportionality

18

review had been denied at all state levels.

17

And, his

His direct appeal was affirmed and his habeas

18

corpus petition was narrowly denied by the California

19

Supreme Court which, at that point, vacated its stay

20

of execution and essentially remitted him to the

21

executioner.

22

The United States District Court also denied

23

habeas corpus relief, holding, as the California courts

24

had, that proportionality review, at least as envisioned

25

by Harris, was not demanded by the federal Constitution.

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

After the District Court denied relief, appeal

1

2

was taken to the Ninth Circuit.

3

issued the ruling that we are concerned with here,

4

ruling that this Court's decisions in Gregg and in

5

Proffitt commanded the conducting of a proportionality

6

review by the state, essentially commanding a comoarative

7

proportionality review, and also holding that the California

8

courts had on their own required the holding of a proportionally

9

review.

10

The Ninth Circuit

Now, we sought cert, from the Ninth Circuit

11

holding to clarify, and in my view, correct the holding

12

of the Ninth Circuit that the Gregg cases required

13

proportionality review.

14

the holding that California cannot execute Mr. Harris

15

until that review has been conducted.

16

And specifically to correct

There are four points that I am hoping to

17

raise here today.

18

Amsterdam's invitation to this Court to not decide

19

the issue, I am going to urge that the issue must be

20

decided on the merits.

21

The first one, in response to Professor

Second, I wish to address the concept of

22

proportionality and what that term means in this case

23

and to urge that proportionality in this context means

24

precisely what this Court said that it means at the

25

end of last term in Sollin v. Helm and in some previous

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

cases this Court has decided.
The third point that I am hoping to reach

3

is the question of what review is necessary on the

4

issue of proportionality and I am going to urge that

5

the review of that issue is no different than the review

6

commanded of any other constitutional issue; that is

7

it is an issue that should be addressed by the Court

8

if raised by counsel, if raised by the parties, if

9

raised on a supportive record..

10

And, finally, I am going to urge that this

11

Court should rule as a matter of law that death for

12

personally and intentionally inflicted murder is not

13

disproportionate, something the Court has come very

14

close to doing on two prior occasions.

15

Now, I would like to begin —

16

QUESTION;

Mr. Wellington, I would like to

17

ask you if at some time you would explain to us in

18

your view what is the procedure that California courts

19

follow in the review of death cases.

20

clear to me precisely what it is that the California

21

courts, the appellate courts at the highest level,

22

would look to.

23

MR. WELLINGTON;

It isn't altogether

Certainly, Justice O'Connor.

24

Under the California statutes, every death sentence

25

is automatically appealled to the California Supreme

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Court and that court reviews any contentions of error

2

raised by the defendant, the appellant, in that court.

3

That is the scope of review in that court.
Essentially, it is the same as with any other

4

5

appeal to the California Supreme Court with the one

6

exception that in death-sentence cases each death-sentence

7

defendant has an automatic right to have his issues

8

heard by the California Supreme Court.
So, the court reviews the issues that are

9
10

raised by the parties, raised by the defendants.

11

is what happened here, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

All right.

That

And, if the defendant

13

seeks a proportionality review, then that court would

14

make it?

15

Is that what you are saying?
MR. WELLINGTON:

What I am saying, Your Honor —

16

I am saying that in essence and perhaps I had best

17

step back just for a second to explain what I perceive

18

proportionality review to be, to explain how the

19

California courts are constituted to give it and has

20

been giving it, in fact, where it has been asked for.

21

That is that I say proportionality review

22

is an addressing by either the California Supreme Court

23

or this Court in an appropriate case of the proportionality

24

of the sentence actually meted out by the sentencing

25

authority and that review —

QUESTION:

Proportionality to the crime.

2

MR. WELLINGTON:

Proportionality in the way

3

this Court defined proportionality last term in Sollin

4

v. Helm which includes, Your Honor an examination of

5

whether it is proportional to the crime.

6

One of the points I made in my brief, and

7

I think it is crucial to this decision, is that

8

proportionality as this Court defined it very carefully

9

last term and as this Court has used the concept in

10

its previous cases, Endman v. Florida and Coker v.

11

Georgia, is exactly, precisely the same proportionality

12

analysis that the California Supreme Court has used

13

for over a decade, first announced in the early '70's

14

in In re Lynch.

15

even announced in precisely the same order as this

16

Court has.

17

It uses precisely the same three steps,

QUESTION:

May I ask, further on Justice

18

O'Connor's question, does that mean they do not, in

19

the California appellate system, compare this sentence

20

with other similar cases throughout the state?

21

MR. WELLINGTON:

Not on what Professor Amsterdam

22

has called a cross-case comparative basis, Your Honor.

23

The primary distinction, I believe, between the kind

24

of proportionality analysis that Harris is urging and

25

that that we are urging is that — And, the Ninth Circuit,

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

of course, agreed with Harris' position, is that the

2

Ninth Circuit position involves an examination of all

3

of the aspects of each case, all the aggrevating and

4

mitigating circumstances of the case before the court,

5

compared them with all the aggravating and mitigating

6

circumstances with every other — either every other

7

death penalty case or, under some argument, every other

8

death eligible case that has arisen in the state since

9

the drafting of the statute.

\

QUESTION:

10

I thought they said that the

11

California courts had started to do that after this

12

case had been appealled.
MR. WELLINGTON:

13
14

Honor.

That is inaccurate, Your

That is inaccurate.

15

QUESTION:

16

of the opinion is inaccurate?
MR. WELLINGTON:

17
18
19

They are inaccurate or my reading

not -QUESTION:

Because the Ninth Circuit was

20

inaccurate in thinking —

21

MR. WELLINGTON:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

The California courts have

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But, the Ninth Circuit did think

they were doing that.
MR. WELLINGTON:

That is apparent from the

Ninth Circuit opinion.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

2

MR. WELLINGTON:

The Ninth Circuit read two

«!

3

California Supreme Court cases, Frierson and Jackson,

4

to constitute a promise by the State of California

5

to conduct proportionality review.

6

I do not see any reasonable reading of either

7

Frierson or Jackson that says that.

What Frierson

8

and Jackson actually said is three things, in fact,

9

when addressed with the question — faced with the

10

question of whether the Constitution required propor­

11

tionality review and whether the California statute-

12

was unconstitutional for its failure to include the

13

proportionality review.

14

The California Supreme Court said first that

15

they do not read the majority of the Justices' opinions

16

in Gregg to require the proportionality review.

17

Second, that, nonetheless, under California

18

law, a disproportionate sentence would constitute error

19

and what they referred to as well established propor­

20

tionality principles, reference to the Lynch case,

21

they were fully capable of addressing the issue of

22

proportionality and that they had recognized in the

23

past that that was part of California's jurisprudence.

24
25

An examination of California Supreme Court
cases, both death penalty cases and non-death penalty

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

cases, makes it absolutely apparent that they do not

2

conduct that review automatically in each case.

3

conduct the review when the

4

they don't conduct that review on this cross-case com­

5

parative basis that the Ninth Circuit and Harris have

6

urged, rather just as this Court decided last year

7

in Sollin.

8

questions, types of cases, categories of crime.

9

issue

is raised.

They
And,

It is an examination of broader factual

I think the essential point is that the Lynch

10

test, which was adopted as to capital punishment in

11

the Frierson and Jackson cases is precisely the same

12

three-step test that this Court established last term

13

in Sollin v. Helm.

14

So, returning back to Justice O'Connor's

15

question, what does the California Court do, the

16

California Court provides a death sentence to defendant

17

with a very clear three-step test as to what propor­

18

tionality constitutes, precisely the same three-step

19

test that this Court has provided death sentence defendants

20

nationwide.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WELLINGTON:

23
24
25

And is not a cross-case comparison.
That is correct,Your Honor,

it is not a cross-case comparative analysis.
It is — I prefer frankly not to use the
term "proportionality review," because it implies some special

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

kind of hearing.

2

the issue of proportionality, no different, except

3

for the substantive issue itself, no different than

4

a review of the voluntariness of confessions.

5

6
7

It is a review of the question of

If the defendant has a case, he raises the
issue and the court addresses it.
So, that was offered, Your Honor, to Mr.

8

Harris in this case.

As the appeal was pending before

9

the California Supreme Court, as the briefs were being

10

written, the Frierson case expressly applied the eight-year

11

old, at that time, Lynch test to capital punishment,

12

applied to this growing issue of proportionality review,

13

inviting, it would seem to me, Mr. Harris to raise

14

the issue of proportionality if he was of the opinion

15

that his sentence was in any way disproportionate.

18
17
18

Although Frierson was discussed in Harris'
case, in his brief —
QUESTION:

Mr. Wellington, from the way you

19

describe the California Court's approach to proportionality

20

on the basis of In re Lynch, I take it one could

21

have a proportionality review of a 50-year jail sentence

22

under the —

23

MR. WELLINGTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

Exactly, Your Honor.

— if it is Sollin against Helm

you are talking about.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. WELLINGTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

2

In fact, the proportionality analysis from Lynch from

3

had been applied typically to non-death cases until

4

Frierson and Jackson, at which point the Court made

5

it clear that that same test was applicable to death

6

cases.

7
8

QUESTION:

So you still have the constitutional

argument to make, I guess.

9

MR. WELLINGTON:

10

That is correct, Your Honor.

The position that the Ninth Circuit has taken

11

very briefly is that this Court has already ruled on

12

the issue of proportionality review and the only language

13

onpoint,

14

the Ninth Circuit opinion, that addresses the federal

15

Constitution issue is the notation that the California

18

Court gave no indication that it had provided the

17

proportionality review required by Gregg and Proffitt.

18

the only

QUESTION:

language in the entire opinion,

Mr. Wellington, am I right in

19

thinking that the Ninth Circuit opinion didn't even

20

cite our case against Jurek against Texas?

21
22

MR. WELLINGTON:

not in what could be called the holding, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WELLINGTON:

25

That is correct, certainly

Yes.
It was cited in the opinion,

but —

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

QUESTION:

But not on that point.

2

MR. WELLINGTON:

That is right, notwithstanding

3

my repeated argument that Jurek stands for the proposition

4

that no such proportionality review is required.

5

I don't think it is necessary, given the

6

time given in the brief for the issue, it is not necessary

7

to go over the Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek cases here.

8

The point that I have that I think is clear is that

9

this Court did not in those cases demand proportionality

10

review as part of the death sentence.

11

issue here.

12

That is the

That is the issue here.

All this Court did in those cases is approve,

13

once they had proportionality review as apart of its

14

statutory system, approve one state, Florida, which

15

the Supreme Court has said it would conduct a

16

proportionality review exactly the same way California

17

has and reading of the Florida cases shows that sometimes

18

they examine proportionality, sometimes they don't

19

examine proportionality.

20

the question when it is raised.

21

Texas which has no such provision at all.

22

They, like California, address
Of course, there is

I think it is important in looking at the

23

constitutional Eighth Amendment question here to draw the

24

strong distinction between cross-case analysis and

25

what I would refer to as review of proportionality.

1

This Court's decisions, the Furman decision

2

and the Gregg decision, have expressed a very strong

3

concern about the issue of arbitrariness.

4

that were referred to in the Gregg series of cases

5

whereby it would be ensured that a jury, a sentencing

6

jury, or any sentencing authority would be given fully

7

informed, guided discretion in their decision, was

8

designed to ensure a freedom — a system designed to

9

be free from arbitrariness.

The procedures

That was the focus of

10

those cases, a concern that the petitions be free of

11

arbitrariness.

12

That is not all, however, that this Court

13

has provided for that area.

14

the states to establish a system, a statutory system

15

designed to avoid arbitrariness, there is the separate

16

issue of proportionality that this Court has discussed

17

for almost a century since the Weems case and most

18

recently in the context of the death penalty has dis­

19

cussed in the Coker versus Georgia case, Endman versus

20

Florida, and last term I think most clearly coalesced

21

in the Sollin v. Helm case.

22

In addition to requiring

The Court has said that no matter what the

23

statutory system is, no matter how well defined it

24

is, there still must be a proportionality to the judgment,

25

even if they are a result of a presumptively valid

case in the death sentence for rape in Coker and in

3

the death sentence for a non-personally committed,

4

non-intentional murder in Endman, if they are dispro­

5

portionate, then that has to be a way to review that.

6

They must be proportional, and if, as is the

California has no argument with that.

7

California has used that standard for over a decade.

What California urges is that it must be the kind of

review that this Court discussed in Helm for a couple

12

of very good reasons.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. WELLINGTON, ESQ.

SESSION

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WELLINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, ?nd may

it please the Court:
When we broke at noon I was beginning my
examination of the Eighth Amendment argument on the
question of proportionality review.
I think the most useful way to approach the

12

issue is to begin with a look at what this Court was

13

concerned about in Furman and Gregg as to the con­

14

stitutionality of the death penalty and that is

15

arbitrariness and I believe that all of the arguments

16

having to do with the question of proportionality and

17

whatever particular brand of that applies here are

18

really addressed to the question of controlling

19

arbitrariness.

20

The Court in Gregg established procedures

21

which states have followed to ensure against arbitrari­

22

ness, but the idea of proportionality is essentially

23

intended as a second line of defense in the individual

24

case against the possibility of an arbitrary result

25

being produced by one of the state systems.

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Unless we are to have two very different

2

constitutional motions of proportionality that this

3

Court announced in the Helm case last term and some

4

new one to be announced applicable to death penalty

5

cases, then I think we have to rely on what this Court

6

has said in Helm, which was based on the state work

7

done earlier in both Coker and in Endman, which is

8

precisely the same sort of proportionality that the

9

State of California has offered its death sentence

10

defendants, and, in fact, all defendants for well over

11

a decade.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Wellington, may I ask a question

13

about that?

14

of like any other appellate review of sentencing.

15

He just has to raise the question.

16

to have it heard.

As I understand your position, it is sort

17

MR. WELLINGTON:

18

QUESTION:

19

on his direct appeal in this case?
MR. WELLINGTON:

21

QUESTION:

23

That is correct, Your Honor.

And, he did not, in fact, do so

20

22

He has a right

He did not.

Did he do so on his state habeas

corpus proceeding?
MR. WELLINGTON:

He did not address the issue

24

of the proportionality of his sentence as the California

25

Supreme Court has envisioned proportionality and as

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

this Court has envisioned proportionality.

2

There was an allegation among the cloud of

3

allegations in his petition that the California

4

statute — They operated arbitrarily in that some others

5

have been spared under circumstances no less deserving

6

of the death penalty than Mr. Harris' petition.

7

8

That is not the consideration that this Court
has anounced —

9

QUESTION:

Let me ask it this way.

Did he,

10

in the state proceeding, raise the question that the

11

Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seems to have

12

decided?

13

MR. WELLINGTON:

He did demand a proportionality

14

review and to the extent — That is what the Ninth

15

Circuit concluded that he had a right to, yes.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And, did he get that proportionality

review in the state system?
MR. WELLINGTON:

He did not get the proportionality

19

review he demanded, Your Honor.

20

to be drawn.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WELLINGTON:

The distinction has

Why didn't he?
Because there is no right

23

to it under state law or under the federal Constitution,

24

Your Honor.

25

to have a court consider a claim that a particular

What I am urging is that there is a right

That claim was not made.

What if you were to make that claim right

Would it be open to him?

MR. WELLINGTON:

Would it be open to him?

Yes.

Would he have waived it by failing

to request it on his direct appeal?

My

question is if he were to make the claim for the first

a matter of California law, could he now make it?

MR. WELLINGTON:

It is not clear, Your Honor,

but I believe that he could.

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. WELLINGTON:

11

for that by that time.

12

course, trying to avoid.

That is what I am here, of

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WELLINGTON:

Yes.
I think it is important

15

that we look at why the cross case comparative

16

proportionality review is a terrible constitutional

17

idea and it is so for practical reasons as well as

18

theoretical ones.

19

The proportionality review this Court has

20

talked about in Sollin is something the courts:.can do.

21

It involves an examination of broad range of human

22

behavior, rape of an adult woman, murder committed

23

by someone who wasn't there and didn't intend murder.

24

And, it involves an examination of how such broad ranges

25

of conduct are treated by the legislatures and by the

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

2

courts.
The cross-case comparative review that Harris

3

and the Ninth Circuit speak of, if it is to be done

4

as it is clearly intended, every factor that may be

5

legitimately constitutionally considered by a jury

6

would have to be cranked into that analysis.

7

8

The courts, the tort courts that conducted
this review would have to consider the entire range
*

9
10

of considerations justifiably before a jury.
I would urge that is simply not possible.

11

I would urge two things.

It is simply not possible

12

for any one court to compare the hundreds of cases

13

that would be before them, some — for this Court to

14

do it, some 1200 nationwide in all of their particulars.

15

It would be directly contrary to this Court's language,

16

Justice Powell's language, writing for the majority

17

in Sollin, where the Court said that absent some specific

18

authority, it is not the role of theappellate court to substitu-

19

its judgment for that of the sentencing courts as to

20

the appropriateness of a particular sentence.

21

If we are to look at all of the factors that

22

go into a sentencing authority's determination to con­

23

demn a man, then necessarily, unavoidably, the Court

24

doing that is going to wind up substituting its judgment

25

for that of the sentencing authority.

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

That is something that is not only as a

2

practical matter impossible, it goes far beyond what

3

appellate courts are constituted to do, far beyond

4

what this Court has set its rule out to be with regard

5

to the state sentencing courts.

6

This Court's role has been announced in its

7

proportionality cases and is to examine the broad limits

8

within which a jury's discretion is to operate.

9

is exactly what the Sollin case, what the Coker case,

That

10

and the Endman case do.

11

expressly returns to the jury or leaves with the jury

12

the power and even the obligation to operate using

13

its own judgment within those limits.

It examines broad limits and

picture that remains so strongly with me of Robert

19

Harris, after killing these two teenaged boys, sitting

20

down eating their hamburgers and laughing at his younger

21

22

There is the

That is something properly committed to the

23

jury, that picture, their making their own decision

as to what kind of person is this and what kind of

judgment should be handed down with regard to him.

1

There is the picture of Robert Harris flicking

2

a bit of flesh off the end of his pistol and laughing

3

about how he sure blew that blonde boy's brains out.

4

That is properly commended to the jury for their con­

5

sideration on the issue of death.

6

But, if we are to do a cross-case analysis

7

of all death penalty cases in the nation, some court

8

is going to have to find a way to assign a qualitative

9

value to those —

10
11

QUESTION:

needs to look at all the

12

13

There isn't any claim that a state

I am sorry.

Well, speaking

just within a state, the California Supreme Court —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WELLINGTON:

QUESTION:

cases

Yes, all right.
— would have to look —

It is not the nation, it is the

state.

18

MR. WELLINGTON:

Although the issue specifically

19

in this case is that, Your Honor, and yet, as this

20

Court has applied proportionality, proportionality

21

analysis, it has done the analysis on a nationwide

22

basis.

23

So, it certainly could be extended to the nation.
But, looking just at the California Supreme

24

Court's obligation as it is envisioned by the Ninth

25

Circuit, they would have to look at those two factors,

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

those two factual matters, as well as the hundreds

2

of others presented in a case, find some way to compare

3

them in their own minds, in their own hearts, with

4

matters just as horrible but quite different in another

5

case.

6

There is no other case in California, probably

7

not in the nation, that featured facts of the type, of the

8

two types I just mentioned, and the facts in this case

9

would deal with several of those, but there is no other

10

11

case that has exactly that sort^of behavior.

-

So, doing a cross-case analysis is going

12

to have to have find some way to assign like a number value

13

to those kinds of facts that then compares to the number

14

value assigned to the parade of horribles in some other

15

case to judge the jury's determination.

16

This is not the way this Court has operated

17

with juries.

18

the federal Constitution envisions any court operating

19

with juries.

I would urge that this is not the way

20

What happens in the death-sentencing process

21

is, in my view, a very spiritual determination is made

22

by whatever body, whether it be a judge sitting as

23

a sentencing authority or whether it be the jury.

24

A very spiritual decision is made as to this individual',

25

guided by the information and the statutory guidance

QUESTION:

Mr. Wellington, would you think

that the federal Constitution might dispense with this

cross-case proportionality review in a particular state

and insist that it be performed in another because

7

of the differences in the capital punishment system

8

or would you think that if the Constitution doesn't

require this cross-case proportionality in California,

as you are arguing, it wouldn't anywhere?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G AMSTERDAM, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

Your time has expired

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

14

I would just like to make three points to

15

the Court this afternoon in response to Mr. Wellington's

16

argument.

17

First, I should like to explain why I disagree

18

with Mr. Wellington's answer to Justice O'Connor's

19

question and Justice Stevens' question as to what

20

California law is and why I believe that California

21

law may well offer all of the proportionality review

22

that we are asking for in this case and more.

23
24
25

California law in short is not limited to
Sollin v. Helm.
Secondly, I would like to argue that this

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

Court's decisions plainly imply, if they do not already

2

squarely held, that federal Eighth Amendment review

3

is also, in death cases, not limited to Sollin v. Helm.

4

And, finally, I would like to clear up any

5

question as to what Harris asked for in the state courts

6

to demonstrate that he has asked in the state courts

7

for exactly the kind of proportionality review that

8

California law does, in fact, allow and that we urge

9

the Eighth Amendment allows.

10
11

12

I will then ask that the judgment below for
those reasons be affirmed.
QUESTION:

Eighth Amendment allows or compels?

13

Does the Eighth Amendment allow proportionality review

14

or compelled it?

15

MR. AMSTERDAM:

The Eighth Amendment compels,

16

California law allows Eighth Amendment review,

17

proportionality review.

18

Let me start with California law and then

19

I will move to the Eighth Amendment.

20

thing to keep in mind about California law is that

21

it is in evolution, that none of us is very sure at

22

the moment exactly what California law does provide

23

or what the California Supreme Court does do.

24
25

The important

In Lynch, the California Supreme Court
announced a decision which was quite like this Court's

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

decision in Sollin v. Helm.

2

cases, which are collected in our brief in note 18

3

at pages 32 to 33 indicate, California has gone well

4

beyond that.

5

22 years imprisonment for a child molester is clear and

6

unusual punishment because it is disproportionate under

7

California law, something I suggest goes rather well

8

beyond Sollin v. Helm.

However, as the California

The Rodriguez, for example, holds that

9

Moreover, in a case which was decided since

10

we filed our brief, although it is cited in the reply

11

brief at page 34, which is People v. Dillon, the

12

California Supreme Court reduced a first degree murder

13

conviction to second degree murder because it violated

14

the California prohibition against excessive punishments.

15

It was clearly first degree murder within the statute.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Amsterdam, is that a state

17

constitutional provision which you refer to as the

18

California prohibition against excessive punishment?

19

MR. AMSTERDAM:

20

or unusual punishment clause, yes.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. AMSTERDAM:

State.

The California clear

Yes.
The Dillon case, the defendant

23

was clearly within the first degree murder statute.

24

It was a killing in the course of a robbery.

25

the California Supreme Court held that the defendant

Moreover,

30
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

had killed intentionally which was why it reduced this

2

punishment to second degree, which in California is

3

intentional murder.
Now, we have an intentional killing, one,

4
5

I might add, which was done by nine bullet wounds in

6

the course of a robbery.

7

Court, which could have held that that punishment was

8

not excessive, indeed, which could have held under

9

this Court's decision in Gregg, that the death penalty

And, the California Supreme

10

was not excessive for an intentional killing, went

11

ahead and reduced under California law the sentence

12

of life imprisonment, and, indeed, reduced the degree

13

of offense from first degree murder to second degree

14

murder.

15

Now, to come to Justice Stevens' question

16

and a question Justice White has also been asking,

17

what about cross-case review.

18

There is the beginning of that in Dillon.

19

Dillon finds that the death penalty was excessive —

20

Excuse me, that the first degree murden conviction

21

and a life sentence was excessive on the facts of the

22

Dillon case largely because of individual characteristics

23

of the defendant.

24
25

But, the court adds, and I am now reading
from 194 California Reporter, at page 420, "finally,

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

the excessiveness of defendant's punishment is underscored

2

by the petty chastisement handed out to the six other

3

youths who participated with him in the same offenses."

4

Although this was a conspiracy to commit

5

robbery and a murder in the course of it and all of

6

the coparticipants were guilty of robbery and murder

7

under California law, the Court says the one member

8

of the gang who was an adult was allowed to plead no
\

9

contest to charges of conspiracy to commit robbery

10

and all of othe other minors were simply made wards

11

of the court.

12

Says the court in short defendant received

13

the heaviest penalty provided by law while those jointly

14

responsible with him received the lightest, the proverbial

15

slap on the wrist.

16

Now, of course, this is not cross-case com­

17

parison in the sense of some other murder case, but

18

it is a beginning of comparing the death sentence with

19

other sentences, those meted out to Dillon's accomplices

20

in this offense.

21

Moreover, in the Dillon case, in a footnote,

22

26 — Again, I am referring to 194 California Reporter

23

at 413, Footnote 26, the court cites with approval

24

California Court of Appeals cases, including the Keogh

25

case and the Vargas case, which is cited in our brief

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

in Footnote 18.
The Keogh case does exactly what Justice

3

Stevens and Justice White have been asking about.

4

It engages in cross-case comparison.

S

Keogh involved a sentence of four consecutive

6

sentences for forgery as a result of which the defendant

7

ended up with a 64-year sentence.

8
9

The Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Justice
Jefferson, looked at the median term of imprisonment

10

served by forgers in California, found that few of

11

them went to jail at all and when they did it was for

12

22 to 24 months, and on that kind of a comparison proceeded

13

to invalidate, again, Justice Rehnquist, under the

14

California cruel or unusual punishment clause, the

15

Lynch clause, the punishment imposed on Keogh.

16

Now, I think it is indisputable that California

17

law goes well beyond Sollin v. Helm.

18

although it is in evolution and it is unclear exactly

19

how far it has gone so far, it goes beyond anything

20

that we need to ask for in order to get the relief

21

that we have requested in this case which is to rhave .the

22

California Supreme Court compare other death sentences

23

and life sentences in comparable cases with Harris.

24
25

QUESTION:

It goes beyond,

Mr. Amsterdam, if you are correct,

I take it it is your submission that the California

33
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

law has changed between the time that Harris' state

2

court proceedings took place and now.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

3

Justice Rehnquist, I am not

4

sure I recall that it changed.

5

of the Lynch doctrine, like any doctrine which starts

6

out with a principle and then evolves —
QUESTION:

7

There is an evolution

If it isn't an actual change,

8

why didn't the Supreme Court of California do for Harris

9

what the Ninth Circuit did for him?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

10
11

I have no idea.

That is

all we are asking for.
QUESTION:

12

Well, certainly the state of the

13

law so far as Harris versus the People are concerned

14

is probably best found in the case involving Harris

15

versus the People, isn't it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

16

The only effect of the decision

17

below is to take the case back to the California Supreme

18

Court and then they will have a chance to take a look

19

at it.
QUESTION:

20

Well, they have had one chance

21

and they have given no indication they want a second

22

chance.

23

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, I am not sure that

24

is entirely true.

They have had one chance.

There

25

has been no decision on the merits of the proportionality

2

and I don't think there can be any question, that the

3

California Supreme Court has not, on the merits, given

4

Harris proportionality review.

5

The Ninth Circuit below squarely found,

QUESTION:

What right would there be for

6

a federal court in a habeas case to send it back to

7

a state court for a matter of state law?

8

QUESTION:

None whatever.

9

QUESTION:

How could the Ninth Circuit do

10

that anyway if you were right?

11

MR. AMSTERDAM:

There is no — The reason

12

for that, Justice O'Connor, is that there are three

13

other claims in this case which the Ninth Circuit has

14

sent back to the Federal District Court for a hearing

15

on the merits.

16

in this Court by California.

17

That ruling has not been challenged

The question of why it should go back to

18

state court is why any unexhausted federal habeas petition

19

goes back to state court.

20
21

QUESTION:

But, if the Ninth Circuit passed

on it, why were they passing on an unexhausted claim?

22

MR. AMSTERDAM:

The Ninth Circuit?

23

MR. AMSTERDAM:

If this is an unexhausted

24

claim in your view, why did the Ninth Circuit consider

25

it at all?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Because there is —

You can't have it both ways.
Perhaps I misspoke myself

4

when I said an unexhausted claim.

Technically it is

5

exhausted under the technical rule of Roberts v. LaVallee.

6

We have been into the state courts.

7

as Your Honor points out, state law changed under Roberts,

8

we are still technically exhausted.

And even though,

Why the Ninth Circuit passed on the claim

10

was that the California courts had all refused to stay

that the California courts thought that he was con­

stitutionally punished?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

15

No, I don't think that is

16

so.

I think that this case, in effect, slipped between

17

the cogs in the California court system.
Harris' brief in the California Supreme Court

18
19

was filed before the California Supreme Court had decided

20

in the Jackson case that proportionality review was

21

required.

22

brief, but Frierson was only a minority opinion on

23

the question of requiring a proportionality review.
After Harris' brief was filed, Jackson was

24
25

Frierson preceded the filing of Harris'

decided.

The proportionality requirement of Frierson

became a majority requirement, and then Harris' case

2

was simply dealt with by saying we dealt with all these

3

issues in Jackson.

4

of this case at any question of whether Harris' penalty

5

fit his crime.

There was no look on the facts

I think the easiest way to see what the California

6
7

courts did was to see what they said.

The California

8

opinion in Harris' case says at the beginning, we find

9

no merit in any of these claims, but since this is

10

a death case, we are going to talk about all of the

11

issues we are to decide.

12

15 distinct questions, none of which have anything

13

to do with the fitness of the death sentence.

14

Then it goes ahead an decides

I think it is inconceivable, reading an opinion

15

like that, to say that the California courts, in fact,

16

gave Harris proportionality review.

17

Now, there is — Whether because the law

18

has changed or is changing, there is no doubt that

19

there has been an evolution over the course of the

20

term that Harris has been in the courts in California

21

law.

22

nouncements of the California Supreme Court suggests

23

that it is at least very likely that California law

24

allows Harris to review his —

he ought to have.

therefore, is whether

The decision below does nothing more than

10

send him back to the California courts and that is

11

why we have been urging that it stands Rose v. Lundy

12

on its head, it stands this Court's usual reluctance

13

to reach federal constitutional questions unnecessarily

14

on its head, for this Court to go ahead and decide

15

the Eighth Amendment issue when two things are true.

16

One, California law may give Harris what

17

he wants, and, two, the only effect of the decision

18

below is to send him back to that court to ask the

19

court to keep him alive.

20

QUESTION:

But, one of our responsibilities,

21

as well as to avoid deciding unnecessary constitutional

questions ourselves, is to see that courts of appeals

on the ground that the only relief given in fact below

look at this issue.

11

QUESTION:

12

How we could both vacate and affirm

which you have suggested in a single sentence?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

for that?

and just derail the state system.

QUESTION:

This is exhausted you tell us.

You have just said it was technically exhausted.

4

MR. AMSTERDAM:

It is technically exhausted,

5

but the policies behind the exhaustion doctrine, which

6

are that if the state court may still give relief in

7

this case, it makes no sense for the federal courts

8

to go jumping in with both feet.

9

apply.

10

Those policies still

Now, in a non-death case, the effect of the

11

application of those policies would be to give no relief

12

and simply say to the prisoner go back to state court.

13

In a death case, however, where the state

14

courts refuse to stay execution and it is imminent,

15

the federal courts may act and here is the jurisdictional

16

reason —

17

QUESTION:

And the state court refuse to

18

give relief because they have decided that his conviction

19

and his sentence are in accordance with state law and

20

the federal court is suppose to say you really don't

21

understand state law to the state courts?

22

MR. AMSTERDAM:

The federal court would only

23

act if there was a viable federal issue and the only

24

reason why it would act is to say we are not ready

25

to reach that issue because there are still state issues

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

that may resolve this case.

that, the court is confronted with the question, do

And, in a situation like

But, if the state courts refused

5

to stay his execution and reject any state law claim,

how can the federal court nevertheless sustain them

or say that you should take another look at it?

8
9

MR. AMSTERDAM:

It has to come back into

federal court in any event.

There are three other

10

issues in this case that are already in federal court

11

on the merits.

12

The question is — There are really only

13

three options to the court below and we are asking

14

this Court of approve one of them.

15

One, to let Harris die dispite the fact that

16

there are claims clearly ready for hearing in a federal

17

court and a claim that it makes sense to send back

18

to the state courts; to go ahead and adjudicate the

19

Eighth Amendment question and other questions, which

20

we do not think is appropriate; or to say we will stay

21

his execution, we will wait until the California Supreme

22

Court has clarified whether state law gives him the

23

kind of proportionality review that he is asking for,

24

and then we will take all of the federal issues at

25

once and decide them as Rose v. Lundy contemplates.

When was the Supreme Court of

California's decision, what year, affirming Harris'

conviction?

Do you remember?

4

MR. AMSTERDAM:

5

QUESTION:

8

MR. AMSTERDAM:

7

QUESTION:

When?

When, what year?
It was in — February 11, 1981.

How soon do you suppose this litigation

8

would finally become final if the courts were to follow

9

your suggestion?

10

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Harris would immediately

11

file in the California Supreme Court a request for

12

proportionality review.

13

the court below would have to begin such a process

14

in four months and it could have as much time as it

15

then wanted to reach judgment on it.

16

There is one —

17

QUESTION:

According to the decision,

May I ask a question?

I am still

18

somewhat puzzled.

In his collateral proceeding in

19

the state court, did he raise the across-the-board

20

proportionality review issue?

21

MR. AMSTERDAM:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes.

Well, then he lost in that case,

including in the California Supreme Court, did he not?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

We are talking now about

the California state habeas corpus petition?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. AMSTERDAM:

He raised it and the California

3

Supreme Court denied the petition without issuing an

4

alternative rule to show cause, which means they did

5

not get to the merits.

6

QUESTION:

But, they had an opportunity in

7

that proceeding to do precisely what the Ninth Circuit

8

has now said they should do.

9
10

MR. AMSTERDAM:

I agree.

I agree.

There is no question in the world what the

11

California Supreme Court did with this case other than

12

to say go away.

13

tending that it is clear what they did.

14

contending is simply that, since it is unclear what

15

they did, and since California law has now evolved

16

to the point where it may very well give the kind of

17

relief which we are seeking under the Eighth Amendment —

18

It is very unclear.

QUESTION:

We are not con­
What I am

But, Mr. Amsterdam, is it not true

19

that California law had so evolved by September of

20

1982, which is when — No, March of 1982, wasn't it,

21

that they denied the — the California Supreme Court

22

denied the collateral review?

23

MR. AMSTERDAM:

QUESTION:

Ah —

I mean for there to be a change

it has to be after the denial of collateral review

for it to be relevant, doesn't it?

2

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, again, California has

3

turned their sharp corners.

It is difficult looking

4

backwards to say exactly what California was or wasn't

5

at a given time.

6

time didn't go as far as Dillon does now and as far

as the cases go now, all the more reason, we think,

why the California court ought to get another crack

at it.

It is true that the cases at that

QUESTION:

You think it ought to get another

crack at reading what it does or what it might read

into the Ninth Circuit opinion about whether cross­

14

MR. AMSTERDAM:

15

We would urge, as we did

16

in the state habeas petition, that the California court

17

give that kind of cross —
QUESTION:

18

opinion that there is a federal constitutional require­

I will be glad

holding by the Ninth Circuit, what do you think the

compelled to give them proportionality review even

10

I mean they might feel

if it wasn't required under state law.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

11

The Ninth Circuit decision

12

clearly holds that it is required under the Eighth

13

Amendment whether or not it is required under state

14

law.

review.
I agree with Mr. Wellington on one point

45
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIR8T ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

which is that the place one has to look to find the

2

answer to the Eighth Amendment question is in the Gregg,

3

Proffitt, Jurek cases and that explanation of what

4

is demanded of a state — that sentencing scheme.

5

Recently this Court summed up in a very few

6

words what is demanded by saying that what is demanded

7

is that the states apply the death penalty with reason­

8

able consistency or not at all.

9

Now, the kind of review which is required,

10

we contend, by the Eighth Amendment is only so much

11

appellate review as is required to produce reasonable

12

consistency.

13

What a court needs to do is to look at the

14

facts of the case in front of it, to look at the judgments

15

and the facts of comparable cases and to ask whether,

16

in the class of case, including this one, the death

17

penalty has been so infrequently and erratically imposed

18

that the concerns of Furman are violated.

19

state seems to concede that that is necessary in its

20

reply brief.

21

And, the

The court says that — The state in its reply

22

brief says that Harris has not contended — This is

23

on page 23 — Harris has not shown and it cannot be

24

shown that either an overwhelming majority or a significant

25

minority of legislatures, courts, or juries in states

1

with capital punishment have acted to repudiate death

2

as a punishment for such crimes as Harris'.

3

There is no way in which Harris could show

4

or in which a court could find that courts and juries

5

in similar cases have repudiated the death penalty

6

unless Harris is permitted to lay in front of a court,

7

and we say the California Supreme Court, the facts

8

of his case and the judgments rendered in comparable

9

cases so that the court can ask the question, looking

10

at the pool of cases like Harris', has the death penalty

11

been so infrequently applied, so irregularly applied,

12

that the considerations which brought about this Court's

13

Furman decision apply to Harris' death sentence.

14

is all that is involved.

15

it is not some special rule, it is simply a straightforward

16

application of the requirement of this Court that con­

17

sistency in death sentencing is a pre-condition of

18

constitutional death sentences.

state courts look at all first degree murders and then

and the aggrevating circumstances in that case match

those of three, four, or five.

12

that, they say is death or is life the norm in those

other cases.

14

After they have found

Some states say it is limited to other cases

15

of first degree murder in which the same aggrevating

circumstance is found.

There isn't any one way to do it.

are very sophisticated ways to do it and very simply

ways to do it.

I would suggest that this Court has, in a
sense, done it itself.
As far as we are concerned nothing more is

23

constitutionally required than what this Court did

24

in similar judgments in Furman.

25

White's opinion in Furman said essentially I have seen

an abiding conviction, after looking at numbers of

3

these cases, that uniformity and even-handedness are

4

lacking, that some people are going to death while

5

others exactly the same live.

the federal Constitution requires a state appellate

passing through the tubes and make exactly that kind

of judgment.

All we said is that

Would it be enough for you if

to the norm here?
