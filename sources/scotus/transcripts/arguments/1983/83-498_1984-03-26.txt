ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY J. PARRILLO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. PARRILLOi

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court.

This matter is here on appeal from the Third

Circuit’s decision declaring preempted a provision of
New Jersey law which disqualifies certain labor union
officials on the basis of state prosecribed criminal or
quasi-criminal conduct from association with our casino
g a m in g

industry.
That provision, Section 93 of New Jersey's

Casino

Control Act, is but part of a larger

comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme of casino
control which is designed net only to prevent the
industry's infiltration by criminal elements or their
agents, but also to avoid any public perception that
such a

foothold is even available.
The issue the is whether New Jersey's exercise

of its police power over conduct incompatible with

No matter how great its rewards,

15

New Jersey would tolerate casino gaming only if it were

The distinction between this business of

casino gaming and useful trades and occupations is

in every aspect of casino activities, as well as those

6

ancillary enterprises and individuals involved either

7

9

Our legislature included within this latter

10

class casino hotel labor unions, because by virtue of

11

the relationship, of their relationship with the

12

licensed employees they represent, and the licensed

13

employer they collectively negotiate with, such unions

14

are positioned to exert significant control and

15

influence over the conduct of legalized casino gaming in

16

New Jersey.
Thus, Section 93 of our Casino Control Act is

Our argument

12

the essence of the reasoning in Hill on Pages 15 through

13

17 of our brief, the red brief.

We have set out

Hill was a case concerning a Florida statute

element of a very recent decision last term in Bellknap
