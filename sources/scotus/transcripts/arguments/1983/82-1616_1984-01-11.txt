Have we ever addressed the validity

7

MR. ALITO:

I don't believe the Court has.

8

But the issue decided by the Court of Appeals and that

9

we brought here was whether these statements would be

10

subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information

11

Act, assuming that they would be privileged in civil

12

discov ery.

13

Since the recognition of this privilege in the

14

Machin decision. Air Force safety investigators in

15

hundreds of cases have compared the statements made by

16

the same witnesses regarding the same accidents to these

17

two separate investigations and, not surprisingly, this

18

comparison has disclosed, human nature being what it is,

19

that the statements made to the safety board, which are

20

made under promises cf confidentiality, frequently

21

contain valuable information that is not disclosed to

22

the accident board.
Indeed, it is of course for precisely this

MR. ALITG;

I think that's unlikely, hr. Chief

Justice.

officers and commanders are required by regulation to

make all necessary technical expertise available tc both

boards.

that the questions asked by the first beard are better

than the questions asked by the second board.

Roth beards are composed of experienced rated

So I think there is no basis for concluding

And in addition, since the safety

investigation precedes the accident investigation, if

10

the safety investigator happened to ask a particularly

11

-- excuse me -- the safety investigation happened tc ask

12

a particularly good question and the witness remembered’

13

it, he might well volunteer that information when he was

14

questioned later by the accident board.
QUESTION;

15

Fr. Alito, does the record shew

16

that these witnesses whose statements are being withheld

actually were promised confidentiality?

I believe it does, Justice

Force official claims that these statements had been

I am aware there has been no factual refutation .of

that.

6

In any event, that was certainly not the basis

7

for the Court of Appeals' decision.

The Court of

Appeals* decision was certainly based on the presumption

9

that these were confidential witness statements.
The information that is contained in these

improvement in military aviation safety.

But it's

those statements under FCIA.
Let me stress at the cutset that protecting

18

documents like this would net in any way undermine the

1

purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, because at

20

least from a perspective locking forward the issue in

21

this case, unlike some Freedom of Information Act cases,

22

is not whether a certain type of information will cr

23

will net be available to the public.

24
25

We are talking here about a kind of
information that witnesses simply will not divulge

unless ccnfidentia lity is assured,, and this is

2

demonstrated by the Air Force parallel investigation

3

with almost scientific precision.

5

said, a witness to an Air Force accident is generally

6

questioned twice, first by the safety heard and then by

7

the accident board.

The accident
As I

The safety board promises

If the safety beard could net make those

9
10

premises of confidentiality, then the statements they

11

receive would be essentially the same as the statements

12

already received by the accident board and already

13

available to the public, and therefore the public wculd

14

not have any mere information than it has at present,

15

but these responsible fer military aviation safety wculd

16

have significantly less.

17

In our view, neither the lanquaqe of the

18

Freedom of Information Act ncr the statute ncr the

19

legislative history supports this senseless result.

20

First,

21

protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums cr

22

letters which wculd not be available by law tc a party

23

other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

24

what this means, as the Court has explained on a number

25

of occasions, is that exemption 5 protects those

the statutory language.

Exemption 5, of course,

documents normally privileged in civil discovery.

2

Here, as I stated, the Court cf Appeals

3

correctly assumed that these statements would be

4

privileged in civil litigation.

QUESTION:

Kr. Alito, may I ask one question.

Which of the two investigations takes place first?

7

ME. ALITC:

The safety investigation -- well,

8

let me qualify that, Justice Stevens.

9

investigations take place at essentially the same time,

The two

10

but the safety investigation has priority in examining

11

witnesses and in examining tangible evidence.
QUESTION*

12

It would seem to me -- I'm pust

13

thinking out loud -- that in response tc your argument

14

that the net result will be the same if you cut cut the

15

confidential investigation, that you'd qet the ether

16

anyway, isn't it conceivable that the second

17

investigation might omit some areas of questioning that

18

they explored in the first, that they might not have it

19

they just were starting from scratch?
ME. ALITO:

20

I don't see that there’s any

21

reason to believe that the questioning in the second

22

investigation will be appreciably different from the

23

first.

24

25

place as scon as possible after the witnesses are

released by the safety investigation.

2

that in appropriate cases witnesses have even been

3

permitted to refresh their recollection by reviewing

4

their statements to the safety investigation before they

5

testify to the accident board.

6

And I am informed

So, while of course it*s always possible that

7

two questioners will net ask the same Questions and that

8

one will omit an important question asked by the other,

9

I don’t think there’s any reason to believe that that

10
11

will occur in many instances under this setup.
QUESTION:

Do the officers who conduct the

12

accident investigation have access to the safety

13

investigation report at the time they conduct the

14

investigation?

15
16

MR. ALITO:

No.

They have access to part one

of the safety investigation.

17

QUESTION :

Just the public part?

18

MR. ALITCWhich is the public part.

And

19

they have access to a list of witnesses, so they can

confidential information.

QUESTION:

Rut they are always

Mr. Alito, at the time this Freedom

24

of Information Act suit was brought the United States

25

had not been joined as a party to the litigation brought

I believe the United States was

4

QUESTIONS

Sc that the analogy, then, if the

brought would be a kind of third party discovery,

7

whether the United States cculd have been subpoenaed to

8

9

litiga ticn?

States was not a party at the time this suit was

MB. ALITC:

10

I am not completely sure of the

11

chronology.

I believe that the requests for discovery

12

were made before the United States was dismissed, and I

13

believe the district court expressed -- I know that the

14

district court said that he was inclined to deny these

15

discovery requests.

16

pressed their discovery requests.

17

around and filed a Freedom of Information Act suit.
QUESTION:

I don’t believe that Respondents
They then turned

But the assumption of the district

19

court and the Court of Appeals was that those requests

20

would

have been properly denied?

21

MB. AIITC:

22

QUESTION:

That’s correct.
What if a witness — a witness, is

23

he subject to contempt or some penalty if he doesn’t

24

shew up?

26

Is there a subpoena power?
ME. ALITC:

There is not subpoena power.

QUESTION;

Well, is there some sanction?

What

if somebody says, I just don't want to answer that
question, it's too embarrassing?
NR. AIITC;

11

I assume there is a sanction for

12

refusal to obey a lawful order.

I could not tell you

13

exactly what the punishment would be in this instance.

14

I don't understand Respondents or the Court of

15

Appeals to have made a sericus effort to reconcile their

16

interpretation of exemption 5 with the statutory

17

language that I just discussed.

18

the statutory language to the legislative history.

19

is the heart of their argument.

Instead, they look past
That

And yet what is curious is that even there

20
21

they do not find any positive support for their

22

argument.

23

legislative history indicates that Congress meant what

24

it said when it enacted exemption 5.

25

the Senate reports state that the purpose of exemption 5

Cn the contrary, all the evidence in the

Ecth the House and

15
ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

was to protect those documents normally privileged in

2

civil discovery, and of course as I said the statements

3

here were assumed to fall into that category.

4

Mew, it's true that both reports specifically

5

mention a couple of exemptions, but there is absolutely

6

no reason to believe that those passing references were

7

intended to constitute an exhaustive list of the

8

incorporated privileges.

9

In addition to all of this,

there is even

10

specific evidence in the legislative history that

11

Congress focused on the desirability cf protectina the

12

very type of statements involved in this case.

13

hearings were held on exemption 5, that provision would

14

not have protected statements cf this sort.

15

limited to documents dealing solely with matters of lav

16

or policy.

When the

It was

At the Congressional hearings a number of

17
18

witnesses pointed out that these statements were then

19

privileged in civil discovery and should not have to be

20

disclosed.

21

protect those documents not routinely disclosed in civil

22

litigation, and Congress accomplished this by recasting

23

exemption 5 in language similar to exemption 7 as it was

24

then framed.

25

Congress thereafter amended exemption 5 to

Respondents argue that these statements must

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

nevertheless be disclosed because these facts do net

2

conclusively establish that Congress had the Hachin

3

privilege specifically in mind when it amended exemption

4

5

statutory interpretation upside-down.

6

But this argument really turns the usual rules of

Respondents are arguing that exemption 5 must

7

be construed in a way that is contrary to the

8

legislative history, not because there is positive
evidence supporting their interpretation in the

10

legislative history -- excuse me.

11

exemption 5 must be construed in a way that is flatly

12

contrary to the statutory language, and they make the

13

argument not because there is positive evidence

14

supporting that interpretation in the legislative

15

history, but because in their view the legislative

16

history fails to show with sufficient clarity that

17

Congress meant what it said.

18

They are arguing that

This is really one of the oddest methods of

1

statutory construction ever advanced.

20

this method of statutory construction is dictum in this

21

Court's decision in Kerroll.

22

dictum nor the holding in that case supports their

23

conclu sion.

24
25

The basis for

But neither the Merroll

In herroll the Court noted that it is not
clear that exemption 5 incorporates every known civil

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

discovery privilege, and the Court also observed

2

any claim that a privilege ether than the two

3

specifically noted in the legislative history was

4

incorporated into exemption 5 would have to be viewed

5

with caution.

6

that

The apparent basis for this observation as we

7

read the opinion was the recognition that Congress dealt

8

with certain civil discovery privileges in other

9

exemptions and may have intended to modify their scope.

10

But here the fcachin privilege does not substantially

11

duplicate any other FOIA exemption, and I think that it

12

is unreasonable to read the caution prescribed by

13

Herroli as requiring that exemption 5 be construed in a

14

way that is contrary both to the statutory languaae and

15

to all

16

history.

17

of the affirmative evidence in the legislative

QUESTION;

Hr. Alito, does the legislative

18

history reflect that the consideration by Congress cf

19

these safety investigations and the request for making

20

an exemption for them was addressed really to the

21

exemption 7 provisions, rather than exemption 5?

22

course, as exemption 7 turned cut it was limited tc law

23

enforcement investigations.

24
25

And of

How, would a fair reading of the legislative
history indicate that that's the context in which the

MR. ALITCs

The references by the Justice

6

that that actually supports cur argument because, as I

8

language similar to exemption 7 as it was then framed.

9

The references by the

At the time cf the hearings, both exemptions 5

QUESTIGlfi

Mr. Alito, you rely a good bit cn

the D.C. Circuit’s Machin case, don’t you?

5

ME. ALITCi

6

QUESTION*

Yes.
Am I correct in my impression that

7

there the court held that the Air Force mechanic's

8

factual statements were not privileged?

9
10

ME. ALITCi
QDESTIOHi

That’s correct, Justice Blackmun.
Hew do you distinguish that frci

11

Captain Hoover's statements here, he being an employee

12

of the Air Force?

13

ME. ALITC:

Captain Hoover was a person who

14

was involved in the accident and he made a statement

15

under promises of confidentiality, because of course he

16

had a good deal to gain or lose depending upon the

17

nature of his statements.

18

In Hachin or Machin, the Air Force mechanics

19

were people who examined the wreckage after the accident

20

took place, and what they discovered was in the nature

21

of the facts that would now be placed in part one cf the

22

safety report.

23

people who were examining the tangible evidence, and

24

they really had nothing identifiable to gain or lose by

25

shading their statements one way or the other.

They were simply disinterested technical

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

I think the court's reference to private

2

parties in that case was meant, as I think your question

3

suggests, to distinguish between the statements of

4

people who testify under pledges cf confidentiality and

5

people like the mechanics, who simply provide factual

6

information and would now be placed in part one of the

7

safety- report.

8
9

In conclusion, the statements involved here
fall within the plain language cf exemption 5.

10

Everything in the legislative history indicates that

11

Congress intended tc protect documents of this sort, and

12

requiring the disclosure of statements like this wculd

13

not serve the purposes of FCIA because it would not make

14

any more information available to the public cr to the

15

press than is available already.

16

less information for these people trying tc prevent

We therefore ask that the judgment of the

For the purposes of this
