CRAL ARGUMENT CF JOHN STEVEN CLARK, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLARK:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the state appears here as a petitioner

10

because of the importance it attaches to the resolution

11

of this case on its merits due to the split in the

12

circuits and that impact on the criminal justice

13

system.

14

defendant constitutionally entitled to specific

15

performance of a plea offer once made, then withdrawn,

16

prior to entry of a guilty plea or a showing of

17

detrimental reliance or prejudice.

That issue, as we define it, is, is the

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CLARK:

But after his acceptance.
Yes, Your Honor.

I will argue

20

that a better rule of law and a better policy is that

21

specific performance is only constitutionally entitled

22

when that defendant has made a shewing of detrimental

23

reliance or prejudice, and that there is an adequate

24

remedy at law, and that a rigid rule, the rigid rule

25

enunciated by the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals below.

3

1

has the effect of stripping the prosecutor of any

2

discretion, the trial court of any discretion, and

3

perhaps most importantly, creating a constitutional

4

right and a unilateral expectation of the defendant.
QUESTION*

5
6

Under Arkansas law, who makes the

final decision on sentences?

7

MR. CLARK*

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CLARK:

The trial court, Your Honor.
And on the acceptance of pleas?
The trial court. Your Honor, would

10

consider the plea offer that was made, and would decide

11

whether it was acceptable and either accept it or not.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CLARK:

14

He can reject it if he wishes?
Yes, sir, the trial court may

reject the offer.
The facts below briefly are these.

In 1972, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed

and defendant was appointed a counsel.

He was

arraigned, and a trial date was set.

12

prosecuting attorney his agreement, and was informed

13

there was a mistake, that the plea recommendation would

14

have to be for a sentence of 21 years consecutive rather

15

than concurrent.

The very next working day, Monday, October

defense counsel communicated to the deputy

Defense counsel or defendant had no further

16

comment to either the prosecutor or to the court until

November the 8th of that year, when the defendant

appeared before the court for trial on the charge of

with a plea of not guilty.

That trial ended in

A subsequent date was set.

It was continued, and the in February of 1973,

years consecutively.

MR. CLARK:

And served how much time?
Defendant was sentenced in 1970

11

and *71, and was released in 1977, I believe —

12

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

13

'79,

And the sentence he had been given

14

was a total of how many years?

15

MR. CLARK:

For the charge of burglary and

16

assault with intent to kill, 21 years for burglary and

17

12 for assault with intent to kill, and that was the

18

sentence he was served.

QUESTION;

But it does have to be approved by

the judge?
HR. CLARK;

5

The trial court must approve any

6

plea that has been offered to a defendant.

7

has recognized that plea bargaining is an inherent part

8

of that criminal justice process, and inherent in any

plea bargaining agreement is the requirement of

fundamental fairness.

11

In Santobellc this Court enunciated that a

12

defendant was only entitled to specific performance

13

where there had been that showing of detrimental

14

reliance or prejudice.

15

been no showing of reliance or prejudice, and

16

fundamental fairness requires that the benefit inure

equally to the state as it does to the defendant.

Your Honor.

18

between the man and the prosecutor.

Yes, Your Honor.
That is what Santobello is about,

and that is what this case is about, and I'm not too

Tour Kcncr/ I would submit tc you

3

that Santobello does help in the sense that unless the

4

defendant shows there has been some detrimental reliance

5

or some prejudice.

shew that.

In this instance, the defendant was offered

7

a bargain.

There was a mistake, an honest mistake.
As soon as that offer was accepted and

there was a mistake. At that point, the defendant

13

of not

16

prosecutor of vindictiveness, just indicated that there

18

guilty. The defendant did not raise at any time

In fact, I think the mistake is fairly

19

self-evident if you logically conclude what occurred.

20

Here was the defendant serving 21 years for burglary and

21

12 years for assault with intent to kill, doing time.

22

He had been tried once for murder in the first degree,

23

convicted, and sentenced to life.

24

state coming forward with a plea bargain which said you

25

could serve 21 years concurrent.

9

Now, here was the

It would have been as

1

if the deputy prosecutor had said, would you accept a

2

plea bargain in which we will drop all charges against

3

your defendant.
And so I think it is obvious from the logical

4
5

conclusion that there was a mistake here, and that in

6

this instance the defendant was not prejudiced by that

7

mistake, because he did have an adequate remedy, which

8

was trial by jury.
QUESTION*

9

General Clark,

the Court of Appeals

10

seems to have concluded that the writ of habeas corpus

11

should issue unless the state resentenced the defendant

12

in accordance with the concurrent sentence plea

13

proposal.

14

nothing of the fact that the trial judge in Arkansas had

15

never approved the plea bargain?

Do you know why the Court of Appeals made

ME. CLARK*

16

Ycur Kcncr, I do not know why they

17

did not.

That is the issue that brings the state to

18

this petition, for the reason that that erodes all

19

discretion of the trial judge.

20

inflexible rule that there is nc benefit, no mutuality

21

of advantage that goes and flows to the state from plea

22

bargaining for the very reason that you are bound cnly

23

to the unilateral expectation of the defendant, and that

24

there is some mutuality of advantage that is a part of

25

the plea bargaining process that inures to the state.

10

It is such a rigid,

1

QUESTION*

But what if the Court of appeals,

2

instead cf saying what it did,

3

submits the plea bargain to the judge who tried the

4

case,

5

judge.

6

object ionable, ,isn ’ t it?

7

it said, until the state

saying the prosecutor is bound but not the trial
Would you still — Under your theory it is still

MR. CLARK*

Yes, Your Honor, it is still

8

objectionable.

That obviously is a better remedy than

9

what we have new, but it is still objectionable, because

10

of the split in the circuits and the fact that

11

predicated on this unilateral expectation of the

12

defendant, and I think we find a situation where two

13

disastrous results occur, the first of which is that we

14

have given rise to a constitutional right to a defendant

15

who has been engaged in the plea negotiation process,

16

which this Court has enunciated that plea bargaining is

17

not a constitutional right.

18

So, for those defendants that are not involved

19

in the plea negotiation process, they don’t have the

20

same issue to bring to an appellate — for an appellate

21

remedy cf post-convicticn remedy.

22

of depending solely on the unilateral expectations cf

23

defendant can create a situation where literally each

24

case on its merits will have to be reviewed through the

25

post-ccnviction remedy and appellate process without

11

Secondly, the effect

1

being able to set a standard by which they can be judged

2

against, because each defendant will have some

3

expectation, I didn’t believe that I was going to be

4

sentenced to 21 years consecutive, and you get into this

5

Court having to ask of events of five, ten, and fifteen

6

years age, what did one deputy prosecuting attorney say

7

to one deputy public defender?

8

the five to seven minute conversation?

9

happens if the defense counsel makes a mistake?

What was the context of
What in fact

So it seems to me that the decision below was

10
11

a very

12

flexibility of fundamental fairness as it applies to the

13

criminal justice system, and as I have said there would

14

be no benefit that would have flown to the state if you

15

follow the strict adherence of the court below, because

16

Johnson would not be serving any time for the crime of

17

murder.

18

important decision in that it erodes the

And although the court below says it does not

19

rely on principles of contract, it does seem to adhere

20

to some contracting theory in the sense that there is an

21

offer and there was an acceptance, and therefore the

22

state should be bound.

23

discussing here are not issues of contract, and though

24

the analogy may be important from the standpoint of

25

being somewhat instructive, we are dealing with

I submit to you that what we are

12

1

constitutional rights.

2

QUESTION ;

General Clark, just so I understand

3

your position, in this particular case you say it would

4

have been silly to make this offer, because it really

5

was no punishment at all.

6

MR. CLARK;

7

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
But you would make the same

8

constitutional argument if they had offered him 15 years

9

instead of life or something like 15 years consecutive

10

and then later changed their mind and decided it ought

11

to be 21 years consecutive.
MR. CLARK;

12

Yes,

sir, I would make the same

13

argument if you withdraw the plea if no prejudice had

14

attached, there- had teen no detrimental reliance.
I would also to this Court that as I said,

15
16

that the result of this decision in terms of contract is

17

one which this — we are talking about constitutional

18

rights and the deprivation of liberty, and that if you

19

were just going to analogize simply to contract, where

20

one party negotiates with another, you realize that both

21

parties have the power to enforce that agreement, and in

22

this instance the criminal defendant has the right to

23

withdraw that plea, even though there has been a bargain

24

struck.

25

The offense to the dignity of the state in

13

terirs cf prosecution and the very narrow rigid rule
applied by the Eighth Circuit is this.
situation.
years,

Had the prosecutor offered

Take this
20 years, 25

to be specific, and the defender had heard only

five and communicated that five-year offer to his
defendant, he would have said, I accept, would have
communicated back to the prosecuting attorney, we accept
the plea of five years, but in fact it should have teen
communicated to the one who originally made the offer,
who was out sick, to a second one, and they agreed.
And then the prosecution went forward to take
a statement from the defendant showing some reliance on
his part in which he perhaps implicated other
accessories to this crime.

Then in fact only at the

time that we appeared before the bar of justice of the
court at the trial court level would we find the
situation where the defendant could have raised the
issue cf he had unilaterally expected a five-year
sentence instead of a 25-year sentence, and his
expectation was predicated on the argument of his
defense counsel, the mistake there, and that if you
follow the rule of the Eighth Circuit below and its
rigid application, you could contend that that bargain
must be struck, and in fact that defendant is entitled
to that when the mistake was not made by the government

14

1

whatsoever
The argument also has been made that the

2
3

government must act scrupulously.

If you can't trust

4

the government, who can you trust?

5

better policy, of course, is that in any plea bargaining

6

situation between the prosecution and the defense, every

7

offer and agreement should be made, but the fact also is

8

that we do not deal with technical precision.

9

make mistakes.

Well, in fact, the

People do

And the trust of the defendant is net

10

based

really in the prosecutor, because the prosecutor

11

is the defendant's advocate.

12

is predicated in his belief in the court.

The trust of the defendant

And so therefore the decision below does not

13
14

fashion an adequate remedy in the sense of mutuality of

15

advantage that it could gain through the plea bargaining

16

process, because the court needs the discretion to

17

review these plea bargaining negotiations and then

18

order,

19

which gives that defendant an adequate remedy, which is

20

trial by jury.

one, specific performance or, two, recision ,

21

Excuse me, Your Honor.

22

I think it is important from the perspective

23

of the state to indicate that unless we have a standard

24

enunciated by this Court, a standard which indicates

25

that without some showing of bad faith, without some

15

1

showing cf detrimental reliance, that we have an

2

unworkable triple justice system in which the state must

3

function, because virtually in the calendar year 1983

4

just in the United States District Courts alone there

5

were some 35,000 defendants who plead guilty or nolo to

6

criminal charges.
Of that number, some 29,000 -- excuse me, were

7

8

charged with criminal offenses.

9

29,000

Of that number, some

either pled guilty or in fact pled nolo.

So you

10

have 30,000 out of 35,000 coming into the system by

11

virtue cf plea bargaining and the negotiation process,

12

and a mutuality of advantage must flow to the state.

13

must flow to the state or the state finds itself

14

continually in litigation as tc the expectation cf the

15

def end ant.

It

The remedy that the state would beseech this

16
17

Court and urge this Court to give is that standard, the

18

shewing of bad faith, the shewing of seme detrimental

19

reliance, and that that is not just mistake, because

20

mistake is not enough in that if you follow just mistake

21

there is no punishment, for instance, in this case at

22

bar, that would flow to the defendant, and no respect

23

for the dignity of the people cf the state of Arkansas

24

for an offense committed against its dignity and its

25

citize nry.

16

I would conclude. Your Honor, by simply saying

1

I
2

this.

Fundamental fairness and mutuality of advantage

3

of plea bargaining require that a punishment must fit

4

the crime, that the state must have the ability to deal

5

equally and dispose of cases quickly, and deal equally

6

with the defendant in the plea bargaining process, and

7

that to protect the rights of the citizenry of our

8

state, the defendant is not entitled tc any specific

9

performance of a plea bargain made and

then withdrawn

10

unless that defendant has in fact demonstrated that

11

there has been some detrimental reliance or some

12

pre jud ice.
If there are no further questions of the

13

Court.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD J. GAN ZFRIED, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF CF THE U.S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

20

MR. GANZFRIED*

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.

22

In our view, the Court of Appeals incorrectly

23

magnified the respondent's unilateral expectations into

24

a constitutional -- a protected constitutional right.

25

Since the federal courts, of course, have no general

17

1

supervisory power over the state courts in criminal

2

cases,

3

limited to correcting constitutional violations, and it

4

is cur submission that such questions arise only when

5

the defendant's reliance on a plea agreement

6

substantially induces his waiver of a right protected by

7

the Constitution,

the role of this Court in a habeas proceeding is

Ordinarily such an issue will not arise until

8
9

a defendant pleads guilty, but if the prosecutor

10

breaches his bargain after that, Santobello teaches that

11

a remedy may be appropriate, that the defendant would be

12

entitled to relief, and the reasorj is that where the

13

bargain is a material inducement to the plea, the

14

knowing and voluntary nature of the plea is called into

15

question.

16

Now, admittedly, there may be some cases where

17

similar concerns would arise prior to the plea, where

18

the defendant has detrimentally relied on the bargain,

19

for example, by cooperating with ongoing investigation,

20

but the same principle applies here, too.

21

would be entitled to seme kind of relief only because

22

his reliance on the agreement undermines the knowing and

23

voluntary waiver of a protected constitutional right,

24

and that is the privilege against self-incriminaticn.

25

QUESTION;

The defendant

In your view of Arkansas law, at

18

1

what point could the defendant have withdrawn his

2

participation and said, I have changed ray mind,

3

to go to trial?

MR. GANZFRIED:

QUESTION:

6

MR. GANZFRIED:

I want

Any time.

Any time up to when?
As I understand it, certainly

7

any time up through the entry of his plea of guilty, and

8

in fact I think under the current rules in Arkansas he

9

could

move to withdraw his plea after the plea had teen

10

tendered but before sentence had been passed by the

11

court.
QUESTION:

12

May I ask if your emphasis on

13

detrimental reliance and prejudice means that it is sort

14

of an estoppel theory?

15

if the other party relies?
MR. GANZERIED;

16

Cf course,

The prosecutor becomes estopped

Nell, it could be put in those

17

terms.

18

promissory estoppel, the reliance by the other side, of

19

course, has to be reasonable and justified , and in the

There has to be a right at stake.

MR. GANZFRIED:

Frankly, in terms of the

constitutional vocabulary, to move aside from the

bring in the reliance, it strikes me that your analogy

is really sort cf an estoppel analogy.

and generally when I use the term "detrimental reliance"

This Court has held that a defendant has no

The point is that he has no

He has no right to have a guilty

MR. GANZFRIED;

Well, certainly in the federal

2

courts, and in Arkansas as well, it is up to the court

3

ultimately to decide whether that plea is acceptable and

4

that bargain is acceptable.

5

Court of Appeals, what prosecutors are going to have to

6

do to protect themselves is that they are going to have

7

to possibly conduct all negotiations on the record, and

8

as a result, they would remove much of the flexibility

9

that now benefits defendants as well as the state.

New, under the rule of the

Another possibility is that plea proposals may

10
11

be couched with so many con tingencies that they are

12

virtually meaningless.

13

negotiations will be delayed until so late in the

14

process that the benefits of prompt disposition would be

15

lost to prosecutors and defendants, because, after all,

16

in Arkansas and presumably in the Eighth Circuit, the

17

prosecutor is going to be concerned that a slip of the

18

tongue may bind him to something that he never intended

19

to say, and that the other side never tcok him -- and

20

relied on.

Another possibility is that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD QUIGGLE, ESQ.,

25

AFFCINTED BY THIS CCUFT

26

1

2

MR. QUIGGLEi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Ccurt.

3

I believe that the facts of this case do net

4

warrant the broad ruling that the state seeks, that even

5

if this Court finds that the Eighth Circuit's holding is

6

broader than the Eighth Circuit perceived it to be, and

7

therefore this Court decides tc enter a very bread

8

ruling, it should certainly not be that the state is

9

allowed to play fast and loose with the bargaining

10

process until it decides it has gotten the kind cf

11

penalty it wants.
QUESTION:

12

Dc you agree with your friend that

13

the defendant may withdraw at any time up to the time

the Court acts on the plea and possibly even

That is -- well, in fact, the

bargain, Your Honor, that was finally struck was that it

would be 21 years consecutive as opposed to 21 years

12

that that would have resulted in no additional penalty

Court of Appeals did more than specifically enforce the

-- it bound the trial judge to the plea agreement in a

way that he would never have been bound under the terms

of the agreement.

MR. QDIGGLE:
QUESTION*

I think that's correct.

Do you feel you could justify that

in any way?
MR. QUIGGLE*

les, Ycur Honor, I think I can,

because this case, even the habeas case has been pending
a long time, and these facts are very stale, and my
client has already served the enhanced agreement.

It

would simply not be fair to my client to place him in
the jecpardy of the trial court now perhaps rejecting
that plea bargain.

That has nothing to do with the

theory of your case, dees it?

I mean, it is just kind

of throwing yourself on the mercy of the court.
MR. QUIGGLE*

Well, I guess it is, in a sense,

Your Hcncr, but of course I will say that this issue was
not brought up to the Eighth Circuit, and therefore
their opinion does not address it at all, and I am
somewhat at a disadvantage to justify their thinking

QUESTION;

Mr. Quiggle, under Arkansas

14

practice, if the agreement had been -- there had been no

15

misunderstanding and no change, and had been submitted

16

to the court, would there have been a recommendation by

17

the prosecutor that that be entered?

18

MR. QUIGGIE;

Absolutely, Your Honor, and the

19

fact of the matter is, even unto this day trial courts

20

in Arkansas routinely, if net -- and consistently take

21

those recommendations.

22

one in Arkansas, and that was certainly true back when

23

the plea would have been entered in this case had the

24

government not reneged on its word.

by his word.

The trial court can always reject it.

And I don’t perceive the Eighth Circuit --

14
15

that’s

16

think this is a proper case for any kind of broad

17

ruling, because it has got seme screwy facts in it, and

18

there is also the aspect of this case that I think makes

19

it difficult — my position difficult here is that there

20

is ineffectiveness proven in the record, and there is

21

ineffectiveness claimed as to the trial counsel for not

22

going forward to enforce the plea.

23

why I continue to make the point that I don’t

He states in the hearing that there was simply

24

nothing he could do.

New, I presume that a deputy

25

prosecuting attorney knows the law, and Santobellc had

32

1

been decided several months at that point, but those

2

issues were not reached by the Eighth Circuit, sc I

3

don't mean to rely on or press it on this Court heavily

4

at this time, but the fact is, there is a lot of

5

uncertainty built into this opinion, I believe, and

6

therefore I don't think it's the kind of a case upon

7

which a broad ruling should depend.
If there is one, I just think it is that the

8
9

prosecutor cannot make his word in a final sense, as

10

here,

where there was an offer that was clear on its

11

face, and I disagree with the state when they say that

12

it is really simple, it is really logical to figure cut

13

what happened here.

14

put on any proof about that?

15

at all in this case.

If that is true, why didn't they
They offered no witnesses

None.

The fact is, if one wants to speculate, which

16
17

is all

18

motivations, I submit to you that it is equally logical

19

and perhaps a let mere believable that this prosecutor

20

meant exactly what he said when he offered 21 years

21

concurrent, and the supervisor found out about it and

22

overruled him, because the facts of this case, as are

23

clearly seen from the Eighth Circuit's opinion, were

24

shocking, where a father kills his own daughter.

25

the state can dc, abcut the prosecutor's

There was lots of press.

33

The Court will

1

recall

there was a mistrial because of the press.

2

the plea was rejected there were collateral civil

3

lawsuits filed in this matter, and I think, the

4

prosecutor was taking a lot of heat, and consequently he

5

said no, we can’t — we are going to have to get more

6

time out of this guy, the deputy prosecutor’s superior.

7

And I think under the facts —
QUESTION :

After

When was this told to the

defend ant?
MR. QUIGGLEs

10

Your Honor, I don't think it was

11

for some months, until after the plea was rejected,

12

because it was set down for a hearing that was

13

continued, and then they came back and had the mistrial

14

that I mentioned just a second ago, and I believe that

15

it was

17

been rejected.

18
19
20

net until they commenced that trial that my

QUESTION;

There is nothing in the record

about it one way or the other?
MR. QUIGGLE;

It is not clear from the record,

21

Your Honor, but I will say that the prosecutor, the

22

deputy prosecutor who was assigned to the case after the

23

plea was withdrawn by the state admitted that he did not

24

contact Mr. Johnson until shortly before the time of the

25

hearing where the mistrial occurred, and so I think

34

1

presumably that encompasses the fact that he did net

2

communicate the withdrawn plea.

3

The facts are very specific about how the

4

original offer was made, and I think that they would

5

have been equally specific had this been communicated.

6

I think if the Court does consider this matter

7

in the broad sense that the state seeks, that it must

8

give due consideration to the state's argument that the

9

Sixth Amendment does net apply in situations like this,

10

because I think clearly it does apply.

11

for example, as a trial counsel in a criminal matter, if

12

my client has admitted that he is guilty, and is ready

13

to plead, I believe that that is going to have a

14

profound impact upon that defendant if he then is forced

15

to go to trial.

16

I think that,

It is certainly going to have a profound

17

impact on me or any other criminal attorney if I have to

18

put that man on the stand.

19

difficult to do so.

20

awkward ethical position, because probably he is going

21

to have to take the stand and lie.

22

that the Court must be very cautious in waving aside the

23

state's argument that — or my contention that the Sixth

24

Amendment is very important in this case.

25

I think it would be very

I think it places counsel in a very

6

instance where a defendant, as here, would have to take

7

the stand in order to make their case, I believe that it

8

does —
QUESTION :

9
10

Would it be any different before or

after?
MR. QUIGGLEs

11

Well, Your Honor,

I presume that

12

before the defendant has not conceded his guilt to

13

anyone, and in the face of these kinds of facts, in

14

fact,

15

the defendant has said, yes, I am guilty.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that that would

16

be the first time that the defense counsel became aware

17

of the reality?

18

ME. QUIGGLEs

It certainly would probably be

19

the first time under normal practice,

20

Your Honor, that a defense counsel was told by the

21

defendant literally, I am guilty.

22

I would think,

I would just like to say one more thing, and

23

that is that I don't see the Eighth Circuit establishing

24

a prophylatic rule here.

25

decision was tailored only to the facts of this

I think the Eighth Circuit's

36

1

particular case, and it was very narrowly drawn, and

2

therefore I don’t helieve that it impinges upon the

3

criminal process in the way that the state perceives,

4

but if it does, it should impinge such that the

5

prosecution must deal honestly and fairly and abide by

6

its word.
