ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN M. PALMER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PALMERs

t
please

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

the Court;
We're going to first direct cur attention to

11

the appealability issue and for -- in discussing that I

12

am going to assume for the moment, but only the moment,

13

that we have raised a valid double jeopardy claim.

14

Now the government disputes the appealability

15

of this claim under Abney on the theory that the

16

so-called second prong of the Cohen test is not met.

17

The government suggests that because we address the

18

merits of the claim it's not collateral.

19

Now realistically it would appear to us that

20

we have both been circling the issue and it was only

21

recently that — in the Flanagan case that Justice

22

O'Conner brought us back, I believe, to the original

23

understanding of the matter, and it is this;

24

Flanagan case the Court said it is not collateral if

25

it’s not independent of the issues to be tried.

In the

Its

2

is complete.

And again in MacDonald, discussing the speedy

4

trial claim, the Court sai^1

between the claim and the events at trial".

6

boils down to the following;

7

to look at the events of trial to determine the claim,

8

it is indeed collateral.

9

course, is something we seek to avoid.

"there needs to be a divorce
To us this

that if there be no need

And in this case the trial, of

We have an extant record of the first trial,

10
11

which,

we say, shows clear insufficiency of the

12

evidence, and that is why the Chief Justice in Abney

13

said that the very nature of a double jeopardy claim

14

such that it is collateral and independent to the

15

principal issues to be tried, and we think in that light

16

there is no question but all three prongs of the Cohen

17

test have been met.

18

Now --

19

QUESTION;

20

New Abney came up in a somewhat

different posture than this case, didn't it?
NR. PALNER;

21

Yes, sir.

Your Honor,

22

unquestionably, but the posture in which it arose does

2

QUESTION:

But why do you have to assume tha

3

validity of your claim in order to determine its

4

appealability?
KB. PALMER:

5

Well, because if it’s not a

6

doubla jeopardy violation, we're out of court.

7

no interlocutory appeal.
QUESTION:

10

There’s

Yes, but presumably you'll never

know whether there is a double jeopardy violation until
you gat a determination on the merits on appeal.

11

MR. PALMER:

12

QUESTION:

Well —
I mean, there’s a circularity about

13

it, I suppose, from both sides.

14

MR. PALMER:

Well, as we indicated, it’s a

15

self-determining claim.

16

of tha evidence, when the government fails at a criminal

17

trial

18

raises a collateral bar, that it has no right to a

19

second bite of the apple.

20

When you say the insufficiency

to prove enough to go to the jury, we say that

Now indeed in determining that,

the same claim

21

of insufficiency, you must look at the record, the

22

evidence adduced, to determine whether cr not the

23

violation has occurred, but that is separate.

24
25

QUESTION:

But that assumes a view of the law

of doable jeopardy that is certainly not necessarily

simply has not ceased

4

MR. PALMER*

I mean, it

that so long as it's a hung jury the jeopardy
to attach.

Well, that gets us to the next

5

question, whether it is double jeopardy or not, whether

6

there is jeopardy, and that's why I assumed for the

7

first argument that it was, because the government now

8

makes the claim that it isn’t.

9

Now -- but I think if it is double jeopardy,

10

if wa have a right to avoid a retrail, if the evidence

11

was insufficient at the first trial, then I think Abney

12

clearly applies.

13

clearly met.

14

All three prongs of the test are

Now I think the question that Your Honor is

15

addressing is you have trouble with visualizing or

16

conceptualizing this as a true double jeopardy claim,

17

and that takes us to the next question.

18

Court of Appeals --

Prior in the

When you say a "true double

mistrial context, that it's double jeopardy.

QUESTION:

Well, the Courts of Appeals may

20

agree on that, but I don't think that this Court has

QUESTION:

every case where a jury cannot agree the defendant is

dismis sed?

MR. PALMER:

Of course not, Your Honor.

Then you say that's the end of the

MR. PALMER;

Oh, no, not at all, Your Honor.

10

I am saying that really enables us to present our claim

11

of double jeopardy, which is grounded in the notion that

12

in this particular —

13
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Palmer, I thought I heard you

say —

15

MR. PALMER;

16

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
You’re limiting your argument to

17

situations in which the trial judge has made an error in

18

submitting the case to the jury because there was

19

insufficient proof by the prosecution.

20

MR. PALMER;

21

QUESTION;

22

25

To get the prosecution to the jury;

is that what you're saying?
MR. PALMER;

23
24

Yes.

Yes, it should never get to the

jury.
QUESTION;

And it's in that situation where he

9

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

makes the error and there's a hung jury that you say you

2

make your argument for double jeopardy?

3

ME. PALMER*

Solely in that limited context.

4

And the last case reversed —

5

QUESTION

But, Mr. Palmer, have you ever seen

6

a criminal case where the defense attorney didn't make a

7

motion at the conclusion of the state's case to dismiss

8

for insufficient evidence?
MR. PALMER*

10

QUESTIONS

Yes.
Well, I haven't, and I have sat on

11

many, and what you're really talking about here is

12

setting up the possibility, at least, of making Federal

13

habeas claims in every state prosecution that might end

14

in a hung jury based on the insufficiency of the

15

evidence claimed.
It isn't that you're going to win all of

16
17

those,

18

extended delay and difficulty as a result of it if

1

you're correct.

20

but it certainly would afford opportunities for

Isn't that right?

MR. PALMER:

Well, it may be in the habeas

21

corpus context that if the government has failed in its

22

proof it has no right to retry somebody.

23

QUESTION;

Well, even if you're right, the

24

point is I guess we have to be a little bit concerned

25

with the administration of the system and with seeing to

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

it that maybe state prosecutions can go on and finish

2

their course before we start the Federal habeas review.

3

So what I'm concerned about is whether it's reasonable

4

to say

that double jeopardy just never matures as long

5

as the

jury hasn't come in with a verdict in the first

6

trial.
Maybe it just never matures to the point that

7
8

you can make your appeal.

9

MR. PALMERi

Well, insofar as the states are

10

concerned, we’re just talking here about a Federal

11

statute and the appealability thereunder.

12

probably could provide a rule that they could not be

13

appealed on that ground until after the second trial or

14

conviction and, therefore, habeas would be

15

inappropriate.

That could be an alternative.

QUESTION;

16

The states

Well, but I suppose what we decide

17

here will certainly be governing what happens on Federal

18

habeas from state prosecutions.
QUESTION;

19

Under your most recent answer, Mr.

20

Palmer, can the state statutes limit the right of

21

Federal habeas corpus petitioners?
MR. PALMER;

22

23
24
25

Oh, I don't believe it can, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, then in every case, in every

case in a stats court, even though here we have a

2

in a state case automatically that would be a habeas

3

4

be performing the function of the state appellate

5

process to determine the issues you raised.

MR. PALMER:

Well, I don’t know the context of

9

rush into Federal District Court.

10

I would assume that the states could make a

11

rule if they wanted to provide by statute you could

12

raise the claim, but only upon appeal from the

13

conviction, and I think that would — in that sense —

14

QUESTION:

Well, anyway under the habeas

Correct.
Well, how did you happen to raise

it now?
MR. PALMER:

Well, I'll show you.

If the

14

defendant were convicted and the evidence were

15

insufficient, as in this case, we allege, the conviction

16

must be overturned and a direction for an acquittal

17

because the evidence was insufficient.

18

Now it is our theory that just because he was

1

not convicted and the jury came a step closer to the

20

direct result, because the evidence is insufficient they

21

were erroneous in convicting him.

22

came a step closer to the correct result and moved

23

toward an acquittal should not preclude him -- why

24

should he be in a worse position because the jury came

25

closer to the correct result than because it erred

2

Cur point is that regardless of what the jury

does this evidence is insufficient and the government,

reprosecute him.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-0300

1

that all of the double jeopardy cases, from this Court,

2

at least -- and you correct me if I'm wrong -- have not

3

allowed a double jeopardy claim as a bar to a second

4

trial unless there has been a judgment terminating the

5

first trial.

6

And you're really relying on a hypothetical

judgment that's never been entered, namely you're

contending that the judge should have granted your

We’re just saying in this limited context that

14

Why should the result be different if the same --

everything is equal, the same evidence has been

presented, nothing changes, all facts being equal except

the jury instead of convicting, the same result — he

1

There has been no final judgment in this case

2

because the jury was unable to reach a verdict.

issue is whether retrial must be postponed to allow

Petitioner to appeal the District Court's order denying

his motion to acquit for insufficiency of the evidence.

6

The Court of Appeals dismissed for want of appellate

'T’he

that the order is not appealable because it does not

10

fall within the collateral order exception to the final

11

judgment rule as this Court has described in its cases;

12

second, Petitioner's claim does not in any event sound

13

in double jeopardy and thus the -- there is no

14

possiblity of a bar to retrial under these

15

circumstances; and, third, that an examination of the

16

details of Petitioner's claim reveals that his actual

17

complaint was with the trial judge's ruling on a matter

18

of receipt of evidence and not even insufficiency as we

strongly that his claim does not sound in double

4

Well, Justice O'Conner

I just don't understand your

NR. McCONNELL*

rirst of all, it's not a

first trial can be anything but collateral to everything

12

that gees on at an entirely new trial.

13

MR. McCONNELL;

Justice O'Conner, it is not a

14

collateral because a decision is a decision on the

15

merits, as this Court determined in Burks.

determines that the evidence was insufficient, that is

the equivalent, operative equivalent, as the decision

If the Court

It is in fact a

And that is the principal

Now it's true that in Flanagan and in

22

MacDonald this Court extended the concept of being

23

non-collateral to issues which were not as directly

24

related to guilt or innocence as this and as it is in

25

this case, and for those — in those cire urnstances it is

32
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

true that looking to whether the issue is one that needs

2

to be decided upon the full record of the case is a

3

useful test in deciding whether it is so enmeshed in the

4

factual merits of the case that it is not appealable,

5

even though in fact, as in the case of disqualification

6

of counsel, it has nothing logically to do with guilt or

7

innoca nee.

8
9

But in a case like this, where the question is
sufficiency of the evidence, which is the very heart of

10

the merits of the case, there can be no question that

11

the decision was collateral.

12

QUESTION;

But sufficiency of the evidence at

13

a trial that’s already taken place, isn't there

14

something to what Justice O'Conner says, that anything

collateral to the second trial?

Justice White, there are cases

does not apply at all where there are mistrials because

of hung juries and where upon an appeal from the

judgment in the second trial the Courts of Appeals have

entertained the issue of whether a directed verdict

should have been granted in the first trial.

interests are of the government in this case.
10

Our interests in this case are to enable us to

11

engage in prompt retrials at the conclusion of

12

mistrials, especially hung juries.

13

whether an appellate court would be able to reverse on

14

the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence in a

15

first trial upon appeal from a conviction in the second

16

trial is a question of very little practical import to

17

the government, largely, incidentally, because that

18

question is going to be as a matter of practical fact

essentially the same as the question of whether the

Now --

3

QUESTION:

hr. McConnell, if one were to adopt

4

Judge Scalia’s position in the Court of Appeals that

5

jeopardy does not cease to attach merely by a hung jury,

6

then as a matter of double jeopardy law there would be

7

no occasion to review the evidence at the first trial

8

following the second trial if the first trial resulted
in a hung jury, as you have here.

10

ME. HcCONNELIi

11

QUESTION ;

12

That's correct.

And does the government agree or

disagree with Judge Scalia's position?
MR. McCDNNELL:

13

We agree that that's true as a

14

matter of double jeopardy law, which lays aside,

15

incidentally, the question of whether the Court would be

16

able to review that as a matter of one of the many

17

issues which are simply merged in the judgment of the

18

second

1

— of the second trial.
The fact that many courts have found that they

20

are able to reach the issue in the civil context

21

suggests that the question remains open.

22

the Court to resolve that question here because we

23

don't — we think it's a fairly difficult question of

24

very limited, at least to us, practical importance.

25

We don't ask

But we're extremely concerned about the

43

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 620-0300

1

prospect of mistrials being interrupted by appellate

2

processes before we’re able to engage in the retrial as,

3

incidentally, the Speedy Trial Act requires.

4

would

5

schedule the retrial while the evidence is still fresh,

6

while the witnesses are still available, and while the

7

public’s interest in justice can still be vindicated

8

reasonably promptly.

9

We

-- we are quite interested in being able to

And our concern with this case is that it

10

provides the opportunity for a notice of appeal to

11

interrupt those processes in virtually every case that

12

ends in a mistrial, because as a matter of practice a

13

motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis of

14

insufficiency of the evidence is made in virtually every

15

criminal case.

16

And that will then involve the appellate court

17

in what can be a very burdensome operation of reviewing

18

the entire record to find out whether the evidence was

19

sufficient, incidentally an effort which they're going

20

to have to go through upon review of the conviction in

21

the second trial anyway.

22

in minor ways be different, the double expenditure of

23

effort is not one that should be overlooked.

trial error as well, because if Petitioner is correct,

22

then whenever the trial — the state courts have

reversed for trial error, even, incidentally, where they

24

have reached and affirm the sufficiency of the evidence,

25

it will be open to a petitioner, to a defendant to take

this claim to the Federal habeas court claiming that if

2

in fact those courts had errei that to retry him would

3

violate the double jeopardy clause.

4

This is in fact exactly what happened in the

5

case of Delk v. Atkinson, where the State Supreme Court

6

reversed the conviction, expressly finding that the

7

evidence was sufficient to justify going to the jury.

8

The Federal habeas court blocked retrial, disagreeing

9

with the State Court on the issue of sufficiency.

10

The Court of Appeals then agreed that the

11

District Court had jurisdiction to act in that fashion,

12

but found that the State Court had been right back in

13

the first place on the issue of sufficiency, thus

14

allowing a retrial if, after all those proceedings, the

15

evidence was still available to permit a retrial in any

event.

It's this kind of squander of appellate

resources and of the ability to retry that we’re so

/

The issue

In Burks it stated that an issue of the receipt

It's not one that goes to guilt or innocence
and thus under Burks would not lead to preclusion of

10

retrial, which makes a great deal of sense because,

11

after all, when it’s a matter of trial error the

12

government's right to one full opportunity under proper

13

legal principles to obtain a conviction has not

14

obtained, and for the same reasons that the government

15

can retry after any other trial error, it ought to be

16

able to do so.

19

QUESTION:

And for the same reason after such

rulings you can't go to Federal habeas.
MR. McCONNELL:

That's correct.

And we

20

believe that the -- we see no exceptions in any of the

21

cases of this Court that would lead one to believe that

22

such a claim would bar retrial and thus again it does

23

not sound in double jeopardy and should not be allowed

24

as a matter for interlocutory appeal or, in the state

25

context, a Federal habeas.

general jurisdiction judges, as against about 300

8

Federal judges who would be involved as we are here.

9

MR. McCONNELL*

I think Your Honor is

10

perfectly correct in anticipating the practical problems

11

with an opposite holding becauee were our position not

12

correct and were the position of this Court in Tateo and

13

Burks not correct, it would effectively convert every

14

reversal on a matter of evidentiary admission into a

15

question of sufficiency of the evidence, thus opening up

16

habeas relief prior to retrial in hundreds or thousands

17

of state cases.

It would be a phenomenal result.

They were not combined and

for judgment of acquittal was repeated three times.

This is all --

You just fudge them both together

MR. McCONNELL;

No, Your Honor.

I think that

9

for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction they ought to

10

be looked at, the two motions -- the motion for judgment

11

of acguittal and the motion to bar retrial — ought to

12

be considered separately. But for purposes of the

indictment and the plea of guilty and all of the

14

pretrial motions in this case it's all one case.

15

QUESTION;

But for the purpose of

16

jurisdiction, I don't see how the judge that’s trying

MR. McCONNELL;

Your Honor, all -- there will

QUESTION;

Will the same judge try the case?

MR. McCONNELL;

In this case, the same judge

23

was going to try the case.

It could be reassigned to

another judge, but I think it’s much more common to

25

reassign it to the same judge.
