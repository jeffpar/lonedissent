ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED H. BARTLIT, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARTLITi

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case is the first opportunity for this

11

Court to consider the antitrust illegality of non-price

12

vertical restraints since the 1977 Sylvania decision.

13

Sylvania recognized that non-price vertical

14

restraints are not per se illegal even though they may

15

have some effect on price.

16

of reason would apply to such restraints, and noted that

17

there will be no departure from the rule of reason

18

unless there is a demonstrable economic effect, not

19

formalistic line drawing.

20

Sylvania said that the rule

Despite Sylvania, the Seventh Circuit found

21

non-price vertical restraints to be per se unlawful.

22

They did that, Petitioner urges, by using two rules of

23

law that seriously cut away from and limit the

24

usefulness of Sylvania to businessmen.

25

What the Seventh Circuit did was this;

the

Seventh Circuit said that the non-price restraints in

2

this case were part of a price-fixing conspiracy.

3

used a rule in determining whether a conspiracy existed

which makes it very easy to find a resale price fixing

conspiracy.

is an interest in a manufacturer on the part of price,

7

concern about price, which you will almost always have,

8

coupled with complaints from distributers followed by a

distributor termination.

But the Court used a s tandard for finding a

the question of the underlying conspiracy.

2

Then the Seventh Circuit, having made it easy

3

for a plaintiff to get to the jury on the question cf

4

whether there was the underlying conspiracy made it even

5

easier for the jury to find that the programs in

6

question were part-of the conspiracy, because the court

7

didn't require that there be any evidence at all linking

8

the programs in question to the conspiracy.

9

The result is that it is now very easy for a

10

plaintiff to get tc the jury any time a manufacturer

11

uses procompetitive, non-price programs like these.

believe that.
MR. RARTLIT:

Yes, Justice Rehnquist, there

I can't.

The evidence -- the

evidence showed that, by way of background, that the

6

plaintiff in this case made 75 percent of his sales to

7

only six customers; that he testified that he didn't

have salesmen; that, as the appendix shows, he

9

advertised that he -- his margins were so lew because he

20

Plaintiff's expert testified at trial — and this is a

21

quote — that the market was "highly competitive at all

QUESTION;

But are you suggesting a different

12

standard of proof for the element of a conspiracy in a

13

case like this than we ordinarily have for facts to be

14

found by a jury?

15

KB. BARTLIT;

No, Justice Rehnquist.

I'm

16

suggesting that a standard cf proof for a conspiracy be

17

adopted, for vertical conspiracies, which is consistent

18

with this Court's statement of the rule of law in ether

19

cases like Kachal, other decisions of this Court.

20

In other words, this Court has never found a

21

price fixing conspiracy, resale vertical price fixing

22

conspiracy based on the termination of a single

23

distributor.

24
25

It has never done that.

QUESTION;

Well, but this Court is not

ordinarily a finder of fact.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

is, if the issue is one of conspiracy, why shouldn’t it

from what little I know about the market, negate the

possibility of a conspiracy.

HR. BARTLIT;

No, Justice Rehnquist.

But if a

20

court adopts as a rule of law that it's sufficient to

21

get to a jury if all you have are the kinds of

22

activities that one would expect to find in any

23

competitive market, the ease with which a conspiracy can

24

be found threatens the use of programs that are in

25

existence at the same time.

will have the same function, the same purpose, and the

same basic economic effects, and accordingly, will leave

the same evidentiary footprints, if I might put it that

way, so that it becomes empirically impossible unless we

11

Now, if I may stress what I regard as the most

12

critical of these points I have made here, namely that

13

non-price and price agreements have essentially

14

identical functional consequences, I would like to say

15

there's nothing particularly new or startling about that

18

proposition.

18

in Justice White's concurring opinion.

23

for him to succeed in interbrand competition.

24
25

By hypothesis, a supplier has decided that a

Now, what is it that these non-price
restrictions are to achieve?

They are to achieve, as

18

1

Sylvania explicitly recognized, an attenuation of

2

intrabrand price competition, an attenuation that is

3

sufficient to allow distributors who are complying and

4

incurring the costs cf complying with non-price

5

restrictions to cover those costs with the resulting

6

intrabrand prices.• If someone else not complying with

7

those rules is beating intrabrand prices down below a

8

level which is sufficient to cover the compliance with
the programs desired by the supplier, the non-price

10

program must fail in its purpose.

11

Sylvania is to have any operational meaning as opposed

12

to existing as a mere theoretical possibility in the

13

literature, it must enable a supplier under these

14

circum stances working together with his distributors to

15

build an operational non-price program.

16

And therefore, if

We were told in Broadcast Fusic that the

definitions but by a sensible, functional approach tc

20

the question of whether the behavior had desirable

21

efficiency effects.

22

The lesson in Broadcast *usic in this context,

23

I urge upon the Court, is to recognize the need for

functioning a fence of the kind I have described sc that

And if we were to follow what

you're arguing today, what precisely would be the

evidentiary proof that it would take to get to a jury?

14

MR. BAXTER:

Well, it would depend, Justice

15

O'Connor, on the characteristics of the case.

16

large number of cases — I take for an example the

17

Cernuto decision in the Third Circuit below — there is

18

no evidence that there was an articulated non-price set

of restrictions put into effect, no evidence that there

1

had adopted an articulated program involving non-price

2

constraints addressed to an identifiable problem of the

3

sort that Sylvania recognized, a distributional problem

4

that is appropriately addressed by non-price restraints,

5

then under those circumstances a plaintiff would have to

6

show that in addition to agreeing on the non-price

7

restrictions, there was an explicit agreement with

8

respect to price.

9

faced by a plaintiff in this subcategory of cases.

10

11

It would change the burden of proof

QUESTION*

Could evidence of uniform retail

prices constitute evidence of an explicit agreement then?

12

NR. BAXTER*

I think it could under extreme

13

circumstances, but uniform pricing is at best

14

circumstantial evidence, and often it is not very

15

probative.

16

QUESTION*

Well, how is a district judge to

17

know whether there are extreme circumstances where he

18

should let a case with uniform prices go to the jury?

That isn’t what

7

happened at all.

Indeed, in this case, in the reply

8

9

that they do not argue the jury instructions.

If they

10

do not argue the jury instructions, I respectfully

11

suggest to this Court that the jury had every right to

12

do what they did.

The jury had ample evidence.

Mr. Bartlit’s statement to this Court is net a

13

statement of the inferences that the jury had a fair

15

opportunity to resolve in favor of Spray-Rite.

16

the same statement Mr. Bartlit made in opening statement

-- I think there's some confusion

in the briefs as to exactly when the last dealer

7

MR. FOOTE;

Well, I think Mr. Stein testified

8

in the summer of 1968 that he reviewed in the district

9

office in St. Louis a number of complaints because it

20

was the attitude at that time of the management in St.

21

Louis that they continuously get complaints.

22

Now, there's a footnote in the brief that says

23

that that evidence is not before the Court because

MR. FOOTE;

I don't think so.

I think it's a

the jury -- in fact, it usually does instruct the jury

13

on questions of fact.

KR. FOOTE;

Oh, but in setting the standard

15

the court has to tell the jury to what extent in each

16

case, as was done in this case, the jury has tc be

17

instructed, as they were, that unilateral actions are

18

not unlawful.

Yeah, but I'm just going to quote a

20

sentence from Judge Bower's opinion, referring to the
