Court again decried the carnage caused by drunken

12

drivers on our highways.

Recently in South Dakota versus Neville this

Spurred on by increasing public awareness, and

14

encouraged by the federal government, the states are

15

stepping up law enforcement efforts to combat this

16

national problem, and one of the most effective tools in

17

law enforcement's arsenal is the breath alcohol test.

18

Such tests are used in every state, the District of

19

Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
In California, which I am sure is typical,

20
21

breath alcohol tests are used in two-thirds of all drunk

22

driving arrests.
Evidential breath test instruments provide a

23
24

rapid,

economical,

and accurate means of immediately

25

determining the suspect’s blood alcohol content.

Because they are self-contained, automatic units, they

can be easily and accurately operated by a field officer

with minimal training.

operation allows the officer to complete the test

quickly and return to the highway to do his job.

The ease and rapidity of

6

Immediate results also permit additional

7

sample collection where an unexpectedly low result

8

suggests intoxication by combination of alcohol and

9

drugs.

Breath testing is also the least intrusive cf

10

the options from the suspect's point of view.

It does

11

not involve bodily intrusion or invasion cf privacy, and

12

assures the shortest period of detention.
Breath testing is broadly accepted as valid.

13
14

Self-contained devices avoid the possibility of human

15

error or manipulation and allow subsequent checks upon

16

the accuracy of the test system.
Now, this case is here on certiorari.

18

California Court of Appeals held unconstitutional as a

19

violation of federal due process use of an evidential

20

breath test instrument unless that device preserves the

21

breath sample actually tested for possible retesting by

22

the defendant or alternatively a procedure is followed

23

which collects an equivalent sample for the defendant's

24

use .

MR. KIRK;

state is free to choose its own machines.

1

impression.

I thought from the material at the

2

beginning of your opponent’s brief that there was

3

another breath testing device that did conserve the

4

sample, and that was permissible to use in California.

5

Am I wrong on that?

6

MR. KIRK:

Your Honor, that is talking about

7

the indium tube device or actually the gas

8

chromatograph, which analyzes an indium tube as part of

9

the process.

10

That is true, that exists, and that is

approved in California.
QUESTION:

I see.

2

QUESTION:

But it isn’t widely used —

3

MR. KIRK:

No, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

-- in California?

5

MR. KIRK:

It is not widely used in

In fact —

6

California, and there is only one single county which

7

has ever made any kind of continuous use, and that is

8

the county of San Eernadino, which since 1973 has used

9

it because of the difficulty of collecting breath

20

samples in a widespread county.
Now, on what basis did the California court

2

22

make such a wholesale condemnation in Trombetta,

23

purportedly under the due process clause of the federal

24

constitution as interpreted by the California Supreme

25

Court?

In People versus Hitch, that court looked to the

7

opinion in Brady versus Maryland and divined a

constitutional principle requiring preservation of any

evidence which might possibly be favorable to the

Now, I say divined because that is exactly

14

the primary focus of respondents and their amici.

The state need not

18

is predicated upon a claimed need to provide the

19

defendant with any evidence which has a reasonble

20

possibility of yielding results favorable to the defense

21

or casting doubt upon the state's case.

22

that "might possibly" standard which this Court recently

23

rejected in United States versus Valenzuela Verncw.

24
25

The Hitch-Trombetta preservation requirement

It was just

The Hitch-Trombetta standard is in fact no
standard at all.

As this Court observed in Killian

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

versus United States, almost everything is evidence cf

2

something, and in Valenzuela Vernow, possibilities of

3

favorable evidence are limited only by the imaginations

4

of counsel and judges.
This is especially true, I believe, with any

5
6

analytical measuring or recording method.

7

the only prerequisite to the admission of scientific

8

tests are proof of the expert's qualifications, accuracy

9

of the equipment, and reliability of the method

Ordinarily,

10

followed.

11

accepted methods be infallible to be admissible,

12

possibilities of error going to weight rather than to

13

admissibility.

14

It is not required that the results of

The Trombetta and Hitch cases depart from this

15

rule applicable to physical testing and require as a

16

matter of federal due process that there must be a

17

secondary verification of the primary test before the

18

primary test is admissible.

19

Now, the irony in this case is that there are

20

few areas in which the defendant is so well protected.

21

The Intoxolizer, as are all evidential breath test

22

instruments in California, has been tested and approved

Now, Brady cannot be the source of the

evidential breath test machine.

21

with which we would not agree by any means, suggesting

that you could capture it with an indium tube or with

That some may consider one procedure

QUESTION;

This sounds to me like a very

amorphous concept you are talking about, a fair

10

opportunity to challenge the state's case.

11

supposing the state has four or five eye witnesses, and

12

the defendant doesn’t have any access to them at all.

13

Now, is cross examination of the eye witnesses what you

14

would call a fair opportunity to challenge?

15
16
17

MR. KIRK;

I mean,

That has been the traditional rule

in this country, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

I just don’t see how a vague phrase

18

like ”a fair opportunity to challenge" moves the ball

19

much in this rather particular situation, where we are

20

talking about, I take it, whether Brady against Maryland

21

should be extended.

22

MR. KIRK;

23

here is what process is due, what is fair.

MR. KIRK;

I mean, we are focusing in the general

Certainly.

I am not sure I

understand the question.

5

QUESTION;

Well, it is your case to argue.

6

MR. KIRK;

When physical evidence is lost cr

7

destroyed, it is true that the defendant can no longer

8

see it fcr himself, hut neither can the jury, and the

9

absence of the physical proof both diminishes the weight

10

of the state's case and exposes it to doubts arising

11

from the loss.

12

still explore the competence of the expert,

13

acceptability cf the methodology, and adequacy of the

14

equipment to challenge the test validity, and secure in

15

the knowledge that the state cannot remove all

16

possibility of doubt by presenting the physical evidence

17

itself, the defendant has even greater latitude in

18

creating reasonable doubt than perhaps existed before.

With scientific tests, the defendant can

Now, there are additional protections with

19
20

evidential breath test instruments like the

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20

MR. DE MEC;

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21

please the Court, petitioner argues for a rule on the

22

due process duty to preserve which in the final analysis

23

would permit law enforcement to choose unilaterally

methods cf testing which in effect would use up or

25

consume or discard or destroy the evidence which is

23

vital on the issue of the guilt or the innocence of an
accused in the driving under the influence case.
QUESTION;

Would you find it constitutionally

objectionable if the officers were trained to take a
blood test and — take a blood test right on the scene?
KB. DE EEC;

I would not. Your Honor.

The law

in California at least at this time in the case of the
collection of blood does provide for the retention for a
year, and provides that the defendant may have a sample
for retesting so that would certainly give him the right
to have a retest.
QUESTION:

Do they now take blood tests right

at the time of the arrest, cut on the road?
MR. DE MEO:

No, they do not. Your Honor.

It

requires someone who is properly trained to do that in
the medical discipline.

In the event that the

government does utilize a device which does destroy the
evidence, and if that evidence, the result of it is
inculpatory, then California argues that it should be
entitled to introduce that evidence on the issue of
guilt of the defendant —

case to be sure that they preserve a sample of that

20

trial is not placed in the position where he must only

21

be permitted to cress examine the machine that was used

22

or a piece of paper where the results of the test are

23

reported to cross examine as to whether or not it is

24

connected up or not with this defendant, or perhaps

25

there was an error, or whether or not in effect the

Calibrating the machine.
I think that for a fair trial for a defendant

3
4

accused of this type of a crime, he must be armed with

5

the same type of artillery as the prosecution has.

6

Namely, he must be entitled to retest that evidence.

7

Why should he have to rely on what the government

8

says?

Well, there is one way he could do

that although we are all presumed to know the law, it is

that government is in a superior position with its

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS - RESUMED

MR. DE MEOs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, commenting briefly on the Brady case,

9

it is our position that Brady necessarily applies to the

10

situation at hand, because if Erady only requires a

11

disclosure of that which is preserved in a fixed form by

12

law enforcement, then it seems that it would be easy to

13

avoid

14

testing material evidence which use up or discard or

destroy the evidence in the process of the test.

MR. DE MEOi

Even if all the machines agreed

14

exactly, and in that regard. Your Honor, I might say

15

that if the defendant is accorded this right, which is

16

simple for law enforcement to do to preserve, that if it

17

does agree through the defense criminalist analysis, I

18

think it would have some beneficial effect on the

19

problem of persons who drive under the influence and

20

cause accidents, namely, that if they see that they have

21

no way of contesting the case, that there would be less

congestion of the courts, mere pleas of guilty, and

these cases would be out of the way.

Do you think that even if this

fact that it might he wrong only that seldom should

nevertheless result in giving the defense the

5

opportunity to ferret out that one in a million?

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Because I don't see any claims by

you or any evidence or any statistical presentation that

9

would indicate how often these results might be

10

erroneous.
MR. DE KEOi

11

To answer your question, Yotr

12

Honor,

we feel that if any one person were convicted

13

when if he had an opportunity to retest the evidence it

14

would have been exculpatory, that the United States does

15

not win in that kind of a situation, it loses. It is the

16

same as the Iglio case, the same as the Moody case,

17

where if there is false evidence that caused a

18

conviction, it would fall within that ambit.
QUESTION:

19

Is the machine that produces this

20

evidence, makes this reading, will it be in the same

21

condition when the trial occurs as it was when the test

22

was taken?

on what California has done in response to this case.

25

Section 13.353.5 of the Vehicle Code was adopted in

ug
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

response to Trcmbetta, and the language of the

2

legislature, "in order to provide a constitutional

3

procedure for administering the hreath test in light of

4

the decision of the Court of Appeal in People v.

5

Trcmbetta, it is necessary that this Act take effect

6

immediately."
And what this Act does, when a person chooses

7

8

the breath test over the blood or the urine test, law

9

enforcement must tell him new, which was one of cur

10

points below, tell him now that there will be no breath

11

preserved by this particular instrument that is being

12

utilized, but that government will provide him free of

13

cost a sample of his blood or his urine which he may

14

subsequently have available to him to be tested by a

15

referee or a criminalist or a toxicologist of his own

16

chocsing.

17

So that raises the question as to whether or

18

not there is anything left for the Court to determine.
