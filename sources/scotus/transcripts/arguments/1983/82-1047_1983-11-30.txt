Mr. Wilkins, I think

1977 the United States commenced

a civil in rem forfeiture action in the United States

seeking forfeiture to the United States of an assortment

12

of firearms seized on January 20, 1977 Ly special agents

13

by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

14

forfeiture complaint alleged that Patrick Mulcahey had

15

used and intended to use the firearms in violation of

16

the laws of the United States while engaged as a dealer

17

in firearms without a license.

provisions of 18 U.S.C. Section 924(d).

sought to raise his prior acquittal on a related

Mr. Mulcahey

The District Court on motion of the government

2

not preclude a subsequent civil action.

3

thereafter submitted by stipulation the transcript of

4

the criminal trial to the court, and the court thereupon

5

found that the government had shown by preponderance of

6

the evidence that the firearms were indeed subject tc

On appeal a divided panel of the Fourth

Chief Judge Winter of that ccurt dissented

reasoning that while a criminal penalty following a

criminal acquittal was barred by the Coffey case that

case did not preclude the imposition of subsequent civil

penalties.

adhered to the panel decision by a 5-4 vote.

The majority again relied on Coffey and

rejected the government's argument that it was not

noted

nevertheless be precluded because "there is nothing

2

remedial about forfeiture under Section 924(d).”

3

Judge Winter joined by three others again

4

dissented relying principally upon his dissent at the

5

panel stage although he also added that while the

6

criminal provisions of the Firearms Act reach only

7

completed violations, the forfeiture provision at issue

8

here reaches firearms that are merely intended to be

9

used in violation of the law.

10

Congress’ intent to provide a broad remedial sanction.
The question in this case, therefore, is

whether an acquittal on criminal gun control charges

precludes a subsequent civil in rem forfeiture action

1

because Congress has clearly indicated its intent to

2

proviie a civil sanction.

3

The Court of Appeals concluded that this

4

Court's decision in Coffey mandated preclusion here

5

because the civil action arose out of the same facts

6

that were involved-in a prior criminal prosecution.

7

While there is indeed some lanuage in Coffey which would

8

lend support to this broad rule of preclusion the

9

subsequent decisions of this Court have given Coffey a

10
11

significantly narrower reading.
In Helvering v. Mitchell the government

12

brought a civil penalty action to recover a $364,000

13

fine for the fraudulent avoidance of income tax

14

following the taxpayer's acquittal on criminal charges

15

of willfully evading the income tax.

16

course , faced with this large fine raised his prior

17

criminal acquittal to bar the civil penalty action.

18

The taxpayer, cf

The Court of Appeals relying on Coffey

19

reversed, but this Court in an opinion by Justice

20

Brandeis reversed.

21

the argument that res judicata barred the subsequent

22

penalty action.

23

The Helvering court first dispatched

The Court noted reversing the position taken

24

in the Coffey court that the difference in the burden of

25

proof in criminal and civil cases precludes application

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of the doctrine of res judicata.

This Court quite

2

recently in the One Lot Emerald Cut Stones case used the

3

exact same rationale to dispense with the argument that

4

a criminal acquittal collaterally estopped a subsequent

5

civil forfeiture action.
The Helvering court also dismissed the

6
7

contention that double jeopardy barred the subsequent

8

action noting that Congress has the authority to impose

9

both civil and criminal penalties for the same conduct.

10

Finally, it dispensed with the Coffey objection noting

11

simply that the rule in the Coffey case does not apply

12

when there has been a criminal acquittal followed by a

13

subsequent civil action requiring a different degree of

14

proof.
Therefore, the crucial question here is net

15

QUESTION:

18

In the Coffey case, Mr. Wilkins,

was the proceeding civil or criminal?
MR. WILKINS:

19

The forfeiture action?

It was

20

an in rent civil forfeiture action, and the Court said

21

that this was nominally a civil in rem forfeiture

22

action .

23

The crucial question here, therefore, is not

24

whether Coffey mandates preclusion but rather whether

25

Section 924(d) is properly classified as a civil

2

this is a question of statutory construction that

3

proceeds on two levels.

4

This Court’s decisions clearly indicate that

First, the Court seeks to determine whether

5

Congress either expressly or impliedly has indicated its

6

intent to apply one label or the other; and second, when

7

Congress has indicated its intent to apply a civil label

8

the court examines the particular sanction involved to

9

see whether that sanction is so punitive in purpose or

10

effect as to negate that intention.

11

that this sanction here is civil.

12

That analysis shows

Perhaps the clearest indication that this

13

sanction is indeed civil is the fact that Congress

14

provided civil procedures for its enforcement.

That would net really move the ball much would

MR. WILKINSs

4

Well, Justice Rrandeis in

5

Helvering said that Congress may not provide civil

6

procedures for the • enf orcein ent of punitive sanctions.

7

In a case that you posit where it was rather clearly

quite a confiscatory sort of forfeiture and for rather

9

obviously punitive motives perhaps the court would say,

10

no you

could not provide that sort of --

11

QUESTIO!?:

The fact that civil procedures had

12

been provided would not advance the argument that it was

13

a civil rather than a criminal penalty.
MR. WILKINSs

14

Well, it does to the extent the

15

Sometimes, Mr. Wilkins, we see the

term "quasi-criminal" apply to these forfeiture

proceedings.

Does that have any relevance?

constitutional rights.

QUESTION;

HR. WILKINS:

Right.

In fact in other

14

decisions this Court has refused to apply the

quasi-criminal sort of analysis to apply Sixth Amendment

confrontation rights, the Fifth Amendment double

these sorts of constitutional rights have been denied.

QUESTION;

All of

If the statute in a given

21

forfeiture statute were characterized as criminal as

22

being punitive in nature and not remedial would double

23

jeopardy apply to all elements even though some of the

24

elements of the civil offense — the forfeiture offense

25

were different from the criminal?

MR. WILKINS

If the Court were to conclude

2

that it was sc punitive in nature and effect as to te

3

properly called a criminal sanction I would assume that

4

it would apply to the entire action, but you noted one

5

very important point here.

6

elements between the forfeiture actions here and the

7

criminal action, and we believe that that is another

8

strong indication that Congress intended this as a civil

9

sanction because it reaches weapons that are merely

There is a difference in the

10

intended to be used in violation of the law whereas the

11

criminal sanction only applies to completed actions.

12

Finally,

although the court below said there

13

was nothing remedial about forfeiture we believe that

14

this simply ignores that broad prophylactic goals of the

15

gun control legislation that this Court has repeatedly

16

noted.

17

states to control firearms traffic within their borders,

18

and elimination of unregulated firearms that have teen

19

20

furthers that remedial purpose.

21

This legislation was enacted to enable the

22

the position that forfeiture under this prevision is

Rehnquist, that is, to determine whether or not this

sanction is so punitive in purpose or effect as to

negate that clear intention that Congress indicated to

provide a civil sanction here.

5

This question is rather difficult because the

6

standards to be applied in making it are somewhat vague

7

an ambiguous.

8

subjective impact upon an individual cannot by itself

9

suffice to make a statute punitive and criminal.

10

The taxpayer in Helvering faced with a

The fact that a statute has a severe

21

MR. LOUTHIAN*

Why is it not

I think that can be answered on

two grounds.

One is in United States v. United States

24

That issue was addressed, and if you recall in that case

25

some gambling proceeds were taken and the Court said

that ycu cannot take things simply because they are

substantially more today.

17
