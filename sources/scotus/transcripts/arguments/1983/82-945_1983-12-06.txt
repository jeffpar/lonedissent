ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
ME. FLAHERTY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12

Service to investigate the immigration status of its

13

employees?

issue presented in this case.

That is the first and the most important

Can an employer be required to pay illegal

15
16

aliens a sum of money equal to six months'

pay under the

17

National Labor Relations ?ct covering a period of time

18

when the illegal aliens are not present in this country,

19

when they are in Mexico, and they are not lawfully

20

available for work?

21

in this case.

That is the second issue presented

22

And can the National Labor Relations Board

23

require an employer to write reinstatement offers in

24

Spanish and to leave them open for a period of four

years?

That is the third issue presented in this case.

9

MR. FLAHERTY;

I cannot put myself in Mr.

Surak's head, but I can certainly tell you there was a

10

dispute between the union and the company,

11

was in Bill Johnson's Restaurant, and the --

12

22

MR. FLAHERTY:

That is not relevant, however,

with respect to the right to exercise the constitutional

24

right tc report a violation of the law.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Flaherty, are you sure that the

1

right to turn in aliens to the — illegal aliens tc the

2

INS can be equated with filing a lawsuit in state court,

3

the way you had in Bill Johnson's, for constitutional

4

purpos cs?
MR. FLAHERTYi

5

Very definitely, Justice

6

Eehnguist.

Under the Nor Pennington doctrine, this

7

Court has held repeatedly in many cases that efforts to

8

enforce the law, whether they be through the filing cf

9

lawsuits, through petitioning, or through lobbying to

10

seek stricter enforcement of the law by law enforcement

11

agencies, or other petitions tc the government, are

12

within the First Amendment right to petition the

13

government, and in the Foro Precision Metal case, which

14

is cited in our reply brief, that precise issue was

15

addressed by the Ninth Circuit.
It was a petition to the police by IBM for

16
17

them to enforce the law that led to the indictment of 14

18

people, and the Ninth Circuit held squarely that that

19

was within the First Amendment right to petition the

20

govern ment.

QUESTIONS

But, Mr. Flaherty, isn't there a

difference in the facts here?

Some of them were.

over and said, look at all of them.
MR. FLAHERTY;

16

He had asked the employees

17

after the election, before this letter was written,

18

whether they were present legally, and a number of them

19

said,

20

no, they weren't, so he did know at that time.

not be redressed, and perhaps that is not the case

MR. FLAHERTYt

5

The holding in Bill Johnson's

6

focused on the First Amendment right tc petition the

7

government, and it said, for that reason, as well as -QUESTIONS

8

Well, I think the opinion also

9

focused on the fact that the employer would have been

10

left with no forum in which to pursue a remedy for an

11

actual injury to the employer.

this case?
MR. FLAHERTY;

13

Does that distinguish

I don't think so, Your Honor.

14

I think the First Amendment right to petition the

15

government stands on its own, and that this Court

16

recognized that in Bill Johnson's.

reporting of a violation of the law is just as essential

QUESTION:

And before the election, everything

was hunky-dory.
MR. FLAHERTY:

Well, before the election -- it

10

was af ter the election that he asked the employees

11

whether they were legally present here, and they

12

admitted that they were illegally present here.

13

knew that, then he wrote the letter.

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Well, the board and the lower

15

courts drew the inference from the factual situation,

16

though, that he was animated by antiunion animus in

doing this.

HR. FLAHERTY:

QUESTION:

MR. FLAHERTY:

No, we are not reviewing that.

In the Quarles case, this Court observed that a person’s

and immunities which arises out of the essential

character of our form of government, which must be

QUESTION:

7

What have lower courts done in the

labor law area about instances where an employer has

it the issue whether the board could enjoin the holding

-- the prosecution of the suit, or net?
MR. FLAHERTY:

That is correct, and it was

24

alleged that the suit was brought in retaliation for the

25

employees exercising their concerted -- their right to

and in

2

retaliation for their having filed a complaint, and that

is precisely what is presented here.

4

Sure-Tan’s actions were undertaken in retaliation for

5

these employees having voted in a union.

precisely the same situation.

It is alleged that

It is

And the First Amendment right to petition the

7

8

government that was present in Dill Johnson’s is just as

9

present here as well, and drawin from the Nor Pennington

10

line of cases, this Court has held that the right tc

11

seek enforcement of the law is privileged under the

12

First Amendment regardless of why the actions were taken

13

to enforce the law, as long as those actions were not a

14

sham.
And in Bill Johnson’s, this Court held that a

15
16

sham would mean that there would have to be no

17

reasonable basis for the actions taken.

Well, let's say there was not an

Now, this Court recognized in Plyler versus

no occasion to impose a remedy, but in the situation

where the board does find a violation of the Act, as

here,

two statutes leads to that result,

appropriate for the board to consider the normal

remedies, which are under 10(c) of the Act reinstatement

QUESTION;

Hasn't the Court -- hasn't this

Court over the years said that we pay great deference to

5

the Labor Board provisions for remedy and things of that

kind because they are dealing with it all the time, and

7

they develop what we call expertise?

does the Court of Appeals have in these areas?

(General laughter.)

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not that bad.

The board is the expert agency,

17

and as a rule the matter ought to be remanded to the

And the Courts of Appeals, all

again,

deferring tc the board’s expertise, the normal

2

rule is that unless there is some effort to make the

3

employee whole, the purposes of the Act will not be

4

effecuated,

which Section 10(c) requires.

QUESTION;

5

There is legislation pending in

6

Congress to make it illegal, tc make it an unlawful act,

7

a crime to hire an undocumented alien.

legislation passed.

11

Would the board or anybody else be

Suppose that

not.

QUESTION;

Not if they pass that legislation.

MR. KNEEDLEE;

No, if the employment -- in no

circum stances.

16

reinstatement of the employee to an illegal relationship

17

and to pay him inconsistent with such a statute would

18

clearly be improper, but as I said, the employment

19

relationship is not illegal under the immigration laws.

The employment relationship would then

QUESTION;

Let me go back to this dichotomy

that seems to be interesting everyone about the employer

reporting these illegal aliens.

historically has penalized employers or unions for dcing

25

good things if they were in violation of the Act.

QUESTION;

That's correct.

In other words, suppose the

Christmas dinner for every employee and maybe a case of

But he might get in trouble with

the Labor Board for doing that, might he not?
MR. KNEEDLER;

12

That’s right.

That's correct.

13

The Labor Act does attach consequences to things that

14

would otherwise be entirely lawful.
QUESTION:

15

So when he reports the criminal

16

conduct of these employees being here illegally, he is

17

doing his patriotic and civic duty, but he might get

18

penalized for that properly, tco.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Is that not so?

That's correct, and we suggest

that —
QUESTION;

But you aren't asking for all --

that is more than you ask for.

Yes, we are not saying

everything that he -- every report he makes, but in the
