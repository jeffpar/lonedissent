CEAL ARGUMENT CF ICUIS J. CAFUSC, SOIICITCR GENEFAI,

STATE CF MICHIGAN; ON EEFALF CF THE FETITICNFE

5

MR. CARUSOs

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

6

please the Court, this case involves a collateral attack

7

on state courts' proceedings by way of habeas corpus

8

review in Federal District Court.

9

It concerns a claimed erroneous jury

10

instruction that was given cn presumed intent, in

11

connection with a murder trial of Respondent Engle,

12

which culminated in a guilty verdict of first degree

13

murder in July of 1973.

14

The Federal District Court concluded that the

15

claimed infirm instruction is net constitutionally

16

infirm .

17

and re versed .

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed

Collateral attack here is precluded by tbe

18
19

failure of Respondent Engle to make timely objection to

20

the claimed infirm instruction.
Michigan has a contemporaneous objection

21
22

requirement.

It is embodied in statute and in court

23

rule.

24

"and the Court will review error, without objection," tc

25

prevent what it calls a miscarriage of justice.

The rule contains, hewever, an escape provision*

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Respondent, here, mistakenly asserts that

2

there's a broad per se exception to that contemporaneous

3

rule, objection rule, in that it does net apply to the

4

instructions given on elements of crime.

5

None cf the cases cited by Respondent support

6

that proposition.

7

actually apply the rule and make an assessment as tc the

8

likelihood of the potential for miscarriage cf justice.

9

What the Court does in those cases is

And «here the merits have been analyzed by the

10

Court in these cases when the objection has not been

11

made has been because it has been suspected that there

12

is the potential for miscarriage cf justice.

13

because the rule is not applied.

14
15
16

QUESTION*

It is not

Mr. Caruso, didn't the Sixth

Circuit disagree with you on that point and say —
MR. CARUSCs

Yes.

The Sixth Circuit said that

17

the State of Michigan does not apply its contemporaneous

18

objection rule.

19

But it does apply it.

And People v. Wright and People v. Perez, two

20

cases cf current vintage, although timely objections

21

were not made in these two cases on presumped intent

22

instructions, the Court took the opportunity in those

23

cases tc direct the trial court tc step making these

24

sort of presumed instructions.

25

Eut, nevertheless, in those cases, the Court

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

reaffi rired the existence cf the contemporaneous

2

ob ject ion rule, and reccgni2ed its liability.

3

In the one case, in leople v. Wright, it feund

4

harmle ss error; and, in the other case it found the

5

errcr was harmless; hut, nevertheless, as the Cc urt

6

indica ted, quoting the rule, it is still the law in

7

Hic big an.
Here, there is no objection made at th e trial

8
9

stage

tc the claimed infirm instruction.

The di rect

10

appeal that was taken tc the Michigan Court cf A ppeaIs

11

as cf

12

instru cticn.

13

1975 v hen that direct appeal ended.

14

Wright challenged only the intoxication
The judgment cf conviction became final in

There was no timely application made f or leave

15

tc app eal tc the Supreme Court.

16

object ion to the intent, presumed intent instrue t ion,

17

came o ut on three applications for delayed appea 1, two

18

to the State Supreme Ccurt, and one application for

19

delaye d appeal to the Court of Appeals.

20

The first time the

I

New, when these applications were file d, the

21

prosec uting attorney raised the absence of compl iance by

22

the re spondent was a contemporaneous objection r ule , as

23

well a s making a response tc the merits of the c laim s.

24
25

New, the Ccurt — all three of these
applic ations fer delayed appeal, were denied by the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

courts.

They were denied on the basis of lack of merits

2

on grounds presented, and the Court is not persuaded

3

that the question presented should be reviewed.
New, although the Michigan Constitution does

4
5

require that the Appellate Court, in denying leave to

6

appeal in a matter, should give the grounds for the

7

denial, a denial, the Court says, is net a decision on

8

the merits.
And, thus, in order for Respondent Engle to

9
10

have had his federal claim decided, it would have teen

11

necessary, in each one of those discretionary appeals,

12

to have had the review on the merits by a grant of leave.
Sc we're taking the position here, insofar as

13
14

Michigan law is concerned, and we seek the application

15

of the Sykes Rule when there is a denial order -- and

16

Michigan has — has in Michigan -- they have a

17

contemporaneous objection rule; the defendant has net

18

complied with it, and the prosecutor has argued the rule

19

in response to the application for leave to appeal, and

20

there is no decision on the merits because the Court has

21

repeatedly said this to the bar in Michigan;

22

habeas court must assume that the state followed its

23

contemporaneous objection rule.
This would be consistent with the general rule

24
25

then, a

that,

in habeas cases, the state court decision is

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

presumed correct, absent a contrary shewing,

2

overwhelming contrary showing by the prisoner.

3
4

QUESTION:

Solicitor general, may I ask a

question, because maybe I missed something you said.

5

But the Court of Appeals said that, in People

6

against Wright, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the

7

contemporaneous objection rule does not apply to

8

Sandstrom instructions, as I read it.

9

I haven’t read the Wright case myself.

10

MR. CARUSO:

In the Wright case, the Court

11

applied the contemporaneous objection rule and made a

12

decision that it should review this sort of an error,

13

claimed error, simply because there's the likeliheed of

14

miscarriage of justice.

15

Eut the thing of it is, the Court also has

16

supervisory authority ever all litigation in state

17

courts in Michigan.

18

reason

19

opportunity, in these two consolidated cases, to

20

announce the prophylactic rule cf Sandstrom, and

21

directed the lower courts to stop using those kinds of

22

instru ctions.

23

And they made it very clear: the

that they took these cases was to seize upon the

QUESTION:

But did they say that they would

24

review Sandstrom error, even if there was no

25

contemporaneous objection?

7

2

MR. CARUSO;
conclusively; no.
QUESTION*

3
4

But that's, apparently, what the

Sixth Circuit thought they said?
MR. CARUSO*

5
6

I don't recall their saying that

The Sixth Circuit apparently

thought that; yes.
This position, I would say, promotes comedy.

7
8

And, as in the showing by the respondent/appellant --

9

and there certainly has been no showing of cause and

10

actual prejudice, actual prejudice at the level shewn in

11

U.S. v. Frady, for example.
Here, the claimed instructional error dees net

12

13

contravene the decision of Sandstrom.
QUESTION*

14

Mr. Caruso, normally we don't

15

reexamine the holding of the Court of Appeals on what

16

the state law is.
Eo you plan to discuss the ether arguments in

17
18

this case?

19

MR. CARUSC*

Yes.

20

But, insofar as the state law is concerned, I

21

say that it has -- the State of Michigan dees have the

22

contemporaneous objection requirement, and it is an

23

independent state ground.
find this is what was held in

24
25

Wainwright v. Sykes; it's what was held in several ether
cases.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

QUESTION;

Well, if the State Supreme Court

2

makes what we consider an erroneous instruction cf its

3

own law or statute that doesn’t involve the

4

Constitution, we certainly don’t review it.
If the Court of Appeals makes what, in cur

5
6

view,

is an error in construing a State Supreme Court

7

opinion, that’s open to review here, is it net?
NE. CARUSC;

8

9
10

I would say so, yes, Chief

Justic e.
And I think that if that is the conclusion

11

that they came to — and it is — that the State of

12

Michigan dees net apply contemporaneous objection rule,

13

that that is erroneous, and that's contrary.

14

But the Federal District Court agreed that the

15

error that is claimed for by respondent/applellant did

16

not violate the Sanstrcm rule, and they didn’t even

17

bother to make a harmless error analysis.

18

Engle was convicted cf first degree murder in

19

July of 1973, convicted cf first degree murder of his

20

foreman at the Chrysler Auto Plant in Detroit.

21

Relieving him to have been responsible for

22

having teen laid off December 4, 1972, December 7,

1S72,

23

at SsOO p.m., Engle entered the auto plant, told his

24

nephew he was going to kill a guy.

25

Foreman Lantzy's office, encountered a clerk, and asked

Engle entered the

2

Lan tzy ..

3

He said he was temporarily out, and offered tc

4

go find him.

Engle said that, never mind, that he would

5

go find him.

At 9;45 p.m., two employees saw Engle

6

talking to Lantzy and then saw him sheet Lantzy, wbc

7

ran.

8

over him, and then walked away and returned tc the

9

office of lantzy and told the clerk that he had shot and

10

He was shot twice more, and he fell.

He stood

killed Lantzy.

11

When the security guard arrived, he gave the

12

gun to his security guard, and said that he had killed

13

Lantzy .
The police arrived, and Engle described the

14
15

sheeting in detail, and said that he had ceased firing

16

because he didn't want tc hurt anyone else.

17

day, he gave the same version to the police officers in

18

writin g .

19

Now, the respondent --

20

QUESTION;

The next

Hr. Caruso, what are these -- which

21

of the points you want to raise are these facts being

22

urged

in support of?
MB. CARUSCs

23

These facts are being urged in

24

support cf the fact that if this is error, it's harmless

25

error,

beyond a reasonable doubt.

The respondent at trial testified that he did

2

not remember the incident.

3

a defense of insanity, the irresistible impulse prcng of

4

the Michigan insanity defense.

5

What he did do was interpose

New, in Sandstrcm, the Court instructed, the

6

law presumes that a person intends the natural

7

consequences of his voluntary acts.

8

was given, and the Court said a juror may have

9

interpreted these words as a conclusive presumption, one

That instruction

10

overriding the presumption of innocence, and shifting

11

the burden of proof to defendant.

12

New, here, in the Engle case, the subject

13

instruction is not couched in mandatory terms; it is not

14

a mandated presumption that would in any way shift the

15

burden of proof.

16

process to the jury commenting on the relevant evidence.

17

What is dees suggest is a reasoning

And you'll see, at page 13a cf the Joint

18

Appendix, the wording that was used by the judge in

19

instructing the jury;

20

power to look into a person's mind to tell what the

21

person is thinking cf at any particular time, but the

22

law gives a rule of thumb that a person is presumed to

23

intend the natural consequences of his acts.

24
25

We, cf course, do not have the

Then it gees cn tc say;

Therefore, in

determining whether there was an intent to kill, ycu may

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

properly consider that a gun was used.

You may properly

2

consider the wounds, where the gun was held in relation

3

to the tody, and I think it is proper that you may

4

consider all these things in determining whether or not

5

there wan an intent to kill.

6

However, the Court did admonish the jury --

7

QUESTION;

Hr. Solicitor General, could I

8

interpret you for a rather important problem that

9

bothers me, if I may?
There are three questions in this case.

10
11

You've argued the Wainwright against Sykes, and now

12

you're arguing whether there was an Sandstrcm error.
Eut your first question that you presented and

13
.14

discussed in your opening brief was whether Sandstrcm

15

was retroactive.

16

MR. CAEUSC:

17

QUESTION;

Yes.
And yccr opponents say, in their --

18

page 7 of their brief — that you did not argue that

19

question in either the District Court or the Court of

20

Appeals.
And I don't find that you filed a reply brief.

21

Are you agreeing you did net raise that

22
<

23
24
25

questi on?
ME. CARUSO;

That is correct. We did net raise

that question.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1
2

CBESTICN*

So that’s why you’re not arguing

the retroactivity clause.

3

MR. CARUSC:

4

Therefore, the Court then went on to admonish

Yes.

We did not.

5

the jury that they had to he satisfied with the proof

6

beyond a reasonable doubt.

7

In addition to that presumed intent

8

instruction, the Court did tell the jury and instruct

9

the jury on the six elements of homocide.

And in

10

instructing the jury on the six elements of homocide, it

11

told the jury that the prosecution had to prove each one

12

of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and then

13

had to also prove malice.
Now, instructions are only a component part of

14
15

the entire trial.

It is given, usually, in the main, at

16

the conclusion of the testimony and presentation of

17

exhibits.

18

the instruction in light cf the entire record, tc

19

determine the impact that a particular instruction dees

20

have on the outcome.

But for that reason, it’s necessary to review

And it’s our contention that this presumed

21
22

instruction that is claimed to be infirm did not have

23

any adverse impact cn the cutccme here, although intent

24

was technically in dispute during the course of the

25

trial.

It was actually subsidiary tc the claim cf

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

insanity, which was the fecal point cf the trial.

The

2

proofs took up entirely, almost entirely, the time of

3

the jury with proofs on insanity.

4

They did not dispute the general intent.

5

matter of fact, during the course of the trial, in

6

response to a question from the prosecuting attorney on

7

cross examination of the defendant Engle, at the

8

transcript at Volume III, page 314;

9

you're telling this jury that you don't know who killed

10

Regis Iantzy?

"Tcu don't knew --

Is that correct?

"No, that's too much.

11

As a

Too many witnesses said

12

that I did it.

13

trying to justify doing it.

14

didn't know what I was doing it when I did it.

15

remember doing it.

16

isn't any justification for the taking another man's

17

life,

18
19
20

I'm not denying doing it.

I'm net even

I'm just telling you 1
I don’t

I'm not trying to justify me.

There

unless it's in self defense."
Now, this is the tone that the evidence took

in this entire trial.
New, with respect to the insanity defense, the

21

insanity instruction, that left no doubt that the jury

22

was fully apprised as to its fact-finding function and

23

the prosecution's burden.

24
25

In that particular instruction, the Court said
the presumption of insanity is a legal presumption

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

merely.

It lasts only until seme evidence is introduced.
That merely states the Michigan law that

2
3

insanity is an affirmative defense.

4

it, but you don’t have to put any great body of proofs.

5

It’s simply, merely a burden of production.

6

that is put in, then the prosecutor has the burden of

7

proving sanity.

8

9

proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.

10

Ycu have to raise

And crce

And the Court actually did instruct the

And that statement is contained in the

11

insanity instruction.

12

as to the jury’s duty in the fact-finding function, and

13

also in view of that language, it cannot be argued, it

14

cannot be said that the jury was misled by thse

15

ins tru otic ns in believing that the instruction giver,

16

was — had the effect of shifting the burden of proof

17

from the prosecutor to the defendant.

18

did not happen.

19

QUESTION:

Accordingly, there was no doubt

Mr. Caruso, the conviction here was

20

first degree murder, wasn’t it?

21

MR. CARUSCi

22

QUESTION*

23
24
25

And that simply

Yes.
What were the instructions on first

degree murder?
MR. CARUSO*

On first degree murder, the

instructions read that there had to be a proof of

argument in this case from both sides really bear on

lesser defenses, wculd it net?

KB. CARUSO:

I don't -- I didn't follow that.
QUESTION :

12

The instruction tear — the
I'm sorry.

Well, you don't make the argument,

13

and I wonder why you don't -- it seems to me that the

14

instructions on first degree murder were very specific

15

as to premeditation and intent.

16

HR. CARUSO:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.
And that Sandstrom error, when

18

existent, hardly bears on the instructions on first

1

degree murder and the resulting conviction cn first

20

degree murder.

21

MR. CARUSO:

That is right.

22

And the instruction was given; it was very

23

clearly given.

And the instructions that were given

24

with respect to malice and the various components of

25

second

degree murder was also very clearly given, and --

9

Yes; that is correct.

Then I wonder why we’re so

concerned about Sandstrom error.
MR. CARUSC;

10

I don’t believe we should be

11

concerned about Sandstrom error, because in this case,

12

as I say, the instruction that was given does not --

13

would

14

burden of proof with respect to the elements of first

15

degree murder -- premeditation, intent to kill,

16

malice — was in any way led to believe that the

prosecutor did not have that burden of proof.

clear had the burden.

The Court began by telling the jury that

This instruction, particularly the instruction

18

that the law gives us a rule of thumb that a person is

20

affect the first degree premeditated murder finding.
The jury in this case, for example, could have

21
22

found,

from Mr. Engle's act of bringing a gun to the

from that act, together with the presumption of law the

11

his consciousness tc the point where he would not have

I'd ask Your Honors to note that that appears

14

on pages 359 through 361 cf the transcripts, net 36C as

15

I stated in my brief.

16

Regarding Hr. Engle's apparent ability tc

17

function during this period, tc walk and talk, even the

18

State's psychiatrist conceded, at page 420 of his

19

testimony, that when a breakdown of this type occurs,

20

somnambulistic behavior similar to sleepwalking and

21

sleeptalking, is possible, in which an individual may

22

say and do things, but not be fully consciously aware of

23

what they are doing.

24
25

And, Chief Justice Burger, with regard tc your
question regarding the statements, Dr. Ainsley

happened during this period cf time, as you cr I might

why, even though he was net conscious at the time, he

With regard tc the fact that Mr. Engle had a

gun with him on this night, he himself testified that

months before this, and that after that he bought a

15

pistol and carried it with him wherever he went for

In Detroit, I’d say that would be very

While there is certainly evidence supporting

20

the State's position that this was a premeditated

regarding Mr. Engle's mental state that presented a

QUESTION;

1

I would appreciate, just in a word,

2

why you think Sandstrom is retroactive in a case like

3

this.

4

HE. NUSSBAUMER;

For three reasons«

First of

5

all, Sandstrom was designed to eliminate the use cf jury

6

instructions which created a substantial danger that the

7

jury would either conclusively presume or presume,

8

absent proof to the contrary, the element cf intent,
eliminating the prosecution's burden of proof which you

Yes; against erroneous

factual error.
In addition to that, your past decisions

kind of an instruction.

You're correct.

Together, Winship and Morissette, Winship, of

18

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. NUSSBAUMER:

14
15

That's too many.
I wanted to make one final

point with regard tc the harmless error issue.
If intent was such an inconsequential and

16

peripheral part of this case, and if these instructions

17

were sc minor and had no role in the case, why, then,

18

did the trial court go to the lengths it did to inundate

19

this jury with all cf these presumptions, all relating

20

to the question of intent?

21

And, equally important, why did the trial

22

prosecutor repeatedly urge the jury, throughout his

23

closing argument, on no less than three occasions, tc

24

rely on Mr. Engle's acts in determining his intent,

25

using language virtually identical tc the natural

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

consequences presumption that the Court would ultimately

2

use in its instructions?

3

I submit that the answer is that both the

4

trial court and the trial prosecutor knew that the

5

question of intent in this case was a hotly-disputed

6

matter, an issue on which the jury could go either way,

7

and they both wanted to make sure that, in resclvirg the

8

factual dispute before them, these jurors applied these

9

presum pt ions .
