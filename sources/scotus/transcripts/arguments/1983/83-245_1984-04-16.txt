ORAL ARGUMENT CF BARUCH A. FELLNER, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MB. FELLNER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

10

please the Court, this case is on appeal from the Ninth

11

Circuit holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional with

12

respect to its brief retroactive period.

13

in making the statute in question retroactive, Congress

14

met the rationality standard under the Turner Elkhcrn

15

case,

16

He submit that

and acted in accord with tax law precedent.
The statute at issue, the Multi-Employer

17

Pension Plan Amendments Act of

18

approximately a year and a half of Congressional

19

deliberation in order tc improve the financial stability

20

of over 2,000 multi-employer plans covering

21

approximately eight million participants.

1980 was passed after

22

Congress perceived that the greatest threat to

23

plan stability was employer withdrawals, particularly in

24

declining industries.

25

Congress called a downward spiral.

Such withdrawals cause what

3

They reduce the

1

amount of contributions which support retirement

2

benefits, necessitating higher contributions from

3

remaining employers, and thereby cauterizing their

4

withdrawals from these plans, obviously jeopardizing the

5

plan's solvency.

6

Now, Congress was aware of the fact that as of

7

1978,

8

participants were experiencing financial difficulties,

9

and therefore, in order to achieve the goal of overall

10 percent of all plans covering about 1.3 million

10

multi-employer plan stability. Congress rationally

11

sought to eliminate what it observed were the incentives

12

encouraging the flight from plans, and to cushion the

13

financial impact of such withdrawals.

14

The Multi-Employer Act assesses against a

15

withdrawing employer a reasonable share of the costs of

16

funding retirement benefits.

17
18

QUESTION;

We submit --

What do we mean,

exactly, Mr.

Fellner, by the term "withdrawing employer?"

19

MR. FELLNER;

A withdrawing employer is an

20

employer who has contributed to a multi-employer plan

21

and chooses to, as defined under the statute, cease his

22

obligations, cease contributing to a multi-employer

23

plan.

24
25

QUESTION:
contractually?

Well, now, how does that come about

The next time the collective bargaining

U

1

agreement is up, the employer just says, I won't agree

2

to make any contributions to the pension fund?

3

MR. FELLNER:

There are a variety of

4

circum stances.

5

bargaining agreement.

6

as a result of simply closing a business or selling a

7

business.

8

circumstances under which withdrawals dc in fact occur

9

under

10

One, the expiration of the collective
A withdrawal can also be incurred

A variety of different and I dare say complex

the statute,

not necessarily linked to the

collective bargaining agreement.

11

Now, Congress, we submit, rationally concluded

12

that withdrawing employers should pay their fair share

13

of the unfunded liabilities they leave behind rather

14

than shifting those liabilities to remaining employers,

15

to employers who continue tc contribute to

16

multi-employer plans.

17

we submit, was the cornerstone of the legislative

18

recommendations submitted at the request of Congress by

19

the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on February 27,

20

1979.

21

Withdrawal liability therefore,

From that date forward, every bill, every

22

Committee report incorporated a retroactive date, and

23

that was in order to eliminate the incentive to withdraw

24

during the legislative process.

25

that it was the very openness and thoroughness of the

5

Indeed, I would submit

1

legislative process which necessitated the retroactive

2

period.

3

retroactively where to do otherwise --

Congress was rational in legislating

4

QUESTION;

Hr. Fellner, may I ask one

5

questi on ?

It is a little bit like Justice Rehnq uist ’s

6

in a w ay.

Could you just, when it is convenient for

7

you , k ind of explain to me how the magnitude of the

8

w i t hd r awal liability is calculated?

9

ME. FELLNER;

Withdrawal liatility is

10

calculated as follows. Justice Stevens.

11

proportion cf the unfunded vested benefits.

12

vested benefits are defined as the actuarial present

13

value cf the retirement benefits that have to be paid

14

over time.

15

QUESTION;

It is a
Unfunded

Now, is that of the entire unfunded

16

vested benefits or just the employees for whom the

17

particular employers contributed?

18

MR. FELLNER;

It is roughly equivalent tc the

19

contributions which the employer has made up to that

20

point.

21

computed, the amount by which this actuarial equivalent

22

or the actuarial amount of unfunded vested benefits

23

exceeds the assets available to pay them over time is

24

multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the

25

contributions which the employer has made ever a

If I may describe the manner in which' it is

6

1

five-year period, the denominator of which is the

2

contributions made by all employers to this plan over

3

the same five-year period.

4

And therefore, as we suggest in our brief, it

5

is the rough equivalent of the contributions this

6

employer has made up to that point.

7

QUESTION:

What is the — I may just show my

8

ignorance here, but I might as well show it now rather

9

than later, I guess.

What is the typical collective

10

bargaining agreement provision that an employer enters

11

into with a union?

12

pension liability to a retired employee, but simply to

13

pay a certain contribution per employee?

14

It is not to ultimately pay a

KB. FELLNER:

The typical collective

15

bargaining agreement I think is difficult to describe.

16

Let me answer the question as fellows.

17

decided the case Amex Coal.

18

agreement bound the trustees to the negotiated benefits

19

in the collective bargaining agreement.

20

collective bargaining agreements and trust agreements

21

take different forms.

22

have described. Justice Rehnquist, namely that employers

23

do negotiate only the contributions which they

24

ultimately make.

25

This Court

In Amex Coal, the trust

In other words,

Many of them are precisely as you

However, there are other trust agreements

7

1

which bind the trustees to the negotiated for benefits

2

in the collective bargaining agreements, one example of

3

which is Amex Coal.

4

QUESTION;

5

bind the employers?

6
7

.8
9
10

But now do those agreements also

MR. FELLNER;

Clearly.

They bind the

employers with regard to the contributions which they
make which support specific benefits either provided for
in the

trust agreements or provided for explicitly in

the collective bargaining agreement.

11

QUESTION;

But the typical collective

12

bargaining agreement doesn't contain a provision whereby

13

an employer promises to pay any individual employee a

•14

pension of so much at the time he retires.

15

MR. FELLNER;

That is correct, but the

16

realities of collective bargaining we submit, however,

17

and describe in detail in cur brief, are such that these

18

contributions are clearly not negotiated in a vacuum.

19

They are negotiated with an eye toward the benefits

20

which

they will support.

21

Now, we submit that Congress was —

22

QUESTION;

May I ask just one other question

23

if I could, because I think I have the concept in mind

24

now.

25

withdrawal liability that these three companies

With respect to the amount that the -- the
«

8

1

incurred, how did that amount compare with the total

2

contributions they had made during the preceding

3

five-year period?

4

KB. FELLNER;

Let me first make one minor

5

correction if I may, Justice Stevens.

6

this morning is one company.

7

8

QUESTION:

Before the Court

Well, the three cases discussed in

the Ninth Circuit opinion.

9

MR. FELLNER;

That's correct.

With regard to

10

the company which is before the Court this morning, and

11

then I

12

with regard to Gray Construction Company, Gray was

13

assessed a $201,000 withdrawal liability.

14

altnerative, it was offered the opportunity to pay

15

$65,000 a year, which was almost the precise equivalent

16

of the contributions which it had been making over the

17

prior five year.

QUESTION;

In the

roughl y?

20

MR. FELLNER;

21

QUESTION;

That is correct.

So that in five years about

22

$300,000 he had contributed, and he has to come up with

23

another $200,000.
MR. FELLNER;

24
25

That's correct.

that —

Now, we submit

1
2

QUESTION:

And is that typical of the other

two, also?

3

MR. FELLNERs

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. FELLNERs

Yes, it is.

They are roughly the same ratio?
We submit that Congress was

6

therefore rational in legislating retroactively where to

7

do otherwise could indeed have precipitated the very

8

conduct that Congress intended to restrain.

9

Now, under the Turner Elkhorn rationality

10

doctrine, Congress’s reasonable decision in this case

11

to, as it were, protect the efficacy of this complex

12

legislation through a brief retroactive period is

13

entitled to judicial deference.

14

below,

15

controls the disposition of the constitutional issues

16

before

17

measured the liability imposed on withdrawing

18

employers.

Contrary to the court

three circuit courts upheld that Turner Elkhorn

this Court, and furthermore, Congress carefully

19

It enacted numerous moderating provisions.
Just several examples. It lessened most

20

employers’

21

particularly aiming that prevision at small employers.

22

It enacted a net worth limitation on the liability of an

23

employer which sells or closes its business.

24

specifically reduced the impact of retroactivity on

25

certain employers, and it stretched out payments over as

withdrawal liability by as much as £50,000,

10

It

1

much as 20 years and made them, as Justice Stevens

2

pointed out, the rough equivalent of prior

3

con tributions.

4

Moreover, under the Act withdrawing employers

5

bear only a part of the cost of plan stability.

6

Participants, the pensioners, the retirees suffer losses

7

because the levels of benefits now guaranteed under the

8

Multi-Employer Act are lower than the levels guaranteed

9

under prior law.

They, too, suffer losses.

Remaining

10

employers share the cost of plan stability as well,

11

because the Multi-Employer Act provides for faster

12

funding, necessitating higher contributions from these

13

who continue to participate and contribute to

14

multi-employer plans.
Covered plans in general shoulder the

15
16

additional burdens of higher premiums which are phased

17

in from a 50 cent per employee premium to $2.60, and as

18

one court put it. Congress spread the pain around.

19

the rationality of retroactivity here is further

20

supported --

21

QUESTION»

Now,

Mr. Fellner, when you say that, it

22

spread the pain around, it did keep advancing the date,

23

didn't it?

24

MR. FELLNERs

25

QUESTION;

That is correct.

And what, under political pressure

11

1

by organizations with clout?

2

that?

HR. FELLNER;

How do you apologize for

I don't apologize for it,

Justice Plackmun.

is described by appellee and his nine amici. We submit

6

that it was not political pressure, but it was a

7

realization as described by Senator Bentsen on April

8

29th on the floor of the Senate.

9

realization, rather, that it had done much of its work

I know that that is precisely hew it

It was an attempt, a

10

already retroactively.

11

original package, was February 27,

1979.

12

February 27,

1980, Congress

13

concluded that retroactivity had done its job.

14

Retroactivity is part of the

1979, and April 23th,

Eetween

In addition, it underscores the rationality of

15

Congress's decision, because Congress took into

16

consideration the fact that some employers had embarked

17

on a course of action prior to February 27th which would

18

lead to their ultimate withdrawal, and Congress tcck

19

that fairness factor into consideration, concluding that

20

it would be unfair to retroactively attach liability to

21

employers who even before this package was submitted to

22

Congress and recommendations were submitted to Congress,

23

that it would be unfair for them to have retroactive

24

liability attached to them.

5

Now, I would like to dwell, if I may, Justice

6

Elackm un , a little bit more on this histori cal conte xt,

7

becaus e we submit that it d ces support the rationality

8

of wha t Congress did here.

9

loud and clear when ERISA was passed in 1974, it was

If one message came through

10

that employers involved in defined benefit plans were

11

responsible for the funding of those plans.

12

could employers walk away scctt free, as Senator

13

Matsunaga put it, leaving other employers holding the

14

bag even where they had contractually limited their

15

liability to specified contributions.

16

No longer

Now, the full extension of this principle to

17

the multi-employer plan world was delayed by the

18

Congress in order to allow thorough analysis of the

19

special problems which are inherent in such plans, and

20

therefore beginning in 1977, Congress passed legislation

21

on four different occasions which delayed the full

22

implementation of the existing program to multi-employer

23

contributing employers, alerting those employers that

24

changes in the existing program should be anticipated,

25

and therefore even before withdrawal liability and its

13

1

retroactive feature were considered by the Congress for

2

a

3

industry, in this heavily regulated area, were given a

4

full opportunity to knew that Congress was examining

5

alternative legislative solutions to the problem of

6

multi-employer plans’

17-month period, employers in this heavily regulated

7

instability.

Now, once the legislative process began, we

8

submit, employers were then on further notice that

9

Congress was strongly considering changing their

10

contingent liability under the old statute to a fixed

11

liability, and that Congress was considering

12

specifically making that liability retroactive.

13

Therefore, against this backdrop of six years

14

of regulation under ERISA, of

15

the Multi-Employer Act, and given what we submit was the

16

inexorability of the legislative process by April 29th,

17

1980,

18

already approved identical legislation and a fourth

19

Committee headed by Senator Bentsen, who took the floor

20

and said, we need a little bit more time to approve it,

21

given all this historical context, withdrawing employers

22

were in a position to know at least that they could no

KR. FELLNER;

Me suspect -- Me submit that the legislative

history, given this legislative history, given the

10

considerations of Congress in terms of the need to

11

remove incentives,

12

from Turner Elkhorn, where the Court sustained a wholly

13

new and unanticipated liability.

14

perspective, the transaction which generated its

15

liability was entirely closed.

that this case follows a fortiori

Frcm Turner Elkhcrn's

Indeed, as Justice Powell pointed out in his

16
17

concurring opinion in Turner Elkhorn, the employment

18

relationship in some instances in that case had ceased

19

50 years earlier, notwithstanding which liability was

20

attached to Turner Elkhorn.
Now, the court below rejected the Turner

21
22

Elkhorn standard.

It relied instead on a contracts

23

clause case, Allied Structural Steel versus Spanous, on

24

a 1935 decision in Railroad Retirement Board versus

25

Alton,

and the latter case's continued vitality was

15

1

questioned by this Court in Turner Elkhcrn.

2

First, with regard to Allied, if I may for a

3

few minutes, it is clear that the contracts clause by

4

its terms is limited to state impairment of contract,

5

but even if the contract’s clause were somehow made

6

applicable, its principles were somehow imported into a

7

due process analysis, as the court below has suggested,

8

we submit that Allied is distinguishable from the case

9

at tar .

10

The lynch pin of the Court’s decision in

11

Allied was that the Minnesota statute there created new

12

rights where none had existed before, and in addition,

13

in the Energy Reserves decision which came down last

14

term,

15

applicability of Allied, because Allied was entering --

16

Minnesota was entering an area it had never before

17

sought to regulate.

18

it was clear that the Court narrowed the

Under these circumstances and under similar

19

circum stances described in cur brief, we submit that

20

Allied is completely distinguishable from the case at

21

bar, and similarly, the Alton Railroad decision created

22

a new pension scheme for railroad employees again where

23

none had existed before.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. TRIPLETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF CF THE APPELLEE

13
14

MR. TRIPLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

please the Court,

16

the questions that were put to Mr. Fellner.

17

whether these trusts are free to use the money that they

18

receive from payments on withdrawal liability for any

19

purpose.

20

probably part of their fiduciary responsibility to

21

utilize them to enhance benefits as opposed to reduce

22

withdrawal liability.

23

I would like to start by responding to

They are indeed free to do so.

One was

In fact, it is

Withdrawal liability is the obligation of a

24

withdrawing employer.

25

the trust are intended to be earmarked for the benefit

The moneys that are received by

of the beneficiary, and the larger the pool of money,

2

the greater the benefits that can be produced.

These trusts, particularly the one that is

before the Court today, make their own determinaticns

5

independent of any third party as to what level of

6

benefits they will sustain.

7

bargained. The only thing that was bargained in this

8

case was a rate contribution, and the only thing that

9

was bargained was the corresponding promise that that is

They are not collectively

10

our sole responsibility in entering into a trust

11

arrang ement.

12

Another question that was put was, could

13

Congress have based its actions upon the specific needs

14

of trusts.

15

all trusts are in trouble.

16

PEGC indicates that no more than 2 percent of the trusts

17

in this country are in financial difficulty, serious

18

financial difficulty that might lead ultimately, if

19

corrective actions were not taken --

20
21
22

In other words, counsel concedes that net

QUESTION:

In fact, the 1978 report of

How do you know which ones they

are ?

Apparently PEGC had this

information based on reporting forms that were filed

24

with it pursuant to the 1974 Act.

25

are required to file reports on an annual basis —

22

Each of the trusts

1

QUESTION i

Sc you think it would be perfectly

2

feasible to go around and in case of any particular

3

trust make a sensible judgment about whether it was

4

actuarially sound or net?

5

MR. TRIPLETT:

I think that's right.

In fact,

6

in this very legislation there is a provision that

7

applies to some segment of the trucking industry, and

8

what it provides is that when an employer withdraws from

9

a trust, PBGC will determine whether the withdrawal of

10

that specific employer impairs the contribution base of

11

the trust.

12

QUESTION:

That may be so, but what if -- I

13

suppose any trust that you would say is actuarially

14

sound,

15

judgment might change.

16

if a lot of employers suddenly withdrew, your

MR. TRIPLETT:

The actuaries are also

17

obligated to forecast the population of the trusts, and

18

they do this on an annual basis, and on an annual basis

19

they prepare reports based on the contribution base and

20

the number of employers and then project the cash flow

21

needs of the trust on a year by year basis.

22

What I was saying about the exception that

23

relates to a portion of the teamster trust is that the

24

mechanism that was permitted there is for PEGC to make a

25

determination at the time of withdrawal as to whether

23

1

the withdrawing employer had materially injured the

2

contribution base of the trust.

3

If it determined that/ then withdrawal

4

liability was imposed.

5

determination, then the law provided that a bond would

6

be put up by the employer in the amount of 50 percent of

7

the potential withdrawal liability.

8

five years cr prior to that time FBGC determined that

9

there had been an impairment to the contribution base of

If it did not make that

If at the end of

10

the trust, then it would impose withdrawal liability.

11

If at the conclusion of five years there was indeed no

12

impairment, then the bond was exonerated.

13

So, indeed,

there is a fashion by which

14

Congress could have acted to limit this law to those

15

trusts that required specific attention and where

16

withdrawal was indeed a problem.

17

PBGC's basic argument in this case is that

18

there was adequate public notice of the pendency of the

19

Act and its possile retroactive application.

20

it urges that April 29 was a rationally chosen date to

21

underscore the proposal to eliminate opportunists'

22

withdrawal.

23

process has been satisfied.

24
25

Secondly,

On those two grounds, it concludes that due

This argument proceeds on some false fact
assumptions.

First, was April 29 chosen in order to

avoid opportunists’ withdrawal?

5

was to favor certain employers who had already

withdrawn, that it was not chosen to further the goal of

preventing opportunistic withdrawal.

I think the answer is

Senator Javits on July 29, on the floor of the

Secondly, there is a suggestion that there was
a massive amount of public notice, and therefore in

10

perhaps a procedural due process type of way, we were

11

sufficiently alert to the prospect of retroactive

13

us.

14

Well, of course, if that criticism

4

(General laughter.)

5

MR. TRIPLETT;

The point that I am making is,

6

we urge this Court that there is a procedural due

7

process issue involved in applying a statute

8

retroactively, and that indeed, that under our concept

9

of due process, the employer here was entitled to

10

reasonable notice of a change in the law, and to be

11

given an opportunity to adjust his conduct tc what that

12

law would be.

13

QUESTION;

Mr. Triplett, that really -- the

14

normal presumption of any Congressional Act is that it

15

can be and is going to be applied as of the date that

16

Congress says it is going tc take effect,

17

though that date may be before enactment.

18

really remarkably few cases that have ever upheld a

19

challenge to an Act of Congress because of its

20

retroactive application.

thing,

16

25

retroactive.

come to a different conclusion, because they are dealing

with closed transactions.

6

basis between gift tax cases on the one hand and the

income tax cases on the other, the thesis is that a man

will continue to earn an income, but that a person might

not make a gift.

Turner Elkhorn

1

2

QUESTION:

Well, it's a law that was applied

retroactively to supposedly close transactions.

3

MR. TRIPLETT:

Turner Elkhorn did a couple of

4

things which this law does not do.

And it has

5

underpinnings which are different.

I think you start

6

off with the premise in Turner Elkhorn that the employer

7

contributed to the illness of its employees, the sole

8

and complete control of the work place.

9

that these employees were becoming ill because of the

10

It was known

conditions the employer created.

11

It was therefore felt not unfair with this

12

knowledge, that they were profiting on the illness of

13

their employees, to impose this rule of law.

14

QUESTION:

That is just a fairness argument.

15

I mean, as long as it is fair, you can make it

16

retroa ctive?

MR. TRIPLETT:

Then indeed it could be a

logical conclusion that an employer who terminates

23

In terms of this notice

7

question, this question which I view as a question of

fundamental fairness, IBGC itself acknowledged the

9

inability of certain employers to understand the effects

10

of this law, even though it had already been passed.

11

47 FR

12

employers who entered into a transaction a day or two

13

after September 26th, and it did so because, in its

14

words,

15

did not know or could not reasonably be expected to know

16

that sales transactions could be structured in such a

way as to avoid immediate withdrawal liability.

In

liability.

11

The other thing which I think it is very

12

important to recognize is, the employer in those cases

13

has the right to go to hearing to contest whether the

14

employee had in fact been harmed, whether he had black

15

lung disease.

16

order to recover that it be demonstrated that this

17

employee was harmed in his relationship with this

18

employer.

19

this law, this 1980 Act, does not depend upon whether

20

the trust has been harmed by the withdrawal of an

21

employer.

22

And so in that case it was incumbent in

Now, why do I say that is important?

Because

In fact, it may be a windfall.
Let me give you an example of that.

In --

23

Assume an employer who for five years is covered under a

24

collective bargaining agreement, and he is required to

25

make contributions to a trust.

34

At the expiration of

1

five years, his employees decertify the union.

2

under that example, none of the employees would have

3

vested.

4

employees are taxed upon the fund.

5

employer would be required not merely to have made his

6

five years of contributions, but a withdrawal liability

7

payment as well.

Ten-year vesting is required.

Mr. Triplett, let me just go back

MR. TRIPLETT:

16

Yes.

Wouldn’t that be equally

And part of the problem

17

of the windfall is noted in a footnote in cur brief, in

18

which we represented to this Court that two years after

19

we withdrew, the trust had paid all of its unfunded

20

liabilities.

21

the trust is fully paid.

It had none.

The trust has our money# but

Now, if indeed there is an implied condition

22
23

within

this statute that states that we are entitled to

24

our money back, then the constitutional issue in this

25

case is moot, but if indeed there is no such implied

35

1

condition, it demonstrates the massive unfairness of the

2

rules.

3

I think that in terms of dealing with the

4

question of retroactive liability that this Court has

5

come perilously close to adopting a contract clause type

6

of analysis for legislation which deals with closed

7

transactions.

8

synonymous, but in attempting to distill the principles

9

that appear to have been applied, they appear to closely

It has never held that the two are

10

parallel one another.

11

under the contract clause what you are doing is

12

disrupting a prior transaction.

13

I think that not surprising since

And in consequence, it would appear to me

14

under the Fifth Amendment that the analysis with respect

15

to closed transactions should be the same.

16

QUESTION;

But that is kind of a contradiction

17

of the text of the Constitution, isn't it?

18

framers pretty well hashed this out, and they applied

19

prohibition against impairment cf contracts to the

20

states and the denial of due process prohibition against

21

the federal government.

22

ME. TRIPLETT;

I mean, the

the analytical tools that underscore a contract clause

analysis apply equally to a Fifth Amendment analysis

with respect to retroactive application to a closed

tra nsa ction

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRIPLETT:

Why should that be?
I don't think that there is a

4

restraint with respect to the language of the

5

Constitution when it is borne in mind that when

6

originally written it was thought that only the states

7

would be in the business of regulating contracts, and

8

secondly --

9

QUESTION :

But I think that is a very good

10

reason for bearing it in mind.

11

that only the states are going to be in the business of

12

regulating contracts, and therefore will apply this

13

prohibition to them and not to the federal government,

14

and the federal government later gets a lot more active

15

and bigger, surely that doesn't mean that you simply

16

say, well, I think the framers would have wanted this to

17

apply to the federal government if they had only known

18

how big it was going to get, so we as Judges will apply

19

it.

MR. TRIPLETT:

If the framers thought

that a greater restraint should be imposed on the states
