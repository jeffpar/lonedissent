ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. SPOONER, ESQ.,

4

ON

5

BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. SPOONER*

Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it

6 please the Court:
This case presents two important issues of

7

8 interpretation under the Federal Arbitration Act.
9

preliminary

A

question regarding the Court's jurisdict ion

10

to hear the case has also been raised, and

I will

11

address that point at the outset of ray argument.

12

On the merits the two issues are first whe the r

13

the states are free to enact statutory exceptions to th e

14

Federal Arbitration

15

arbitration agreements that

16

irrevocable and enforceable under the specific terms of

17

Section 2 of the federal statute.

18

whether the states are free to engraft their judicia 1

19

class action procedures ontc private arbitrations

20

involving interstate commerce being conducted pursua nt

21

to the

Act thereby striking down
would otherwise be valid

The second issue is

Federal Arbitration Act.
The issues in this case arose in the folic win g

22

The Plaintiff Appellees are former franchisees of

23

way:

24

7-Eleven convenient stores in the State of Californi

25

They alleged that their franchisor, the

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 62M300

3

•

1

Southland Corporation, violated the terms of the

2 franchise agreement with respect to certain of its
3

bookkeeping procedures and also that it did not fully

4

disclose to them at the time they became franchisees the

5 types of procedures that it would use in preparing
6 financial statements fcr their stores.
7

They claimed

that Southland’s actions and inactions constituted a

8 breach of contract, a breach of a fiduciary duty, a
9

common law fraud, and a violation of the state's

10 franchise investment law which requires franchisors to
11

make certain types of disclosures to their respective

12 franchisees.
13
14

These cases were filed in court
notwithstanding a bread forum arbitration clause in the

15 franchise agreement, and the Plaintiffs have resisted
16

arbitration.

This effort has been successful so far

17

because they have convinced the California Supreme Ccurt

18

that it is contrary to the public policy of the state’s

19

franchise invesment law to require franchisees to

20 arbitrate claims that they base on that statute.
21

They have also convinced the California

22 Supreme Court with respect tc the clearly arbitrable
23

claims, the common law, breach of contract and fraud

24

claims, to remand the cases not to an arbitrator but

25

back to the trial court so that the court can conduct

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-8300

1

class certification proceedings and thereafter to

2

supervise any arbitration which is held to be

3 appropriate for class-wide adjudication.
4
5

We have brought this case here under Section
1257 of the judicial code.

The Plaintiffs have argued

6 that jurisdiction is lacking because the decision below
7

allegedly does not constitute a final judgment.
They base this argument on the fact that the

8
9

California Supreme Court contemplates that extensive

10

judicial proceedings are yet to come in the trial

11

court.

I submit if it may please the Court that that is

12 precisely the point that the parties agreed to arbitrate
13

this case in a nonjudicial forum and that is where we

14

ought to be.

15

The evil, if I may use that term, of the

16 California Supreme Court's decision is precisely that it
17

is compelling extensive judicial proceedings to occur in

18

the trial court.

19

Court uses to determine finality we think that the

Under the practical tests that this

20 decision is clearly final because it decides important
21

issues under a federal statute in a definitive way.

22 These issues are collateral to the merits of the case
23

and in addition the decision is final in the sense that

24 if this Court reverses the decision of the Court below
25 the judicial proceedings clearly will be at an end.

QUESTIONS

1

The class arbitration issue was

2 certainly not clearly raised below was it?
MR. SPOONERs

3
4

below.

Your Honor#

it was raised

We stated the issue in the California Supreme

5 Court as follows;

Whether a court may enter an order

6 compelling the private commercial arbitration governed
7 by the Federal Arbitration Act and the rules of the

8 American Arbitration Association to proceed as a class
9

action.
The Plaintiffs have argued strenuously in

10

\

11

their brief in this Court that we did not litigate this

12

issue as a federal question# but I submit that that

13 claim is a red herring.

What happened was that the

14

parties all stipulated in the court below that this case

15

involved interstate commerce and thus the federal Act

16 applied .

Our argument was that arbitration and class

17
18

actions were fundamentally incompatible with one another

19 and, therefore, if you superimposed class action
20

procedures which would necessarily involve extensive

21

judicial involvement onto a private arbitration you

22 would in essence be destroying the arbitration
23

proceeding as the nonjudicial procedure it was itended

24 to be.
25

We also —

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Spooner, do you think that

2

Congress intended the Federal Arbitration Act to govern

3

procedings in state courts?

4
5

HE. SPOONER:

It did not intend the Federal

Arbitration Act to govern procedures in state court

6 relating to arbitration.

QUESTION:

7

For example, —

Do you think it intended the

8

Federal Arbitration Act to apply to state courts at

9

all?
HR. SPOONER:

10

Yes, in the sense that the state

11

courts are required to enforce the Federal Arbitration

12

Act just as the federal courts are.

13

Moses Cohen Hopsital case last term specifically held

14

that.
QUESTION:

15

Did it hold that?

16

Cohen came from a federal ccurt.

17

HR. SPOONER:

I thought Hoses

It did. Your Honor.

18

from a federal court, but --

19

QUESTION:

20

This Court in the

It came

I thought a holding was something

that was necessary to the disposition of a case.
MR. SPOONER:

21
22 corrected.

Well, Your Honor, I stand

The Court did state several points in its

23

opinion and I may — It may not have been the holding of

24

the decision, but the Court emphasized that the Federal

25

Arbitration Act establishes a substantive right in favor

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of arbitration and that this substantive right prevails

2 over any state substantive or procedural policies tc the
3 contrary.
4

QUESTIONS

5

MR. SPOONERs

6
7

But it was dicta, was it not?
I think that is correct. Your

Honor .
Turning to the first of the issues presented

8 here on the merits, the question is whether the states

are free to enact statutory exceptance to the Federal
10 Arbitration Act.
11
12

We believe that the court was clearly

incorrect in so holding.
The Federal Arbitration Act was specifically

13 designed to overrule state policies and legislation
14

which would do precisely what the California statute

15 does in this case.
16

QUESTION*

Section 2 —
Well is the evidence of the

17 congressional intent not somewhat indicative that it
18 only intended it tc imply in federal courts?
1

The

problem came I suppose with Erie v. Thompkins and all of

20 that, but the evidence of what Congress intended is
21
22
23

pretty clearly against you.
MR. SPOONERs

Your Honor, I do not agree that

the evidence is clearly against us.

The procedural

24 protections in many of the sections of the Federal
25

Arbitration Act speak to what the United States courts

8

ALD EPSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B4300

1

should do if proceedings relating to arbitration are

2 brought in the United States courts.
3

However, Section 2 of the federal statute

4

specifically says without limiting the protection of the

5

statute to any particular courts that arbitration

6 agreements involving maritime trade or interstate
7 commerce shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable

8 save on such grounds as exist at law or in equity for
9

the revocation of any contract.

What Congress did in

10

this section was to broadly declare that these contracts

11

shall be upheld and they shall be enforced except on

12 grounds that apply to any contract such as waiver or
13

duress in a particular case.
But if a contract satisfies those general

14
15

doctrines of contract formation, Section 2 of the

16

Federal Arbitration Act says that that contract must be

17 enforced.

I think also that if Section 2 were read

18

otherwise very unfortunate results would occur because

19

the enforceability of an arbitration agreement in

20

interstate commerce would depend on the forum in which

21

enforcement was sought.

22

That would lead to forum shopping and would

23

destroy the predictability in interstate commercial

24

dealings that is so important.

25

that arbitration agreements in interstate commerce shall

Section 2 does not say

9
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 625-0300

1

be enforceable unless the states provide otherwise, and

2

we do not think it can logically be read in that

3

fashion .
If it were, states could undermine the entire

4

5 policy of the Act merely by creating a cause of action

6 in which they say that you cannot arbitrate this claim.
7 I think, this case presents a pretty good example of
8

precisely that problem.
The Plaintiffs' claim in this case is

10 essentially a breach of contract and a fraud claim.
11

They say that their franchisor mislead them and failed

12 to disclose material facts.

The common law fraud claim is clearly

13
14

arbitrable and the statutory claim is indistinguishable

15 in terms of its elements, in terms of its basic nature
18

from the common law claim.

Yet what the Appellees are

17 arguing in this case is that if the legislature cf
18 California chooses to say that you cannot arbitrate this
1

kind of claim then what would otherwise be valid and

20

enforceable under the federal statute ceases to become

21

so.

22

The Plaintiffs' argument on this issue really

23 boils down to stating that Congress has occasionally
24 adopted exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act when
25 it has passed various types of federal legislation sc

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

why should the states not be free to do so.

Well the

2

answer to that is simply that the Supremacy Clause

3

applies to the states and it does not control what

4 Congress can do.
5

What Congress gives it can take away, but the

6 states cannot take away what Congress has made valid and
7 enforceable in a federal statute.
8

There are obvious

policy differences as well between exceptions to a

9 protective federal statute like this where the
10
11

exceptions are created by Congress and the states.
Congress when it is considering adopting an

12

exception can carefully balance the different

13

considerations and can keep the scope of the exceptions

14

within very narrow limits, but when each of 50

15

individual states are permitted to adopt exceptions the

16

scope of those exceptions will become virtually

17

uncontrolled.

18

policy point of view is that any exceptions adopted by

19

Congress will apply uniformly throughout the United

20

States and parties that enter into arbitration

21

agreements will be able to predict whether those

22

agreements are going to be enforced or not with respect

23

to particular kinds of claims.

24
25

The other important difference from a

But if each state can decide for itself when
these agreements are going to be enforced and when they

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 6284300

1

are not that predictability would be lost.

2 Plaintiffs’

The

position in this case or rather I should say

3

the California legislation in this case as interpreted

4

by the State Supreme Court reflects we think a basic

5

mistrust for arbitration.
The underlying notion of their argument seems

6

7 to be that arbitration is somehow going to be a vehicle
8

that is going to allow the party with the superior

9

resources to defeat small claims.

I think that that

10 basic premise is one that has to be challenged, that
11

arbitration is beneficial for everybody but particularly

12 beneficial when small claims and people with limited
13

resources are involved.
The party with the superior resources can

14

15 often litigate cases to death, can take full advantage
16

of discovery rules, string out the case forever and

17 frustrate small claims.

But if a party is free to bring

18

a case in arbitration he can get it tried promptly.

He

19

can devote the resources to it that it deserves, and he

20 can prevent the liberal discovery rules and the backlog
21

of the courts from frustrating getting a resolution cf

22

his claim.

23

QUESTION;

Nr. Spooner, what if the California

24 legislature had felt very strongly contrary perhaps
25

perversely contrary to the way you are now speaking and

12

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

felt that arbitration was just simply a trap for the

2

unwary and, therefore, it said that no contractual

3

undertaking in this state providing for arbitration

4

shall be enforced.

5

the well, so to speak, after the Federal Arbitration

6

Act?

Do you think that is just all down

7

HR. SPOONEEi

8

QUESTION*

9

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

What if Congress adopted a statute

called the Federal Confession of Judgment Statute

10

providing that there should be confessions of judgment

11

permissible in all proceedings in federal or state

12 courts and lots of states I guess have a policy against
13

confessions of judgment because they regard them as

14

pretty one-sided.

15

Congress said so?
MR. SPOONER*

16
17

No problem about enforcing that if

Well, it is a question of

whether that legislation would be within the proper

18 scope of Congress*

power to legislate in interstate

19

commerce, and if it were a constitutional exercise of

20

its power certainly it would overrule any contrary

21

legislation enacted by the individual states.
With regard to the Federal Arbitration Act, I

22
23 think

that this Court held in the Prima Paint case that

24

the statute clearly is a proper exercise of Congress'

25

power to legislate in the area of interstate commerce.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

If I may turn to the second issue which is

1

2

presented here for review, the class action issue, what

3

the Court held was that this case should go back to the

4

trial court even with respect to claims that are clearly

5

subject to arbitration, the nonfranchise investment law

6 claims, so that the court could conduct class

7 certification proceedings.

QUESTION*

8

9 here?

Hr. Spccner, may I interrupt you

You started out to tell us a little bit about

10 jurisdiction and the final judgment question, but I
11

really did not understand your argument on why this

12 portion of the judgment is final.
13

You are just starting out about all the

14 proceedings that are going to take place on remand.
15

I

think maybe you ought to be sure you have covered

16 everything you want to say on that.
17

MR. SPOONERs

The decision on both issues is

18 final. Justice Stevens, and

with respect to this one in

19 particular we think that it is final for two reasons.
20

First of all, a specific California statute, Section

21

1294 of the California Code of Civil Procedure,

22

specifically states that if a petition to compel

23

arbitration is denied the party has to take its appeal

24

immedia tely.

25

So Southland took its appeal at the juncture

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

in this case when it was compelled to do so as a matter

2

of California law.

3

is that a class has not been certified yet in this case

Secondly, the Plaintiffs* argument

4 and that Southland may be able to convince the trial

5

court not to certify a class and, therefore, we do net

6

have a final judgment.
What this misses, I think, is that the issue

7

8 here is more fundamental than that.

Even if at the end

9 of judicial class certification proceedings Southland
10

were able to defeat the class, it would have been

11

required to go through many months of very highly

12

judicial proceedings which would be enmeshed with the

13

underlying merits of the case.
This Court has stressed that class

14
15

certification issues requrie a very careful inquiry into

16

the nature of the claims that are involved in the case

17

and the type of evidence that would be presented at a

18

trial.

Therefore, what inevitably happens in these

19 cases is that the parties take detailed discovery to
20

explore that issue.
They brief the issue extensively to the

21

22 Court.

The Court often holds an evidentiary hearing on

23

the issue, and this Court has held that evidentiary

24

hearings may be required in some instances.

25

decision is rendered.

Then a

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIR3T ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Sow even if at the end of, this many months of

1

2 proceedings Southland were able to defeat the class, we
3

think that the decision of the California court here

4 opens up a judicial procedure which is in direct
5 contradiction of the policy of the Federal Arbitration

6 Act which as this Court said in the Moses Cohen case is
7 to move people out of court and into arbitration as
8 quickly and easily as possible.

QUESTION*

9

Is it not still true that the

10

alternatives on remand are several really as I

11

understand?

Cne is that they may allow the arbitration

12 to go forward under some kind of judicial supervision
13

with sort of a semi-class action.
Another is there would be no arbitration at

14
15

all.

Another is there would be an old-fashioned class

18

action .
I am not sure the issues are as clear cut as

17

18 you seem to describe them.

I do not know what is going

19 to happen when this case goes back on this issue.

Is that not the very reason we tend to

20
21

postpone review because we are trying to know exactly

22 what we are called upon to decide?

23

MR. SPCONER:

I do not think that the Court

24 would be free to say that there will be no arbitration
25 at all

with respect to claims.

16

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

QUESTION*

Well, as I understood it if you do

not consent to a class-type arbitration then they could

3 decline to arbitrate at all under the California Supreme
4 Court's opinion or did I misread it?

5
6

NR. SPOONER*

That is the implication of what

they would do, but our position on the merits is that

7 under the Federal Arbitration Act they do not have the
8 power to do that.

9

They do not have the power to do that

because the federal statute creates a right of the

10

parties to have their arbitration agreement enforced and

11

it is not the province of the court to decide in a

12

particular case that some other procedure would be mere

13 efficient.
14

Therefore —

15

QUESTION*

It is net within the province of

16

the trial court to construe the contract as authorizing

17

some kind of a joint arbitration with three or four

18 different franchisees?

KR. SPOONER*

19

If the contract provided for a

20 class-wide arbitration, then the issue would be could it
21

do so without violating principles of due process of

22 law.

There is no issue here in that regard because the

23 contract does not say anything about class action
24

proceedings, and I think that the California Supreme

25

Court rendered a decision which assumes that the

17

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

contract does not provide for such arbitration.
The thrust of its decision is that regardless

3 of whether the parties agree to it or not this can be
4 imposed on the parties.

6

Speaking very briefly about the merits of this

6 class action issue, our position is simply that the two
7 procedures, class actions and arbitrations, are
8 fundamentally incompatible with one another.

The whole

9 idea of arbitration is to establish a procedure which is
10 simple and quick and inexpensive and informal and most
11

of all nonjudicial whereas class actions by their very

12

nature as well as by due process considerations are

13 necessarily very formalized in their procedures,

very

14 time consuming, very expensive and most of all highly
15
16

regulated by the courts.
If a court did not actively supervise every

17 stage of this proceeding and guarantee that the named
18

represenative is adequately represented the class, if

19

the court did not ensure that the evidence being

20

presented in trial were truly common to all class

21

members the results of that arbitration would not be

22

binding on absent class members.

23

create a hybrid of the two procedures you would have to

So if a court tries to

24 have a court looking over the arbitrator’s shoulders
25

every step of the way and you would be creating endless

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

opportunities for one part or the other to go running

2

back, to court asking a judge to second-guess what the

3

arbitrator has done.

4

We think that this Court has to make a

5 choice.
6

You can either tell parties —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Schooner, why under California

7 procedure would the California courts not be free to say
8 the arbitrator can conduct a class proceeding as he
9

wants to.

We will only check it out when you bring an

10

action to enforce the arbitration award so that you

11

would not have any interim supervision of the

12 arbitration at all.
13

MR. SPCONERs

Your Honor, I think the reason

14

for that is that you cannot — ft judge unless he is

15

involved in a class action case and if he is just

16 looking at it after the fact he is not in a position to
17
18
19

know what kind of job the class represents.
QUESTIONS

That may make good sense as a

matter of legal observation, but can you tell from the

20 opinion of the Supreme Court of California that they
21
22

adopted your proposition?
MR. SPOONERs

The Court specifically said that

23

in addition to the class certification proceedings the

24

Court would have to exercise a measure of control over

25 the arbitration itself in order to ensure that the

1

interests of the class were being adequately represented

2 as well as to approve any settlements or dismissals.
They did not define what that measure of

3
4

supervision and control would be, but our position is

5 that it would necessarily be quite extensive and
6 regardless of whether it was extensive or not it would
7 be inconsistent with the idea that arbitration is

8 supposed to be a procedure apart from the court systems
9 taking

place outside of that forum.
QUESTION;

10

question?

Mr. Spooner, may I ask another

It really again relates a little bit to the

4

12 finality, but do we know that on remand if the issues
13 are a little more clearly defined than they seem to be
14 now, say, for example, that you get an arbitration of
15 whether there was adequate disclosure and presumably you
16

have got some form documents you give every franchisee.

17 Do we know it will be contrary to your client's interest
18 to have a single arbitration resolving that issue for
19 everybody who says you did not make an adequate
20 disclosure?
21

That seems to me it is not perfectly clear

22

that you would oppose the class.

23

MR. SPOONER;

QUESTION;

MR. SPOONER;

Honor,

arbitration is that when somebody raises a claim you can

because one of the primary attributes of

3 litigate it simply and informally.

If we had a

4

class-wise arbitration proceeding you would have two

5

things that would change the ballgame altogether.

6

7

First of all, we think that the procedures and
the complexities of such a procedure would be such that

8 the case would become more complicated than if it has
9

remained in court all along.

Secondly, there would be

10 severe questions about whether if Southland won in such
11

a procedure the results would be binding on absent class

13

Third, one of the attributes —

QUESTION:

Well,

they clearly will not be

You are foreclosing the opportunity to get a class-wide

HR. SPOONER:

QUESTION:

You say, for example, one of the

22 issues is whether the disclosure is adequate.

If you

give them some form book that says how you are going to

everybody the same book, and the arbitratory will look

25

MB. WELLS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I would like to begin discussing the problem
that Mr. Schooner discussed first, namely, the guestion

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

-

1

raise! by the claim that the Federal Arbitration Act

2 preempts any claims litigated under the franchise, that
3 is, preempts the anti-waiver clause in the California
4 franchise investment law.
5

But before addressing the

question of preemption there is a preliminary issue that

6 needs to be resolved and needs

7 Court,
8

to be addressed by this

and that is whether the arbitration clause in

question in fact and in law is broad enough to include

9 the claims under the California franchise invesment
10
11
12

law •
The preliminary question was decided in the
trial court in this case against arbitration.

He

13 concluded that the clause in question was not intended
14 to and did not reach claims under the statute.
15
16

The District Court of Appeals disagreed with
him, and reversed that part of his decision.

That

17 decision was set aside by the Supreme Court’s grant cf a
18 hearing so that decision was vacated.
19

The California Supreme Court expressly

20 declined to discuss that issue because it passed
21

straight to the preemption issue and held that the

22 franchise investment law claims are not arbitrable under
23

the anti-waiver clause in the franchise investment law,

24 a clause copied from the Federal Securities.
25

It

interpreted that clause in the same way that this Court

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

did in Wilko v. Swan and concluded that the California

2 legislature intended to provide a special judicial forum
3 for claims under that Act just as in the securities law
4 and then went on to conlude that the Federal Arbitration
5 Act was not inconsistent therewith because Congress had
6

announced or enacted similar policies to the franchise

7 investment law in securities cases and others.
8

QUESTIONS

Do you think that interferes with

9 the rights of individual parties tc pick their own forum

10 by contract?
11
12

MR. WELLSs

To the extent only that the

California Supreme Court — Excuse me.

The California

13 legislation as interpreted by the California Supreme
14

Court has decided that a certain class of citizens need

15

protection from their own waiver for arbitration

16 agreement because the statute provides that parties may
17 not waive their rights under this statute.

To that

18 extent, yes, parties are foreclose! from entering into
19

binding arbitration agreements as they might relate to

20 claims under the franchise investment law.
21
22

QUESTIONS

In a case strictly in the federal

courts, Berman v. Zepotowich neither of you cite, this

23 Court discussed that subject and came to the conclusion
24

that parties dealing at arms length could make binding

25 contracts for arbitration.

HR. WELLS*

That is right, of course.

That

is, of course, the thrust of the Federal Arbitration

3 Act.

It is the thurst of the California Arbitration

4 Act, and I think most states have similar statutes which
5 overrule the old common law rule that agreements to
6

arbitrate are not enforceable because they house the

7 courts of jurisdiction.
There is no question but what the policy of

8
9

the federal government as exemplified in the Federal

10

Arbitration Act and the policy of the government of the

11

State of California as exemplified by its arbitration

12

statute is that generally speaking agreements to

13 arbitrate future disputes are valid and enforceable
14 except on grounds that might invalidate contracts
15 generally.
16

Congress and the state legislature in fact the

17 legislatures I am told by the amicus briefs some 38
18 states have enacted legislation in the securities field
19

which the franchise investment law is very analogous to

20 which incude that same provison that persons who bring
21

claims under these remedial statutes are not obliged to

22 arbitrate those claims.

They are guaranteed their day

23 in court, a judicial forum.
24

That is the policy of the Congress, and that

25 is the policy of the state legislatures.

Sore than that

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 62*4900

1

the Congress has specifically encouraged the states to

2 pass parallel and concurrent securities regulations
3 sta tutes .

The Securities Act specifically provides for

4

5 concurrent jurisdiction on issues of securities

6 violations by the state and the federal government.

Of

7 coruse, the extent that Congress and the Securities

8 Exchange Commission have occupied the field, any
9 legislation to the contrary by a state would be
10

invalid.

11

But these state statutes are essentially the

12

same as the federal statutes in purpose and in effect,

13 and quite apart from encouraging forum shopping the
14 conclusion if the Supreme Court of California’s decision
15 is upheld, the decision that Southland is asking for is
16 the one that would encourage forum shopping because as I
17 understand their position it is that while Congress may
18 have a

policy and may include anti-waiver provisions in

19 its securities statute in order to protect the person
20

who is in the weaker bargaining position and ensure him

21

his day in court, the state legislatures who are

22

encouraged to pass these concurrent and overlapping

23

securities statutes are not entitled to pursue that same

24

policy .

25

That would result in the same claim that came

1

into the federal court being not arbitrable but if it

2 was brought in the state court under the state
3 securities law it would be required to be arbitrated.
4 Back to the question of the preliminary inquiry which I
5

think this Court must address before it reaches, shall

6 we say, the merits of the preemption claim.
The clause in question — The Supreme Court of

7

8 California specifically declined to rule on that issue,

but it is an issue that was in the case.

It was always

10 contended by us that this clause does not include claims
11

under the franchise investment law for this reason, and

12

I think it is a very valid reason.
The arbitrator has only the power that is

13

14 given him by the arbitration agreement.
15 court.

He is not a

He can only do what the parties have agreed that

16 he may do, and in this case although

the preamble

17 section or the introductory section of this clause says
18

that he may arbitrate all issues which arise out of or

1

relate to the agreement while you might say that is

20

broad enough to embrace claims under the franchise

21

investment law because they have a relationship to the

22 agreement it goes on and gives him the authority only to
23 award damages for breach of
24
25

the agreement.

There is nothing in the arbitration agreement
which gives him any authority to award damages for

27
AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 826-0300

1

misrepresentations leading up to the agreement that are

2 required by the franchise investment lav, and that is a
3 respect in which this arbitrator could not enforce the
4

5

provisions of the franchise investment law.
QUESTION*

You say the superior court found to

6 that effect?
7

HR. WEILS*

That is right.

The superior

8 court, the judge in superior court said, "I find that
0 this clause is not broad enough to include claims under
10 the franchise investment law."
11

He said, "I also think that if it did those

12 claims would not be arbitrable for the reasons that were
13 later adopted by the Supreme Court."

But he clearly

14 indicated as one of his grounds for that ruling that he
15 thought the agreement would

not reach claims under the

16 franchise investment law.
17

Furthermore, another clause in another part of

18 the arbitration clause provides that nothing herein
19 shall authorize the arbitrator to vary or modify or

20 supplement any of the terms of this contract.

Now that

21 flies in the face of the remedies under the franchise
22 investment law one of which is that if the disclosure
23 statement is misleading or false, the required

24 disclosure statement, the prefranchise disclosure
25 statement, the court may rescind.

One of the remedies

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

is rescision of the franchise agreement
That is a remedy that the arbitrator would not

2

3 be able to enforce.

So the result would be that the

4

Plaintiffs here would be giving up more than and they

5

would be waiving more than their right to a judicial

6

forum.

7

that have been given them by the legislature under this

They would be waiving substantive claims, rights

8 sta tute.
That, of course, is one of the reasons that

9
10

the federal courts including this Court have decided in

11

a line of cases that there are certain types of claims,

12

remedial statutes which were intended to protect persons

13 in a weaker bargaining position such as the securities
14

laws that those claims are not required to be artibrated

15

by the Federal Arbitration Act.

Cne of the reasons for

16 that is that arbitrators are peculiarly not well
17

suited.
Arbitration is not a good place to enforce

18
19

important rights set forward in a statute that is

20

complicated.

6

QUESTION*

You can waive a right to trial

Well, I know that the —
I can understand the arbitral

7 statements can do it, but I think you are saying that
8 they just cannot waive them

MR. WELLS;

9

at all.

According to the provision in the

10 Corporate Securities Act of the State of California as
11

interpreted by the California Supreme Court, one may not

12

waive the right to a judicial forum as a place tc make a

13 claim

under that statute.

That same clause was so

14 interpreted by this Court in Wilko v. Swan when that
15 clause was found in the Securities Act of
16

1933.

I thought that there was no issue left as to

17 whether that was not an appropriate decision that
18 parties may not waive by means of an arbitration
19 agreement executed prior to the event prior to the
20 dispute arising the right tc a judicial forum.
21

There is — Leaving the matter of the

22

preliminary inquiry as to the interpretation of the

23

arbitration clause and turning for a moment to the

24 question assuming for the sake of argument which we may
25 do that the arbitration clause did not reach these

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 028-8300

1

claims under the franchise investment law, now the

2

question becomes in light of the California Supreme

3

Court's decision that such claims are not arbitrable is

4

that somehow preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act?

5

That is a question really of whether there is a conflict

8 between the federal law and policy and the state law and
7

policy.
Our position on that is that there is no such

8
9 conflict.
10

Each has the same proarbitration policy as

represented by the Federal Arbitration Act.
The state courts are every bit as zealous in

11
12

protecting, that is the California courts at least, are

13

every bit as zealous in protecting the rights to

14 arbitrate under a pre-dispute arbitration agreements as
15

are the federal courts.

The behavior of the courts in

16

this case is a good example of that because we attacked

17 the arbitration agreement when it was asserted as a
18

basis for preventing or going forward with a class

19

action on grounds that Southland had waived their rights

20

under the statute and on evidence which was very strong

21

in some of these cases of waiver because Southland had

22 gone ahead and litigated the case in the courts and
23

taken depositions for weeks and months in certain of the

24

cases.

25

case that there was no waiver of the right to

The California courts nevertheless held in this

31

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

arbitrate.

2

When presented with the adhesion contract

3 argument in this case, the California court leaned over

4 backwards to protect the rights of the parties to
5 arbitrate.

Although finding that this arbitration

6 clause was in an adhesion contract,

the California

7 Supreme Court nevertheless refused to say that it was
8 invalid and unenforceable unless perhaps it would be so
9 if it had the effect of defeating the effect, the right
10 to a class remedy.
By the same token both jurisdictions, the

11

12 federal courts and the state courts, have the same
13 policy the same set of laws in the field of securities
14 regulation, franchise regulation and others that
15 recognize that in certain situations where you are
18 dealing with important statutory rights whether it be
17 under the securities laws, anti-trust laws. Fair Labor
18 Standards. Act, bankruptcy laws notwithstanding the
19 strong policy in favor of arbitration these are claims
20 that are not suited to arbitration.
21

Arbitration is not

appropriate, and it is not the federal policy under the

22 Federal Arbitration Act to require arbitration in those
23

24

cases.
So there is no conflict really between the

25 policy of the federal government and the policy of the

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) S2S-9300

1

state government# and nothing about the decision of the

2

California Supreme Court here is in any way inconsistent

3 with or in conflict with the policy of the federal
4

government.

If this case had come up under the Federal

5 Securities Act rather than the California franchise
6

investment law, that very same anti-waiver clause would

7 have been upheld by this Court under the doctrine of

8 Wilko v. Swan.
There is no reason —

I must confess I am not sure I thoroughly

15 California said

we really do not like arbitrations at

all but we understand we have a duty to honor contracts

17 under the federal statute but we do not have to honor
18 this one because of our own franchise invesment law?

If they had a statute that

4

QUESTIONS

Supposing they had a statute that

5 said we do not want to arbitrate anything more than the
6

federal government requires us to, and we do not think

That would be the same case we

their argument that their general policy is very similar

to the federal policy.

20 really do not like arbitration.
21

MR. WELLSs

I do not think that the California

22 courts’ policy with respect to arbitrating disputes that
23

are not in Congress would have anything to do with the

24 case so long as the claim before the court at that time
25 was a claim under the franchise investment law which is

3U

directly analogous to, in fact it derives from the

2 federal policy in the securities regulation field
3

because they copied the anti-waiver clause right from

4

that --

5
6

QUESTION*
a different way.

Well, let me put a similar question

Supposing they had ruled that

7 contracts of adhesion are something

we do not like in

8 California, therefore, we will never enforce an
9
10

arbitration clause in a contract of adhesion.
have argued something close to that.

11

UR. WELLS*

12

QUESTION*

13

That is right.
Could they have accepted that

argument consistently with the Federal Arbitration Act?
MR. WELLS*

14
15

I think

Yes, I think they could because

the Federal Arbitration Act says that all agreements to

16 arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable
17

save on grounds for the revocation of contracts

18 generally at law or in equity.

To us as we understand

19

that it means that if the ground for refusing to enforce

20

the arbitration agreement is a ground applicable to

21

contracts generally and as a part of a general contract

22

law then the Federal Arbitration Act does not reach

23

tha t.
It does not require that agreement to be

24
25

enforced.

So there are various situations under general

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

contract law, and I think the law of the State of

2 California would apply to that.

There is a whole area

3

here where if the Federal Arbitration Act is going to be

4

given the effect of federal law, substantive law but

5

recognizing that it includes many procedural aspects as

6 does the state statute then

there is going to be a

7 question do we apply the federal law to this particular
8 issue that goes to the arbitrability of the contract or
9 do we apply the state law.
10
11

Those are very nice questions.

I think it is

sufficient for this case to observe that the effect of

12 these federal decisions exempting certain types of
13

claims from the operation of the arbitration statute is

14 to define the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act.
15
16

The scope of that Act is to reach out and
require arbitration when people have agreed to arbitrate

17 most of the time but not always.

There is a certain

18 class of cases where it does not apply.
19

Those cases have been described by this Court

20 and the other federal courts from time to time.

They

21

are the bankruptcy cases and the anti-trust cases and

22

the securities regulation cases and the Fair Labor

23

Standards Act cases.

24
25

Those are a class of cases that the Federal
Arbitration Act does not apply to, and in our view the

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-03OO

1

only rational interpretation of the Federal Arbitration

2

Act when applied to state law claims is that if they are

3

in that same category of claims if they are directly

4 analogous to those claims that the Federal Arbitration
5

Act does not reach on the federal side the Federal

6

Arbitration Act should not then reach them on the state

7 side.

That is buttressed.

8
9

It seems to me it becomes

a kind of a fortiori case where you are dealing with the

10 very sensitive duality federal state problem here
11

because here you have a state legislature in the

12

exercise of its police power enacting a remedial statute

13

for the benefit of its citizens which will apply to some

14

extent in cases in interstate commerce.

That will be

15 necessarily the case becasue everything has some effect
16

on interstate commerce and in the course of doing sc

17 adopt a

policy which is identical to that of the

18 Congress.
19

In the area of selecting the forum for the

20 adjudication of state created rights as this Court has
21

recognized in the recent case of Northern Pipeline

22 against Harathon the power of Congress is very minimal.
23

It seems to us that if anything the Federal Arbitration

24

Act would reach not as far and would stop short.

Me are

25 dealing with state legislatures who have declared in

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

this particular situation our citizens are entitled to a

2 judicial forum where that was true on the federal side.

But in any case we have a case that is exactly

3
4

analogous to Wildo v. Swan and these other federal

5 cases .

Finally, there is the matter if I may now turn

6

7 to the other side of the case, that is, the set of
8

issues that come here under the common law claims

9 assuming now for the sake of argument again that some
10 claims are going to be arbitrated in this case whether
11

they be claims under the federal franchise investment

12

law or the common law claims.
Now the question that Southland raises is

13

14 since the arbitration agreement in question is covered
15 by the Federal Arbitration Act is this notion of the
16 California Supreme Court that there can be a class-wide
17 arbitration something that is so contrary to the very
18 nature of an arbitration as a method for dispute
19 resolution

that it must violate the Supremacy Clause of

20 the United

States Constitution since the Federal

21

Arbitration Act would preempt any state policy to the

22

con tra ry.

23

Now on that issue I have several things to say

24 about that, but the most important thing is that issue
25 does not belong here.

I do not believe that it raises

38

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

any significant federal question.
It was an issue that was never raised.

The

3 preemption argument on the issue of class-wide
4 arbitration was never raised by Southland in the trial
5 court or in the Supreme Court of the State of
6 California.
7
8

To be sure it was recognized by both sides
that the Federal Arbitration Act, at least the
substantive provisions thereof, would cover the question

10 of arbitrability, that is, that it applied to this
11

contract since it affected commerce.

Our position was

12

then and it is now and has always been that it really

13 does not make any difference on the substantive side
14 whether the Federal Arbitration Act or the state
16 Arbitration Act applied because we find no difference
18 between them.
17

He have found no case or statement of policy

18 interpreting the California Arbitration Act that is any
1

different from the statements and interpretations of

20

this or the other federal courts in interpreting the

21

Federal Arbitration Act.

It is very clear that state

22 courts apply their own procedures in enforcing the

23 Arbitration Act.
24
26

That was done in this case.

You lock to the

California Court of Civil Procedure to determine hew to

39
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-0300

1

go about filing a motion to compel arbitration or to

2 obtain a judgment on the basis of an arbitration award.
There are various things in both of these

3
4

statutes that are appropriate in the procedures of that

5

court.

Here in the state court you do not apply the

6 Rules of Federal Procedure nor if you are in the federal

7 court vica versa.

But the question of — So the only extent to

8

9 which Southland ever referred to or treated this as a
10 federal question in the California courts was to
11

recognize that the Federal Arbitration Act, and they

12 claimed

that on the issue of whether or not you could

13 have a class arbitration they represented to the
14 California courts that that was a question to be decided
15

under state law and that since there was no authority

16 for it

in the California Code of Civil Procedure that it

17 should not be done.
18

We responded to the same question by the

19 District Court of Appeals as to which law applied by
20

saying that it did not matter.

We could find no

21

difference between the two.

22

law would apply and argued by analogy that the Fderal

23

Rules of Civil Procedure would provide some guidance to

We assumed that California

24 the California courts in developing a class remedy just
25 as the California courts have looked to Rule 23 of idd

40

1

Federal Rules in developing the class remedy generally

2

in court actions.

3

So first and foremost it was never raised.

4 is not discussed.

It

The issue of preemption, the

5 contention that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts
6

this and prevents the Supreme Cout of the State of

7 California from remanding this case to the trial court

8 to consider the desirability of a hybrid kind of class
9

arbitration was never raised as a federal issue as a

10 constitutional questiod below

But even if it were not only is there no final

11
12

judgment there is not any judgment of any kind except

13 the remand to the trial court to consider the
14

alternative ways to deal with the fact that we have

15 conflicting policies that the California courts
16

recognize as important, the importance of preserving the

17 parties* rights to arbitration if they have agreed to
18

arbitrate and the importance of providing a class remedy

19

for persons in the position of these franchisees when

20 dealing with their franchisor, a large corporation like

21
22
23

Southland.
It is a kind of situation that is perfect for
the class remedy.

If there can be no class remedy then

24 one of two things will happen.
25

Either there will be a large number of

41

AL0ER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

individual arbitrations or as Southland hopes there will

2 be a handful of arbitrations because other people do not
3 know they have a claim.

But the class remedy — The

4 California Supreme Court said in that situation if the
5 effect of the arbitration clause is going to be to
6 defeat the class remedy then perhaps the arbitration
7 clause under general principles of contract law as we
8 understand them should be declared invalid because of
9 the principles applicable to adhesion contracts.
10
11

So it sent the entire thing back to the trial
court who had not considered any of these issues to

12 decide among the alternatives.

Shall there be

13 consolidation of arbitrations which is clearly
14 recognized by the federal rules and the California court
15 says would also be available under the California Code
16 of Civil Procedure?
17

Should there be a single arbitration or seme

18 class arbitration under court supervision?

That is a

19 possibility.
20
21

Possibly the arbitration clause should be
stricken or it should be voided because of the

22 principles applicable to adhesion contracts.

A hearing

23 will have to be held.
24

Evidence will have to be taken.

25 will have to consider what to do.

A trial judge

In that posture it

42

seems to me that it would not be vise for this Court to

2

try to deal with the constitutional claim that scmehcv

3 objectives or policies under the Federal Arbitration Act
4 have been interfered with and the preemption doctrine

5 should apply.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARX J. SPCCNER, ESQ.,

11

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

2

QUESTIONS

3

Mr. Spooner, before you begin

4 supposing that Southland in this case instead of dealing
5 with franchisees had been dealing with new employees and
6 had handed to each one when they came to work, an
7 agreement to arbitrate any claim of injury arising out
8

of cr in the course of their employment and then one of

9 them sustained an injury and went to the Industrial
20 Accident Commission in California and Southland pleaded
2

you have to arbitrate this and the California court said

22 no we just do not allow anything except Industrial
23

Accident Commission proceedings for industrial injury.

24 Do you

think the Federal Arbitration Act would require

25 arbitration to prevail there?

43

MR. SPOONER*

1

Well, the first question would

2 be whether that employment agreement involved interstate
3 commerce.

If it did not then the Federal Arbitration

4 Act —
5

QUESTION*

I would assume that it would apply.

6

MR. SPOONER;

The second question would be

7 whether a provision in Section 1 of the Federal
8 Arbitration Act would exempt this class of case from the
9 scope of the federal statute.
10 it shall not be applicable

Section 1 provides that

to the contracts of workers

11

engaged in seamen's contracts and other interstate

12

transactions.

13

The scope of that exemption for workers claims

14 has never been construed by this Court.

It might be

15 construed not to apply to that situation.
16

QUESTION;

Well, assume that was not exempt.

17

MR. SPOONER*

If it was not exempt and if the

18 contract satisfied the general doctrines of contract
19 formation, it was not forced upon them by undue means
20 then our position would be that the federal Act controls
21
22

and the agreement should be enforced.
The Plaintiffs argue here that there are

23 federal situations in which certain types of claims have
24 been held not to be appropriate for arbitration and they
25 try to suggest that there is some sort of a broad

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

exemption for statutory claims. That simply is not the

2 case.
3

This Court has held in only a very few

4 situations that particular federal claims are not suited
5 for arbitration, and it has done that only after
6 carefully analyzing congressional intent in the
7 particular statute involved.
8

Thank you. Your Honor.
