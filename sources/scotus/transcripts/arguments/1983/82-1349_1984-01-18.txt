ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. GELLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

11

The Federal Aviation Administration has teen

12

charged by Congress with the responsibility of promoting

13

safety of flight of civil aircraft.

14

its statutory mandat in two principal ways, one of which

16

is essentially legislative,

18

described as law enforcement.

17

The agency fulfills

the other of which can be

First, the FAA promulgates regulations

18

prescribing minimum safety standards governing the

19

design , material, construction and performance of civil

20

aircraft.

21

in Title VIX in the Code of Federal Regulations.

22

These standards take up more than 5C0 pages

The second, the FAA tries to police the

23

aircraft industry’s compliance with these safety

24

standards by reviewing design and performance data,

26

conducting tests and deciding whether to certify that

regulations.

an airplane that does net have a current airworthiness

4

5

Congress has made it unlawful to operate

These cases were brought under the Federal

6

Tort Claims Act on behalf of the owners and passengers

7

of two airplanes that crashed due to in-flight fires.

8

Respondents sought more than $100 million in damages

9

from the United States on the ground that the FAA was

10

negligent in carrying cut its statutory responsibilities

11

by certifying the airplanes that crashed even though

12

they allegedly did not comply with the Agency’s safety

13

sta nda rds.

14

The Ninth Circuit agreed with Respondents'

15

arguments.

16

that Congress could not.possibly have intended to expose

17

the United States to tort liability to members of the

18

general public for errors in carrying out its regulatory

19

responsibilities.

20

We have sought certiorari because we believe

Although the issues here are solely ones of

21

law, I think it would be useful to begin by briefly

22

describing the facts of these cases in order to shew

23

just how far reaching and unprecedented the Ninth

24

Circuit’s judgment in this case really is.

It was sold to an air taxi service known as

Air Wisconsin.

In 1965 Air Wisconsin contracted with

4

Aerodyne Engineering Corporation for the installation of

5

a gasoline fuel heater, and as required by FAA

6

regulations Aerodyne applied for what is called a

7

supplemental type certificate authorizing the

8

installation of the heater.
In 1966, the following year, the airplane was

9
10

sold by Air Wisconsin to Respondent Dowdle who owned

11

Catalina-Vegas Airlines, another air taxi service.

12

Between 1966 and the crash of that plane in 1968

13

Catalina-Vegas inspected its airplane on at least eight

14

occasions including two major yearly inspections of the

15

gasoline heater.
The District Court found that the crash

16
17

occurred because the gasoline line leading to the heater

18

was not adequately clamped to reduce vibration allegedly

19

in violation of the FAA safety standard prohibiting

20

"excessive vibration in fuel lines".

Me think the most serious error of the Court

of Appeals, certainly the one with the most damaging

unprecedented after the Court's decisions in Indian

Towing and Rayonier?
NR. GELLER;

10

I believe so, Justice Pehnquist.

11

I hope to discuss this, but there is, I think, a basic

distinction between the sorts of operational activities

that were involved in those cases and the regulatory

activities that are involved in this case.

It seems clear to us from the legislative

requirement that the United States can only be held

8

state law would be liable”.

Congress not only

9

This phrase appears not only in

10

which is the substantive liability provision of the

11

Federal Tort Claims Act, but the precise same phrase

12

appears in 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), which is the grant of

13

jurisdiction to the district courts to hear Tort Claims

14

Act cases.

15

in the Feres case, which is one of the first decisions

16

of this Court interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act,

17

but there the Court held that Congress did not intend tc

18

allow the government to be held liable for engaging in

19

activities that are not even remotely analogous to

20

activities that private parties undertake.

21

28 U.S.C 2674 ,

This Court recognized the same basic point

The actions cf a government agency in

enforcing safety legislation pursuant tc a program cf

activities are a form of law enforcement.

the things that the Ninth Circuit said.

16

the most damaging statements in the Ninth Circuit's

opinion prevades the rest of the opinion in terms of its

18

error was the statement that the Ninth Circuit made that

19

plainly incorrect.

22

I think one of

That is

There is nothing in the FAA statute, or

responsibilities are complying with the FAA safety

QUESTION:

6

Mr. Geller, there is nothing in the

7

opinions of the Court in Indian Towing and Rayonier and

8

Muniz to suggest that liability turned on direct

9

operational responsibility.

10

Is this something you are

just extrapolating from facts in those cases?
MR. GELLER:

11

Justice C'Connor, I believe there

12

is something in those cpinicns that support precisely

13

what I

14

350 U. S. at page 64 the Court begins its opinion by

15

saying, "The question here is one of liability for

16

negligence at what this Court has characterized the

17

operational level cf government activity."

18

am saying here.

For example, in Indian Tewing

Four pages later on page 68, the Court

19

repeats, "It is hard to think of any government activity

20

on the operational level or present concern which is

21

uniquely governmental in the sense that it has not at

22

one time or another been privately performed."

23

So the Court*s opinions in those cases dc

24

suggest that what the Court had in mind were operational

25

rather than regulatory activities.

QUESTION

Well,

tut the Court rejected the

2

government's argument of the government function defense

3

in those cases.

4

MR. GELLER;

In those cases. Justice O'Conner,

5

I think a different argument was made and

6

terms of — Those cases involve operational activities.

7

The government had suggested that in the universe of

8

operational activities there should be a distinction

9

made between governmental proprietary activities and

10
11

uniquely governmental activities.
What the Court said in that case is that when

12

we are dealing with operational activities everything

13

that the government does is governmental, and it is

14

foolish to distinguish between proprietary activities

15

and uniquely governmental activities.

16

involves a distinctly different sort of governmental

activity which is a regulatory activity.

MR. GELLERi

7

I think that all of these

8

distinctions are reconcilable. Justice Pehnguist,

9

because I do think there is a basic distinction between

10

operational activities, which were what was involved and

11

what the Court emphasized was involved in Indian Tewing

12

and in Rayonier, and. regulatory activities in terms of

13

the private person language that Congress twice put into

sorts of governmental activities that even he and the

other dissenters agreed could net be the basis of a

I will just read one

sentence from Justice Jackson’s opinion because I think

5

it highlights a distinction we are making here.
Justice Jackson said, "When an official exerts

7

governmental authority in a manner which legally birds

8

one or many he is acting in a way in which no private

9

person

could.

Such official should be controlled solely

20

by the statutory or administrative mandate and not by

2

the added threat of private damage suits."

22

Sc even the dissenters in Ealehite understood

23

this basic distinction between operational activities

24

that the government may engage in or private people may

25

engage in and the quintessentially governmental

the decision of the Ninth Circuit in terms of its

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
HR. GERRY4

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The Congres in the Federal Tort Claims Act

17

decided decades age that the government should and will

18

be liable if a private person in like circumstances

19

would likewise be liable.

20

limited to a finding of negligence, and legislative,

21

judicial and policy decisions are outside the gamut, but

22

in cverzealcus performance of their duties the lawyers

23

of the Justice Department try to turn back the clock to

24

the pre-Federal Tort Claims Act era when injured parties

25

would have to go to Congress in private bills as they

2

problems with the government.

3

In these cases, each cf them, there can be no

4

doubt thai there was negligence on the part of

5

government employees which attributed as a proximate

6

cause to the death of 128 people and the total loss cf

7

two aircraft.

it more concrete the Venezuela Airlines bought a DC-3

QUESTION;

Even if that was 20 or 25 years

ago .

3

HR. GERRY;

The actual facts are, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, at the time of the certification of the DC-3

5

the CAA did not conduct itself in the same fashion as it

6

did in

7

such liability would be remote.

1958 when it certified the 707.

Sc I think that

Between the time of the cert ification of the

8

9

DC-3 and the time of the certification cf the 707 the

10

government had continued to permeate the field and tc

11

take over the responsibilities that had previously teen

12

conducted by private manufacturers.

13

with the private manufacturers doing all of the

14

inspection, all of the decision as to whether or net an

15

aircraft should be released, and then went on to where

16

we presently are or were in 1958 where only after the

17

FAA had inspected each and every part cf the aircraft

18

could an aircraft be released to be used by the general

19

public .

20

This all started

So as a practical matter the answer to ycur

21

question would be no.

As a legal matter, if they

22

negligently had done the same in that case as they had

23

in this, I would think the answer would have to be yes

24

because the rule as I understand it in the federal ccurt

25

is that the liability attaches at the time of the impact

We are here asking this Court to affirm these

cases tc send a clear message tc the executive branch tc

accede to the wishes of Congress and to cease clogging

errors have been made at the operational level which

cause death, injury cr destruction of property not tc

MR. GERRY;

Were these aircraft subject tc

inspection in the countries to which the airline's
purchaser is attached?
MR. GERRY;

11

Yes,

they were, Your Honor.

I am

12

aware of a question asked of counsel for the government

13

as to whether cr not the inspections would have

14

occurred, and there is a finding of fact in the United

15

Scottish case that it is impossible, uneconomical,

10

unreasonable and unfeasible for an owner of an aircraft

17

inspected and certificated by the Federal Aviation

18

Administration to take down the entire aircraft and

19

inspect it completely.
That happens two times where the entire

20
21

aircraft or a subsequent installation is inspected.

22

When the aircraft is originally certificated then it is

23

totally inspected by the FAA and by the manufacturer

also.

Also the government is liable if it increases

It is

If the government does their job properly, the

than it would be otherwise.

that have interpreted that provision that support cur

statement.

4

it need not worry about the peculiar result in this case

5

because the Plaintiffs will always have to show

6

neglig ence.

The Respondents have assured this Court that

Let's be clear what that means.

7

There was no

8

proof in this case, nor could there be in any of these

9

cases that a particular FAA inspector went in, locked at

10

a particular aircraft and determined that it was all

11

right whereas the safety standards show it was not.
The proof in these cases as in this case in

12
13

particular was the following:

An inspection had to be

14

made according to the Ninth Circuit before a certificate

15

could be issued.

A certificate was issued.

Subsequently., it was determined that the plane

16
17

was not in compliance with some safety standards.

18

Therefore, the government had to be negligent in

19

conducting its inspection.

It is a res ipsa theory.

Now it falls down for a number of reasons, one

20

21

of which is that it is based on this fallacious

22

assumption that the government has some obligation under

23

the statute the do a head to toe inspection of every

24

airplane.

25

realize that that is simply not true under the statute

I think it is important that the Court

or regulations.
The FAA has never done anything mere than

2

conduct spot checks in particular cases, and it reserves

4

the right in any particular case to inspect any part of

5

the airplane.

6

the regulations to do so.

It has no obligation under the FAA Act or

There was also a gruding admission from ¥r.

7
8

Gerry that the manufacturers do in fact have a

9

nondelegable duty to make an inspection of every part of

10

their equipment to make sure that it is in compliance

11

with the safety regulations and that they can be sued.

12

In this case, fer example,

13

passengers did sue Varig and Boein.

Varig did sue Bceing.

7he

Aerodyne was sued.

This, I think, precisely shows the distinction

14
15

between these sorts of regulatory cases and the

16

operational cases that I was referring to earlier

17

because in the operational cases the United States is

18

the only possible defendant, and the Court referred to

19

this, for example, in Bayonier in pointing out why the

20

operational activities in that case were not immune from

21

suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, one of the

22

things that the Court said was that if the United

23

States, which performed these operations, could not be

24

sued,

25

the plaintiff could net sue anyone.
But in these regulatory cases there will

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

an operator, or an installer that will have failed tc

is a suit against the United States for damages because

the United States did not exercise its regulatory

Finally, while it may not be terribly
