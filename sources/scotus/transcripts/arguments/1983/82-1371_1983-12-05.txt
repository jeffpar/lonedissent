ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. PAUL MC GRATH, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MC GRATH:

Mr. Chief Justice and, may it

please the Court:
The District Court here imposed mandatory time

11

limits on the processing of Social Security disability

12

claims, Title II claims, in the State of Vermont.

13

order was based on a finding "that the Secretary had

14

violated the Social Security Act because, in the District

15

Court's view, disability claims were not being decided

16

quickly enough.

17

That

The statute in question, which is Section 205(b)

18

of the Social Security Act, requires that claimants be

19

given, and I quote, "reasonable notice and opportunity for

20

a hearing."

21

time limits nor does it refer to timeliness as a

22

requirement.

23

The statute does not contain any mandation of

The issue here then is what did Congress require

24

by this broad statutory mandate?

And, in turn, since the

25

Secretary, under Section 205(a), has full power to issue

1

rules, regulations, and procedures to carry out the Social

2

Security Act.

3

The further issue is whether the Secretary acted

4

arbitrarily and capriciously in not promlugating mandatory

5

time limits.

6

We urge that the critical point here is this:

7

Both congress and the Secretary looked long and hard at

8

whether mandatory time limits should be imposed.

9

concluded that mandatory time limits would tend to

Both

10

undermine the effective operation of the Social Security

11

disability system.
QUESTION:

12

I take it, Mr. McGrath, you

13

acknowledge that the Secretary has the power to issues

14

regulations imposing such effort.

15

MR. MC GRATH:

16

In that context, we urge that it was totally

Yes, we do, Justice Blackmun.

17

inappropriate for the District Court to overrule the

18

policy choice made by Congress and the Secretary.
The Social Security disability system is a very

19

20

complex management problem and there are three reasons for

21

this.

22

expanding.

23

claims last year.

One is that the number of claims has been rapidly
There were more than two million disability

24

The second thing is that many of these claims

25

present very difficult physical and mental and economic

1

issues, especially since many of the claimants themselves

2

are unable to present their claims effectively because of

3

their very situation.
And, third, and perhaps most troublesome as a

4
5

management matter, the statute gives the Secretary three

6

quite conflicting mandates.

7

are eligible as quickly as possible.
But, secondly, given the dollars involved in the

8
9
10

One is to pay claimants who

program, it is equally important that claimants not
entitled to benefits not be paid.
And, finally, the Secretary is under an

11
12

obligation to conduct the program as fairly and accurately

13

and uniformly as possible.

14

Over the last ten years, Congress and the

15

Secretary have wrestled with how best to manage the

16

program given these conflicting concerns.

17

has considered on a number of occasions the imposition of

18

mandatory time limits and each has decided against such

19

imposition, even though they recognized that that would

20

undoubtely result in faster decisions in many cases, they

21

also recognized that it almost certainly would result in

22

many more wrong ones.

Each of them

First, I would like to focus on what Congress

23
24

did.

For one thing, Congress, on a number of occasions,

25

has amended the Social Security Act in a manner that is
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

inconsistent with any intent to impose mandatory time

2

limits, and I want to mention just two instances.

3

One is that when it established the Supplemental

4

Security Income program, the SSI program, which is part of

S

the Social Security system, it had put into the statute

6

the same reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing

7

requirement.

8
9

In addition, however, in that case, it put in a
90-day requirement for ALJ hearings, but most

10

interestingly, it exempted from that requirement

11

disability cases.

12

It is our position that the inclusion of a

13

90-day requirement as to the SSI program, but the

14

exemption from that of disability claims is clear

15

indication that when Congress intended to impose time

16

limits, it knew how to do so and did do so —

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Mr. McGrath, in that connection did

Congress do something about interim payments?
MR. MC GRATH:

It has done something about

20

interim payments in connection with the Title II program.

21

Several years ago it imposed interim payments where a

22

claimant's disability payments are being discontinued.

23

imposed such interim payments at the reconsideration stage

24

and it is our position that Congress' imposition of

25

interim benefits for that narrow class of disability

It

1

claims, Title II claims, is a further indication that

2

Congress did not intend the broad kind of interim relief

3

imposed by the District Court.
QUESTION:

4
5

What is the present status

legislatively of that interim program?
MR. MC GRATH:

6

That interim program actually

7

expires, I believe, at the end of this month, but starting

8

next year some new rules apply at the reconsideration

9

stage including hearings, de novo type hearings that were

10

not required prior to this time.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. McGrath, if the Court of Appeals

12

in this case had granted relief only to the individual

13

Plaintiff, Mr. Day, would you be here?
MR. MC GRATH:

14

We would probably not be here in

15

this sense, Justice O'Connor, that this case may not have

16

been cert worthy and we may not have petitioned for cert.

17

But —
QUESTION:

18

Would the Court have had the power

19

and authority in your view to order relief for an

20

individual plaintiff in the nature of saying you have to

21

complete your work within "X" number of days and,

22

furthermore, you can have interim relief?
MR. MC GRATH:

23

We believe not on the facts of

24

this case.

It is possible that you could have an extreme

25

case where a claimant could prove that the Social Security
7

1

Administrator had simply put that case on the back burner,

2

refused to act on it, and mandamus might be appropriate.
QUESTION:

3

Well, do you agree that Section

4

405(b) gives a claimant a right to a hearing within a

5

reasonable time?
MR. MC GRATH:

6

No, Justice O'Connor, not in so

7

many terms.

8

obligation to run the program as expeditiously as

9

possible, but that that obligation also — That overlaying

10

We believe that the Secretary has a broad

that operation —
QUESTION:

11

Well, does it impose an obligation of

12

any kind on the Secretary to grant an administrative law

13

judge hearing within a reasonable time?
MR. MC GRATH:

14

It does on an overall basis.

15

Secretary is required, we believe and we concede, on an

16

overall basis to try to conduct hearings as rapidly as

17

possible.

The problem is, as Congress —

findings of fact.
MR. MC GRATH:

Well, if you look at the District

23

Court findings of fact on — Let's take administrative law

24

judge claims, hearings, all the Court found was that in

25

approximately 47 percent cases were not decided within 90

1

days.
QUESTION:

2

I thought it also found that in

3

Vermont there were enough administrative law judges to go

4

around and the case load was pretty small and, therefore,

5

it was easily handled within a 90-day interval,

6

particularly because the errors that it found were simply

7

errors of judgment, if you will.

8

MR. MC GRATH:

9

not rely on any errors.

10

At the ALJ stage, the Court did
It just relied on the percentage

of cases that took more than 90 days.

11

And, the problem is, as Congress has noted over

12

and over again, many cases simply take a longer period of

13

time to develop the facts.

14

claimant has not really been able to make out a claim, but

15

as Justice Brennan noted last year in the Campbell

16

decision, the agency still has an obligation to try to

That is the

hearing — in the congressional report that accompanied

one of the bills that eventually was enacted in '82, in

many cases, take a longer period of time.

problem with mandatory time limits is that they, by their

very nature, are arbitrary and do not permit the

additional work in cases where that work needs to be done.

and that may not be apparent until before the hearing.

2

What the Court did is that Court said, well,

3

yes, if it has been the fault of the claimant, then the

4

90-day period does not bar the Secretary.

5

with that is there are a whole host of other factors that

6

could cause a delay and the Court did not take those into

7

account.
QUESTION:

8
9

The problem

Mr. McGrath, is the hearing de novo

at the administrative law judge stage?

10

MR. MC GRATH:

11

QUESTION:

12

hearing the claimant has had?

And, that is the second de novo

MR. MC GRATH:

13

Yes, it is.

Well, the hearing at the — What

14

happens at the state level stage is not as full — Is not

15

as full an evidentiary hearing as it is at the ALJ stage.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

It is characterized as a de novo

hearing.
MR. MC GRATH:

It is characterized as a de novo

19

hearing because of the fact that it is a de novo review of

20

the state's original finding, yes.

21

QUESTION:

Has Congress ever considered whether

22

it is really necessary to have, first of all, that many

23

hearings and, secondly, two de novo hearings?

24
25

MR. MC GRATH:

Well, Congress has considered

that on a number of occasions and, indeed, as I indicated
11

ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

in response to an earlier question, has actually required

2

a new, so-called face-to-face hearing at the

3

reconsideration stage, particularly in the case of

4

claimants whose disability benefits are being withdrawn.

5

And, I believe the theory was that as to those cases there

6

is a particular concern that the case be made out as best

7

as it can at an early stage so that a claimant can be kept

8

on the disability system where he or she has come to rely

9

on the Social Security.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

What is the average case load of the

administrative law judges?
MR. MC GRATH:

The average case load of the

13

administrative law judges is over 200 cases per

14

administrative law judge.

15

increasing over the last ten years.

16

of requested hearings has gone from about 70,000 in 1974

17

to about 350,000 this year.

18

That average case load has been
In fact, the number

But, during that period of time, the Secretary

19

has about doubled the number of administrative law judges

20

from about 400 to about 800.

21

I think it is interesting that there are less

22

than 500 sitting federal district court judges in this

23

country today.

24

administrative law judges coping with this load of cases.

25

There are almost twice as many

QUESTION:

Is there an overload in Vermont?

MR. MC GRATH:

2

QUESTION:

The situation in —

I mean, does the average law judge in

3

Vermont have 200 cases?

4

MR. MC GRATH:

The average caseloads are roughly

5

comparable from state to state and from region to region.

6

We have lodged with the Court the workload statistics of

7

the Secretary.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, let's put it another way.

You

characterize the 90-day rule as being arbitrary, right?

10

MR. MC GRATH:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

How do you characterize the present

12

rule which, as I understand it, allows the law judge to

13

take the rest of his life on a case.

14

MR. MC GRATH:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, the —

How would you characterize that as to

whether it is arbitrary or not?
MR. MC GRATH:

17

Justice Marshall, I would not

characterize the present situation as arbitrary for this

19

reason.

years in the face of the tremendous increase in claims is

21

to do a number of things which has resulted in a much more

22

efficient system.

QUESTION:

But, if you —

I am not going to ask you what you

would consider.

19

MR. MC GRATH:

20

QUESTION:

I think the significant thing —

May I ask you a question about the

21

government's theory, because I must confess I think — I

22

tend to confuse two issues as I read — The first issue is

23

whether the statute was violated.

24

there was a violation, was the remedy appropriate?

25

doesn't seem to me we reach the second question, we even

5

What is your position on whether the statue

MR. MC GRATH:

Our position is that the statute

was not violated.

6

QUESTION:

7

mandatory time limits, do we?

8

Then we don't have to talk about

MR. MC GRATH:

But, the problem is that in

9

looking at whether the statute was violated, you can't

10

really separate that from what the Secretary was doing.

11

And, in our view, what the Secretary was doing was

12

appropriate because the Secretary has broad discretion

13

under this statute to decide how to manage it and

14

obviously whether to impose mandatory time limits —

15

QUESTION:

And, what you are saying — I guess

16

your position then is even if it takes 200 or 250 days to

17

dispose of a case, that is not a statutory violation.

18

Judges are busy.

19

We take a long time some times.

MR. MC GRATH:

No.

What we would say is this.

20

It may be that in an individual case, an individual

21

claimant, because of the way he or she was treated by the

22

agency, might be able to make out a claim that his or her

23

rights were violated under the statute.

24

QUESTION:

But, none of these plaintiffs did.

25

MR. MC GRATH:

What happened here was the

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. MC GRATH:

By the time the District Court

4

issued the order here, the claims of the individual

5

plaintiffs had been taken care of.

6

this case is that it was a class-wide order in which the

7

judge made a decision based on the whole operation of the

statute in Vermont.

evidence was needed, no additional vocational evidence was

14

needed, and there was no excuse.

15

That wasn't what the District Court did.

What

16

the District Court did was to look at the length of time

that ALJ hearings were taking, found that in roughly 40

some percent of the cases they were taking more than 90

days and from that fact alone issued relief.

entries type information about 70 some odd cases,

22

concluded that the docket entries did not explain why

23

there were periods of time between different events and

24

also noted that roughly 40 percent of cases took more than

90 days and concluded from those facts alone that the

those 40 percent there is no statutory violation.

the clear —

the case was moot or raised mootness issues, the courts

19

have held the case is not moot for this reason.

QUESTION:

Going back to the situation of what

6

remedy the Court could impose in a class action situation,

7

if it determined on the basis of the facts that the delays

8

were unreasonable, in the Sixth Circuit, I think it was,

9

the Court there, as a matter of relief, said, well, we

10

won't impose arbitrary timeliness, we will just order that

11

the Secretary develop some reasonable time limits to take

12

care of these cases and the government opposed that as

13

well, is that right?

14

MR. MC GRATH:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MC GRATH:

The government did oppose that.

Now why?
That was the Blankenship case.

17

At the same time as the Court there ordered that the

18

government impose mandatory time limits in regulations,

19

virtually the same month, Congress, by statute, required

20

the Secretary to submit a report as to what time limits

21

might be appropriate and ordered the Secretary to take

22

into account such considerations as timeliness on the one

23

hand and the need to consider claims thoroughly on the

24

other hand.

25

considering what to submit to Congress, was considering

The Secretary, at the same time as he was

1

what to do in the Blankenship case, the Sixth Circuit

2

case.

3

The Secretary concluded in both instances to

4

urge that time limits were not appropriate, because after

5

the extensive rule-making process that had concluded, the

6

Secretary concluded that the imposition of mandatory time

7

limits would be inconsistent with the effective operation

8

of the statute, submitted that report to Congress.

9

Congress, in 1982, did not adopted mandatory

10

time limits.

11

reports that accompanied other legislation which Congress

12

did adopt that Congress concluded that mandatory time

13

limits would be inappropriate because — And the main

14

thing they emphasized is that individual cases may vary

15

greatly and that in many cases you do need additional

16

information and mandatory time limits are arbitrary in the

17

sense that the tend to ignore that consideration.

18

Instead, it is clear from the committee

The congressional reports also indicated, and

19

this, I think, is perhaps even more important, that

20

mandatory time limits can result in more incorrect

21

determinations.

22

determinations is not just that people will be paid that

23

shouldn't be paid.

severe problem, because in these cases many of the

claimants really are not capable of effectively presenting

2

their claims.

4

them to establish their claim.

5

the claim is denied.

6

Most of them, the vast bulk of them, are

And, if they can't do it,

If an arbitrary time limit is imposed and at

7

that point the Secretary has to act, the claim will get

8

denied and then the problem is they have to go to court

9

and even though they may get a reversal in court, the

10

statistics show that the federal courts today are taking

11

two to three times as long as the Secretary is at the ALJ

12

stage to hear these cases.

13

So that imposing mandatory time limits — I

14

think the biggest problem with the District Court's order

15

is that it may, in fact, result in many claims being

18

denied that should have been granted and then many of

17

those claimants going to court and even if they win in

18

court, it will have taken a much longer time for them to

19

receive benefits.

22

QUESTION:

So, you would just leave this whole

question to mandamus?
MR. MC GRATH:

I would say leave it to mandamus

23

in individual cases because here both Congress and the

24

Secretary have looked at this question so carefully.

25

many administrative improvements have been made under the

There are serious problems with the kind of

2

order issued by the District Court and since, under those

3

circumstances, I do not believe it could be held that the

4

Secretary's decision not to impose mandatory time limits

5

was arbitrary.
Since the Secretary has such broad statutory

6

responsibilities under the statute, we urge that the order

8

of the District Court should be reversed and the case

9

dismissed.
QUESTION:

10

Can you think of other examples where

11

we may have held that class action relief simply isn't

12

possible and that we have to order individual claimants to

13

resort to mandamus?

14

MR. MC GRATH:

15

QUESTION:

I cannot —

Because the Court has no inherent

power or it would be an abuse of discretion to grant any

class action.
MR. MC GRATH:

I do not offhand know of another

situation.
We are not saying here that there would be no

conceivable factual situation here in which a class-wide

order would have been appropriate.

23

here is that given the history, the close congressional

consideration, the careful scrutiny by the Secretary, and

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Munzing?

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. MUNZING

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9
10

MR. MUNZING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the record and results of this case show,

11

entrenched, unnecessary delays do not need to be apart of

12

the disability insurance appeal system.

13

The District Court, as affirmed by the Court of

14

Appeals in this case, engaged in the most basic of

15

judicial functions.

16

As counsel for the Secretary admitted, the Court
/

17

viewed the facts of the case and determined that

18

disability insurance claimants in Vermont were routinely

19

being deprived of the right to reasonably expeditious

20

administrative appellate action that the Secretary is

21

mandated to provide, together with other statutory goals,

22

by 205(b) of the Social Security Act.

23

As a consequence, the District Court, pursuant

24

to its traditional, flexible, remedial, equitable powers

25

fashioned a balanced, meaningful remedy that compelled
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

expeditious processing that was within the Secretary's

2

capacity, that did not cause extra cost to the Secretary,

3

and that did not harm other statutory goals such as

4

quality and accuracy in decision making.

5

QUESTION:

How significant do you think it is,

6

Mr. Munzing, that Congress addressed this problem on a

7

number of occasions and decided that arbitrary time limits

8

were not feasible?

9

MR. MUNZING:

Your Honor, I think that in

10

virtually every instance where Congress has amended the

11

Social Security Act in recent years in the disability

12

programs, in SSI and in disability insurance, vitually the

13

primary factor prompting Congress' interest has been the

14

problem of lengthy, unnecessary delay.

15

action Congress has taken has been, at least in part, in

16

the hopes of getting the Secretary to be able to deal with

17

and eliminate this problem.

18

Virtually every

Indeed, on many occasions, the Secretary has

19

represented to Congress that the disability delay problem

20

is well in hand and would shortly be resolved.

21

So, I hardly think we can say that either

22

Congress has not been interested in curing the delay

23

problem or that Congress has been made fully aware that

24

the Secretary does not have the capacity alone to deal

25

with the problem.

QUESTION:

1

But, the one remedy that Congress

2

didn't impose in the disability field was a flat time

3

limit.
MR. MUNZING:

4

We don't dispute that, Justice

5

Rehnquist, but what the Court did here, in the absence of

6

fixed time limits, but with the mandate to provide

7

hearings within a reasonable time, was to engage in a

8

fact-specific analysis of the circumstances it found in

9

Vermont.

10

As this Court noted in Fusari v. Steinberg, the

11

Connecticut unemployment delay case from 1975, any

12

statutory requirement embodying notions of timeliness,

13

accuracy, and administrative feasibility will inevitably

14

generate fact specific applications.

15

QUESTION:

Well, supposing, in fact, the system

16

of processing disabilities is running pretty much the same

17

all through the country; that the delays in Vermont are

18

no different than anywhere else, then I suppose the people

19

who go to court in Vermont and perhaps people who go to

20

court in Oregon are going to get this kind of relief, but

21

people who don't go to court in other states are going to

22

be left off the band wagon.

l

23

MR. MUNZING:

Well, that is where the fact-

24

specific analysis, the analysis of the factual record

25

developed before it by the District Court lead the Court

to find that there were differences in Vermont from

2

elsewhere.

3

record by the Secretary to show that the causes of delays

4

elsewhere or the circumstances of delays elsewhere — What

5

the Court found in Vermont, first of all, was that the

6

Secretary, since January of 1978, had a goal of processing

7

all cases within 90 days.

8

this case was even filed.

9

And, indeed, there was nothing put into the

That was almost a year before

The record also showed the District Court that

10

since 1977 the Secretary was processing SSI cases and

11

Title II cases, or it was supposed to be processing them

12

within this 90-day goal.

13

In other words, the Secretary herself provided

14

the District Court in Vermont with an objective criterion

15

against which the plaintiffs' allegations of unreasonable

16

delay could be measured.

17

QUESTION:

But, the fact that the Secretary set

18

the goals that are not, in fact, conformed to by the ALJs

19

doesn't make that kind of objective factor, at least so

20

far as I can see, automatically translate into mandatory

21

time limits.

22

MR. MUNZING:

But, it wasn't just the fact that

23

the Secretary, through these goals, supplied the Court

24

with this objective criterion against which to measure

25

unreasonableness.

The Court also found in the factual

complying with them in nearly one out of every two cases.

percent of them turned out to have been disabled all

along.

Really the Court found the

an arbitrary or kind of willful failure to comply, was it?
MR. MUNZING:

No, I don't believe so.

But, the

12

interesting thing is that with the impetus of the Court's

13

remedial order the Secretary discovered a capacity to

14

achieve the goals that previously she had articulated but

15

had not been able to achieve without having to move

16

additional resources into Vermont from elsewhere, without

17

harm to claimants elsewhere, without harm to other

statutory goals by fashioning a flexible, balanced,

effective, injunctive remedy.

There

Again, from the factual record, the District

3
4

Court learned that the Secretary's major concern at the

5

reconsideration level was that her disability

6

determination people would have sufficient time to be able

7

to develop enough medical evidence to do accurate

8

decisions.
At the hearing level, the Secretary's major

9
10

concern, as articulated to the District Court, was that

11

ALJs would have sufficient time to be able to deliberate

12

to ensure accurate decisions and, if necessary, to

13

schedule new consultative examinations if the ALJ

14

perceived that new evidence needed to be generated.
The District Court order excepted both of those

15
16

circumstances from the time frames, thus responding

17

directly to the Secretary's concern that time limits might

18

have some adverse impact on the quality of decision

making.

MR. MUNZING:

The Court's preliminary injunction

as to the hearing phase delays issued in December of 1980

QUESTION:

though is that the first five bites of the apple he had

It is our position that these kinds of facts,

MR. MUNZING:

It dosn't have to be, but in this

case it was and the test for whether a District Court's

7

injunctive discretion, equitable discretion, should be

8

limited is whether there exists a valid legislative

command.

We submit that there is no valid legislative

10

command that precludes courts from protecting claimants in

11

implementing the timeliness provision inherent in Section

12

205(b) of the Act.

13

Absent such a command, the test for this Court

on Review should be whether the District Court abused its

discretion.

balanced all of the Secretary's concerns against the needs

of the claimants that this remedial statute is designed to

report from the Secretary's own quality assurance review

was that it took the impetus of a judicial order to enable

QUESTION:

6

I see the Court of Appeals says that

7

Congress must have been aware of these cases, and when

they turned down specific time limits, they were aware of

these cases.

And, hence, Congress is going to leave it to

the Courts.
MR. MUNZING:

11

That is our position, Your Honor.

12

Congress was, in fact, aware of the time limitations that

13

certian courts had imposed and took no action to repudiate

14

them.

15

saying that courts could not do that.

16

There was no clear and valid legislative command

must have thought that these cases represented and

In the first place, the interim payments, which

7

we submit are not benefits but merely another aspect of

8

the court's flexible equitable powers, ensure compliance.

9

They are a yardstick to measure compliance.

They give the

20

MR. MC GRATH:

It is another question except

21

that I think the congressional record answers that

22

question also, Justice White, because Congress over and

23

over again said in their reports, things like the report

24

we quoted at pages 29 to 30 of our brief which was that

25

they were very concerned that mandatory time limits would

5

the ability to impose mandatory time limits.

6

MR. MC GRATH:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Yes, Justice Blackmun.

How does that tie in with your

statement just now that Congress was otherwise inclined?
MR. MC GRATH:

The Congress was very concerned

10

about mandatory time limits and I think that indicates

11

what Congress meant by the reasonableness requirement

12

under the statute and whether a court could read into the

13

statute more of a requirement of expedition than Congress

14

intended to put there.

15

the Secretary, in her discretion, could not conclude that

16

time limits of some sort were appropriate, perhaps

17

different time limits for different parts of the country.

18

The Secretary, however, independently, operating under the

19

authority in Section 205(a) of the statute, concluded that

20

such time limits were not appropriate.

21

That is not to say, however, that

just one question?

are reviewing?
MR. MC GRATH:

6

Absolutely.

The Secretary has

7

been able to comply with the time limits, probably would

8

be able to comply with any time limits, because all the

Secretary has to do at the reconsideration stage is make a

decision.
