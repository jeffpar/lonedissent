ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE M. JOYCE BARTEE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. BARTEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Fifteen years ago this Court decided the
landmark case of Terry versus Ohio.

It looked to the

10

language of the Fourth Amendment to articulate a promise

11

previously unrecognized; that is although all seizures

12

of persons, while withint he Fourth Amendment, not every

13

seizure requires probable cause to arrest to be reason­

14

able under the first clause of the Amendment.

15

Today we ask this Court to again focus its

16

attention upon the language of the Fourth Amendment

17

and recognize that it contains two separate, distinct,

18

and coequal clauses, 'the reasonableness clause and the

19

warrant clause, and to hold that administrative

20

inspection oriented searches fall without the warrant

21

and within the reasonsonabless clause.

22

More specifically, with regard to this case,

23

we are urging this Court to hold if there is a fire

24

and firefighters must enter the premises to distinguish

25

the fire, fire investigators may also enter the premises

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

within reasonable time after the flames have been ex­

2

tinguished to conduct an investigation of reasonable

3

scope and intensity to determine the cause and origin

4

of the fire.

5

We contend this initial unconsented, unwarranted

6

investigative intrusion, with or without probably cause,

7

is justified by the mere fact that a fire has occurred.

8
9

The bare language of the Fourth Amendment
requires only that searches and seizures be reasonable

10

and that if and when a warrant shall issue it must be

11

based upon probable cause to believe seizable items

12

will be found in the premises, supported by a sworn

13

affidavit and particularly describing the place to be

14

searched and the items to be seized.

15

Two views have emerged from this Court regard­

16

ing the Fourth Amendment requirements.

17

view to date holds that a search warrant is always required

18

except when the facts and circumstances fit within a

19

few carefully defined exceptions.

20

upon whether the failure to obtain a warrant is reasonable.

21

The prevailing

This view focuses

The second view recognizes that this Court,

22

starting with Camara, has forced administrative searches

23

unnaturally into the warrant clause and that this causes

24

serious problems.

25

indiscriminately to all searches, rather than simply

In applying the warrant preference

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

applying them to the seizure-oriented searches as

2

intended, this Court has been forced to distort the

3

concept of probable cause.

4

It is our contention, as is maintained by

5

the second view, that the Fourth Amendment guarantees

6

searches will not be unreasonable and that neither the

7

absence of a warrant nor the practicability of not

8

obtaining a warrant is dispositive of whether the Fourth

9

Amendment has been violated.

10

QUESTION:

Mrs. Bartee, I suppose you could

11

also prevail if the Court were to say that the facts

12

of this case fitted within the exigent circumstances

13

exception to the warrant requirement, could you not?

14

MRS. BARTEE:

The precise holding by this

15

Court in Michigan v:.~:Tyler dealt withla subse.-

16

quent entry which was made after initial entry was made

17

while the flames were smoldering.

18

before this Court nows deals with an initial entry which

19

was made six hours after the flames had been distinguished.

20

QUESTION:

The precise issue

Unless, Mrs. Bartee, the entry

21

of the investigating arson squad is part and parcel

22

of the initial entry of the firefighters.

23

connection, I would like to know whether, in the juris­

24

diction in question, the arson squad would have visited

25

the Cliffords' home even without a report that the fire

In that

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

was of suspicious origin.

2

they always go?
MRS. BARTEE:

3

Is it a routine thing?

Do

Fire investigators investigate

4

approximately 130 to 160 fires a day.

Well, I am sorry,

5

there are approximately 130 to 160 fires a day.

6

investigate approximately 20 of them and they do that

7

in a priority order which starts off — If there is

8

a major explosion or a homicide on the scene, they leave

9

wherever they are — If they are in the middle of an

They

10

investigation, they leave and go to that site.

11

then go down and determine what is priority from there

12

on.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

They

What determines whether the arson

squad would go to a fire scene?
MRS. BARTEE:

I think it is a matter — There

16

are many arsons which are never investigated.

17

upon the degree of damage.

18

case was determined to be a priority case because a

19

police officer was involved and they always investigate

20

a police officer's house if they possibly can.

21

22

QUESTION:

And, in this case — This

Do you mean because the owner of

the premises was a police officer?

23

MRS. BARTEE:

24

QUESTION:

25

It depends

That is correct.

I see.

So, what you are saying

to me is that the arson squad would have gone in any

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

even to this fire?

2

MRS. BARTEE:

3

QUESTION:

4

But, that might be suspected that

somebody is after a policeman.

5

6

That is correct.

MRS. BARTEE:

That is correct.

There are

several —

7

QUESTION:

So, there is always some thread

8

of suspicious circumstances present in the cases that

9

the arson squad investigates.

10

MRS. BARTEE:

Well, there may be.

Arson

11

investigators have several purposes which makes this

12

case a particularly tough case in that it is not purely

13

an administrative search.

14

QUESTION:

It may have —

I want to pursue Justice O'Connor's

15

question.

16

are the cases they do not investigate, those that have

17

no suspicious circumstances at all?

18

How do you — Let's put it this way.

MRS. BARTEE:

What

Those that have no suspicious

19

circumstances, those for which there is not a high like­

20

lihood of rekindling, those for which the cause and

21

origin is determined definitely, those that they can

22

get to.

23

Many times they just have to cut —
QUESTION:

What about the case where they

24

think it has been definitely determined that it is arson?

25

Won't the arson squad go and —

MRS. BARTEE:

What the firefighters do themselves

2

in the

3

mination without further investigation.

4

what we have in this case, a preliminary determination,

5

and they leave it to the fire investigators to follow

6

up that determination and find out for sure.

7

City of Detroit is they make a preliminary deter­

QUESTION:

And, that is

When the investigator arrived there,

8

there were still some of the post-arson, post-fire activity

9

going on, was there not?

10

MRS. BARTEE:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, there was.

They were still boarding up the

12

windows and pumping water out of the basesment and clean­

13

ing up debris?

14

MRS. BARTEE:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Following through on the other

16

questions, wasn't there a formal report to the arson

17

squad in this case?

18

MRS. BARTEE:

I believe there was some indication

19

of that in the record, but that was not accurate.

20

formal report is drawn up, but the fire investigators

21

do not receive that report until two or three days later

22

and that as the firefighters go back to their office,

23

compile a formal report and sent it over the fire

24

investigators when they are completed.

25

QUESTION:

A

Now, does the record show that?

1

MRS. BARTEE:

2

QUESTION:

3

MRS. BARTEE:

No, it does not.

How are we to accept it then?
I believe that the record indi­

4

cates — It does not indicate anything specifically.

5

It indicates both views.

6

was being cross-examined, he said, no, we do not receive

7

a written report, yet the compiled facts indicate a

8

written report and that was sort of a slip-up and which

9

I checked out the question myself, because I think it

While the fire investigator

10

does make a difference.

11

to some extent, depending on what this Court's holding

12

is, but it would be our contention, even if these fire

13

investigators entered the premises with probable cause

14

to believe that the cause and origin was arson, and

15

with probably cause to believe that seizable evidence

16

of arson could be found on the premises, that the fire

17

presents and independent justification aside from that

18

to enter those premises.

19

Well, it does make a difference

Let me give you an analogy just so we can see

20

that this would be correct.

21

inspector has probably cause to believe that "X" will

22

be crossing the border with a suitcase full of cocaine,

23

even though he has probable cause to believe seizable

24

evidence of a crime will be found in that suitcase,

25

and even though it may be practicable to obtain a warrant,

If, for example, a border

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

no warrant is required, because a border search, which

2

is made to portect the sovereignty of our country, requires

3

no cause of warrant.

4
5

QUESTION:

But, you can't extend a border

search to an arson investigation, can you?

6

MRS. BARTEE:

I would like to analogize the

7

border situation to the fire situation in that there

8

is no greater threat to the lives —

9
10

QUESTION:
to a border.

11
12

MRS. BARTEE:

The fire situation would be

limited to those instances where a fire occurs.

13
14

Well, the border one is limited

QUESTION:

Well, one is oranges and one is

apples or stones.

15

MRS. BARTEE:

My only analogy would go to

16

the extent that if probable cause does exist for the

17

border situation, the independent justification for

18

the search, which is the border search, requires no

19

warrant.

20

that a fire presents a situation which would allow the

21

fire investigators to enter and determine what was the

22

cause for this fire, then the fact that probable cause

23

exists cannot defeat that independent justification

24

for entering the premises.

25

Similarly, in a fire — If this Court accepts

QUESTION:

I take it from the position you

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

have suggested that if the men who were working to pump

2

out the excess water out of the basement found some

3

incriminating evidence, that that would be admissible

4

as part of the whole process of extinguishing the fire

5

and restoring safe conditions.

6

MRS. BARTEE:

The people that were on the

7

premises were not government officials, but I believe

8

if that was — Those were insurance people, I believe,

9

and if that evidence — Once that evidence was left

10

there in the basement, I believe that should be admis­

11

sible evidence as part of that first initial investigative

12

entry.

13

It is —

14

QUESTION:

May I ask you another question

15

as long as you are interrupted?

16

the fire, the firefighters as they put it out or as

17

they were pumping out the water, discovered in the base­

18

ment what appeared to be to them an illicit drug

19

laboratory.

20

hours later without a warrant to investigate that like

21

the arson squad did?

22

Suppose that after

Could the police then have entered six

MRS. BARTEE:

Absolutely not, because I think

23

what I would have to have is that the person who finds

24

this evidence is validly on the premises.

25

We are urging this Court to hold that a valid

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

purpose for entering those premises, once a fire has

2

occurred, would be to investigate the cause of an origin

3

of that fire and to prevent rekindling if it is possible,

4

or if a fire is rekindled, to put that rekindled fire

5

out and to assure that a dangerous and volitile situation

6

still does not exist.

7

QUESTION:

Mrs. Bartee, when you advance those

8

justification, does it really differ much, your theory,

9

from the question posed to you by Justice O'Connor that

10

it could come within the exigent circumstances, etc.

11

in Clifford?

12

MRS. BARTEE:

Well, we would urge this Court

13

to first reach the constitutional question and that

14

is does a fire investigation require a warrant?

15

this Court follows my analysis, as is urged, then this

16

Court would find a fire investigation falls within the

17

reasonableness clause and we would never reach the Tyler

18

question and it would never have to determine an exigency.

19

QUESTION:

If

But, you must realize you have

20

a fairly strong laboring ore to bear with the Court

21

having decided the Clifford case.

22

Now, your petition for certiorari was granted,

23

but that doesn't necessarily indicate, I think, that

24

the Court wants to have a brand new ball game in this

25

area after having decided Clifford.

12

1

QUESTION:

Tyler.

2

QUESTION:

I am sorry, Tyler.

3

MRS. BARTEE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MRS. BARTEE:

I believe that the Clifford —

I am sorry to have confused you.
I believe that the Tyler case —

6

I can understand Justice O'Connor's position, but I

7

believe that the Tyler case itself dealt with the initial

8

investigative entry by the investigators and I think

9

there has to be a distinction between the firefighters

10

entering, because I think no matter how you view that

11

entry, it has got to be justified.

12

comes with that initial investigative entry.

13

The tougher question

And, that initial investigative entry in Tyler

14

occurred while the flames were still smoldering.

15

Tyler precisely dealt with additional entries.

16

case, the initial investigative entry occurred six hours

17

after the flames were extinguished.

18

QUESTION:

19

MRS. BARTEE:

And,
In my

Which way does that cut?
Well, that cuts that this Court

20

would either have to modify Tyler or this Court would

21

have to go with the more prominent issue which would

22

be that the fire investigation falls within the reason­

23

ableness clause of the Fourth Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

And, hence — What would that do

to Tyler?

3

MRS. BARTEE:

It would cause this Court to

overrule Tyler.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, in addition to the

4

exigent circumstances possibility, we have never said

5

that every administrative search needs a warrant.

6

are certain kinds of administrative searches that fall

7

within a unique context and no warrant is required.

8

The investigators can just enter.

9

your position subsumes that I would think.

10

MRS. BARTEE:

There

And, I would suppose

Our position is that the present

11

day warrant exceptions are in actuality reasonable

12

searches under the reasonableness clause.

13

do not focus on seizure-oriented probable cause, such

14

as the heavily regulated business, search incident

15

arrest, inventory search, are reasonable in light of

16

the high governmental interest involved.

17

QUESTION:

Those which

Suppose your investigators that

18

you are saying were legally on the property, what if

19

they had found the illegal drug apparatus?

20
21

22
23
24
25

MRS. BARTEE:

I believe that would have been

in plain view.
QUESTION:

So that would have been seizable

because they were legally where they were?
MRS. BARTEE:

Because they validly invaded

that privacy interest already.

1

QUESTION:

But, they couldn't tell the police

2

and the police couldn't come in?

3

MRS. BARTEE:

4

QUESTION:

That is correct.

May I ask one question?

Your

5

exception that you seek, you want us to establish, is

6

for fire investigation.

7

mean by a fire investigation.

8

to determine the cause of the fire or is it an investi­

9

gation to determine whether there was arson?

10

MRS. BARTEE:

I am curious to know what you
Is it an investigation

A fire investigation is an

11

investigation to determine the cause and origin of the

12

fire.

13

purposes and one of the purposes might be the seizure

14

of criminal evidence.

But, as I have indicated, there may be multiple .

15

QUESTION:

16

MRS. BARTEE:

17
18
19

20

To prove arson?
If evidence of arson happens

to be on the premises, yes, that is correct.
QUESTION:

Or to put it another way, the Fourth

Amendment doesn't apply to arson.
MRS. BARTEE:

The Fourth Amendment would apply

21

to a fire inspection in the same manner which this Court

22

allows border inspections or seizure of the person and

23

this Court could set out demarcation of categories —

24
25

QUESTION:

Are you aware that there are statutes

on the border —

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

QUESTION:

Are you aware that there are federal

statutes involving border searches?

3

MRS. BARTEE:

4

QUESTION:

5

And you don't have a federal statute

involving state arson, do you?

6

MRS. BARTEE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MRS. BARTEE:

9
10
11

I believe that —

Correct.

Isn't that a difference?
There is a difference between

the two, but not to the extent that each one may present
an independent justification for entering the premises.
I believe that if this Court were to require

12

a neutral magistrate to determine that for a fire

13

investigator to go onto the premises to determine the

14

cause and origin of a fire, all that fire investigator

15

need say to that neutral magistrate would be there is

16

a fire on those premises and we don't know what the cause

17

and origin^ of that fire is.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mrs. Bartee, supposing that

19

Al Capone had lived in Detroit rather than Chicago and

20

the government had wanted to search his house for a

21

long while but could never find grounds for a warrant.

22

Then all of a sudden one day the police found out that

23

his house had burned.

24

call the Detroit arson squad and say, go over and search

25

Al Capone's house and see if you can't find some evidence

Now, do you think they could

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

of income tax violation?
MRS. BARTEE:

2

I believe that the purpose of

3

the fire itself would determine the appropriate scope

4

and intensity which would be they could not look in

5

desk drawers to determine the cause and origin of a

8

fire.

7

I am not here to —

8

QUESTION:

9

Is that what the inquiry is direct

at, to the cause and origin of a fire, and not to just

10

any sort of miscellaneous criminal conduct that the

11

person might have otherwise engaged in?

12

MRS. BARTEE:

I think the primary focus is

13

for the cause and origin of the fire and if a search

14

of inappropriate scope and intensity occurs, this court

15

has always recognized that that would be a reason to

16

exclude the evidence.

17

We believe, which may be helpful, that a

18

four-prong analysis should be undertaken whenever the

19

government contemplates invading a person's privacy.

20

First, the reasonableness clause would require

21

a balancing of the government's interest in achieving

22

the search against the individual's interest in privacy

23

to determine whether the type or class of search is

24

reasonable and permissible.

25

For example, a search of a private dwelling

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

for criminal evidence is a permissible class of search

2

once the balancing is applied.

3

A search of a private dwelling to see how

4

firearms are on the premises or to see what I can find

5

about a crime is not a permissible class of search and

6

may never take place.

7

The second question then, once we have a per­

8

missible class of search, would be is the sole purpose

9

of this search seizure oriented?

If the sole purpose

10

is not seizure oriented, then the third question simply

11

is what quantum of information is required to justify

12

this particular search.

13

For example, an administrative search might

14

be justified by a legislative scheme which authorizes

15

periodic inspections.

16

The fourth question then is, once the quantum

17

of information is met and once the search is deemed

18

permissible, the fourth question would be what safe­

19

guards does the reasonableness clause require in order

20

to insure that the execution of this search is reasonable.

21

Once again, in the administrative arena, the

22

reasonableness clause might require prior notice and

23

no inconvenient time of execution.

Now, if, on the other hand, the answer to the
second question is

that the search is — the sole

1

purpose of the search is to seize items, then the answer

2

to the third question, as to the quantum of information,

3

is always probable cause.

4

would still apply in that the search must be executed

5

in a reasonable manner.

And, the fourth question

6

This Court has recognized that a warranted

7

search which exceeds appropriate scope and intensity

8

is unreasonable.

9

ableness clause and that the reasonableness clause requires

And, I submit it violates the reason­

10

that all governmental intrusions be done in a reasonable

11

fashion.

12

It is our contention that Camara and its

13

progeny recognize that administrative searches are

14

justified, but felt compelled to apply the warrant

15

preference, and were, thus, presented with a dilemma

16

of defining the quantum of information necessary in

17

terms of probably cause in a situation where probable

18

cause was never intended to apply, and, thus, it resulted

19

in the distortion of the concept of probable cause and

20

the creation of a new type of warrant.

21

Those who advocate the primacy of the warrant

22

have delineated out two separate and distinct types

23

of warrants based upon the warrant language of the Fourth

24

Amendment.

25

First, the seizure-oriented warrant which

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

authorizes a government official to go on to designated

2

premises and seize evidence of a crime or property to

3

which the government has a superior claim of possession

4

must be based upon probably cause; that is facts and

5

circumstances which lead a reasonably prudent person

6

to believe that this seizable evidence of a crime or

7

or property to which the government has a superior claim

8

of possession will be found in the premises.

9

Secondly, the inspection-oriented warrant,

10

which is applicable in the administrative arena, authorizes

11

a government official to go on to designated premises

12

and inspect the condition of those premises and deter­

13

mine whether that condition violates a regulatory code.

14

This inspection-oriented warrant is necessarily based

15

upon something less than probable cause and may even

16

be based upon the legislative scheme with neutral

17

criterion.

18

It is our position that as stated by the

19

Fourth Amendment a warrant may not issue but upon

20

probably cause to believe that seizable items —

In all due deference, I believe

I do.

1

QUESTION:

You certainly do.

2

QUESTION:

The Court has changed its mind

3

on previous occasions, hasn't it?
MRS. BARTEE:

4

That is correct.

And, I believe

5

this Court changed its mind before Camara and See and

6

its progency came and that Frank versus Maryland existed.
And, I believe that the goals of this Court

7

8

would allow this Court once again to look at this

9

analysis and determine whether the Constitution does

10

require a warrant in the administrative arena.
QUESTION:

11

Mrs. Bartee, as a matter of curiosity,

12

I never know the Michigan practice, on page 83A of your

13

Joint Appendix is something called "Statement of Facts

14

and Proceedings."

Is that a stipulation?

MRS. BARTEE:

15

That was a stipulation in the

16

lower court, but I believe — And, that is where there

17

is the incorrect statement as to whether a written report

18

was received/was found.

19

Court is limited to that stipulation of facts as the

20

whole record is before it.
QUESTION:

21

22

25

Well, in other words, in Michigan

you call a stipulation a statement?
MRS. BARTEE:

23
24

However, I don't believe this

Statement of facts, that is

correct.
QUESTION:

And, I was going to ask you whether

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

we can accept the facts therein stated as true and correct

2

and I take it you are saying for the most part, but

3

not entirely so.

MRS. BARTEE:

6

Just a matter of curiosity, has

the insurance company ever paid off?

MRS. BARTEE:

MRS. BARTEE:

10

They are still calling me.

They are still what?
They are calling me to find

out the decision which this Court is going to hold.
QUESTION:

11
12

That is correct.

So, I take it your answer to me

is no.

13

MRS. BARTEE:

14

QUESTION:

That is correct.

May I ask a question about your

15

reasonableness theory?

16

to agree with something I had written that there ought

17

to be notice if they go in without a warrant and yet

18

there was no notice here.

19

if you didn't concede yourself out of court.

20

MRS. BARTEE:

As I read your brief, you seem

So, I was just wondering

No, I did not.

I believe that

21

a fire investigative search, the initial entry, does

22

not require a warrant or notice or no inconvenient time

23

and that is to some extent because of the exigency which

24

this Court has recognized in Michigan versus Tyler.

25

Take, for example, if —

In Tyler, the point was to remain,

MRS. BARTEE:

That is correct.

That is why

this Court would have to modify Tyler.

5

QUESTION:

6

MRS. BARTEE:

7

Let me give this Court an example.

Well, that is different.
That is correct.
If, for

8

example, a gas station develops a leak in its underground

9

tank and gas seeps through the soil and into the basement

10

of this house and flames ignite in that house, the extinguish­

11

ing of those flames in that basement does not extinguish

12

the potentially dangerous and volitile situation that

13

might be life threatening and, therefore, a fire may

14

rekindle in that basement, a fire may rekindle somewhere

15

else.

16

It is our position that the local government

17

spent a great deal of money and risked lives putting

18

out fires.

19

and residence than fires.

20

to determine the cause and origin of the fire and they

21

have the right to determine why that fire existed in

22

the first place and to ensure that a dangerous situation

23

does not still exist.

24
25

There is no greater threat to the property

QUESTION:

That they have the right

Let's not talk about rights.

Do

they have a duty to determine it?

1

I believe to some extent they

do and as the fire marshal is given the duty of inspect­

3

ing every fire which occurs in the City of Detroit and

these fire investigators fall within the fire marshal.

Now, your example about the leak,

itself?

9

this case?

10

I guess I am repeating Justice O'Connor's
Why do you have to cut back on Tyler to win

MRS. BARTEE:

Because I believe in Tyler this

11

Court was looking at the investigative entries and that

12

the investigators arrived while the flames were still

13

smoldering.

14

fighters arrive.

15

They were not looking at when did the fire­

I believe this case looks at it too, the first

16

initial investigative entry and this initial investigative

17

entry occurred while the — six hours after the flames

13

were extinguished.

21

QUESTION:

Had they stayed there for those

six hours, would the case be here?
MRS. BARTEE:

Absolutely.

Had they arrived

investigative entry occur.

QUESTION:

Will you let me speak, please.

I do not understand your negative answer to my inquiry.

I said, had they stayed there the entire six hours,

would not the case be different?

8

MRS. BARTEE:

10

That is correct, I am sorry.

I was thinking if they stayed after the six hours.
That is correct.
QUESTION:

11

And, had they stayed there for

12

six hours, they still couldn't investigate because of

13

six inches of water in the basement, isn't that correct?

That is correct.

Then why do you have to go outside

Then a new question —
So, even if they had arrived and

How could the understanding of

the officers make any possible difference?

It is very

ALDER80N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-0300

1

hard to understand your argument frankly.
MRS. BARTEE:

2

Well, because my argument would

3

be had they arrived six hours after the flames were

4

extinguished and they could have gone right on to the

5

premises.

6

to enter the premises and that the investigation could

7

have occurred without a warrant if the investigation

8

is seen as falling within the reasonableness clause

9

of the Fourth Amendment and that they couldn't possibly —

That that was a reasonable time for which

10

Well, a fire presents an independent justification for

11

entering those premises.

12

Let me apply —

13

QUESTION:

Aren't you, Mrs. Bartee, trying

14

to pass up a first down for a touchdown, you know, by

15

trying to suggest some distinctions from Tyler which

16

some of my colleagues have suggested are by no means

17

self evident?

18

MRS. BARTEE:

I believe if you limit Tyler

19

to its holding, and that is that there may be investi­

20

gative entries which can be deemed a continuous entry,

21

a continuum of the initial entry.

22

to its holding, we do not fit exactly under the facts.

23

If you limit Tyler

However, if you want to say that reasonably

24

that Tyler should be held to say that fire investigatros

25

may enter within a reasonable time after the flames

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

have been extinguished, then I believe you are correct.
Let me just shortly apply my four-prong test

2
3

to the fire situation.
QUESTION:

4

Before you do, I am still not sure

5

you have cleared up my concern about the lack of notice

6

here.

7

would not have needed notice.

8

of this case, wasn't it perfectly simply to give notice?

9

As I understand it, the insurance — everybody else

You gave me hypothetical example of where we

10

gave the owner notice.

11

MRS. BARTEE:

12

13
14
15

to give notice.

But, why, on the facts

The question is not is it practicable

It is notice required and I believe —

QUESTION:

You seem to concede it was required

on the facts of Tyler as I understand it.
MRS. BARTEE:

I will concede for additional

16

entries it would be required unless notice would defeat

17

the purpose.

18

that notice might defeat the purpose of the search.

19

But,- for the initial investigative entry,

And, in an arson situation, it is conceivable

20

I believe just the exigency of the fire itself and the

21

local governments, they have expended money and risked

22

lives, they have an interest and a right to determine

23

the cause and origin and to make that initial entry

24

without a warrant.

25

QUESTION:

You would say the same thing even

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

2

if the initial entry were three days later?
MRS. BARTEE:

Absolutely not.

I would have

3

to say reasonable time.

4

information required, that is my third prong, would

5

be reasonable time and reasonable time is not subject

6

to a precise definition.

7

QUESTION:

The entry — The quantum of

Well, let's say it was two hours

8

after the water had been cleaned up in the basement

9

instead of they had to wait.

10

MRS. BARTEE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MRS. BARTEE:

Could they have gone in?

I believe so.

I see.
I believe that reasonable time,

13

to follow up your answer — The starting point for reason­

14

able time would be that time within which the fire may

15

rekindle, but it could not end within time within which

16

a fire may rekindle because there may also be factors

17

beyond the control of the investigators which precludes

18

or hinders their initial investigation.

19

For example, in Tyler the steam and darkness

20

hindered the investigation.

It may be unsafe to make

21

that initial investigation.

A bulldozer may be required

22

to remove some debris to make that initial investigation

23

or, as in the instant case, water may have to be pumped

24

out of the basement to make that initial investigation.

25

So, reasonable time would require several

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

factors.

Some of these factors were discussed by this

2

Court in Tyler such as the attempt to secure the premises,

3

the continued use of the premises.

If you are responding to the question,

5

you may complete, but then you have used up all your

time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF K. PRESTON OADE, JR., ESQ.

Mr. Oade?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10

MR. OADE:

11
12

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As the Court is well aware petitioner in this

13
14

case is, in effect, asking this Court to overrule Camara

15

versus Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco,

16

a 1967 case, dealing with warrantless searches of the

17

physical condition of premises by building inspectors;

18

asking the Court to overrule See versus City of Seattle,

19

a fire inspection case, 1967; asking the Court to over­

20

rule Marshall v. Barlows, Inc., a warrantless search

21

under the occupational heath and safety provisions;

22

and they are asking the Court to overrule Michigan v.

23

Tyler.

24
25

The reason that petition perceives it necessary
to ask this Court to overrule those cases is because

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

whether this search is viewed in the context of an

2

administrative search or whether it is viewed in the

3

context of a criminal search, it is clear a warrant

4

was required under any case.

5

I submit to this Court that the Court need

6

not reach the question of whether these cases should

7

be overruled.

8

questions is because clearly a police officer has no

9

right to enter a private home, which this Court through

And, the reason it need not reach those

10

the years has protected and drawn the line that the

11

threshold of the home which the police officers or not

12

officials may enter, absent compelling cause, exigent

13

circumstances for a warrant.

14

QUESTION:

Now, some of the questions, Mr.

15

Oade — We are getting back to fundamentals about the

16

Fourth Amendment.

17

Amendment protection, the warrant protection?

18
19

MR. OADE:

What is the purpose of the Fourth

I think this case illustrates very

well, Mr. Chief Justice, the purpose of the Fourth Amendment.

20

QUESTION:

Well, without the merits of this

21

case, what is the broad purpose?

22

is

To protect privacy,

it not?

23

MR. OADE:

That is correct.

24

QUESTION:

Now, in this place they had anywhere

25

from six to a dozen firemen filing around the place

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

for many, many hours, and carpenters and whoever the

2

people wer manning the water pumps.

3

quite an interference with privacy by that time, hadn't

4

there?

5

MR. OADE:

There had been

Mr. Chief Justice, the firefighters

6

had a duty to fight that fire and they had a duty to

7

extinguish that fire and they had a duty to ensure that

8

that fire was put out.

9

had left the scene of those premises, the Cliffords

10

11

Thereafter, when the firefighters

had their insurance agent boarding those premises up.
The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is so

12

a police officer will not enter someone's private bedroom,

13

go through that person's closets, go through the drawers

14

of their dresser drawers to see if there is any evidence

15

in there that they can convict them of a crime.

16

QUESTION:

What if the firefighters had discovered,

17

in the process of their work while the fire was still

18

going on, bales of marijuane or kegs of heroin: and

19

that sort of thing?

20

MR. OADE:

Is it admissible?
Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

21

I can fairly concede that that is within plain view.

22

And, in fact, in this case we have a plain view situation

23

and the plain view is because the origin of the fire

24

here was very easily determined as being in the basement —

25

There was an odor of flammable liquid, there was a definite

2

stairwell and there was a can of Coleman fuel found

3

in that basement next to the point of origin.

4

firefighters found that can of fuel and they took that

can of fuel and seized it because it was in plain view

and they put it outside and then they gave a report

to the arson squad of probable arson.

Now, at that point, it is our contention that

10

it turned into a criminal investigation and if it was

11

not criminal at that point it was certainly criminal

by the time Lieutenant Beyer, who, by the way, I would

13

like the Court to know is a police officer.

14

Beyer is a member of the Detroit Police/Fire Arson Squard.

15

His function is to investigate criminality and prosecute

it as evidenced by the fact he was a witness in this

17

case, he performed their exam, as evidenced by the fact

18

he has powers of arrest, as evidenced by the fact that

11

MR. OADE:

I am not sure, Justice Rehnquist,

12

whether they had the power to arrest or not, but I think

13

that this Court has distinguished between administrative

14

and criminal searches based on the objects and intrusive­

15

ness of the search.

16

So, I submit to the Court, that, number one,

the object of the search was, what, criminal evidence?

is pretty well foreclosed by Tyler.
MR. OADE:

Well, I don't believe it is entirely

foreclosed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

4

QUESTION:

Why not?

5

MR. OADE:

And, the reason I don't is because

6

of the scope of the search itself in this case.

In

7

the Tyler case I think it was limited to a reasonable

8

search into cause and origin.

9

QUESTION:

But, you are talking — It may

10

be differentiated on the scope of the search.

certainly am not saying it isn't.

were trying to distinguish on the basis of the type

13

of officer who came.

MR. OADE:

I

But, I thought you

I wanted to make it clear to the

15

Court, because I am maintaining that this is a criminal

16

investigation.

17

QUESTION:

But, if Detective Webb was involved

18

in Tyler, there is certainly every presumption there

19

was a criminal investigation in Tyler too.

20

MR. OADE:

I think there was certainly a criminal

21

investigator present.

22

but I will not concede that the focus and object of

23

the search in Tyler was solely to gather fruits and

24

instrumentalities of crime.

25

I would certainly concede that,

And, I think it is clear in this case that

the scope of the search and what was seized was fruits

and instrumentalities of the crime.

3

illustrates why —

4

QUESTION:

I think the case

Mr. Oade, every time you discover

5

evidence of arson, it becomes the fruits of a crime,

6

doesn't it?

7

MR. OADE:

It does, but —

8

QUESTION:

So you would just say there can

9

never be an arson investigation under any circumstances,

10

that the exigent circumstances would never allow that,

11

is that your position?

12

14

MR. OADE:

No, that is not my position.

position —
QUESTION:

Well, if the officers were there

15

at the time the firefighters were there, would you think

16

they could have conducted this same search?

17
18

MR. OADE:

No, they could not.

And, I would

like to illustrate my point as follows:
Let's suppose they would have gotten an

20

administrative warrant to search for cause and origin.

21

I submit to the Court that one of the purposes of a

22

warrant is to limit the scope of a search.

lieve that a proper administrative warrant would have

instructed, whether they be police officers or fire­

25

fighters, would have instructed them to search for

Cause and origin of the fire was

QUESTION:

But, don't you concede under Tyler,

if they had been there when the firefighters were there,

5

that that much would have authorized them to make the

MR. OADE:

It would not have authorized —

You are asking us to overrule Tyler

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. OADE:

No, I am not.

12

I am not making myself clear.

13

No, I am not.

Maybe

Let's suppose that the firefighters in this

case had stayed at the scene and let's suppose that

15

they had stayed there for six hours and the water was

pumped out and they are trying to determine cause and

The fact is they took it upon

themselves to go up in this man's bedroom, to search

What if the fire had originated

MR. OADE:

Well, at least they would have

an arguable case that they were confining their search

to the less intrusive means.

Well, you suggest it is only arguable

that they could go into the bedroom if the fire had

MR. OADE:

I am saying that it is clear to

3

me, Justice Rehnquist, that the cause and origin of

4

the fire had no relationship to whatever personal effects

5

might have been present in my clients' bedroom.

6

QUESTION:

But, I asked you what if the cause

of the fire had been found in the bedroom and you say,

I believe that it is only arguable that the fire people

could have gone into the bedroom, even though the cause

of the fire was there.
MR. OADE:

I will concede if the origin of

to do so because of this continuation theory in Michigan

In other words, you predicted that there

MR. OADE:

I think a showing that there has

been a fire and it is of suspicious origin, that is

correct.

But, Justice Stevens, they had much more in

to decide the case as though it presents a question

I think that is true.

they could not enter at all or without an administrative

warrant?

12

MR. OADE:

I think they would have to — I

think they should, according to Tyler, they would have

to get an administrative warrant and the reason for

MR. OADE:

I

have been so brainwashed by this administrative search

idea that perhaps you are correct.

Clearly, in any event, they could have gotten

a warrant in this case and I maintained in my brief

3

that they could have gotten a probable cause warrant

and should have gotten a probable cause warrant because

they knew before they went into the house that it was

I think in all likelihood a magis­

MR. OADE:

I think that is —

18

QUESTION:

What is the exigent circumstance?

19

MR..OADE:

There is no exigent circumstance.

20

QUESTION:

Well, why may he search around?

MR. OADE:

The exigent circumstance was the

fact that there was a fire in the first place.

MR. OADE:

You posited a situation where some

exigent circumstance called him away.

16

QUESTION:

Well, there may be a lot of others.

17

MR. OADE:

And, one of those others was in
