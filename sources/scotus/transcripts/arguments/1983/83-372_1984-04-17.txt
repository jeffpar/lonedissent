ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. PATTI S. KITCHING, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5
6

MRS. KITCHING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
We are here today because the Ninth Circuit

7

8

has created an anomaly.

It has allowed one California

9

taxing agency to garnish property held by the Postal

10

Service on behalf of a third party,

but has prohibited

11

another state taxing agency from using a similar

12

garnishment.

13

analogous tax collection procedures.

This is even though both agencies use

In addition, seven circuits have found, and

14
15

the Postal Service concedes, that garnishment by

16

ordinary judgment creditors should be honored.
It must be emphasized that none of these

17
18

garnishments were on property belonging to the Postal

19

Service.

20

Postal

21

The garnishments were on property held by the

Service as a mere stakeholder.
The issue in this case, then, is whether the

22

Ninth Circuit should have allowed the Franchise Tax

23

Board to garnish the wages of Postal Service employees

24

who did not pay their California income tax.

25

California submits that there are two
3

1

controlling propositions in this case.

The first is

2

that the sovereign immunity of the Postal Service has

3

been waived, at least to the extent that it must honor a

4

garnishment for delinquent taxes on wages of employees.
The second preposition is that the Ninth

5
6

Circuit erred when it found that an unrelated federal

7

statute dealing only with wage withholding preempted the

8

Franchise Tax Board statute and garnishment.
This case arose because various Postal Service

9
10

employees did not pay their California income tax.

11

These taxes are not in dispute.

12

self-assessed or became final by assessment of the

13

Franchise Tax Board.

14

the Franchise Tax Eoard attempted to garnish the wages

15

of these employees, but the Postal Service refused to

16

honor the garnishment.
QUESTION^

17

They were either

In order to collect these taxes,

Ks. Kitching, is that the standard

procedure in California whereby the state collects

21

the IRS?

Yes, Your Honor.

are very similar to these of the IRS.

MBS. KITCHING:

This is true.

As I will

discuss a little later in more detail, before our tax

assessment becomes final, the taxpayer is given a

6

multitude of remedies.

7

several levels of administrative review before the

8

taxpayer has to pay the tax and before it comes final.

Once it —

Mrs. Kitching, what do you mean

1 1

when you say — or did you say that it's the same thing

as judicial judgment, that it's treated likewise?

We can levy cn

Well, file a lien, file a lien on

MRS. KITCHING:

10

Yes, yes.

It is given the

11

force of a judgment. Your Honor.

12

that is similar to that of the Internal Revenue

13

Service.

14

the taxpayer is given quite a bit of opportunity to

15

present his facts and theories about whether the tax

16

assessment is due.

It is.

And — and

That is the procedure in tax matters.

QUESTION:

Because

So what is the waiver of immunity

that you're relying on?
MRS. KITCHING:

19

In this case, first of all,

20

there's Section 401 of the Postal Reorganization Act

21

which found that the Postal Service may sue and be

22

sued.

23

of sovereign immunity, a sue and be sued clause, tc

24

find we believe we have the equivalent of a

5
6

QUESTION:

Do you think you're suing -- you're

suing -- you're suing the Postal Service?

7

HRS. KITCHING:

Yes, we are.

Just like a

8

judgment creditor would sue them if their garnishment

9

were not honored.

Sue and be sued is a term of art, and

10

it means that sovereign immunity has been waived tc a

11

certain degree.

12

included garnishment, and the reasoning in the Burr case

13

pointed out that the government's liability has not been

14

expanded.

15

and now a creditor is coming in and asking for the

16

money,

17

expanded.

They already owe the money to their employee,

and the liability of the government isn't

QUESTION:

The statute gives the right to sue

and be sued.

MRS. KITCHING:

Sc there's no question about that,

is there?

23

MRS. KITCHING:

QUESTION:

25

That's right.

We don't believe there is.

I take it that when you refer to

QUESTION;

First, it would

Bell, I gather, Mrs.

Hitching, your

10

whole argument, or do I correctly understand it, is that

11

you come within the sue and be sued waiver of sovereign

12

immunity because the assessment is treated like a

13

judicial judgment.

14

MRS. HITCHING;

HRS. HITCHING:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's your whole argument.
That is what we argue. Your

17

Honor.

18

Postal Service, and we believe that we should be given

19

at least equal respect to an ordinary judgment creditor

20

because we're a taxing agency trying to collect the

21

revenue for the State of California, and yet the Postal

22

Service will honor the levy of an ordinary judgment

23

creditor, and we think that's backwards.

24
25

We don't think it expands the liability of the

MRS. KITCHING;

Except that they didn’t find

any problem generally with the waiver of sovereign

immunity.

We would have won that case just as the

2

Employee Development Department did, we feel, had net

3

they felt Section 5517 precluded our recovery.

4

Therefore, we feel they would have found a waiver of

5

sovereign immunity, but that this statute stood in err

6

way and voided our state statute.
QUESTION•

7

Mrs. Pitching, why did California

8

not use the other way of having the government collect

9

the money for them?

California’s remedies are

Service are cumulative.

As I mentioned, there was a companion case.

24

The Employment Development Department also filed a

25

lawsuit because its garnishment was not honored.

10

They

their procedures are similar to those of the Franchise

They found that the sue and be sued clause had

the sovereign immunity of the Postal Service.
Also as I said, the Ninth Circuit found,

12

however, that our garnishment was preempted under the

13

facts of this case and because we had signed the

14

agreement with the federal government.

15

In essense, the Ninth Circuit decided that a

16

statute, 5 U.S.C. Section 5517, which was enacted to

17

help the states collect their revenue from all federal

18

employees, should be interpreted to prohibit the State

19

of California from garnishing the salary of Postal

20

Service employees.

21

The dissenting judge found that the Franchise

22

Tax Board's garnishment should be honored.

24

debts any differently than it would treat other debts.

The argument, I know, has proceeded

entirely on the question whether there's waiver of

14

Congress could have decided either to confer immunity or

15

not to confer immunity without even reaching the

16

question of labor.

17

But when you read Justice Douglas*

Do you agree that — that there would be

18

sovereign immunity here if Congress had said nothing at

19

all about this?

20

MRS. KITCHING*

We mentioned that in our brief

21

because of that comment in the Burr case, and we thought

22

it was an important issue.

23

don't think, in this case that there is no immunity.

I

think we -- even if there was seme kind of immunity, we

can argue that it was waived by the sue and be sued

18

We do net

Recognizing that the Postal Service is a mere

19

stakeholder in this case, a decision for the Franchise

20

Tax Board cannot be relied upon by other administrative

21

agencies to burden the Postal Service.

22

Furthermore, if a decision sustaining the

23

Franchise Tax Ecard is going to create the

24

administrative burden that's portrayed by the Postal

25

Service, then why wasn't the comparable and adverse
15

1

Employment Eevelopment Department decision appealed from

2

the Ninth Circuit?

3

Even though the Postal Service is simply a

4

stakeholder, it alleges that California's income tax

5

garnishment should not be honored.

6

7

immunity with regard to judicial proceedings.

8

argument does not recognize, however, the similarity of

9

tax assessment procedures tc judicial proceedings.

It argues that the

As I

10

stated, it was not necessary for California to obtain a

11

court judgment, because a tax assessment is given the

12

force of a judgment.
It should be given the force of a judgment

because the procedure conducted is much the same way as

GM Leasing -- GM Leasing was decided in 1976 by a

13

unanimous Court -- this Court affirmed the principle

14

that a tax assessment has the force of a judgment.

15

principle was necessary, as this Court explained,

16

because the existence of government depends upon the

17

expedient collection of its revenue.

18

In Bull v. United States and

The

Even though the foregoing principles have teen

19

recognized by this Court, the Postal Service refused to

20

give the Franchise Tax Board garnishment at least the

21

same respect to that of an ordinary judgment creditor.

It must be emphasized again that the Postal

23

Service is merely a stakeholder in these garnishment

proceedings.

During these proceedings it is not being

17

asked to turn over funds owing to employee taxpayers who

2

have refused to pay their valid state taxes.
The Postal Service will not remit these funds

3
4

to the Franchise Tax Board* yet it must make such

5

remittances to the Internal Revenue Service, in the

6

Ninth Circuit to the Employment Development Department,

7

and to ordinary judgment creditors.
It is significant to note that the rights of

8
9

these

judgment creditors were only recognized after

10

repetitious and unsuccessful litigation by the Postal

11

Service in seven circuit courts of appeals.

12

The Postal Service makes a secondary argument

13

with regard to the waiver of sovereign immunity and

14

attempts to support it with Section 5520 of 5 U.S.C.

15

That section authorizes the withholding of local income

16

taxes from federal employees.

17

»

The Postal Service alleges there would have

18

been no need to specifically include the Postal Service

19

in Section 5520 if sovereign immunity had been waived.

20

This is incorrect.

21

clear the Postal Service did not want to be included in

22

Section 5520.

23

each Postal Service employee could decide whether or not

24

he wanted to have local taxes withheld.

25

The legislative history makes it

It proposed separate legislation whereby

Congress was informed that the- history of the
18

1

Postal Service employees was one of delinquency in the

2

payment of their local taxes.

3

Service's recommendation of voluntary compliance was

4

completely rejected.

5

specifically included in order to remove all doubt that

6

it was required to comply with local withholding.

7

inclusion has nothing to do with sovereign immunity.

In 1974, California and the Department cf the

Treasury signed an agreement under Section 5517 which

21

implemented current withholding from federal employees.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

11
12

Very well.

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank ycu, Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The linchpin of my friend’s argument seems to

13
14

be that the California state administrative tax levy has

15

the force of a judgment or is the equivalent of a

16

judgme nt.

17

New, I don’t think that's true, but mere to

18

the point, I don’t think it’s fruitful to try to discuss

19

in the abstract whether the California administrative

20

levy has the force of a judgment.

21

Congress intended, and specifically, what Congress

22

intended when it enacted a routine sue and be sued

23

clause as part of the Postal Reorganization Act.

24

question is whether when Congress did this it intended

25

to subject the Postal Service to these administrative
23

The question is what

The

1

levies .
Now, in our view, when Congress said that the

2
3

Postal

4

meant that the Postal Service could be subject to a

5

lawsuit in court, net that the Postal Service could be

6

subject to an administrative order issued without any

7

judicial proceeding whatever.

8
9

Service could be sued, that's what it meant.

It

This Court has always interpreted sue and be
sued clauses according to their literal meaning.

A sue

10

and be sued clause authorizes a lawsuit.

11

sued clause does net say and it does not mean that

12

sovereign immunity has simply become inapplicable tc a

13

federal agency's affairs.

14

Now,

A sue and be

I think that what's happened is because

15

sue and be sued clauses are so common and familiar, the

16

Franchise Tax Board has succumbed to the temptation to

17

forget that it is, after all, language in a statute, and

18

it's to be interpreted in the first instance at least

19

according to its plain meaning.

20

the Court has interpreted sue and be sued clauses and

21

when Congress was including —

22

QUESTION;

That is, as I said, how

Well, what's — what may -- why is

23

it the plain meaning of the statute that the Postal

24

Service may be garnished pursuant to a court judgment?

25

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, in FHA against Burr this
24

1

Court said that garnishment, postjudgment garnishment is

2

an incident of a suit.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well,

that may be, but the Postal

Service isn't being sued.
MR. STRAUSS:

5

Well, that argument was made in

6

FHA against Burr, too, and the Court's answer was that

7

the garnishor -QUESTION:

8
9

than being sued or sued.
NR. STRAUSS:

10
11

Sc the clause really means more

No.

The Court's answer was that

the garnishor was standing in the shoes of the employee.
QUESTION:

12

All right.

So what if the

13

California law says final administrative assessments

14

have the force of a judgment?

They're unchallengeable.

15

They're just like a judgment.

And then you garnish the

16

Postal Service in connection with this judgment.
MR. STRAUSS:

17

As long as it is not part cf a

18

lawsuit, and there is no contention here that it is part

19

of a suit.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Well, part of the state law says

it's the equivalent of a lawsuit in the judgment.
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, state law can't alter the

23

meaning of the federal law.

I don’t deny that there may

24

be cases in which it’s hard to tell what's an

25

administrative proceeding and what's a suit, but this is
25

1

plainly not such a case.
QUESTION!

2

After --

Is — is your basic reason for that

3

that your concept of sue and be sued clause means a

4

garnishment issuing out of a process of a court?
MR. STRAUSS;

5
6

That's right.

In connection

with a lawsuit.
QUESTION:

7

Sc that if these -- if the

8

administrator here instead of garnishing on the

9

assessment went to court and got a state court judgment,

10

there could be a garnishment.
MR. STRAUSS:

11

Yes.

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

12

If the Franchise Tax Board were to reduce its tax

13

delinquencies to judgments --

14

QUESTION;

Even though the -- even though the

15

state law says don’t do it because you already have a

16

judgment.

17
18
19

20

MR. STRAUSS:
says don’t do it.
QUESTION:

I don't know that the state law

My understanding is that state law —
Well, it doesn’t say don’t do it,

but it says that you already have the judgment.

21

QUESTION:

But they did say it.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

No.

There’s no -- this is not

23

-- this is not — one of the ways in which this is net a

24

judgment is that after it is issued, someone else can

25

institute a suit to challenge it.
26

The judicial

proceedings in the California courts begin after this

order has been issued and they be done by someone else

What can happen after this

assessment becomes what's called a judgment under state
law?

What can happen after that?

11

MR. STRAUSS:

I -- I don't know that there's

12

any place in the state statutes where it is called a

13

judgment.

After it's —
QUESTION:

14

Well, I knew, but let's assume —

15

anyway, there's a final assessment, is that it?

16

your colleague on the ether side says that's the

17

equivalent of a judgment under our — under our law.

18

What can happen to it after that?
MR. STRAUSS:

20

23
24
25

Well, my understanding is it’s

served on the employer, and it’s the employer -QUESTION:

21
22

And

Well, I knew, but how about the

taxpay er?
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the taxpayer, if the

employer honors it, the taxpayer —
QUESTION:

Well,

what about the taxpayer?
27

1

Forget about the garnishment for a minute

2

ME. STRAUSS;

3

QUESTION:

4

Okay.

The taxpayer --

There's a final assessment.

What

can the taxpayer do about it besides paying?
MR. STRAUSS;

5

The taxpayer has to challenge it

6

administratively, and if the administrative challenge

7

does not succeed, the taxpayer has to institute a suit.

8

The suit then works its way up through the California

9

courts and to this Court if there's a federal issue.
QUESTION:

10
11

So the tax assessment is not final

in the sense that the taxpayer can never challenge it.
MR. STRAUSS;

12

Oh, certainly not, certainly

13

not.

14

mean in a sense, tc put the point bluntly, this is nc

15

more like a judgment than any tort.

16

taken by one person against another that can give rise

17

to a lawsuit if the person who is -- who is at loss as a

18

result of the action chooses to challenge it.

19

Otherwise, it has no connection to a lawsuit.

20

The taxpayer goes to court to challenge it.

QUESTION;

I

It’s an action

Of course, if the taypayer — if

21

the taxpayer-employee of the Postal Service gets

22

garnished, like California wants to do, and they take

23

the money cut of his pay, and then he challenges the

24

tax, he's going to get his money back.

25

he's having to pay in advance.
28

It's just that

1
2

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right, if he successfully

challenges the tax.

3

It's not just that.

It's that the Postal

4

Service will have to divert its funds from the objects

5

for which Congress designated now, the payment of this

6

employee, in advance until the matter is resolved.

7

I shouId also -QUESTION:

8

Well, now, what do you mean?

And

Ycu

9

mean the Postal Service, even though it’s holding funds

10

under a garnishment, nevertheless would feel obligated,

11

holding this week’s salary under a writ of garnishment,

12

would, feel obligated to pay the salary to the employee?
MR. STRAUSS:

13

Oh, no.

It wouldn't feel

14

obligated to pay the salary to the employee, but it

15

would -- the basis of the doctrine in this area is that

16

it disrupts Congress' design for a federal agency to

17

have tc pay funds to the creditor instead of to the

18

employee.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but the sue and be sued

20

clause certainly covers that if the garnishment issued

21

out of court.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right.

If the

23

garnishment is issued postjudgment, that's right.

24

That’s right.

25

QUESTION:

But if this were a judgment, it
29

1

would be collected from the Post Office?

2
3

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

5

MR. STRAUSS:

7
8

11

12

California could do it?
Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

Absolutely.

If the Franchise Tax -QUESTION:

So the only problem here is the

word "judgment?"
MR. STRAUSS:

The problem is that California

hasn't sued us.
QUESTION:

Is that the one thing, the word

"judgm ent?"

13

MR. STRAUSS:

14

"judgment" or the word

QUESTIGN:

That's all that's involved.

QUESTION;

It’s a distinction for purposes of

Mr. Strauss, are there any cases in

which this Court has held that a federal agency is net

12

immune from judicial process but is immune from some

13

kind of administrative process?

14

16

MR. STRAUSS;

I don't know that this issue has

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, that's -

That's what Justice Frankfurter

said is the issue.

MR. STRAUSSs

right in the case cf agencies like those involved in

there was taking that agency, and he said this -- this

looks exactly like these other 40 agencies to which

any difference, Justice Stevens.

15

QUESTION;

Okay.

16

MR. STRAUSS;

17

The one other point that I think is important

That’s our position.

18

is that in this case in addition to the plain language

19

of the statute, language interpreted by this Court to

20

mean suits, we have unusually strong, if somewhat

21

unconventional, evidence that the very congressional

22

committees that drafted the Postal Reorganization Act

23

and put the sue and be sued clause into it would have

24

been very surprised to learn that they had rendered the

25

Postal

Service subject to orders like the Franchise Tax
35

1

Boa rd
Shortly after the Postal Reorganization Act

3

took effect, municipal tax collectors from several major

4

cities came to Congress and complained that local income

5

tax delinquencies of federal employees had become a

6

serious problem.

7

Service employees were frequently the subject of this

8

discussion, apparently because they're very large in

9

number, they're present in every city, and the turnover

And as my friend pointed out, Postal

10

in Postal Service jobs is very rapid, and

11

collection more difficult.

12

that makes

How, these local tax collectors sought

13

legislation from Congress that would permit the

14

withholding of local income taxes from the wages and

15

salaries of federal employees.

16

Now, as I said, this proposed legislation was

17

considered by the same committees that had recently

18

drafted the Postal Reorganization Act.

19

Office and Civil Service Committees of both Houses.

20

It was the Post

Now, the Board concedes in its brief that if

21

its interpretation of the sue and be sued clause were

22

correct, the local tax collectors did not need any

23

additional legislation to deal with the Postal Service.

24

They could just have issued administrative orders to the

25

Postal Service, as they would have to any other employer.
36

1

QUESTION:

Well, is that quite that clear?

2

think there’s something to your opponent’s distinction

3

between withholding and levy under assessment.

4

ME. STRAUSS*

Well, the California statutes

5

provide that withholding taxes can be collected in

6

precisely the same way; in fact, under the very same

7

statutory provision.
QUESTION:

10

that should have been withheld from an employee?
MR. STRAUSS:

employer should have withheld from the employee.

about withholding taxes that the employer owes or taxes

12

I

Yeah.

I don’t think that's quite

the sa me.
MR. STRAUSS:

15

Well, if -- if -- I mean this is

16

not — I think this point, Justice Rehnquist, is net in

17

dispute; that if the sue and be sued clause means what

18

the Franchise Tax Board says it mean, that

19

legislation sought by the local tax collectors and

20

subsequently passed, the Section 5520 of Title 5, is, in

21

their words, superfluous?
QUESTION;

22

Why?

this

I don't understand that.

23

Just — you're talking about just withholding current

taxes.

Post Office Department would have any authority

37

whatsoever to withhold from an employee's pay state

MR. STRAUSS;

I don’t -- I don't know why not,

if state process allows it, as state process would.

8

There is no federal bar — there would be no federal bar

to the taxing authority issuing an order, an

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

And

I don't knew whether

15

Virginia is a more favored state, but in Virginia,

16

residents of Virginia who work for the federal

17

government have their Virginia tax taken out of their

18

federal salary.

19

MR. STRAUSS;

Ch, yes.

That's -- that's

20

pursuant to legislation, 5517.

That’s right.

21

statutes are now on the books.

My point is that at the

22

time that the local tax collectors asked for that

23

legislation, they came to Congress right in the wake of

24

the Postal Reorganization Act, asked that legislation

25

with respect to the Postal Service, and were not told
40

Those

why do you need this legislation; we gave you what ycu

We don't claim that this suit is barred by

QUESTION:

20

Then

We claim that we win this suit on

Mr. Strauss,

should our

21

interpretation of the sue and be sued clause in Section

22

401 be affected in any way by our understanding of

23

Congress* intent in trying to set up an independent

24

agency

25

and intent of Congress help us in determining the scope

with the Postal Service?

41

Should the structure

1
2

of the sue and be sued clause?
Now, while it isn *t set up totally as an

3

independent business, as you've already said, Congress

4

attempted to move in that direction and give the Postal

5

Service more businesslike attributes and make it a mere

6

independent agency.

7

attributes might well be that it should be subject tc

8

administrative withholdings in the nature of a

9

garnishment such as this.

10

And it seems to me one of those

MR. STRAUSS:

Is that possible?

Well, I don't think there's any

11

reason to think that's true, Justice O'Connor.

12

Congress -- it's true that Congress did change the

13

organization of the Postal Service in seme ways, but it*

14

did also put in a sue and be sued clause.

15

construction of that clause that's really at issue.

16

Now,

What

And it's the

I should say that I suspect when the

17

drafters of the act put in the sue and be sued clause,

18

they did net -- probably did not envision that they were

19

opening up the Postal Service to whole waves of new

20

kinds of litigation.

21

doing very little.

22

of the clause in the legislative history, and from all

23

appearances they treated it as a piece of --

24
25

QUESTION;

They probably thought they were
There is no explicit consideration

Well,

I don't know that whole waves

of litigation is an accurate description.
42

This seems

1

like a pretty normal state activity to want to collect

2

its taxes and to treat the administrative garnishment

3

much like a judicial garnishment.

4

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, it is — it is a

5

qualitatively different form of process from that to

6

which federal agencies are subject.

7

that if they tried -- if the Franchise Tax Beard tried

8

to serve one of these levies on any other federal agency

9

that the agency would not have to honor it.

There is no dispute

There is,

10

take it, no dispute that if the Franchise Tax Eoard had

11

sued this levy on the Post Office Department before

12

1971,

13

So* the only question is whether Congress withdrew that.

the Post Office would not have had to honor it.

When Congress passed the sue and be sued

14
15

clause, I should point out it also made the provisions

16

of the

17

heavy qualification on any waiver of immunity from suit

18

applicable to the Postal Service.

QUESTION;

Are there a fair number of agencies

with sue and be sued clauses who are not protected, as
43

1

you suggest, by the Federal Tort Claims Act?

2
3

MB. STRAUSS:
Rehnguist.

4

I don't know, Justice

I don't knew the answer to that question.
QUESTIONS

May I ask if -- if you win this

5

case and the California legislature passed a statute and

6

said that before serving any levies on or tax

7

assessments on the U.S. Postal Service, you shall go

8

over to the nearest judge and get it signed by a judge,

9

and then you may serve it, would that cure the problem?
MR. STRAUSS:

10

That's — that begins to get

11

into this — into this borderline area that comes up in

12

these ether instances in which the Court has to

13

distinguish between state administrative agencies and

14

state judicial bodies, like Lynch against Hasl.
QUESTION:

15
16

Well, it wouldn't take much mere

than that, in any event, would it?
MR. STRAUSS*

17

Well, at some point the

18

intervention of a judicial officer would make this a

19

judicial proceeding, that's right.
QUESTION:

20

And how — how does it matter to

21

the United States whether that intervention takes place

22

or not?

23

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I think there are two

24

answers to that, Justice Stevens.

25

-- the Postal Service itself is the party in interest,
44

When the Post Office

1

when the state, or for that matter it's just

2

adventitious that this case involves a state, when a

3

private party is trying to invoke state administrative

4

process to obtain Postal Service assets because he has a

5

dispute with the Postal Service.

6

If he proceeds against the Postal Service in

7

state court, the Postal Service can remove the

8

proceeding.

9

would have the right to get out of state court and into

Congress saw to it that the Postal Service

10

federal court when it wanted tc.

11

it in a state administrative agency, the Postal Service

12

can't remove it.

13

If he proceeds against

When the — when the Postal Service is net the

14

real party in interest, when it's, as this case, the

15

Postal Service is holding funds --

16

QUESTION;

Well, let me limit my question to

17

cases in which an official authority, an official

18

representative of the State of California is proceeding

19

against the government agent.

20

difference whether you get the intervention of the

21

judicial officer or not?

22
23
24
25

ME. STRAUSS;

Can it then make any

I think it can, at least for

purposes of removal.
QUESTION;

You mean if there — I don't knew

what you'd remove if they serve you with an assessment.
45

1

You're not -- the Postal Service doesn't have any

2

interest in contesting the amount of the assessment,

3

would it?

4

MS. STRAUSS;

Oh, no.

That's why I confined

5

my answer tc cases in which the Postal Service is the

6

real party in interest.

7

QUESTIONS

8

MR. STRAUSS;

9

Oh, I see.

I see.

In cases like this, the — the

interest is different and in a way greater.

I think

10

from the point of view of the employee who is subject to

11

this levy, it makes a great deal of difference whether

12

he has been sued and has been to court and has had a

13

chance to have his defenses heard and has a final

14

judgment entered against him and —
QUESTIONS

15
16

Well, but under Burr a sue and be

sued clause allows garnishment prior tc judgment.
MR. STRAUSS;

17

Well, under Pretty the sue and

18

be sued clause allows attachment of a federal agency

19

when you have a dispute with the federal agency.

20

Court has not yet held that prejudgment wage garnishment

The

21

QUESTION;

22

Well, but certainly Burr has dicta

23

in it.

So I mean you're not -- in answer to Justice

24

Stevens, you're — you're not talking basically abcut a

25

situation in either case where there's been a final
46

1

adjudication of the right.

2

HR. STRAUSS:

Well, if — if — if the case

3

involves prejudgment wage garnishment. Justice

4

Rehnquist, that’s right that there’s been nc final

5

adjudication, of course.

6

said about that.

7

gather, is practically no longer used because it’s sc

8

difficult to conform to procedural requirements.

9

But there are two things tc be

Prejudgment wage garnishment, I

And second, I think it does make a difference

10

if the employee is already in court, and he’s involved

11

in a judicial proceeding, and his rights and liabilities

12

are going to be determined, and he doesn't have to

13

initiate a suit.
QUESTION:

14

But in response to that, you

15

earlier told me it didn't matter if he had to pay the

16

judgment -- pay the assessment in order to challenge

17

it.

18

You’d still take the same position.
NR. STRAUSS:

Well, if the state law required

19

that the employee would have to pay the assessment, yes,

20

I think as far as the Postal Service was concerned, we

21

would still say that like other federal agencies, we

22

don't have to honor this assessment at all.

23

know where that would leave the employee under state law.

24
25

QUESTION:

I don’t

Mr. Strauss, describe to me what

California would have to do to make this law compatible
47

1

with ycur views of a judicial decision.

2

MR. STRAUSS;

3

QUESTION;

It would hav’e —

You have the tax board, and the tax

4

court finds a delinquency in the payment of state income

5

ta xes.

6

MR. STRAUSS;

7

QUESTION;

That’s right.

At that point would the statute

8

have to provide that -- that the state would have tc~go

9

to court to enforce the delinquency?

10
11
12
13
14

MR. STRAUSS;

The statute wouldn't have tc

provide that in order to collect from the Postal Service.
QUESTION;

Well, — well, if — if — if the

state went to court, would it sue the Postal Service?
MR. STRAUSS;

It would sue -- I don’t knew

15

what the form of the suit would be.

16

of the suit would be against the taxpayer.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. STRAUSS;

I suppose the ferm

The taxpayer.
But what the Court said in Eurr

19
20

QUESTION;

Sc that the tax -- the tax board

21

has already found that the taxpayer owes them money and

22

had, as I understand it from the Attorney General, a due

23

process hearing an<^ lost.

24

California now would have to provide an additional

25

procedure in which

Are you suggesting that

there would be a trial before a judge?
48

1

MR. STRAUSS;

My understanding, Justice

2

Powell, is that they don't have to provide any adversary

3

— I think they may as a matter of state law, but they

4

don't have to provide any adversary hearing at all.
QUESTION;

5

They don't now under California

6

law, but I'm trying to ascertain what California would

7

have to do to comply with what you said it must dc

8

before it can garnishee the salary owed by the Postal

9

Servic e.
MR. STRAUSS;

10

They would have to go to court,

11

Justice Powell.

12

for that is that that's what the statute says.

13

authorizes the Postal Service to be sued, and the Court

14

has said —

They would have to sue.

QUESTION;

15

And cur reason
It

Even though the administrative

16

agency provided all of the due process that a court

17

would provide?

18

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, if an — if it were a

19

court and not an administrative agency, and as I've

20

said,

21

there are borderline cases.
QUESTION;

But this is a --

Well, there are regulatory

22

commissions in every state in the United States as well

23

as in the government that have both judicial and

24

administrative legislative powers.

25

MR. STRAUSS;

That’s right.

49

There is no

1

contention, as I understand, that they are, in fact, a

2

court, and so they would have to go to court and sue.

3

QUESTIONS

4

MR. STRAUSS:

5

QUESTION:

They would.
Yes.

And that's --

They wouldn't have to go to

6

judgment to get to this point.

I suppose 90 percent of

7

all the garnishments in the United States are

8

prejudgement.

9

as the first process.

The garnishment is served on the same day
So as a practical matter, if they

10

did it that way in California, started the suit, served

11

the garnishment, it would wash out because they would

12

probably have no defense in the vast majority of the

13

cases.

14

MR. STRAUSS:

My impression, Mr.

Chief

15

Justice, is that prejudgment wage garnishments are not

16

widely used any more because of Snydak and other

17

decisions imposing strict procedural requirements on

18

them,

19
20

and that they're not a very popular remedy.
QUESTION:

That doesn't comport with studies

on the subject.

21

MR. STRAUSS:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, as I said --

They were reduced after Snydak, but

they’re still overwhelmingly prejudgments.
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, that was my impression

from — from the government's experience with
50

1

garnishment orders.

2

But the question is whether Congress could

3

have distinguished, the Congress, whether it makes sense

4

to attribute to Congress a distinction between

5

garnishments issued incident to or pursuant to or an

6

execution of a lawsuit or an order to give a court

7

jurisdiction,

8

that are not connected to a court or to judicial process

9

at all.

find orders that are not garnishments,

And in view of this Court's — since the

10

question in the case is the interpretation of a sue and

11

be sued clause, and since the Court has consistently

12

said that sue and be sued clauses have to do with

13

judicial process and judicial proceedings, I think the

14

best understanding of Congress' intent is that it did

15

intend tc subject the Postal Service only to orders

16

connected to court proceedings or judicial proceedings

17

and not to unadjudicated administrative orders.

18
19

If the Court has no further questions,

thank

you .

MRS. KITCHING*

23

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts

24

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

25

MRS. KITCHING:

Ms. Kitching.

The Postal Service apparently
51

1

does not feel confident of the preemption argue, since

2

they devoted only about two pages in their brief tc that

3

argument, and has not addressed that argument today.

4

Therefore, we feel basically that they are arguing the

5

sovereign immunity.
As I said before, the Franchise Tax Board

6
7

feels it comes directly under the Burr case and that it

8

is not expanding any liability of the Postal Service.

9

The Postal Service would not have to divert any of its

10

own funds.

11

Service.

The funds do not belong to the Postal
They belong to the employee.

12

The Solicitor General has admitted that the

13

collection of taxes from Postal Service employees has

14

become very difficult, and we submit that the Postal

15

Service should cooperate with the State of California in

16

collecting these taxes.

17

however, the Postal Service attempts tc raise the shield

18

of sovereign immunity to protect delinquent taxpayers.

19

QUESTION;

Instead of being helpful,

Well, while you're on policy, why

20

don't you have the postal authority to deduct it, to

21

withhold it?

22

HRS. KIT CHING;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

Pardon me?

Why don't you have the postal

KRS. KITCHING;

can have a certain amount withheld.

5

can earn money from other sources and end up with a

6

So that's not the only way to collect the tax, and

8

sometimes it isn't enough.

9

QUESTION;

That's right, Your Honor.

We

However, employees

Well, you don't expect the postal

10

authority to collect the money that they work on outside

11

jobs, do you?

12

HRS. KITCHING;

No, we don't.

But I'm

13

explaining that's why the taxpayer would have an

14

additional tax liability that it would be necessary to

15

collect through garnishment.
